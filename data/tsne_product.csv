Powered by Caudalie’s breakthrough patent of stabilized vine resveratrol (for firmness) and micro hyaluronic acids (for volume), the cream works to visibly recontour, refirm, and replump aging skin. For the first time, these molecules' synergy is being harnessed to support skin's natural production of hyaluronic acid, so the skin is plumped from within.

Sourced from grapevine stalks, Vine resveratrol is an antiaging revolution that naturally intensifies the visible firmness and youthfulness of the skin. No other molecule has fueled as much hope for health, notably in the field of cell degeneration. Grapevines have an incredible power to resist the harsh effects of the cold, wind and rain to live for up to 100 years. Their secret? Resveratrol, a substance that the vine produces to protect itself. ` Research results:In an in vitro test on genic expression; vine resveratrol with micro hyaluronic acids: - Boosts the skin’s own production of hyaluronic acid by 226% In a self-assessment with 42 volunteers, after 3 months of once-daily application: - 100% of the volunteers feel that their skin is nourished - 100% of the volunteers feel that their skin is firmed - 93% of the volunteers feel that their skin complexion is brighter - 93% of the volunteers feel that their skin is lifted - 88% of the volunteers feel that their skin is plumper - 88% of the volunteers feel that their skin looks younger - 81% of the volunteers feel that the wrinkles are smoothed - 76% of the volunteers feel that their facial contours are redefined Maximum improvement reached after 3 months on the biomechanical properties of skin: - 100% of volunteers saw +15% improvement in skin firmness - 93% of volunteers saw -39% reduction of skin sagging - 88% of volunteers saw +13% plumper skin",1.7,76,1,0.023653823882341385,5.737203121185303,feat_20,feat_8,feat_10,feat_23,feat_6,my skin is glowing,this is wonderful if your skin is going through a rough patch or it's the dead of winter,i can't believe the difference,i also don't have to use too much in comparison to the serum,the texture is incredible

Preventive action against spots is one of the most effective ways to achieve lasting efficacy on skin evenness and color correction.Edelweiss is cultivated at the heart of the Valais Garden in Switzerland at an altitude of 1,100 m.

What it does: Urban Decay’s Rehab Makeup Prep Hot Springs Hydrating Gel hydrates, balances, and energizes your complexion after cleansing. Made for prepping skin for makeup, this benefit-packed gel has an ultra-lightweight, watery feel. Unlike a traditional moisturizer that creates a slippery surface for makeup, Hot Springs Hydrating Gel absorbs quickly to leave skin looking plump and healthy. The encapsulated water in the gel, which is sourced from a 1,000-year-old hot spring in Japan, bursts on contact, creating a cooling effect. Water from hot springs is rich in skin-nourishing minerals, and because the water in this formula is also hypotonica purer formit penetrates the skin’s barrier better and becomes absorbed more easily. The result is instant hydration that leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth, and not greasy. Since the gel is low alkaline, it helps to balance out the pH of the complexion. Perfect for everyday use, the light gel formula leaves skin feeling soft, significantly more hydrated, and ready for the perfect foundation application. Every skin type needs moisture to even out the surface textureincluding oily skin. Hydration plumps and smooths skin so makeup goes on better and more evenly, and it helps reduce dry spots that can make makeup look flaky on the skin.
