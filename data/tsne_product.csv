What it does: Urban Decay’s Rehab Makeup Prep Hot Springs Hydrating Gel hydrates, balances, and energizes your complexion after cleansing. Made for prepping skin for makeup, this benefit-packed gel has an ultra-lightweight, watery feel. Unlike a traditional moisturizer that creates a slippery surface for makeup, Hot Springs Hydrating Gel absorbs quickly to leave skin looking plump and healthy. The encapsulated water in the gel, which is sourced from a 1,000-year-old hot spring in Japan, bursts on contact, creating a cooling effect. Water from hot springs is rich in skin-nourishing minerals, and because the water in this formula is also hypotonica purer formit penetrates the skin’s barrier better and becomes absorbed more easily. The result is instant hydration that leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth, and not greasy. Since the gel is low alkaline, it helps to balance out the pH of the complexion. Perfect for everyday use, the light gel formula leaves skin feeling soft, significantly more hydrated, and ready for the perfect foundation application. Every skin type needs moisture to even out the surface textureincluding oily skin. Hydration plumps and smooths skin so makeup goes on better and more evenly, and it helps reduce dry spots that can make makeup look flaky on the skin.
