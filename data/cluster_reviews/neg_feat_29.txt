my skin started to be oily after 4-5hr of use.
waiting longer after serum
i appreciate the formulation of this product
just a typical lotion or primer
hoped with the oatmeal ingredients that it would be soaking
i love the enzyme powder
cream i went for this cream
before spending the $ i suggest trying cheaper facial oils
however it did zero exfoliation on my skin over multiple treatments
a skin care specialist at sephora told me that polyvinyl alcohol
i find the serum too light for a night moisturizer
don't need a separate serum
this is unlike most serums
i went back to a more creamy serum
which i've found are a lot more moisturizing
goes on and feels just like aloe vera.
stick with the aloe vera
this serum was just ok.
the texture is more like a gel cream
i wouldn't purchase this serum again
this would be a great serum for overnight.
while it was ok at moisturizing
this serum made my skin really smooth
i stopped using this serum
the serum is okay
fab products tend to pill on my skin
especially this serum once i apply moisturizer over it
not really a serum- it's a gel.
i went through an entire bottle of this serum using almost daily
it feels like aloe vera gel.
i gave this serum a shot two times.
this is more like a gel moisturizer -- nice
like to use a hydrating serum followed by a light moisturizer to keep my dry
almost all non-gel moisturizers clog my pores
it markets as a hydrating serum
going back to my vichy hydrating serum
it has the texture of a gel
i think it is moisturizing.
its not irritating and hydrating.
the word serum in the name is misleading though this is a gel texture not a typical more fluid texture of a serum
it was my first time using a serum
i like to put on toners
this moisturizer may be good for people who have oily or combination skin
i think it's not as hydrating as other serums
i need another more moisturizing product over it
love their eye cream serum because it absorbs well
more hydrating to use a cream-type cleanser from a pump bottle
for a price of $75 i expected this serum to work wonders
this serum has a pleasant fragrance
fine as a mosturizing serum, i guess.
like a serum that actually does what it claims to do
it is a good moisturizer
i believe they showed me a moisturizer.
this eye cream from clinique is okay.
felt moisturizing around my eyes
giving this a 3 star rating because i use it as a moisturizing base before i apply my make up in the morning
it did not have a hydrating nor brightening effect
i like this cream.
while it is really moisturizing
i love the 2in1 cleanser from this clinique line
whenever i apply my tarte shapetape concealer after i apply the eye cream
i felt like this moisturizer
helped my concealer go on smoother
it moisturizes my under eye
the best i can say is its a passable moisturizer for under my concealer
it saves me using up my $55 moisturizer
it did moisturize my skin.
i also feel like this is less moisturizing than the other cream
this sunscreen was way toooo thick
other than that the serum itself feels nice
this was not very moisturizing
i appreciate other murad products like the oil-free sunscreen
'tis a shame since i was interested in this nourishing blend of sunscreen for winter-spring
they said that the sunscreen in this product can do that
feels more likea lotion
this sunscreen should come with a warning.
not too heavy with the added benefit of sunscreen
also wanted one with sunscreen
it also has the scent of sunscreen which i don't care for
basically, i've used better moisturizers.
i wanted something a little more emollient for winter
i also like that it has a little more sunscreen.
even with the perfecting serum
this sunscreen is fine
all over-the-counter sunscreens i've tried sting my sensitive skin
tried this product to help moisturize
lighter than most night creams
it's lighter than the vitamin c one
left my undereyes purple with a full dose
my concealer is still creasing
i don't have acne-prone skin
i will be continuing the search for a good serum.
it also pills under powders
after cleaning, my serum, and heavy night cream.
i finish with a final layer of vitamin c light lotion
as a facial cream, it is not hydrating enough.
when do you moisturize?
what if i need a moisturizer?
get some botox or fillers instead
i would not purchase this moisturizer.
as a moisturizer it's ok.
not for aging skin.
i'll stick to fillers and botox from now on.
it has a medicinal smell, too.
many better retinol/retinoids products out there.
it's not overly chemically scented
it's an average cleanser
i do recommend the the exfolikate 2 min facial that made my skin so smooth
while this product was cleansing
i kept using the cleanser
how you didn't need toner while using it
i still feel like i need a toner after
i went three weeks without a toner
i also like that it's sulfate free
i also don't see where this is exfoliating.
this cleanser is so drying.
it's a cleanser that foams
the serum in the rollerball is great
the serum is very nice
this isn't the holy grail of wrinkle treatments
when i use patches i use serum two times.
the serum barely comes out of the rollerball
i love this moisturizer
it works better as a nighttime moisturizer.
for me, i'll stick to my usual moisturizer.
it helped with acne, it helped with redness.
it helped with hydration.
my old face moisturizers weren't cutting it
i even used acne medication
decided to try this instead of my usual josie maran moisturizer with spf
i can't use a toner with it or it balls up.
it did moisturize though
the josie maran argan daily moisturizer spf 47
there are pros and cons to this lotion.
i find this lotion to definitely be moisturizing
josie maran body lotion is the bomb
i am not a huge fan of physical exfoliation
the only thing i liked was the sugar exfoliation when i rinsed it off
for using all natural ingredients
plus i use my clarisonic every night with rose water toner afterwards
'm slathering on a good moisturizer
use an oil cleanser when i don't
it is a foamy cleanser
for a cleanser that claims to be lightly hydrating
murad's daily cleansing foam causes less dryness for me for whatever reason
i started with this cleanser
uses cleanser once a day
i would like something more exfoliating.
murad refreshing skin cleanser is non-drying
caused my foundation to pill
it gave me acne
i wanted to like this for the retinol
the brillian future serum is okay
it feels like a serum
i also was under the impression this would be exfoliating
i gave it two stars because it is moisturizing
the serum is nice
i wouldn't even put it in the class of a serum
also, be warned that this serum contains alcohol.
this serum did nothing for me.
i really wanted to love this serum.
face creams/lotions made my skin so smooth
don't rely on sunshine oil alone for moisturizing
i love milk makeup
their hero salve is my go to moisturizer
then a moisturizing cream after washing my face at night
josie maran's argan oil as an example
i typically use pure jojoba oil on my face as it's the most similar oil to natural sebum
half an ounce of cheap oils for almost $40?
i also got the matcha stick toner
i love the stick toner so far!
i love facial oils!
it doesn't moisturize at all
like an orange cleaning solvent for your house
i usually use josie maran argan oil
they make a marula oil
it's like putting gel deodorant on your face
eat food with less salt
settle for aloe vera
moisturizing when it goes on
i could get the same amount of moisture from another moisturizer
my face moisturizer is over 3 fl oz
moisturizing feeling does not last
i'd prefer to just use pure aloe over this.
this sunscreen is something that is supposed to be applied generously to the face
any fragrance natural or synthetic in skincare products causes internal irritation when used for an extended period of time
i wanted to love this moisturizer.
i didn't like the fact that it contains chemical sunblock
would have to use a separate sunscreen with it anyway
it smelled straight like sunscreen
i want a moisturizer with sunscreen
i started using the murad mattifying oil control moisturizer for my face instead
i just recently started moisturizing due to almost being 30
this lotion was not moisturizing enough to compensate for how dry the cleanser made my skin
i didnt moisturize my or show any difference.
way to harsh for a facial lotion
religiously used this lotion day
this moisturizer was ok.
but i did like the texture of the lotion
this lotion was causing my breakouts.
i stopped using the lotion
it does not moisturize skin
this moisturizer is light
this seems just like a toner to me
the only changes i have seen is with hydrating masks
because it is like a serum so theres extra moister
this basically functions as a mild toner before application of a face mask or other skincare
i am an avid facial mask user
i did like the sample of the moisturizing mask that came with it
found that a few sprays of this before applying a hydrating mask really helps the mask sink in
the instructions are for you to spritz
the same functions can be achieved with spritzing on any toner you have lying around
if you can replace the experience with a toner
which any hydrating toner will also do
my toner does the same thing
if you use hydrating masks
or skin laundry wash
in my opinion it's better than the fresh soy cleanser
to me it smells like flea shampoo
though it isn't quite a match for waterproof eyeliners or tubing mascaras
this facial cleaner works
only saving grace was that it mixes well with sea salt to exfoliate
i need a cleanser that helps moisturizing my face
i love their moisturizer
i will keep using my baby soap to remove all makeup
usually use fresh soy cleanser or philosophy purity
i wanted to like this cleanser
i only used the moisturizer under my eyes
am trying to find another cleanser
all my cleansers are creamy
i love oil cleansing
it works well as a makeup remover
i am still prone to hormonal breakouts with the product
one of their new face lotions
having used the old purifying cleanser for years
while i love the scent of the cleanser
i did not care for the texture of the cleanser
this didn't really help with my hormonal acne
wrinkles" as it claims to do
hydration for my skin
like my daytime moisturizer to balance me out
it moisturizes my skin at the first 10min
although i noticed it did smell a lot like sunscreen
the korres greek yoghurt sleeping facial
i think her hyperpigmentation managed to lighten up with the use of this oil
vitamin c is very good for your skin-
artificial fragrance that lingers the way actual fragrances do
i even tried it under other moisturizer
this was a recommended solution for hormonal acne by the sephora staff
the whole benefit of the 1000% vitamin c absorption
a beauty gurus mentioned using it for under eye wrinkles
step 1 isn't moisturizing at all
concealer pills on top of it
it's basically eye cream that's not even moisturizing
i tried it with 3 or 4 different concealers
if you wear concealer i wouldn't recommend
something about the other ingredients makes my powder foundation
not healing the dryness
this moisturizer is just ok.
which most moisturizers do
the slap some tinted moisturizer on in the am
i recommend using this moisturizer at night only before bed
never had this issue with my foundation while using cream moisturizers
"glues" makeup to your face- easily spreadable
they don't actually nourish the skin
i want my moisturizer to actually moisturize me
silicones also coat the skin with a barrier
i do not which is another reason for 2 stars the only thing i like is how moisturizing it is
that it's a light weight moisturizer for the face
doesnt moisturize or hydrate as much as youd think
it doesn't feel very moisturizing at all
i love this moisturizer.
it's very comparable to other high end gel moisturizers
this moisturizer definitely moisturizes
she raved that it was super moisturizing
not hydrating at all
not because it was actually moisturizing
it's the opposite of a moisturizer
this is my 2nd eye massager
this eye serum is difficult to use.
to massage the serum on to the eye area
i prefer an herbal or natural scent
ards for cleansing oils
exclusive ingredients in the rna creme that need protection from air
not unlike vitamin c which retrogrades when exposed to light
my skin drinks it in
because it is very moisturizing i have had two outbreaks
this product is a great face cream for its moisturizing
i used sk-ii prior to applying my daily moisturizer
directions says to rub the remaining serum in
there was no serum to rub
didn't notice any brightening effect from the enzymes
the serum is runny
no matter what concealer or setting powder i used :
then applying concealer my concealer completely breaks up
this eye gel just hydrates
its in fact just a simple moisturizing gel.
maybe hydrates more than a normal moisturizer
using the oatmeal mask
i think i'll stick with argan oil--no fragrance
with some exfoliant they went away
i don't recommend this to people with acne-prone skin
it also did not do anything for acne scarring or hyperpigmentation
i've had great results with retinol
glycolic acid for the fading of my acne scars
because i prefer lighter creams/serums during the day
the josie maran 100% argan oil
then layer moisturizers over it
this moisturizer is super thin.
not the least bit moisturizing
moisturizing thanks to the gel texture
chemically for the first minute or two
i get more softness from my regular philosophy night cream or an argan product
the fragrance/possibly the dye?
i reallyyyyy loved how moisturizing this is
the smell is kind of unpleasant like the "unscented" fragrance
two little pouches hydrate
for people who would want to use tinted moisturizer to simplify their makeup routine
you cannot apply this as a moisturizing because it's too shiny
i actually skipped my bronzer
i used this as a highlighter along with contouring
the formulation is a bit thicker
it was definitely moisturizing
i applied it one day as my moisturizer
i used this product as a moisturizer
the hydrating lotion in the bottle does hydrate my skin without being greasy
not enough coloring in the lotion
the hydrating lotion is one of my favorite products
only use a moisturizer with spf in the morning
it would be a bit redundant to put on even more hydrating lotion
i like mixing the lotion in with my foundation or bb cream
even though this moisturizer is advertised as lightweight
i like the moisturizing lotion
i'll just keep using sample packets of face glow to mix in with my lotion
this is just a milder type of cleanser.
aside from being a sunscreen
this isn't moisturizing enough
when i started to rub this moisturizer or put my makeup over it or a primer
i don't even find this to be very moisturizing
it felt moisturizing and smelled good.
it feels very moisturizing, but not greasy.
not before trying other hydrating creams first
can't use it in the morning under sunscreen with my usual routine
i typically like gel moisturizers
it feels way more moisturizing
for a moisturizer this expensive
i also purchased the rose foaming face cleanser to go with it
it did not work under my laura mercier tinted moisturizer
i absolutely loved their evening facial repair serum
i won't repurchase this moisturizer
i used other gel like moisturizer before
the serum claims to provide long-lasting hydration
while it did provide a good dose of hydration for my skin
i didn't find it to be superior to other hydration serums that i've tried
i've tried it with the c serum
have liked it--it's moisturizing
however, it is not moisturizing enough.
i am also a firm believer in combining vitamins c
b for ultimate brightening/hydration
i am still using de's vitamin c
this would be a good light moisturizer for oily skin
i like to use as an am moisturizer
i used this as my serum
also hydrate the dryness
i've used gel moisturizers i love
2 stars because it does hydrate my skin due to its gel like texture
it is not moisturizing enough to replace your daily moisturizer
i apply my serum
it has a gel texture
it will not replace your daily moisturizer
very sticky texture, not really moisturizing.
this product doesn't do any moisturizing whatsoever
this isn't moisturizing enough
even if i mix it with a moisturizing face oil
i try different moisturizers all of the time.
this moisturizer does the job for my combination skin
will look into other daily moisturizers.
this seemed like the type of thing my skin should love -- moisturizing
since it's a gel formula
i usually use jurlique night creams
got this bundled with the purity facial cleanser that i love
i wish it was unscented
why does any facial moisturizer have fragrance or dye in it?
although it is fairly moisturizing
yeast is an ingredient.
wanted a gel-cream day time moisturizer
i gave me a migraine.
i like the idea of cleansing
as it is a "cleansing mask"
even with my normal moisturizer afterwards
more like a foaming cleanser
use this over your concealer
which is the opposite of what you want in an eye cream/serum
my routine is to put on moisturizer
it doesn't matter if it's a moisturizer with or without a sunscreen
after checking the ingredients i saw alcohol denatured was the 2nd ingredient
this "golden krocus elixir serum" seals the deal.
the second ingredient after water is alcohol denatured
this serum did nothing for me.
mother perfume that was made into a serum all over
the smell of this serum is like strong
this serum smells nice
this serum is a pretty product.
if i am going to pay $100 for a serum
like vitamin c or aha serums
if it were unscented, i'd be all in.
followed by a new moisturizer
i can't tell if it's the serum or the moisturizer
i expected this serum to have some kind of effect on my skin
i wanted to love this serum
i usually apply it after my toner/essence
i put a few drops on my beauty blender to blend out my concealer
this serum smells exactly like old gr
i cannot believe how useless this serum was
this serum has so much glitter in it!
really for a skin serum
the serum itself is slightly sticky
i love the benefits of the vitamin c
it does seem to make me more reactive to some of my other exfoliating products
so be cautious if you use a chemical exfoliant of any kind
the zinc is great i just wish they would have used a milder cleansing agent
ruff shampoo to my sd spots while in the shower
especially since most pyrithione zinc shampoos contain fragrance as well
the mascara is subpar.
mascara was a throw in for about 50 cents
as for the mascara
the eyeliner is ok
it appears only waterproof liquid eyeliners work for me
the eye cream is moisturizing
the applicator is ok
the product is a nice night-time serum
i do like this moisturizer
light moisturizer for my oily skin
this cream is not a water cream.
lately it's been dehydrated from using retinol
it's not very moisturizing
the martian toner actually
i don't have an acne prone skin
my search for the perfect cream/gel moisturizer continues
not a fan of water creams or masks at all
this cream is a water based cream
i added a retinol to my nighttime routine which i love
still use the retinol i don't peel
i do love the lactic acid
it's not particularly moisturizing
it works well as a moisturizer
it is thicker and not as moisturizing.
this is a very strongly fragranced day cream with spf 20
very moisturizing for my chronically dry skin
this is not very moisturizing
i don't find this serum very moisturizing
i used as a moisturizer under my foundation.
why you would put pore clogging silicones in an acne treatment is beyond me
this cleanser made my face
whats the percent of glycolic???
hasn't been reformulated to this product
it reminds me of smashbox primers where its silicone based
my skin didn't feel moisturizer
i didn't see enough moisturizing benefits to keep this moisturizer
jart bb creams to sheer them out
it isn't super duper moisturizing though.
i like to use it between moisturizing /washing
which irritates my rosacea
it said use sparingly which i don't do with moisturizers
it didn't pack enough of a moisturizing punch for me
my skin could use a reapplication
it reminds me of a drink of water for the skin like a pre moisturizer or face mist
did not feel moisturizing.
then applied this moisturizer
i reapplied this moisturizer because my face felt like i hadn't applied a moisturizer at all
applied my usual moisturizer
ing how this is hydrating at all?
it's not that moisturizing
moisturizer or origins than this
this is so not moisturizing that it's insulting to moisturizers
i like this serum
it was recommended to buy as a day serum.
the serum felt nice upon application
it feels exactly like the other "hydrating" face lotion
hoped it was a breakthrough serum
especially since i enjoy the retinol fusion pm face serum
have been searching for my hg eye cream for under eye dryness that tends to be extremely accentuated by under eye concealer
the softening effect is done by the jojoba
you can get a cheap drugstore moisturizer with jojoba if you wanted to for $8
i think this was comparable to a drug store facial oil
might work for oiler/combo skin
creams i've placed on my face
not so moisturizing cousin
i never buy moisturizers
as i religiously use the algenist cleanser
to use after my night time moisturizer
as far as moisturizing
their moisturizing toner is fantastic
this product is not moisturizing nor hydrating for me
hydrating moisturizer with some extra benefits to put on over serums
this moisturizer has a stronger fragrance than other algenist products i've used
you will need a moisturizer
i like how hydrating
i love the natural ingredients
it doesn't moisturize at all.
a sales person at sephora recommended this eye balm due to my allergic reaction to many ingredients in eye creams
this is a cooling balm
after a nice cleanse/exfoliator i applied the jelly mask on
the product does an ok job of moisturizing
would recommend to someone with oily skin as a slightly cheaper alternative to more chemically based cleansers
currently under control thanks to my fave lancer glycolic treatment
making post-shower lotion an absolute necessity
doesn't really feel moisturizing
the moisturizer isn't all that either.
this serum did not do anything for my dark spots or acne scars
it was alright as a moisturizing serum
just feels like im applying another moisturizer to my face
i need a daily spf.
wanted to add an anti-aging moisturizer into my routine
i also love that is has no mineral oils or synthetic dyes
this cream is good combined with my josie maran argan oil
moisturizing without feeling heavy
it's rather strongly fragranced for a facial product
i don't normally like perfumey facial products
always follow with moisturizer
the hydrogenated oil in it is a strange ingredient choice
it seemed based on the thick texture that it would be moisturizing
doesn't soak in as most primers or moisturizers do
i've tried layering with moisturizers on top
also tried with moisturizer underneath
since it doesn't soak into my skin i leave it on my skin for at least 10 min or longer then i take the residue off with a moisturizing toner
it does help prime the face for my sunscreen/bb cream application
my skin requires hydration as i age
not recommended for ladies with dryer skin types.
i noticed this is the same thing with the same ingredients as my $10 toner
even my toner is cruelty-free
while it did moisturize
jojoba oil works way better!
i tried it a few ways--blended with moisturizer
used it with my moisturizer
paired with the cover fx mattifying primer
mixed with my moisturizer
mixing it with my moisturizer/foundation
this serum is nice
all this serum does is moisturize.
this is my first time using a serum
are all of his serums this small?
it is moisturize tho.
the cream had no moisturizing nor brightening properties
didn`t hydrate my skin at all
it is a good moisturizer.
gave this moisturizer a try for 1 week
this does have shea
baby facial for months now
i applied in the evening after the night serum
then tried a smaller amount in the morning after the vit c serum
massage it into my skin
it does moisturize my skin
there is no particular special benefit to my skin besides basic moisturizing
seems like a normal moisturizer to me
the cream is a good, reliable moisturizer.
except for this moisturizer
initially i really enjoyed this cream as it is very moisturizing
should not be advertized for oily/acne prone skin
the other from a moisturizer kit
i also don't really notice it being that moisturizing
this cream definitely hydrates
not even with the vitamin c serum
i won't purchase a moisturizer for $60.
this is just going to be a nighttime moisturizer
i tried adding the marula oil
without the serum this winter
the serum does nothing to improve the situation.
should just be called a cleanser
i tried using it as a moisturizer/primer
i paired this under powder.
i fell for the hype regarding glamglow illuminating moisturizer
when i think of a moisturizer
it really is an average moisturizer.
i would suggest getting the first aid beauty coconut priming moisturizer instead of this as 1: it is way cheaper 2: gives a nice glow 3: is way more moisturizing 4: also primes skin for makeup
it's kind of meh moisturizing-wise
i really love this moisturizer because i spray tan my body
this product is fibromyalgia
artificial fragrances are so bad for the skin
the fragrance of this moisturizer is yummy
this is different than other moisturizers
that it is a moisturizer
not to hydrate the skin
couldn't apply any of my eye moisturizers nothing
as i am a big advocate of tinted moisturizer on the regular
not very moisturizing just luminous
layered it with my usual daily moisturizer
some undereye concealer my skin looked seriously glowy
the packaging, scents, etc.
cons: the shimmer did not show through my concealer or setting powder
i love the idea of a moisturizer/primer combo.
i can apply my concealer on with no problems
then i tried mixing it with moisturizer
i love clinique's liquid face soap
it's an exfoliating scrub
went back to my clinique acne solutions cleanser
my so prefers physical exfoliation
i doubted this from the start since it's a physical exfoliant
you shouldn't exfoliate twice a day
it's still an exfoliator.
however i was really disappointed when it was no where near as exfoliating as clinique's exfoliating scrub
exfoliating as separate steps
not for major exfoliation, though.
i like the slight exfoliation
the new rose hydrating serum
toner are the winners from this line
50 cheaper than the moisturizers i'm referring to
secondly it wasn't moisturizing at all
i don't mean spf in your foundation or tinted moisturizer
when i tried to place sunscreen on top of this moisturizer
not as a moisturizer if you have dry skin i recommend to use another cream
but i would not recommend this as a moisturizer.
i wouldn't recommend it more than other moisturizers
if i'm wearing a moisturizer during the day i only use spf
while this cream was moisturizing
i like it as a morning moisturizer
i like the way the moisturizer feels on the skin.
it seems to make other products pill like a sweater in the region of my temples
good to put on after my moisturizer as a primer.
if i used another moisturizer with this
the clinique would pill up
i used it with it cosmetics cc cream which contains amazonian clay
using it as both the moisturizer
find a different moisturizing primer
need moisturizer on top of this.
the moisturizer has a feel that's like silicone
this product did the opposite of moisturizing
not moisturizing or mattyfing for me.
the redness soothing cleanser
redness solutions cream at night
i did not find it moisturizing at all
personally i don't find this moisturizer actually moisturizing
mix it with another moisturizer
i need to use my regular moisturizer with it.
i would rave about it's performance in either the moisturizing factor or the priming factor
i liked the texture of it although it didn't feel at all moisturizing
i liken this to those shampoo
conditioner in one products
wore it as a moisturizer with cc cream
i love the way my skin feels after applying the creme
this cannot be called a moisturizer.
how they market this as a moisturizer
it does not moisturize at all.
it is just moisturizing
i'd been using it as my moisturizer after a serum
i didn't see any real moisturizing effects or
i like gel moisturizers for daytime use to prevent extra shine from breaking through my makeup
i love this as a morning moisturizer.
less expensive moisturizers with collagen that i much prefer to this
it seems to do a good job moisturizing
because it reads more like a moisturizer/toner to me
my combo, acne prone skin will thank me.
not its moisturizing properties
i found the "perfect" moisturizer
this moisturizer does not hydrate your skin at all
i always have to add another moisturizer to it.
the product itself feels like any other gel moisturizer
gel in it i love
the formulation is okay
it does a good job of moisturizing
i would almost rater use a water gel peel
so that's why i was excited for the oil-free serum
i like the concept of tatcha offering a water/ gel type of moisturizer
applied my foundation with a beauty blender
i'd always have to follow it with a second exfoliator
i don't like exfoliating with something that contains harsh beads
this is a harsh cleanser.
i usually follow it up by moisturizing my face because it's a bit dry
you will need water & a washcloth.
smells like glue and acetone.
i ended up having to use an exfoliating cleanser to remove it
it did sting a healing acne spot when applying.
smells like vodka, second ingredient is alcohol.
denatured alcohol is the 2nd ingredient
it really is just another sunscreen for the face
as a toner it is ok
if this toner interests you
i get that with most cleansers i use
now i have to use just the cleanser as a liquid instead of foam
as i normally don't like foam cleansers
wanting something that was more moisturizing for the summer months
this is suppose to be hydrating because of the oils in the mask
nighttime moisturizer for over a month now
why do moisturizer manufacturers put scents in their moisturizers
i mixed with a moisturizer
i've purchased cheaper moisturizers from the drugstore that work better
face products should be unscented or at least lightly scented
i love how light the moisturizer is
i am liking the gel water moisturizers i have been using
this is poison for my skin
it is a good moisturizer
i needed to lather on a different moisturizer to make up for its dryness
took a break from this moisturizer
didn't foam for me at all or have any exfoliating properties
natural essential oils smell
i used after the genifique serum as suggested
as far as the moisturizing
the price is just out of this world for a lightweight moisturizer
this doesn't moisturize, period.
i like liquid moisturizers and serums.
thought it was a serum
did not feel moisturizing
i used it as serum with just a couple of drops underneath my moisturizer
this moisturizer is super lightweight
i still had to use a moisturizer after this
i like the feeling of this moisturizer
i enjoyed using this as a light moisturizer
ard moisturizer with a ton of alcohol added to thin out the texture
light moisturizer to throw in my bag for travel
worked well as a nighttime moisturizer
it's alcohol denatured is the 3rd ingredient in there
it comes across like its a cheap serum.
not only is this not moisturizing at all
i'd like to use this as a daily moisturizer
the formula contains no sunscreen
it literally died out my skin rather than moisturizing it
use it as a night moisturizer
i like that it's a serum
use it before creams
it would be good if you were looking to use this only as a sunscreen as it is lightweight
i wanted to use this as a moisturizer under my foundation
i previously used murad's mattifying moisturizer
this product claims to be mattifying
i wish they brought back their sister product the sephora collection: acne fighting mattifying moisturizer
i love the normal sephora moisturizer
not very moisturizing but the spf is a plus.
use this over my sephora instant moisturizer
has zero moisturizing power.
not moisturizing at all
it's more mattifying than moisturizing
a better description of the product would be a mattifying primer with sunscreen
sunscreen that was unfortunately discontinued
which i like as i find most sunscreens too oily
it tends to pill if you use a moisturizer underneath
for some reason i get a light redness from the cream
if i use this after my serum
if i use my serum
then a water base lotion
as i have combo skin
i need a moisturizer that actually moisturizes
moisturizer to complete my skin care routine
with moisturizer after cleansing my face
i cannot see this as a hydrating product
i do like other lancome cleansers
the gentle foaming cleanser w cottonseed from clarins
the cleanser itself is okay
heavy moisturizer that felt like a layer of product over my skin
love the firming moisturizing
it is not particularly moisturizing
i cannot see how a facial moisturizer with all that glitter can be of any benefit to me at all
it's not moisturizing at all
thick, heavy, not moisturizing.
not acne prone skin
this product contains nine comedogenic ingredients
the serum just sits on top
honestly the wining combo is toner
i'll review this again after i try it with martian toner
then in that same area my skin started peeling a little i tried moisturizing more
i am in love with the tidal moisturizer
this oil makes me want to wash my face with bleach
i recommend following it with something extra moisturizing
before this new "optimizer" serum
i don't need an entire pump of this serum
before it was reformulated
its not as moisturizing as i like my moisturizers to be
the scent was really strong that even if i applied my other facial moisturizing cream
it works more on illuminating than hydrating
i love the regenerating cleanser.
have to add my own moisturizer to it
which feels more gel than lotion
have been enjoying the restorative eye cream
all i can say is i did not feel any moisturizing effects from this cream
is this a highlighter or an eye cream?
there are some liquid highlighters
you have to use a silicone applicator
doesn't do anything for hyperpigmentation caused by rosacea
99 cleanser/scrub can do
it's just an okay serum.
especially applying at bedtime
i stopped using my korres black pine serum
the primer or the serum balls up
like the smell of this cleanser
i think a cleansing stick is more convenience to use than soap
toning i applied the mask to my face
i ended up using fresh's rose hydrating toner to calm my skin down which helped a little
my skin can be sensitive which is why i usually stick with renewing moisturizing masks
all the benefits from honey
honey helps draw out impurities
i buy manuka honey from bee keepers frequently
i've used raw honey as a cleanser
my acne didn't change after using this cleanser.
even with good diet
sulfur products usually work wonders on my acne
benzoyl peroxide works better for me
it helped reduced my hormonal breakouts overnight
it leaves a white cast like a sunscreen would.
another person who wasted 100 points thinking this was the original soy cleanser
i wasted 100 points thinking this was the original soy cleanser
which tends to happen with milky cleansers
the other soy cleaner
just by the other cleanser
this cleanser claims to remove makeup
i also told her i liked using a sample of fresh soy cleanser
the cleanser does a better job at removing mascara than the milk
while the product is very moisturizing
i love the soy fresh cleanser so thought i'd give this one a try
i've used their soy face cleanser for years
however this soy face cleansing milk does not wash off my makeup
i saw some reviews saying it's moisturizing
it was a layer of silicone
for this little bottle of serum
if they remade this with the fragrance they use in the essential c serum i am back immediately
the product is in a glass bottle
5 stars for the natural ingredients
it was a basic cleanser for me.
no amount of moisturizer could save it.
followed up with their age prevention moisturizer
this cleanser is a nice cleanser
i find this to be a drying cleanser
i switched back to my fresh soy face cleanser
i actually purchased this along with the serum
moisturizer from youth to the people
don't use any drying treatments
spinach in the ingredients
i find myself having to use this product at night after using a serum or with another moisturizer
stress/hormonal acne prone skin
this did not feel moisturizing at all on my oily skin
it's the most drying moisturizer i've ever used
i actually have to moisturize with another moisturizer within 1/2 hour of applying this
if you research ha doesn't work topically.
it is an okay moisturizer
it didn't moisturize at all.
it's really more like a gel/serum consistency
it hydrates the skin and that's it.
purchased this along with the serum
it did not feel moisturizing to my skin
i like to layer it under my day-time moisturizer with sunscreen or even under a heavier night cream
the moisturizer isn't hydrating enough
the ingredients in it
the ingredients are like a pressed juice for your skin
to be honest i didn't notice a difference using this serum
find other serum/essence
not a fan because of the drying feel of this serum
the cc cream is a lifesaver
after some research on the product i assumed this was a moisturizer cream type product
found it is a medium toned full coverage concealer
tan skin based on it cosmetic's cc cream
i've tried it after moisturizer and primer.
i really liked this serum.
the pump isn't sufficient to get to all the serum
my holy grail makeup remover
since i like oil-based makeup removers
nor is it unscented.
it wasn't waterproof mascara.
i prefer the ease of makeup towelettes to this product
i don't really notice any moisturizing benefits after i use this
looked at the ingredients only to find mineral oil
mineral oil and fragrance and alcohol.
i tried applying my foundation over this primer with a beauty sponge
at least a moisturizer that
i used it combined with the bye bye under eye concealer
i think all daytime creams should have spf already in them
i am searching for a good makeup remover
this is a moisturizer and that's all.
in the morning use kiehl's avocado eye cream in the morning which is also so much more hydrating than this eye cream
i love the undereye concealer
this product has many great ingredients that are very moisturizing for those with dry skin
for an eye cream at sephora
not as bad as the concealer creme
it cosmetics makes an eye pencil
i like the feel of this lotion
it does a nice job of moisturizing the eye area
all i use is moisturizer on my face
this cream is fantastic for moisturizing
if they ever make this unscented i'll have my hg cream
i like the cream
added it to my night routine as a moisturizer
too occlusive for my skin
the color correction jar during the day
good for bedtime use
went with the cream instead because it seemed more moisturizing
not as moisturizing as the yellow bottle
it wasn't super moisturizing
it didn't heal any of my hormonal acne
since i use an acne-treatment
i quite like the herbal scent.
when moisturizing usually clears the redness for me
$50+ just for sunscreen is silly.
i love the effectiveness of this cream at reducing redness
even after i moisturize
although this does have a physical sunscreen
i do find that i only need to wear concealer
then use a foundation or tinted moisturizer or something to cover
i don't find it particularly moisturizing
aside from occasional hormonal breakouts
hyper pigmentation that st
this product does help with redness
this product has a "sunscreen slip" feeling
even if you've already applied super duper creams/moisturizers
wanted to add something to my regimen with spf
this product takes care of my redness!
the only issue i have with this is it's too moisturizing for my combo/oily skin
i didn't find this particularly moisturizing
mild-rosacea-afflicted skin
the mineral sunscreen was also a plus.
firstly it has a medicinal smell
i don't have acne prone skin
end my skin take well this moisturizer look matte all day
it does work well with waterproof mascara though
emulsify the product before rinsing off with water
t doesn't rinse as clean as the clinique balm
drugstore one that i like so far is the simple hydrating oil cleansers
with balms on the other h
i think stick to the liquids
there's no mineral oil or artificial fragrance
the smell is herbal
i'll stick with the oil gel cleansers in this line instead
opted to order the erno laszlo detoxing oil cleanser that was a reward with the order
i never mind a second cleanse after a balm cleanse
it smells super clinical
it pills like crazy on my skin
no frills primer or lotion
i made the mistake of treating it like a daytime moisturizer
i typically use a retinol serum at night
i think it's fine as a non-comedogenic nighttime moisturizer
i don't feel it is amazing at moisturizing my skin
just not moisturizing enough.
the soft cream does not absorb well over serum or a lighter lotion
i think i'll stick to using the serum along with another moisturizer cream
it didn't hydrate my skin or lift
felt because i've had hormonal acne for my entire adult life
i seriously look like i used a crisco moisturizer
i need moisture for my combo skin
if i am paying over $70- for a moisturizer
although it was very moisturizing
is shea butter good for skin?
it has high amounts of vitamin e
is often used as a natural moisturizing agent for the skin
like a mini cold massage!
i also love her eradikate™ acne treatment
it did list alcohol which i am allergic to
this cream was super hydrating
used face finishing moisturizer during the day
smooth almost gel creme like
t is not very moisturizing considering it is a moisturizer
i like the lightweight oil cleanser aspect
mascara on a daily basis
almost like it was exfoliating my skin.
i followed it with the enzyme powder
not as hydrating as you would expect from washing with oil
the rice enzymes are a little drying for this canadian wonder
it's great for exfoliating
the rice powder does exfoliate
the rice powder exfoliate is a good compliment to the oil
i tried this cleanser
it's lightweight but still super moisturizing.
just like the coconut balm
i couldn't blend this moisturizer.
i couldn't blend this moisturizer.
it doesn't really feel moisturizing at all.
i do not recommend this moisturizer.
as if i had just put on white sunscreen
i love thick moisturizing creams
the moisturizing makes my skin so oily during the day
i prefers light weight cooling moisturizers
has a texture almost like an ointment
this is highly foaming liquid soap with oils added to it
sulfate with lots of fragrance
cannot tolerate foaming cleansers
remove my waterproof mascara
did not experience any allergic reactions or breakouts while using this product
when using the combination bar soap
i loved the cleansing oil
i still found make up residue when i used toner or cleansing water
just plain grapeseed oil
had to use another cleanser
the bar soap works fine
though i personally really dislike the bar soap format for facial cleansing
i like bar soaps for my body
for my facial skin care
patchy after i used it for 3 days rather than moisturizing it like it claimed
i do enjoy the cleansing oil
the serum is really a cute touch
it is moisturizing for sure.
it's really not doing much than moisturizing
i tried this eye cream hoping it would help moisturize my eye area as other reviews
this eye cream was just a glorified moisturizer to me
it is moisturizing and wears well under make up.
i like my cleansers to foam when i use my foreo
i expected a creamy cleanser that was hydrating based on previous reviews
i really didn't find it all that moisturizing
especially since i use retinol products.
it's not even that moisturizing is light
when you apply this moisturizer you can see the glitter in the skin
love the rainforest of the sea moisturizer
the moisturizer is not highlighting
works well as a moisturizer
it isn't moisturizing at all
it is a regular facial moisturizer with tons of glitter in it
not all over the face as a moisturizer
also not very moisturizing at all.
i love the moisturizing aspect of it
was not hydrating or moisturizing at all.
it did moisturizer my skin
this felt more like a primer than a moisturizer
it didn't moisturize my skin at all
the moisturizer comes off no problem
might even use it as a liquid highlighter
it was not moisturizing whatsoever
this "moisturizer" just has glitter in it
moisturizer with some microglitter in it
you may as well mix in some shimmer pigment with your moisturizer
it's not moisturizing and it's streaky too.
the dewy moisturizing look does not last all day.
while it does a nice job of moisturizing
i wanted to try a new illuminating moisturizer
this is microfine glitter in a lightweight moisturizer
i want people to know that this is a pink based moisturizer
bought their shimmer moisturizer
as far as a treatment or moisturizer- forget it
it was a good primer under my concealer though.
it held my concealer throughout the day
didnt find it hydrating or moisturizing at all
i think other brands have better eye creams.
my initial thoughts are that it's moisturizing
i wear eye cream daily
i love eye creams
it did a decent job moisturizing the area though.
i would say it does a good job of moisturizing dry skin
i received this eye balm complimentary of influenster
just use a hydrating cream before applying this balm
they say use white bottle as a moisturizing primer
this is a hydrating moisturizer.
i found for my combo skin
this stuff is neither firming nor moisturizing.
think is a good prevention serum
glucosamine is an interesting ingredient
maybe it works as a serum
this is not moisturizing, either.
not moisturizing at all.
i did not find this product moisturizing on its own
when i applied this serum
the serum is very light
the texture is like a gel consistency
i don't feel like this is a good moisturizer or could even be considered a serum
i actually really like this serum.
please make an unscented version because i'd love to keep using it
this serum-lotion goes on nicely
this product isn't really a moisturizer.
it has the consistency of a serum/primer
i either needed a serum under it or a moisturizer over it to feel like i was getting enough hydration
has that silicone/primer texture
i love this serum
on my skin i can only use the tiniest dab or it just balls up the moment i try to add other skincare or makeup over the serum
i've never had this problem with other vitamin c serums
this vitamin c serum
it is a good moisturizer
overall, i wanted to use this as a moisturizer.
i normally don't like lotion primers
i think the product works well as far as priming/moisturizing
it smells amazing and it's very moisturizing!
for my combination skin
i just want a good moisturizing primer
i love how this moisturizes the skin
a moisturizer are 2 different things
when my skin is dryer, i love this product.
then i applied this priming moisturizer instead of my usual moisturizer
after washing my face i applied my usual moisturizer
is not very moisturizing or noticeably brightening
fab extra repaire cream is my holy grail moisturizer of all times
i do love the luminosity this moisturizer gives
i'll be sticking to separate moisturizers
i like to use this product as a primer after i have already applied my daily moisturizer
after exfoliating my skin can get a bit flaky
i would recommend the coconut micellar for those with dry skin
i only wear sunscreen
i tried the rose cleansing milk because it's supposed to be moisturizing
this product did not remove my foundation or concealer
simple cleansing micellar water
i ordered the coconut cleanser just to give it a try
the smooth skin was partially from me using a exfoliating tool with yuzu
definitely don't get the exfoliating ones!
it's a non-foaming cleanser
while it did exfoliate some
this mask did exfoliate my skin
an exfoliator in the shower gives a better result
must be a placebo effect to the 5 star reviews.
i tried washing it off in the shower using purity
the serum since they broke me out
not hydrating at all
i also didn't find it very moisturizing
keep skin moisturizer throughout the day
i prefer my facial products to be unscented
purchased this thinking it would sooth that redness
i usually use the korres rose brightening serum
my makeup didn't pill.
i need a moisturizing lotion
while it was super moisturizing
the product is moisturizing
will "pill" with or without makeup
i even used the serum
the serum from the same line is nice though!
this was not moisturizing at all
for a hyaluronic it should give you some hydration
instead of moisturizing my skin it seemed to just make it oily
felt more like a primer than a moisturizer.
did not moisturize or hydrate my skin any better than the products i'm currently using
i didn't mind using it in conjunction with another moisturizer
why hyaluronic acid does nothing for me
this product isn't moisturizing enough for me
it wasn't moisturizing even though i have oily skin
has it helped my blackheads?
t's obvious after one day if a product works as a sunscreen or not
the cream/lotion version in the silver tube
try it after exfoliating my skin
i usually use nars vanilla concealer as a reference
would be an overnight detox
just go buy a moisturizer
while i liked the smell of this lotion
it could also have been the serum or lotion
the eye lotion has been ok
this moisturizer is so heavy
it just feels like plain sunscreen on my face
i feel like i'm smearing drug store sunscreen all over my face
too thick yet not moisturizing
low spf which smells strongly of sunscreen
bought this moisturizer because i needed something with an spf
it's heavier than the dramatically different moisturizing gel i was use to
this moisturizer feels much more like sunscreen --
this product feels more like sunscreen
this product is a sunscreen first
also kinda werid that i can actually smells the sunscreen
i've used clinique's other spf moisturizers before
none of them had a noticeable sunscreen scent like this one
i loved the hydroblur clinique moisturizer
the pep start eye serum
this smells so bad like sunscreen
such as polyvinyl alcohol
it didn't exfoliate for me.
not moisturizing at all
my skin does a lot better with lactic acid than it does with glycol
went back to using the glycolic acid
the de skin cream
i used 50% glycolic masks every other week
40% lactic acid peels on the weeks i don't use the glycolic ones
not moisturizing at all
the product is not hydrating
even after using a serum or skin oil underneath.
next time i'll choose something more moisturizing
she said this cream has a lot of synthetics
the product is a gel
it is not enough moisturizing for my super dry skin
it seems like an interesting moisturizer because of the half gel/ half cream
even after exfoliating my skin
i still dont find the moisturizing effect it claims after putting on the cream
however it is not moisturizing at all
cheaper moisturizers out there
its not hydrating at all
i've tried it over serum
it has a tea/herbal scent
i feel like the argan oil is more moisturizing
i typically use the argan oil light to moisturize my face
i will continue to use argan oil
i do use josie maran argan oil
i like that it is moisturizing
the argan eye cream then 5 drops of argan reserve face
girls buy argan milk instead.
my regular argan oil
spend the rest on a good retinol treatment or the argan milk
the moisturizer is good when its first applied
i didnt find any purpose of this moisturizer.
i don't mind the ceo serum
my skin is peeling from retinol that i currently use once in a while
plus the ceramic clay cleanser
the other being glossier priming moisturizer
i think vitamin c is better applied in a serum form rather than a moisturizer
i like to incorporate a product with vitamin c in it in my nightly routine
i wish it came in as a perfume or lotion.
i saw that it has hydrogenated vegetable oil in the ingredients
this is a heavy moisturizer.
my guess is that it has to do with the potent vitamin c inside the cream
adore vitamin c products
this may be because i layer it on top of my serum
better to just stick to a brightening serum a different moisturizer
when my skin has more of a chance to absorb the vitamin c
when i read the ingredient list i couldn't believe that this product actually has hydrogenated vegetable oil
just the vitamin c line
i love the packaging of this moisturizer.
this lotions smells great
which is generally the dead giveaway that your vitamin c cream has gone bad
while this is moisturizing
tidal is my favorite moisturizer
luna is my favorite retinoid
it's so heavy without being moisturizing.
i love the idea of vitamin c
i tried using it as my facial moisturizer
works great under makeup/sunscreen
i only wear tinted moisturizer
basic cleanser in my opinion.
em with the moisturizer
works like any other cleanser
typically use the fresh soy face cleanser
every time i use the soap
i tried rinsing the soap out with water to no avail
gross all in one facial cleanser
toner/fresh soy face cleanser
prefer a sulfate free cleanser that lathers
stick to another sulfate free
except for my stubborn waterproof mascara
i think this is a fine cleanser
i would not call it hydrating at all.
stopped using the cleanser
i needed a detox facial after using this for 3 days
my healthy diet hasn't changed
this is a rich highly moisturizing cream
it is suppised to be filled with sea plant based antioxidants
've tried a lot of moisturizers
with the helical based sunscreen
you get that chemical sunscreen smell
toning my facial skin
also the fragrance is too strong for a moisturizer
not as moisturizing or luxurious
even in combination with the la mer moisturizer
it is very moisturizing
a lot of eye creams do that
you can not use this facial cleansing foam on the eye area
this is very moisturizing so those with dry skin will like this
this contains some great emollients.
had to use another moisturizer
so far so good as a daytime serum
i've tried using it with a water-based moisturizer
i love the formulation
this is not a primer so don't expect a moisturizing product
this serum is good
the serum is light with a bit of a scent
this serum does blur the skin
this serum didnt fill in my pores like other smoothing primers do
when it comes to the mattifying effects
the product is a lighy pink serum it reminds me of a very light moisturizer
when i wear foundation over top of this serum it tends to pill
following it up with the squalene oil helped a bit
like most cream jars have
i will say it is hydrating
followed by firmness/puffiness
does not mix well with concealer
it is very moisturizing
it would still ball up under concealer regardless of the type of concealer or method of application
this cleanser removed all the makeup
have to use another cleanser afterwards
i'd say there's nothing special about this hydrating serum
you might as well buy a serum with a high percentage of hyaluronic acid in it
i didn't gain any moisturizing properties
have to use concealer under my eyes despite using this product
the sauna scrub from them is dope tho.
when i use the toner
i decided to give this cleanser a try along with the toner
t pores no more cleanser
i've tried a lot of different acne cleansers
i've used many cleansers specifically for oily or combo skin
along with the toner
it is a foaming cleanser
the ideal cleanser ph is 5
i enjoyed using the cleanser
intend to try the toner in this line
i will continue my search for the perfect moisturizer for my oily skin
can tell that this isn't moisturizing as well as i would need it to on the other parts of my face
for my combination skin
the search for the perfect combo skin moisturizer continues
i liked the texture of the moisturizer
while normally i like to use up moisturizers i've purchased
don't like how the toner or hydrator feel at all
helps with the acne.
i don't find that it is moisturizing enough for my combination skin
bc i already have cleansers
toners that i know work the best for my skin
i liked this moisturizer
a moisturizing face lotion because using this too many days in a row can lead to dry patches
toner from the find your balance line
peppermint scent as the toner
i found that the moisturizer was ok
this hydrator is lightweight
i used it with the cleanser
the texture is light weight like lotion
i do pair it with the cleanser
toner plus the grease relief facial water
my vitamin c is clear
i also think it was a great way for me to get into a vitamin c serum in a gentle way before going to a higher concentration
the product is hydrating
i can use my regular moisturizer for that
this cream gave me milia
this cream is hydrating
if they had this in unscented i would definately purchase
i get that it's a lotion
a moisturizer all in one
i love tinted moisturizers as i hate wearing heavy makeup
with the product description i expected a tinted moisturizer not a tinted sunscreen
i tried applying it in place of my normal moisturizer
in terms of healing acne scars
i've used about 5 serums for my fine lines.
even adding a vit c booster to this serum didn't help
i started with the resveratrol serum
not that i need an anti wrinkle serum
this serum is good
just felt like it needed a little more moisturizing power
indulging in this serum
also this serum made my h
very unpleasant experience all around with this serum
the serum itself wasn't bad
does a fair job of moisturizing
mild rosacea-having skin
provides a perfect canvas for concealer/any makeup application
mild rosacea-having skin
i can't complain about the serum
i wanted to like this serum
it is too oily to be a moisturizer or primer.
the plant extracts just ad fragrance
there are facial oils more moisturizing than this that won't make you break out
i can only use it by moisturizing first then applying it
then after i apply the rose gold elixir
however i will not be repurchasing this unicorn essence serum
i did love how the serum felt when applied on my skin
the serum is thick
as a serum i don't think it does much for my skin
i get a couple of hormonal pimples around my monthly
made my face too sticky to use as a serum.
going back to my normal serum
why a product at this price should contain dyes
for example grapefruit extract is photosensitizing
this "serum" is just gimmicky
this product uses ingredients that are known to cause cancers
way worse than vitamin c serums.
i loved the smell of the serum
mascara that i would go through a bottle in a week
will not remove eyeliner or mascara at all
this product is an effective makeup remover.
it's not terribly moisturizing
i love oil cleansers
this product seems to be the replacement for the oil-free daytime moisturizer
oil-free nighttime moisturizer that appear to be discontinued
not nearly as moisturizing as the discontinued products
this is a lightweight moisturizer
this moisturizer is very light
spf because i figured it was time to switch to a spf moisturizer
if i wanted to noticeably wear sunscreen on my face i'd just wear sunscreen
just the word "antioxidant" sounded awesome to me
now i'm trying to find another moisturizer.
other than that it was an ok sunscreen.
i'll use it for the spf
just can't be used as a daily moisturizer
feels too much like sunscreen than an everyday moisturizer
the one with spf 25
the spf 25 moisturizer was hydrating
i also loved that the spf 25 moisturizer provided protection
didn't feel like sunscreen
this primer claims to mattify the skin
i've used the hydra life pro youth sorbet creme for about 6-7 years now
i read reviews on the hydration sorbet creme
opening this jar was likeopening a bottle of cheap drgstore perfume
it felt like foaming cleanser from drug store.
i like foam cleansers
if you like a liquid to foam cleanser
this micellar cleanser does a good job of removing makeup
if you don't rinse it off after cleansing
it did exfoliate well
it did exfoliate my face
i don't need another 38 dollar exfoliation.
this was a great exfoliating mask
this is more of an oil than a serum.
on nights when i don't use this i usually use a balm to oil moisturizer
i really like the scent of this serum.
other reviewers say it removes waterproof mascara
this product is not moisturizing enough
this product isn't even really moisturizing
i love gel type formulas
the mask it self hydrating to earn three stars.
it's recommended to apply this gel
massage the left over ampoule into face
hydrates as much as a heavy lotion
this could be better if they contained more serum in the ampoule
f the formula in the ampoule contained more peptides
just stick to the normal dr jart hydrating sheet mask
this could be better if they contained more serum in the ampoule
f the formula in the ampoule contained more peptides
the moisturizer is lightweight
i try to keep my moisturizers as lightweight as possible
love the extra hydration
i used a lot of oil based moisturizers in the past
the water cream is a new addition to my regimen.
the water cream is an amazing moisturizer
reacted funny with my toner
although it is moisturizing
i'd recommend the clinique dramatically different moisturizer for oily skin
my usual daily moisturizer is elta md am therapy.
i wore only the moisturizer
it does do a good job of moisturizing
but it does not do any moisturizing whatsoever.
ferulic acid + retinol brightening solution
the colloidal sulfur mask
the matching serum helped moisturize
i received this as a deluxe sample hoping i'd find a nice vitamin c serum to add to my skin care regimen
i tried this serum
it definitely is moisturizing
the only downside is that it doesn't leave my face brightened like i hoped a product with vitamin c would
the vitamin c made my eyes burn so badly.
sticking to my makeup wipes/cleanser
the saving grace of this moisturizer was the baby-soft skin it gave me after using it
was not moisturizing enough at all
not moisturizing enough for me to wear it at night
however i was missing the eye serum
while i don’t think this serum made my lines worse
the serum is very watery
i don’t find that this serum adds any moisture to my eye area
i really liked the way the bottle dispensed the eye serum
i can't say this eye serum was life-changing like some other de products
i've tried many eye creams
the eye serum from my local sephora store
the sunscreen starting beading up
immediately after using the serum
i will not be repurchasing the eye serum
ruins the concealer application
my moisturizer didnt sink into my skin as well
wanted to live this product especially since i've been using the glycolic night serum
the beste cleanser isn't one of them
the cap is the same as the one on the umbria sunscreen
like my cleansers to smell good
this "jelly cleanser" has a texture that's like liquid soap
i think calling this a jelly cleanser is very misleading
this is supposed to be a makeup remover
i didn't find the beads to have any real exfoliating effect
this cleanser is a convenience item.
looks like dirty used deodorant
i mainly use this as a post workout cleanser followed by the matcha toner
i do love the matcha toner
i received this for a review with the toner
i tested it against other cleansers i use
i figured out that the moisturizer
the exfoliating mask is great
had to use another makeup remover to remove my mascara
i usually use the purifying cleansing gel with the konjac sponge in my night/morning routine
except for something to remove mascara
i love this cleanser
for a basic charcoal cleanse that's insane.
for a combination acne prone skin
i love their face mask an night mask esspecily in the blue or i believe light pink which ever is moisturizing
this ingredient comes after fragrance
that means you are getting more fragrance than sodium hyaluronate
i wish they had chosen to leave those ingredients out because then the fresh vitamin nectar moisture glow face cream does contain a lot of good for your skin ingredients
don't like the formulation.
the large grain is supposed to exfoliate my skin?
use the floral toner
this product was the only change in my skin care regimen
i need mega hydration in a night moisturizer/ mask serum to achieve glowy
the overnight mask contains artificial fragrance.
if you've ever used a glycolic acid facewash
i liked that this was a gel type cleanser
this serum is not hydrating at all
when i do apply the serum
while this is a hydrating
i wasn't expecting a miracle out of this serum
i do think that this serum is worth trying
the serum itself is just ok
i really wanted to like this serum
this serum / oil actually seems to dry my skin out a bit
not for acne prone skin
thought i'd try this serum
i like this serum
it is a light gel consistency.
it was a little moisturizing
this did moisturize my skin
anti-aging ingredients like polysaccharides
a more stable form of squalene
clinique moisture surge line plus pomifera oil as a serum
instead of a hydrating sleep mask
definitely not for daytime use either—it pills like crazy under sunscreen
it smells as strong as the perfume lotions.
the moisturizer was never absorbed
its extremely moisturizing and hydrating.
3 stars because it is hydrating
i developed some acne
it's a smaller version of their honey potion mask
even for a night moisturizer
as the ingredients suggest
overall its moisturizing capabilities is mediocre
toning i applied an even layer to my skin
i wouldn't say it was hydrating or moisturizing
this product does contain ingredients that can exfoliate dead skin
it was too orange to be bronzing
does smell a lot like sunscreen
i think a fair price for this small tube of tinted moisturizer would be $18
i would need to use concealer
it's working just fine with a lighter concealer
i did notice it did a great job moisturizing my skin
the serum is way too sticky
the serum has a nice
the only thing that i changed as a part of my daily habits was using this serum
i got to try a week's worth of this serum for free through influenster
i received a free 7 day supply of clarins double serum through influenster
the serum did add a good level of moisture
did not care for this serum at all
it was nice for moisturizing though.
while i did like the thickness of the serum
i think it did help moisturize
i received a 7 day trail from influenster of this serum in exchange for my honest review
the scent of this serum
turmeric was a big plus in the ingredients for me
i applied the serum
i felt like toner would have just removed the product
this serum is okay.
the scent of the serum was overwhelming
it actually worked more like a good moisturizer than an expensive serum
the turmeric part of the serum is staining
now doesn't include mineral oil in the ingredients
i don't know why a strong fragrance would be added to a serum
not easy to get the serum out
this is a good moisturizer
i expect this eye serum to contain a powerful active like retinol
which this serum definitely does not have
silky hydrating eye serum featuring hyaluronic acid
her retinol eye cream is way way better!
i did find this product to be hydrating.
it feels like gel serum consistency
i tried concealer with just this
at the age of 32 i don't need something that makes my hormonal/stressed induced acne worse
claims to be a "cooling gel"
it smells pretty bad for an expensive "natural" serum
this cleanser is unique in the fact that it foams without water
i like that it contains the emollient honey
i prefer my skin care products to be unscented
fragrance can be a skin irritant
this product did not moisturize my skin at all.
while it is moisturizing
not a jar for hygienic reasons
this is not the same as the blue herbal gel cleanser that came in the bigger plastic bottle
because when i used a toner
after using the toner
the matte after effect
if you don't use a toner afterwards
i don't use foundation or powders in the summer
then use this cleanser
i love a good chemical exfoliation or peel.
hormonal pop ups every now
i rotate my lactic
glycolic acid products depending on what my skin is telling me it needs
it pills up if i layer more than one other serum.
acne-prone adult skin
i ended up exchanging it for the vitamin c serum.
still on the hunt for the miracle serum
i went to put my oils/moisturizer on
followed with my moisturizer as the product directed
i needed a night time gel to help combat redness
my skin seems to drink up this cream
35-year-old skin with mild rosacea
it does moisturize the skin
it does an ok job of moisturizing my dry skin.
the cream comes in a jar.
the cream is hydrating
the vitamins in it probably degraded with use b/c of air exposure
his empower foaming milk cleanser
compared to other cleansers sephora had
i wanted a new cleanser
boscias black detox cleanser is the best i've found out of about a dozen
no needd for toner or rarely moisturizer with boscia
i always follow up w/ a toner after cleansing
my skin is combination
i've used it to spot treat hyper-pigmentation from acne
i'd rather use a more exfoliating product
non greasy this moisturizer is
i am migraine prone triggered by scents.
the scent hasn't bothered me as much as philosophy moisturizers do or even products with retinoids
if this were unscented
this is not moisturizing at all.
this moisturizer came in the $25 mini kit.
at first it was okay it wasn't super moisturizing
after 15 min if you rub your face it pills
i found this moisturizer to be so greasy!
it did moisturize my skin
when i tried to massage it into my skin
yeah it gives some moisturization
was hoping it would moisturize
1 hour after applying my mattifying primer
the 3rd ingredient is a silicone.
if you like thin moisturizers
did not moisturize my skin.
doesn't do much in way of moisturizing those areas
has the texture of mayonnaise
it is not hydrating or moisturizing enough at all
didn't moisturize me at all
my skin is combo
on top of that, it smells a bit chemically.
i like that this delivers vitamin c in a way that keeps it from being exposed to air
this serum smells great
layers well under moisturizer
after i put this on i use a good moisturizer.
dennis gross's ferulic serum for months
the only change in my regime was this serum
i applied a powder after
the smell of this serum is overwhelming.
it turns out that this serum contains multiple sensitizing ingredients
as the night gel
the texture is very sticky when you put this serum on
i used this serum everyday for 2 weeks after i showered
except for the occasional stress or menstrual pimple
i used truth serum for 3-4 weeks
decided to purchase the truth serum
it smelled pretty good compared to most vitamin c sedums
sodium ascorbyl phosphate is second on the list
the new bottles ingredients
i do not recommend this serum.
i wanted to love this serum so bad
the serum is sticky
it was actually the serum crumbling off my skin
most vitamin c's irritate my skin
when i apply this serum
the truth serum definitely has the "citrusy scent" as listed in the description
you can blend it out with a good moisturizer
i've just gotten an rx from my derm for a real vitamin c serum
the vitamin c is obviously key
this serum broke me out.
it was definitely the serum
i kept using this moisturizer
it turns out glyceryl stearate se is highly comedogenic
triticum vulgare germ oil is highly comedogenic
i ended up searching ingredients for a lot of moisturizers
overall, i like this moisturizer.
it also hasn't made me breakout which is great considering how moisturizing it is
i've tried many many moisturizers
it's not moisturizing at all
i wanted to love this moisturizer.
i switched to another moisturizer
i very moisturizing however when i rub it all over my face
the 3rd one is beeswax which is a non-breathable ingredient
any review that suggests using it as an under-makeup moisturizer
had an allergic reaction to it
the moisturizing wasn't as intensive as i thought it would be either
this is deeply moisturizing product.
apply another strongly scented moisturizer
i don't like this moisturizer at all.
this use to be the holy grail of moisturizers!!
not so moisturizing, feeling dry after.
i would love it as a night time moisturizer
it was very moisturizing
just your typical drug store moisturizer.
the product moisturizes my skin
what i don't like is that the product still contains parabens
you get a strong smell of bleach
a strange mix of herbal/chemicals.
it also doesn't moisturize my skin.
hydrating on my skin
i wanted to try a new moisturizer because the br
i mix it with other moisturizers or oils to help with the smell
it doesn't moisturize well.
hope in a jar is a basic moisturizer
love the fact that my skin absorbs the moisturizer on contact
it hydrates my skin well.
this is too light-weight for a moisturizer for me
the moisturizer is great in that it is moisturizing
i found this product was not worth the hype--definitely moisturizing
my skin is combination
it did not do a great job moisturizing for me
this lotion was the only new addition to my regimen
it's an ok moisturizer.
my eyes kept watering while i put on the moisturizer
it has very little emollients
moisturizers that also have spf
many people recommended to use this moisturizer
it just wasn't moisturizing enough for me in the winter
why the company would include lavender oil in a face cream
it does not moisturize the same
given me gross dry patches that no amount of moisturizer or facial oils can seem to fix
it hasn't helped my acne
after 4 weeks of use:i'm 30 with some mild hormonal acne from time to time
ptr retinol serum was a bit drying
the retinol isn't abrasive or drying for me at all
all i received was an extra dose of acne
skin firmness or any other known effects that retinol has
i don't have a retinol allergy....
i think this product contains 1% formulation which is mid-strength for over the counter retinol
i like this product for its moisturizing properties for my oily skin
feels hydrating when first applied
it's not moisturizing enough for me
i dont think its hydrating
it barely felt moisturizing
buying the only thing that ever worked for me: murad vitamin c undereye cream with spf 15
this eye gel hydrates the eye area well.
i put this gel in the fridge
works well under concealer during the day
my search for the holy grail eye cream/gel continues
the truth is the creams from my dermatologist did a much better job of clearing my acne
wouldn't recommend this as a way to treat acne
i got this with a 3 piece gift set which included the grape water spray the quenching serum
this lotion is just that.
does a decent job of moisturizing
i tried this lotion for months
i've tried other moisturizers that do give you a glow
a light gel-cream texture
this moisturizer gives me pimples.
moisturizing toner so wanted to have a moisturizer in the same br
i don't think i'll buy the moisturizing cream again
moisturizing when you apply it
lotion/milk textured based product
i find that i still always have mascara in my eyelashes
you'll need something more exfoliating
i need to use another cleanser to wash off the oiliness
or acne-prone skin
as with the cleansing water
i found this product to be more of a moisturizer than a cleanser
i used it as a cleanser
applying my normal moisturizer after
as it is more like a lotion than a cleanser
i loved the foam cleanser yet decided to try the clean sling milk as i have aging skin
almost like an allergic reaction
why make a cleanser that doesn't cleanse?
that's what moisturizer is for
when i used this cleanser
take a bottle of regular body lotion
when i use caudalie's cleansing water afterwards
they have "reformulated" it
this left a residue like old deodorant
caudalie used to produce another gentle cleanser.
may still use the lotion
i cannot use this cleanser
i immediately re-washed my face with an exfoliant to get it off
this cleanser has a new formula which left a greasy
the cleanser feels like wax when applying on my face
love caudalie's lotions, but not this cleanser.
cleanser in one to use at night
i wear clinique superbalanced liquid makeup.
i usually use witch hazel as a toner after washing to make sure i get everything off
this gel can't move my mascara off.
which is the bareminerals tinted moisturizer with a little bit of concealer for hyperpigmentation
i like this cleanser
i don't think the facial cleanser itself is breaking me out
was my hg cleanser
so when my soy cleanser ran out
this is a good cleanser to remove makeup
i knew topical gel moisturizers were drying
purchased this item for my acne scars
this treatment is gentle unlike some other spot treatments
i do like the applicator
returned the murad acne spot treatment
i wish the applicator was a bit more hygienic
this treatment didn't help my acne.
i like how moisturizing it is however it hasn't done anything for my dark circles or wrinkles
i put three stars because i like how moisturizing it is which is great for my concealer
one star because it's moisturizing
boscia's eye treatment is hydrating
i find it moisturizing
it helped moisturize my eye area
not as moisturizing as i would like.
i don't really think it does much aside from moisturizing the skin under your eyes
i think this cream can be used as a prevention since it's hydrating
it isn't moisturizing enough
this product is great for moisturizing
it's a good evening moisturizer in terms of hydration
that's about it smells like sunscreen
this cream is lightweight and moisturizing.
my skin didn't like it as a daily moisturizer
was in the market for a new moisturizer
smell reminded me of sunscreen
within a day i could see the effects of the vitamin c
it just wasn't moisturizing enough even for daytime use
i recommend the sleeping facial
it feels like a drugstore night cream
this cream was great at moisturizing my face by the smell is soooooooo strong
i don't mind fragranced items
get the yogurt cream
i love the smell of this moisturizer
this lotion is not as good as the sleeping facial in terms of reducing redness
something really moisturizing for the upcoming cold season
this moisturizer is ok... nothing special.
i tried other korres night creams
i do recommend the night cream
i recommend it for washing your brushes
i like this cleanser a lot
i try to avoid parabens in my makeup
saw that it contains parabens
would make products that contain parabens
this cleanser left my skin dehydrated
my skin was dry in a scaly way that exfoliating
i normally use facial cleansers sold in drug store/ supermarket
it doesn't take off liquid lipstick as it is a water based cleanser
moisturizer is a must after this
parabens are bad news.
parabens are of similar concern
more like harsh dishwashing liquid
but it is a good makeup remover.
i love this cleanser
so over this cleanser.
whiteheads all came out after using this cleanser
i like the concept of a one step cleanser
using different moisturizers that i have loved
the smell of this cleanser is off.
bought this product in an acne cleansing kit
i loved the acne treatment gel
the gel cleanser was terrible
all i wear is tinted moisturizer
i prefer a time-saving cleanser
i like the murad time-release acne cleanser better
they recommended me bliss for acne
i stopped using the cleanser
bought this cleanser to try to combat the redness in my face
after i started using the murad redness cleanser
i need at least 15% vitamin c
it actually smells like vitamin a should smell
it does not moisturize
i expected more for the cost of having only vitamin a
it works well with the vitamin c syrum.
he says its a light moisturizer
exfoliate my face prior to applying
it feels more like a moisturizer
is seems more like a moisturizer then a pore minimizer
most pore serums are formulated for people with oily skin
i wouldn't recommend it for adult acne
i am allergic to perfumes
this is "unscented" so maybe its just the ingredients that are like a strong detergent
there is some kind of whitening effect
i much prefer gel-based formulas
this is just too moisturizing
use clinique redness cream instead.
plus it has parabens.
i give it two stars because the packaging was made for us germ conscious people
it doesn't moisturize like a moisturizer should
said it helps with hormonal breakouts
a long time sufferer of rosacea
i don't have rosacea
my derm told me that the only treatment for my rosacea was laser therapy
i don't have rosacea
not intended for redness removal from rosacea
it does little to help with any redness or rosacea
this has helped my rosacea
need to use another moisturizer on top
since clinique redness solutions daily relief cream quit working for me
i don't have rosacea
it hydrates under my concealer
i don't know if i am allergic to any of the ingredients of this cream
it seems to moisturize my eye area.
i'll be using the exfoliant from here on out.
i prefer using powdered clay
mixing with apple cider vinegar
love this as a daily cleanser and/or mask.
purchased for my body acne.
this product is a mask,not a bar of soap.
i used this in combination with the moisturizer
perhaps it is the soy mixture or something
this cleanser does the job
not foamy or exfoliating.
don't like the consistency of this cleanser
it's moisturing，and the texture just like serum.
note: i have combination skin
since the formula is a gel
*gentle* cleanser for days off makeup
i always use the purity cleanser
had a sample of the fresh soy cleanser
expect no miracles: it is only a degreasing clay
i've used many other exfoliating scrubs before
the only con in my opinion is the artificial coloring
it leaves mascara and eyeliner behind.
i ended up using it as a 2nd cleanser after cleansing oils
this cleanser claims to remove makeup
it feels more like a lotion than a cleanser
use a tonic water thing to remove all the makeup after cleansing
irritated by most cleansers that are not milk or oil formula
this cleansing milk does clean
it is moisturizing and gentle.
i decided to try clarins' cleansing milk with alpine herbs
the cleanser almost feels like a cleaning oil
this cleanser smears any remaining mascara all over my face
this isn't the normal cream cleanser where you massage into dry skin
it didnt work as well as other cream cleaners as far as getting rid of sunscreen
i figured i would be amazed by a mattifying moisturizer this expensive
cheap sunscreen on my face
i can't speak for the moisturizing properties of this product
blend with this moisturizer on your face
i tried also using my beauty blender
i like water creams better.
like to use a moisturizer for that reason
i like to use this product as a nighttime moisturizer because it does work
i even use 2 different powders
this is okay as a nighttime moisturizer
i want the mattifying properties
the moisturizing properties are not there
it sits on top of your skin without moisturizing
it's not a mattifying moisturizer
use a gel moisturizer instead
invest in a nice gel moisturizer
i didn't like this moisturizer.
i prefer facial moisturizer without fragrance
tried this moisturizer out
it claims to be matte???
i prefer gel-type moisturizers
i think it was the dimethicone
i would call this more of a solid perfume than a moisturizer
voila there it was: perfume in a moisturizer
it's super sticky not even moisturizing or matte
more of a balm than a moisturizer, just fyi.
didn't see many hydrating results
i loved the moisturizing sorbet that paired with this serum
after i wash the serum off my face
it seems like the serum acts as a topical diffuser
the serum is super hydrating
otherwise, it's a nice serum.
even with the moisturizing sorbet
please be aware of this before you use the serum
i received a sample for my birthday along with a moisturizing sorbet
pure olive derived squalane can be found online for half this price
it felt nice going on after my toner as a serum since it was very moisturizing
a little goes a long way with this serum
then applied the serum before bed
i still want to try the vinosource moisturizing sorbet
as you would a moisturizer
for it isn't super spreadable
was hoping this serum would as well
i hoped to see a difference with regular use of this serum
avene micellar lotion to clean my makeup before i use this
i needed to load on the moisturizer
the double serum?i want to know how it works
if you are deciding between the cottonseed cleanser
the gel is light
soothing when i apply the gel on my eyes
dose not work as it says
after reading the customer reviews for the eye contour gel
it moisturizers, but no miracles take place.
forget about "super restorative effect"
although this eye cream is a good moisturizer
smells like cheap shampoo
does work well with concealer
i can find hydrating
moisturizing creams for cheaper than $83
i found the cream made the skin around my eyes red perhaps i was allergic to some of the ingredients
it was not especially moisturizing
not really that moisturizing
another user mentioned that this pills on dry skin
i don't wear foundation or concealer on top of this
usually i use this after my final moisturizing step
it sure was moisturizing
i am prone to migraines
not very moisturizing, not 'brightening'.
yes it does moisturize
then moisturize with something that is smoothing
using a moisturizer with an spf in the morning
a denser hydrating cream at night
this cleanser works as good as any cleanser
the moisturizing cream works great
i returned this cleanser.
this cleanser work well
maybe i should be using this in a combination with a hyaluronic acid serum or something
this wasn't moisturizing enough for my face
had to use another moisturizer
i can just use my regular moisturizer
it does have a mattifying effect on your skin
followed it with a light moisturizer
i couldent put a moisturizer over it
get the bliss youth as we know it serum to use at night
enables me to use powdered
it did nothing to help with my blackheads or acne
the lotion had an okay texture
compared to the greek yoghurt moisturizer or sleeping facial
i am sticking to good old aloe next time!
used it after a sunburn
not unlike the feel of aloe vera gel
smells like baby lotion
its greasy and doesn't nourish the skin at all.
i also wish it was less fragranced.
i wanted a moisturizing night cream for the start of the winter months
i found it not as hydrating as claimed
or natural aloe vera or herbal fruits masks or drinking more water was reducing the dryness
heavy fragrance and not heavy moisturizing
i wouldn't spend my money on this moisturizer
is very good at moisturizing
i found it sort of greasy like suntan lotion
overall it does moisturize
have to use a very drying medicated cream at night
needed a moisturizer to make my skin normal again
will continue using until it finishes because it feels so moisturizing
it felt like it was moisturizing when i put it on at night
i am using murad anti-aging/acne reducing cleanser
the perfecting day lotion as my routine
now i use oil-free moisturizers
this moisturizer is a great hydrator for nighttime use especially in the winter time
tried for a week after my serum in the morning
liked that it had vitamin c
i returned this for a different sunscreen moisturizer
i found myself reaching for my retouching powder before lunchtime
i cleanse my face then tone and moisturize.
tend to not be harsh about moisturizers
this "moisturizer" is just not
don't know what dose my skin received
it did not have the same lovely scent or feel as some of the other vitamin c products
this moisturizer has water listed as one of the first few ingredients
this moisturizer is not great for oily/combination skin
the moisturizer smells good
a really overpowering sunscreen smell
i'll be trying out other murad sunscreen options.
i noticed it had the consistency of heavy sunscreen
pigment lightening serum a few weeks ago
it was too much like a sunscreen
i enjoy using sephora's mattifying spf 20 moisturizer
this is a light weight moisturizer with vitamin-c
this product was formulated for tropical areas or areas when the uv beams are high
it also smells strongly of sunscreen
vitamin c is supposed to be great for the skin
it has no moisturizing benefits at all.
moisturizing daytime lotion that is botanically based
to find lotion without it
back to the drawing board for something more moisturizing
it has vitamin c to keep skin bright and spf 30.
murad has taken the titanium dioxide sunscreen out
replaced it with oxybenzone
the thought process of whoever decided it was a good idea for facial moisturizers to have a strong fragrance
while it is paraben-free
will try the ligthening serum again tho at night time
i loved this moisturizer at first
it has a slightly detectable sunscreen smell under the orange fragrance
i prefer the other murad cleanser.
i went to oil cleansing method
to fix i should use this cleanser
i honestly cannot tell the difference between this vitamin c cleanser
i used the essential c serum sample and loved it.
this cleanser had glitter (?)
this cleanser is okay
i do like the exfoliating beads.
i do like it as a hand / body lotion.
thought this moisturizer would help
liquid foundation or cream foundation
while i love the moisture this lotion provides
i agreed to try this cream after asking an associate about a moisturizing
it seemed drying rather than moisturizing
bobbi brown tinted moisturizing balm
as described it's a very moisturizing eye cream
this is an eye cream.
it may help with puffiness
the cream moisturizes well
i enjoy the body scrub and the lotion for kp.
it interfered with the concealer application
used as derma rep said
drying product no sign of being a balm or moisturizing
this product was moisturizing
i rarely use eye creams.
reassurance that it's moisturizing etc
it is very moisturizing so there's that
there is retinol in it
it wasn't moisturizing enough for my eye area
she does not use products with parabens
the ingredients include both methylparaben
it's quite emollient to the skin
am accustomed to therapeutic stinging
no moisturizing properties at all.
i like the cream itself
isn't a strong enough exfoliation that i can skin a more granulated scrub
with enzyme in the name
s pumpkin enzyme masks
which stings when i put on lotion
sephora staff said this would be a great exfoliant for someone with sensitive skin
this is like putting aloe on your face
only the aloe is less expensive
it is made of aloe
just an average aloe which you can buy at store at a fraction of the price of this mask
it is moisturizing for a bit
it proved to be just another moisturizing cream
i don't notice any difference in its moisturizing or wrinkle reducing ability compared to lesser priced competitors
not sure moisturizing as the sephora rep said
texture matched the facial cream
for an eye crème.
i used it with the retinol night ointment
not hydrating at all
feels like i am putting drug store body lotion under eyes
i like the way this eye cream blends into my skin
this could be a good preventative wrinkle cream
slightly thicker than a serum
what i received was a face-cream jar filled with a pourable lotion
as it's more of a lotion
not at all hydrating
this product is immediately hydrating
bought this moisturizer after having a wonderful experience with the korres yogurt night cream
when i switched to a different moisturizer
on my usually acne-free skin
moisturizer in the store
idea of yoghurt for my face
i love the greek yoghurt facial mask
this moisturizer balls up
it was moisturizing without being greasy
she recommended the korres greek yogurt sleeping facial
the moisturizer has a very strong yogurt-y smell
however for any facial products i prefer non scented products
it felt a little gooey although moisturizing afterwards
than move onto applying my oil-free sunscreen
this had been the only lotion/moisturizer that i have used that removes fine lines
i've spent 160 a jar on creams
ask about the moisturizers that i picked online
this moisturizer works wonder for her
is not moisturizing at all
i ended up choosing this facial moisturizer
time to look for another moisturizer...
so you think it would be moisturizing
i've tried a lot of face creams
a sales associate introduced me to this one after taking some sort of moisturizing match questionnaire
the moisturizer is "very drying"
this moisturizer offers instant
this product is where i would set the bar for my moisturizers
i found this moisturizer okay
d recommend this to anyone who is ok with scents in their facial products
it's a good eye moisturizer
i usually use pure argan oil as my night time moisturizer
the third ingredient is mineral oil!!
petrolatum are petro-chemicals that are cheap to produce
are occlusive in nature
not soothing or moisturizing
this cream was not emollient
had an allergic reaction to this product.
when i put concealer over it
it made the concealer crease
moisturizing cream to help diminish the look of fine lines
moisturizing is the key word
because it moisturizes the area
they have the peptides that help produce collagen to " fill in " the fine lines
they also contain a " retinol " to help exfoliate
they also moisturize to help with dark circles
go with the lotion
i recently bought his maximum moisture treatment lotion
the soap cleanses well
this soap cleans fine
i usually buy the liquid facial soap
the acne solutions actually seemed to combat "redness"
i prefer bar soaps to liquid face wash
i do wear contact lenses
i usually use the no 3 liquid cleanser
decided to try the soap
a little extra moisturizer helped
my plan is to get the moisturizer from this line
all this hype about this facial soap
with the hope that he would stop using my dramatically different moisturizing gel
he said it didn't seem moisturizing
this moisturizer has a mineral oil
use a moisturizer that does not contain mineral oils
i feel the product still moisturizing my eyes
the wrinkle eye cream
it's not very moisturizing
hydrating around the eye
is very moisturizing though
it's moisturizing, so i gave it an average.
moisturizing without being heavy
more like anti moisturizing.
it did moisturize a bit
hydrates but that's about it.
i think we both prefer exfoliators with scrub beads
isn't this just a toner?
my makeup routine is just tinted moisturizer
this cleanser stripped my skin of all moisture.
searching for a new cleanser
i switched to the exfoliating pep start fave scrub
this cleanser strips my skin of all oil
my toner pad would be covered in foundation
i struggle with hormonal acne
i tried this as an alternative to a harsh acne cleanser
this cleanser was effective at taking of makeup
i tried this cleanser one time
it felt really moisturizing at first
if you just want a not too pricey eye cream that does basic moisturizing
tried all the eye creams from clinique because my mom raves about it
i've used other creams before that truly felt moisturizing
treatment for puffiness this is for you
i can use cheaper cream to moisturizer my eye's skin
it is very moisturizing.
does moisturizer the area well
i do like the hydration
i want benefits i'm not getting with my facial moisturizer
was not moisturizing enough.
s of eye creams over the years
i found that it did a good job of moisturizing the area
i found it to be far less effective/moisturizing.
has little moisturizing effect
although its a thicker consistency than the gel lotion
my huby prefered the clinique moister surge gel
nothing special about the moisturizing ability.
i used this moisturizer before
this is a good moisturizer
i believe the lotion is better for dryer skin styles
there are many other matte moisturizers that work better
all this and it's very moisturizing as well.
the first time i used this moisturizing gel i loved it
go for the clinique moisturizing cream over the gel formula
i liked this moisturizer
i prefer the lotion
i've used this moisturizer for combination skin since i was a teenager
the instructions of the moisturizer say to dispense 1-2 pumps
so does the toner
i've found a better moisturizer for my skin
i prefer most drugstore moisturizers to this.
my skin flakes with this moisturizing gel.
i do enjoy the vitamin nector mask
love the rose toner from fresh
considering one of the contents is aloe vera.
the product label says it will hydrate and tone.
at times i use it as it is a pleasant placebo of taking care of myself
it has a hydrating gel consistency
it was not moisturizing enough for my dry/combo skin
i really like the bienfait moisturizer
the sunscreen effect is basically non-existent.
i wanted to purchase a product with spf that also helps with hydrating myskin from the dryness due to chlorine
it had a faint smell of sunscreen
i tend to have a problem with the ingredients used in physical sunscreen
white paste left after application confirms that this product has the properties of physical sunscreen imo
that made my skin itch in outdoor activities
this lotion didn't cause breakouts
this moisturizer hydrates well without being greasy
this spf lotion was not compatiable with my skin.
even though i use it after applying a toner
i used an spf 40 sunscreen protection over this moisturizer being that i live in sunny california
the makeup artist removed the foundation on my skin then applied this moisturizer before applying the nars sheerglow
i needed a moisturizer that was light
i'll probably return this lotion for the bienfait day cream
guessing it's the glycolic acid?
i would never describe this as exfoliating.
though it takes mascara off my lashes
especially my waterproof eyeliner
the first ingredient is ethylhexyl palmitate which is highly comedogenic
my waterproof eyeliner was still on
use another cleanser afterwards
the toner on a cotton ball i use from another major cosmetic company showed that the foundation
you also have to rub to get waterproof mascara off
have been very please with the vitamin c cleanser
i don't think it was the vitamin c as i have used other products with vitamin c on my entire face
this eye cream has dimethicone
i like using my mineral powder based sunscreen made exclusively for the eye area because i can reapply throughout the day
even over my undereye concealer
there are few eye creams with spf in them
years ago i used the aha/bha exfoliating cleanser
i like this eye cream.
this is a so-so moisturizer
it is a hydrating cream, though.
i loved it because it had the vitamin c
i like my daytime eye cream to contain spf
the vitamin c rationale sounded good
am careful about using sunblock in everything
t does nothing in the way of moisturizing
it also isn't moisturizing at all.
i knew i was taking a chance purchasing his vitamin c eye cream without trying it first
i havbe tried dozens of eye creams
it wasn't moisturizing enough for me
i just recently learned that foaming cleansers are best for oily skin
i don't even really feel that it is moisturizing
the instant detox mask
i like this cleanser a lot.
may be some foundations or bb creams.
i typically like exfoliating washes
but this cleanser makes my skin irritate.
thought this would make a great anti-aging cleanser
you can use it as an additional cleanser after your makeup remover
if it were a bit more exfoliating
i typically use fresh soy cleanser and i love it.
nothing special as a cleanser
unlike many other foaming cleansers i've used
love the caudelie cleansing water
no special ingredients are really in this cleanser
first aid beauty antioxidant cleanser is the way to go for me
it feels like your washing your face with hair conditioner
it smells like chlorine
continued with the cleanser
sunscreen using this cleanser
i tried the system so the cleanser along with the toner
i used this cleanser with my clarisonic daily
i've tried a few of the clinique cleansers now
i don't recommend this face wash liquid soap
firstly, it has a very chemically smell.
without any acne fighting ingredients
soap for your face
i tried this cleanser in a set
not good for exfoliating
clinique's foaming sonic facial soap does a much better job
then i also like to use an exfoliating scrub at night
it took me about 3 nights of heavy hydrating with josie's argan oil
this formulation was intended for dry combo skin
get skin pen treatments from your dermatologist
i do exfoliating my face once a week
balls up with certain moisturizers
this product was not moisturizing enough for my under eye area
i really can't get over the medicinal smell of this product
so moisturizers are hard for me.
based on the fact that this bottle only contains 1 oz of lotion
this is the only product i can find with a chelating effect
this is a very light moisturizer.
it seems to be not very moisturizing
0 oz in the packaging
this is a good moisturizer
i've used drug store moisturizers with those same qualities
this is a basic light moisturizer with no scent
i can use toner right after
it does not cleanse skin
i'll probably try the milky to foaming cleanser
not a great mascara remover
i usually just use a tinted moisturizer
this product helped moisturize my skin
when i used a toner after cleansing i could see all kinds of dirt coming off my skin
as well as the toner
i normally do not care for creme cleansers
the serum hasn't changed them at all
this did not help my fine lines or acne scars/hyperpigmentation
this does feel very moisturizing
was excited to try this serum
even right after applying toner
was excited to try their vitamin c serum
the korres is not as moisturizing
the consistency of the korres serum is a little thicker
as soon as my regular serum arrives
i typically use fragranced products on my face
i like the overnight rose sleep facial cream better
initially i loved this serum.
when i tried the serum
with all of the antioxidants
the serum felt good
i've used the serum for about 2 weeks
a serum is not a prevention product.
i will say however that it does a nice job of moisturizing in the summer
i used korres wild rose brightening serum for a couple months
this serum broke me out.
this serum does lighten pigmentations
around the areas where i applied the serum
i've used the serum off
it feels like sunscreen 2
it has a very strong sunscreen smell.
it smell like sunscreen lotion
it smells more like perfume than moisturizer
as i have acne
this product is mattifying
it is real waxy, not moisturizing.
it will moisturize it in winter time
it did a great job moisturizing in the winter
this moisturizer balls up
this sunscreen was a little too greasey for my face
for the price i would like a little more moisturizing benefits
not moisturizing at all.
i always wear waterproof mascara
while this does moisturize my skin
i love the cleansing balm from clinique
had little to no effect on my mascaras
the back of the product states you can apply dry with a tissue as a makeup remover or with water like a cleanser
i only use this as a cleanser
i'lll just stick to their normal facial cleanser.
this cleansing milk just dissolve everything.
after using this cleansing milk
purity cleanser to actually get my makeup off
balm from this makeup removing range
it's moisturizing so that may be a plus for some people
this makeup remover is not for the eye area.
i love clinique's take the day off cleansing balm
decided to try the cleansing milk
a shampoo/soap that get in my eyes from time to time hurt less
a facial cleanser does better job than this.
usually just some under eye concealer
let alone the non-waterproof mascara
this is not an eye makeup remover!!
you will need a couple cotton squares worth of toner to finish the job
i always wash off with a cleanser after
clinique take the day off cleansing balm
or other oil cleansers
it doesn't work well as a facial cleanser either.
it is not a cleanser.
despite two thorough washings with the product
mascara all over my face
i will stick with the rinse off eye makeup solvent for removing my mascara
i like the liquid facial soap much better.
as far as eyeshadow
mascara/waterproof mascara go
this product is really more of a sunscreen.
lightweight moisturizer/sunscreen that would be great for someone under 40
since it's an allergy
this cream didn't feel moisturizing to me at all
i wanted the night cream to help prevent wrinkles
moisturize my face better than regular creams for dry skin
not moisturizing enough for my dry skin.
please stop insisting i need sunscreen
petrolatum contained in its ingredients
although it is very moisturizing
too moisturizing to use in the day under concealer
mineral oil, petroleum, and paraffin.
it's more of a balm than a moisturizer.
the third ingredient is mineral oil
i prefer not to use products with mineral oil on my skin
i am new to using eye creams
t may be a good moisturizing
it was however moisturizing
it's very greasy--mineral oil
as little as i use my concealer runs
i asked the sales person for a very light or fragrance free face washcloth product
switched over to the gel creme
every face moisturize i have ever used includes sunblock
most of my primers pill up
this moisturizer never mattes my face.
s of mattefying lotion will feel cakey or pill up if i wipe my face
this moisturizer is good
continue the search for a good moisturizer.
so moisturizing without getting shiny or causing breakouts is always a challenge
the parfum/fragrance irritated my face
this moisturizer is light weight
i used the cleanser
toner that is part of the line
sadly many of their products contain parabens
more like a liquid rather than lotion
i kind of using it as a toner not a moisturizer
this is no better than drug store moisturizer
this product doesn't even help with moisturizing
as a regular moisturizer it is good
hunt down some ddf matte moisturizer
this moisturizer did nothing to help with matifying my skin
i originally use murad moisturizer that helps mattify
wasn't moisturizing enough for me.
'm not sure it was actually moisturizing
after washing and applied toner.
i applied this moisturizer.
it is a gel like
also not moisturizing enough for my skin.
i recommend caudalie daily perfecting fluid if you want a moisturizer that helps with shine
i loved how this moisturizer mattified my skin.
this moisturizer is good.
just need a moisturizer that isn't my nicer moisturizers
purchased this for a light, summer moisturizer.
i need something moisturizing
not too moisturizing since i'm oily combination
i cannot deny that this is moisturizing for my skin
i mix this cream with my arcona sunscreen.
i wanted a lightweight moisturizer for summer.
truth serum for several months
i never react to face creams
i used this as a daytime moisturizer instead because it just wasn't moisturizing enough for nighttime
shiseido's bioperformance advanced super revitalizer whitening formula works okay
i would not repurchase this moisturizer
the serum from shiseido's brightening line
i would consider this product as a good moisturizer
"whitening" isn't working at all
i didn't see any whitening result
this cleanser foams well
because i used a gentle cleanser from another br
this product is supposed to do 2 things: cleanse
which is to cleanse skin
any other foaming cleanser i have used
it is not moisturizing
i rather just bought a moisturizer
i do like this lotion
that it has spf
i used this as a moisturizing/spf base
my foundation looks cakey with this moisturizer.
now i just use it as a mild day moisturizer.
don't recomend any of the sunscreen lines
the lotion is not to greasy for my skin
this moisturizer is more like makeup.
you can not wear it without using a toner.
not for a daily moisturizer
you need to use moisturizer before it
its not moisturizing enough
not to mention it doesn't feel moisturizing at all
i mix it with another moisturizing lotion then apply it since it has spf 16
it is not moisturizing at all.
this one has a touch of sunscreen product
it doesnt moisturize at all.
maybe the emulsion or gel would have worked
i like the cream
not really as moisturizing as i was expecting for this dry winter
it's rich and moisturizing for the winter though.
i liked clinique eye/ face cream products.
i especially noticed this when i applied concealer after using this product
it is very moisturizing which i do love
i think it's great at moisturizing
i agree that it is good for moisturizing
no where as near as hydrating as some other eye creams i've used
moisturizes but thats about it.
helped my concealer go on smoother
just moisturizers, but that's it.
moisturizing the eye area well though
was moisturizing but that was it.
this product does not moisturize at all.
i do like the hydration
i find myself using 2-3 pumps of the gel cleanser
i only wear powder foundation
if you use a makeup remover first
i wear a non-waterproof mascara
my skin is combination
the cleanser itself was gel-like
this cleanser has been fine
get the clay cleanser
the ren matte balancing fluid because of the natural ingredients
natural skin care products
the anti- redness serum
i noticed that this product left a film like texture on my skin so when i did a second cleanse with my fresh soy cleanser
while this product may cleanse skin after all makeup
this one is a "one" for cleansing
like to use tinted moisturizers as a foundations or a light coverage foundation
i rubbed this cleansing milk between my h
i found this product to be "hydrating"
was recommended to choose over fresh soy wash
milky like your washing your face with lotion
a cleanser is supposed to refresh my skin
only cleanse my skin with coconut oil
use the ren glycol lactic exfoliating mask once per week
i needed to purchase a gentle cleanser to use with the clarisonic
i no longer have need for a facial cleanser
the cleanser leaves a film on the skin that stays on even after rinsing
rinsing it off and after i used my toner.
has no moisturizing effect
especially since i wear waterproof eyeliner
the moisturisers in particular
the thickness of this cream
i will stick with my korres greek yoghurt sleeping facial instead
this cream did not hydrate my skin at all
this product was not moisturizing enough for my skin
i would apply this product before bedtime
it' not moisturizing enough for night
pros: the cream was very moisturizing
lactoperoxidase/gluconolactone -- which is the kind of preservative ren should be using if they were seriously "clean skincare
this is a well known formaldehyde releaser.
i also picked up their mineral day cream
i did not really see a difference in my acne as i suffer from hormonal acne
i saw absolutely no purification of my skin after washing off the mask
i've used better acne cleansers from the drugstore
it feels like a lotion
i love this cleanser
5 stars for the cleanser and 0 for the packaging.
i don't need my acne cleanser to look cute i need it to be functional
this is not your average skin cleanser
reminded me of murphy's oil soap.
in combination with the cleanser from this line
yet effective acne treatment to help get rid of my acne
not as an all over face serum
waiting for the serum to completely absorb
the product flakes right off when i apply lotion
the bottle says you can use makeup or lotion over
there are other serums
most of it is hormonal acne
after reading such positive feedbacks regarding this product's efficacy against hormonal chin acne
this product also peels whenever you try to apply a moisturizer
it will pill/flake
it pills under the photodymanic therapy
the lady said this is actually allergy tested
it tends to "pill" if you try to wear it under foundation or with lotion
there are plenty of face creams/serums that have 2% salicylic acid
which is the only fda-approved active ingredient in this serum
i am able to wear this serum under makeup
decided to splurge on the dermadoctor serum
to me i thought amazing face wash plus expensive serum would equal flawless skin
not for me, i expect more from a serum.
it also has a strong medicinal smell when applied
i love the ain't misbehavin' facial cleanser
when i switched to a different anti-acne serum formulation
the product works for blackheads
might work on mild acne
bought the 60ml for try
i believe the micro exfoliating is too mild for it
it was very liquidity with no exfoliating particles at all
the original formula had rice bran wax as an ingredient
was gentle enough to use every day for exfoliating
now smell like vitamin c
loved this product when it was an actual exfoliator
it has micro beads or something exfoliating in it
nothing exfoliating about it.
i didn't moisturize my skin either
i asked for a product that was very exfoliating
exfoliating yet gentle as it claims
like if you open a bottle of some of their cleansers or moisturizers
i tried using it for texture issues/acne
for an exfoliating wash i still prefer the clinique daily scrub or a little baking soda mixed with my regular gel wash
i love the idea of a mild exfoliation
i don't like the primer-texture this serum has
i like my exfoliating products a little thicker in texture
this exfoliating wash was way too harsh for my skin
i've used another well-known vitamin c product for years
silicone isn't supposed to cause breakouts.
it's not really a serum
i've tried many vit c serums before
it seems to have a mattifying effect
it isn't what i would call a "serum"-- it isn't really a fluid
when a facial lotion gets to this price range
wanted to try a moisturizer with antioxidants after reading about how it might help my breakouts
the only way it sort of moisturized was when i used a serum underneath
this was definitely not moisturizing enough for me
it contains a nice amount of different antioxidant ingredients
this was definitely not moisturizing enough for me
it contains a nice amount of different antioxidant ingredients
i didnt find it particularly moisturizing
i would use this as a moisturizer in combination with "active" serums if i thought it warranted the price tag
this moisturizer isn't very moisturizing at all
it's not moisturizing enough
s compared to other "prestige" eye creams
my eyes look the same using a much cheaper drug store eye serum
think it's better to stick with a nice vit c/antioxidant produt
if you also need a hydrating eye cream
this cream is not at all rich/moisturizing enough
my cle de peau concealer looked cakey
which is very moisturizing
in my undereye wrinkles
this will make you concealer st
this moisturizer does not moisturize at all
it really was not moisturizing at all
its not as moisturizing as i thought
the toner is not great
this moisturizer was recommended to me to use along with the fresh clay toner
this moisturizer was a headache to use on a daily basis
oil-free moisturizer for you normal to oily skin i would recommend trying it
now i'm on the hunt for that perfect moisturizer for combination oily
after a week i saw no difference in "sebum production" or hormonal breakouts
left me feeling disappointed as the product is marketed as a non-comedogenic moisturizer that absorbs impurities from blocked pores
bought this instead of my usual soy moisturizer
it was not moisturizing at all
i think i'll stick to my fresh soy products from now on
the lotion itself was fine on my skin
trying to find my skins perfect moisturizer
as i have with their exfoliator in the past
i love the feeling of this moisturizer.
had to try this moisturizer
when i tried this lotion all over my face
had to supplement with a more moisturizing lotion for my face
will finish the container mixed with another moisturizer
after researching all of the night creams on sephora
i decided on this one because of the vitamins
nothing that a hydrating moisturizer cannot do
i used this for a few weeks with the liquid lotion
the acne solutions clarifying lotion
the dramatically different moisturizing cream in hopes that my problem would go away
i am acne prone
i prefer the soap.
i only use clinique face makeup
i think i'll stick to philosophy's purity gel cleanser
excess oils because it's a foam
i only have me acne
this emergency gel lotion however is a dud
very comparable to other benzoyl peroxide products
unlike other acne treatments i tried in the past
this product has benzoyl peroxide
benzoyl peroxide works well in 3%
dries clear unlike most benzoyl peroxide products
it is more lotion than gel- feels like a face moisturizer
it seems like the lotion-y "gel" just moisturizes the skin instead of actually doing anything
not an actual acne cream
i dont recommmend this for combination skin types bc it is a gel-lotion base
spot treated them with lightening gel
which was classified as probably hormonal by my dermatologist
visit your dermatologist asap to get the correct diagnosis
i've bought nip + fab glycolic pads
1/2 apple cider vinegar toner
look for something with 2% hydroquinone
hydroquinone only works on brown spots because it lightens skin
moisturizing is not the word to describe it
my mom had used hydroquinone cream before
the break down of collagen
i recommend you read about hydroquinone before you buy this product
i am not a fan of its gel texture
normally if i use a moisturizer like this
why do beauty companies need to scent moisturizers?
i think i'd like something creamier/more moisturizing
i love glycolic acid
to be honest it was not hydrating at all for a nighttime moisturizer
my acne-prone combo skin did not like the oils
it really moisturize the skin that all it dose
i do use tne serum and that works great.
caudalie's night correcting cream did not lighten my dark spots like caudalie's "vinoperfect radiance serum" has
tried the "radiance serum"
truly i prefer the "radiance serum" to the night correcting cream
i take vitamins, dont smoke and use sunscreen.
i take care of my skin.
the only positive is that i do think it was slightly moisturizing
except act as a moisturizer
ptr's un-wrinkle night is an average preventative moisturizer
never had facial acne
luxurious-looking reusable plastic soap container
of acne soap or cleanser in the past as a h
even after i applied the moisture surge lotion after using it
this cleanser is one of the first acne-targeting cleansers i have used that did not dry out my skin
i'll stick to the boscia purifying cleansing gel instead
i will be switching back to the boscia detoxifying black cleanser
like other acne products i've tried
exchanged for detoxifying black cleanser that i used before
the cleanser did a great job of cleaning
a lot of hype for this cleanser.
wash with salicylic acid
this cleanser smelled like detergent
don't try this if you're used to gentle cleansers like the fresh soy cleanser
which i am acne prone
i will switch to the boscia detoxifying black cleanser instead
the black detoxifying cleanser
if you want a lightweight gel moisturizer for oily skin you have found it
not worth the money to reduce hormonal acne
since sephora stopped carrying juice beauty anti blemish serum
going for a product with salicylic acid in it
a sephora associate suggested this acne fighting/preventing serum
apply all over face after cleanser
i prefer benzoyl peroxide formula to spot treat over a gel or treatment to put over the whole face
this product is made from natural ingredients
help reduce the blackheads/acne
so the search continues for a mattifying gel
then use redness solution moisturizer after
this works as a cleanser
you would either have to get a makeup remover to use prior to this cleanser
my redness is not from acne
i love all the other redness solutions products
this cleanser is non foaming.
the cleanser feels slimmy like if you mixed a body lotion with water
i got this in the redness solutions kit
not marketed it as a "redness solution"
non irritating on my rosacea skin
it does cleanse your skin
mascara was still on
i realize its a gentle cleanser
i also tried rinsing it off
it also did not exfoliate my skin
feels like lotion more than a cleanser.
i expected this cleanser
clinique redness solutions cleanser
maybe if i use the redness solution lotion it would help more
wanted a gentle cleanser that would counteract the redness
an eye makeup remover is a must.
it didn't help my allergy related redness- i get red faced with the arrival of spring pollen
a cleanser it is not
paired with various serums
it hydrates my skin.
i would not recommend this moisturizer for redness correction
it's ok for moisturizing the skin
however this daily cream wasn't moisturizing enough for my super dry skin
this lotion was hydrating
this moisturizer cream did not help with redness it made the redness more red
this is a good oil-free moisturizer that didn't cause breakouts on my acne-prone skin
clinique redness solutions is a decent moisturizer
my derm told me that clinique was the best for rosacea
i also don't use their other recommended products like the cleansing product for redness
back to dramatically different moisturizing gel
this moisturizer also felt cooling
try to use it up as a moisturizer
acne prone with rosacea
this is the first clinique redness cream i've tried
this product is fine as a moisturizer
still like the texture of this serum
i think this eye cream is ok as a moisturizer for the eye area
as far as the exfoliating factor goes
i feel like i could easily get the same "exfoliating" effect with a gentle exfoliating cleanser
this did nothing to even my skintone or reduce my hyperpigmentation
philosophy made a peel using papaya
called it an enzyme peel
liquid ran out of the bottle then what appeared to be exfoliant
photosensitizing citrus oils used
s when you mix it with your serum or moisturizer though is horrible
i find it's easier using serums/ creams for vitamin c
i would mix it with my other moisturizers.
this one wasn't moisturizing enough
sunscreen of foundation with spf
wanted to be able to add vitamin c at different parts of my regimen
i am a huge fan of vitamin c
recently switched to the murad skin perfecting lotion to get some retinol into my routine
though clinical research supports the benefits of topical vitamin c
if you persit in wanting a placebo
you can buy laa powder at your local vitamin shop for far less money
i mix this with my clinique smart custom repair serum
i tried it with my moisturizer
my moisturizer is expensive
next time i'll purchase a serum with c already in it
i ordered this when an esthetician told me that vit c would help me with my slight hyper pigmentation
i added this to my am moisturizer
it starts repelling my sunscreen （i have used the same sunscreen product for years
if i use this product with my sunscreen with this powder
the results werent drastically better than the vitamin c serum i have used in the past
into my serum or moisturizer
bought mostly for eye moisturizer
it seems to be a little bit moisturizing
the flaking makes applying concealer difficult
i even tried applying this over shiseido eye serum
i gave it 2 stars because it's moisturizing
pull out my concealer when i need coverage
even creams containing 14 k gold
concealer goes on smoother
not as moisturizing as i liked
i've tried plenty of eye creams
i found it not as moisturizing as other eye creams i've tried
it's not very moisturizing either.
i mean its moisturizing ill give it that
there is really nothing amazing about this product just an average slightly moisturizing cream
this cream is neither very moisturizing nor does it brighten at all
it smells like the other whitening products from shiseido
this eye cream is not moisturizing enough.
it moisturizes and that's about all.
minus the extremely chemically/paint smell
it feels so moisturizing going on but that's it.
i returned this lotion because it was not hydrating at all
my facialist recommended i stop using this to see if it was the culprit for my change in skin
this product has silicone in it
this product give me acne
the moisturizer is very light weight
the only way this product works for me is if i use it as a 5 minute moisturizing mask
a more moisturizing effect could be obtained with drugstore moisturizers
this moisturizer left me dryer than ever
or acne prone skin
now i look for moisturizer without dimethicone
i now just use aloe gel on my face.
while this is a good moisturizer
the cream cause my skin to micro exfoliate
like i have a sunburn
it was the perfect moisturizer for my skin
this is not the moisturizer for me.
it's not very moisturizing.
this is a great nighttime moisturizer
this moisturizer is fine
forth about purchasing perricone md face finishing moisturizer
4- its over over overpriced for a moisturizer that doesnt moisturize
it is definitely this moisturizer
anti-aging moisturizer i could use during the day with or without makeup
received a sample with points- disliked heavy rose scent-i like face lotions to be unscented-used as a h
this moisturizer was super hydrating
the cream did moisturize throughout the night
i ordered this moisturizer online
there are a million moisturizers out there
i don't find it very moisturizing
while this moisturizer is rich
i love the texture of the moisturizer
this moisturizer was hydrating
i realize there are different schools of thought on whether or not gluten allergies can be triggered by cosmetics
didn't feel as moisturizing on my skin as other moisturizers
this moisturizer leaves a film
it did not moisturize
i must have been allergic to something in it.
not very moisturizing for me.
works great as a makeup primer because of the silicones
am using a different moisturizer now
in a serum form would penetrate the skin more
will be spending my money on a serum next time
while i am a big fan of the lifting serum
this nightime restorative treatment is all hype
i did not find this product to be restorative.
your skin absorbs the cream
i personally like to use the dr perricone hypoallergenic gentle cleanser in the winter--the hypoallergenic line is amazing
i decided to try the hypoallergenic cleanser instead
the hypoallergenic cleanser leaves me without a trace of makeup
the nutritive may be a good bet
i prefer cream cleansers.
it smells like my dog's shampoo
then i got the nutritive cleanser
will stick with the citrus cleanser.
at first when i switched from cream to this foaming cleanser
i decided to give this a try since i do like the toner
i used this with he firming toner.
this product hydrates around the eye
if the idea of treating wrinkle is freezing your skin
i tried the eye therapy for 7 weeks.
the wrinkles i started with are the wrinkles
it does help with puffiness.
at one time the perricone eye therapy products did work to reduce the puffiness under my eyes
do like his cleaner and moisturizer.
i must be allergic to this product.
it is very moisturizing
so first of all i'm allergic to it
had to return the product i was allergic to the product
it is an average facial wash.
i like the cleanser
i need a cleanser to remove my makeup.
not combination or acne skin type
i like this product it was very moisturizing.
it did moisturize my skin
the benefits from this moisturizer did not justify spending this much on a moisturizer
used it with cold serum
use face finishing moisturizer instead
did nothing to moisturize my skin
keep your $145 because this toner is not worth it
i agree with one other review…the serum shoots above the cotton pad when you press the pump
that could be because most of the serum goes on the floor
itchy even after putting serum
what is that....a serum prep...a toner?
the serum prep is the only brown bottle product
i've never been a fan of foaming cleansers
i went for a facial today
she recommended discontinuing cleanser
exfoliating wash at night
while it does a fine job of moisturizing
i think i was paying only for beautiful bottle this serum in
because this serum is so expensive
my search for the perfect serum continues...
asked for a moisturizer that is organic for super dry skin
loved the lightness except that it's not moisturizing enough
i'd prefer using one with spf for a day cream
it is supposed to be formulated specificly for dry skin
ren's ultra-moisture day cream is not formulated for oily skin
it really helps with moisturizing
as my acne is countable
helps my skin redness
this moisturizer is okay.
it is not as moisturizing as i would like it to be
i think because of the cleanser i've been using
it is a thicker moisturizer.
i like this line because it has no preservatives
go for mattifying cream.
this product doesn't give me enough moisturizing
that should have given me a clue that it would probably be too moisturizing for oily skin
i need an oil-free moisturizer for daytime use.
there are many amazing moisturizers out there
it has no sunscreen which is the #1 protectant you need for your skin
heavy to be a morning moisturizer for me
wish this cream had spf
ing that citrus oils break down in sunlight into free radicals
this moisturizer left a film on my face
i prefer unscented if possible
currently going through hormonal breakouts
sephora employee recommended as the most hydrating
this moisturizer has shea
this moisturizer should suit you just fine
i spent a long time in sephora recently weighing options for natural moisturizer that was free of salicylic acid
i chose this product along with the ren serum
ter in the evercalm moisturizer
i used this in conjunction with the redness serum
this is a good moisturizer
i got the facial moisturizer from first aid beauty instead
it's a much better sunscreen than most drug store br
i tried this product after using korres skin creams for years
this gel cream moisturizer is decent
it's not moisturizing enough
it felt like lotion
this cream kept my skin matte for about 30 minutes
i tried this as a daytime moisturizer
this is not a very moisturizing product.
blue cypress facial wash because of the natural ingredients
commitment to clean bioactive skin care
it's also more of a clear serum than a cream
i used this cream in conjuction with the serum
i wouldn't say its super hydrating for them.
dryer skin with less elasticity
the firmness of my skin
their soy face cleanser also has that cucumber scent
i don't know if i'm allergic to any of the ingredient
i still wear moisturizer
i can't speak to any collagen boosting benefits because the heaviness of this cream
perhaps other anti-aging creams such as korres wild rose 24-hour moisturizing
or algenist regenerative anti-aging moisturizer might have been better
it is a very nice, rich, moisturizing cream.
it moisturizes my sensitive skin
it's a nice moisturizing face cream
like all anti-aging/firming creams
t provides a little exfoliation as you rub the product on your face
the best use of this may be a mild exfoliant for those with sensitive skin
this product is really allergy for my skin.
the soy cleanser i will purchase again
was one of my hg cleansers
i followed it with my toner
foaming cleanser usually works on my skin
moisturizers at the same time
ultra moisturizing masks to try to repair the damage
fresh soy face wash can do a better job
it works better if paired with a sturdy washcloth or followed with an exfoliating toner
feels like washing my face with perfume
despite the residue it doesn't even feel moisturizing
i otherwise don't use toner
it reminded my of dial soap
i try to avoid fragrance in my facial routine
doesn't emulsify like the shu umera cleansing oils
pure argan oil is a savior for a number of skin/hair issues
i love it on my frizz-prone hair.
i tried to use this in my coloured hair tips
when it wasn't making my hair oily it did do some moisturizing
i used it under my moisturizer it works
am testing out new moisturizers
i moisturize before i do my makeup
i've tried it at night and under my moisturizer .
it didn't moisturize my skin
the only way i could use it was to layer another moisturizing serum
hyaluronic acid is a humectant which means it draws in water from the air into your skin
the next morning i used this new moisturizer over the serum
flakey even after exfoliating every few days
i tried layering different moisturizers on different occasions
if you research algae
this is a descent serum with a good amount of skin-repairing ingredients
you can buy hylauronic acid serum in many places ---
i'd suggest a snail mucin product instead.
it has sodium hyaluronate which
don't recommend for acne prone skin.
with other moisturizers on top
glycolic acid face wash
hyaluronic acid is a potent hydrophilic substance
this product would be more useful if it came with an accompanying water mister / spritzer
then spritz on some clean de-ionized water
i exfoliate three times a week
this serum didn't hydrate my skin at all
hyaluronic acid does hydrate
following immediately with my moisturizer
i love hyaluronic acid
this did moisturize my skin
not more than my drug store gel cream
non "sunscreen feeling" moisturizer which was what i was going for
it smells like sunscreen
looks like sunscreen both in the container
this is one moisturizer i hate
i love the clinique moisture surge gel
the new formula smells like sunscreen
cannot use this moisturizer with it
it smells like sunscreen when you put it on
not a huge fan of the sunscreen smell
or i would just wear sunscreen each day
i love the clinique moisturizers
none of my previous moisturizers smelled that strongly of sunscreen
while the lotion is light
after i apply this moisturizer
figured i'd look for a lightweight clinique moisturizer with spf
that sheen that an actual sunscreen gives
i like the lotion overall
i've found that with most lotions with spf
i don't have this problem with other moisturizers
for something that is suppose to be super moisturizing i'm disappointed
if you read about this product it says this moisturizer helps neutralize uva
this moisturizer is strange
needed to replace my moisturizer
i also agree that it time to upgrade to a moisturizer for oily skin
the youth surge moisturizer
it may be caused by the vehicle for the sunscreen
definitely test this moisturizer on a small patch of skin first
at the counter i was amazed at how moisturizing
my go-to for moisturizing my skin used to be l'occitane shea
'sadly' because it was great at moisturizing
i decided to try this moisturizer
it would be a great light weight or summer moisturizer for women under 30
feel like it's more drying than moisturizing
was probably the oxybenzone.
i love a variety of creams
it doesn't seem as moisturizing as i expected from something labeled dry combination
first of all, it stinks like a sunscreen.
wasn't even as moisturizing as some of my other eye creams
it does not moisturize at all.
moisturizing but took too long to absorbs.
i wanted a moisturizer with a higher spf
isn't a moisturizer supposed to moisturize?
that i'm going to have to use two moisturizers or something
don't care for the sunscreen smell
clinique doesn't uses scents in their products
i've never use an anti-age moisturizer before
the smell of sunscreen is something i cannot get used to
the cleanser was not quite moisturizing enough-- not drying
went back to my go-to cleanser of korres yoghurt cleanser
i switched to non-foam cleanser
this cleanser is foamy
i would give it 4 stars for its ability to moisturize
this moisturizer wasn't for me.
horrible results with concealer
this product is more of a moisturizer
i tried the rose toner
i'd apply this before my makeup as an everyday moisturizer
first off, i hate how liquidy this lotion is.
this moisturizer did help with my oiliness.
i found that either this moisturizer or the acne face cleanser from murad made my skin texture like s
it felt like i was putting sunscreen on.
-alone moisturizer as i don't like to have an spf in my moisturizer as it decreases the other benefits
it smells like sunscreen, not that i cared.
this cleanser is so heavy on my skin
i wanted a foaming cleanser for normal/dry skin to use with my clarisonic
the herbal/medicinal smell
i only use cream cleansers
this cleanser is all right.
foaming cleansers strip your skin
especially when i exfoliated or used any spot treatment
the search continues for a keepsake cleanser
thought i'd try this cleanser
bought the alpine herbs cleanser which i love
this cleanser is okay
i also didn't find it as moisturizing as some other lancôme products
it's like an exfoliate for me.
doesn't moisturize dry skin or minimize lines.
it is definitely very moisturizing
but, i needed a true anti- wrinkle cream.
it is a good moisturizer
the cream itself had a fragrance
this cream is moisturizing
it isn't very moisturizing either.
did not moisturize eye area at all
i try all of these eye creams
this product has made it so that whatever moisturizing cream i try to causes my skin in the eye area to burn
it hydrates and moisturizes too.
this eye serum was "okay"
the lotion is harsh on my skin.
but does not work well with acne regimen.
that does not use other products with glycolic acid already in them
it ended up drying out my skin way more than the retinoid gel prescribed by my dermatologist
my retinol days are over
putting on plenty of moisturizer
though i like her retin-a cream
it does a good job of moisturizing my combination/oily skin
absorbs into skin like a serum
it also burns my skin even if i don't use a toner
moisturizing for combination skin
as a versatile use moisturizer
it smells like a tanning mousse or something i've used before
i'll pay for good moisturizers
as well as anti age retinol
acne prone combo skin
when i started using this moisturizer
i normally don't mind fragranced facial products
a very herbal and stinky smelling moisturizer.
unfortunately i think i'm allergic to an ingredient
my skin just isn't getting the moisture is needs from this lotion
kate somerville's nourish daily moisturizer is definitely not for me
one woman brought this nourish daily moisturizer along with kate somerville's quench
i didn't think this moisturizer was lightweight at all
it does a good job moisturizing
i'll use it as a nightime moisturizer until i use it up
didn't hydrate my sensitive skin
this moisturizer smells natural
has about as much moisturizing as my oily skin can h
just needed a daily cleanser
i find for my acne prone
attempted to use this as a daily face moisturizer
that it would be including in the mia 2 "hydrating" set
i wanted to use this product because i tried the exfoliator
the texture of this cleanser is smooth
grime my purity foaming cleanser does not
even after moisturizing several times
this is not a gentle cleanser
non-drying cleanser for sensitive skin
i returned this product for a more creamy cleanser
i moisturize right after cleansing
i did like that it has botanicals
the green exfolikate cleanser daily foaming wash
this detox daily cleanser did not help with preventing acne
didn't work at all for reducing acne or blackheads
which means that i need more moisturizer
my skin is prone to acne
an oil free moisturizer
ive tried the daily exfoliating cleanser
this didnt help my breakouts/acne at all!
this cleanser is okay.
i will say the smell of the gdw is better than this detox daily cleanser
unfortunately to me this cleanser has a very strong medicinal scent to it
this cleanser is like cheap br
i can't stop comparing this cleanser to sunlight dish soap
now that i switched to a clarisonic with a boscia sulfate free cleanser i am realizing how little this cleanser really helped my skin
therefore defeats the purpose of moisturizing with this product
for such a pricey moisturizer
i enjoyed this moisturizer.
this moisturizer was advertised for oily skin.
i like this moisturizer
if the price of this moisturizer was
plus i have used the exfoliation product in this line with no issues
it's not even that moisturizing.
this moisturizer is great for acne prone skin or sensitive skin
go with another moisturizer
if i put powder on my face after the moisturizer
this product claims its an "an antiaging hydrator for combination
i don't have acne.
i'll go back to using a gel moisturizer which i would recommend for combo/oily skin
this moisturizer is not one of them.
it wasn't very moisturizing at all
this moisturizer still doesn't help in hydrating my skin or help control oil
hydrating/moisturizing your skin
oil-free moisturizers work just fine in providing hydration
it just wasn't moisturizing enough
i just wish it was more moisturizing.
this moisturizer provided no moisture for my skin
all i wanted was a gentle oil-free moisturizer
was constantly looking around for new moisturizers
i like how it dispenses the moisturizer in a contained fashion
unfortunately this was no where moisturizing enough to stop my skin from flaking at the end of the day
now have a terrible contact dermatitis/skin allergy all over my face
which could be from the benzoyl peroxide
love the detox cleanser
this lotion is too intense
i did use a moisturizer on top of this product
is that anything that touches this lotion
at 5% has a bleaching effect
high end acne medications
this lotion did nothing for my skin.
back to proactiv lotion it is!
it puzzles me how a moisturizer could be so drying even after toner
i love this moisturizer.
there are better moisturizers out there that are more hydrating than this
a perfect amount of lotion comes out
it just wasn't moisturizing enough for my stressed out
the lactic acid from the goat milk was initially a little strongly scented
just wish it was more moisturizing
this is an average moisturizer.
i actually received this moisturizer as a gift
more moisturizing products out there for the price
it wasn't as moisturizing as it should have been
aloe vera gel was very close to top of ingredient list
aloe has dropped down the list
this moisturizer made me break out
water as the first 5 ingredients
the reformulated product does not sink in nor moisturize my skin
the changed product isn't nearly as hydrating
ones that contained aloe
i don't like sticky face lotions/creams!
this did not feel moisturizing enough for my skin
it is light wight and not moisturizing enough.
detox daily cleanser was ok.
so dry i was moisturizing up to 6 times per day
so just keep in mind this may cause an additive effect to dry skin
this cleanser definitely feel cleaner than other cleansers i've used
i usually use kate somerville's detox daily cleanser which i love
i know with new moisturizer
used it as a serum before ole moisturizer after clenser
s on her creams
her vitamin serum to more results-oriented
if you are allergic to retinol
decided to try her eye creams
i tried two different eye creams
i am a huge fan of the kate sommerville exfoliating treatment
her vitamin serum to be well worth the money
this serum felt very topical
this product gave me allergic reactions after only two applications---redness
at first i thought i was hormonal
i love the feel of this serum
add argan oil at night
this product was recommended to me by the salon where i had my facial
there are much better moisturizing products out there
moisturizing felling of when i first put it on
i may be sensitive to the vitamin a/retinyl palmitate in the product
goes on like a primer not a serum.
was hoping that this serum would help
i've always had hormonal imbalance skin problems
there are better serums out there actually with potent vitamins
especially with a formula that doesn't make my skin breakout due to the oils in the lotion nor make my face look like i just fut a coat of urethane on it
there is another serum on the line thats less greasy
impurities in one step"
i followed it up with a soft toner
i got this because i love the rice enzyme peel
like the philosophy face cleansers
it contains sunflower seed oil
contains small exfoliating particles
have to resort to my makeup remover al
i've used many cleansing oils
balms in the past
although this removed my sunscreen
i only had on a bit of concealer
i really love cleansing oils
i like cleansing oils
i love this oil cleanser!
so my acne is hormonal
this product is not for acne prone skin.
go for the enzyme treatment
i also tried the josie maran argan oil cleansing oil
i'd recommend this moisturizer for those with dry skin
*sad face* i will stick with my effective $6 moisturizer
i am going to try their rejuvenating serum instead
it was not moisturizing enough for me
light scent of this moisturizer
the lotion/gel is light
i actually have the regular rejuvenating cream
s packaging their serum in pumps
i normally use ce ferulic serum during the day
definitely the most drying serum i have ever used
for some reason i thought this was going to be more of a moisturizing serum
it's not moisturizing at all
with more vitamin c
pigment lightening gel or murad t-zone pore refining gel
this is probably the serum for you
saw this has glycolic acid
i know that vitamin c
ester c in particular
this serum applies very nicely
you can probably get the benefit of a vitamin c serum for a lot less money
i am allergic to quinine
which is really only found in products advertised with "tonic" properties
the ingredients in this product
the protein booster skin serum has a high peptide content
the product was slightly moisturizing
toning for my 50+ eye area
i decided to try this eye serum since the concentration of vitamin c is quite high
loved it however since it was re-formulated i don't think this serum does much
it's not even moisturizing.
invest in fish oil caplets
i would say that this c serum is beneficial to the eye area
if they called it a soothing serum
it does not accomplish the rejuvination miracle of vitamin c that it claims
making it look less smooth when i apply concealer
for the price $$ of this cream
it was too heavy for a serum.
i returned it for peter thomas roth's glycolic night serum for half the price
i still think dmae amine is one of the few topical products in the market that can help some people with sagginess
as with the eyelift
applied this product followed by the moisturizer from this line
careful of buying another one that contains retinol
when i try to put moisturizer on for the flakiness
beyond any retinol product i have tried
it wanted this to be my solution to hormonal breakouts
my skin is combination.
i wanted to replace my fresh clay mask to both exfoliate
i think its best for oily skin for mattifying the skin purposes
i stopped using pro-activ specifically because of the benzoyl peroxide bleaching everything i wore/slept on
i think i'll just stick with the exfoliating scrub when i need a bit of a boost
first i don't have acne
didn't find it to do much of anything beyond basic moisturizing
the formulation is greasy
it was definitely moisturizing
this face lotion is very moisturizing
doesn't do anything for antiaging
which is more emollient
i much prefer nude's advanced renewal moisturizer
after several weeks of trying out samples of new moisturizers i chose caudalie premier cru the cream
the cream is very moisturizing
as a moisturizing face cream, it's great.
as an anti-aging cream, it's a sham.
this face moisturizer doesn't smell as bad the cold plasma sub-d
if you start searching perricone cold plasma
it reminds me of those fish oil pills
the product itself works great for moisturizing
was excited to try cold plasma
another failed spf moisturizer for me.
like every other spf moisturizer i've tried
i applied it after the serum
i made sure that the serum had plenty of time to be absorbed before adding the moisturizer
i went back to using the yellow moisturizer after the serum
which i use the serum
i don't like the greasy feeling of the sunscreen
i used it in conjunction with clinique dark spot corrector serum
it doesnt do what it says it will do maybe except for the moisturizing part
the bottle is spf 15?
i can only use it as a night moisturizer
it is great as a daily moisturizer with spf
most lotions/moisturizers are way too heavy
it wasent this moisturizer made me break out
as a moisturizer it is rich
the cream is definitely moisturizing
i love the genifique serum
i need to layer this with a more moisturizing cream
eye cream that would moisturize
in the morning if i end up using concealer
provide smooth canvas for applying concealer
i like that this eye cream is a cream gel
it was good for moisturizing
it's not moisturizing at all
even tried layering a super moisturizing eye cream on top
worked on my tarte waterproof mascara
the cleanser itself is fine.
i love the fab moisturizer
i received this cleanser in the fab holiday boxing day sale set along with their facial radiance pads
the cleanser takes off makeup well
from the eyeliner/mascara
it suds up pretty good compared to the lotion facial cleansers i have tried through sephora
mascara is the major test for any cleanser
he uses a very hydrating moisturizer
i needed a new cleanser
the eye serum is very cooling.
i've used this detox eye roller exactly as directed
acted like a major exfoliant
easy to use under moisturizer
maybe i'd be better off using vitamin e or something natural than paying $30 for this
smells kinda like sunscreen to me
so this moisturizer has to go
i got this cream in a kit including the cleanser
that's the only time i'll use this lotion
i love the fact that it's unscented because i hate moisturizers with strong fragrances
it doesn't have any artificial fragrances
this is not my idea of a serum it's more of a hydrating cream/serum
i didn't find it to be particularly moisturizing
this should not be marketed as a face lotion.
this moisturizer clings to it
when the sales person put this anti-redness serum/lotion on my h
thta's what i want for a summer lotion
i won't be buying this again as a facial moisturizer
i am using it as a body cream
you need to use this with a serum beforeh
the cream has a horrible, medicinal smell.
it works for mild redness relief
it states it uses caffeine
it was more like a lotion than a serum
i went back to using the regular serum/moisturizer
still searching for a lightweight serum to use daily under sunscreen in the morning
its not so much a serum as the label indicates
or clear serum-like product
used the fab products line including this product plus the moisturized
started applying this before moisturizer
this serum did not work for my skin
this just wasn't moisturizing enough for my skin
it does feel more like a moisturizer rather than serum
it reminded me of hair bleach.
the sales associates call redness
is used as a preservative/fragrance booster
not very moisturizing either.
and it feels more like a moisturizer.
not a serum like what everyone was saying.
disclaimer: this isn't much of a serum.
the texture is definitely more like a moisturizing cream
don't know how this would perform for someone with chronic facial redness
it definitely doesn't fix redness nor feels like a serum
i tried this serum with the hope that it'd make my skin appear less red
this really has no moisturizing properties
there is caffeine in it
this product is semi-moisturizing
i really wanted to like this serum
ful of other moisturizers at the drugstore that i like better
i think it's the colloidal sulfur in it.
this serum didn't work
i didn't notice any improvement in redness with this serum
when the serum dried if ii rubbed my skin it would pill up
works well with my moisturizer and my foundation.
this product did moisturize my skin
first, this is not a serum.
if you suffer with rosacea
this is not a serum.
it is a thin lotion.
goes on like a moisturizer
the texture of this serum was great: felt cooling
this has a consistency like a lotion.
did not feel serum-like at all
i really like the way this serum feels
it is a good moisturizer
i really like this product as a moisturizer.
get the 3% retinol serum to see if that does better
without my night moisturizer
have tried so many retinol products
for the high price tag i expected to see some peeling/exfoliating or some kind of change to my skin
i saw no mattifying from this lotion at all.
there is no mattifying
the serum is so thin
you end up loosing serum either way
c serum and peel pads.
my skin is not prone to acne
i've tried many oil cleansers
oils into my skin
got it to get rid of the water-resistant sunscreens i use
try a toner afterwards for best results
i'd use a foam cleanser after the cleansing oil
i recommend using a regular sun-block lotion
it does a good job cleansing the sunscreen off.
use other cleansing oil for the sunscreen
i wear waterproof mascara
shiseido did remove the mascara
only after two washings
retinol last ingredient behind even perfume
made my wrinkles st
it didn't really control my oily skin any more than the twelve dollar mattifying moisturizer i buy from the drug store
this is a great moisturizer for ladies with oily skin
i don't like this lotion at all.
it's not very moisturizing
has a few comedogenic ingredients in it.
in combination with my other mattifying products
i tried this moisturizer
with the exception of his microdermabrasion exfoliant
it smells very close to the sulfur containing acne creams
or the refreshing herbal scent
it seemed somewhat moisturizing
bought this lotion thinking all br
also, the mentholated product (tea tree?)
this product is also not very moisturizing
this is not moisturizing.
i don't feel it provided any deep moisturizing
this moisturizer is the consistency of hair conditioner
stick with my perricone face finishing moisturizer
after applying this moisturizer
non greasy day moisturizer that will work with my combination skin for a while now
i would prefer to use the lotus moisturizer over this one
that usually only affects me when i use facial cleansers
not lotions or moisturizers
for the price of this moisturizer
drug store vitamin c cream which is working well
i would like this moisturizer - if it was summer.
for winter i wanted something thicker or more moisturizing to fight off those fine lines
is not very moisturizing
i don't use waterproof mascara
i do wear a good layer of foundation powder bronzer blush everyday
their charcoal makeup remover balm is wayyyy better than this
does not leave the skin feeling "purified" as promised
for those not planning to moisturize after using a makeup remover
i do like their warming cleanser.
i love my boscia detoxifying black cleanser
the detoxifying black cleanser
i decided to try boscia makeup-breakup cleansing oil
after using the boscia black detoxifying cleanser
non-waterproof mascara on a daily basis
i usually remove my makeup in the shower with cera ve lotion cleanser
for waterproof mascara i remove it first with waterproof eye makeup remover then cleanse as usual
in the shower with the konjac sponge
i do use primers
does not remove my waterproof mascara
after i go over my skin with my toner on a cotton pad
i decided to try this after hearing how wonderful it is for hormonal acne for adults with dry skin
i love the toner
tried this cleanser since i suffer with acne
my dermatologist has a cleanser with similar ingredients
than with any other cleanser
this helped my redness
the ptr retinol night oil
i used the other acne cleanser before this one
it also smells really chemically which it gross to me
thanks to this cleanser i found out i have an intolerance to salicylic acid
can't use no product that contains salicylates.
still have hormonal breakouts
i hasn't helped my acne
second, when i used concealer, the serum flaked.
i sometimes found the serum irritating to my eyes
this serum did nothing for me
have found the glycolic 10%
the consistency is that of a lotion
look for a more hydrating moisturizer
i like the lotion itself.
i put on an extra sunscreen in the morning.
bought it to help hydrate.
after finding the perfect cleanser
for my oily ladies who like a little weight to their daytime moisturizer
whenever i use a lightweight moisturizer like this one before i start my day
this moisturizer was recommended to me at my home location as an oily skin remedy
i love the moisturizer
i wish i would've bought a more intense hydrating one
i moisturize with this
i think so far it does a good job at moisturizing my skin
the moisturizer is super lightweight
this moisturizer was recommended to me after loving the daily face moisturizer
not moisturizing my dry patches on my nose
purchased my daily face moisturizer instead
i love this moisturizer.
the only thing that helps is concealer
this product does not help puffiness.
the serum might just as well have been water
i recommend origins ginseng product
the serum itself does nothing for me.
compared to other eye serums
gave this de-puffing eye massage serum a try
any cooling item such as cold cucumber slices of even a cold spoon would do more than this serum
massages the eye area well
this is a eye serum
didn't expect this product to be moisturizing
i'd always use a eye moisturizer after this.
i did like that its a serum.
layers well underneath daily moisturizer
the texture is kinda watery instead of what i expected from "serum"
the corrective element is a light wax
best to wear at night since once the serum dries
it felt not as moisturizing as other serums i have tried
returned it for the origins anti aging serum
this serum is good
the serum is very thick
use another serum with it
it's more like a lotion.
the only thing i noticed from this serum
my corrective serum went back to sephora
the bio-performance super corrective serum has not impressed me
the serum is very rich
also, it is moisturizing without being greasy.
i've tried a great deal of facial products
with this bio-performance serum
the serum has a nice texture
have been using shiseido bio-performance super corrective serum for a couple of weeks
it works as well as other moisturizers
i like their essence serum much more.
still on the hunt for a perfect serum.
as a cream specifically targeted for hydrating
does a fine job moisturizing
it's called the dior hydralife rehydrating mask it's less money
the “pro-youth hydrating serum
” the “pro-youth protective crème
my dermatologist told me that i need to use antioxidant-rich products including vitamin c
i ended up using a concealer brush to apply this.
all it does is moisturize.
i found that after applying the eye creme
it ruins my concealer
dior worked their magic by plumping up those wrinkles
less expensive eye creams
this is not very moisturizing
if you want a light eye moisturizer
it was not nearly as moisturizing as i had hoped or what the product claimed
this undereye cream is great for moisturizing my undereye area
it does not pill up under my concealer
this product claims to reduce puffiness
this cream has it
i can use my face moisturizer for that
of dior's hydra life pro-youth sorbet eye crème.
this serum made me breakout!!!
seemed to be too moisturizing for my skin type
i used it in conjunction with algenist retinol cream
this serum made my skin break out and become red.
thought i'd splurge on this cleanser
used to use two of the other foaming cleansers
i love the cold plasma line
so the hypoallergenic was necessary?
just purchased cold plasma for the face
after speaking with a perricone rep at sephora i decided to buy the cold plasma eye in lieu of the perricone serum
this is the holy grail of eye creams
as i use the cold plasma face cream
this product was not nearly moisturizing enough.
i love the cold plasma face
i need more hydration
although the cold plasma eye serum seems to do a nice job
i tried the cold plasma eye cream
not for puffiness or hydration
acne isn't an issue
i needed a moisturizer with an spf since acne cleansers are a bit harsher on the skin
it's always suggested to walk outside with a sunscreen
better off buying a gentile drugstore moisturizer with spf
i went back to ultra repair lotion
i like this because it has skin lightening ingredients
this moisturizer claims to do a lot!
not to mention i saw 0 antiaging benefits in the ingredient list
i much prefer the paulas choice spf 30 moisturizer
i love the cleanser
it is very moisturizing
asked for an anti-aging moisturizer
ran out of my moisturizer
it felt like a layer of sunblock over my skin
use a lighter moisturizer before putting on makeup
i am allergic to the sunscreen in the product
i found the product more greasy than moisturizing
i love first aid beauty ultra repair creme
bought this for the sunscreen
as a sunscreen this works fine
i prefer a lotion that absorbs and is matte.
a good moisturizer for dry skin with an spf protection
although, it was somewhat moisturizing.
the daily application of topical medication was really drying out my skin
this moisturizer is just ok.
reminds me of chemical hair dye
i tried to like this moisturizer
i should not that i am on topical acne medicines which can be drying
just all around not that moisturizing
it can not be called a moisturizer 2
this moisturizer is ok.
it wasn't moisturizing enough
i love how it felt on my skin: lightweight yet moisturizing
i used this moisturizer after using the clear complexion cleanser
i find that pure vitamin e oil is a better moisturizer than this mess
i got this with the cleanser.
i like everything but this moisturizer.
the moisturizer just don't work
cons:- not moisturizing enough- smells awful
the oil-free moisturizer with spf15 broke me out.
the one positive thing i will say about this cleanser is that it did feel moisturizing
with the matching moisturizer
i paired this clay cleanser with ren's hot cloth cleanser as a pre-wash to remove my makeup
this cleanser is ok.
acne-prone skin not oil or combo acne-prone
would use a charcoal soap cleanser
i tried this cleanser
the stuff is moisturizing enough
i prefer lighter feeling moisturizers
this works fine as a moisturizer
except for that clay cleanser
this is a good moisturizer
i love the natural ingredients
it's also not moisturizing in anyway.
it did not moisturize skin
this new version is not nearly as moisturizing
meaning i have to use moisturizer with it
it's just moisturizing my skin and that's it.
this product is hydrating
chronic acne since adolescence
topical acne treatments do really dry you out
i love the moisturizer that comes in the blue labeled bottle though
this product was not moisturizing enough
please note that this product is no longer the night serum
ed as a "clarity serum"
i loved the herbal smell
i will repurchase my origins serum
i blend it with my moisturizer before applying
i tried this nighttime treatment
it does do a great job at moisturizing my skin
this product provided zero hydration to my combination skin
because i thought this was a night serum
it really shouldn't be called a serum
s of my micro facial hair
i put on moisturizer after
give it another shot b/c i love boscia's detoxifying black cleanser
i used it for a hydrating night cream.
i wish it were unscented!
for combo or oily complexions there are other day creams that are much better
i wanted a day cream with spf
i didn't get much of a "sunscreen smell" from it
repurchased the vitamin plus moisturizer
i'll keep using my spf 15 makeup over my moisturizer
i wouldn't mind a sunscreen smell
i dislike this moisturizer.
has the consistency of sunscreen
it gives a strong sunscreen feel to the skin
wouldn't feel like a sunscreen
smells like sunscreen on face
it smells like the serum
maybe it is the sunscreen...
love the natural ingredients
the sunscreen gets in my eyes
my main concern when choosing a moisturizer is that it is moisturizing enough for my dry skin
this really is moisturizing
while i love the idea of spf in my moisturizer
think old-school sunscreen
maybe because of the sunscreen
i wish the sunscreen rating were higher
i applied it after shower
i love this moisturizer
cheap sunblock on your face
the creme was hydrating
i've tried many serums in my life
i applied this serum in the mornings before applying makeup
wanted to try a new serum
it does t feel very moisturizing
i got a bottle of repairwear laser focus wrinkle
i did use spf along with this serum
worst serum bottle design!
this serum was fine
a nice moisturizer from clinique is moisture surge
the gel like texture feels as indulgent as a serum
decided to start using an anti-aging serum to prevent future wrinkles
after a month of this serum
use a good sunscreen every day
after using this serum for 3 weeks
i stopped using the serum
it just seems like it wastes some of the serum
moisturizing properties of this product
i've never been allergic to any of the creams
i applied this after my serum
it glides on like a primer providing a good base for my sunscreen
this moisturizer is amazing!
i do suffer from adult acne
i feels moisturizing once it's applied.
a moisturizing sunscreen to keep my skin from flaking in the dry manhattan winter
is moisturizing for a bit
it wasn't very moisturizing
did a mediocre/average job of moisturizing
liked it as a moisturizer though.
i've used a lot of cream cleansers
i could see it all on the cotton pad after i used toner on my skin
this has the consistency of lotion
it feels like lotion mixed with water
the original dior cleansing milk had a great mild fragrance that i had no problem with
this cream is light
thought i'd give the moisturizer a try
however i love bb's extra rich moisturizer.
using my regular moisturizer
decided to try the hydrating face cream
while it did a great job of moisturizing my skin it also left me with little pimples in the morning
feels like putting regular drugstore lotion on your face
i prefer it as a night time moisturizer.
it was just an ok moisturizer
they recommended this cream to me
it's ok as a moisturizer.
this face cream did basic moisturizing
because it has comedogenic ingredients
moisturizing- as any moisturizer should be
i still used a serum
i moisturized at least twice a day
a bobbi brown mua recommended this moisturizer as a must-have for use under foundation
no more hydrating than any other moisturizer!
it's a basic hydrating eye cream
this product will moisturize your under eye area
it is a hydrating eye cream, but that's it.
i received this and the face cream.
i found that this lotion has a lot of ingredients including retinyl palmitate
bought this with hydrating face cream
it's no longer moisturizing enough
my facial moisturizer could provide the same
i wouldn't recommend for contact wearers
any cream can be hydrating
a hydrating eye cream that will help prevent creasing too
concealer line with this eye cream
it is a good base for concealer
did not find this product any more hydrating than my usual under makeup eye or facial moisturizer
longer lasting hydrating effect
that you apply an eye cream before eye concealer
i like this eye cream
use eye creams for the moisturizing benefits
it did seem moisturizing
the moisturizing capability of the cream is on average
when i use toner on a cottonball following washing with the lathering tube soap
i tried this hoping it was a good sunscreen for my face
by mid day it was burning as most sunscreens do for me
i love their non sunscreen products
the lotion was not protective for me
the beauty balm twice a day
they took out the spf ingredient
the protective face lotion used to have sunscreen in it
atopic skin at age 63
it is too emollient for me skin
i love it as a moisturizer
as you all know this is a moisturizer
to me it is your average primer/moisturizer
i don't feel the moisturizing benefits it claims to have
does not have sunscreen for undereye area
lamer's eye creams are great
which is great for moisturizing over night
it's super moisturizing but makes my eyes sting.
this product though, is very moisturizing.
it totally gives the same affect as botox
i mixed it with serum
mix in with moisturizer
available at any health food or vitamin shop depending on br
i put moisturizer on top of the gel
absolutely no chance that this would work with any concealer or moisturizer
don't put moisturizer on afterwards
this serum made my skin feel very firm
feels like aloe vera on my face that's all
the ren o12 rose serum is a better value for me having dry skin
it is more hydrating
fragrance is an irritant
why put this in a moisturizer meant to soothe??
i prefer lighter weight moisturizers.
for reference i use clinique’s gel moisturizer
needed a light moisturizer for the summer
the serum ran out before the sorbet did
it's only good with the serum
or the serum is what's doing all the work
i've used it twice with the serum
i got the serum
it works as a moisturizer
it felt amazing on my skin song with the serum
i mix this moisturizer with another one i have
this is a fine moisturizer
it felt like any other moisturizer
i am a huge fan of their beauty elixir as well as their vinosource thirst quenching serum
which is why i wanted to purchase this moisturizer
i like very hydrating moisturizers
the formula is a 'sorbet' texture
not only this moisturizer does not moisturize at all
it's sort of a whipped moisturizing cream.
i need more moisturizing
the lotion was lightweight
i feel like i have to overuse lightweight lotions
you get the moisturizing feel when you first apply it
this lotion is moisturizing
a sunscreen & anti-aging product in one.
it has more avobenzone
it pills on my face
it also smell a bit like sunscreen
did this lotion help protect me against the sun or moisturize my skin?
em with wrinkle revenge 1 facial cleanser
i also purchased the serum and the wash.
over all after using the serum which i was instructed to use after the wash
many sunscreens make me break out
it does look, feel, and smell like sunscreen.
the product is not very moisturizing
feels like yucky sunscreen
i didn't see any results other than moisturizing
i didn't see any results from this other than a moisturizing sunscreen
it smelled just like regular sunscreen also
the cream caused my skin to have an allergic reaction
i can't say whether this sunscreen has any antiaging action
a sunlight activated lotion that offers spf
it "pills" like a sweater
the applicator was fine
hydrates the eye area
i've tried so many different eye creams for puffiness
could have done as much with aloe vera gel.
still need botox for the crows feet however.
the gel comes out
it works as a day moisturizer
it just seems to almost exfoliate my skin
this moisturizer sure does give me that "instant" hydration
it is very moisturizing to the rest of my face.
would love it if it was unscented.
winter with no paraben
not moisturizing enough for me
when i put makeup over the moisturizer
this replaced a water based moisturizer that was amazing
i used this moisturizer for years
after bare minerals raised the price on their daily moisturizer
i needed eye cream that was more hydrating for the winter
seems creamy and moisturizing to me.
i actually had an allergic reaction to it.
you can smell the natural ingredients in all their products
the concealer had worn off
just add my ptr mega rich eye cream for hydration
instead to get the resveratrol lift for my age
i recommend for younger women the resveratrol one just because the cru cream it's targeted to more mature skin
it was very moisturizing
helped with my undereye puffiness
this was basically is a serum.
i still had to layer other more moisturizing eye creams over this
it's not very moisturizing.
for something that's supposed to be anti-aging this is definitely not moisturizing enough
it's not as moisturizing as i would like
another reviewer stated this product isn't moisturizing as an eye cream is expected to be
no zinc oxide residue look
use it after my acne wash to keep my skin moisturized
did not moisturize my skin in the least!!
just a typical daily moisturizer with spf
it makes my concealer crease
very moisturizing i may say
an allergic reaction to it
maybe it's the sunscreen that caused that
while it was hydrating
just use the moisturizer you have
i'd rather spend the money on serum to use under the moisturizer
yes it is moisturizing
bought this eye cream because i loved their moisture bound moisturizer
i will finish the jar by layering it over my verso super eye serum as an under eye moisturizer
the salesperson at sephora kept raving about how moisturizing this eye gel was
while the eye gel was cooling
bought a serum from my facialist's line that serves double duty as my under eye product
i've tried plenty of eye creams
gels in the past
the texture is more like a lotion
it's a ok hydrating eye cream.
the gel is definitely hydrating
although this moisturizer is expensive
didn't do much for moisturizing my skin
it was my favourite moisturizer
considering the cost of the rejuvenating creme
it's loaded with synthetic fragrances
hyaluronic acid has been available for years
i do not like moisturizers to be perfumed
le i hope to find another moisturizer that helps my skin like this did without the perfume
some other botanicals which may account for the smell
there are other creams
serums that smell better
it smells like clinique aromatics elixir kept for 20 years
the product failed to hydrate my skin.
the serum has an old lady perfume smell
that i would need to start using a serum to prevent more lines
i think i will buy a more syrupy serum in the future
it was moisturizing and did smell nice.
i usually moisturize after this in the winter
the serum absorbs quickly
the serum was not intended to control oily skin
this serum makes a great foundation primer
the area where i used the serum felt like the skin of a newborn child
serum felt good, didnt see a difference in pores.
i do enjoy many of clinique's facial serums
im assuming good moisturizers
i tried this product because the "pore minimizer refining lotion" was discontinued by clinique
this pore refining solution corrective serum turns your skin greasy after one or two hours from application
the serum felt smooth
is this a cream or a lotion???
not moisturizing at all :
went for this superstar wrinkle reducer after recently having cosmetically altered my wrinkles with botox
forget the expensive wrinkle creams
look for local deals on dermal fillers
it was more like a $175 moisturizer.
perricone's high potency amine complex face treatment
have been using perricone nutritive cleanser
the dropper packaging is better for more aqueous consistencies
have become quite a fan of the firming / lifting serum
people with "sensitive skin" had a problem with this serum
this oil-free serum is greasy.
this serum is not great.
the serum claims to boost radiance
i won't waste any more time or money in this serum
i received this serum as part of a clarisonic plus kit
it smells like soy sauce
i found this serum to be very harsh for someone over 50
oz by a beauty editor
the moisturizer works well.
this did not moisturize my skin at all
it was a different moisturizer
i returned this pricey moisturizer.
it has the benefits of an anti-moisturizer as well
algenist anti-aging moisturizer i do not recommend
i could not enter this review under the product name restorative cream
sample of the algenist overnight restorative cream
it has dried my skin versus moisturizing.
still look forward to trying the serum
didn't find this to be moisturizing at all.
is it possible for a moisturizer to make fine lines
while its a good moisturizer
there are plenty of other anti-aging moisturizers on sephora
and it is not very moisturizing.
too pricey for just moisturizing
i used it w/the serum
the sunscreen smell is unpleasant
it feels as if sunscreen is in my eyes!
i needed the algenist moisturizer
he says this algenist anti-aging moisturizer spf 20 is too greasy
or heavy feeling over my vitamin c
the product truly hydrates
it was okay under concealer.
i've had better luck with tatcha's eye serum.
it is very moisturizing
it is moisturizing and generally ok though.
it's a good primer for my concealer
eye creams are expensive
moisturizing so of course a little goes a long way
this is very moisturizing
it was moisturizing for me
maybe the acid ingredient?
i got this as part of an algenist kit with a cleanser
have used the balm religiously
i even tried blending with moisturizer
could actually feel the skin tightening as the serum set
i did not have any issues applying concealer
when you add moisturizer
concealer or any kind of makeup on
i tried mixing it with an eye cream
you have to use it in conjunction with a moisturizer
tried blending it with my eye cream
figured i would give this a try after trying the facial firming products
if you add eye cream or put your concealer
if i put concealer over it
mixing it in with cream
with acne prone skin.
i hate to judge all cleansing oils by one
when you squirt an oil like the one from tatcha skincare it dissolves into a milk as soon as it touches water
i used bare minerals cleansing oil before this one
i find the fresh soy cleanser to be a better make up removing cleanser
i love oil cleansers
i liked josie maran's argan cleansing oil mostly.
in general i like oil cleansers a lot.
sucralose is actually an ingredient
as a cleanser, this works well.
i love cleansing oils
i used a cotton round with some toner after washing with the argan cleanser
i prefer a lighter oil cleanser.
smells like orange syrup like a childrens vitamins syrup
which is absurd for an oil cleanser
i needed a day time moisturizer that goes on after toner
"i don't eat my moisturizer"
i wanted a moisturizer with spf since i have very fair skin
not moisturizing enough for dry skin
its super moisturizing but it tastes weird.
i don't eat my moisturizer
wanted to try a daytime lotion with spf
much rather try out other moisturizers than splurge $30 for this whatevers moisturizer
this did a really great job moisturizing
it is supposed to be a oil free lotion
no wow factor about this moisturizer at all.
although this product was moisturizing
which i don't like for morning moisturizers
t soft as other moisturizers do [like clinique for example]
you could get a better moisturizer with spf in it
i only keep using it for the sunscreen
wanted to make sure it was the serum
it is a good moisturizer for maybe younger people or if you have a nice serum with antioxidants/ anti-aging this would go well
wish they made the moisturizer as a body lotion instead
overall it is moisturizing
i love how this moisturizer works
yes it is moisturizing
i found nothing really special about this facial cream
preformed just like any other creams/lotions you can purchase anywhere does
it is an amazing thickness for a night cream
this facial cream got great reviews
what i really hate about this facial cream is the greasiness
make this unscented please!
it did moisturizer skin around my eyes
did not find that it was moisturizing.
skin had to be supplemented with another moisturizer because it was drying
sure, it's moisturizing, but anything is really.
it is a good moisturizer for dryer skins
this eye cream just for moisturizing.
it is not very moisturizing either
it is hydrating though.
it's not moisturizing enough
although i will say this stuff is great for moisturizing
it is hydrating though!
which i haven't found with other eye creams
although it is moisturizing
it did not firm, brighten, or moisturize.
after that i cleanse
maybe i was allergic to an ingredient in the cream?
it is good at moisturizing
will finish the rest of the container because of the moisturizing
don’t’ really have wrinkles- using it as a preventative
it's moisturizing but that's about it.
this is an okay moisturizer
it did absolutely nothing to help my facial redness
it is lightly moisturizing.
i like the natural ingredients in it
this moisturizer isn't heavy
it feels like a matte moisturizer
dewy skin feeling i like in a serum
not even two coats of moisturizer
the pimples are like acne
i saw no results with this serum
it feels like an expensive moisturizer on my skin
having received kate somerville's cyctocell dermal energizing treatment as a sample
i love kate somerville cleansers and exfoliate.
rolls off when i apply concealer
then applied concealer with concealer brush
it was acting as an exfoliator
maybe the new peptide?
this is a cold and hydrating eye cream.
at *best* i noticed a mild moisturizing effect
all this one does is moisturize the eye area
if you want something moisturizing
this cream does hydrate my undereyes
it also smells like i'm putting my toddler's plain yogurt on my face
it would make my concealer look dull
this eye cream was hydrating
it was moisturizing sure.
which is a form of retinol
although the product is hydrating
i feel i look good for my age plus wear sunscreen
i like that it contains vitamins
didn't find it very moisturizing
this 5 in 1 didn't moisturize
i love this cleanser
i wanted the right cleanser for exfoliation
the exfoliation isn't too harsh on my skin
a sephora girl recommended this cleanser to me when i asked her about facial exfoliators
just a basic gentle cream cleanser.
it's not any better than a natural drugstore exfoliator
went back to the jojoba exfoliator which i've always loved
making it impossible to use it to exfoliate
guess i'll use it as body serum/lotion
i already use a vitamin c serum
i find i have to continuously rub my face to get the serum to penetrate
still on the search for that holy grail serum!
clearly vitamin c isn't for me.
gross' ferulic acid + retinol brightening solution
unfortunately this serum did nothing on my face.
i still don't know why my skin reacted this way to this serum
best thing about it is that it does have sunscreen protection
it is not very moisturizing nor does it tighten
gave me a terrible allergy attacks
the vitamin c/citrus smell actually caused misquotes to bite my face where i had put the eye cream on
got this product to go along with the truth is in the eyes vitamin c eye peel
i figured this would be similar except more moisturizing
this is a product with spf
including the truth serum
instead of the typical truth serum scent i love
i like the idea of spf in my eye cream
this is best used over a serum.
i don't care for tinted lotions so strike one against this
i got this on a set with the vitamin c serum
the sunscreen in this is unstable
t's often combined with other sunscreen ingredients
when it's combined with avobenzone
i highly recommend researching chemical sunscreen ingredients to learn more
i don't feel like it's super moisturizing
really wanted a sunscreen in my eye cream
love the truth serum though
i think this cream may be moisturizing because it reduces the creasing
this product only offered light moisturization.
it might be better used as a nighttime eye moisturizer
i prefer a balm cleanser or one that doesn't lather
this facial cleanser over stripped my skin.
i tried the citrus cleanser
decided to try the gentle cleanser because of the reviews
it is too strong for facial treatments
i only use eye lid serum
t's triple peptide eye cream
00 for a product that only adds moisturizer to your skin
any lotion can do this.
not hydrating at all
thought that this "hypoallergenic" product would be the answer
but i found my cold plasma face and love it
i did not find this eye cream moisturizing at all
didn't moisturize at all
i absolutely love the nutritive cleanser
there are times i use a moisturizer
this cream also has some ingredients that are skin irritants
4 other skin care products
this moisturizer is good
now using sheisedo infusing serum brightener.
i wear sunscreen every single day
my disdain with this product is that the bottle is a 4 oz bottle
i wanted to lighten them without using hydroquinone
i would put it on under my sunscreen
this one however is more than just an herbal
evelom cloth won't work well with this cleanser.
give my face acne
this much $ for a makeup remover?
when i cleanse it
i received samples of the thermal cleansing balm
no need for moisturizer
yes it removes the mascara
i enjoy clinique's cleansing balm
i generally think that cleansing balms are over priced for their purpose
the oily nature of the product is what makes it very moisturizing for your skin
maybe a mask or intense moisturizer?
i don't like this cleanser.
it is really occlusive
i received a sample of this thermal cleansing balm
i am a fan of cleansing balms having dry skin.
i used a makeup wipe after using this cleanser
so 3 stars for the cleanser.
rather that it is "unscented"
this is an okay cleanser
this cleanser stung my skin
tried this gentle cleanser
my acne is hormonal
when i finish my moisturizer
of anti-aging facial products
it made me feel like i was coating my face in cheap perfume
i did like their serum however
think i'll go back to retinol.
as i buy another moisturizer
the only problem i had with this moisturizer was that it was over moisturizing
it goes on like a serum
lots of hype about this moisturizer
i decided to give algenist overnight restorative cream a try
there are better moisturizers for the price.
for my night cream
contained no toxic chemical fragrance
tried this product along with the serum
"star score" to buy the restorative cream instead
i used with the serum.
so this sleeping mask does moisturize
it wasn't moisturizing enough
its like a regular moisturizer
even worse than my cheap aloe vera gel mask which u see instant brightening after 10min
this moisturizer quenched my skin overnight
use everything from their moisturizer to mascara
i like this night cream
thought this product would moisturize my skin while adding radiance
it does a good job of moisturizing
i prefer to use the serum at night instead
i've had no issues with any other clinique lotions
i don't like the fact the this cream has petrolatum in it
due to trying a new facial cleanser
i think a combination of the heavy fragrance
unscented product next time
(not certain waterproof mascara).
was looking to purchase the waterproof eye makeup remover
works well to remove all makeup with the exception of waterproof mascara
in the store to remove some liquid eyeliners
i tried using it instead as a morning cleanser since it's advertised as a no-rinse cleanser
a chance against waterproof eyeliner or mascara
such as waterproof mascara
although i would not recommend for waterproof mascara
especially for waterproof make up or when i wear multiple layers of mascara
i did notice my indereye moisturize
the radiance from the eye cream doesn't mix well with my concealer
i also dislike the texture of this product for the undereye
not for rosacea skin
not my favourite cleanser at all.
my skin is combination
i think foaming cleansers tend to dry out the skin
no amount of moisturizer would help.
i do get some pimples from stress or hormones
most of which are 7ml
while this bottle is 10ml
i applied it to a hormonal pimple for 5 days twice a day as directed
more of a mild acne so this is not for acne
this is a good moisturizer for hydrating
got this to replace my origins ginzing moisturizer
my acne got worse using this lotion probably because of the oils
this moisturizer just wasn't moisturizing enough
purchased the first aid beauty ultra repair cream which is wayyy more moisturizing
trust their natural ingredients
used ginzing energy booster moisturizer before
was an ok moisturizer.
le very rich moisturizers
i didn't find this to be moisturizing enough for me
i used it along with the plantscription serum
this product feels like regular moisturizer until applied
it was very moisturizing
i'd been using a drugstore serum that i loved
after trying this origins serum
my old serum made my skin feel firmer
this product causes a skin allergy reaction
i decided to only apply this serum on
it isn't as moisturizing as the 'belif moisturizing bomb' i used before using this product
if i don't add a moisturizer in my day
this cream is so hydrating
other moisturizer was making my face greasy
i remember that one being so-so with moisturizing
i believe in moisturizing my skin well at night
i hardly have a moisturizing effect at all.
it felt like a layer of oil/tackiness sitting on top of your skin without moisturizing it at all
as for my acne
apply my usual morning moisturizer
the oils in this cream will react with sunlight
tend to skip moisturizing my skin which has taken quite a toll on it
this did not feel moisturizing
where i applied this cream
as a moisturizing night cream not my favorite product
i prefer the checks and balances cleanser.
i wanted to try a different cleanser from origins for aging skin
i like the idea that this cleanser helps with free radicals
this cleanser does a good job of removing makeup
the fact that it has antioxidants
i like that this cleanser really purifies
my skin is combination
combination skin which is acne prone
i can also get that getting with an exfoliating face wash
even after using my normal daily moisturizer
just buy a hydrating mask.
it was paraben free
also feels really moisturizing initially
pros: this cream is hydrating
hydrating eye cream that doesn't cause any damage
this eye cream is great for moisturizing my dry under eyes
this eye cream is moisturizing
which was super moisturizing
while i don't have eye wrinkles i do like to moisturize with eye cream instead of facial lotion
this eye cream is moisturizing
i needed to moisturize asap
i don't have acne
did not work on inflammatory acne.
i feel like i need to apply moisturizer immediately after washing my face
i need a little more oomph to my facial cleanser
when i first bought this cleanser along with the toner
this cleanser doesnt state the percent of salicylic acid
bought this for hydration
giving away the other moisturizing ones
apricot kernel seed oil is considered comedogenic
i think this is an average hydrating face mask.
i would tell myself to get a bottle of aloe gel rather than getting this product
used it for a while as my nighttime moisturizer
it's super strong and almost medicinal, yuck!
i got a new moisturizer to helps moisturize my skin when i use this cleanser
the ingredients are recommended by my dermatologist which is why i want to pair it up with a really hydrating moisturizer
have to reapply or put the heavy duty moisturizer on those spots
while i realize this is a oil-free moisturizer
this moisturizer made it worse
on to the next moisturizer
i liked the medicinal smell
i personally love lightweight creams.
it seems that i bounce between moisturizers a lot
i wanted to like this moisturizer
opted to try out this origins lotion
my skin is combination
the texture is like a lotion
i also used clinique number 3 toner
the pink exfoliating mask
he has drier skin with acne so someone who is prone to dryness would need a more moisturizing formula
this gel moisturizer was just okay.
normally i use a moisturizer for 3+ months
the gel itself was not the most hydrating
and i love this cooling, gel texture on my skin.
doesn't give much of a moisturizing feeling
drunk elephant moisturizers as a replacement
i discovered that some of the ingredients are irritants to the skin
this hydrating gel i went through in a month
i love this moisturizer
this gel moisturizer didn't give me that feeling.
a better option is boscia's gel moisturizer.
i tried this gel.
not at all moisturizing!
i would use another moisturizer
i don't find this moisturizing enough for me
when i apply the primer i noticed that the gel
i do like how it hydrates
the moisturizer is very black
if you rub your skin once the moisturizer dries
the packaging is similar to kate somerville moisturizers
not moisturizing on combination skin
it made my mineral makeup crease
mostly from tanning for years
still have to use concealer as
just about any eye cream/lotion will be light
a rather expensive serum for my eyelids which began to sag
i find that using a "serum" does more for my skin than eye creams
dry weather is hyaluronic acid with no additives which hydrates
i think this lotion works okay.
i found ptr camus camus moisturizer to be effective sp when used in combination with the serum
this serum eradicated the dry
another reviewer commented that she thought that this serum contained a fair amount of silica
the product used to be referred to as an "exfoliant"
my routine is undereye cream
it works as other serums to moisturize my skin
helps moisturizer sink into my skin better
for some reason gel moisturizers do not sink in for me
i just don't do well with gel moisturizers
this moisturizer is great for daytime.
decided to try out this moisturizer
tried it as an overnight moisturizer
well it definitely is moisturizing
i need another moisturizer for the winter
this product has more of a gel consistency over a cream
i originally bought this after the clinique moisturizing gel wasn't doing enough for me in the winters
i normally use clinique moisture gel
unlike the gel version
the serum itself is overpriced
i didn't feel a difference using this serum.
although i haven't used any other type of facial serums i definitely have facial products that i'd prefer using over this one
i like this serum enough to finish up the bottle
it is a good serum
the top of this serum
it is mildly moisturizing
over hyped by derma rep.
serums are not supposed to be used alone for moisturizing the face
prepped for the next moisturizing product
no difference in hydration
that one does provide hydration benefits for my skin
this serum just didn't do it for me.
i religiously used this serum day
i faithfully followed the instructions for this serum with great hope
so their "facial expert" talked me into the perricone md eye lid serum
the only serum/treatment that has started to make a difference is sunday riley's
i like a serum to absorb
will stick with my deep wrinkle serum
from canada that makes a top quality eye serum
the skin under my eyes looks wrinkle-free immediately following the application while the serum is still moist
i put a thick layer of pure vitamin e oil on top of the serum for balance
i think that if i put vitamin e oil alone
asked for an eye serum that's the best for dark circles
i am not a fan of perricone cleansers or toners
it wasn't drying, but wasn't moisturizing either.
i already have a strong regimen using retinol around my eyes
looks good when applying serum
added this step before my cold plasma eye cream
the product has silicones
my skin just wouldn't drink this serum up
wanted to add a serum to wear under my daytime moisturizer
maybe because i like cream cleansers
removes all traces of makeup including mascara
this cleanser was ok.
i recommend the makeup breakup cleansing oil
for someone with acne
i needed to layer on another moisturizer
i will say that this product is moisturizing
the main ingredient is jojoba seed oil
it was very moisturizing
wanted a firming and lifting moisture cream .
need a serious antiaging product
it is a great non-greasy moisturizer though.
i used it with the matching serum from algenist
so you need to wear sunscreen during the day when you spend any time outdoors
my concealer would bunch up
didn't moisturise at all
love the lifting cream
moisturizers most of my face
this was one of the few cruelty free moisturizers in my sephora
this moisturizer is light-weight
i used this moisturizer for about a month before switching to a different moisturizer for better oil control
wanted to try a cream/gel situation for the summer
unfortunately i got the pomegranate toner
it is disappointing as a moisturizer.
it took me a while to realize that the oiliness was due to this moisturizer
due my acne medication
however i started having allergic reactions to the product
i do not recommend this moisturizer for sensitive skin or combination dry skin
this moisturizer felt like a lotion
started to peel like crazy- no amount of exfoliating/moisturizer would fix it
this cream works wonders
this product is hydrating
i love this nighttime facial !
if i put it over a serum
this is a good moisturizer
packaging alone is not efficacious for a vitamin c product
not really moisturizing or special enough to be worth it
it gives me a little moisturizer
i like this moisturizer a lot
cold weater to moisturize your skin
found glycerin is one of they key ingredients
i am allergic to some of the ingredients
super moisturizing but very heavily fragranced.
i love this cleanser
loyal customer of the ren cleansing balm
this would be a good option for a natural cleansing balm
aside from the serum pump bottle
i am a big fan of cleansing oils
goes on as a balm
this cleansing balm works well to remove makeup
used this cleansing balm as directed
my bronzer came up on it too
i usually use cleansing oils
if it can't even get bronzer off
how can it remove waterproof mascara??
have to use another cleanser to remove it
moisturizing on the skin
dark pigmentation or hydration
smells a bit like aerosol shaving foam
i solve that issue with moisturizer
wanted a treatment/serum to go along with it
i expected it to be a serum or lotion
a rep from ptr told me how amazing this serum is
the serum feels good on my skin
i got this in a kit with the toner
if prefer daytime because i use retinol every other night
no better than any other serum packed with peptides
i don't even have the "deep" wrinkles that this serum is supposed to treat
a few muaers have said that it's vitamin e smell
i've used vitamin e before
this cream is hydrating
face creams in our facility
thickness of this particular cream
prescribed by dermatologist to heal my face skin
after reaction to this cream i cannot use any cream for months
cream is as advertised
i prefer something thicker and more moisturizing.
i even take fermented cod liver oil for health
this pricey product does not moisturize
i got this as part of the value pack with the truth serum
i only use this at night to hydrate my skin after cleansing
i used it in combination with the truth serum
because i wanted to try the moisturizer with a brightening effect
i am a big fan of vitamin c products
typically use the ptr vitamin c line
a hint of vitamin c with something else
have used the truth serum
i don't know if its this creme or the serum
in my opinion this cream is not as good as the ole henriksen vitamin plus cream
definitely going back to the vitamin plus.
my journey to find my holy grail moisturizer continues
the truth serum for the past week
the truth serum lightened my dark spots
it's not as moisturizing as i would like
i received a sample of the vitamin c truth serum from sephora
the only downside to this moisturizer is the smell
i'd get more out of a tube of toothpaste.
this serum definitely helped control my oiliness throughout the day
i now use the multi-perfecting pore corrector gel moisturize by algenist
the serum was very moisturizing
this serum smells nice
the search for a good mattifying cream/serum continues :/
i put on tons of moisturizer
this is decently moisturizing
i tried it as an alternative to biotherme's aqua source gel moisturizer
do well with a gel-based moisturizer
it is not moisturizing either
this moisturizer does temporarily brighten your skin
the amino ag cream is better.
it does help with the puffiness.
this product contains menthol
some results on hyperpigmentation
amount is about 1/2 that in a chapstick tube
i don't have a problem with menthol
good moisturizer but is it a good wrinkle cream?
it smells like fabric softener or laundry detergent
i find this to be a nice daily moisturizer
and lastly it was not moisturizing for dry skin.
the search for the perfect moisturizer continues.
this illuminating moisturizer has a decent hydrating effect
very tacky serum which didn't do anything to moisturize my dehydrated skin
it's mostly alcohol and different fragrances.
unless your skin is on the dry side it is moisturizing enough
it does purify your skin
most creams irritate my skin
this cream kind of pampers the skin
the reality is--this is a cleansing foam
fragrance isn't cleaning your face
it didn't remove my sunscreen
the sunscreen does kind of help
i switched to this "lotion" version after having a freaky acne breakout brought on by stress
i chose this over the serum
even when mixed with a moisturizer
a vitamin c type serum
i prefer the de or josie moran facial oils
although this oil does hydrate my skin
i needed a night serum and decided to try this.
it does hydrate skin
result:- it is not hydrating
- the bottle leaks so you effectively lose a week's worth of serum- the product remains on the surface even though i exfoliate my skin regularly
hunt for a good serum begins again.
the good genes treatment
i love the theory behind this sunday riley juno transformative lipid serum -- i like that it has antioxidant properties
i feel like i've been slathering on a gross smelling $100 placebo lotion
maybe i'll try rinsing after 10-15 min
i believe it has been helping her acne prone skin :
i've had much better success with glycolic acid products
because of the lactic acid
this serum leaves your skin feeling hydrated
my skin usually loves lactic acid
so does the clinique gel moisturizer?
i've used many other types of exfoliating
put on moisturizer/spf
stung when i applied moisturizer with spf in it
a better cleanser than fresh soy face cleanser
the smell is so herbal
moisturizer i could still smell it
i still got my hormonal break out
it goes on almost like a serum.
i got a sample of the fresh soy cleanser which is like no more than 30 dollars
i see more results using a mild exfoliant
such as josie maran's exfoliant or peter thomas roth's strawberry scrub
as a cleanser, it does the job.
when i use my toner afterwards
this is not a cleanser.
my $12 cerave foaming cleanser is on par
i get good cleansers for less than 10$ at the drugstore
not the moisturizing cream for me.
got it for free as part of a kit with the laser focus serum
the clinique 7 day scrub
the dramatically different moisturizing lotion
until i switched out my exfoliating scrub for the 7 day scrub
the combo of the heavy lotion
i went back to my normal exfoliating scrub
i decided to start using murad cleansers
love the repairwear laser focus serum
i just saw it said retinoid
i think this is a very good moisturizing
the retinoids are a class of chemical compounds that are forms of vitamin a
i don't mind the dropper for dispensing the product
as i like to layer serums
was going to follow this serum with the moisturizer included in the pack
swear by the omega 3 overnight serum
not sure if i need a stronger retinoid product.
the quality of the ingredients
everything i've ever read about vitamin a
i love the omega night serum
i applied to each wrinkle
i prefer the algenist moisturizer
i like the consistency of the cream
the serum is good, but this does nothing.
it did nothing for moisturizing
this moisturizer is so nothing.
this moisturizer did not help
this moisturizer is very hydrating
i don't see it treating my acne.
silicone and acne products don't work together.
the acne-treating part stopped
my acne has cleared up by using a moisturizing face oil system
if you're experiencing adult acne
decided instead to use a regular hydrating moisturizer for my dry skin
cons: surprisingly greasy for an anti-acne moisturizer
but a moisturizer it was not!
has salicylic acid in it
including philosphy's miracle worker spf +50 moisturizer
i do use cleansers that have that ingredient in it
this moisturizer was okay
sometimes i need a treatment for acne
this product didn't help with my hormonal pimples at all
the product is so moisturizing
this is a fine lotion
it worked fine to moisturize
this moisturizer did hydrate well
i would massage it into my skin
i stopped using it because it wasn't moisturizing enough for my skin since i was
using a drying acne treatment
i mainly use this as a night creme after i do my heavy cleansing because it is so moisturizing
you have to slather on a lot of product for relief
the moisturizer does an ok job.
this is very moisturizing
it wasn't nearly moisturizing enough for my dry skin
i love gel eye masks
i applied an eye serum before i put this on
massaged in any excess serum to get the most out of the treatment
it did not moisturize
i don't have allergies
i got this in a ptr acne kit
then apply my moisturizer
i like the ptr glycolic toner wayyyyy more
this was listed under serums
thought it was for use like my other wrinkle treatment serums
retinol type products all the time
normally never use "acne" treatments
i just thought it was a serum like any other
i think it is the harsh acids
i don't have acne
this does not work on hormonal acne, just fyi.
went with the glycolic 10% hydrating gel instead.
i first tried this with the ptr acne kit
must pair it with the glycolic moisturizer otherwise it is ineffective
i've used the acne gel for years
this moisturizer has caused no reactions/breakouts
this lotion-gel isn't always hydrating enough
i also use the viz 1000 serum with this moisturizer
it is not heavy yet moisturizing.
this moisturizer is sorry!
the moisturizer does moisturize
nothing that separates it from other moisturizers
i used this as a night moisturizer
i saw a review on here for revision oil free hydrating serum
the product does the job as a moisturizer
i only apply before bedtime.
i used this under my makeup as an extra moisturizer
while it seemed to provide some moisturizing
it is about $9 for 4 oz
i went with the murad mattifying moisturizer that has a sunscreen
it doesn't have the best vitamin c in store either
i continue to use all the cold plasma products
i need products to be moisturizing to avoid wrinkles
i am sticking to my vit c serum instead.
any product that has vitamin c in it is going to have the benefits this product has
if you utilize a c gel under your moisturizer or sunscreen
it feels like an occlusive barrier on your skin
felt like it could of been a little bit more moisturizing
it is a moisturizing serum
this serum is heavily scented
i finished my bottle of the caudalie polyphenol defense serum
i plan on switching back to the defense serum.
so visited sephora to try out a serum
this serum did the opposite of what it claims to do
now i know that serums don't work overnight
cleansing milk in the morning
don't expect any miracles from this serum.
this is the first facial serum that creates pimples on my face within hours after application
they are very occlusive
this serum is not for you if you're dealing with acne breakouts
this is a very light weight serum.
for caudalie i prefer the vinexpert firming serum over this one for sure
my skin received no hydration from this product
which is a very effective formula to moisturize the skin
this produce did hydrate my skin when i applied it
it could honestly be labeled as a light-weight moisturizer
it is moisturizing, yes.
this is a great product to use for moisturizing all over if you don't mind the heavy scent that is included
ok i cannot get past the smell to the point that i cannot say how moisturizing
the oil itself is hydrating
it moisturizes the hair
emu oil as part of my evening skin care routine
i love face oils and oils to put on my skin.
i think the other fab creams do a better job of hydrating my skin
while it felt slightly moisturizing
this mask is supposed to be hydrating
moisturizing as i love some of the other products in the line
does help moisturize a bit
this mask isn't hydrating at all.
i promise that i have had better results using yogurt
i really love the ultra repair moisturizer
f you have truly sensitive skin stick with a pure form of colloidal oatmeal
my skin is combination
i think there are a lot of mattifying lotions out there that is half the price
i like the mattifying quality of the lotion.
had to switch to another lotion for nighttime
this product was not moisturizing at all whatsoever for me
on prescribed acne topicals
use my own designated sunscreen
this moisturizer is lightweight yet moisturizing.
i find that it's not as moisturizing as i'd like
i think the sorbet is more moisturizing than this heavier cream
i also know i was exfoliating
this was recommended to help with my skin redness
this was recommended to me as a night moisturizer
i am allergic to wheat
the riche was a thicker and more emollient cream.
you can drink tea
needed two eye creams or to use my moisturizer
can use it as a moisturizer
made my concealer blend even better
use your money for a good concealer.
it looked more like a concealer than a cream.
it isn't as hydrating
applicator is more hygienic than the pots
found it to be an undereye concealer that did not blend well with my skin
it made my mascara
it was still too moisturizing
i applied the cream 2x a day
not as moisturizing or effective as i would hope.
the tint in the cream is not enough to act as a concealer either
this is very moisturizing
i'd rather just change my diet
it's more of a concealer than brightening dark circles
i tried to mix with my moisturizer
was looking at some facial oils to blend with my nighttime moisturizers
i used it in combination w/fresh soy face wash
didn't seem to have any moisturizing properties at all
this stuff has been my holy grail for helping heal my hormonal acne
it didn't work as well as other moisturizing oils
this face oil is very moisturizing
only use it at night as a moisturizer
if using alone i would rather use my henricksen vitamin c serum which at least smells good
this may be another product that i am allergic to
this stuff claims it has retinol in it
all the good dermatologist br
this retinol is not for me
thinking about aging skin
isn't that what retinol is prescribed for at dermatologists?
i paired it with a oil free moisturizing serum to try to counteract the potentially drying effects of retinol
10/10 would not recommend for acne sufferers.
yes it was moisturizing
om acne at bay due to the exfoliation
even resorted to regular old calamine lotion
this serum absorbs really quickly
the fact that it has retinol
or it sprays all over
not with my acne
i am still on the search for the best blackhead remover
fyi: my skin type is combination that suffers from hormonal
sulfur is often used for hormonal outbreaks
tried every night faithfully for about 2 weeks after my serum
another heavy fragrance cream
as someone who wears sunscreen everyday
it is pure zinc oxide mixed with grannies perfume
there are better spf creams out there.
i am now using the rest as a décolletage moisturizer
i like using this as a nighttime face moisturizer
i do tend to like unscented lotions
for a "creme" that retails for 200 bucks
this moisturizer was recommended by vib rouge concierge
prefer creams to gels and found it ineffective.
for the price of this dior moisturizer
feels like it hydrates your skin when you apply
the new bottle is much more emollient
it does leave a little orangey tint to your face right after application from just the high levels of vitamin c
regardless the amount of alcohol in this serum is too irritating for all skin types including my skin
nothing special about the serum to report.
when it came time to get a new serum
she game me a free sampler after i decided on this serum
i will continue my search for a better vitamin c serum
i needed a serum that helps with my dehydrated complexion
you can't expect vitamin c results by splashing oj on your face
get a real vitamin c serum
this one is not so much a gel-like serum
just a runny pure-liquid serum
this serum feels and smells great!
instead of this i got a vitamin c skin boost from the vitamin shop for $26
the serum does brighten
i tried both the serum
thought my sunscreen had run in my eyes
some minuses: it isn't deeply moisturizing
i'd be better off with moisturizer and concealer.
i like their greek yogurt overnight face mask
i will try samples of eye creams before committing to a full tube
the product is hydrating
eye serum -same line which i've been using for a while
not moisturizing enough for me
it was very moisturizing
it is pretty moisturizing however
yl alcohol as an ingredient
nothing moisturizing about it for my dry skin.
it contains glyceryl stearate se
if you don't mind/like silicone feeling moisturizers
the consistency was perfect for a daytime moisturizer
i love the packaging of this lotion.
it surely wasn't ultra moisturizing
i used it along with the fab serum
i used it daily under my tinted moisturizer for 2 weeks
no spf protection is a miss for me on this moisturizer
i like this moisturizer because i have oily skin
i feel like it is not moisturizing enough
this "moisturizer" is super watery
at times i wanted something a bit more moisturizing
smells exactly like ultra hydrating moisturizer by simple so why pay double?
even with a hydrating serum underneath
nowhere near moisturizing enough
you'd have to use it with the ultra hydrating serum for it to be enough hydration
it wasn't moisturizing enough
my aloe vera plant was more moisturizing.
fab's hydrating serum has been perfect
this face moisturizer did not help with moisturizing my face at all
have to use another lightweight moisturizer in addition to this
at least it moisturizes.
i loved the packaging of this moisturizer
had to discontinue using this moisturizer
the search for the right moisturizer continues...
this moisturizer didn't help at all.
this moisturizer was recommended to me in store for my sensitive skin
i did not find product this moisturizing at all
this is supposed to be very moisturizing
it balances being light and being moisturizing.
i suggest finding another moisturizer with no alcohol
it's a good basic moisturizer
this lotion was good.
i will continue the search for a good moisturizer
i don't find this product to be particularly moisturizing or soothing to my sensitive skin
this did not moisturize my skin at all
mixing it with argon oil
also hydrates my skin
this product does a good job moisturizing
i wanted to love this moisturizer
find another vitamin c product if you don't have the tools to break in
whether i use it alone or with the rx retinol
i love the scent of this moisturizer
definitely moisturizers my skin
hydrated like any moisturizer
drying a serum on my face
i used this moisturizer to complete my routine
i started using the moisturizer as part of the kit with the camu camu serum
almost like mini acne
this moisturizer was a miss for me
the serum a try because i felt my skin was looking a little dull
it is a good moisturizer
i got this moisturizer to help with slight dryness
looks like i'm on the hunt for a new vitamin c cream now as well
it is very moisturizing
combined with the toner
and it's not moisturizing or hydrating.
the accompanying toner a try
even microdermabrasion hasn't worked
it also has a medicinal smell which produced a sort of "skunky" odor when combined with my normal skincare products
is a really harsh phyiscal exfoliant
if your skin can tolerate physical exfoliation you may enjoy it
exfoliating my problem areas that are both oily
moisturizers are absorbed well
chemical exfoliating is best for me.
quick exfoliant for combination/normal skin
i am not new to exfoliating masks
it does a better job at exfoliating
exfoliation i got with this mud mask
i don't think it's moisturizing enough for my under eye area
i love the applicator
i really loved the genifique facial serum
as it came with the new lancome gel moisturizer
didn't irritate like regular genifique serum.
i did not care for the viscosity of the product
i don't see the point of the applicator
the serum leaves my eye area feeling tacky
it is a very watery serum
leaving no moisturizing effects whatsoever
deposits way too much serum for the eye area
light moisturizer for acne-prone skin
no change in hydration
i did not have glowing skin nor did i find it very moisturizing
it pills when i try to rub it in
if you plan on using this product as a daily moisturizer after your a
facial skin care regimen
i used this product as my primary moisturizer
i received the sk-ii facial lift emulsifier to try for free through sk-ii
i wanted to love this sk-ii facial lift emulsion so much
i prefer skii facial treatment cleansing oil over this product
it's moisturizing without any fragrance.
i noticed that the facial treatment essence really helps reduce redness
it's an ok moisturizer.
it was just an average moisturizer
for some reason the serums clog my pores
it had triclosan in it
it does remove my makeup except for mascara.
not much better than a facial oil cleanser from the drug store
i used it like any cleanser
i only use at night because i prefer a lighter moisturizer during the day
is it a day cream?
i prefer unscented or lightly scented.
overall i would prefer a lighter serum consistency with a cleaner scent
for my under makeup moisturizer
i tend to need creams with more hydration in addition to oil-based ingredients
i applied the serum daily for several weeks in the mornings after cleansing
i’m assuming the breakouts were due to the serum
but it isn't very moisturizing.
the gel serum goes on smoothly
so the moisturizing effects are working however for the high retail price i will likely stick to my regular moisturizer
i got the serum about a month
the serum does moisturize like it says it does
i can say that this serum has helped keep my skin hydrated
wondering if this is supposed to be used like a serum under a cream?
this is a nice serum that immediately hydrates the skin
even though it was moisturizing
but just an average hydrating serum.
choose a more moisturizing cream that's cheaper like loccitane
i started using sk-ii brightening clear lotion after washing
i would recommend this cream as a moisturizer to protect skin
i do fell like it moisturizers
the only difference i've notice is that my under eye area feels moisturized when i use this in the morning before applying concealer
moisturizes the eye area
after using a great many eye creams
it really is more cream than lotion
i also like that it leaves the eye area moisturizing
the cleanser will do what this mask treatment does
extra hydrating for winter
i liked this moisturizer.
the hunt continues for a moisturizer that controls redness
it's definitely not as moisturizing as i would have liked
even for a nighttime moisturizer
the benefit moisturizer is more suited for winter
the last time a lotion tingled on my face was a tanning lotion
it's not terrible when it comes to moisturizing
pros: i've tried moisturizers in the past that had faint chemical smells to them
it does a great job at moisturizing
it's great for moisturizing combination skin
i used this as a nighttime moisturizer
i don't wear any foundation or concealer.
if you are careful while applying the concealer
i love the anthony glycolic cleanser
one of the points really caught my eye "moisturizing face oil to quench dry skin
after about five minutes i can apply serum no problem
compared to the prices of other popular facial oils
this oil is good for moisturizing the body.
it is mostly unscented which is nice.
love to rub it on after my moisturizer to give my skin an extra boost of hydration
i mix it with my moisturizer
i like that the cream is spf 15
after a few weeks of use it seems not very moisturizing
like all eye creams
it nice and moisturizing around the eye area.
this looked like a cream but applied like a gel.
i needed aneye cream that would moisturize
it isvery moisturizing even the next morning
i prefer non scented face lotions
heat i like to use lightweight moisturizers on my face
face creams with smells are ok
sometimes get hormonal acne
it was a good temporary moisturizer
hydrating face lotion for my normal to dry skin
every time i applied this moisturizer
my skin is not acne-prone
this cream has no dermatologist-recommended or tested anti-aging ingredients
the vitamin e broke me out around my cheeks
be careful if your skin doesn't react well to vitamin e oil
i don't have acne prone skin
i decided to invest in a quality moisturizer
i don't feel it has much of a moisturizing effect
its preventative, not restorative.
as i use the fresh cleanser
i loved this moisturizer at first
i would not choose this moisturizer
my skin is combination
it was moisturizing, but that's about it.
retinol/retinoids can be drying
was using a moisturizer afterwards
then i found out that although retinol or retinoids can be good for the rest of your face
it also acts as a primer to keep my foundation/concealer in place
i loved all the other moisturizers from miracle worker line
i like this cream.
does a lovely job of moisturizing my under eye area
i took care to moisturize while using it
the retinoid in this product
the hydrating power of the cream
was hoping this would be a lesser alternative to botox or other $100 creams
possibly too high a retinoid for my skin.
i wasn't going to live on allergy pills just to use an eye cream
it was hard to apply concealer after applying
i don't recommend using this product under your makeup as it made my foundation/eye concealer separate on my skin
i don't see any beneficial effects from the retinoids
hydrating moisturizers work better than this stuff
maybe it was the retinol
i also thought retinol was supposed to help with wrinkles
used philosophy's miraculous anti-aging retinoid eye repair cream
i am either allergic to them
have allergic reaction to it :
the flaking isn't so bad if i pair the product with a hyaluronic serum
moisturizing cream at first
i decided to get a sample of day/night anti-wrinkle retinol cream
acne combo that i have
that sometimes retinol takes a while to work
i don't feel like it is actually moisturizing
for the amount of money for this moisturizer.
moisturizer all over after i apply
i found that this product did hydrate my skin
like it as a moisturizer though
it isn't quite moisturizing enough for my skin
which is acne prone
in the morning with sunscreen
or as a night cream
i find this moisturizer to be more irritating to my skin versus "perfecting"
it just wasn't moisturizing my skin at all
it has salicylic acid in it
i switched up the moisturizer
idate for this type of moisturizer
as i am applying my makeup it starts peeling off with the moisturizer
ordering the algenist moisturizer i had been using
i like the serum
i used this in combination with the matching moisturizer
i already exfoliate on a regular basis
was given a bunch of serum
moisturizer samples to help with the pore-size-problem
got the full size of the serum
the reconstructing serum worked a lot better with my pores
i saw it had glycerin in the ingredients
just gushing over this serum
the regular ferulic acid + retinol brightening solution
it was gloopy versus like a serum
or maybe it was a placebo
if you use a retinol gel or cream like i do
i think the extra retinol from this eye serum is too much
with concealer on top of it
before i started using undereye concealer
because of ravings over the wonders of retinol for reducing wrinkles
heard i would need to ease my skin into using retinol
got a "gentler" moisturizing anti-wrinkle cream instead
even my algenist eye cream couldn't overcome the drying caused by this serum
i know retinol products only show results over time
it needs a moisturizing cream on top which is a little ridiculous with the price of the bottle
i used this eye serum every morning
i know retinol is great for my skin
this serum just felt like putting gel under my eyes
was hoping this serum would both correct
lip serum had a better feel anyways
maybe something more moisturizing or something that will fill i the wrinkles to keep them from creasing even more
only thing is does is moisturize
it is moisturizing though.
it really is so moisturizing
it rolled with my moisturizer
i like my moisturizer
while it was moisturizing
hydrating is the only claim i would agree with
i'd put your money to good quality concealer
it is very moisturizing!
it is still moisturizing
t makes my concealer crease
it dose moisturize but i didn't see any brighten
if you need a moisturizing cream that is safe for eyelids
this eye cream is hydrating
it gets two starts because it is moisturizing
it is fairly moisturizing
i wish it was a bit more moisturizing.
use the daily moisturizer
i usually use liquid face oils
with a regular exfoliation followed by josie maran argon infiniti cream oil my fine line
so will cheaper lotions
i didn't find this creamy oil super hydrating
i found great results with the argan milk
expected this to be very moisturizing
not moisturizing, doesn't soothe chapped lips.
it doesn't hydrate my skin
the crème itself was a miracle
got this moisturizer as a gift.
bought the serum which works better
the moisturizer is lucious
the only good thing is that it's moisturizing
this is not moisturizing at all
it's hydrating and light weight.
i also like to moisturize my eyes overnight.
it is a nice unscented
moisturizing cream that doesn't burn or sting my eyes
the repairwear laser focus serum is a total waste too
having tried the moisture surge moisturizer a couple of times
i really like how moisturizing this is
a little went a long way in terms of moisturizing
this isn't a miracle cream
it aggravates my rosacea
it did do a good job of moisturizing my face
it moisturizes my face
it was an overnight hydrating mask after all
this cream is so hydrating!
i loved it at first it did a great job at moisturizing
more of a lotion than a cream
lavender isn't recommended for the skin
a lightweight sunscreen on the thinner side.
i like how absorbent
it was moisturizing enough
there are some moisturizers that make my skin look
it feels like nothing more than a sunscreen
it did not feel moisturizing
got the jane maran sunscreen
i tried this as a recommendation for a lightweight moisturizer with spf protection
i've used more moisturizing products for a lower price
i don't think it's as moisturizing as some others i've tried
it does't seem overly moisturizing though
i did not find it moisturizing at all
this moisturizer wasn't hydrating enough
smells more like a sunscreen than a moisturizer
as i started applying the moisturizer on my face i had an overwhelming smell of e
using only this moisturizer i was seeking more moisture
i wanted to like this moisturizer
the self-defense vital antioxidant moisture spf 30 i had to return because of the smell
especially notable since it includes sunscreen
boscia oil-free daily hydration spf 15
it is not moisturizing at all.
this product did not moisturize at all!!
this chia serum did not moisturize my skin at all
this was not as moisturizing for me as i thought it would have
this moisturizer does not moisturize at all
did not provide any extra moisturizing or antiaging
it smells like medicine a dermatologist would prescribe
out of the moisturizing masks
this product is definitely a heavy moisturizer.
had to switch it to my night time moisturizer
i found that this product is not hydrating at all
i also add a few drops to my bath for extra moisturizing benefits
naturally google said it was hormonal
give my skin some hydration
it goes on like other facial oil products.
for my combo skin type
which scientific research shows is bad for your skin when used topically
that makes pure camellia japonica oil with no additives
it is so moisturizing
its extremelly hydrating which i love
from all the claims i agree that it is hydrating
so my go to night moisturizer has been sesame seed oil
since this says its packed with antioxidants yadda yadda
i realized its not very moisturizing at all
ultimately my skin needed something more moisturizing
mixed with my moisturizer
it's recommended to use cream cleansers
origins organic foaming cleanser cleans much better than this
i really like the serum in this line of products
hoping it would be a great cleanser/makeup remover
i tried this serum for 3 days & nights.
enjoyed the texture of this serum
i saw no benefits out of this serum unfortunately
i did not notice a difference in my skin when i added this serum to my beauty routine
it's not that moisturizing
i like the smell of this facial gel
i found it not moisturizing enough for the weather in toronto
i do recommend using with josie argan oil!
as someone who is allergic to yeast
gel moisturizer with a nice fragrance
i tried on a sample of the rose hydrating gel cream
use two different topicals
it didn't moisturize my face all day
this gel cream is too greasy
the gel cream is fine
i prefer lotus youth preservative
i also love gel cremes
while this moisturizer goes on smooth
i found that this contains synthetic color
i've never experienced this with a moisturizer before
feels more like a serum before a real moisturizer
i like moisturizing my face with something lightweight
thinking it would be moisturizing
the moisturizer is definitely hydrating
when i think of you moisturizer
do not try cosmetics with rose extract
i tried this product as a replacement for the soy face cream which i really liked
this moisturizer sits on top of my skin
it is pretty moisturizing but it's not oil-free.
first thing this is not a cream at all its a gel type moisturizer with no creamy feel at all
it did not moisturize my skin at all
it does a good job of moisturizing
it's not moisturizing enough
when i do wear makeup it is important to use a make up remover cloth before using the cleanser
buy my soy face cleanser
i really like the moisturizer
the toner is okay
this cleanser is a bit to light in texture
this foam cleanser is not as hydrating as i imagine
like the soy cleanser
love fresh soy cleanser too
i am thinking of purchasing the rose hydrating gel
i think the soy cleanser is much better.
i love fresh's soy cleanser.
i realize that the soy cleanser states that it does
this product no doubt is moisturizing
stick with the original truth serum!
the oil is moisturizing
i coupled this product with their truth serum.
am a lover of the truth serum
i massaged the product in
it did moisturizer my skin
saw no benefit from this serum
it's the facial oil equivalent of crisco.
cleanser remover wipes all the time
i am going to have to bleach it out of my pillowcases
i realllyyy did because of how much i adore the vitamin c serum
especially if i apply it a few minutes after serum
started to use it as a makeup remover
combined with the serum
love the truth serum
it didn't feel moisturizing or brightening
it was less hydrating
i don't find it all that moisturizing
i am a contact lens wearer and cannot have this.
i usually love shiseido eye creams
this is a nice rich moisturizing
it does moisturize to an extent
oil-free moisturizer enriched with active vitamin d that enhances radiance with antiaging
this was sold to me as a daily moisturizer.
i wanted a self-tanning face moisturizer.
i know self-tanning moisturizers can have a funky smell
self tanner don't mix well
i absolutely loved this from a moisturizing
why a vitamin c serum wouldn't be in a pump
and it feels lightly moisturizing.
the only vitamin c in here is ascorbic acid
will be buying another vitamin e serum
not a pump as vitamin c serums can go bad quickly the more they are exposed to air
my dermatologist recommended adding a vitamin c serum to my daily regimen
i gave this product 1 star because it sort of moisturizes
as most of the vitamin c products are pricey
i wasn't impressed with the short lasting moisturizing power
i love this as a summer moisturizer
i think i will stick with my gel moisturizer with hylaronic acid
the origins ginzing moisturizer is reported to be a gel moisturizer although it's a white cream when you look at it
for an energizing moisturizer meant to be used in the morning
moisturizer for my skin type
i like a more lightweight moisturizer for my eye cream
this moisturizer felt light
need vitamin c or retinol in my moisturizers
i normally use clinique moisturizing cream because i have very dry skin
i wish it had sunscreen in it.
like the detox exfoliator
the pore refining moisturizer
i applied the cream
retinol is the anti-aging ingredient that works for me
feels like a greasy moisturizer
i could use this as a daytime moisturizer
its moisturizing properties lasted several days i swear
i noticed that the regular greek yoghurt moisturizer disappeared for a while
love products like this that claim it's super moisturizing
i ordered this because i used to use a korres greek yoghurt daily moisturizer
this product is deeply moisturizing
didn't cause me to break out like many deeply moisturizing treatments do
it felt like any other moisturizer
i do notice a difference when i use a moisturizer at night
acne prone skin i decided to stop using it
i love face oils
sadly it still was not moisturizing enough
i wouldn't recommend for acne-prone skin
exfoliating prior to every application
smells like coppertone sunblock mixed with geranium extract
they moved the preservatives
this moisturizer made my face greasy
as a moisturizer its good
i like the texture of this moisturizer
the rep at the store could not recommend a moisturizer that was both mattifying
it's not moisturizing enough for me.
this lotion leaves a tacky finish that makes applying mineral makeup difficult
don't recommend it unless you use liquid foundation or bb creams
compared with other moisturizers i've tried
one of the more expensive moisturizers i've tried from sephora
it is too expensive for the purpose of moisturizing when it just doesn't work
this moisturizer is spf 30
acne after just one use
heavy to be used as a daytime moisturizer
which tends to happen with face creams with spf
not for a moisturizer as i use the finishing moisturizer which i love
wouldn't say its moisturizing
even though it is a super emollient cream
i needed a good moisturizer for my combo skin
its like any other moisturizer with spf in it.
this moisturizer did a great job of replenishing my skin
not any more than a basic serum
i will say a big plus is that it is pretty moisturizing
serum made my face feel sticky
it may be the fragrance or extra chemicals.
i know it was the serum
because i only put the serum on my wrinkles
when i quit using the serum
just got botox for my wrinkles
although i still used moisturizer
my regular serum that i use i see more results with
i liked the texture of this serum
this would be a great serum to keep skin looking youthful
then i discovered grapeseed oil
modestly moisturize -- no smoothing or radiance
the nutrient complex has a lot of good vitamins
i didn't find it moisturizing
no radiance or hydration.
the repairative moisturizer from this line
both do a fantastic job moisturizing my skin
there are many many moisturizers, cleansers etc.
this facial moisturizer is nothing special.
i've gone through a few moisturizing masks/sheet masks trying to correct my skin
had an allergic reaction to it
enjoyed the feeling of the mild exfoliant
a basic exfoliator does that
was excited to try a tata harper moisturizer given the emphasis on natural ingredients
moisturizer throughout the day
because of the natural ingredients
i wanted to like this moisturizer
it is not moisturizing
this is not a very moisturizing moisturizer.
must apply heavy serum or oil beneath it to stay moisturized throughout the day
this cleanser is ok
my skin feels dry after i apply this lotion
overpriced, and not moisturizing enough.
i will keep use tarte maracuja oil
borghese state of the art mascara
the beads in this cleanser are not the best for daily use
i love that it has natural ingredients
i think my biggest issue with this is the exfoliating beads
would not recommend for everyday if your skin is irritated by physical exfoliation
so my skin is sued to exfoliation
this cleanser was recommended as a daily cleanser
would have been better if i needed a twice/week exfoliant
as it is both a cleanser
an exfoliant in one i decided to give it a try
then use this just for the exfoliating properties
enzyme peel daily to exfoliate
it is a light exfoliation for everyday use as it claimed
/or sunscreen in the evening
this is a pricey cleanser
i love the fact that it's a cleanser/ exfoliant
stop using fragrance even if "natural"
the product is very milky and does exfoliate.
it does exfoliate existing acne
this is nice cleanser with grains in it to help gently exfoliate
which is a great bonus for a facial cleanser
even with using top clean ingredients is just too much for a daily exfoliating cleanser
i loved facial moisturizers with a hint of scent instead of unscented
because many times the unscented has a medicinal smell
this serum was way too strong
that was until i tried this serum.
it smells like fertilizer !
this serum is a good weight to layer under moisturizer in the winter
it stays greasy including overnight or even using after exfoliating
the fragrance smells herbal/medicinal
reminds me of the all natural products used for facials
it also reminds me of facial creams my gr
which was a combination of camphor
since this is just a serum
i checked the ingredients
various useless botanical extracts
not moisturizing at all
it didn't help moisturize the skin
i don't like the applicator
a chilled chamomile tea bag works better
i hoped that this would reduce allergy induced puffiness
rew weil for origins™ mega–bright skin illuminating cleanser
this was an ok moisturizer
didn't do anything in terms of moisturizing my skin
i like the light lotion like texture
this cleanser does the job
more of a debrasion that cream wash
how can they put sparkle in a cleanser
figure out how to formulate it with parabens
i like the smell of this moisturizer
i wanted to love this moisturizer
it contains ingredients that cause acne.
i think this is a solid moisturizing oil
i don't recommended for combination skin
this was not moisturizing
appeared to be a classic reliable serum
don't like that such a pricy serum comes in a plastic bottle
this serum is on the market for a very long time
i am defiantly seeing more results over another serum i was using
advanced night eye serum
serum moisturizer eye cream=$38
this serum works wonders.
although it's a "night" serum
i think adding this serum to my beauty routine helped reduce some dark spots on my face as well
this serum broke my skin out so bad.
this serum is really not for everyone.
i think this serum is too rich for younger skin
the product was not moisturizing at all.
not like typical oils/serums
this is the most moisturizing serum i have tried.
i am on the fence with this serum
i am currently using a retinol treatment
the serum is very light creamy.
my issue with it, not moisturizing enough.
i put this on under my moisturizing regimen.
despite what the directions say i actually prefer it over the moisturizer because the silicones lock in the moisture
estée lauder has another serum that is for lifting that will actually tighten your pores
in conjunction with a good exfoliation will achieve everything this product claims to do
not enough spf for a daytime moisturizer so additional sunscreen is needed
felt kind of like i put to much sunscreen on my face
don't need sunscreen was mistake number one
i only wear it during the day because of the sunscreen
i hate how there is spf in the moisturizer
i dont find this moisturizing at all -- it just sits on my face
had to mix with lotion and use on hands.
next day had allergy to moisturizer with sunscreen
you would think especially a serum over the st
the serum has a nice texture
i find the product nicely moisturizing
since i also use a moisturizer
it is by no means a moisturizing eye cream !
advanced night eye serum
serum moisturizer eye cream=$38
doesn't do anything apart from moisturizing
this eye cream wasn't moisturizing enough
i am 51 with combination skin
i feel that it's not moisturizing enough
it does make putting concealer on my undereye smoother
advanced night eye serum
serum moisturizer eye cream=$38
this eye cream is moisturizing and tightening.
it works okay as a cleanser
before it was a combo cleanser/mask
i prefer the original argan oil
i need a new moisturizer
it helps my acne
i like thicker moisturizers at night
not for winteri had to return however the product range does have other more emollient moisturizers
i like using micellar water as regular cleanse
use it after your cleanser as a toner
using too many serums or moisturizers on top can get sticky
this cleansing water is just that
only use it at night as a toner
this is good as a gentle remover or toner after a main cleanser
ok for removing mascara.
i think this would be better if it was treated just as a cleaning toner
i love micellar waters.
i tried using it as the gym cleanser
it's sold as a soap-free makeup removing cleanser
to me this item is more of a toner.
i remove my makeup with oil cleanser or balm
it also contains fragrance
which i remove with caudalie's moisturizing toner
i just wear a nickle sized amount of a lightweight tinted sunscreen
it won't remove two coats of mascara fully.
i used this from the sephora collection of cleansers
i wear no makeup to my derm appts.
caudalie's premier cru elixir oil only.
after my facial injections
good for after washing your face for extra hydration under lotion
does not remove my waterproof mascara
not hydrating at all.
i think it was due to the echinacea.
although i do admire it's moisturizing properties
it is quite moisturizing
it wasn't very moisturizing
felt like i was putting on sunscreen
the oily formula loaded with detergents
decided to buy this moisturizer
i love clinique moisture surge
an oldie basic moisturizer.
i like the moisturizing gel much better.
toning my skin both in the morning
research the ingredients in this product
like a gas like chemical scent
i find that i have to literally bathe in this product to hydrate my skin
i started using this moisturizer because i ran out of my usual moisturizer
i used this after the clinique foamy acne solution cleanser
i've tried numerous clinique lotions
i only use it mixed with other lotions at night
while this will moisturize your face
i would rather use any old drug store moisturizer
this works well as a brightener
i love benefiance line, and their serums.
bought this for moisturizing
i don't feel that it is moisturizing nor does it correct my under eye lines
this eye cream is not as good as other shiserdo eye creams
it has a light texture that is more hydrating than moisturizing
found this moisturizer very light to wear
i don't recommend buying this since it not moisturizing at all
one of the makeup artists "highly recommended" this moisturizer for oily skin
that it was a lightweight moisturizer
the night time moisturizer
turns out it was this moisturizer
it smells like a mix of sunscreen
it smelled just like kids sunscreen
not as moisturizing as i would like for winter
i am currently using the first aid beauty ultra repair cream as a day moisturizer
i find this moisturizer ok.
i just wanted a facial moisturizer
i like the cleanser
wasnt a big fan of the moisturizer
it feels like a sunscreen lotion when you have it on
i found this to be too moisturizing for my skin
i feel like it did an average job of moisturizing
calming a little redness after cleansing
this moisturizer probably contri
it just moisturizes my face
it was probably the fragrance in the cleanser.
when i apply this moisturizer at night
like every other moisturizer i've tried
i think its a great moisturizer for normal skin
i like the boscia purifying cleanser a thous
the texture is more like a serum
i also really dislike the greasiness of this moisturizer
i think i'll stick with my regular face moisturizer
dont get me wong-its very moisturizing.
believing that this light-weighted moisturizer would be perfect for my combination/oily skin
if a version of this was made that was totally unscented
just like their refining moisturizer
the smell of this moisturizer is so strong you think this is a perfume
ordered this after cleanser
the fragrance in this lotion is too strong for my h
i also purchased the shiseido ibuki refining moisturizer enriched
small exfoliating benefits on acne
i tried using this to help with the few bits of hormonal acne i would get around my menstrual cycle
lightly exfoliating pads that are saturated with liquid
i think my skin responds better to benzoyl peroxide as an active ingredient instead of salicylic acid
i much prefer my purity cleanser.
i've tried a lot of different cleansers
there aren't that many beads in this cleanser to call it an exfoliator
when comes time to rinse
i hate that feeling when i rinse off a cleanser.
i don't know how everyone is raving about how weightless this serum is
i should have just went for one of the sephora serums that actually have proven antioxidants that impact skin positively
with no antioxidants or whatsoever.
better serum for every skin type
the first ingredient is mineral oil.
may buy those to use with another cleansing balm
my combination skin does really well with oil cleansers
assuming this was a detox period or something
it wasn't a detox period
after cleansing i used my erno laszlo toner
it's the only toner in the house
followed by the eve serum
it was very exfoliating
i love a good exfoliating product.
the first ingredient is mineral oil
very thick snd emollient
i tried using it for facial cleansing massages
i can achieve better results using coconut oil to oil cleanse
why another natural oil like argon or coconut oil could not be used in place of mineral oil?
i loved this product until i did some research on lanolin
one of the main ingredients in this cleanser
this cleanser contains lanolin
from fresh's soy to shu uemura's cleansing oils
am not allergic to mineral oil
now, about 75% of my cleansers are balms or oils.
i prefer lighter cream cleansers
the big deal about mineral oil or paraffin is that it's a by-product of petroleum
mineral oil is pure
need to use a heavy duty moisturizer after removing this mask
i am a fan of eve lom night time cleansing balm
it is herbal scented
even after a thorough rinse
i wish that this product was unscented because it would definitely be my go-to cleanser
did not exfoliate or properly cleanse my skin
i noticed this formula was changed from gentle foaming cleanser to creamy cleanser
this is more of a cream cleanser
definitely not a foaming cleanser
i usually like cream cleansers
love the verso serums
is more like a cleansing cream
i don't use foundation or powder
after using this with the verso serum for 2-3 days
the day cream didn't really upset my skin until i added the serum
so first impressions: it smells a bit like old sunscreen
then clearasil 24hr acne serum to keep my face from getting too oily
it is a thick lightweight cream, but not a serum.
only use the serum at night
considering how expensive this serum is
will be returning this serum
using at night after exfoliating .
when i started noticing the dryness i began using a moisturizing cream over it
i've tried dozens of under-eye creams
because of this i have to use under eye concealer every day
i think the retinol
turmeric extract would work on my eyes
starting on a more hydrating eye cream
i struggle to find appropriate daytime eye creams
it's not moisturizing at all
under/over any eye cream/face cream/sunscreen
it isn't that hydrating
since it contains zinc oxide
this did nothing to lighten my hyperpigmentation.
i'll admit i didn't use any sunscreen when using this product
this does not work at all without sunscreen
i am allergic to sulfates
i wonder if it's the parabens.
however the products still contain parabens
this night cream s not as moisturizing as the sheer day cream
i must follow with a toner
after washing my face with this cleanser
this is really not an exfoliating cleanser either
i am used to using the essential c cleanser
it's just basic aloe
i feel like i'm putting aloe vera on my face.
helps with some of the redness
am currently on "belif true cream moisturizing bomb
fresh-cut aloe vera from my garden
i feel like i might as well use aloe
the pros: it is hydrating
i think a very hydrating moisturizer
i feel like this is a more expensive aloe vera gel
aloe could have the same thing for a fraction of the price
aloe vera honestly works better.
expensive aloe vera gel on your skin
no intense hydration or "detoxification"
to be honest it doesn't feel any different from cucumber aloe gel you apply after being in the sun
moisturizes while it's on the skin
it felt like i was applying a version of aloe vera that was less sticky
thought i'd use it in replace of my usual mask after exfoliating
it says that it hydrates
helped to reduce redness after an intense enzyme peel
the cucumber cleanser is holy grail
don't waste your money, buy aloe.
the only reason i got this cleanser as it said it is 3 in cleanse
i do not ever use facial cleanser it to remove eye m/u except cleansing oil
i am a strong believe in using an oil treatment as a moisturizer
" which were under control thanks to sephora's renewing serum
had high hopes this would be my moisturizing solution
the esthetician said the dilo oil would basically trick my sebaceous gl
i also like the slight medicinal herbal scent.
face with lots of moisturizer
i used this cream together with the ceramidin lotion
this combination was not moisturizing enough for me unfortunately
i picked this up as a 100-point reward because i love another drugstore lotion that contains ceramides
which is strange considering it's supposed to be a moisturizing product
better hydrating serums out there
the issue that denatured alcohol is one of the first ingredients
did not moisturize at all.
couldn't even uses it long enough to see if it was moisturizing
this combination was not moisturizing enough for me unfortunately
got this as a light moisturizer
pepper like an expensive spa
i found it has denatured alcohol
still searching for the holy grail of moisturizers
after reading the amazing reviews i thought this was going to be my holy grail serum along with the cream
didn't even feel moisturizing upon initial application
i will be returning this for something more moisturizing
invest in a different moisturizer
does not provide moisturizing
so a pre-serum then a serum
the ingredients caused redness
it contained lavender extract
i enjoy some of their serums/moisturizers
even with my origins moisturizer
this cleanser has an almost toothpaste-like thickness
which is known for decades to have made whitening products for the asian market
sits on my skin, even after toning, or a serum.
love the smell of this moisturizer
when i removed this moisturizer from my routine
i definitely found it to be more moisturizing than fresh youth preserve
other moisturizers i have tried
i think the is a ok moisturizer
the moisturizer in this package
wanted a "light-weight" moisturizer
it's a wonderful moisturizer in that it is very moisturizing
unnecessary for a facial moisturizer
would be fine as a night moisturizer
who doesn't love peptides?
this moisturizer does go on heavy
i will continue to use it as a moisturizer
will add another serum to help with lines
this cream is light
no way would i spend 150 on the serum
the serum goes a long way
it is a thin serum
t isn't really moisturizing
t's pearl serum did not work for
this serum feels nice.
the eye cream is moisturizing
the lotion was ok.
this cream moisturize well.
now i'm using aloe vera gel
some people have used plain aloe vera gel
5 oz herbal recovery advanced serum
when i put this serum on my face
which is great when using under concealer
ingredients of my skin care products since i have amedical background
i would sometimes top it with kate's dilo oil or josie maran's argan oil to get some hydration
unlike the coordinating face moisturizer
while this may work as a makeup remover
even waterproof aqua eyeshadow
really wanted an antioxidant packed non-foaming cleanser
this cleanser is not as drying as fresh soy face
does not leave a firm on my skin like boscia purifying cleansing gel
but my mascara is waterproof.
i love the lather of the product
this cleansing oil-gel for me seems more like a gel than an oil
this cleanser is def moisturizing which is nice
i prefer a more moisturizing cleanser
mineral makeup--i have been a longtime fan of oil-based cleansers
i don't wear waterproof mascara
smells like a cheap cheap plastic cleanser
the cleanser does what it claims
my skin reacted with the cleanser
this product is ineffective at removing waterproof gel-eyeliner
in term of moisturizing it didn't do much
the facial cleanser i use for my acne is very stripping
it didn't help moisturize or hydrate my skin
cheaper moisturizers since purchasing this
it is a night time moisturizer
works well as a moisturizer
works exactly like a heavy moisturizer.
it just works like a normal moisturizer
smoothness like other moisturizing mask
it's a good moisturizing mask
advanced night eye serum
serum moisturizer eye cream=$38
the second ingredient is dimethicone-bummer
it is a nice light moisturizing cream for under eyes for sensitive skin
this may help chemically exfoliate the skin in order to reduce hyperpigmentation under the eyes
the beauty advisor highly recommended this cream over another cream
however i didn't feel it was that moisturizing
unlike other eye creams i've tried that show an almost instant difference in hydration
this eye cream is hydrating
when i apply concealer
i also expected the product to be a little more moisturizing than it was
concealer my under eye area looked cakey
it's not very moisturizing
ferulic + retinol overnight serum
i really wanted to love this product since i wanted to incorporate retinol in my skin care regimen
it's like a gel-lotion formula
us older ladies need hydration!!
retinol anti-aging moisturizer might do the trick
it is a good moisturizer
i soon realized that this moisturizer is simply not moisturizing enough for me
not what i look for in a moisturizer.
over all its hydrating, does the trick.
used up two jar of 30ml
it looked more like a serum than a cream when i squeezed it from the little sample pouch
after spending quite a lot on the serum
after about 2 month daily use i found that it is not moisturizing at all
the cream is definitely moisturizing my face
didn't moisturise my winter skin at all
i tried different kind of algenist moisturizer
this moisturizer is thicker
bought another bottle of the cleanser
tried many more times: after exfoliating
the preservative that they use to replace it with is phenoxyethanol which is supposedly worse than parabens
unnecessary extras in something made to "detox" my pores
i loved "first aid beauty face cleanser"
this cleanser works great for preventing my acne
this is a fine cleanser.
i usually use products with 2% benzoyl peroxide.
also the soap doesnt really lather
i used this product to cleanse my skin
religiously use the original cleanser in the winter time
i used this cleanser with my clarisonic
that's to be expected with gels
i like the concept of this cleanser
after using this cleanser
i like either a gentle oil cleaners or foaming cleaners
has an unstable source of vitamin c-
it feels like moisturizer
i used sk-ii's whitening serum before purchasing this product
this works fine as a nighttime moisturizer
with tons of vitamin c
i am a huge believer in vitamin c for staving off wrinkles
it is not too expensive for a brightening serum
any other you can refrigerate
use to help with puffiness
perhaps this eye cream isn't supposed to be hydrating/moisturizing
this one gives me an allergy
i've tried a variety of eye creams.
hydrate the eye area
i'd keep buying this moisturizer for the smell
this eye cream is thin and hydrating.
have tried lots of eye creams
i wanted it to reduce puffiness
it was moisturizing but not greasy.
this cream didn't do anything for me besides moisturizing
for 85 bucks a pop just moisturizing isn't good enough
i've used $15 drug store eye creams that were more effective
i just want preventative aging ingredients
moisturizing eye cream slide into my t-zone
it's a light weight lotion
my skin feels like i put sunblock on
wish they would put this into a pump like the sunscreen
they also recommend applying argan oil after using the argan milk
there is immediate moisturizing of the skin after using this
not a "treatment serum" as it claims as you would expect lasting moisture from a claim of being "intense therapy"
def was too moisturizing
i am combination skin
just after only one use of this argan milk it turns me to a night mare
i love facial oils
other facial oils instead of this product
feels like sunblock that won't absorb.
using my regular moisturizer
i enjoy using the josie maran argan oil as my night facial oil every once
also this smells like latex to me???
the texture is much runnier than i expected from an "intensive hydrating treatment"
definitely choose the argan oil over the milk.
it is very moisturizing which is a plus
regularly apply hydrating creams
im very big in moisturizing
it gave my oily skin a moisturizing cooling effect which made me believe it would be suitable for me
how truly moisturizing this mask is
it was not very moisturizing
still can't prevent dryness caused by this eye sunscreen
some kind of allergy i think
in my opinion clarins anti- age sunscreen works much better
i tried to put this sunscreen under my eyes
clean if used as a toner
i'd definitely get a sample before you purchase if you have sensitivity to oils/fragrances/extracts
a cleanser after using this to remove the rest of my makeup which consists of mascara
balms i was excited to try this product as it is scent-free
the acne solutions clarifying lotion picked up way more on the cotton ball
the cleanser is well priced
skin shouldn't purge with oil cleansing
there are cleansing oils
every time you squirt product it sprays every where
when i apply concealer under my eyes i have 1 fine line that all of the concealer settles into
keep concealer from creasing
it states on the description that this product is hydrating
it felt very moisturizing at first
one of the first ingredients is dimethicone
make the drying alcohols at the end of the list.
vitamin a towards the beginning
i love this moisturizer!
the lotion goes on smotthly
the lotion is lightweight
the moisturizer is really
the lotion is super lightweight
the lotion pilled when applying my makeup
i really like the black tea moisturizer
lightweight moisturizer that didn't irritate my skin
this lotion absorbs well.
it does hydrate your skin
thought this lotion would have a more cream-like texture
applying it feels less like i'm pampering my skin
more like i'm slapping on watered down sunscreen
the lotion smells stronger
this lotion smells good
it is pricy for a 1oz bottle
it was like putting a drugstore moisturizer on except that is is pricey
"pills" off the skin
this is an ok moisturizer
lightweight moisturizer for daytime use
i never have been able to use eye creams or serums
the oxidation of actives in the product unfortunately make this a no-go
i already take great care of my skin with tons of antioxidants
high spf daily moisturizer for my oily/very acne prone skin
my skin was not brightener
going back to my previous sunscreen
i am acne prone.
which is acne-prone
this moisturizer feels heavy
i switched from the origins spf 25 perfect world moisturizer
this is a lot of money for moisturizing skin cream that has an spf
at times it is not as moisturizing as i need
i've used other serums before
tinted moisturizer for eyes
the moisturizing isn't enough moisture
this goes well with mascara
i like first aid moisturizes
probably the retinyl palmitate?
works well when applied for extra coverage on your concealer
this is just not as moisturizing as i would like
try to origins ginseng eye cream
is so much more moisturizing than this
i find that i still have to use a concealer on top
concealer in one is ingenious
i much prefer the detox eye roller.
i like the applicator
thought the whitening might help
it does have lactic
salicylic acid for exfoliating
would help with my rosacea
this is a nice, hydrating serum booster.
either underneath or mixed with my regular serum
the only ingredient that seems like it might cause this for acne-prone skin is the linoleic acid perhaps?
i did not find it very moisturizing
i definitely need to apply a moisturizer over this
i prefer the milk cleanser.
to me the milk cleanser is just so soothing
making any mascara or eyeliner difficult to remove
i currently have the pumpkin enzyme
dry at the same time although this is supposed to be moisturizing
looks like 90s hair gel
i searched for a hydrating
cooling mask that hydrates the skin
every time i use this gel
it has the consistency of dippity do hair gel
because it's supposed to be moisturizing
kept lathering it on
i got allergy no as usually.
this cleanser is the most abrasive cleanser i've ever used
the texture of this is like a gel
i blamed it to a bad reaction to a bronzer.
i just assumed it was eye allergy to something seasonal
feel like glycolic acid in my cleanser is overkill for my skin
i do use glycolic acid products to help keep my skin smooth
i decided to try this because i wanted a cleanser that had glycolic acid
maybe the concentration of glycolic acid is greater that in my previous cleanser
always followed up with a serum
glycolic acid is tried
i finished my morning routine with the mario bodescu rose water facial spray
if it weren't for the fact that i like to have a glycolic acid cleanser in my arsenal
you can get other glycolic acid cleansers for a better price
a moisturizer is definitely needed.
the glycolic acid was just too harsh for me.
i wanted to like this cleanser
i love the ptr anti-aging face cleanser
wanted to try this cleanser out
this cleaning gel was not for me.
not to mention all the parabens!!!
i wouldn't recommend for a daily cleanser for dry skin
am using the bronzer
good sunscreen but too oily, broke me out
this is a foundation serum not a foundation
my 40 year old combination hyper pigmented skin needs more coverage
i top this with my lm mineral powder foundation
this serum is nothing like it.
i love that this serum can make my skin look good in the "no makeup" way
powder combination with this serum
i love the way the serum makes my skin look
however, the serum is too dark for my fair skin!
just in case my moisturizer made it change color
nothing about this gel is hydrating.
didn't realize this lotion contained caffeine
alcohol in a "hydrating" treatment!?
the product claims to be hydrating
why taut your star ingredient as a natural alternative to retinol
then include retinyl palmitate in your formulation anyways?
i love the rose smell of this gel-lotion
the lotion had too much of a fragrance
they recommend this oil along with the moisturizer
use the moisturizers/masks
can try the detox oil from caudalie
it is a good moisturizing creme
it is not moisturizing enough for my skin
even facial lotions can achieve this
swear by the soy cleanser
as much as i love the refreshing moisturizing feel to it
the eye gel is cooling
not as moisturizing as it advertises to be.
moisturizing it i couldn't get past the scent
i find a lot of eye creams/gels/gel creams i have used are kind of greasy
on a daily basis the only thing i put on my skin is moisturizer
i applied the eye cream
it's moisturizing but that's about it.
the serum in step 2 is good
a one time use serum is not worth $7.50:(
for now i'll stick to my beauty oils
unlike some of the vitamin c creams
the second step was hydrating
drugstore blackhead remover patches that are 100xs more effective
it was nice and moisturizing.
way too much serum
if you are sensitive to sunscreen
an eye highlighter or illuminator
i can't use the day cream with the sunscreen ingredients
noticing that several other reviewers are having problems with the sunscreen ingredients too
i didn't notice any exfoliating properties either
i highly recommend using a powder version of kaolin clay
applied glamglow powermud dualcleanse treatment after cleansing my face
then a moisturizing facial oil
it worked fine as an exfoliator.
one of the first ingredients on the list is "witch hazel water"
i also suggest following with a gel or cream cleanser afterwards
the sephora employee recommended this after i inquired about a serum for my oily
after a couple of days of using this serum
though any great facial moisturizer would do the same
must have a sensitivity to products with vitamin c
i will continue the search for my hg serum
use the truth serum
this is a very moisturizing under eye gel
read: i run on pure caffeine
this product felt like hairspray on my under eye.
it is hard to apply my under-eye concealer after.
no firming, no hydration, nothing.
not hydrating at all
if it touches other cream or serum in the near area
this is my first under eye cream/serum that i have ever purchased
it was not fabulous,like their vitamin c serum.
currently using the tarte under eye cream
it doesn't do any lifting or moisturizing.
isn't hydrating enough nighttime use
i am a big fan of their exfoliating cleanser
i will definitely continue to use their exfoliating cleanser
not this face wash or the toner
this cleanser is foamy
replenishing cleanser at the recommendation of a sephora staff member
like algenist would use sodium c14-16 olefin sulfonate in one of their products
i need a good cleanser to wash off my daily sunblock
purchased hoping that this moisturizer would help to brighten my skin
it's a great light moisturizer for oily skin
a silicone which can be drying to skin
with all the oil extracts, why add fragrance?
i used it as my moisturizer behind a mattifying clay mask doh
i applied the cream after washing my face
while this product was moisturizing
for a high priced mildy-moisturizing serum it smells really bizarre
-to be used in conjunction with moisturizer
this serum isn't doing anything for my skin
this "smart serum" did not nourish my skin.
it feels like more of a gel-cream lotion
it's supposed to be this magical repair serum
no more than any other decent moisturizing product
pros: i didn't break out; it was hydrating.
they call it a serum
it was first time that i was allergic to a skin care product
or josie maran argon oils
concentrating on the hyperpigmentation spots
as a treatment serum i do not find this product gives remarkable results
as a silicone-based primer with some bonus skin care ingredients it is great
i am not convinced it is worth the price tag as a skin serum
thought this serum would correct what ails
i've used cleansing oils from many other br
you also get to massage your face as you use an oil cleanser
this was my first venture into cleansing oils
or lots of other cleansing oils
i wear eye cream religiously for preventative reasons
i fell in love with korres quercetin
oak anti-aging/anti-wrinkle eye cream
have been purchasing natural paraben-free creams for a few years now to brighten my skin
it is not very moisturizing
was not moisturizing enough
doesn't "pill" under makeup
this cream moisturizes well
i decided to try this because i wanted more vitamin c in my skin care regimen
before activating it has a strong scent of tequila
maybe that explains the reviews saying it smells metallic or like vitamin c
ascorbic acid is acidified vitamin c
the real vitamin c in this mask is one of the last ingredients
like i do with my vitamin c serum
hormonal acne prone skin
no vitamin c activation happened
not at all rejuvenating!
lather my face in jojoba oil
i would describe it as "chemical citrus" ha
this might be an effective exfoliator
ole henriksen truth serum for vitamin c
it does moisturize my skin
giving it three 3 because it does moisturize
i wanted to love this moisturizer.
i've used two bottles of the 50 ml size
i don't see how it can or would boost the effects of my serum
the serum also smells good.
this is marketed as a booster to your moisturizer
it is important to mention that this serum/primer does contain a lot of alcohol
i've used their moisturizers for years.
which is in the ingredients
the sales lady said it will help with hyperpigmentation
if you buy quality serums
the only good thing i can say about this serum is that it is a true serum
only complaint i have is the smell as i prefer my serums to be odourless
alone serum for me
then layer it with one or two serums for day
this is a good serum for any skin type
with the onslaught of serums
i buy a jar of the bio-performance revitalizing cream
my allergist said reactions on the eyelids were almost always due to something applied topically
i wanted a serum that was antiaging
the serum is very light weight
i used it as a pre serum like it said with cliniques smart serum
it was just like a regular moisturizer
this lotion has a ton of ingredients.
as a sufferer from mild rosacea
it did feel very moisturizing
this is one of those cream sleeping type masks
i got sample of ultimate anti-aging melting cleanser
i shouldn't feel like i need a cleanser after a cleanser
it works well when i rinse using a soft washcloth
i got this cleanser as part of the anti-aging kit
i really like oil cleansers
when i found this cleanser
leaves a greasy film all over your face which means that this oil-gel cleanser is for a double-cleanse only
this was after a thorough rinsing
the types of cleansers i use
help to moisturize my skin
i think it's the oils used in this cleanser.
i only use non-waterproof mascara
the cleanser did breakdown into a milk
mascara residue on my face cloth after using this cleanser
it will moisturize your skin
after i used it i ran toner over my face
i also tried algenist rejuvenating cleanser 1 week later
i found that cleanser to be gentler on my skin
like plastic or solvent
it does not remove my sunscreen
cleansing oil i've tried before
i don't use waterproof
i noticed my concealer was cakey
the product is not very emollient at all.
i've used eye creams that feel way more hydrating
it was very moisturizing though
i tried this cream
for the price of the eye cream
i love the oils
along with the creams
just starting to try eye creams
i still use it on my facial makeup
it is definitely a serum
i can't comment on how well the serum works because the scent is overpowering
herbal scents aren't horrible for me
i don't see any difference between this serum
the mushroom skin relief lotion from the texture
when paired with another moisturizer
this serum does not seem to reduce redness.
the serum is not.
rew weil treatment lotion
by itself this serum is very sticky
the texture of this serum is not for me
it's not waterproof mascara
annoying for a face cleanser
when i wipe my face with my toner
also something that l could use to remove mascara
l used my usual makeup remover
should not be marketed as a cleanser
it was a very nice moisturizing make up remover
true toner before moisturizing
after a night of heavy waterproof cosplay makeup
followed it with a soy based cleanser
after using the cleansing gelee
i would have purchased an eye-makeup remover as this product was rather ineffective on mascara
i don't even wear waterproof mascara
this cleanser went on smooth
i usually love oil cleansers
i've tried probably a dozen cleansing balms/oils
its "citrus" fragrance was actually quite chemically
my twice-a-week exfoliating product to get rid of
the number one ingredient is mineral oil.
if i wanted mineral oil i would buy baby oil
i never use mineral oil on my skin
which is fine because mineral oil is a great hypoallergenic oil to cleanse with
my search for a hydrating
you are risking getting dark spots because it is a retinol cream
must use eye concealer
perfect as a prep step for concealer
retinol eye cream does not hydrate
this eye cream is not hydrating at all.
weil skin brightening serum
i prefer the ginzing eyecream as a daytime eye cream
the scent on this moisturizer isn't as bad the cold plasma sub-d
this could a great moisturizer for a girl with normal skin
have been on the hunt for a hg face cream/serum/treatment
nothing so far beats clarins double serum for all-day hydration
i get very similar results from a hyaluronic acid serum at less than half the cost
especially the leave on products like lotions
don't need a heavy moisturizer
worse than using a moisturizer.
this serum is not an exclusion.
i will stick with my caudalie serum.
i don't have to use as much concealer.
if you get a headache from perfumes
this serum is too drying to use on its own
does nothing it moisturizes
while this claims to be a gentle cleanser
so unless a cleanser is designed for oily or acne prone skin
when i don't need to exfoliant i use this.
i didn't notice exfoliating effect either.
this foaming cleanser seems fine
i applied it with the vitamin c serum every morning after toner
use every morning before moisturizer
lots of herbal oils and good foundation.
it isn't as moisturizing as others i've used
i love their serum (although it is expensive).
treating the dryness than this mask
i used face lotion after
i applied it with the licorice serum every morning after toner
i believe the serum is in a clear bottle because the vitamin c etc is only in the tiny gel capsules
alone concentrated serum to power punch dark circles
perhaps it would if the serum
i will continue to search for the promising serum
i like this serum.
i spent $45 for a watered down version of hyaluronic acid
vitamin c, e and matryxl are common mixtures.
creams to keep the moisture in
it did not moisturize at all
as a serum, this product is simply okay.
i don't feel like it is potent enough as a serum
i do like this serum a lot
the hyaluronic acid is listed as an ingredient after the preservative
as if i've just applied toner
since it's collagen serum
plus this contains potassium hydroxide
the serum gave me a few pimples on area that i don't normally breakout
other serum from this line
i still had to use a moisturizer afterwards
this product did absolutely nothing in terms of contouring/slimming my jawline
this product "lifts" facial features such as cheeks
received a sample of shaping facial lift lipo drain serum
the serum is very sticky
no matter what type of cream i use after this serum
it is a clear serum
it isn't really a true serum
ard hyaluronic acid-based serum
t dna transforming pearl serum
it does an okay job of moisturizing
have all day hydration
after my serum at night
it does not do proper moisturizing to me
my face has combo skin
white bumps right where i was applying this serum
i really wanted to love it because it was moisturizing
not so great toner.
hydrogenated caster oil is high up on the ingredient list
want to try a couple other micellar/cleanser waters before i buy again
makeup remover at the end of the day
their soy face cleanser i love it
it feels like your typical toner with a wet
sephora specialist suggested to alternate against the vitamin nectar mask
for the high price i expected more than just moisturizing
no hydrating effects even
my skin is combination
i am certainly expecting something more moisturizing as overnight mask
i like that as it feels like real moisturizing is going on there
with fresh soy cleanser
i like firming masks
this one isn't nearly as good as the black tea serum
it is very thick and moisturizing.
e the migraine to any other trigger
it doesn't feel moisturizing
thick, but not moisturizing.
a petroleum-derived organic alcohol
while this is a nice serum for softening the skin
it is too expensive to just use as a basic serum
creams over the years
use moisturizer with sunscreen daily from an early age to minimize how many wrinkles you get when you are older
i apply after truth serum has sunk in
lightly moisturizer face in the morning
this isn't going to be like botox
so it works great when used with botox!
have used sunscreen daily for 31 years
i find "power advanced wrinkle serum" by algenist to work a lot better
this cream does not replace or work as well as botox
this has to be mentioned i get botox for my crows feet every 4 months
still no botox replacement.
i will look for something alternative in a topical cream
as a wrinkle relaxer it failed
then applying this lotion-type product
save your money for retinol or laser
overall dull prior to moisturizing
i remove my makeup before using this cleanser
save your money on this cleanser
to go with a milder cleanser
just like a bunch of other facial cleansers
the hydrating face wash
removes my makeup except the mascara
i will not recommend for acne-prone skin
you will need to use another cleanser
using this cleanser on clean skin may work for that
i used it as a makeup remover
after mixing with water to rinse
seed oils my skin allergies were triggered by one of them
i love the moisturizer
i coupled with the moisturizer
fragrance is just unnecessary in skin care products
i typically follow up with serum
it's weird because it felt moisturizing after use
it does appear to moisturize your skin
find myself reapplying this moisturizer
this cream was moisturizing
it didn't work well on moisturizing
this moisturizer was not moisturizing
i need something hydrating
on top of that it didn't feel particularly moisturizing
it also didn't agree with the sunscreen i use
this moisturizer does clog pores
after putting on some sunscreen a few minutes after this moisturizer
i love the smell of this moisturizer
this moisturizer is ok
was excited to cash in some of my points for this moisturizing
a most certain addiction to exfoliation
i knew i needed to hydrate vs moisturize my skin with the products i use
moisturizing wasn't the way to go
nstead of moisturizing my face
it's not very moisturizing
2 stars though because it is very moisturizing
for a 19 year-old using a sample to moisturize her eye area at night
eye creams out there
now if philosophy would only eliminate the parabens from the cleanser
it did feel moisturizing
i'll stick to my tubes of creams in the future.
there are better cleansing oils.
are the tatcha cleansers failing to clean my skin?
tonight i will test with my clinique exfoliating scrub followed by the tatcha toner
very moisturizing and soothing on skin.
i've used several cleansing oils
it was a hydrating oil
i used this with the baby facial
it had a sample of their luxury facial oil
i would use this oil at night after the glycolic night serum
blackheads everywhere after cutting off dairy to fix my hormonal acne issue
i substituted raw aloe vera after my night serum
made to include gentle exfoliation in the morning with grinder oatmeal
f you discover that this oil is too emollient for your skin
: aloe vera has a lot of amazing qualities
while hydrating my skin
i really expected this to be my hg facial oil
that the products are not moisturizing my skin enough
i didn't like the viscosity of this oil
maybe some acne prevention or anti aging benefits
didn't find this to by hydrating at all
it also does a nice job at moisturizing cuticles.
except it did help with acne breakouts
like the serum because it makes my skin bright
the c-firma day serum
the b-hydra gel
i heard so much hype about this serum
it contains the detergent like chemical sulfate
they try to make up for it by adding other moisturizing ingredients like marula oil
i find the facial cleansing bars to be very drying
come out with a liquid cleanser
this is not soap
i really liked this facial soap at first.
i find the facial cleansing bars to be very drying
juju either in the morning or night for a weekly exfoliation
i think the exfoliating beads may be a little much
i do not exfoliate my skin everyday
i like it is made of natural ingredients
the exfoliation was too harsh for my skin
it helps with acne
wish that they would make a more moisturizing bar
it felt very moisturizing
i also like that it has antioxidants.
i needed to add a glycolic wash back into my weekly skin care regime to help slough off the dead skin with a stronger exfoliation
i applied it right after my toner.
it made my moisturizer less effective
the sephora associate recommend this elixir when i asked for a serum
so far i do like the toner and exfoliator.
(i've used the elixir once a day only.)
i much preferred the polyphenol night oil which really cleared up my acne
soothed my dermatitis/rosacea
while the oil is quite moisturizing
not a fan of this cleanser
i like the ingredients
it's an average cleanser
the yogurt ingredient that is being advertised in this product is the very last ingredient listed meaning it has smallest concentration of all ingredients
def not moisturizing at all.
this cleanser does not have any exfoliating benefits
leaves a feeling of applied moisturizer
it doesn't cleanse the skin
not foaming or purifying
i don't wear waterproof liner or mascara
after rinsing off the cleanser
i guess it's supposed to be the moisturizing bit?
does give a nice moisturizing result after
please bring the milk protein cleanser back!!!!!
not even waterproof mascara
fragrance ingredients like geraniol
the cream is not deeply moisturizing
it does provide a smooth surface for concealer
my concealer worked way better with this product on
i still have to use a lot of concealer
i would recommend sephora or clinique rollerball eye cooling gel instead
this product was put on me during a concealer consult
i still have to use another eye cream for moisturizing
the product is moisturizing
its always a hassle because concealer
i tried several eye creams
i noticed more creasing of my concealer with this
which is a waste of gel-an expensive gel
upsold this product to me
the product is hydrating
throughout the day my concealer would flake off
like most eye creams
try their moisturizing undereye concealer
i got this moisturizer as a gift
this eye concentrate works well as a moisturizer.
not via scrubbing or exfoliating ingredients.
my combination skin was unthrilled
the way the product foams
i received a free sample of this foaming sonic facial soap
although it is unscented
when i rinse this soap off
this cleanser was drying
ren as facial products
i don't like the silicones in it.
this serum is okay
this serum wasn't for me
any time i would layer this under any other cream or moisturizer
doesn't hold moisture for an extended time if i only use the serum
i tried this serum after using the original skin rose clay mask since i liked it so much
at first i liked the serum a lot
over all this serum just made me break out
it was also causing my moisturizer
i will have to keep shopping around for a serum better suited for my skin
i really wanted to love this serum
don't really think this is a serum
if you don't need a heavy duty serum
was expecting for this serum to provide some extra moisture
does not feel moisturizing enough for my skin
this serum is thick for a serum
i expect more from a serum
i also do not find this to be very moisturizing
this serum is just ok though.
it is more like a primer than a serum.
i wish it were a skin softening plumping formula.
for acne prone skin
i will not repurchase because my favorites are pumpkin enzyme
i do however love ptr's pumpkin enzyme mask
the pumpkin enzyme mask is 10 times better
this is super-hydrating
i prefer just a moisturizing cream, not firming.
this is basically just a moisturizing masque
it is advertised to be hydrating
it is advertised to be odorless
using a moisturizing lotion after as this mask can make you a little dry
sensitive skin with mild hormonal acne
it's beautiful as a moisturizing illuminator
i used it to wash my beauty blender now .
using argan oil afterwards day
i may add that i use a moisturizer after cleansing my face in the morning
some of my other anti-aging face washes feel more like lotions
with the liberal use of my regular moisturizer
immediately after i wash my face with this i have to moisturize
however, i have acne and blackheads.
this is a good cleanser for those without acne
yes i was moisturizing
like putting detergent on your skin.
this feels very similar to an orange drugstore cleanser
would not buy--with all the parabens
decided to try the cleansing gel
i do not have puffiness or wrinkles
added a shiseido eye cream to my routine to aid with hydration
causes me problems when i try to apply my concealer for the day
so when i read about vitamin k
this product is a gel
t's not as moisturizing as a cream would be
cannot apply undereye concealer when using this produce because it flakes off
cannot be used with concealer
save your money for a good concealer.
ptr's power k eye rescue is a good moisturizer
it feels very moisturizing
i love the gel formula
because it's an exfoliating cleanser
s together to create a foaming lather" well this product never foams
it was great for daily exfoliating
glamglow youthcleanse daily exfoliating cleanser is too harsh even for normal skin
i decided to go with this one since it is marketed as exfoliating
exfoliating than this one
acne in the past
you can damage your skin if you over exfoliate.
try to invest in a good moisturizer
the exfoliating power of the cleanser
just another exfoliating face wash
i'll be continuing to use my drugstore cleanser for sensitive skin
i will stick to my normal cleanser
even after applying moisturizer
or acne at all
that was after i exfoliated with the org mineral peel exfoliator three times
wanted to try the matching cleanser
this cleanser is drying
it took 4 days of major moisturizing
once i use a moisturizer
this cleanser was definitely moisturizing
it doesn't blend well with concealer or foundation
i've tried other eye creams
i found it to be very moisturizing
the cream was not hydrating at all
this eye cream is hydrating
also that many creams burn my face
which helps with puffiness
it is lightweight gel like
then i use a thin regular moisturizer all over my face the next day with sunscreen as undereye moisturizer melts my off
soy cleanser which i love
i wanted a moisturizing cream that is preventive for wrinkles
it is an amazing moisturizer
started using as a serum underneath my daytime bb cream
when i read "omega-rich superfoods that promotes smooth
as excited as i was for this nutrient packed product
this serum was okay.
skip if you have rosacea.
the fragrance may cause breakouts
s since the residue left on your skin is moisturizing
because the oil does not cleanse mascara or eyeshadow off well enough
after i clean my face i use toner or astringent
gets congested without exfoliation
following with an exfoliant might help
an unscented version would be preferable.
i got this cleanser in the plasma essentials kit.
i think i'll stick with the perricone nutrive cleanser
is more of a toner than a st
highlighters are my color.
moisturizing on my skin
recommended it as a great daily moisturizer
it looked like i was rubbing bronzer on my face
spf in one product
the serum didn't appear to do anything
0% humidity -- was so excited to find an spf + bronzer in one
put this moisturizer on with no makeup to test it
i really need to start using sunblock
the product has some kind of color capsules in it
titanium dioxide or zinc oxide
i love the no foundation serum
i will be going back to the serum.
be aware that it is a bronzer or self tanner
the dry spots on my cheeks loved this moisturizing cream
some of the effects of this cream are great: it's hydrating
it did moisturize my skin.
i love any serum with anti-aging benefits
i rigorously apply a simple vitamin c serum everyday
it didn't have the pleasant vitamin c smell i am used to
i used this serum followed by my usual josie maran argan oil
had high hopes for this serum
more delicious than an anti-aging serum has any right to smell
i think the product works well under moisturizer
it was somewhat moisturizing.
i don't have acne prone skin
not the antiaging moisturizer
i believe the ingredient chlorella protothecoides is causing the issue as it's not found in the moisturizer
even after i use moisturizer
the serum has a nice consistency
so that every time i followed it with moisturizer or bb cream
the serum would ball up
i've never had another serum do that
t had to be the serum rubbing off
i would give this another chance if they omitted the coumarin
you can find much better vitamin c serum's for a lower price
this serum has the worst smell.
i follow this with astara brightening moisturizer
just like genifique it is a great serum
since it content vitamin c
putting on this serum with that "caramel
i need to use it as this serum is not cheap.
had to get hydrocortisone shots
found it no more effective than the vitamin c lotion from another popular br
that comes in capsules
love algenist however the trial i received of this serum proved to be super disappointing- my face developed some redness
it causes a lot of acne.
even after applying moisturizer on top of it
the serum itself is beautiful
i like how my skin feels after i use the cleanser
you can use it as a mask or cleanser
i get a few hormonal acne on my chin
jawline so a rep at the store suggested this gel for it
just like another layer of moisturizer
as the consistency is most like a thicker gel-based lotion
pills up under makeup
dennies gross for my acne problems
this is a very thin serum
it didn't have hydrating benefits.
this seems more like a tinted sunscreen.
not even moisturizing though
being a moisturizer, its not moisturizing at all.
it does a good bit of exfoliating
it causes micro tears in the skin the best exfoliators i have found areaha or bha liquid exfoliators
i got a sample of this exfoliating powder
i exfoliate regularly with clinique 7 day scrub
mild-hormonal-acne-prone
i liked how the exfoliant was a fine texture
plus i found a better less expensive serum.
just sprays perfume on all the time
have to be very careful with serums/lotions because they have this ingredient
using an exfoliating scrub to try to normalize my skin
the only good thing about this serum is the smell
i did like this serum
i figured since the vitamin c line worked wonders
i really wanted to love this serum
layering sunscreen etc on top means your skin feels like it has a film on it
had to exchange it at sephora store for another serum
i would expect a vitamin c-based serum to absorb in less than 5 minutes
this serum really evened out my skin
i don't remember the serum having any smell.
i love dermadoctor's poetry in lotion
quick results with vitamin c
considering it's a morning serum
i will likely return and try a cheaper c serum.
it smells musky, like a guys deodorant.
i would suggest you try the vitamin enriched face base
feels like just a basic moisturizer
even two shades of bb creams
use acne medicine daily
it has as herbal smell.
it pills, flakes and does not moisturize.
just did an all around perfect job moisturizing my skin for the day
night cream products for years
the only moisturizer i found to work
this new formula is simply not as moisturizing as the old one
this new formula does not moisturize my skin as well as the old formulation did
it was my moisturizer for many years
i'll have to find a different moisturizer.
it also pills under my makeup.
pill under my tinted moisturizer
this new formula is not as hydrating
this version makes my foundation "pill".
for the price i paid i hope it did more for my skin other than just moisturizing
this is a solid daily moisturizer.
i am in search of a moisturizer with spf
then i looked at the sunscreen ingredients
hope philosophy changes up their sunscreen ingredients
wasn't very moisturizing either.
it's a balm not a cream or a gel
while it is very moisturizing i haven't seen a difference in my fine lines
i might give this another star if it were a little more moisturizing
their makeup cleansing lotion-i'm not impressed with their products
it is not as moisturizing as i thought it would be
wanted to try an oil that contained retinol to help with my skin turnover
didn't feel like it was super moisturizing
i typically love herbal scents
need to change up my skin regimen
help with acne breakouts on occasion
as for acne spots
it ends with synthetic dyes
in conjunction with the good genes moisturizer as recommended
retinol esters don't work the same way because you have to convert them into retinol for them to work
but call it what it is...a night oil serum.
btw, oils are not "hydrating" they are emollient.
wrinkles that i was hoping this cream would help
as far as moisturizing
just use this as my moisturizer
i saw some pretty good results each time i used them either mixing them together or just using one serum separately or one serum mixed in my eye cream or face cream
i tried mixing it with different moisturizers
replenish which is the hyaluronic acid serum
reborn which is the collagen serum
at first i was using a drop of vitamin a on each cheek
didn't need the extra hydration from hyaluronic acid
have to assume the vitamin a was responsible
i would have expected the vitamin a to be a bit irritating
the serum is too thick and goooy.
for one serum that does the work of 3
c- for the efficacy of the product
i like the serum.
i got vitamin a/chlorella/french pine bark
i wanted to start using retinal
i always thought a retinol should irritate your skin
starting to break out after using this serum
have been dealing with hormonal acne
i know i"m supposed to wear sunscreen
not a fan of the silicone primers
it works super great as my sunscreen for my h
if you need to wear makeup over your sunscreen
what was my moisturizer of choice
i need to apply over moisturizer
when i apply any concealer or foundation on top
i've recently developed allergies to common sunscreen ingredients which have left my face marked
as this is spf 30
if i use the recommended amount of about a 1/4 teaspoon
i won't be returning the sunscreen
when you put lotion or sunscreen on top
this sunscreen is great in theory
it almost feels like pure silicone or glycerin
its an ok moisturizer but its not mattifying.
i think this moisturizer really does moisturize my skin
it is a gel base
like my browwiz or pomade
it is not very good at moisturizing either.
could use regular face lotion
this isn't super moisturizing
rescue me from this moisturizer!
the only reason that i gave this more than one star is because it's moisturizing
this moisturizer gave me huge under the skin pimples
ok moisturizer, but nothing special.
i really like that it is formulated without parabens
am naturally drawn to matte moisturizers
it is very moisturizing, though.
$8 drugstore primer than this
sure it have some botanicals
this was not moisturizing enough
wanted to try a new moisturizer
i prefer tea tree or peppermint for essential oils
it is a moisturizing enough
if you are using liquid sunscreen under makeups everyday
this lotion is not good for acne prone skin.
the sunscreen left my face with white spots
if i don't use a mask or forget to exfoliate
i picked up a sample of this "hydrating" cleanser in hopes of restoring moisture into my skin
i wanted a toner water
eye makeup is makeup
this is a good light weight moisturizer for morning time use
it also smells very herbal which i'm fine with.
it does contain silicone
i like how lightweight this moisturizer is
was hoping this would be a lot more moisturizing
it is lightweight yet very moisturizing.
however, it pills when i use it over serum.
this moisturizer makes me super oily
as it's a gel moisturizer
$22 for less than an ounce (0.84 oz.
it is very moisturizing without being sticky
it is my first time using a moisturizing cream because i have a oily
i would use this as a night moisturizer
i do experience hormonal break outs
i am always on the look out for new hydrating moisturizers
it smells like men's deodorant
without any moisturizing benefits
this is not a night cream nor a day moisturizer.
because aqua bomb contains dimethicone
i prefer the moisturizing bomb by belif to this.
after my serums/before makeup
my skin is combination
definitely some level of moisturizing
need more than just a little extra moisturizing
yes, it's moisturizing, but no miracle product.
i tried the aqua bomb moisturizer
it could be because of the toner
i love the moisturizing bomb and the aqua bomb.
it is very moisturizing
jurlique's cleansing oil didn't remove my mascara
it def does moisturize compared to most cleansers
then use my summer gel cleanser
i'd consider this a cleanser if you want to pre-cleanse first?
i've used a bunch of eye creams
it moisturizes like any other cream out there
the cream didn't hydrate my skin
then i used undereye concealer with it the next day
it wasn't the concealer bc i've used it with other eye creams before
my skin doesn't have any allergy to it
it's strictly a moisturizing, anti-aging cream**
moisturizes the eye area
this product was not hydrating at all
it's just moisturizing and that's it.
i wish this was just a basic everyday moisturizer that helped turnaround skin cells
i wanted to ignore the glitter part because the moisturizing part of it is amazing
what kind of daytime moisturizer has no spf???
i really like this lotion
i love clinique moisturizers
this moisturizer is light weight
it isn't moisturizing enough for my liking
i didn't find it moisturizing
i tried it by itself and under moisturizer.
i would like it better if it was odorless
does it have antioxidants?
this oil is hydrating
(several additives are suspected carcinogens.
moisturizing at the same time
as i love a clay cleanser
this cleanser didn't help with my breakouts
switch to the hydrating one
i'll stick to my cleansing oils
will get a migraine in like 2seconds
this is a great as a sunscreen
although i'd prefer it to be unscented
it's not very moisturizing at all for those with drier or combination skin
i received this in the sephora sun kit
i switched from the algenist anti-aging day cream with spf to try this
whipped texture of this moisturizer
it caused my foundation to pill
have used the genius moisturizer
their genius vit c serum
it's also not very moisturizing.
this product really acts more like a sunscreen then a moisturizer that happens to have spf
is almost mattifying when applied
i like that this moisturizer has spf 30.
my dermatologists say to use spf 30 every day.
however people should know that sunscreen in a jar is going to be exposed to light
the best sunscreens are in a tube or bottle.
i love this moisturizer
more like applying sunscreen
it didn't seem very moisturizing
it's not very moisturizing.
it feels a bit like you're just wearing sunscreen
presumably due to the sunscreen
i would use strictly as sunscreen if your skin does not need an abundance amount of hydration
the sunscreen in this is great
in a weird way i feel like this sunscreen moisturizer has been improving my skin
it does have the "sunscreen smell"
used this sunscreen over it
this stuff didn't feel moisturizing
it felt like old school thick 80s sunscreen.
i love all of the first aide beauty moisturizers
i used this as my sunscreen during a week at the beach
i don't see how this would work as a daily sunscreen
i really wanted to like this sunscreen
it's more a heavy duty sunscreen than a moisturiser for sure
tried to use a combination of different moisturizers
i figured that this sunscreen would work wonders as it did for my body
when i saw that this product had "hydrating
i loved how it contained no synthetic fragrances
this acts like a sunscreen, not a moisturizer.
i wanted a moisturizer with a sunscreen in it
not a sunscreen with a moisturizer in it
this feels like sunscreen
it seems just like typical sunscreen
a mineral sunscreen moisturizer with an spf that wasn't too high or too low
i wanted to give this sunscreen a shot because i love fab
i can only wear mineral sunscreens so when i saw fab had released a moisturizer/mineral sunscreen combo i was sold
this works fine as a sunscreen
this sunscreen makes it look chalky
i am pretty obsessed with sunscreen
a fine sunscreen that is easy to blend.
but it is not a moisturizer.
just feels like a regular sunscreen
i appreciate that it's a zinc sunscreen because a lot of people
break out with chemical sunscreens
need more physical sunscreen options
this is a straight up white zinc heavy sunscreen that can only be used on the beach
all of the types of acne
after hearing that this helps with acne
y as a a quick cleanser
i usually use the purifying
not with this cleanser.
this cleanser is okay.
i liked it paired with the matching lotion
the anti-aging aspects seems to overpower any moisturizing qualities
i'd recommend using this product as a supplement to a moisturizing lotion
while the serum was easy to use
use my regular serum
i won't be purchasing this serum
followed the tip in another review stating to spritz some caudalie grape water on face before rinsing off the mask
after rinsing i spritzed my face again with the grape water
i think i will stick to my sulfur mask instead for spot treatments
this worked well for moisturizing my skin in the winter
no moisturizing effect at all3
it doesn't that moisturizing
thought i would give this a try to detox my skin
dose not take well to certain oils like coconut oil for example
it says it's moisturizing
also reminds me a lot aloe gel
the one you use after sunburn
three other cleansing balms last week
i still notice some makeup residue afterwards when i apply toner
i love balm cleansers.
i like oil cleansers second only to balm ones
i love the erborian double lotion
which i feel takes away from the moisturizing effectsoverall: i will continue to use this from time to time
if they made a moisturizer or foamy cleanser with this scent i would buy it in a heartbeat
like i have lotion on my face
i don't love this cleansing balm
foundation that came off on my toner pad
it was very moisturizing
switched my moisturizer to this
isn't moisturizing in the least if you try to avoid the thick feeling
it's moisturizing but that's about it.
i used other eye creams by dermadoctor
i don't, i prefer more moisture and plumping.
this cleanser is -fine-
so the cleanser will r
i definitely prefer the charcoal wash in the pump bottle for convenience
i switched to the pump cleanser.
a sephora employee told this is an exfoliator.
as a cleanser it works
pregnancy hormones have made my skin thirsty
my skin is combo
this is a twist- up cleanser with the consistency softer than that of a glycerin soap
no major hydration ingredients
the texture was that of hand sanitizer.
other essences i have tried
i think it's a basic light, gel cream.
i found if used without the essence it wasn't moisturizing enough for my skin
didn't soothe or moisturize my skin
taking out all other serums
would keep it as an oil for massage
i tried this serum on my h
this serum irritate my skin my skin a little
layered with spf moisturizer
the girl used this for the serum
it reeks of ammonia/chlorine
if you are putting fragrance/perfume in your produce
the granules help you exfoliate your skin when you remove it
i love the exfoliating power!
the redness goes does overnight with aloe if you're not too sensitive
70's who knew about sunscreen?
caused really severe allergy to my skin
for now i don't need a nearly $70 facial exfoliating mask
i rather just use whitening mask than spending $80 on this
framboos along with a charcoal daily cleanser
whatever results i get are lost despite sunscreen
bought the drugstore apricot scrub
works ok as an exfoliator
i am giving this only 3 stars since i am still yet to see the glycolic acid effects
whenever i get glycolic acid treatments from my derma
i love that this product is a moisturizer
as far as sunscreen + moisturizers go
only used 2 pumps of lotion in the morning
this product is great for exfoliating the skin
i tried to fix it with a moisturizing mist
the consistency is of a gel-moisturizer
this product is very moisturizing for the undereye
if i use it underneath concealer
it makes the concealer flake
i've tried combining it with more emollient eye products without success
i'd recommend clinique eye repair cream with spf 20
acne prone adult skin
this moisturizer is okay
it felt just like sunscreen to me.
leaves that sunscreen feel and smell.
my search for a good moisturizer with spf continues
i really wanted to love this product since i have been searching for a sunscreen
don't like the strong sunscreen smell that it has
never with a moisturizer that contained sunscreen
switched back to the sephora 8 hr mattifying moisturizer sunscreen
for people who have acne
algae ones the most
i will stick to my nighttime face oils.
someone pointed out that pomegranate is very hydrating
it was so delightful – usually don't use moisturizing masks because my skin skews oily
i only put moisturizer on my cheeks
decided to give this matifying lotion a try
toner or a cleansing wipe
i would not recommend this cleanser
i love cleansing oils for makeup removal
i love cleansing oils
i find it nice as a facial massage
i normally wear a full face of makeup most days including matte lipsticks
purchased this because i liked the face serum version of this
this texture of this "eye concentrate" reminds me of a light weight lotion
it is very expensive for just a moisturizing under eye gel
it was definitely moisturizing
i first started to use their serum in the line because i love that light non-greasy texture
sanitizer for your face
$60 for 1 ounce of facial masque with such low percentages of active ingredients is highway robbery
like some treatments do
this "serum" is significantly this kee than any other serum i own or have tried
my skin normally responds to moisturizers
i used the serum with no problems whatsoever
unless you use any sort of exfoliating product beforeh
my sephora didn't have any other travel size moisturizers from clinique
acne solutions clarifying lotion
this moisturizing cream in hopes that my horrible break outs would clear up
moisturizer residues stay on your face
bought this lotion for my dry skin
i am a diehard fan of clinique's dramatically different moisturizing lotion
this serum is excellent.
i tried the e serum i didnt like it as much.
will try the chamomile one soon:)
the first ingredient is a silicone
i need a very hydrating moisturizer
do not curl up like other gel moisturizers
it's a good daily moisturizer
for someone with my oily skin it is way too moisturizing
bought a more moisturizing moisturizer that has some anti-aging benefits
love the ptr cucumber foaming cleanser
i love the texture of this gel
although this was hydrating i couldn't use it
i wanted to love this moisturizer
was excited when i found their anti-aging moisturizer with spf
opinions of anti-aging moisturizers
in fact i don't think it's as moisturizing
i'd hoped this would be a great sunscreen
the sunscreen ingredients are unstable
especially because i am a huge fan of the philosophy eye retinoid- that stuff works like the prescripts my derm gives me
overpriced sunscreen that does nothing as it says
i got the product based sephora beauty advisor recommended if i want my skin treat combination of hydration
perhaps it is the glycolic acid or maybe the sake
i tried this in conjunction with a facial oil
maybe this has good moisturizing properties
the gel has a strong alcohol smell that reminds me of nailpolish remover
the consistency is like a serum
not a sticky serum like product
i think that if you've used glycolic acid
did not moisturize my face.
i wanted to love this gel cream.
compared to other light moisturizers i have used
it should be on the list of moisturizers for people who have acne or blemish prone skin
this moisturizer is also good for brightening
the cleansing gel was ok, nothing special.
i love oils for the face
it is not very moisturizing
works as an ok moisturizer,
i enjoy this moisturizer for my everyday needs
the sheer transformation moisturizer is a better option than this moisturizer
i felt that they just made a gel compound out of cucumber
which is actually a gel
as for helping with puffiness
not as hydrating as others
this eye cream is marketed for " daytime " use
such as foundation or concealer
decent hydrating eye creme/gel.
didn't feel as moisturizing
my skin is combination
i could see the concealer
it wasn't particularly moisturizing.
you need something for puffiness
i started using this eye cream along with l'occitane's eye serum
i when back to using the serum at night
decided to try the eye balm
i don't have wrinkles
i don't know if the eye balm is moisturizing.
i don't have wrinkles
i wanted to love this moisturizer since i use the immortelle night cream
i decided to try their cheaper moisturizer- precious cream
i can tell it's moisturizing
i sure did have a histamine reaction with every product in this line
i've used retinol products with little to no irritation
too bad they don't offer an unscented/fragrance-free version
ter shea moisturizing fluid is much better for me
looked up the ingredients--turned out it contains sodium lauryl sulfate
stearic acid as the 7th
basically this product is a cocktail of comedogenic chemicals
it is not moisturizing
water gel moisturizer are good
even tho the moisturizer contains alcohol
i got a deluxe sample of the tatcha deep hydration firming serum
at $114 cdn for 30 ml/1 oz, this was a splurge!
i wanted a serum with hyaluronic acid
this serum is just ok.
however their radiant deep hydrating serum is the best serum i've ever used
however the serum inside is just so so.
i tried the other tatcha brightening serum
i prefer the brightening serum
my serum happened to run out
i adore this serum.
before you invest in this serum
it's meant to look "clinical" with the dropper
it does not work to draw up serum
lines like this serum
my medicine dropper quickly broke with serum in the tube
i am happy the serum is in a pump
this serum may be effective
the problem is the eye dropper dispenser does not pull in or release the serum
i waste what is a very expensive serum
slightly moisturizing if you can get it out of the bottle
this serum did not work for me, however.
i applied various algenist moisturizers after the serum
or the combo of serum + moisturizer globbed on the surface of my face
unlike other serums from algenist
it felt like applying a perfume on my face.
have to mix this product with face crème in order to actually moisturize my face
when i filtered moisturizers to meet my skin
try to work the cleanser into the skin
just a typical face lotion or primer.
even after serum i find myself putting two layers of this moisturizer on to feel like i have an adequate amount for the day
there is no sunscreen in this blend
the cream/serum did not deliver what it promised
2 stars because it's unscented
this masque gave my skin irritation.
i ended up returning this serum as there was no change in the redness of my skin
i don't use it daily as i have other serums
this serum did nothing for my skin's redness
the redness decreases some soon applying this serum
sadly i don't recommend ren evercalm anti-redness serum
this serum is just okay.
alcohol is the 3rd ingredient??
so you have to use a lot more than an oil-based serum
only when the serum is applied
i used this in conjunction with the evercalm lotion
i couldn't get this cleanser to foam at all
i dispise this cleanser.
this moisturizer was average.
while this is a cream that will moisturize
i do think that the cream has helped with puffiness
even added a drop of argon oil-the cream
the consistency of the cream
i did tons of research on c serums
today after wearing it layered with my other serums
this moisturizer is super light weight
my skin is combination
moisturizing when i first put it on
was excited about the "moisturizing properties" this product claimed to have
have an appropriate dry skin care regimen
this cleanser is nothing special.
by the night cleanser
i am not going to repurchase this product because it is not moisturizing
this product is pretty effective at removing makeup while gently exfoliating the skin
i received this cleanser with my foreo
the awakening radiance yogurt was very drying
for the price i don't think this moisturizes or hydrates my skin better than any other moisturizer
with a gel-like consistency
not at all what i expect from a hydrating mask
moisturizing is something that can be accomplished for much less money
still need to use cleanser afterwards
since i don't like to wear moisturizer under my makeup
like the idea of using a hydrating mask that i can wash off before applying my makeup
not hydrating at all
pills on the skin
this herbal cleanser smells like men's cologne
having tried many other 'clean' moisturizers
if i need a moisturizer on the fly
i really like the way this cream moisturizers
find an all natural day time moisturizer
i do not recommend this moisturizer
how moisturizing it is
i suppose it's the patented echinacea complex
it cause patchiness from the moisturizer
assumed i would love this moisturizer
under my lipstick or balm
so these small jars are perfect for storing with my lipsticks
what better time to whip out my sample bag of hydrating skin lotions
as it is pretty moisturizing
while using this moisturizer
there is no way to layer this with sunscreen let alone makeup
using it before bedtime
pills all over my face
look for another day moisturizer
did not give any benefits other than moisturizing
i much prefer other moisturizers to this one
which i think smells like soy sauce
i wanted to love this lotion
product was okay to use for daily moisturizer
it was not super moisturizing though
however it does work as a daily radiance booster under moisturizer
i think my other serum
you know those moisturizers or oils or lotions that will sit on the surface of your skin
take a few vitamin capsules
based on the claims that this is a gentle soap
made natural soap with activated charcoal ingredient at the top of the list
i wanted to switch to natural skin care products
my skin seems to do far better with argan or jojoba oils
not really hydrating for this combo/oily/dry patches from tretinoin skin
i do recommend the aloe after sun spray from them though
sensitive skin that i've discovered prefers facial oils over many other moisturizers
still not 100% sold on this brands skin oils.
will stick with herbivore's rose/hibiscus spray layered under my favorite moisturizer
i will say that i use a gentle bha liquid exfoliant daily in my nighttime skincare routine so maybe that's why i didn't notice any results
my concealer was patchy when mixed with it
if it didn't make the concealer crease
this is a very nice moisturizing eye cream
i wanted to find a hydrating eye cream
bought this for hydration
the moisturizing effect here is not adequate for my needs
i wanted to like this serum
my makeup seems to pill when i use this in the mornings
i liked the herbal scent
it's basically like soy sauce in a bottle.
the serum takes a long time to dry
the echinacea smell is overwhelming
this serum gives me red bumps after i apply it.
t doesn't leave white streaks after using the serum
even tried using a variety of face creams
all seem to float on top of the serum
will switch back to my pricier usual face serum
it does pill when placed over serum or oil
i've used this serum religiously every morning
with additional sunscreen over top for four months
figured i would switch up my day time moisturizer with this serum
found that water-based serums containing vitamin c oxidize very quickly
the serum is shown online as being a pale peach color
turns out it was the vitamin c serum.
the serum did nothing for my skin
the baby facial from the br
looks as if i want the % of in my serum
after checking with my dermatologist
i immediately stopped using the serum
wanted to renew it with the glycolic
natural vitamin c product that is noncomedogenic
continue to use this day serum
i wish it is unscented like the others...
the other serums/face oils/moisturizers i have been using for the past few months have been kind to my skin
i decided to go makeup free with just serum
sunscreen an boy was i glowing naturally
the framboos glycolic nigh serum
the b-hydra gel
i hated this serum
this vitamin c serum broke me out so bad
wanted to love this serum.
would be the best way to see if your skin will tolerate vitamin c
while this serum did make my skin smooth
it really darkens my skin even if i have sunscreen on
you have to either use a moisturizer or makeup over it to reduce the stickiness
it has a thicker serum consistency.
even with my sunscreen on top
this serum made me break out.
the serum applies extremely sticky
:( i had to switch to another vitamin c serum.
i deal with mild acne
followed with my daily moisturizer
used this for about a week as a daytime moisturizer
it did absolutely nothing in terms of moisturizing my skin
it reminds me more of a primer than a moisturizer
i love any facial product.
it's not particularly moisturizing
isn't it supposed to be a moisturizer?
it's not too moisturizing for a night cream
i wanted to try a new moisturizer
i love foamy cleanser.
it feels like mens shaving cream!
followed it with my toner
like you're applying shaving cream to your face
it really is like washing your face with shaving cream
it's face soap with the same chemicals used in drug store cleansers
this face cleanser does a fine job.
i've never used a mousse cleanser
i wear a lot of waterproof mascara
it feels like shaving cream
i followed with my moisturizer
i wish they made an unscented version.
when they discontinued the previous version of this serum
it is almost as if they are using up old packaging for the serum
started using my other serum which i like a lot better
it is almost like a gel.
i would appreciate it being much more moisturizing
it also made my under eye concealer
you can find a great hydrating eye cream for cheaper
i like this eye cream because is it very moisturizing
not very moisturizing, either.
it moisturizers, so i have it 3 stars.
this wasn't moisturizing enough for my dry skin.
lightening of my hyperpigmentation spots
it worked for my hyperpigmentation
most glycolic acid products i buy show results right away
make sure to apply over a light moisturizer
wear sunscreen because no lie without it you will burn
i wore 80 spf sunscreen.
i'be tried a few other vitamin c serums
i realized that the serum was actually the source of tiny blackheads
used sunscreen as recommended.
when i have an acne breakout there is postinflammatory hyperpigmentation
night along with spf 30 lotion
this serum, however, i'm not sure if it works.
as my friend uses the same serum
there is hydroquinone is this serum
perhaps the other ingredients/chemicals in this serum do more damage than the hydroquinone by itself
immediately purchased this serum
this serum also feels a little dry.
i added this to my skin care regimen hoping it would fade my acne scars
more blackheads that this product contains sodium laureth sulfate
since this is just a cleanser
the jojoba beads were nice for scrubbing
i would prefer a cleanser without sls
the exfoliating beads are too tiny
love how the ending result was moisturizing
i used it to remove my eyeshadow
i used it with the perfecting lotion
would recommend you use this cleanser with a moisturizer if you dry skin
i would not use it as a daily cleanser
she assured me that if i used a hydrating toner
moisturizer it would counteract the effects
because i'm sure other parts of life like diet
this cleanser is no
no moisturizer would help
the menthol in this soap irritated my skin
this cleanser didn't help my acne at all
this cleanser was not helpful in treating my acne
not one for acne
this cleanser was huge compared to all other cleansers i've purchased from sephora
my dermatologist gave me an antibiotic cream for my acne
the hunt for an effective anti-acne cleanser goes on :
it's called a topical wrinkle filler
one of the worst hyaluronic acid products
this cleanser didn't smell like blue tansy at all
in the cleanser form
i see the "sugar-based cleanser" part
was not enough of an exfoliant
this cleanser is more of a gentle scrub.
too pricey to use as an everyday cleansing balm
the scrub melts into the balm as you massage it
ratio of scrub to balm seems off
as i'd expect with any cleanser
not as moisturizing as i won't want.
smell of this cleansing balm
cleansing grains are hard to rinse out
exfoliating mask after taking my makeup off with another product
then i used this as a mild moisturizing scrub.
when i used toner after using only this
i love cleansing balms to remove my makeup.
actually has little exfoliate particles
it is also very moisturizing so beware if you have oily skin
have been using this as a hydrating mask
this cleansing balm contains caprylic/capric triglyceride
it is a form of coconut oil
do i like cleansing balms???
this balm has an initially grainier texture than other balms
oiler balm like the elemis pro collagen
the only benefit it provides is moisturizing.
the serum doesn't even peel me enough to remove blackheads
not what i like in facial moisturizer
oh well, i prefer mineral sunscreens anyway.
it has the texture of sunscreen
didn't moisturize my skin in the least
i love how moisturizing it is
bought the cleansing butter.
when i use the toner with a cotton pad after
i would only use this as a makeup remover
it would be 5 stars as a makeup remover.
unlike the thermal cleansing balm
the thermal cleansing balm uses just a dab
try the foaming omorovicza cleanser
