look how much dimethicone is in it.
this just seems to make it more oily
because i find this product almost unpleasant
hence this is good for those with dry skin.
my skin loves this at nighttime to give intense hydration without being too much on my combo-oily skin
it also left my skin feeling very oily/greasy for the next couple days
it did not moiturize my combination dry skin.
there are a lot of other creams out there that also soothe my skin without the price tag
results in the morning did not produce oily skin or breakouts
i would recommend for dry skin
not oily or combo
it almost felt like i was rubbing lard on my face
it is way too sticky
doesn't seem to soak in
i can still touch my face
i would not recommend for oily or combination skin
may work for you if you have very dry skin
i tend to have combination to dry skin
doesn't sink into the skin that much
it might be good for someone with dryer skin
at a minimum did not irritate my skin
this cream did not absorb into my skin at all
as long as i remembered to put it on every morning i didn't get the usual flaky patches i tend to get on my cheeks
does not feel like it sinks into my skin
i wish it would not leave a sticky feeling on my skin
it always left my face really sticky.
other than making it even drier at times
this cream could be great for people with really dry skin
climate:-normal to dry-dry to very dry
it didn't do anything for my dry patches
actually my dry patches have somehow become worse
on the upside things tend to burn my skin
i needed to wash it off
either too oily or too dry
the only cool thing i'll give is that it's a mask you can peel
it was so fun to peel off
you will probably never see a cooler looking mask on
until i realized that it only feels tightening because the alcohal content in the mask is just drying out my skin which in the long run ends up aging you quicker
i've found much cheaper peel off masks do a better job at firming than this one
it's hard to peel off unless you put on a lot
the chemicals in it must be so harsh because the foil seal in mine had been melted by the product
when i finally did my oily skin was so dry
what's great about this particular peel off mask is that you don't have to glob it on to make a thick layer in order for it to peel off easily
the regular peel off masks hurt your skin- this one does not
it feels like it's tightening while drying
it did not leave visible burn on my skin overall
they can feel like burning too
spend it on the super mud instead
other peel offs that claim take the same about to dry are ready to go
while this is still sticky
i will say that it is not successful while taking a bath or in a steamy environment
while it can make it feel plumped up
though it does have a cool application
the finish is pretty sticky
i really like their face wash
i decided to go with one that's specifically for dry skin
it also doesn't seem to soak in all the way
except maybe irritate my face a little
it did feel sticky/tacky when dried
i probably wouldn't buy a full bottle because of the pilling
my skin gets a lot of bumps all over the day after i use it
didn't offer any hydration in my opinion- instead left a tacky film residue on my face
i didn't find any impact on the elasticity or suppleness or find that my skin did any faster healing while using this product
if i were to buy it again it would be to layer with a decent moisturizer in the dry winter months
i think maybe it made my skin less dry?
was hoping for it to help my dry skin
takes a moment or two to dry
my skin doesn't like using too heavy of products
this product would prob be best for extremely dry skin
i could easily find something that moisturizes just as well
let it sit for 5 min before putting my moisturizers on
even make an order of moisture balm for my boss every few months
texture would have been alright if it would absorb
i did not find it particularly "hydrating" either
did not irritate my skin
still a little dry after using this
by the end of the day my face got excessively oily
think an extra layer would've been complete chaos for my skin
can get dry at times
if it just left my skin tacky
the stickiness it leaves combined with the breakouts makes me not willing to pay $75 to continue using it once my sample is empty
not that it dried me out.
it leaves a tacky finish to the skin which you would think would work well for putting foundation over
i tend to wear it lightly on just the areas where i'm beginning to notice sun aging
find that it absorbs quickly even though i have relatively oily skin
maybe a little worse because it made my face less soft
i find that i have to powder it down otherwise my undereyes area looks greasy
when you put powder over it, it looks great.
i do notice that it doesn't crease as bad after using this eye cream
it did feel like it took a while for this stuff to absorb into the skin
i wouldn't recommend this without makeup for those of us with really bad dark circles/eye bags
good thing is it does moisturize my eyes area with no grease
it doesn't ever seem to sink into the skin
it literally just felt like i was putting some normal everyday moisturizer on
i really like the extra moisture around my tires eyes
just stick to my eye cream which does work way better
you're not supposed to use retinol during the day because of its reaction with sunlight
they all about the eyes rich is good for treating early aging skin
it definitely did not lighten or take the puffiness out of my under eyes
i find it lightens them a little bit when i use it at night
every time you close it some product squirts out
it doesn't do much for my dry skin
i don't find it to do as it claimed to mask my sleep deprived under eyes
it also didn't do anything for the dryness.
this is a great product for those who sometimes get dry around the eyes
one thing that annoys me a lot is that the applicator doesn't glide on as smooth as i would like it
you have to put a lot of product for it to work without pulling on the delicate skin under your eyes
this made my skin look like i rubbed bacon grease all over my face after being outside for 10mins
even in the smallest dose unfortunately this cream was greasy for my normal skin
it leaves a shiny oily feeling on my skin even if i use just a little
it'll make your face slick
if i don't blot often
there's a thick oily film on my t-zone
even a tiny bit will burn for a long time.
i ordinarily have dry skin that never breaks out.
i am guessing it would make anyone with normal/oily skin break out too
didn't really soak in to my skin
my skin seems more oily than usual
all this cream has done is dry me out even more
want to avoid any more sun damage
it completely dried out my skin which is strange for an overnight cream
i do not remember it containing meadowsweet
go back to my winter product murad hydro-dynamic™ ultimate moisture
the benefits are undone by all the exfoliating necessary to keep your skin clear while using it
doesn't last long as it rubs off easily
i can say that it seems like you have to use a lot of the product to get the thick pads to stay on your eye area
seems to stick to the pad too much when you take it off rather than the eye
using the pads doesn't make the product do
the pads that you put on under your eyes on top of the cream will not stay on
this stuff really dried my skin out
i found that greasy
this product is very drying to the face.
it tingles in a bad way when you apply it
putting liquid foundation on over this is a nightmare because the foundation does not spread over it smoothly
you might as well flush your money down the toilet if you're considering buying this
it also flakes off when you apply make up.
it was as if i were trying to apply make-up over white glue
let those layers dry for about 5 or so minutes.
it definitely can make you break out so clean your face thoroughly in the morning
i also read that you need to use silk pillowcases to really help save your face
i know satin was always good to sleep on if you wanted to keep your hairstyle longer
it reminds me of the numbing cream they give you when you get fillers
i felt this depleted my already dry aging skin
have normal to dry skin
all this did was make my skin dry
my makeup was going on awful as well because it really disrupted the texture of my skin
it was very thick and i could feel it on my face.
i still found it to be greasy
i wake up with a very oily face???
it didn't absorb into my skin at all
maybe if you have drier skin this would work for you
for someone with dry to very dry skin i am sure it would feel great
i don't suffer from extreme dry skin.
i do get winter dry
i think if you have younger skin it's smoothing feel may work
the pros-it didn't irritate my skin
i liked how it felt when she sprayed it on my skin
my skin seems to soak in this product almost immediately
it hasn't decrease my oily areas or "drenched" my dry areas
if you look for natural ingredients in your skin care products this isn't for you
it dried out my skin beyond belief.
after applying to my face i felt dry- no'quenching' that i could discern
not loving having to spray it onto my h
my face did become a little oily post application
now i'm using my old mask trying to correct all the mess i have on my skin
my skin feels fresh after using it however i'm not sure it did something to clear my pores
typically do not have sensitive skin
giving it 2 stars cause at least it didn't irritate my super sensitive skin
i still feel like i need a toner after
i didn't like the product i have combination skin specially dry lately well this didn't help
does help with my oily skin in the morning
this product is a decent face wash
when i combined it with this soap it really makes a difference
unfortunately i feel like this product caused my face to become shiny
it only foams once you try to get it off your skin
however, it made my skin so dry and so flakey.
it could be good for normal to oily skin
not for dry skin
it dried me out so bad
it dried my skin out so bad that my face
might be better to use on a day that you want a deep cleanse for your skin
didn't make my skin dry
save your money, get the mask.
did absolutely nothing for my dry skin
this isn't great if you have dry skin that is also sensitive/acne prone
it dried me out so bad that i flaked
if you are usually dry
i think 1 hour is enough to melt.
i find that the liquid in the daily roller is not very easy to distri
the moisturizer doesn't fully absorb into the skin which results in it balling up if you put anything overtop of it
it feels a lot like the body butter which i love.
flakes ruining anything you put on
doesn't seem to sink in just seems to clump together on my face
let's start off by saying that josie maran milk is one of my favorite facial products ever in life
it feels like dry mask on your face after 5 minutes of aplication
i don't like the feeling of product on top of the skin
maybe from the oil
unfortunately it pilled on my skin
i can't use a toner with it or it balls up.
mix that with this product to get the level of moisture i like
i feel like once it soaks in it leaves a film that you can feel once you wash your face later in the day
in fact i think it leaves a residue on my skin
i do think its nice as a night cream when my skin is very dry
i may just switch to using it for a night cream if i can find a different day moisturizer that my skin can tolerate
the only downside is that it makes me super oily within 30 mins i look so oily
not for my skin type
all it did was leave me with dry skin
dry skin when it's suppose to give a glow
perhaps it's because i have dry skin
if you like scrubbing your face
letting it sit there without any benefits of the lotion
one just for being convenient for when you don't want to use another product to exfoliate your face
it left my skin a bit dry sometimes
so this does not leave my skin dry
i guess it is just a good after make up cleanser.
murad's daily cleansing foam causes less dryness for me for whatever reason
because it actually washes off clean
i am not a fan of this refreshing cleanser--it also leaves a weird tight residue on my skin that i feel like i need to wash off again as soon as i towel off from cleansing
not many can make my skin clean enough to avoid breakouts
it was non-drying, but that's about all.
i could rub lemons on my face for an hour
may be better for someone with oily
as soon as anything burns i give it maybe a minute to see if it disappears
only used this on oily areas like my t-zone
the actual texture of the mask is really easy to apply
feels doesn't dry up like most charcoal masks
i did love that this product was not drying at all because i have sensitive/combination skin
the only bonus of this mask: it is not drying
f you do have dry skin
it's just like a cream that doesn't absorb into the skin
i found it to be very drying.
didn't seem to soak into my skin as well
i switched from sunday riley's luna thinking my dry winter skin might benefit from some extra moisture
it was good for hot weather
it takes a little bit to sink into my skin
it didn't make me break out or leave my skin oily or dry or anything bad
two of my dry faced friends with long term use said it made their skin flake
it was hard to apply my face cream or oil over this
like i hadn't washed my face at all
i am giving it 2 stars because it did make my pores basically invisible everywhere
it won't help if your lips are chapped
i love it for patches on my elbows that tend to get dry
doesn't really absorb into my lips by rather makes them feel dry soon after
all day long i had to blot my face because it was so greasy so the next day i put a very minimal amount thinking maybe i just used too much
it just gets so oily and gross.
is neither slick nor sticky
i prefer a little extra moisture at night
not a fan of the rollerball applicator- i dont feel like enough oil comes out for me
it does a good job of locking in moisture
has done wonders for my dry skin
then it has a roller ball that you apply the oil to your face
it doesn't absorb into my skin at all.
it made me so greasy
i would only use this oil for hair or body
already have oily skin on my face so didn't try that
only 3 stars since a rollerball doesn't mean i will be buying for use as an all over body oil
while it did soak in quickly
this is good if you have dry skin
you don't mind looking oily
i love the stick toner so far!
it did not add moisture or any benefit to my skin at all
either extremely dry or extremely oily
too oily to try to use on face
could imagine oily skin types would hate it too
i do like the cooling feeling.
thought this would help with my dry skin
is it meant to cool you off whole in the sun?
it feels like a thick sticky mask no matter how little you put on or how much you rub it in
it doesn't sink in
cool when you first apply it
to be fair my skin isn't particularly dry or problematic
after it "dried" down it was still super tacky.
now i have to deal with super sticky skin until i wash my face for the night
maybe rhis could be a good makeup primer cause of how sticky it is lol
feels like if you put cooling menthol chap stick under your eyes
so probably good after being sunburnt
its good for dry patches, but it isn't cooling.
i didn't feel like it cooled my face or under eyes at all
all it did was make my face feel sticky
it did leave a waxy residue behind which was a bit strange
tacky feeling actually makes my undereye area secret more oil throughout the day
it is a nightmare to apply in the middle of the day when you feel dehydrated because it is way too greasy
i suggest you to drink more water throughout the day
all it does is makes your face sticky for half
you can't use it as a primer because its too sticky
it doesn't really de-puff your face
the only thing i did notice was that it left my skin looking glowy
the smell after less than 5 min is awful on your skin
or mess things up if i reapply it during the day
that makes it impossible for a quick refresh at work without having to touch your face
it feels almost watery when you apply it
apparently if you stick it in the fridge
then use it -- even cooler
i don't see what the purpose of this product is other than giving you a cooling sensation--which really only lasts during the application while it's touching your skin
just like somebody washed the table cloth
didn't dry it properly… why this is called cooling water?
lately it does not provide enough moisture for my skin
it now has a lot of dimethicone in it
which in my case does not do as well as physical sunblock
when everyone knows you need at least 30 spf for daily sun protection
it also didn't do much for the oil on my forehead or nose
i don't really think it did much for my skin in terms of pores or blemishes
thus making it even more oily
however it was too thick for me
i now use it under my eyes for extra moisture there during the day
its actually kind of thick
no matter how little i used my skin didn't soak it in at all
this didn't agitate my skin
this stuff made my oily skin even more oily
those two products combined really dried out my skin
my skin would get so greasy
immediately after use it left your face with a little shine which was annoying
sometimes when i applied it to flaky skin i felt that i couldn't put enough on because it wouldn't really moisturize that well
if you apply too much it sits on your skin without absorbing
my t-zone area still got oily / shiney which this claims to prevent
it also did nothing for my pores.
not only did it break me out its so dry
it didn't my skin was dry
i noticed that my face gets very oily as time passes
it did nothing to even my skin tone or minimize my pores
it's thin but not as creamy as i had hoped
but really dries out my skin.
this did not clean my makeup off good also after cleansing two times it still felt like i had something on my face i had to use another cleanser to get it off
it does sting if it runs into your eye
this seems just like a toner to me
either steaming your face or pressing a towel soaked in warm water to your face before masking gives better results than this
then insanely dry if i tried to remove that residue
there wasnt any extra hydration other than my masks
if you want your face masks to work better just stream or use hot water on the face so the pores are open
my only use for this product now is as a face mist
i can see how it would be helpful with clay masks by keeping them moist while you apply to the rest of your face
my skin is pretty “normal”, not oily nor dry.
t doesn't irritate my skin
afterwards my skin didn't feel tight or dry
you may as well spray water on your face.
the product one felt like it may have given my skin a little hydration
it's not making the product come out evenly
i don’t doubt that using this product immediately before applying your mask will help to make it easier to spread your mask on evenly
it may make it easier to rinse off
the same functions can be achieved with spritzing on any toner you have lying around
it’s no easier than running a washcloth under hot water
it's like shooting yourself in the face with a high pressure hose
the spray does not mist as one would expect
even when doing just half a spray each time
because the spray function is so awful this is going back
it makes mud type masks slide on a bit easier
it did nothing with my charcoal mask
which i use more because of my oily skin type
i feel like i have to scrub harder
your better off picking up purity
i found it way too drying for my dry sensitive skin
it only made my skin more dry
it feels like there is cleanser left on my face no matter how much i rinse
when i went to tone the cotton pad would be evidence that the skin was still not properly cleaned
did not strip my otherwise combination to oily dehydrated skin
like a dry oil almost
it also made my skin very prone to break outs when typically i get one or two pimples a month
feel this would be better for someone with oily skin
i can't get it to wash off my face.
t's pretty hard to dry my face out
doesn't leave it dry
it just does not add any moisture to my face.
i felt this dried me out even more
didn't leave me too dry
it doesn't make a lather at all.
it dried my face out so bad
it left this residue that was really hard to rinse off
it did foam up really well.
this wash didn't just give me 1 or 2 pimples it gave me about 10
i'll just stick to my drugstore face wash that works way better for me
there are 2 additional problems: it does not rinse off well
i get that many double wash anyway
could not rinse this stuff off.
it makes a crazy amount of foam when used with a clairsonic
it does not leave my skin smooth
just like the moisturizer i used formula isn't the same this one does nothing for my skin waste of money
this one dries out my skin way too much.
leaves your skin feeling as though you just used a cheap bar of soap
however it leaves your skin feeling like you just washed it with a bar of cheap soap- dry
i think this would work better for someone with oily skin or skin that is not sensitive
found it dried my face out terribly
would work for more oily skin types
unfortunately this cleanser is way too drying for me
was hoping there would be a cleanser for very dry skin
i didn't feel as though it was really cleaning my skin
still find make up residue on the wipe
i don't feel like my skin is clean after using it
become so dry that i had to go back to my old cleanser
the first night i used it i found i had to rinse my face much longer than usual
not really washing off
it was a bit drying as well
it would never "sink" into my skin
once i put it on i felt like my skin couldn't breath
i never felt like the product fully absorbed into my skin
i also didn't like how it did under my bare minerals powder as i felt like it made my lines
as long as you don't use too much it dries well
which is just too drying for my skin
this might be best for oily skin.
it ended up to be my body lotion which was still not enough in winter
it's not best for oily or combination skin types
it makes my t-zone more oily
wouldn't recommend for oily skin types.
as a contact lens wearer it was even worse because the contacts themselves would dry out completely
will not repurchase until the fix the formula so that it doesn't feel so greasy/sticky
sometimes my skin just tingles a little when i try new products
which i never get from the cream
it just doesn't work for oily congested skin.
greasy like i never wash my face
it did give me moisture
i think exposure to air made it go bad?
even though i have dry skin
it burns if you get it anywhere near your eye area
the more i used it the more i could smell the rancidity
it made my face flakey which is most likely the alcohol
i feel like the product doesn't really absorb compared to other body oils i use
i can't have alot of creaminess on my face because it makes me break out i think it would work great on dry skin
this product was a little to sticky for me.
can't say it absorbs quickly either
is that why this makes my face dry
my problem is mainly that it makes my face extremely dry which doesn't make sense at all
i feel like i have to use a lot to make my skin actually moisturized
this is great to put under makeup because it doesn't leave skin oily or greasy
while this does moisturizer my face it does sting once it's on
good if you can get pass the stinging sensation
instead of doing what it claims to do it dried my skin out
honestly just clogs your skin without helping it.
when my skin was dry from the winter
definitely not meant for dry skin :
dry or mature probably wouldn't go for this because it feels very gel like
if your an oily skin gal you would probably like this because it doesn't leave a creamy oil feeling behind
they don't actually nourish the skin
i left it on for a bit to see if it would sink into my skin
it not only made my skin dry
it makes my normal/dry skin feel basically like the desert
definitely not for those with dry skin as advertised
i could see this being great for someone with oily skin
want to use a product that's going to moisturize your skin long time/long term
it just wasn't enough moisture for my skin it seems
unfortunately i was continuously trying to compensate for the lack of moisture
just make sure the moisturizer you use is helping your skin rather than just adding another layer to it
this one in specific left me skin dry
it somehow left my skin dry
it actually leaves my skin feeling drier than if i hadn't put it on at all
you can achieve the same results just tapping your eye with your fingers
this cleaning oil did not work at all for me.
once you throw away the box you will never know what's in the creme to begin with since the ingredients are not printed on the actual tub
my skin was so oily it took two face washes to rid it of the excess oil
i think it would be great for folks with dry skin
for some reason it gave me pimples on my cheeks where i rarely get them
i do love the moisture
they weren't very moist
does give u some moisture.
this one is way too slippery
not intense enough for dry winter skin.
there was no moisture
it just does not seem to line up to seal tight.
i've tried squeezing a little serum off so they would be a little less wet
i still get dry patches every now
'd like to get something that provides a bit more moisture throughout the day
it does not irritate my skin at all
trying to fix it with a beauty blender only makes it look worse
i figured if it wasn't moisturizing enough for my night time routine i could just layer my face cream over it
while it does hydrate your eyes i have not seen any difference with dark circles
my concealer just slides around when i try to apply it too soon
didn't do anything in terms of firmness or pores.
t takes a bit of work with wet fingers
my face does well with many different oils.
to me it just smells/feels like i'm smearing canola oil all over my face
didn't absorb at all
really bad product made my skin dry out
it's good if you have oily skin
dehydrated no matter how much i put on
maybe good for combo or oily skin
i typically have to let it sink in
additionally i did not feel like my skin was more moisturized when i woke up in the morning
even tried layering it a few times
i get super dry
this night mask did very little except for keeping my skin from drying during sleep
my night cream does more for me then this mask.
my face is super dry
i don't have dry skin
maybe it's because i already have dry skin
after applying it i looked like a hot, oily mess.
it didn't irritate my sensitive skin in any way
the only thing i don't like about this product is that when i open the flip lid to use the cream highlighter
it would be good for someone with dry to combo skin
as long as its not too hot or humid of a day it stays okay
if it gets too hot or humid then i turn into a grease ball
makes me oily around the t-zone after application
even though i am not usually very oily
this product is great if you don't have oily skin
i am not a fan of using the lotion they gave because it makes my skin very oily
i look way too tan with this so unfortunately it does not look like the within glow
i just wish these products would be shimmery as opposed to having actual glitter pieces in them
i like the way it felt on my dry skin
le the smell especially since its going on my face reminding me that i'm putting chemicals on my skin
what i didn't like is how it will peel when layering with other products
sink in for a good amount of time
it did however leave me a bit oily by the end of that day
it also gave me three huge blackheads on my cheek where i usually would never get them
where i tend to get oily
have gotten my skin into a really good routine without any more breakouts
i live in a very humid climate
the feeling of my oily spots becoming even more oily
i imagine that if you have dryer skin that isn't prone to breaking out this might work
definitely do not wear it under foundation or your face is going to peel off
it didn't leave me dry
doesn't absorb very well
unfortunately it was just too heavy for me for daily wear
doesn't feel refreshing aside from the cool sensation you get from any gel/cream going on your face
i felt like i had to use a lot in order for my skin to not feel dry
at first when i applied it it felt like my skin just started to sweat profusely
bought this due to dry winter skin.
soy face wash then i find it works way better
i don't even have dry skin
this was so lightweight i had to apply another moisturizer 15 minutes after this one because my skin felt so parched
found it to be sticky
if you truly have dry skin
when i mix with any other products it starts to peel off
the only thing it did was give my eyes a tingling while i applied it
or even out the texture of my skin any more than if i had just used a regular moisturizer
even after you've let it dry for a good 20 mins
is not hydrating enough if you use anything that is hard on the skin
i would only recommend this to someone with oily/very oily skin
it does end up looking very glowy
as a person that has a normal-dry skin type
i'd recommend this to those with normal-oily skin types
when i use this under my makeup i can really see that it's not as hydrating as it claims
this is just too dry to be wore alone
i don't really see my skin completion looking any better or smoother thought it does leave my skin feeling really nice after it dries all of the way down
nose can get pretty oily by mid-day
it also feels a bit sticky for a while after application
if anything it made it feel even dryer
really hate the sticky feeling that i got right after applying it
do not moisturizes dry areas as i wanted it to
my cheeks that are more dry do not get enough
after that my skin started getting dry in areas
this does nothing for my dry areas
i asked the sephora worker to help me pick out something that wouldn't be too oily to cause my face to get pimples
i almost think it makes it more dry in some places of my face
it makes me look oily even under a full face of make up
definitely not a home run for those with dry skin
it also didn't leave that overly dewey or greasy feeling i hate from most face lotions
the gel doesn't even come out when i tried to pump it
this product claims that using this will be like a "cool glass of water for your thirsty skin
for me it doesn't provide enough moisture
i still go over it with argan oil to not feel dry
it is too light to the point that it doesn't even give the slightest moisture
still hoping for it to help keep more moisture in my skin
it did absorb pretty well into my oily skin though
then the new formula might seem ok to my virgin skin?
once it goes on my skin
because it takes all the life out of your skin
i want to see it foam
it is too gentle which almost does nothing on my skin
then while washing the "mask" off it didn't feel like it was cleaning much
it did a decent job at cleaning my skin
it says to leave it on until it foams up
it didn't really foam up
this mask didn't seem to do anything for me at all except leave my skin feeling kind of tacky even after i'd washed it
the next day my face was much oilier than usual
when you rub it in
i just can't wait to rinse it off
if you are expecting a mask that would foam
think this is not for dry skin for sure
dont expect some thick foam to develop
i think this is drying on the under eye area
when you move your face you feel it crack on the surface meaning it never absorbed in
that was so dry
it even pilled after putting it on without any moisturizer
i don't have dry or flakey skin
this stuff seemed to absorb
then the flakiness would start
little refreshing but so is rose water.
my problem - it dried out my skin.
my skin was an oily mess
i am not usually the oily type
that is so bad for your skin
in the long run it will dry out your skin
it was sticky on my face
it does dry a little "stiff" or "sticky"
did not help texture or fine lines
it is so glittery that without washing my face again in the morning my dr jart bb didn't even look normal due to the glitter
when you put it on your skin
does not fade fast enough before i get nauseated
it does absorb well
except that it felt slightly drier than usual
i find this very sticky
i don't like putting it on my face by itself because it has a slightly sticky texture
i worry about putting fragrance on my face since i have sensitive skin
i laugh every time it squirts in places other than where it should go
i dont feel that my skin is that clean after washing
i would not recommend if you have sensitive or dry skin
it was almost like a film on my face that made me look oily
definitely not for dry skin!
it has all the ingredients that supposedly good for your skin
it definitely dried out my face
i love the added skin benefits because i feel like i'm doing something extra for my skin other than just washing it
i always found myself scrunching my nose at the smell of this stuff even after i used up the entire bottle
just be careful using with wet h
turns out it just needs a lot of water to lather properly
i kind of mimic washing my face with just water before using to ensure that my h
face are thoroughly wet
i've also noticed that while this cleanser itself doesn't seem to irritate my skin
eye cream was good, not oily at all!
it does dissipate quite a bit after a few minutes
i find i have to stir it every other day or 'oily' bits will seep to the top
i find this stuff is too "fluid".
i don't need super moisture
i loved the light scent of this cream as well as the cooling feeling you get when applying it
i just couldn't get over the texture
this product doesn't really absorb into the skin too well
when i use it i feel it leaves a greasy coat on my skin that doesn't absorb
i don't have oily skin
it doesn't absorb all that well into skin.
doesn't go on oily
this does not give a ton of moisture
sticky finish on your face
i really loved it for hydration during the harsh winter without being slick
as soon as it gets on my oily skin
skin is still dry and it did zero brightening.
didn't think it was good enough for the winter time since i still had some dry skin spots
after leaving it on overnight i would notice dry flakey patches that weren't there in the first place
did not break out my sensitive skin
unfortunately i didn't get to use it long enough to find out because it started clogging my pores
this product now makes me peel.
while it doesn't feel at all greasy it looks greasy
what an oily mess!
although it claims to be for all skin types it does not work for oily skin
but, i would not recommend it for oily skin.
this makes me an oil slick
doesn't irritate my skin at all
nor irritating to turn my skin into a red itchy mess which i appreciate
my skin will be back in dry mode
literally makes little skin looking flakes when i put my foundation over it
acne didn't go anywhere, skin is just coming off.
in fact i'm finding i'm having to use another moisturizer on top of this one as my skin feels dry
two to three drops just isn't enough to cover your whole face
with the humid climate my skin needed some help
the salicylic acid is going to do zero for almost anyone
when i couldn't find a new tube
all these creams have the same idea of light weight "water based" formulas that are good for oily skin because its not heavy
does not appear greasy
maybe better for combo or oily skin.
doesn't absorb at all
it feels like my face is more dry then before
not a good product for someone with oily/combination skin like me
your skin isn't dry
it seemed to really dry my skin out
it does sink in very quickly
my skin felt even drier than it had before putting this product on
its like a thickish face primer consistency when you first squeeze it out
also sometimes as a makeup primer if i'm feeling something really like
it's hilarious that it tells you to apply it sparingly because it absorbs into the skin so fast that you kind of need to put a lot in order to even cover your face
i wouldn't recommend for dry skin.
it just feels like you're patting water onto your face
i didn't feel like it made my skin sticky like some other reviewers
it did sink in extremely quickly
it feels like you're just splashing plain water on your face
or for someone who is all over oily
not enough moisture led to me being "oily dry" which led to more breakouts than i've seen since i was a teen
"oily-dryness" happens when your skin is producing too much oil to compensate for dryness
i don't have horribly dry skin
this is not for combo or oily skin
it really does not provide the moisture my skin needs
if you suffer from dry skin
it doesn't give enough moisture alone
i normally have oily skin so not underst
it made me feel like i put something on that zapped any ounce of natural moisture i had
yes--somehow my skin actually felt even more dry after putting this on
it kind of feels like it sits ontop of my skin without melting into it
it does nothing for my dry skin
it doesn't feel thick or sticky i just wish it was actually hydrating because then it would be perfect
but i find this to be too drying.
i don't describe my under eye area as dry either.
she has skin that tends to be on the dry side.
wasn't enough for my aging skin
though it's winter, i have oily/combination skin.
it almost feels sticky
i know it is the moisturizer because my skin will be clear until i use one
my combo face dries out pretty badly between dry winter air
it may have also given me oily skin
my skin is really dry in the winter.
unfortunately this felt very drying
that can really dry out your skin
you need a lot of moisture to smooth the fine lines
this one did not cut the cake on my dryness
i didn't see an improvement on my texture or dry patches day or night
it does get cakey like.
cooling it is when you apply it
almost like it needs a little more of a liquid consistency to go on smoothly
although my undereye bags seems to be a bit better
you don't have to touch your face with your fingers
it is definitely cooling because it is a balm you roll under your eyes
she basically told me that the purpose of the balm was just to act as a "starter product" to get you in the habit of using an eye cream if you don't have a routine that includes using one
keep you in the habit of taking one pill everyday so you keep with your routine
this does leave you with a cooling effect
it made my skin super oily which i wouldn't care if my fine lines didn't turn into wrinkles
i find that with the colder weather my skin is getting dry
it does apply sticky
the bar seemed to dry out my skin a lot.
be prepared for a mess in the shower
made a little bit of a mess in the shower
get 'sports bra' breakouts if not careful to wash with a product like this
i find it too drying on my face.
your face will soak it up" when i asked what the main ingredients were
it's winter here & i have very dry skin.
you can definitely layer it
still have to use a different product to moisturize since this product doesn't do the job
even making my skin look oily at times
my skin will feel dry when i wake up
this could be good for people with oily or combo skin
the only thing that was all over me was sweaty
didn't do much for a dark spot remover.
it feels just like i'm splashing some water on my face
i saw that you can use the product on to the cotton pad
you splash it on
this has dried out my face so bad
too bad that it takes more then then one to fully moisturize your face
i do feel the moisture
this leaves me more oily than usual
you only need to use 1-2 "beads" at a time to cover your face
after whatever hydrating step you do to trap the moisture
usage goes by very fast especially if you have dry skin
the moisture beads are already portioned so you do not need to worry about using too much product
in the jar they're sort of wet-looking
good enough for me to finish the jar
not oily or heavy
i feel it would interfere with my perfume if worn during the day
definitely returning if not i'm going to use it to coat the trees in my yard to protect them from bugs because that is about all its useful for
i once put some sunscreen over it too early
for my skin being on the drier side
it just did not work without it feeling too dry
it has a very weird sticky feeling once applied to the skin that i just couldn't h
i hated applying it to my face because of how sticky it was on my fingers
didn't work on my skin
the stickiness was not for me
it doesn't do much for adding moisture either
i didn't feel is soaked into my skin nicely
made me feel even drier than i already am
i gave it only 3 stars because the areas where i need the most make-up gripping is on my oily t-zone
i don't consider myself to have bad skin or big pores
i don't even get that oily during this time of the year even with my jm argan oil as a moisturizer
may work better for dry/normal skin
for my oily spots of the face my make up did not blend
made me more oily
made my dry skin look even more dry
even after 5 minutes this stuff doesn't soak in
stop being sticky/tacky on my skin
since it doesn't soak into my skin i leave it on my skin for at least 10 min or longer then i take the residue off with a moisturizing toner
it is hard to put on evenly at 1st as this product is quite thick
although this product does not dry out my skin
it does not actually fill-in or in anyway eliminate the lines on my forehead
i did find that it dries my face out a bit too much
i feel like i lose a lot in the shower
the first week of use my skin did peel slightly which i was fine with
pat it on my wet face
wait a bit then splash my face with water
i suspect it would work well on normal/oily/combination skin
is it possible for a product to make you more oily?
living in kentucky where it is very humid i have a very tough time not looking like you could fry on egg on my face with the amount of oil on it
i get as oily, or even oilier using this.
tried this many times and i have very oily skin.
each time it made my skin look dry
this might be nice for someone out there who has oily skin
it was just as oily as it usually becomes
if anything my nose seems shinier at the end of the day
when blended with moisurizer it made me more greasy somehow
it turned my foundation into a gummy mess that did not apply well
i usually get very oily in my t-zone throughout the day
i usually forget to blot anyway
using it after it just moves your foundation an its a mess am very oily
the only thing it did was making me foundation thicker
which doesn't really work because the product is so thick
saw how oily my akin
i noticed my skin getting greasier much quicker than if i had used no primer at all
except it never dried
even made me more oily than normal
i feel like most of the time it actually made me look oilier
this does nothing for oily skin!
about 6-7 hours into my day it doesn't help with my makeup getting oily
when i tried it under as a primer it didn't control my oils at all
this does nothing for reducing oil and shine.
my skin was still as oily with this product as it is without it
these drops didn't do a single thing for my oily skin
if anything, it made me oilier.
in the summer i just get very oily when its 100* out
i did like touching up with it because it seemed as if i had freshly applied my makeup
it just does not reduce the need to blot with paper
around my nose i can get oily
feel more oily with this
so far, my skin is still as oily as ever.
maybe i'll try it again mixed with a primer
i'll try it on my beauty blender when i get home to see if it removes the oil
your face goes back to being oily
it has so much silicone in it that my face feels so siliconeee when i touch it
this product did not reduce shine or oil at all
did not even keep me matte throughout the day.
still trying to find the one thing that gets rid of my extremely oily skin
nothing is a match for my oily skin
wonder if this product isn't for those with oily skin
i don't find it sticky
it is hard to use any liner or heavy eye make up after applying the cream
this may work better for dry skin.
oily people may experience too much of a shine
felt super oily all day
try it again in the colder months when my skin is more dry
no matter how much i warm it up on my fingers
my skin just feels like an oil slick after a couple of hours
hygienic since you don't need to use your fingers or a spatula to get the product out
it wasn't sufficient for my dehydrated skin since there was almost no "moisture" in it
it might be one for very dry skins
this cream feels good when you apply on the face.
/or live in a super dry climate
this might be a nice step to apply after your regular moisturizer to really seal in the moisture
the mechanism that was supposed to add air to give the whipped texture didn't work
it was way too oily on my combination.
i think this would be great for someone with normal to dry skin
it does hydrate on nights where i feel like i need a boost
for people with dry skin isn't enough
those really help your skin
not sure whether it is too oily for my skin.
i don't have dry or oily skin
it almost feels like a pore filling primer going all over your face
unfortunately my dry skin was neither quenched nor radiant
it might work for your skin
is just way too thick for my normal skin type
it is still to rich even for a night cream
i think this would be perfect for someone with a dry skin type though
i did my normal skin care routine
seems to sink no in without being to heavy
this didn't help with my dry patches
i feel it never absorbed completely into my skin
i did notice greasy skin
somehow the ingredients that are supposed to keep the oil at bay seemed to instead clog my pores
how does this go about control oiling when it wipes off?
so you have to be careful to apply this to your cheeks
it will emphasize any imperfections on the skin- i don't care as my skin is typically clear
nor does it provide much moisture at all
i expect it to be something that soaks into my skin
i think for dry skin this may work
my type of skin did not mix
this never seems to absorb into my skin very well
for some reason it doesn't sink in to my skin
alone it makes my face way too shiny
would recommend that anyone with dry skin use a different moisturizer underneath if you want to use this product
i typically don't even have sensitive skin
i don't have a super dry skin
on my combination skin anyway
the moisture was on point for me
didn't really notice much difference moisture-wise
unfortunately broke my skin out i have sensitive dry skin so that must be why
neither moisturizing nor glowy enough for me to even finish my play
my dry skin needs something much more potent.
if you are even slightly oily
i do not feel it is meant for oily skin
make my already oily/combo skin look worse
i wouldn't advise putting it all over your face as a moisturizer as intended unless you like an oily
i prefer a blurring moisturizer or at least one that doesn't accentuate things id prefer to hide
doesn't absorb completely perhaps because of the spf
it didnt really give me much moisture
add some more stuff to actually make my skin glow
i find it either dispenses too much product or actually shoots out from the bottle
i also didn't like how the cream kind of "shoots" out of the bottle
dried the heck out of my skin after one use.
it was so drying
will be sticking to that -- this made my face feel way too dry
that's simply because i like another variety of clinique face wash better
i didn't find it to be "purifying" -- i still got an occasional break out
i felt like i was never able to completely rinse this product off
is still excessively oily
i like how much it foams up
you don't keep face wash on for that long
stay on your mid cheek because it will abuse your skin
i found that the grains were really hard to rinse off your face
i would wash with it
i think i'll go back to soaping
not at all oily
may work for u if you have a drier skin type
it doesn't feel like it absorbs into my skin as much as other moisturizers i've used
a lot of my other skin care products react strange with it
doesn't feel greasy or heavy on the skin
doesn't leave a greasy sheen or anything
doesn't blend in well-left my skin sticky then dry-made for oily skin
it makes me look more oily
i would steer clear of this product if you wear sunscreen every day like me
after a few hours of wear it makes my skin really greasy looking when i wear it under foundation
maybe my skin was too dry
because it is so thick
it takes more than an hour for my skin to completely absorb it
i don't have dry skin though
being oily skin girl i was expecting way too much from this product
my makeup just kind of looked like a big oily mess
all it's done is make my oily skin worse
not for me, or for girls with super oily faces.
although i had to use a lot of product it did leave my skin feeling nice after exfoliating
my cc cream usually does a good job of oil control
when combined or layered over this it did not.
though it is silky smooth i think this would be best for those with normal to dry skin
did it saw it was for oily skin
not a good choice for a day use for anyone with oily skin
which in my opinion doesn't work well for oily skin people
this stuff made my face feel like i was 13 again going through puberty
that all the skin on my face was peeling like crazy
i feel that it will dry my skin some days
well for one i'm not a big fan of the silicone type feel primer
certain places can get dry while the rest will look really oily
if you like silicone products you may like this.
if you rub your face it will start to ball up
after applying or try throughout the day if rubbed at all it clumps into little balls on your face
so when you use this always wash it off your face at the end of the day
moisturizer into one you end up with one mediocre product
it didn't give me all that much moisture
it's perfect for when i just want to brush the powder on
my powder stays put longer, too.
especially as right out of the tube it felt like a primer
might work for folks with dry skin
if you rub your face a little
the lotion is basically "pilling" off if that makes any sense
if anything its worse because it looks like dry flecks of skin are coming off my face
my skin felt drier after i put this on
my skin is still dry in its usual areas
when the weather got warmer it started taking longer to be absorbed by my skin
it made my face oily
i really don't think this will be suitable for oily skins to be honest
i only use this product during the cold months to give my skin a moisture boost
when my skin is in a thirsty need this is what i used
it takes forever to fully soak into the skin if it ever does
i would only suggest using this as a spot treatment for super dry patches or if your skin in dry
i wouldn't use it with a liquid foundation either
which i've been trying to get away from as it definitely moisturizes
i do use mostly natural products which tend to be fragrance free so maybe that is why its overpowering to me?
unfortunately it didn't treat my skin well
moisture would love this stuff
doesn't leave ur skin oily or heavy smells good
it is not meant for oily skin
greasy like i said
wouldn't recommend it if you have a lot of acne or very oily skin
i also find that i need to use a lot of it to get the kind of moisture i do need on the parts of my face that are dry
as you rub the product in it gets a "tight" feel to it
it is just too thick
it's too fragranced for me to consider putting on my face
previously oily getting drier as i age
makes me break out, i have very oily skin.
i did not find it greasy
after applying it to my skin it literally felt as if i had a layer of grease on my skin
it is so slippery
acne prone or even live in a humid environment
it also takes too long to dry.
i can't even describe how my face melted by mid day
my skin was like an oil slick by the end of the day
even those of us with oily skin needs to hydrate so our skin doesn't produce excess oil
this product does not give you enough hydration to satisfy your skin
would not recommend to anyone with dry skin
the only thing i can do is use the boscia charcoal blot papers then come back with a loose powder
powder it no longer feels sticky
this just didn't work for my normal to oily skin
make me even more of a grease ball
i find that this water gel goes good under my foundation
it is really not doing anything for moisture in my skin
it also sat on the skin funny like it didn't melt into the skin as it should
i found it quite sticky
still it didn't absorb into my oily skin
this product on my face was so sticky
it is a little sticky
it is a bit sticky.
i will say that i like that it kept my skin matte for most of the day
know that i'll never find a moisturizer that'll keep the oil at bay for longer than 6hrs
definitely needs to dry before laying down to go to bed especially for those that sleep on your side or stomach
they did not make me glow or do any type of illumination to mu skin
the first time i used it i was oily as usual.
when it dried on my skin it was so darn sticky that i threw the rest of the sample away
now i gotta go wash my rest along with other skincare products that i've put on my face
i found this product to be too watery to be called a gel
however it did leave a very sticky residue that wasn't for me
about time that they made something exclusively for oily skin
i found that it made my skin feel sticky even after applying foundation
that it made it feel like my foundation never dried down
if you don't mind the sticky/wet feeling on your face maybe you would like this?
it did not absorb into my skin at all.
put on my normal moisturizer because i couldn't take the super sticky feeling it left all over my face any longer
my skin still gets very oily throughout the day using this
the texture of this gel is much nicer than others i have tried- it goes on super clean
i hate it when my face feels sticky
the majority of their products irritate my skin like crazy
it made me so oily it felt like i had slathered a layer of olive oil on my face
seriously, i haven't been so oily in my life.
however instead of mattifying my face
this gel makes my skin even more oily than if i didn't have it on
i don't find that this product truly ever sinks into the skin or is absorbed all the way
it goes on so sticky
then it is sticky
i really do not like the overly watery consistency
i wasn't a fan of the applicator because once it gets too low you run the risk of scraping plastic on your face
i usually get more out of other exfoliators
this one scared me by how tough the granulated formula is
maybe if you had more oily skin this would help
sadly my skin also did not really feel clean or exfoliated after using it
this also leaves my skin a little on the dry side
there are tons of other fave masks out there that smell better
it left my face really dryer than it usually is
very easy to wash off
i do not recommend this product to people with dry/sensitive skin
i don't think it applies even therefore made it difficult to remove once it dried
i used cold water after and it seemed to help.
definitely for someone with oily skin.
fume induced coughing it was hardly he at home spa experience
does make my eyes water
i usually follow it up by moisturizing my face because it's a bit dry
it did however make my skin very soft after i got everything off
it comes right off with warm water
this dried so fast while applying that it was difficult to layer in order to make thicker
my eyes did not water even though i do experience watery eyes with other origins peel off masks
it feels good to peel off however doesnt really do much for your skin
if you apply too thin
you have to apply a pretty thick layer to get it to peel off
peel off masks are just too much work for such little pay off
don't see much on the mask if you're into looking at blackheads
you need a very thick layer in order to be able to peel it off
it doesn't smooth over your skin well at all
i couldn't get parts off without scraping with my nails so ultimately i used a cotton pad soaked in facial oil to remove the rest of it
although it does look like liquid gold on my face-pretty
when i apply this mask on my eyes just watered for a long time
tolerable since they did go away as it dried
the only thing i can think of is using it just on my nose as a peel off nose strip
i couldn't even get it to peel.
i just washed it off with warm water.
definitely will not be buying this product however i am going to dig up my copper eyeshadow to use for the fall
was super excited to see they developed a peel off mask
the smell of rubbing alcohol is so strong when applying it's uncomfortable to breathe or open eyes until it goes away
after they dried they were a little finicky to peel off so either give yourself enough time or put on a thick layer to easily peel it off
i still use it because i love peel off masks
clean skin is the main reason i love masks so much
it hurt a lot to peel it off
my skin was drier than before i put it on
leaving my skin shiny as if i had used an oil on my face
i guess it's just like any other sunscreen in which it make your skin a little oiler after
i've cleaned it out thinking a leaf got stuck or something
i think it is a little too drying on my skin
i do think that it was too harsh a cleanser even for my combo skin
i passed it on to someone else with oily skin
then my skin's just drier :
i guess it will work well on really oily skins for teens
give this 3 stars because it doesn't feel like your cleaning your skin
but a little oily for my dry combination skin !
my t zones do get oily after a while !
not even 5 minutes later i have to reapply a different lotion just to get rid of the dryness
if your face is an oil slick year round this clean break is your golden ticket
as far as i can tell it doesn't clog my pores or make me look more oily
it really starts to ball up when i apply my sunscreen or base afterwards
my skin is getting soooo dried out
i also use the face wash which is very gentle.
was so awful i had to rewash my face to get rid of it
i don't like the application process where you have to mix water
i let the product dry
waste a lot of product does make my skin look glowy
there is a sticky feeling after you have pat it on your face
i do believe this is geared more towards oily/combo skin rather than my sort-of dry skin
they seem to cater more towards the oily/acne/combo skin types than my dry
my issue with the product is the sticky-tacky feeling it leaves
bought this product because i have noticed a few dry patches on my skin that i'm not very fond of
i think this is actually for normal to oily skin.
it seemed like every other day i would get a new zit on my face
after maybe like 5 minutes when it dries up
i could feel my skin getting dry again
worse it made me feel like i had a film of soap residue over my entire face even after throroughly rinsing
it doesn't leave a residue which can be a problem with some oils
that in no way can help anyones skin other than as a irritant
age there's no need to put that much fragrance in a product
all it did was dry out my skin!
t's almost like you need to use a lot to feel like you actually lathered up a good amount of moisturizer
although it did leave my skin feeling hydrated it took too long for the stickiness to go away
the product felt sticky on my h
see if it helps with the breakouts until i finish my sample
i did feel like it was a little sticky.
good for hot days when you only wear suncreen or bb cream
i'd say more oily than dry
i didn't care for the way my skin felt after 2 applications
i would describe my skin as oily to very oily in the summer time
this did not give me enough moisture
it made my skin feel sticky after a few hours
this didnt make me oily
it was more liquidy than i would like
this is way too sticky to use as a moisturizer during the day for me
it's so thin i don't feel like i'm getting enough moisture from it at all
i not only got dry skin in some areas
10 minutes later it did not feel like i moisturized at all
i put it on only at night because i have oily skin
my face was still sticky like when i first applied
that ends up being too emollient for me
at first i noticed that it did absolutely nothing for my skin didn't feel moisturized at all
this may work for people who don't have really dry skin
not worth drying out my skin
it leaves my skin so darn sticky
i like things to sink in
maybe my acne is just a little to much for this to control
i got this because i have oily skin
still need moisturizer after i wash my face or for whatever reason my face is even more oily later in the day
did not provide enough moisture
did not help keep my skin shine free
i feel like it made my t zone more oily.
i would need to blot
powder even with my mattifying foundations that i don't normally do that with
i feel that the mattifying part of it made me produce more oils
this product made me even more oily.
all this did was dry my skin out which made my skin produce more oil
does leave weird residue after use
it really dried it out.
if you had oily or combination skin this would probably offer enough moisture
this product would probably work best on someone with extremely oily skin
it seemed to over dry the part of my skin that was already dry
not only did the dry
in the summer time i get pretty oily skin
when it comes to putting it on my face because within a few minutes i feel like i have just moisturized my face with cooking oil
the spf in this product stings if it gets too close to my eye area--i know this is fairly common
worst because it's not silky nor does it stay on your skin when use of makeup on top
in fact, i feel like i look greasier with it on.
but it's not worse than any other moisturizer.
i definitely won't buy it again i have dryer skin
this make my skin dryer than before
my t zone was so oily that i had to begin blotting
i do not have oily skin yet it made my face shinny after a few hours
i feel like this product made me more oily than normal
the problem with this cleanser i feel like its too drying on my skin
it made my skin dry out
each time i use this face cleanser it makes me feel itchy not sure because if my skin was dry afterward or this face wash is not made for me
awful, and drying very costly as well.
i don't like having glitter in my skin care
almost feels drying, actually!
it was just a gloppy mess that took a while to soak in with no "awakening" appearance or sensation
getting this cleanser in your eyes will sting really badly
this cleansing "water" did not feel like water at all
it also felt sticky because it would soak into my cotton pad
be harder to move across my face because it made the cotton pad sticky
it could be off putting to some so definitely wash your h
this is not a dry oil
my face was so oily when i was using it.
all it does is make my face look oily
it dried me out to an uncomfortable level
i would be careful with it if you have very bad acne prone skin
it doesn't feel like a dry oil if it left my face a complete grease ball
lasts much longer than the martian smell too
gross a little bit after i apply it
even in areas i'm not oily in
it certainly didn't worsen my skin
it definitely added to my skin's oil production because by mid day my face would be ridiculously greasy
people complain about the texture.
it'll set up like concrete
then once you get it somewhat evenly applied there are still all these thick pulpy chunks on your face that feel like they're going to fall off
upon using it i found it to be sticky
i will likely finish the jar
you have to dig hard to get a chunk of the product out
i want to love this mask because my skin feels lovely once it is washed off
the slimy chunky pieces of fruit or whatever is in this mask makes it uncomfortable to apply
you also see a lot of the citrus rind in this product which is what holds the majority of the 'good stuff' so that's nice
you put the unnecessarily chunky mess on your face
i say unnecessarily because there is no exfoliation factor
they could've easily blended the chunks in since it wasn't contri
not more so than after i use any other hydrating mask
seeking citric acid at the very bottom i understood more as to why this mask just doesn't do much
t does make your face softer
it has so many hard chunks of fruit that just make application kind of gross
good when you want to slather something really good smelling on your face
i just don't like this mask it makes me feel like put high pulp orange juice on my face
i couldn't get past the sticky texture
applying it grosses me out because it felt like i was applying a jar of jelly
then my skin texture felt ruined — as if my moisture barrier had been completely stripped
isn't the relaxing experience of applying a mask half of why you use it?
the soft bits in the product provide no added benefit it seems as they are not exfoliating or dissolving or anything
do not recommend for someone with dry skin.
it actually did seem to even out my skin color a little bit
i guess if your skin is on the dryer side
this does not irritate or sting like some products with fruit acids do
i didn't find that it moisturizer my skin as well as they made it sound
it didn't irritate my skin though.
what i can't deal with is feeling more oily than moisturized
with not enough moisture
it did a good job of moisturizing around my eyes without being too heavy
this eye cream has no added value unless you want sparkle under your eye
could be nice if you want an extra shimmer over your makeup
the fact that it didn't lend the slightest bit of hydration or moisture to my normal-to-dry under eyes
not in a drying way
so difficult to make an even layer without getting the mask everywhere it's not supposed to go
the tube is just so cumbersome to use when your h
if you peel too soon it's a sticky mess.
you will experience an overall difference in feeling over your face than you do when you peel off the black mask
as with all peel off masks you would need quite a large amount to make it peel
do just one layer
then you'd be using through the tube reallllly quickly
it's pretty hard to get it on evenly you need to use a lot of product as it doesn't spread easily the texture is comparable to thick honey
this one not only was harder to peel off
i mainly tried it out because i love peel masks
also doesn't dry as well
however didn't peel off all at once.
i found it really difficult to peel off even with a heavy application
it was drying as i was applying making it very hard to spread over face
i could not peel it off at all i had to wash it off with warm water
it did make my skin glow right after peeling it off
while i find it pleasant to use
usually good serums when applied you can really feel the difference
didn't care for the glitter either as i applied this at night
i also didn't have any luck with the algenist eye balm so perhaps my skin just rejects this line
it felt like putting chapstick under my eye
this one just needs more moisture
need some hyaluronic acid in here or something.
my face gets oily again
that it "clears your skin up really well"
it didn't do the trick for my dry skin
it dried me out so bad
i got this very dry patch about 3 days in
not enough moisture for me at all
it does an ok job on cleaning my skin
the mask can get quite warm initially
it basically just dries my skin out
this mask literally does nothing to my skin
the night balm also didn't do anything to my skin
the dry patch on my chin hasn't felt this bad since i did a mask with "cinnamon" as an ingredient that my friend got me for my birthday
the only thing i enjoy about this mask is how creamy it feel
i didn't feel any kind of warming sensation after massaging the mask into my skin
as you message it into your skin it quickly turns to a white creamy like texture that's easy to apply
when it turns white it has that slightly warm feeling that's dissipates rather quickly
does leave your skin supper soft
for some it might feel like that is some residue if this the case for you wash face with your cleaners after
believe it or not your skin will still feel soft with out any residual feeling
even though i normally stay away from skincare that heats up
this feels just like honey as you apply it
it gets a little warmer than i’d prefer
that maybe applying a little straight aloe would help calm it down
i’ve used honey on my skin plenty of times
it doesn't heat up or even give me the slightest warm feeling
my skin felt drier after each use
both times my skin felt even dryer afterwords
even though when i washed it off my skin was not red
it does give that "plump" effect
for very dry skin i'll just keep searching
i've never had this much acne in 3 years until i switched to this product after i discontinued using their black mud cleanser for it being too drying
the breaking out may be due to my semi-sensitive skin
it did not clean my skin effectively
it didn't clean out my pores or get my very little makeup off effectively
there is so much air in the tube
it didn't dry me out or leave me flaky like some acne treatments would
it does give you a wet look
it does ok in very small amounts as a spot highlighter
if your skin is dry
this is a nice milky cleanser that doesn't strip your skin or make it feel tight
doesn't leave your skin feeling like it has residue like this one
you're probably going to have use a separate make up remover
it doesn't cleanse as well as it should
didn't realize they had more than one soy cleanser till i started to wash my face
having to add the water to your fingertips was a little inconvenient
did not take off my eye make as easily as other cleansing waters i have used
it definitely doesn't work as a dry oil that absorbs quickly
my skin felt good afterwards however reading the ingredients i realized it was several different types of silicone silica
this mask made my skin 20 times dryer than my "normal dry"
i do not recommend this for dry skin.
when the mask is removed you are left with something that feels like a film on your skin
you skin just feels clogged
leave an oily residue that does absolutely nothing
using rich products occasionally doesn't make it worse
it is really cool to take off your skin
i rubbed it in like instructed however my skin felt dirty
your skin could not breathe when it's on
my skin feels extra dry after unsing it
it left an extremely greasy residue after taking it off
any skin condition can tell you it doesn't feel firming or tightening
however really annoying when you need to keep wrapping it with a tissue to take everything off
if you get the cream on the magnet
for someone who has oily skin i didnt like the feeling it left on my skin
i hate residue on my face, as i have oily skin.
the "minerals" or whatever is left after the mask comes off are just greasy
instructions say to rub in the oil when you're done with the mask
now there's a little bit of the magnetic residue that i can't get off
it did nothing for me except make my skin feel greasey i have dry skin
it feel like you have a silicone primer all over your face
if you need moisture
you are rather "glowy" after
it was weird though because it left an almost watery residue on my face once i removed it
otherwise probably too oily
not worth the hassle, just get a normal mask.
it doesn't seem to tighten the skin
not messy to take off
fyi: i have normal to dry skin
your face is left with some oil
make sure you switch out your tissues a few times
usually want to mask then rinse off and go.
with my oily skin it just didn't work
i feel if you have oily skin maybe get a sample before buying a full size
runny that they either provide enough hydration or stay long enough on my face
yet the consistency of the serum doesn't allow for two drops to cover your whole face--- it dries as soon as it touches your skin
when you touch your face to redistri
this mask is pure fun if you have the cash to spill on plastering moisture rich glue to your face
this product caused my face to become so dry
i did not have any burning/peeling
different diet i have come to the conclusion that when i use this soap over time my skin gets very small white bumps
i don't really like the gel like consistency because it feels like it isn't lathering that well onto my skin
minus another star because it can be drying.
it doesn't lather or even make my face feel clean after i use it
it dried my sensative/dry skin out wayyyy too much
made my face feel dirty afterwards no matter how much rinsing i did
sadly made my skin even more dry
it was not beneficial for my normal-to-dry
which is odd since i have oily skin.
it was until the next week not using the cleanser that my dry patches diminished
unfortunately it made my skin parched
the clear glass bottle did look nice in my shower
if you are super oily
doesn't dry out my skin
i didn't leave the mask on nearly as long as i usually would because of the smell
it may be a problem for someone with dry to very dry skin
nose which generally tend to be quite oily
guess it is more for peeps with skin tending towards oily
on my dryer areas, not so much.
it made my drier areas even drier than before
great on my oily still
i would definitely recommend to an oily skin type
not too much to a dry combination like myself.
if i don't, my skin is very dry the next day.
after an hour or so the dry spots on my skin feel very dry again
it would personally be good for me in the hot humid months
this product is not go for winter weather.
/or if you have oily skin
after applying it my skin still felt like it needed more so until i use this up i just layer it with an additional moisturizer so my skin feels hydrated enough
it just does not moisturize enough by itself
it keeps my face so dry that i never expect for it
i'll use is in warmer weather.
would not recommand if you have dry skin.
this left my skin so dry
i mean six pimples in places that i normally don't break out in
although it did not irritate my skin which was a bonus
not a fan because of the drying feel of this serum
applying my usual rich night cream over it
am left with tightness that's something i try to avoid as someone with dry skin
the only thing i really dislike is how it has a sticky consistency after applying on my face
it makes my skin so dry looking that i only use it as a spot treatment
i can't imagine how much darker it will look with my winter skin
i wasn't aware i should use a brush or sponge
cakey all day that i couldn't wait to get home
super cakey like there was no way i could go out looking like that or add more layer with a foundation to make it worse
i've tried mixing it with other stuff
the more you use the flakier it gets
if this product came in a lighter shade i would love it
it was immediately way too dark on my skin
t doesn't look natural even though they said it works with all skin tones
i couldn't find a way to get foundation on over it without one or both products rubbing off
the shade did not blend at all with my fair skin
i would use this if there was a lighter shade
ard makeup removers due to them needing me to run my skin raw to get anything off completely
it doesn't clean as well or quickly as an oil
she said it was really oily
i figured my mom had tried to use it on its own without rinsing with water
i hate double washing my face
mineral oil tends to break me out so maybe that's what caused my breakouts
felt like i was smothering my face with coconut oil or crisco or something
oily t-zone an the rest of my face is fairly dry
this product makes my skin even more drying
the formula is horrible for someone who has oily skin
you have to wait for it to dry
it did nothing for my pores.
made skin feel nice did nothing for pores at all
aside from that it made me even more oily
then watery again i'm guessing separation in the oil
great primer whether your skin is dry/oily.
it did nothing for my pores
i would just look like an oily mess
so save your money or get something cheaper for your pores
it did nothing for my pores/fine lines
squeezing it to see if i could "mix" the contents
i can't use it alone because it leaves a white film on my face
it also doesn't do so much for my large pores
it would be great if it filled in my larger pores
all i can say is it did moisturized the area
i think it actually made my under eye area more dry
it is super heavy so apply it to undereye area was a struggle
that happens with few heavy / thick creams
i will say i got a very small little plastic jar
i would recommend to people who need more moisture
this cream made my skin look far more crepe-y after several weeks of us
two stars because this product didn't make my skin or eyes burn
the thing that made me really upset is the dryness
dry when i started to use this cream
the longer i used it my under eyes got really dry
the only plus is that it did not irritate my sensitive eyes
it actually totally dried out my skin.
have dark circles in your genes then i don't think this is the right cream for you
wouldn't call it "drying"
makes you go through a jar ($$$) far too quickly.
since that area tends to get really dry
this creme was not for me it had an overall drying effect for me
i won't be using the rest of it because i wake up with puffier eyes
after an hour or so the skin under my eyes feels a bit dry
as if i never put cream on
this product did absolutely nothing except maybe hydrate my under eye area
so far, this eye cream is just so-so.
does give you a greasy eye feel
like one of the other reviews i wake up with dryness
i think if you have dry skin
this was just too much moisture for me
maybe i will try it again in the winter when it's drier
did nothing i wished i used coconut oil on my face instead might saved my skin
like it would be great for my dry skin
don't use too much as it will not soak into the skin well
maybe it my combo to oily skin
it didn't seem to get absorbed by my skin
it does not absorb, even when i mist my face.
even after it continues to be sticky
it is quite sticky
i would only recommend this if you have very dry skin
i do not like products that feel too wet to sleep in
while this product did leave a damp feel to my skin it wasn't too bad
it was almost like my skin got more oily the longer i kept this on
you have to make sure you are washing it off completely at the end of the day
the cream actually made my skin worse
the little bit i used never did absorb into my skin
because i just naturally get oily throughout the day
this is only okay at helping my dryness
the bad news is if you are medium skin or darker this will leave a white coat on your face
moisturize before using this or it's going to stick to the dry patches
after rubbing it into your skin i thought it was enough
my skin has gotten tanner as it didn't make a good replacement from my usual spf
it's also more on the oily side
i found i did get some dry spots while using this product
it really doesn't cut down on my need for other color correcters
i look pretty washed out when i use it
oily mess that it gave me
however i did like how it evens out my skin tone
make sure to exfoliate before you put this on or your pores may look gross
because it doesn't seem to blend into my skin well enough on its own
if i try to use more product it becomes way too chalky
whether i applied a hearty amount of the product or a light layer to my face
unclean because in my experience the product was streaky unless blended out with something other than fingers
it felt so sticky and gross.
it caused my skin to get dry spots.
it made my dry skin worse.
if you apply this over dry or flaky skin
the large jar will last you forever
however for the days i used this i felt like it was a layer on top of my skin that was not breathable
did not stay on evenly
i still like that it has spf
that does the trick for maybe half the day then i'm oily :/ another great feature is the spf in it
this is not good at all for dry skin.
i don't have excessively dry skin
no dry patches or anything like that
i don't have oily skin
makes it look like you have cotton ball residue on your face
it seems to be drying yet it feels so heavy
my face felt clogged as if the skin couldn't breath
make sure you wash your face
not letting it breathe
i only have to wear bb cream on top of it to be satisfactorily covered
it leaves a slightly oily film that i don't personally appreciate because it makes it necessary to double-cleanse
you need a sizeable amount to cover your face to attempt to dissolve your make up
the oil is too thick
because my face is usually so dry
when i use the balms they don't seem to melt into enough of an oil versus when i use liquid oils like their makeup breakup
i feel i have to work at it more to get the product to melt
there is still more of a pulling feeling than with liquid oils
it is so sticky and hard to remove my make up.
faster i can do it at my vanity desk
it felt gross it was sticky
wouldn't wash off with water like it said it would
it did not wash away cleanly
dry patches across my face -- if you have sensitive skin
worst of all i felt that when it dried in my basin it reconstituted to it's thick
it gets some slip when you add water
i find it very difficult to rinse this stuff off.
i feel the need to wash my face twice more to get rid of the residue
like others it didn't feel like my foundation was "melted off" i was pleased that my lip stains would come off
it definitely did not work for waterproof
it also seems to make my eyes feeling kind of blurry if that makes sense when i tried to scrub off my mascara
it did get milky when i added warm water
however i don't feel like it takes my mascara off very well
use a face wash just to make sure my make up was gone
i like to use balm products to take off make up
this one is very hard to turn to milk or oil
i feel you'd have to scrub it off with a muslin cloth to get the product off completely
sometimes youd need to scrub the product off with a towel
i just dont see any milkiness to it when paired with warm water
let your face air dry
i can't stand waiting for my face to air dry.
my skin does not absorb the product
wouldn't waste it i even tried putting it just on my décolletage
even under clothes i can still smell it
putting on a big dollop of this stuff turned my face into an oil slick for the rest of the day
especially during the winter when the air is really dry
bad that it made me nauseated even with a tiny amount of application around the face
it stays on top until you can see the dry cream layer
then rubs off if you touch your face
it still won't absorb
i found this to be very greasy , too.
this product doesn't sink in at all
just added to my already oily/combo skin
more for really dry skin in my opinion
the finish is sticky to the touch which makes it a good primer
this makes me look like i haven't washed my face in a week
stay away from this if you have combination or oily skin
f you are oily like me use only at night
i wouldn't suggest this for oily skin
it didn't feel like my skin ever absorbed it.
i mean like rancid cooking oil
this was by far the greasiest cream i have ever used
it did not absorb into my skin
the smell of it is unbearable it made my stomach turn i don't even know how to describe it
this cream did not absorbe into my skin
it did leave my skin a little oily
does not soak into my skin at all
it's such a thick consistency that other than the oils
did not brighten, soothe, or anything.
i will return this product due to i am a makeup junkie along with good products that help with aging skin especially under my eyes
i also find this a bit on the sticky side.
got rid of the dry patches
i used the jar all winter long.
there was still a whole bunch of makeup left on my toner pad
there's often residual foundation left behind.
on the plus side, it's non-drying.
you need way more than 1-2 pumps to fully clean/cover your face
in that the cleansing oil did technically melt my make up away
even after i tried washing it away with warm water
im sure the that there are better products out there to cleanse skin
it just feels like a cheap watered down lotion
it does not lather
once i started using this oil it made my skin so soft
actually seemed to dry it out
the product is hardened in the bottle unless you run it under warm water or are in a warm place
i felt like i had to rub my face too hard when i was applying it
it did not clog my pores or have any negative effects at all
but i was extremely oily all day.
i would only use this if my skin had its rare dry
i decided to leave this on for the day to see how it moisturized my face
i would sometimes get a whiff of it on my face which i was not fine with
so you really have to rub it in a lot for it to absorb
you get this white sort of film over the skin unless you rub it all in very well
my face is still dry
not the bit greasy
i tend to get dry skin during the winter
my skin would get even more oily when i applied it
it stays tacky on my skin all day long!
my dry skin even sort of feels like it looks oilier throughout the day while wearing this with or without makeup over it
i needed to use a decent amount to get it to spread over my whole face/neck as it's pretty thick
your skin will soak up a lot of product.
however i feel like it dried me out a little bit
i could tell by the texture
it didn't seem to dry my skin out which a lot of bar soaps tend to do
you can get away with most washes
i would first like to say that i have been on the hunt for a cleanser that would treat my oily skin
found that they seem to work best for my oily skin type
while my skin is not getting worse
it was very drying
the bar soap just wasn't the right fit for my skin
i think it's possible that this would work best if you have a water softener
the products smell nice- unfortunately not compatable with my combo/dry skin
i can't get lazy like i can with other cleansing oils
the only issue is the dispensing the face oil can me a little messy
i didn't notice any additional oiliness on my face
a soap bar so that you can first melt off your makeup
you have to be careful when pouring out the oil or else you can pour out too much
i didn't enjoy the cleansing bar because it irritated my eyes
i didn't like how the product felt as i was washing my face
i felt with using the oil first it was just too slippery with applying the soap over it
i don't use bar soaps in general because i hate how sticky
maybe if it came in a tin like the beauty blender solid it would bother me less
the cleansing oil doesn't really do its job
clean without feeling sticky or too dry
then apply this oil
i don't have oily skin
could not get the oil off even after applying the bar soap
i guess the soap bar its not for me:
it's not peeling anymore for dry skin!!
it feels slightly unsanitary to have the bar sitting out as it dries
the bar soap is just messy to have on my counter
it's easy to spill a larger amount than what you need due to the bottle
this was very drying
i liked using the oil then washing it off.
all the natural oils from my face were gone
this is coming from a normal to oily skin girl
it doesn't dry out my face
t can be slightly greasy
i would not recommend using this product on your eyes because it is oily
using the two together really dried out my skin even more
i do enjoy using the cleansing oil on its own
patchy after i used it for 3 days rather than moisturizing it like it claimed
i wish the oil came with some kind of spout or pump it was very difficult for me to pour the oil out onto a cotton round or my h
it holds on to any little hairs or dirt that gets on the actual bar
even if you run it under water its so hard to get the bar actually clean
once i use the soap it dries out my skin so bad i could only use it once
i found it to be a little drying in some areas.
when i used the oil i didn't really see my makeup breaking up like i did with other oils
still can't get any suds to form from the bar
it's a cleansing bar so you don't have to worry about liquids on the plane
see no difference with my skin it's just a bar of soap
it is very hard to remove off the skin when dried down
i can't judge this mask fully quite yet because i just washed it off
maybe because it was too watery
f you get it on your sink rinse it immediately because it dries fast
i must say i find this cream to be very sticky
it does not apply smoothly, sort of thick.
my face felt greasier than before i washed it
especially anything long lasting/waterproof
its hard to want to use this all over your face with that funky smell
it doesn't have much cleaning action
i found the salve to be kind of sticky
it didn't seem to provide moisture so much as make a barrier
making it have that oily/greasy texture that seems to just sit on your skin
doesn't feel like it ever gets absorbed
it's really helped with my dry winter skin!
the moisture mask method has kept me going all week
it was so greasy i had to wipe my h
it has a nice effect just not on certain spots of my face because like i said it clumps up
this product made me look even more oily
this is not meant to be worn alone on dark skin.
like tarte would have a product like this at all
this emphasis my oily t zone was too much
when you go under a light bulb or outdoor light it looks like someone through very fine glitter in your face
because of the amount of glitter that it left on my h
because that amount of glitter cannot be good for your skin
don't slather this all over your face
i've tried tarte's skin care stuff before
it's like back in the 90s when your douse yourself in glitter cause britney spears
if you step out into the sunlight it looks like a glitter bomb went off in your face
applied only to where you want to add shimmer
it's like something you used to put on your skin in middle school after doodling on your h
it was sticky and did not blend well.
it just set on fine lines instead of providing an even color or even absorbing into the skin
when i do that with this balm it ends up getting in my eyes
it made my under-eyes feel more moisturized than if i hadn’t used a product at all
ii was really hoping that this would help rid myself of those deep dark circles i always have under my eyes that take ages to cover with concealer
i did not see any change in my skin tone or tired under eye bags
hours after applying if i were to rub under my eyes i could still feel that it felt oily
beyond what you can get from your face cream unless you're suffering from puffing
not sure if it was because i had no puffy eyes to begin with?
i honestly can't comment whether it works for dark circles or puffiness since i finished up the tube in 3 days
like any other eye cream i use
it made it feel really greasy even when putting a very small amount on
i don't have especially dry skin
the smell of this is somewhere between perm solution
it did seem to fill in lines and plump my skin.
didn't break me out or make my oily face oilier though
i am 53 and have normal/dry skin.
i can feel a film layer on my face
feels sticky then has a nice dry down
this product isn't getting absorbed very well into the skin
leaves something like a film on the skin
was really sticky on my face
i feel like this makes me look oily through the the day
i only use it at night time before bed because it makes my skin look so oily
when i put it on it made my skin look super oily
the last thing i need is something that glowy to just make me more oily
it does not really absorb into the skin
let the moisturizer sit a bit longer before applying the foundation
it is nowhere near as hydrating as the sample was
it’s not because it has an oily finish
for some reason it didn't sink into my skin.
it made my face look really oily
it was way too glowy to wear by itself
definitely a no for someone with texture
as soon as i started using my benefit total moisture again my face was not dry
tried it for my dry skin
my foundation was really drying it out
if i'm having a bad skin day i feel this just totally makes all my imperfections even more obvious
if i have a decent skin day
but i think this was way too hydrating for me.
made me really oily
i've heard pretty good things about milk/micellar waters
i will say that it did calm the flakes
made me so oily
the green tea does a better job of it
i sometimes use sephora's micellar water to cleanse my skin without any real issues
still felt i needed another item to completely get rid of all oils off my face
the charcoal one alone has made me never want to try any of the other cleansers in this line
the only difference i've seen/felt after washing it off was that my skin oils were cleaned away
fool me once, charcoal line
it feels kind of waxy for lack of a better term when rubbing it on my face
it dried my skin out quite a bit
or exfoliating- gave me more dead skin to deal with- even with following up with a moisture mask that usually solves all of my issues
not applying it or the feel of it on my skin
i imagine this would be a good product for someone who has drier skin
t is quite human/my skin was not dry to begin with
as someone with incredibly sensitive skin that turns red if you so much as look at it too hard
it didn't irritate my skin at all
it leaves behind almost a filmy texture when you remove it that i didn't love
there is a long lasting odor in this cream that remained on my skin even after washing
i simply feel that there is an oily film on my face
some face mask  or oil do a better job than this one in terms of hydrating your face without being greasy
i probably will finish this jar by just applying it to me check
when it dried down it felt sticky
doesn't dry fast enough.
doesn't seem to absorb well
normally i would use hangover from too faced which is hydrating
it dries very matte so you dont feel like youre getting hydrating effects although your skin is very smooth to the touch
i wanted so bad to love this because its not greasy or heavy
i went into sephora hoping to find a moisturizer that would help my severely dry skin
said that it would completely fix my dry skin
i find that i still have a few dry patches
hyaluronic acid is not doing anything those things
it doesn't give me moisture
so i have combo skin but more on the oily side.
it didn't even touch the moisture i need
it also did not seem to soak in my skin well
this may work for people with normal skin that just need a little moisture
not for people with dry skin
this mask gave no moisture to my face i actually think it made my skin dryer than it was
s before applying to your face it's seems like a normal cream
when you apply it to your face it feels like water
i don't like this product because it is so fast dry on my skin
it is heavy on dimethicone which is probably why it causes bumps on me
it never felt like it fully absorbed into my skin
this product gave me dry flakes all over my face that was super emabrassing
probably so full of harsh chemicals the skin is too busy fighting that to heal
i will be sticking to coconut oil until i find something more natural
this one feels like it leaves a film on my skin that doesn't quite get absorbed
why hyaluronic acid does nothing for me
as thats where i tend to lean dry
also not good for combination/oily skin tones because it is so thick it made me look v
also it kinda ''sticks'' to your dry patches.
if i had darker skin i would use this as a sheer
i felt this product was not good for someone with oily skin even while using with the pores no more primer
was really excited to try it since i have rather large pores on my nose
it made me so greasy
it hadn't fully dried yet
i find that doing so much rubbing to blend it in defeats the purpose of the stick
i didn't realize my face was that dry
it made my face look like a dirty mess after a few hours
did really well to get rid of any excess oil that i accumulated during the day
it does make your face matte when you first apply
doesn't seem to stay matte for much longer than any other matte primer i have tried
nothing seems to work to keep the oil at bay
keeps you matte for a few hours however:-the packaging is big
however i started getting little zits around the areas where i was using this product
it definitely leaks if it's in your purse.
keeps me matte/less oily for a couple of hours
t already feels like it’s drying up
the only different/nice thing about this is that it can help prevent the "cakey" look later in the day because you're using a liquid to mattify as opposed to adding a layer of powder
my face is a shiny as it usually it at this time
it didn't do much for the appearance of pores
i normally have oily skin
so while i do like the face wash
it does get rid of make up so you don't have that extra step i use my aqua bomb moisturizer with this
so much so that i put coconut oil on throughout the day for an entire week to stifle the flakes on my face
i only recommend this for people with dry skin.
it doesn't seem to absorb into my skin it just kind of sits there on the top
i end up looking like a greasy mess
this just does not absorb into my skin at all
especially if you have oily skin
doesn't feel too slick like sunscreen sometimes does
unfortunately it got greasy quickly on my normal skin
definitely would work better for dry skin or if you're in a dry climate in my opinion
i really like the metal applicator because it definitely does cool
it doesn't completely sink in
i find this eye reviver too dry on my skin
i even used less water
water to make sure that i could move the paste around my face while also maintaining enough grittiness
t would actually scrub
the cocoa bubble things are so hard to break open you have to crush them in the lid or you'll irritate your skin
just on my type of skin
dried it out so much
i tried it in the winter when my skin was a bit drier
i don't know if it's because the dry parts have not exfoliated completely
the bad news is it left my skin dry
i wouldn't recommend it to anyone who has a drier skin type
it took a bit longer than i would like to rinse off
smoother with the exfoliating bar so there is no need for me to spend $80 for this product
applying even a little amount left me super oily.
burning to the point where i had to wash my face asap
normally i don't have any dry patches
also this left my skin sticky after i used it
the only reason i haven't is that it doesn't break out my acne prone skin
all i got was a weird filmy feeling that sometimes would peel like glue off my face
my skin feels oily after wearing this cream for several hours
after knowing that my skin is super dry
it dries down to nothing so not very hydrating imo
while i will say it gave me a somewhat dewy look it was not hydrating at all
once i applied this it started to make my skin flake everywhere
beside that it give no moisture to my skin
this is just a fancy looking face cream/gel that does nothing to my skin
when going on your skin
if i want extra moisture
just as any argan oil would do
not fast to absorb so nighttime use only
i think maybe it absorbs a touch quicker
i would wake up with oily skin
that too is a touch sticky
it just not work on my skin
i feel like this may be better for someone with dry skin
all the people with dry skin saying oily skin types won't like this are just assuming
it felt like a thicker moisturizer perfect for night time which is exactly when i used it
despite the greasiness it hasn't made me break out
it doesn't absorb fast enough to use right before bed
maybe my skin is too oily naturally for this product
granted i have oily skin that just doesn't absorb product as well
anything that touches my face makes it burn horribly
i would wake up with my skin peeling because of how bad this was drying me out
maybe this would be better for dry skin.
it does take a while to sink into the skin as it is a little heavy
right now it isn't as oily as it gets during the summer
be careful because it may clog you
thought maybe it was a little skin purge
one of the things the box says is "not greasy"
just when i'm feeling extra dry
i found this to absorb pretty quickly
it never really did sink into my skin
don't think my skin likes it much because my skin texture got worst on it
it also dried my skin out more
it was somehow drying
did not absorb into my skin at all
it didn't irritate my skin as long as i stay away from my eyes
too runny to get all product on face
especially if you wet your h
wouldn't recommend for dry skin.
it doesn't really foam for me
this makes my skin oilier more quickly for some reason
it would be a better option for people who is combination oily or oily skin
other than than the soapy feeling it has
it didn't clear my skin up at all
i don't think it cleanses well on its own
it so odd though because the first week my skin wasn't oily at all
this formula was a bit drying on my skin
this may not be gentle enough even though its sulfate free
some times i get little dry patches.
left my skin even more dry
this dried out my skin very badly.
it dried out my skin so badly.
i don't recall ever having dry patches like i had after i used this
obviously not worth the dry patches
since my skin is acne prone i thought this "deep clean" wash would work great for me
no matter how much moisturizer i put on my skin was still dry
i wasn't sure if it was the cleanser or my current stress levels
this face wash did not help keep by pores clear or reduce the amount of white heads on face
i definitely prefer the gentle wash.
i guess it may work for some climates/skin type
throughout the day it still feels "tacky" or oily to the touch
and i have as dry a skin you can get.
you have to really rub it in
it feels like you're stretching your skin too much to get it on
i would still try the heavier cream
this didn't work well on my combination/dry skin
using this alone isn't enough for those with very dry or very sensitive skin
although i have oily combo skin i feel as though the original is better
could work as a night cream for my oily skin
a pro to this cream is that when you touch it
as it's intended to be used to clean your face
no better or worse than any of the other pricey washes i've used
it did not seem to moisturize my eyes as they got dry
left it very dry
after a couple days created dry patches under my eyes that would not absorb moisturizer
dryness will increase oil production for us oily-faced ladies
it is a little thick and can be drying.
this product can also be worn under your make to create a smooth canvas for your foundation
i felt like it made my face look dry if the foundation had even a slight matte finish
it dries nearly immediately after you apply it
this would be a better product for oily/combo skin
beware that it does leave a bit of a white cast on the skin
i don't really have oily areas for it to absorb
felt it didn't really absorb well into my dry patches
i can see it being excellent for people with large pores or oily skin
as it did absorb well into my less dry areas
i’m just not sure how i feel about it for my dry skin
i think maybe it will be best for oily skin more so than dry
my skin is very dry, and this did not help.
not sure this is for my dry skin girls out there!
it feels good on skin when you apply
my skin is all dry when i wake up
unless they get rid of the fragrance
i feel like it leaves a layer of something after using it
not enough that i didn't have dry patches
the pump didn't work/bottle wasn't filled properly
however i did notice that my undereyes where a lot more hydrated
a purge if you will on the way to better skin
the flaking didn't get better after 2 more weeks of use
even though it has dried
though i can't say this dried me out
i also noticed that it pills up under my makeup because it doesn't sink into the skin
even a small amount on your face makes it soooo oily
i don't feel this oil is fully permeated into my skin
it dries me out in the places
where i am sometimes oily i am way too dry.
normal to dry everywhere else depending on the day
be careful with it around your eyes if you're sensitive
i feel like i'm forever on the hunt for a good eye cream
it didn't dry my overly dry skin out further
it didn't seem to make a difference in hydration
look at the cotton pad it's completely brown meaning the cleanser it's not cleaning my face correctly
t should be really easy just to remove the dust or whatever from my face
my skin did not feel cleansed at all
i would go through the whole day feeling slimy
won't dry you out
you only need a small amount to build up a nice lather
would recommend it to those with oily skin
they tend to be too drying for my sensitive skin.
just didn't like the way it dried out my skin
this product didn't work for my oily skin.
it doesn't sink in
my skin is pretty oily as you can tell already so maybe it will work if you have skin that isn't as oily as mine
since i have very oily
when i get out of the shower my face is very dry
this "hydrator" does nothing for that
feeling slightly sticky while doing nothing to control the oil on my face
although it's supposed to be an oil control lotion
make my skin so much more oily
i wanted this to be my new moisterizer for my super oily skin
it's almost as if i need two moisturizers for the different parts of my face
i don't get as oily as i used to
a full pump does not sink into my skin
i did not like the fact that if you rubbed too much the moisturizer would ball up on the skin
it for some reason flaked on my skin
it did nothing for my pores or to stop me from getting oily throughout the day
i didn't feel like it controlled the oil
it's just such an intense smell to be rubbing all over your face
must be the tea tree oil in it because my skin typically doesn't do well with it
this can ball up if you rub too much when it dries up
my least favorite part of this product is that my face felt sticky
this product made me more oily
worst part of this product is that it seems to draw the humidity right out of the air
it worked great on the oily parts of my face.
it seemed to cause the dry areas to be a little dryer than they were already
wasn't enough for the dry parts
my skin got dry enough to start peeling.
i feel like when i use it my skin actually ends up more oily than usual within an hour or two
it sometimes balled up a bit with my sunscreen
every once in awhile when you first pump it out it squirts out kind of hard causing it to go on my h
it does give a nice cooling sensation on the face
keep in mind my face is oily all over
it is hard to find products that actually keep my skin matte
for those of us with *very* oily skin
i would only recommend it for those with oily skin
found that i sometimes needed more moisture than this hydrator could provide
didn't necessarily feel like it worked with my skin or really helped with my oiliness
it didn't feel greasy or too thick on the skin
it didn't really hydrating or help mattify my skin too much
it's just not the all day moisture that i look for in a product
it is supposed to help with oily skin???
toner which definitely took away all my oil however the moisturizer added a little something back
for me it wasn't enough moisture for the winter months
i personally did not feel the smell was worth putting up with as my t zone was as oily as ever
has a gel like / oil feeling as well
it doesn't give me the moisture that i need
stating that it was good for oily skin
i tried with oily face and it did that texture.
not sure if it was due to this eye cream
it's really hard to find eye creams without silicon in them
this eye cream does seem to make my undereyes less dry
i actually have to rub some off to relieve the watering
then felt how oily it was
greasy when you put it on
whenever i apply this over anything else including primer or even other moisturizers it just slides around
it goes on in a greasy mess
it does not soak into or lay on your skin nicely.
i tend to have oily skin
this was very drying
it seems to just sit on top of my skin without absorbing
going to work bare-faced because i couldn't get this product to blend
i continued to use the product as i thought my skin was purging all the bad bacteria
i felt like an oil slick in the morning
you see a very full tube
the serum stayed tacky as though it didn't fully absorb
might be better for people with normal to dry skin
i personally found that the serum did not absorb into my skin fully
not great for nighttime for me as i need a heavier cream
particularly their glycolic mask which is the only thing i truly love from this line
i'd rather use something with spf in it
it separates in the tube so you have to shake it up before you use it
because i have oily skin
even though it is a dry oil
now it feels like i'm putting cooking oil on my face
this oil does nothing other than be oily.
it does not absorb into the skin.
it made my skin so oily i couldn't believe it
maybe it's better for people with normal/ dryer skin
i wouldn't recommend it for people that have oily skin
so oily that it will make me break out
i find this too oily for my face
i can't get over the hint of fish oil
not too oily not too dry
i usually don't get dry skin
i only used it at night because it was too oily.
it's just like any other facial oil.
it almost made my lips feel drier than usual after it soaked in
not good with oily or combination skin
it just felt like applying something oily
so basically adding more moisture to my skin.
this product is the worstit's basically like putting olive oil on your face
it made my skin break out terribly
but for my oily skin i didn’t like it at all.
tho they say it doesn't clog your pores it made me break out instantly the night after
it doesn't really absorb fast at all
makes you more oily throughout the day
i tend to have oily skin
or if it would work better in the winter when it gets cold
maybe it will be more useful for those of you who re prone to extremely dry skin?i did really like applying it on my lips especially after exfoliating
for being a 'dry' oil it still made me look extra oily
almost dried too fast cannot feel the moisture i may keep it just to use in prodcuts to bring them to live
as soon as i started using it my dry skin looks horrible
my cheek area depending on the weather or skincare products i use it can be dry
also really dried my skin out
alone it's very drying
this one made me so dry
all it did was make me really dry which in turn made me greasy with flared up dry patches
does nothing for my make up or my dry/normal skin
did nothing for my skin but dried it out.
the skin doesn't take it like an oil
so don't put this on at night like you would a recovery oil cause you'll wake up with a bunch of cat hair on your face
it's slightly sticky when you apply it
not good for your skin
every which way i tried just makes everything melt off my face
i don't even have oily skin
if anything it made my face oily
made my face too sticky to use as a serum.
not in the sticky primer kind of way
s that continue with such ridiculousness will be left in the dust
which means your skin will react when exposed to the sun
that is not my skin i am typically dry
why would something that's good for my skin have dye in it?
for someone like me it is too thin
literally does nothing but make my face more dry.
this product dried my whole face completely
this product not only left me with an ashy skin
might work better with a wash cloth
it did not feel drying
even if they are not waterproof
it made it look oily
except maybe for those with very oily skin
i think it may work better for very oily / oily skin
not greasy at all
not suitable for dry skin at all.
it leaves my face white no matter how much i blend it in
however this stuff is thick
it made me feel like i was applying plaster on my face
it takes way longer for it to sink into your skin
i also wouldn't recommend it for oily or combination skin because after a couple hours my t-zone was super shiny
for some reason i have a hard time finding sunscreens that do not break out my normally clear skin
applying it feels like trying to rub cold cream cheese on my face
i feel like i have to tug at my skin to blend this out
didn't make my skin oily
so sadly i had to throw it away as yet another product that claims to vanish my pores
i find that it does mattify without making my skin tight or too dry
this is a greasy mess that will not absorb.
it does not sink into the skin
it is sticky and does not absorb into the skin.
it doesn't sting or make you feel like your face is overly dry
it makes your skin feel sticky i don't recommend it
when i deep cleaned my pores like i always do every night they showed up again n that white cast just washed off
there's no way in the world that my skin just formed new blackheads in like 8 hours so this is all just fake it doesn't actually pull them out it just covers them up
it didn't dry my skin out
it would be much better in an airless bottle.
don't wake up with dry or flaky skin
doesn't leave oil residue on your
it made my face extra oily
it did nothing for the really dry patches on my face
if you are looking at the moisture surge line
it feels pretty sticky for at least 25 minutes after you apply it
like you have a layer over your skin
it's just a sheet mask where you apple the product first
the mask itself felt really cooling
my skin actually felt more oily than usual just after use
if you get headaches from smells this won't be the mask for you
i would diffidently try out either the moisture lover mask or another mask
this mask left my skin so dry i couldn't even believe it
my skin is never dry because it produces just so much oil
this mask did nothing for my skin.
it really did look like this had the opportunity to highly hydrate dry skin
be careful, as the mask can easily rip.
it was too messy for just having temp soft face as a result
my skin was really dry so a sephora employee recommended this to me
it left my skin so dry it was peeling the next day
i could hardly get it out from packaging without ripping it because i have nails
it really did look like this had the opportunity to highly hydrate dry skin
would not buy again just because i've had better hydrating masks
the hydration that i get from this mask doesn't seem like enough since i have to wear it for 40 minutes
the rubber material of this is so easily damaged by fingers when you try to put it onto your face
i didn't read that it was for combination to oily skin type
do not recommend for dry skin
this simply was not hydrating enough for me.
this would be even worse on oily skin.
keep it healthy on the oily ones
for me it's no more than wiping water on my face
more dry than oily
i felt like it never dried my face looked wet
it does absorb well
definitely beats out the tatcha water cream especially considering the price
if your skin is oily in the least it will sit wrong
just slightly oily in my t-zone
doesn't leave me oily on my forehead which is my oil problem area
it ended up just making my already oily skin even more oily throughout the day
feels too oily all day
it tends to be more dry especially around my nose
as you rub it in it breaks down into a water consistency
it never really absorbed into my skin.
it was kind of sticky,slow to absorb.
this eye cream didn't work for me.
do to it's greasy texture it can rather difficult to sleep in
i feel like i could buy another makeup remover oil or balm that does the same thing for a third of the price
another annoying thing is that it burns so bad around the eyes
it also doesn't feel the best on oily skin.
i honestly feel like you'd have better luck using a micellar water cleanser instead of this
which is nice to rub in
luckily the directions say to put on before your moisturizer
think this product would be wonderful for normal to moderately dry skin
didn't feel like it was doing much in terms of moisturizing my under eye
i would say it even dried the skin out somewhat
at night i use a heavier eye cream on top as this serum did not seem like enough for pm use
i guess you might be okay with these products in cooler climates
this is too drying
this is so drying ... why?
i unfortunately started to get little whiteheads after using it
i also found my face didn't feel too dry after use
i feel like this would be much better suited for oily skin
it keeps leaking a little even though i make sure to close it very tightly
the little bit of lather it has once you start working it into the skin
once it is stripped i tend to break out around my mouth where my skin is the most dry
if you stand the tube up on end, it will leak.
useless to me as a make up remover if i can't use it to take off eye make up
this dried my skin out so much
did leave it feeling a little more dry than normal
thought i'd give this jelly a try
i can get quite oily
then close the tube without making a bit of a mess given how liquid the product is
people with oily skin may like this cleanser a lot more than i did
it much more like just a regular clear liquid soap
which means that you'd have to wipe it clean after each
every use so that when you dispense the next time you are putting the product on a clean surface
although a little dry —which i ignored as it does tend to happen to me with most cleansers
i feel as if i'm doomed to only use the gentlest facial products
dry it does make me break out sometimes in different areas
who doesn't have very oily skin
the bar itself is very hard to clean especially when inside the jar
once you begin use it gets all over the tube
stick to your face even after washing.
i wouldn't use this for using in a make up cleaning routine either
it barely takes any make up off your skin
you could argue you're supposed to use a make up wipe or a cleansing balm beforeh
you're better off spending a bit more on like the fresh cleanser
just because it says "dermatologist tested" doesn't mean that it's non comedogenic
the inner container is actually raised bottom so you get so little product
still enough to peel most
find peel off masks just so fun
which is good as i have oily skin
more like pure fire on my face
the smell is too unpleasant that i had to wash it off immediately before i can see any effect it has
also left me quite dry even on my super oily t-zone
i find this mask to have a very natural earth he sent
when you activate the crystals with water you have to be careful how much pressure you apply
where you apply the pressure because this can irritate the skin due to the aha
it burned so bad i couldn't complete all the steps had to rinse with cold water to calm my face like how it goes on though just not sure yet if i will try again
while this did seem to help my closed comedones
hard about whether i can get over the stench in exchange for the very good exfoliation
i tend to read reviews then take them with a grain of salt
the actual wash seems just fine
even in the summer humidity
it's not easy to open with wet h
not squishy enough to really feel like you can rub on your face
so again imagine a soft bar soap
as others have said on here the jelly ball doesn't really dry out
as a frequent travel i can't take my normal bottle
if it makes it to ten washes
it dries my skin a little bit too much
it never really dries
i wonder if this attracts bacteria by sitting in wetness out in the open all the time
f you are expecting a quick routine cleansing
it doesn't fully dry down had little beads in them well the blue it did
it doesn't completely dry
doesn't really sink into the skin
made my face so oily every time i used it
it left my skin feeling sticky greasy within an hour
this one just didn't work with my naturally skin type
the idea of smearing that on dry skin to sleep with seems unnecessary when you can find masks that are fragrance free
f you have dry or combo dry skin i would skip this product
i've also used it during the day because it behaves well with my oily skin
it doesn't feel any softer or smoother when i take the mask off
gets all in your hair while you sleep
i am pretty sure it was glycolic acid that did me in
not while ruining my skin
did not dry out my skin
however after using for a week it's extremely drying
i think this a bit like the watermelon sleeping mask for me
i do love that this cleanser doesn't leave skin feeling dry
5 or 6 drops is not enough to cover my entire face
it does get absorbed very quickly
it left me pretty oily by morning
it doesn't absorb very well
this serum / oil actually seems to dry my skin out a bit
not sure of any benefit other than maybe over a winter dry patch
whenever philosophy changed their formula to this gooey mess they ruined a great thing
now it makes my skin break out
if you apply on a completely dry face
this doesn't make me break out or get oilier
as it started soaking into my skin it became really sticky
it does absorb quickly making it feel less like a mask
it left my skin feeling sticky which personally didn't bother me
my skin soaks it up literally instantly to the point where it feels just like another average moisturizer
maybe it's just not good for dryer skin.
it has a sticky texture that doesn't go away
it didn't dry or irritate
this mask dried my skin out so bad it felt like s
i used this a lot last summer when my skin was constantly dry
i recommend you to put it into a refrigerator before use
actually a little more dry
i'll probably use it for body cream just to use it up
it totally stops my dry skin in it's tracks!
not gel like either
my issue is that i can't seem to wash it off my face the next morning
i feel like my face is much oilier the next day even after washing it
you can feel it sinking into your skin without drying out
still too goopy even for nighttime
would recommend this only to those with shine problems or oily skin
the next few days it would not hydrate my skin anymore
not too dry or oily
anything i put over it became even more dehydrated
i think if you were very oily or even combination skin
do not recommend for dry skin.
if you don't have sensitive skin that gets aggravated by fragrance or alcohol you'll probably like this more than i did
did not deliver the glow i wanted instead i think the glow this product promises is more like an oily dew not a healthy glow
they'll tend to make your skin feel a little softer or have a soothing element to them
dry stage that many masks do
didn't feel any tingling or burning whatsoever
this mask did not dry out my skin at all
i left it on a bit longer than 20 minutes because it didn't fully dry
you got some dirt on your face
it does tend to be a bit greasy at first
i can feel my eyes area gets dry
maybe this just good for oily skin
possibly a powder to even things out
don't squeeze the bottle too hard to get the product out because the cap can pop off
however it leaves an oily residue on the skin that could be a negative thing to some people
there we no sticky or heavy feeling on my skin.
plan to try it again in the winter when my skin is quite dry
while i was using this not one time did my foundation stick to any dry patches
i didn't notice any difference in my skin except the #clarins #doubleserum did hydrate my skin a lot
it says to continue your regular skin routine afterwards
i felt like toner would have just removed the product
like it never fully absorbed into my skin
this oily product failed me
first let me mention i have oily skin.
i'd definitely would recommend for someone with dry skin 35yrs+
even though it says it's made for all skin types i do not recommend for oily skin
not easy to get the serum out
then it left your skin overly greasy like having thick tanning oil on your face which never dried up
not dry, not oily.
also this product is hard to absorb into my skin
you have normal-oily skin this might be better suited to you
there are many things to like when you first use the fresh jelly lotion
it doesn't dry out your face
not for use on greasy skin
that you apply to dry skin
if you don't use a toner afterwards
i don't reach for it as much as my other serums because the smell is bad
i swear by aha's to keep my skin clear
there have been a few times after applying my facial oil that the pilling was so bad i had to rewash my entire face
because of that i make sure to use only a very thin layer
s get so sticky
you have to re-wash them
it did give a smooth texture when i applied it after shower
causing the oiliness because i would get shiny quicker throughout the morning
i noticed that on warmer days it makes my skin very oily
it felt just as dry as before i didn't have moisturizer on
i found it didn't absorb well into my skin
on a good skin day i didn't have to load up on the moisturizer like i would usually do
on days where my skin is just extra dry i found that i had to use a lot of this cream in order for my face not to feel extremely dry
would not fix dry patches or moisturize my skin very well
i also didn't find that this added any hydration to my dry/combo skin
i do not have dry patches or flakey skin
then my skin was wanting more moisture
you don't have too many skin concerns it'd be a good cleanser for you
if you do not want your skin drying after cleaning do not buy it
it does not balance the oily areas
except for that it dried me out everytime i used it
my nose gets very oily after i use it
it also seems to leave a residue that won't rinse easily
my skin is oilier during the day when i use this
feel like it's missing some kind of crucial cleaning/moisturing agent that my skin must need
however the product is way too drying for my skin
which i don't blame the cleanser it just didn't suit well with my dry sensitive skin
i will continue to use it because it doesn't over dry my skin
feel more like rubbing oil on your face
hard to lather without a lot of water
combo/dry skin people beware- its incredibly drying
i imagine only good for those living in particularly humid conditions
when my makeup is on for 2 hours or more my skin gets suppppper oily
even when it was oily it was too much
i only bought this because the on the go cloths are the perfect balance of clean
this would be great for parched skin.
however i have very dry skin
let me start off by saying i have normal to dry skin mostly normal
the dry skin people know the feeling after you put on a product
wanting/needing more moisture
f you rub your face it starts to roll up
it did preform decently on my combination skin to hydrate without feeling too thick or greasy
it didn't feel any more moisturized than it was before
the drug store one i used before did a better job making my makeup stay moisturized than this did
definetly not a product for those with dry skin.
it does a decent job to moisturize if you have normal/oily skin
it will start pilling if i touch my face even lightly
the moisturizer itself did not have any smell to it
however i did not like the waxy feel it left on my skin
i often had to use overnight masks to fight the flakiness that ensues
it has a weird sticky consistency that i couldn't get past for my oily/combo skin
do not use if you have oily skin!
it wasn't until i tried another moisturizer that i realized it was the ole henrikson one causing me to be even more oily
can not use it during the day since it leaves my face sticky
only use if your skin does not react negatively to dimethicone
definitely not a fix for dry/dull skin
a sephora employees recommend this to me because i have oily
i feel like i'm layering so much on because i can barely feel it
doesn't work well for my dry skin this winter.
if it's for young skin that doesn't need as much moisturizing it should state that somewhere
it dried me out in the spots i didn't need drying
this cream made it so hard to blend out my make-up because of the texture of it on my skin
i find that i have to use a lot more to get rid of the dry spots
'm oily in my t-zone
it feels so dry that i feel like if i have no moisturizer on
do nothing to help dry or flaky skin
unpleasant texture when you apply it to the face
in places where i don't normally get blemishes
the texture is very sticky when you put this serum on
i'll keep using just to see if it'll actually brightens my skin
felt sticky almost the whole time
it has a sticky feeling after you apply which can get annoying if your hair brushes against your face
the fact that it doesn't really dry or sink into the skin
no matter what this serum starts to peel throughout the day as if i had sunburned peeling skin
i would start picking up some kind of flaky things as if my face was peeling
please please plase get rid of this frosted glass bottle that is horrible to the touch
and it is so sticky.
my skin still feels tight from the stickiness for at least a half our after
it really does not make much of a difference for my skin other than clog my pores
it's supposed to be mattifying which is great for oily skin
it leaves your skin extremely oily at the end of the day
my skin would be oily again way too soon
you have to be careful not to apply too much otherwise you'll end up like a grease ball
i wouldn't recommend using it in warm
i think it may just be drying me out since its intent is for blemish prone skin
oily on my combination skin that i found myself wiping the grease off my face multiple times throughout the day-mind you i wouldnt say i have the oiliest skin out there either
it was good for my dry patches
made every where else greasy
only purchase if you have normal to dry skin.
because it gets so oily
definitely do not use if you tend to have oily skin
also it makes me really oily.
at the moment i look as if i had a really bad chemical peel
so now i just put it on my dry areas: nose
i only ever get blemishes 1 time a month depending on weather or if my dog liked my face a lot
have been on the hunt for a moisturizer that does not leave me with dry patches
it was still on the drier side
i didn't have any specific dry patches
unless you have the driest of skin
it didn't soothe it either-
it was so greasy it was impossible to apply foundation over it
it is heavy but not oily looking.
fresh all day without getting the "shine" that oily products can create
it was super waxy way more than i thought it be.
i did blend it between my fingers to warm it up
waxy it is almost like it leaves a film on the skin it never really sinks in it is hydrating though while it is on
after i wash my face my skin is still dry
slightly oily it would most likely melt the makeup right off it is different from other creams usually after creams you are left with a soft feel
started using retin-a so my skin has been extra super dry
i actually had to use oil blotting papers to soak up whatever it is that is not absorbing
the moisturizing wasn't as intensive as i thought it would be either
it takes a lot of warming up in your h
left my skin just as dry as it was.
now i have dry skin patches which i never had before
my face literally feels like a bumpy rubber mat when i wash it now
acne-prone area of your face for a week or so before committing to your whole precious face
it felt like i was caking my skin whenever i use this product
even during the winter when i have very dry skin
the scent of this bothered me so much i had to re wash my face
however it did make my eyes water
my face would be super oily
it was just so watery
doesn't go well with makeup, gets muddy
if you give a sniff in a jar
when you apply on a skin
doesn't react badly with my sometimes sensitive skin
not too oily or greasy.
couldn't get over how much different the texture was
if i apply it anywhere in the center of my face the fumes burn my eyes
my skin does not soak up this product for the life of me
seemed to have dried it out even though it stays looking wet on my face until i wipe off or continue with my makeup routine
otherwise my skin would break out
it smells not unlike a wet dog that's sitting right under your nose
my skin won't absorb it at all.
i feel the cream doesn't go into my skin
something between wet dog and fish.
my skin would just drink it up
it would go on fine then make my skin look super dry
not enough moisture for my 47-year old skin
it feels watery when you apply it to your face
it is mostly dry
it used to dry off my skin, but not anymore.
i can tell that it needs moisture since i live in a very dry climate
does nothing for my skin in terms of delivering moisture
maybe it is way too accustomed to argan oil
i think it would work well for oily skin types
it does not sting or irritate my skin.
for areas that need a little extra moisture
this feels great once you rub it on your skin
having such badly clogged pores doesn't make this product worth it
the wax in this cream formula could be problematic for other skin types
not my fault the product didn't deliver… left a very oily film on my skin
oily t zone so this isn't a good product for those with the same skin type
this dried my skin so bad that it actually chaffed under my lip
it doesn't seem to help with my skin's tightness
it dried me out like crazy
do not wax anything on your face while using this product
your skin will rip off
had to reapply during the day just so skin wouldn't feel so thirsty
rather than sinking in it dries to a kind of film
ice on your face for the same effect
such to disappear cause it won't with this eye gel
a little bit hydrating but not enough for me.
so much air in the bottle
i also do not feel the moisture that it claims to provide
i find it much better than the pots you have to dip your finger into
however it didn't help me much with my puffy eyebags
hoping that i'll love it as much as the toner
when i clean it off my skin feels dry and cakey.
it didn't dry my skin out.
they basically say this is just fullers earth relabeled as "umbrian clay
i don't think this jar type mask cannot stay fresh for one year because this is a matifying mask
i will use this jar up
i can only use it once a week though because it's very drying
it can be a bit messy if using outside of the shower
i think it would be great for someone with normal/dry skin not sensitive
this takes forever to soak in making it suitable as a night cream
eventually my super dry skin just got to be too much for it
which always hydrated my skin even though i don't need anti-aging at this time in my life
but after using this product, my skin gets worse!
it is more like sticky feeling
maybe it would have been better in mid winter under drier weather conditions
probably would be good with someone who has drier more mature skin
my dry areas are still dry
they seem way too rich and thick.
it totally dried out my skin
like i'm just putting water
no amount of moisturizer or even oil would keep my skin from feeling dry the next morning
it goes on your skin
it doesn't take off my mascara or eye make-up like i would want a cleaner too
doesn't dry your face
but now find this to be too drying.
even though it left a residue
with the winter wind i've been dry
i always felt greasy after using it.
oily all the time
the worst thing is after you use it to wash the face
it doesn't clean the oil off my face
while i'm sure this is awesome for people with drier skin
am oily everywhere else
this was one of those cleansers that felt like it did absolutely nothing to my skin as far as cleaning it
it didn't feel like it cleaned or penetrated my skin at all
i would avoid this unless you have completely parched skin
doesn't aggravate my sensitive skin in the least
rinsing i can feel a film on my skin which i so not like
or keep it in my shower
the bottle even states that it doesn't need to be rinsed off
when i usually just need a simple facewash to take my little bit of makeup off
i felt like i couldn't get it clean from the cleanser itself
it also drys up so the milk is still on your skin
this cleanser does in fact leave a yucky film on your face
if you need moisture
it makes your face feel like you have oil all over it
in the end i was still left with some residue on my eyes that wouldn't wash away
there is still so much makeup showing up on the cotton pad that i feel the need to wash my face with a real cleanser
it felt like i was trying to wash oil off of my face when using this product
it does not wash away with water like the old one did
i'd hate to stop using this cleanser now because it was the only thing that didn't dry out my already dry skin
dont like at all sticky
it feels like it is still on my face after rinsing it off several times
even using a cotton ball does not do it
it feels like it does not come off your face when you rinse
doesn't feel like it even washes off in water
leaving an oily layer that feels neither clean nor smooth
it is too gentle to wash off anything.
i find my face is very slick
almost oily after using it
i always thought the definition of "cleanser" was something you could count on to remove dirt
maybe its because my skin is oily or because i wear make up
it felt exactly the same as if i'd washed my face with your garden variety
rinse it off because i've found using it less doesn't do the job
sensitive skin or even dry skin then this would be a nice cleanser for you
use this one in the morning to help with my dryness
ever it makes feel like using glue on your skin
this dried out my skin terribly
doesn't dry my face out
it really dried out my skin
it started to be very drying
it didn't irritate or dry out my skin at all which was great
however i don't feel like it was strong enough to dry out fresh pimples
it was like putting goop on my face that didn't make any difference
so you have to turn the dial often to get product out
you have to rub it across your blemishes
i think i picked this up to give my skin a break from the salicylic acid in the origins spot treatment
doesn't leave much of a residue
didn't dry them out
just seems like it was a poorly made applicator
this treatment gel does not work on me at all.
while it didn't make my blemishes worse
on the plus side it didn't irritate my skin or sting
pros: very light and does not dry out skin.
moisture it just made them greasy
another star because it does not burn if you accidentally get it too close to your eyeball
more often i found i couldn't get the product out of the container
t looks like you put grease all around your eyes
the consistency makes it feel like it's not really absorbing into your skin
i don't really think it does much aside from moisturizing the skin under your eyes
this hot feeling cannot be good for the skin
it sinks in quickly and is good for day wear.
i didn't like simply because it made my skin super oily
it was too rich for my skin in the day.
i would suggest only for dry to combo skin
i felt like it didn't sink into my skin
because my skin starts to look dry
i didn't notice more moisture or glow than my usual routine :
ended up being too greasy for my combination skin
unfortunately it wasn't good on my oily skin
even after putting on makeup it made me feel greasier
does not cause my skin to break out
it does keep my skin from drying out
i think it may have even dried my skin out
doesn't leave you looking shiny or greasy
this never seems to fullyabsorb into my skin
as i have dry skin
i actually felt it drying my skin out while it sat on the surface of my skin
instead i found it made my skin really oily
i feel like this is more for people with oily to normal skin
certainly not for the harsh winter weather
while it works okay it's not better than a facial soap i normally use
have oily skin this would work for you
this might be good for someone with oily skin
i think it's the extra moisture in this face wash
switched cleansers for a month thinking maybe it was just the weird weather
this formula doesn't even feel the same in texture
nor dry or oily
this gave me dry patches all over
i would only recommend this if you have very oily skin
it doesn't clean your face at all
forehead feel so tight after a shower that i had to use twice the amount of argan oil afterwards to balance out
couldn't believe that this cleanser actually dried my skin out
it dries my face to heck.
this wasn't my ride or die cleanser because honestly it made my face feel more dirty than it aready was
i do use micellar water to take it off though
i also find it a bit drying
it doesn't burn or otherwise cause damage to the sensitive skin there
if i use this product in the shower
this dries out my skin too much after using it.
doesn't cleanse at all, breaks my skin out.
this product doesn't clean my face at all.
i prefer fragrance free skin care because then i know i'm not getting any extra harsh chemicals on my face
my nose especially gets oily throughout the day
this cleanser for some reason really dried out my nose
i will say it is the 2nd face wash that doesnt burn my eyes
i've had drug store cleaners that don't make my face feel this terrible
t's not like it had to take off layers of foundation
ful of times my skin has become dry afterwards
i would use it in the shower to clean my face
it is indeed drying
the gel is very hard to get completely off your face when rinsing
does not feel greasy.
bring very oily -- which
the pump bottle doesn't have a tube attached to it so there is absolutely no way to get the product out
my pores do seem to be a bit smaller
it made my face shiny and even more oily looking.
unless you have a severe pore
i felt like my skin couldn't breathe when i used it whether under makeup or not
didn't work all that well for my oily skin
it does cause some peeling around my nose if i use it there twice a day
the only thing it did was make my skin excessively dry
i also dislike packaging where you have to dip your fingers in to get the product
not a pump container anymore
it was supposed to cool down my skin
couldn't continue using it with how bad it made my makeup look with all the flaking
it looks like if you have some redness around your nose you need correcting this is the product for you -_-
it doesn't leave me oily
i feel like i need a bit more moisture in my face bc i dry out in some spots
getting myself some makeup now that my skin is back to normal
treated before wasting your money on what this ended up being was an expensive moisturizer
a sephora associate told me that it is only meant to be hydrating for dry skin which might appear red
the cream is too rich, i need something lighter.
this has really helped bring the moisture back to my already moisture-lacking skin
it is the perfect amount of moisture for my skin in the winter time
since the cream is pricey i do nit think i will reorder once i use the rest of this container
actually made my oiliness worse after 3 days of continues use
my face just got oilier
since you do not have to stick your finger in the jar
it does not seem to firm skin or "hydrate" either
it doesn't sting or irritate in any way.
even tried storing it in the fridge with little to no results
make sure not to get the product too close to the rim of your eyes or it will smart
i used it sparingly, but i won't push my luck.
it uses a lot of water to get the clay to the face
you can put it on in the shower
even when i keep the bar in a dry environment
imagine washing your face with a brick--it's just as easy
wait for it dry
oil stays on :/ i don't reccomend this for combination skin
makes the sink area all messy
you either have to rub the bar on your face while wet
it'sa solid brick of clay which when wet can be smeared on the face in a fairly light layer
smearing it ona blemish or any small place that could use a deep cleansing
i just don't think the coverage of clay on my face is effective
i leave it in a soap dish with drainage so that it stays dry
it still is just a big clay mess all over my tub
however it looks like this could be a great product for someone with oily skin
even though sometimes it can get messy by the sink
i feel like it starts to dry out my skin within 3 days of continuous use
people with oilier skin might have better luck with this bar
it felt like it was soaking up all the oil
don't leave it in the shower
it also comes in a container unlike this bar which can get pretty messy
my only issue is it breaks apart sometimes when it's wet
add too much water
doesn't form a "mask" as it should too little water
in the shower for 5 minutes or more until it dries before you can rinse it
you feel like you're scraping your skin with a rock
hardly any clay comes off
it just doesn't feel like i'm cleaning or removing anything on my skin:/
plus it doesn't feel like it cleans well so a lot of the time i end up washing my face twice
it does not feel like it washes my face well
perhaps it is the soy mixture or something
or it would be if it didn't force me to use an exfoliator or scrub the heck out of my face
i feel like i'm breaking out when my skin is usually clear
i guess it cleans my face adequately
this is definitely extra gentle as it says it doesn't even burn my eyes
it is so gentle that it doesn't "instantly" remove my makeup like it claims to do
the product is so gentle i didn't feel like it complety clean my facee
nothing made the stain go away
it also has a really cooling effect that was so extreme i considered washing it off right then
unless you've got oilier skin
that means that applied on greasy skin
it makes it less oily
if applied by mistake on normal or dry skin
it feel like my face is on fire and it itches.
the clay become watery very quickly so don't use it in the shower or else you'll end up wasting most of the tube
it did seem to reduce the amount of oil on my forehead
takes a long time to dry
this product doesn't have any coconut in it
i got it primarily because of the winter dryness i tend to get
i feel it does not help remove excess oil
the only positive quality if the cleanser is that it is not drying at all on my skin
my combination skin became oily part way through the day wearing it
i wouldn't promote it as a cleanser because it doesn't feel like it really cleans
that didn't stay long with the heat outside
it doesn't give you a smooth surface to work with
i still feel sticky 30 min later
i also hate trying to get it out of the container because it gets all under your fingernail
since i have such oily skin
i wouldn't recommend this to people with oily skin
after you apply it to your face try washing it off your h
it's difficult to apply it onto the skin
just very sticky afterwards.
unfortunately i do already have oily skin
when i get out of the shower my skin does get dry
i try a lot of new things for oily skin
seriously not for oily skin
too expensive for little you get yet so sticky
not a very nice product if you have dry skin
i could still see the glow come through despite the fact that my routine general goes: moisturizer
it left me rather oily a lot sooner in the day
after reading the reviews i thought this may help tame the oily portions of my face
i find it to be overall very drying on my skin
the only way i can get this to work for me is if i do a pretty tedious exfoliation routine prior to application
this made me dry out so bad to the point were my skin was peeling
i believe my skin did not react well with the matte substance of the product
if you suffer with dry skin i would stay away from this product
oily on the skin although i know its water based
almost like a lip balm that it is hard to get out of the container
once its is out it does kind of melt onto the face
then sort of like a wax it just sits there on top of my face instead of absorbing in
this was the worst moisturizer i have ever used in the sense that it made me such a greaseball
if you already have oily skin or actually want a matte moisturizer please save yourself the trouble
it made my skin much more oily after only a few hours of wearing it
it did nothing for me in keeping my oily areas matte compared to various other moisturizers i've used recently which promised no matteifying effect
even in the dry of winter
would work great for normal/dry skin
actually made me quite oily in my t-zone within 3 hours
i used it at night on these dry patches i got on my cheeks from the winter
this really didn't work for my super oily skin.
i feel like i have a layer that i can just scrape off my face
it could be good maybe for people with less oily skin or skin that is more easily penetrated by the thick balm consistency
did keep my face matte for like 2 hours
my face got so dry
which i usually get dry around my nose
i did not love the serum because it didn't seem to absorb into my skin
the serum dried kind of quickly if i didn't rub it in immediately
it does get absorbed quickly in to my skin
i finished the bottle because it did get absorbed well in to my skin which generally doesn't take moisturizer so well
it didn't help dry areas
it doesn't soak in well
it sort of stays a little sticky
can get very oily as a result
because it makes my eyes so dry
they aren't normally dry
this product made my fine lines worse by drying out my skin so much
i find it to be very drying--
you will be much better off sitting up in bed with an ice-cold washcloth over your eye area
this product is fantasic for reducing puffiness if i didn't get enough sleep the night before
although the gel felt cool when i applied it
especially if you keep it in the refrigerator
did nothing except provide some moisture
there is supposed to be some kind of "miracle" plant extract in this eye cream
it just didn't sink into my combination skin
seemed even stickier than when i put it on
i felt like i had put acid on my skin.
as i am still just as dry
immediately remember why i love the extra firming eye cream instead
if feels pretty sticky
which it can do if you have some dead skin cells hanging there
it pills if you try to use it as a base under make-up if you have dry skin
while so the skin doesn't get used to it
it is somehow too oily for me.
all i got from this product was a sticky
you don't rub this in just pat on a layer!
but this did not work on my (dry) skin.
perhaps it is for people with oily skin?
there is not point because applying makeup on top of this is a nightmare: it dries very quickly
definitely would not recommend it to people with oily skin
i don't like a lot of added fragrance in my face care though
forget using it before your makeup unless your skin is totally parched
i like just rubbing it on and go.
the last thing you want after an already overly dry flight is to feel tight
since my skin is prone to being on the oily side i don't think this product helps
i felt like it didn't help much for oily skin .
it also dries me out pretty badly if i use it every day
it burned so bad i had to immediately rinse it off
need that emollient type of product right away or feel i'll crack
i think a good thorough cleanse with something less "chemical-y" would work just as well
i can only use it once a week because it dries my skin out
with it becoming very oily in the summer
very dry in the winter
if it gets in your eyes
which is bound to happen if you wash your forehead
it also burns super super bad if you get it in your eyes
super dry everywhere else
this seemed to do a great job of taking care of the slick without making me feel dried out
if used every day it dries my face out
however, it dried my skin out too much.
this cleanser was just way too harsh for me.
i limited it to my oily areas
it was way too drying for my skin
it burns if it gets in your eyes too.
it gets rid of all make-up
it also doesn't really foam up.
it just made me feel greasy all day.
my face is already oily
it was too drying
actually felt more greasy after putting this on
this is a very pricey product that so far has not show any results-also dries your skin a lot
f your skin is on the dry side
rather bad when paired with my oily t-zone
as i have some issues with drying when the winds come up
went back to only the ddf ultra-lite moisture again
this is not a a good cream if you have very oily skin unless you like the full-on shine look
it does have a mattifying effect on your skin
the sephorqa staff recommended it to me because i had oily skin
don't waste your money on this product along with the rest of pore no more line
worse my t-zone now easily oily up.
it was too greasy to wear during the day for my oily skin
it actually made my face greasy instead of mattifying it
worse by using this cream on my already very oily skin
the only good thing about this product is that it did calm down the redness
it made my skin even oilier than it was before
the gel does feel nice going onto the skin
anything would be cooling if you put it in the freezer
i get overheated very easily
thought this would be a nice cooling lotion that wouldn't feel too thick or hot on my skin
i did not realize it was more of an after sun treatment rather than an every day moisturizer
you could store it/tote it under rough conditions
what my skin wanted on hot days it was a treat
a tip: it feels especially cooling if you keep it in the fridge
have to say that i didn't like the strong "cooling" sensation that felt more like burning
instead it made my face super dry
it doesn't seem to provide any moisture to my skin
my skin would still feel dry because it never absorbed
it ended up being just a bit too rich for my skin
if you get any near your lips be prepared for a disgusting taste
it seems like it didn't fully sink into my skin
this did the trick however felt thick
oily on my skin as if it did not absorb
still searching for that cream that will help his dry/cracking skin
in fact it seems rather drying
that may be the cause of the dry patches in the morning
i also found it leaving a waxy film on my face that bothered me all day
i think it was sticky.
every time i used this it made my skin greasy
this just made it super oily
used just a minimal amount thinking the oiliness was a result of using too much product
it just felt so greasy ad like it didn't sink into my skin at all
i think the main problem with this is it doesn't absorb into the skin
this works for me as my skin is on the drier side
with that being said i don't see this working for ladies with oilier skin
this literally looks like you just applied straight grease to your face instantly
there was no moisture.
sun screen you buy on the beach from the tiki bar when you realize you're turning into a lobster
wash this stuff off
was told as long as i used a water based moisturizer underneath it would be fine
because i love their face wash
did not cause me greasy skin
my skin gets super oily during the day
i live in a mountain desert climate where there is no humidity
i've learned after a while that skin that behaves like dry skin isn't always dry per se in terms of skin type
never seems to absorb even when my skin is parched or thirsty
but will leave u shiny and greasy.
unfortunately this cream made me greasy
even though my skin is dry
i wouldn't use it if you have oily skin
but it will be greasy.
not good for people with oily skin
the cream just does not absorb into the skin
i wouldn't necessarily describe my skin as dry
revisit it once the weather turns warmer
but doesn't really work for dry skin.
it did not absorb into my skin at all
i think this would be a wonderful product if you have normal to dry skin
this did not irritate my skin in the least.
by lunch i had to wash my face to get rid of the smell
i really wanted to wash it off because it felt like i had a mask of oil on my face
i think this would work really well for dry skin.
this isn't a good product if you have oily or combination or wear makeup
it becomes very greasy over several hours if applied to oil skin
however it worked well for my boyfriend because he has very dry skin
my face gets greasy as the day goes on
it also takes a while to absorb in to my face before i can put powder foundation on
i found it to be drying
it was difficult to wash off
left it very oily
it also never left my skin that smooth either
doesn't dry you out
i feel i could get this from a somewhat cheaper cleanser
as rich as this cream feels it didn't prevent me from getting the dry patch that i tend to develop along my left smile line when it starts getting cold
keep in mind i have combination oily skin not dry
'm ok with the trade off of less make up for more moisture
i needed some extra moisture in my under eye area
my under eye area still needs extra moisture
seems like it never dries
it will add some moisture (not a lot).
it would be suitable for someone in early twenties in a more humid climate
it doesn't make your eyes sting.
actually was a little drying to me
it did not add moisture
sad because it advertises as a cream you can use on upper lids
i don't discourage others from trying it because eye creams are just so tricky
i prefer that consistency to the more watery ones out there
it did not add any moisture to the skin as i had expected
this one does not cut the mustard
if scrubs hurt your skin this will be good for you
this burns quite badly the entire time it is on my face
i like this in the summer because it cools me down
otherwise this will make your skin feel worse
in my opinion it's just not a good product for anyone with dry skin
after a bad chemical burn a few years ago anything that burns or stings severely i remove immediately
however, my skin got really dry after the mask.
was too hard to wash off
when i wash it off my skin is very red
for this price i really think you would be better off getting some clear aloe vera
i still felt tight and dry after using it.
i actually feel dry
my normally clear skin developed some break-outs
the heavy artillery in this cream might be too overwhelming for you
even when i try to warm it up on my fingertip it pulls at my skin when i try to apply it
i like it because it does feel hydrating when you first apply
it didn't seem as hydrating or firming as it once had
silky as i thought it would be nor absorbing
makes my eyes water every time i put it on
did not help with dry skin.
it would be a good eye cream for me
dry/somewhat oily in warm weather
i tried this product in very cold weather
unfortunately this product hardly absorbed into my skin
it's much too mature for me to use a lotion -- i've only used creams for years which may be why it's in such good shape :
it's difficult to get out of the jar as a result
then on your face it feels sticky
rather "evaporates" into whatever else other than my skin
product made my face extra oily
it wouldn't absorb all the way into my skin
it would get on my pillow
it feels too thick when applied to my face
it does not feel like the moisturizer sinks into my skin
my skin simply doesn't absorb it
however i found that it just wasn't quite hydrating enough
saying show she has dry skin also
i actually found it kind of drying
i usually get really oily
my face does appear oily
sometimes because of the oil
with a tendency to dry out during colder weather
reminded me a bit of sunscreen in the way that i really had to rub it in to make it penetrate
halfway through the day my skin was way drier than it should have been
seemed to be making it drier
my skin has felt better at the end of a long day where i forgot to moisturize
not sure if this is meant for more combination/oily skin types
it definitely did no favors for my normal/dry skin
i still have some dry patches on my face that don't seem to soak up the moisture
it just does not absorb into the skin
as an eye cream i find it okay
when i first apply it the lines seem to soften
i still have a hard time with the sticky texture
it is like glue which makes me tug at my skin to apply
it feels super sticky and hard to apply.
sticky and it did nothing
t doesn't easily apply onto your skin
it kind of gets stuck on my skin
made them water quite a bit when applied under my eyes
i don't find that it absorbs very quickly
i don't have dry skin
i found it not easy to absorb.
when you wash your face
i found this to be way too heavy on my skin
goes on nice, not sticky or greasy at all.
it was kind of sticky
this cream was way too heavy for me
even if you barely put any on it feels like a layer of lard is on your face
keeps your skin from getting dry
but leaves my skin very dry after using it.
when i was washing my face my eyes were burning really bad
also left my skin extremely dry after each use
would recommend this to someone with oily skin that doesn't have to worry about acne
wash my face more frequently
i wont buy the oily skin one again
i really like the extra mild soap it's a little drying in the begining
i don't really trust this soap being that it left so much residue in my shower
i actually found this to be drying
first it made my skin chronically dry which then my skin became oilier to compensate for the lost oil
by lunch if i wipe my nose i can see
i spot tested this moisturizer on my face to see if i would break out from it
maybe because i have really oily olive skin is why
i wouldn't recommend this for oily skin
didn't absorb super well
as it is not sticky or greasy
i like the cool feeling when you put this on.
the product will definetly firm your eye area while drying you skin out in the process
if you need some pretty oily eyes not to dry out
be careful of getting it too close to your eyes bc when it actually gets in your eye
i find this one a bit drying
if you do have sensitive or dry skin
i feel that it didn't help lessen the problem of oily skin
when i rinse it feels like there is a film on my face
only during times skin is super dirty
the rinse off was extremely disappointing.
it also gave me a zit which i guess was from not cleansing my face well enough
i even use it to get my foundation brush squeaky clean too
making your skin feel like it will split
it just smells like plain soap going on your face
didn't like it because she has very dry skin
i can say this is very drying
after just one use it left my skin dry
it also stings very badly if you get it in your eyes
this stuff burn my eyes.
would not recommend for dry skin.
might not be good for sensitive skin wiping it so many times can cause the face to be red
i only gave this 3 stars because it takes too long to wash off…anything more than 2 splashes of water is too long for me
removing make-up however it also dried out my skin terribly
my skin would feel so parched after using this.
i would suggest this for more oily skin types.
when i apply the product it feels like i just applied water
never really absorbs because of how much silicone is in it
i guess if you have really good luck with heavy silicone products
does not feel heavy or oily under the eye
i didn't like the consistency very much because it felt sticky
i think you could easily get a better eye cream that does more than just moisturize them for less
i can only wear this at night because i find it is too greasy
i wanted more moisture because i generally only use eye cream at night
like it to feel heavier
not sure if it is thick enough moisture for winter time
i much prefer tubes or containers that you don't have to stick your fingers into
otherwise is not greasy
so just not good for combo to dry
it never really got absorbed even on my dryer cheek areas
that maybe this would work for someone with extremely oily skin
this is definitely not a product that can be used for combination skin if the non-oily part of your face is normal or dry
summer time means extreme heat
the end of winter left my skin very dry
it doesn't add any extra moisture or sink in
this gel is not so great for oily skin people like myself
my skin is only actually visibly dry when i put on foundation
didnt make my t-zone look dry
my skin is finally starting to not look dry
the only way i could get it to moisturize my face at all was if i smothered my face with it
i think i dried out my skin so much with all this acne products that i need some serious hydration here
this stuff did not hydrate my face enough
i plan on saving this for the summer when my skin tends to be greasier
if your skin is even slightly dry in the winter
it doesn't seem to absorb into the skin like the lotion does
it did not dry out my dry areas.
it left sort of film/residue on my skin that i feel coming off while washing my face at night
i take relatively hot showers
my skin is actually drier after i put this on.
although the matte finish may be nice for people with oily skin
my face type is oily
as soon as it dried my skin felt so dry
it is great on my oily t-zone
it's a gel like consistency that goes on easily.
after rinsing my face it felt like the whatever moisture it provided was gone
this made is so hard to wash off my face.
then got even more oily after i used it
am generally pretty clear except for occasional hormonal break outs
this was great on my dry areas
it also left my t-zone super oily for about 3 days
this would be lovely on those with dry skin
it slightly softens the skin i think you could find a drug store equivalent
they seem to make me greasy.
doesn't irritate where i'm oily
it's just a nice mask if your skin is dry.
it didn't make my skin oily afterwards
everytime i apply it after showers or cleansing my face
if you are prone oiliness of any kind this is not for you
could be good for someone with very dry skin
it left my face oily even with minimal application
my face was very oily all day even when using a small amount
it never seemed to dry
would be great for super dry skin
it's just too much moisture for my combo skin
i normally have clear skin
definitely not greasy in the bit
i got no sun protection from this
if you're planning on swimming it burns your eyes
i remember it making my skin so soft that i had to purchase it right away
in fact my skin is perfect other than being dry
maybe the product would be better for people with oily skin
used to love how light it was on my skin.
my face can get oily
i started getting more oily than ever
didn't leave my skin as soft as the night cream
this product would make my skin sting
i find that this stuff still cannot get off leftover lash glue
i honestly feel that my knock off makeup eraser towel is better than this
u have normal to oily skin then this is a good product
when you used it to get off your eye make up mascara
eyeliner it leaves your vision blurry for a good 10 minutes after using the product which i won't be using anymore
i washed my face normally after using
it simply redeposits it under my eyes
is difficult to wash off at all
it turns into a clear oily texture once you start rubbing it into your skin rather than the milky texture they claim on the description
the balm didn't take much off at all
it hardly took off my mascara that is not even water proof
i only wear waterproof eye make up so this was able to take it all off
there tends to be bb cream left on my face after washing the product off
i liked that it wasn't oily that it absorbed quickly into my skin
don't like that sometimes some of the eye cream that stays in the pump tip dries out
makes them water like crazy
i don't mean a gentle burn
you have to throw away small amount of it because it dries out
maybe the products tend to dry out fast.
if i sweat or cry
each night it makes my eyes burn really bad
everytime i put this on it burns my eyes
makes them water to the point that i can barely open my eyes
my eyes would burn like crazy
i couldn't wait to get to the restaurant to wash this off
or outside sweating or even in the airconditioning inside
don't buy this if your eyes are the least bit sensitive or you'll be crying all day long with red eyes
even with using just a little the cream made my eyes burn
your eye area never seems to get tan or burned
it does burn if it gets in your eyes
i don't recommend this for teens or people with dry
it's really hard to clean excess oil
that's a big plus for me over so many other cleansers
even though it did make some foams.
and i got some acnes after i used for a while.
i can use it in the shower
my face was so dry
i can get away with cleaning my face with this with just one pump
this product doesn't clean out well all my oil
it left my skin dry after used it
would spout out straight liquid the next time i would try to use it
i found it to be a bit drying if used daily
however this is a terrible face wash mainly because it was so drying on my combo skin
there are better face washes out there that clean
don't strip your face dry at the same time
it still would not lather at all
unless you have overly oily skin i wouldn't recommend
the foam seems to disappear when you're working it into your skin
just to drying for me
for my dry skin this is too drying.
this soap did nothing except for smear it all over my face
it's like applying an oil all over your face
you have to use bar soap to get rid of the film it leaves
it was so drying for me
while the toner was definitely bad for me
if you're more on the dry side with your combo skin
does not penetrate enough for a deep clean.
which i personally don't like in a face wash
it's also very drying.
clinique's take the day off balm is amazing though
this face wash became a little too drying for me
this dries my skin out so badly that i have most of the bottle unused
it didn't leave my skin parched
i either massage it into my skin for 1 minute or use my clarisonic
fresh without drying out too much
just okay face wash
fortunately i'm stopping the use now so the acne won't get as bad
i find even the mild formula too drying
as if i didn't wash off all the soap off
it does clean well without over drying my skin
my skin type is combo with it being a little more greasy in the summer time
for me it left my skin stripped down of every last bit of moisture
it does a decent job of cleaning the face
as i had read some of the other reviews that the one for oily skin is fairly drying
the clinique overnight moisture mask to return my skin to how it was previously
no wonder my skin was so dry
sticky if you do not wash properly
first i did my usual routine {raw sauce
it doesn't matter how long i wait after i moisturize
in any other situation i recommend that people with brown skin should try this on at the store before buying it to determine if the shade works with your particular shade of brown
not bad as a primer - my skin was not a fan.
i do like the feel of this primer on my skin
i didn't feel like it lasted very long or made a difference with my makeup or pores
my skin never got that oily before
you can not use this instead of foundation unless you are a literal porcelain doll
i feel like this doesn't make it oily or dry
after the first time i used this product it does make my pores looks small a little bit
if it didn't seem to clog my pores in hiding them i would love it
oily as soon as i put it on my face
it didn't minimize the look of my pores like the description said
everything was runny at the end of the day
i wound up liking another *much* less expensive product much more
as we apply it it martinis the skin instantly i really like the look of that
skin gets oily after few hours just as without primer
if i shook the tube before each use it wouldn't be as runny
the sales lady sold me on this when she said it will make your pores disappear
it did nothing for the oily areas of my face
does not keep my skin matte throughout the day :(
i found that didn't affect the color of my skin or make up when i applied it
this product kept me matte pretty much throughout the whole day which is saying something because my skin is extremely oily even on my cheeks
dry out easily yet oily moisturizers always make me break out
did absolutely nothing for my oily skin
because my skin tends to break out
i always have to use several pumps because one is not enough for the entire face to feel moisturized
i like that it doesn't have a lot of the bad ingredients for the skin
not enough moisture for winter maybe i you have really oily skin all year round
i really like this face wash.
when i used a toner after cleansing i could see all kinds of dirt coming off my skin
the cleanser is so milky that it is hard to tell if it is even on your face when washing or just running off with the water
it doesn't seem to be drying to my skin
this cleanser defintely didn't get my face clean enough
it did not do a good job of removing dirt
they never cause my touchy skin to act up
it worked okay with dry skin
where i don't have dry patches
made my skin flake which some of these products do
i found it to be very sticky
it didn't absorb in
like i do when i put on the face cream
i do think it made some of my lighter scars gently peel off
i did notice about an hour after i applied it that my skin felt a bit hot like it was burning
never getting enough sleep
in winter i become combination dry.
this cream was too heavy for use on my face.
i think this would be best suited for dry skin types or used as a winter moisturizer
my face feels like there is a thick layer of product even at the end of the day
i assume because i am rougher in that area when i swipe my toner on with a cotton round
it hurt so bad i couldn't imagine what it would be like if i were sunburned or wind chapped
it feels oily when apply on the skin
the best thing about it is the spf 30 which is hard to find in a moisturizer that doesn't just sit on my face or cause breakouts
the only creme that makes me break out!
i felt that this cream was not rich enough
for someone with oily skin this might work very well
the problem with the product it had to much hydration for me
i find it a little too greasy
i put this stuff on my skin
buying the peel pads since those work absolute wonders
my face becomes even oilier after awhile
it reminded me of smashbox's primer, but worse.
does not irritate or dry out my skin
doesn't dry out my skin
it does not absord into skin
it seems to control the oil a little
but the refill 3x does good job on my skin.
it's among the oily creams that doesn't ever truly absorb into my skin
get more oily than normal
i could 4 jars of my preferred cream that has never caused my skin to breakout
this just wouldn't absorb into my skin
then if i even so much as brush my fingers against my face
apparently not dry enough to get the benefits from this cream
not so much if you have any oily areas
forget about using this with a face oil
this lotion will make you feel oilier than anything i've ever tried
it doesn't make your skin feel oily
it must have junk in it that doesn't absorb in to the skin
this oil does not sink into the skin.
it can break out your skin during hot weather.
did not soak into my skin
will leave your face with a lot of make up residues
had so much residue
i think for dry skin the residue left on the face could be helpful
this stuff is best used on dry skin
each time i used it my mascara left me looking like a raccoon
do not apply dry!
a bit raw from all the rubbing i do to try
won't make your skin oily
wouldn't recommend to just wipe it off
unfortunately this cleansing "milk" is a poor product all around
and is difficult to completely wash off.
it doesn't have the effect the balm does
you cannot put this over your eyes like you can with the balm
i also typically have dewy skin during the day
flush my eyes because the burning was so bad
the nozzle is too short that if i don't pick it up to get the product the milk goes all over the bottle
doesn't wash off easily
buy some just to feel like my face was clean at the end of the day while using this "cleansing milk
you can use a tiny bit on a cotton ball
a few pumps of this stuff
i recommend ignoring the part about how you can rinse it away with water
you will need a couple cotton squares worth of toner to finish the job
i absolutely love how this is non-drying yet does not irritate my acne prone skin
i feel like there are make up residues
i feel dirtier than when i was wearing make up properly
just made my face sticky
it didn't dry out my skin after using
there's still lots of foundation coming off afterwards w/toner
found it to be very drying for my skin
it's kind of like washing your face twice
my face gets too oily if i don't wash it directly after using the remover
this is definately not for people with oily skin
probably good for dry skin.
i looked like my face was peeling from a bad sun burn
my skin is really dry during the winter.
however i found it a bit too greasy on my face
it does not absorb well into my skin.
i don't like the sticky feeling it leaves after application
still need enough to soften the dry areas
it made my skin way too oily to use during the day
as ithe skin goes dry again after a simple morning wash with water
often will by night time creams because they are much thicker
not thick enough for a night-time cream
i love the other shiseido creams with the bio-whatever-stuff they put in it
though this cream has a luxurious feel to it when you put it on
i feel this moisturizer does a poor job of sealing in the moisture
my skin is dryer than ever before.
it may be an okay cream if major dryness is not your problem
this one is way too greasy
i would not recommend this product to people with oily nor break out prone skin
i eventually had to wash my face to get rid of the smell
i don't feel like it was enough for my dry/combination skin
i can't really say how my skin reacted to the moisturizer as i had to wash it off after a few minutes
my skin did seem a little tight even after applying it
you apply it, and never absorbed by the skin.
i don't feel it moisturizes as well as i had hoped
my face felt wet on the surface even a long time after applying
after a few hours that wet feeling translates into a dirty feeling as dust
i prefer hope in a jar for dry/sensitive skin.
it doesn't make my under eyes feel plumped up in the morning or anything
it just leaves them super shiny the next day
might as well rub gasoline on your face
i do like that it absorbs well
it's so thick that i find myself tugging under my eye to make sure i cover the whole area
i figured maybe it would soak in once it dried
it made my entire face greasy
my makeup wasn't able to settle properly with this greasy cream underneath
another plus is that it didn't create any bumps like other eye creams have caused me before
i'll admit, i've never used this cream.
mineral oil are used which are so awful for your skin
what else can you expect from a product that is essentially a $57 jar of mineral oil
i found it to be excessively oily.
that spread everywhere because of the greasiness of this product
i think it's suitable for someone who has extremely dry skin
this cream is too sticky
soon it started to really irritate my skin
i would wake up with very dry
greasy no matter how thin of a layer you put on
unless you where eye primer at all times
i find it too greasy
while i find it is too thick for my skin type
dryer skin may fare better
have some sun damage from too many hours tanning in high school
the next morning after using these wipes i had a few blemishes which i don't get
was disappointed to try these cleansing sheets only to discover that they don't easily remove makeup
they also dry out very easily
sometimes they aren't very wet
some of the sheets seem to be lacking make up remover
does not help my super oily skin stay matte at all
i don't have oily skin anymore
even with a matte primer like mufe i looked like a greasy hot dog
when i applied the moisturizer it did not feel like my skin was even absorbing it
my face is not matte looking about 10 minutes after applying it
this product does not help with greasy skin.
i learned the hard way that it does not include sunblock
my skin doesn't start out oily at the beginning of the day- it becomes oily as the day progresses
i would not recommend this if you're very oily or acne-prone
even during colder weather sometimes too
during hot weather i get sweaty
it's not full on grease-face
i do tend to get a bit shiny after 3-4 hours of applying make-up without this product
nothing mattifying at all for my oily t zone.
although i did think this moisturizer did a decent job of preventing my face from drying out
i did feel my skin to be a little dry still
if you are not the type with extremely oily skin
every time i used it i would end up with a slick oil sheen over my face
unfortunately it made my oily skin look 10 times worse
it doesn't seem to help at all controlling my oily skin
even on my cheeks where i never get oily
i love that it doesn't have a thick feel when applied
if i have a peel done
i get very dry skin in the winter
it's not a problem of moisture rather than something in it that reacts to my skin
it didn't feel like it absorbed
so although it helped my dryer spots
it made my t-zone very greasy
i found the cream was hard to apply evenly on the face
especially when the face was wet
the cream tends to stay in one area
the cream is too rich for me even i only apply a little bit at night
even in the cold temperatures, it was too much.
honestly i have drier skin
my face is okay with their chemicals.
it doesn't brighten my skin or cleanse it very well
i found this product to be too drying for my skin
can still get quite oily on the t-zone
i found it to be very drying
i decided to use another gentle face cleanser right after i cleansed with shiseido to see if the waxy feeling would disappear
figure out my issue with shiseido didn't dry my skin
shideido didn't dry my skin
do feel very dry after using it
m sometimes it feels so dry that i have to moisturize after within 2 minutes
it completely stripped off any moisture i had left in my skin
maybe it's because of the extreme cold/windy weather or that i have dry skin in the winter
i should have known as soon as i rinsed it off as my skin felt weirdly squeaky clean
i would only recommend this if you have very oily skin
you only need a very small amount to wash your face so one tube should last a long time
i will be trying one of shiseido's other cleansing foams to see if they have one that's less harsh
i wouldn't recommend it to people with dry skin.
after reading such incredible reviews i thought the shiseido white lucent brightening cleansing foam was going to be the miracle solution
not strong enough for a deep cleaning
although i'm now thinking that maybe that's because of a white powder that is in the cleanser
people who do not like the tightening feeling that some cleansers
i can't seem to get the products with sunscreen to work without tearing of the eyes
this is the only one that makes my face feel dry
you can not wear it without using a toner.
it brightens up your face a lot only when your are putting it on
though my skin type is oily it's too dry for me in the winter
i can't use this product because it is too drying for my skin
the moisture cream in this line is much better for people with dry skin
its not spf enough
feels like it's basically powder dissolved in some liquid solution when you apply it
it does everything a good moisturizer isn't supposed to do: it doesn't rub in smoothly
makes certain drier areas flaky without fail
if i try to smooth it out more by rubbing more
it gets even flakier
that seems to help the flaking issue a little bit
even for a person with semi-oily skin
did not provide enough moisture for my skin
a residue is left no matter what
i more i would rub it in, the worse it got.
it takes a very long time to soak into my skin
did not moisturize even half as well as the bmc
my skin just wouldn't absorb it at all.
i can feel it sticky on my face
this product is good if you have dry skin.
this cream is so heavy that i had to stop using it 2x a day because it was causing moderate acne
doesn't spread well on my face at all
most of the time i have to wash my face after applying it just to make my face feel a little free
that tends to be a little drier in the winter
i think clinique is costing on their reputation because this cream didn't really help depuff or erase dark circles
this product actually made my eye area dry
i will use the product until it's gone because it is super hydrating
i only use this one is to create a smooth base since its hydrating without making your skin look greasy
it does add moisture but nothing else.
my skin would have dry flakes on it just minutes after re-applying
this face wash doesn't even get dirt or make up off
i can definately say it does not have brightening effect every eye cream with this price or even cheaper than this can hydrate
the tub does last awhile though
it didn't hydrate as well as i would've thought.
i did not care for the rich version of this eye cream
it was too thick for me.
it is a thick lotion where a little goes a long way though
not sure if it is thick enough moisture for winter time
my undereye are still so dry
also wish it was in a tube- my eyes are the last place i want germs
i always have to go in with micellar water afterwards to finish getting makeup
still doesnt treat my oily face 100%
does not help the oiliness one bit
it could very well be a hand soap.
doesn't seem to make any difference in my oiliness
since this product does not foam to my liking
this face wash did help control my oily skin.
it was gentle on my skin as far as not over drying
i still had a lot of makeup on my cotton ball when i put on my toner
perhaps it would be a good choice for oilier skin types
my skin type at the time because now i am pretty sure that i have normal/dry skin with some sensitivity
has a thin sort of consistency which makes me feel as though i need more than one pump to clean my face
i've noticed that it doesn't clean my skin as well as i like
it didn't harm my skin as most cleansers do by making me break outbor overdryong it however it didn't control oil
great product for already perfect skin bit average for oily/combo / occasional break out skin
i like it for non-oily areas
however, this facial wash really disappointed me.
it doesn't lather at all
this stuff may be okay for your sensitive skin
while it did clean my skin
it doesn't lather at all.
it's a gel that you pretty much rub all over your face
this would be a great cleanser if it didn't cause my sebum production to go wild
it's like washing your face with a moisturizer i'm really irritated because now my face looks worse
can actually cause sensitive skin to turn red
it also made me a lot more oily
more oily in the summer
it didn't even feel like it cleaned my skin at all
i constantly felt like i needed to wash my face more
it refused to foam or spread or anything.
almost like it didn't want to mix with the water
i always feel like i have a milky residue leftover on my face
since i couldn't use my coconut oil with it
figured i would try this instead of the acne cleansers i had been using that dry out my face
it sometimes feels like the cleanser hasn't entirely washed off
if i don't apply moisturizer within a minute of washing my face i can feel my skin tighten
i would not recommend for someone with dry skin.
feels like there is a film on my face after i rinse it off
i can only guess this product is insufficiently moisturizing at higher altitudes or it truly stinks because using it has caused my skin to turn into s
i'll keep it just for cooling
not the jar kind
you have to wear a little or it will burn
the area does not even appear more moisturized
it feels like i'm putting nothing more than some water-down hair gel around my eyes
it does not sting or irritate
its really hard to get small amount out if u touch rhe pump
i generally don't really need an eye cream
i now have dry
the pump does give too much gel out
it has a nice texture when you apply it
we go from bad to worse with sodium hydroxymethylglycinate
it actually dried out my skin
it did not dry out my skin though.
didn't seem to reduce the size of my pores that much either
when i put it on i have to mix it around to get it to actually stay on my face since it is so clumpy
when it dries it is fairly easy to rub off
the flakes that fall off everywhere while it's drying are just annoying
which my sensitive skin did not like at all
this is not for dry skin.
it doesn't dry too much
i didn't think it removed the deep down dirt or dead layers of skin as it promises to do
it dried out my skin a bit even when i left it on for less than 10min
it worked well but you have to rub it off.
calling it a peeling mask is misleading as you are expected to rub it off with your fingers
you could squeeze the product out
it actually felt somewhat unfinished like i let soap dry on my face
it was way to dry
if your skin is oily
not too oily avoid this product at all cost
not only is it hard to dispense in the shower
you apply it to a dry face
i feel like this product caused my skin to break out even more
don't wet your face before using it
this wash does a poor job of removing oil
because i was starting to get dry patches on my face
direction say to apply when dry
so when i eventually washed it off it left my skin oily
irritated it actually caused my skin to break out even more
this made me oily
dry out my face
i am already oily
it did cause me to have dry patches wherever i applied it
which was not drying at all
i just don't enjoy having little pieces of gunk on my face
i didn't find it mattifying at all.
it made my acne come up again which irritates me so much
this would probably work better for someone with oilier skin -- i have combo skin that's very dry now that it's winter
doesn't seem to really soak in
my skin does appear less oily
the serum did not seem to prevent them from happening in the first place or reduce my surface oil
although it doesn't linger
'll need to invest into chemical peel of some sorts to get rid of the scares
unless some miracle happens till the tube ends
i think this made my skin more oily than it is.
i've tried darn near everything to clear up my skin
you're left with this gross liquid that does nothing to your face
i will switch to a different cleanser that can be used daily without causing flakiness
i don't feel much of a deep cleaning action going on
t really makes the dry parts even drier
didn't leave my skin feeling as smooth as other products i use
it is a total misnomer to call this an exfoliating wash now because it is not
my product didn't have hardly any micro beads in it
i will say that after i washed my face my skin did look great
my face doesn't break out very easily
it's almost like a coating before i put on my make-up
it makes my face less oily
my face at first did not take very well to this lotion
just wasn't enough moisture for me
thinking my skin might've not liked some ingredient in the dry version
my skin was even left dry once it absorbed
my skin was even left dry once it absorbed
i really like the thick
i guess this cream is not for someone with sensitive skin
so far all i have noticed is the sticky/tacky residue it leaves
it was too thin & did not hydrate enough.
only occasionally when i try a new eye cream that is too thick or has some ingredient that doesn't work with my skin do i get puffiness
i am starting to think that it is making the area look drier
soothing for a lot less money
i generally don't spend $100 on eye cream
just like putting plain water
even dried me out
in fact, i found it kind of sticky.
i actually felt like it made my skin more dry in the dry areas
my sensitive skin doesn't react to it which is a plus
foundation made my face less oily
it dried my skin a little too much
my mufe base mattifying primer did not work well with it
all it did was bring all the dirt to the surface
unfortunately, it does nothing for my oiliness.
i think it was too drying
skin didn't clear up either.
did feel it was drying on certain spots of my face
so on dry skin days i have to skip this product.
my t-zone is still an oil slick
my dry spots are still dry
maybe if i had super oily skin it would work?
although i have oily skin
will not recommend to anyone who has super oily skin
i think i'll stick to my fresh soy products from now on
i found that any areas that were dry became even drier almost like i had used no moisturizer at all
oddly enough the oily parts of my face became even oilier
an sa recommended this for me when my super oily skin was suffering through some dry patches
the scent doesn't hang around too long though.
does not feel sticky or greasy on my skin
i don't pay much attention to it's claim to have oil absorbent properties
it doesn't make me less oily
i do not have oily skin, more combo.
would recommend if your skin is more oily.
oil throughout the day as it is hard for me to find a good lotion
although it seems less greasy due to the oil free makeup
when i apply it to my skin
it does aid in making me less oily
however, i do not feel it really moisturizes.
i specifically need it right now with the drying winter
dry in the winter
it actually felt too dry
the cream itself was too greasy even for nighttime
feel oily and have break out even in winter.
i really needed the moisture
it really gets the oil off my face
i only use this cleanser at night because i believe that this product definitely cleans my skin from all of the dirt that i have gotten from being out for the whole day
don't need a deep cleanse when they wake up
i don't like that this already comes out as a foam because when i rub it into my face it disappears al
honestly my skin is doing better with the clinique charcoal face wash
its so hard to find a product that works for my oily
it was normal or dry everywhere else
overall more dry than oily
this is my go to face wash because it doesn't cause my acne to look worse
more acne opposed to other face washes however i still get around 5 pimples on my forehead at a time while using this so there are probably better face washes out there i'm just too afraid to try something else
makes my face oily if i use it at night?
i feel like it only gets the surface dirt
helps w acne however it dries out your skin so much
i used the whole skin care line
2 it dried out my face terribly.
it didn't make my skin worse
explained that with my oily skin type clinique was probably not the best br
i think that for dry or normal skin this product would work just fine
it drys my skin out so much that if i don't use a good moisturizer my make up looks really flaky
yes it did dry out my skin
if i keep using it every day twice a day then it helps get rid of the pimple a little quicker than normal
this gel it really powerful way too much that end in causing dry patch in my face
i would not recommend this for people with naturally dry skin or for people with sensitive skin
it doesn't clear up skin overnight
the sticky feeling discouraged me from applying it all over my face
also, it's very drying.
it dries up where you apply it
maybe my skin got used to the product
when you put it on areas around your mouth
after it dried it made my skin look like it had a sheen on it
has been using these as a sort of aftershave to help keep irritation down
although i must stress that when using this you have to pair it with a good moisturizer beacuse the alcohol dries out your really quickly
once it has soaked it i don't even notice anymore
it is no longer dry
it didn't do everything it advertises such as lightening my dark spots or changing texture on my face
doesn't clog pores though or give me any sort of reaction
f you have oily skin this product is not for you
making my face feel like it has been marinating in cold cream all night
i take care of my skin.
didn't provide remotely enogh moisture
wasn't even moisturizing enough to give me a soft result the next morning
i will say that my skin did stay more moist during the day
it didnt dry my face out
it is literally just a regular soap that doesn't leave my h
it didn't cleanse my pores like i felt it should have
this body wash didn't do anything that my normal soap wouldn't
i also took precautions such as washing my back last so that there would be no conditioner residue that would interfere
it could be drying or irritating if used more frequently
and it is so incredibly drying.
don't recommend it for dry/easily irritating skin
my face felt really sticky after i used this
my acne on my face doesn't go away like the ones on my back
this soap dried out my skin too much
even this soap was too harsh
for a bar of soap that mildly clears your skin i think a slightly lower price would be more exceptable
i don't know if it completely "combated" all of my blemishes
dried my skin around my nose which hurt even when i apply moisturizer everyday
this probably works for oily skin
it does get my skin clean right away
possibly too light for my oily skin
it doesn't seem to clean deep enough for my skin type
while this doesn't dry my skin out
it has not cleared my breakouts or helped with my oily t zone
it dried out my skin so much
this is not drying at all.
which is more on the dry side
it really dried my skin out
my skin gets more on the oily side
what i can say is that this face wash was very gentle
this is a nice lightweight product that didn't over-dry my skin
really dried me out
bought this in combination with the clear complexion cleanser hoping it would clear up
i tend to sweat here
the most it's done for me was probably provided a light moisture barrier for my skin
i do like that it adds some moisture to the skin.
i did feel like it controlled oil a bit
i will say that it dries quickly
it not only dried out my skin
plus you get half as much as the juice beauty for $5 more
i found this to be a little drying on my skin.
it may work better for someone with oily skin.
isn't too drying on my oily skin
since its not oily
i don't recommend for people who are sensitive to heavy smells
conslotion like consistency that doesn't latherdoesn't feel like it cleanses thoroughly
used it to wash you face with it
this gives a burning sensation to my skin where it is most dry
will definitely be sticking with my cleansing oil
it doesn't get my skin remotely clean
so you can cleanse for the 2nd time without drying
it seems like it was deep cleansing at all.
it doesn't really seem to cleanse my skin very well at all
however i have yet to find a cleanser from clinique that either does not flair up my rosecea
kind of felt like there was some residue left as well
it was drying on my face
it still gets dry
washing it didn't really help.
it is also not drying
which is great if you live in an arid climate
i would probably have to wash my face 20 times a day with this to keep it redness-free
i've already used almost half the bottle because it takes so much to work up a good lather
i can't imagine using this product without having extremely sensitive/red skin because it is so greasy
i didn't use it as often because it felt greasy
this seems to be for people with dry skin
as i found it very greasy
it doesn't burn my sensitive skin which is a plus
my skin is pretty dry during summer
i usually wear it by itself
i washed my face as i always do
that being said i have oily skin
this might work really well for someone who has dryer skin
this was too thick for daytime use.
better as basic moisturizer it did not cause combination skin to become oily
i will keep on using to see if my redness goes away
it irritated my skin and i had to wash it off.
it just "relieves" it when you use it
soothing when i put it on
my make up gets oily look
am now using moisture surge which seems okay
i couldn't wash it off of my face fast enough!
this is nothing like the other cream.
my skin looks the same after the mask as it does before
also like honey its hard to completely wash off your face + it makes my makeup ball
with my philosophy renewed hope in a jar moisture mask i dont have to do this
it may get rid of the dead skin
the cloth that it comes with is really what's working for taking off any dead skin
tend to use it when i feel like my skin is looking dull
i don't find that this product leaves any residue on my face
it's possible i didn't rinse well enough because my breakouts were all around the edge of my face
it does seem to help with smoothing out my skin
it inevitably causes my to break out
lingers for about half a day even if you wash your h
also the powder can make your moisturizer sticky if you've added too much
i always have to clean up the extra powder off my sink which gets annoying in a daily am rush
i always end up with more moisturizer than i would normally use if i just applied smaller amounts to my face with out mixing in a powder-
leaves a flakey mess that i have to brush off my face before i can apply my makeup
add 1/2 to 1 scoop of the fine powder to whatever product you wish to add it to
you had to mix your concoction together before applying to your face
a half scoops i find that is too much for my sensitive skin
if i use any more than a half scoop then my skin gets itchy
it would sometimes cause my skin to flake
i don't see much improvement after i used almost the entire thing except it gives a bit moisture
this cream did not help tighten my skin
i've never had dry skin around my eyes until this product
it's the only product i've used around my eyes that didn't irritate my skin or make my eyes water uncontrollably
i do not have dry skin
i know it won't work especially if you have dry under eyes when you apply concealer
if anything, it dried out my under eye area more.
feels nice, but then so does plain old lotion.
i know it's for dark circles more than moisture or wrinkles
this cream is way too sticky for me.
if anything, it's made my dry face worse.
it didn't feel heavy or greasy like some moisturizers do
any flakey skin i had before is still there when i wake up
basically did nothing for my dry/combination skin
so many people seemed to recommend for their dry skin
i wouldn't suggest this if you have dry skin.
did not benefit or hydrate my skin whatsoever
would not recommend if you're looking to hydrate your skin
my facialist recommended i stop using this to see if it was the culprit for my change in skin
its so bad for your skin
if you layer it over rose seed oil it does a good job locking it in
it was not enough moisture for my dry skin
goes on without being sticky.
in fact my skin still got oily throughout the day
once it does soak in
it doesn't even provide your skin with excess moisture
/or know if you're ok with silicones before using
not only was this thick
my skin was dryer than it was before
i don't suggest this for dry
it gets even dryer in the winter
so when i hear the words moisture surge
this moisturizer makes me face feel more dry after maybe a 1-2 weeks of using it
don't get this drying effect with long term use
it might be great for oily skin!
this formula is so light it doesn't touch my dry patches
this did not work for my seasonal dry skin
the fact it doesn't leave my skin with a greasy feeling as other moisturizers have a tendency to do
it did not for the dry flaky spots on my skin
it has an almost silicon-y texture which some people might not like
i would still need to blot it out when ready to put my primer on
it did an ok job at moisture
...and it tends to sit on top of my skin.
i feel it doesn’t really provide deep moisture in comparison to other br
because my pores are still there
it's just not for my oily skin.
i usually use my hands.
it does seem to provide extra moisture.
some areas of my face get oily throughout the day
it was just a tad too much made me feel like a cake face especially on the areas where i get oily
great for a night cream or if you have dry skin.
seemed to dry it out
did not apply evenly
maybe good for oily skin??
i wouldn't recommend for drier skin or mature types
it smells like rose water which i do not care for
i couldn't tell you how well it moisturized because i washed it off after about 20 minutes
not greasy at all
it did not make my skin red or irritated from using it
balls up if i rub my face at all--even if i apply it as thin as possible
made my skin burn almost immediately
i put it to good use though as a body cream
made sure to buff out the excess product afterwards
this product made my skin even drier
t's not enough to be used alone as a night cream for my normal to dry skin
it does absorb very easily
i just find it too drying.
it isn't the right fit for people with dry skin
in the winter it's just too drying
it irritate my eyes when i use it
i try to stay away from anything that foams
i also noticed it does not exfoliate as well as it used to as i am breaking out around my forehead
a little oily in the t-zone, but blemish free.
this was very drying
need something to break up the oil
maybe it works better for dry skin.
i think it still might be a bit dry for my skin.
used it that it was not cleaning my face
it dries the heck out of my face
also not good for dry skin
if the idea of treating wrinkle is freezing your skin
the pump doesn't even fit on the bottle
really didn't do enough for my fine lines compared to other lower-priced eye cremes
products made to go near your eyes should not sting
feels like i have saran wrap on
although i do sometimes feel a slight sting with application
does more for me than just make my eyes oily
definitely do a test patch before using.
it does clean without drying
the little pimples i sometimes get because the one i was using was useless
i must say it leaves your skin glowing
in fact i've broken out more since i've been using it since it doesn't contain salicylic acid or any type of acne controling ingredients
doesn't lather very thick either, which i prefer.
the citrus only makes it worse.
i did notice that my skin became very dry
my face feels a little tight afterwards which is interesting since it states it doesn't strip the skin of oils
find my skin dry
it took me awhile to realize that it wasn't my diet or lack of fluids that was causing the breakouts
if your skin is on the dry side
it didn't do what i really needed it to do which was get rid of or at least lighten my sun damaged areas
once you start rubbing it in
keep your $145 because this toner is not worth it
they should be able to design a container that doesn't squirt the product everywhere
i find it doesn't irritate my skin as much as the other perricone products
not dry out my skin
i wasn't a fan of the sort of oily feeling it gave me before i rinsed though
i don't find it to be very cleansing.
i feel like it actually dried my skin
my skin always felt dry after using it even after putting moisturizer on afterwards
i avoid cleansers that leave my skin feeling like that because i feel like my moisturizer won't penetrate into my skin after
maybe makes you a bit flush.
this dried out my skin like nothing i have ever experienced before
my skin still has that slippery feeling after washing it off
after a few uses i found it to be really drying
i used it for a quick wash
i would only recommend it if you have very oily skin
feels sticky after you apply it
then again i don't have extremely dry skin
the only downside is that i can't imagine anyone being able to moisturize their whole face with one pump
i don't like products that leave me feeling greasy/sticky
may work better on skin that isn't quite as dry as mine
this is forumulated for those with dry skin
very hydrating but i cant get past the smell.
the fact that you don't have to put your fingers in a jar to get the product out
nor did i like the fact that the moisturizer left a weird "film" on my face afterwards
it didn't work well with my skin
i normally have normal skin
for my dry winter face
in this warmer weather
it does absorb very quickly into your skin.
that should have given me a clue that it would probably be too moisturizing for oily skin
after using it a couple of times i found out that it just doesn't work with my oily skin
you have to really rub it in so that you don't have white streaks on your face
wet when i use it
have a sticky face all day long
it also felt like it left residue not being able to soak into the skin completely
it just makes me sweat
generally day cream should really have spf
did not help with the dryness in the slightest
my dry patches continued to be dry
i wouldn't recommend this product if you have very dry skin
probably better for folks with dry skin.
i needed something for my dry skin
after just a week of using the products i started getting dry patches of skin on my face
have you ever put foundation over a dry patch of skin?
after using for about 2 weeks i felt like it did not control my oiliness
i hate putting anything with that texture on my face as it feels too heavy
this also made me more oily
it's a bit too lacking in hydration to lay well under makeup for day use
it made my skin more oily in the long term
it's pretty hard to find a moisturizer that gets along with my skin
it doesn't even control the oiliness for a whole day
it was too heavy for my oily
it was not enough moisture for my skin especially in winter months
might be ideal with oily or oily/combo skin types
maybe good for a drier skin type that is not prone to breakouts
i ordered this because it said it wasn't drying.
unfortunately it did dry my skin out a little too much for the winter
this i was advised would help with the super greasiness on my forehead
t starts to get greasy again
still had oily skin and it made me break out.
it didnt help at all it only made my skin more oily looking
while it didn't burn
this cream is too oily for me even in winter
my face looks oily after applying it.
didn't absorb into my skin at all leaving my skin to feel very dry
it didn't cause me to break out or clog my pores thankfully
did not absorb at all into my skin
i can't even imagine how greasy it would be on someone with oily skin
i am oily in some areas
i would not purchase this because it left my face very shinny/oily
not as light and it made my face itch.
very greasy to start with
4 hours after application had to dry my skin with towel coz i didnt want breakouts
does not absorb well into my skin
i will give it a try again when the weather gets colder- maybe it will suit my skin better
the cream itself was way too thick
it was too oily and it wasn't absorbed at all.
it felt like oil on water.
i found it to be slightly greasy
not good to use underneath a foundation
doesn't help much with dry skin
i can't say i found that it absorbed quickly or felt lightweight
i in no way skimp on skin care
this cream would just not be absorbed
it looked more like i had put oil on my face rather that a moisturizer
nice but i felt like it didn't change my dryness.
it is so greasy.
when i slide my finger on my face all i feel is greasy product
perhaps if you have extremely parched
for someone with normal to oily skin this is definitely not absorbing
it can be greasy
it doesn't outweigh how thick it was
greasy on my skin when i put it on
it really didn't have any benefits to my skin other than some moisture
you can find lots of other masks that give you this hydrating effect
i used a whole jar of this mask but didn't work.
probably too drying for me now
if i'm going to do that then i expect not to see makeup on my cotton pad when i go in to tone after cleansing
this did not burn during use like the gel radiance did
doesn't dry my skin out.
doesn't dry out your skin
it did not lather at all with the clarisonic brush
this is a good product to use quickly in the shower
this might be good for oily skin
it does an ok job washing my make up off
fresh soy face wash can do a better job
i only use the tiniest amount because it really does produce a ton of lather
does feel great until i wash it off
not a perfect one for dry skin
could be better for medium to oily skin
doesn't dry out skin
i like it because it cleans well
leave a residue even if using with the clarisonic or with h
not too squeeky nor leaves residue that i've noticed
leaves a terrible filmor residue on my face that doesn't wash off with water
you know that yucky dingy feeling you get when you use certain soaps?
i always feel the need to follow up with a toner to get rid of the nasty feeling
i've gotten a lot of chemical burns from some really nice products
it seems more like baby oil
however it also made my skin really dry
especially for the water-proof variety as this is rubbish at trying to take off mascara
because i have oily
it would not rub in or absorb into my skin
i loved this oil it made my skin so soft for about 5 days then i started getting breakouts
each time i tested it made all of my hair really oily
its unacceptable for this price that the 'dropper' is unable to hold liquid without dripping
it didn't absorb into my skin even after 30mins of wear
doesn't seem the least bit moisturized
whether dry or oily
however i could see this being lovely for combination or oily skin types
there is no moisture in the air in my house- it's really dry with the heat running non-stop
so my theory is that since the hyaluronic acid can't take in any water from the air
i even have to use 2 pumps sometimes to cover my full face
still dry after using this
i found out it was because of the algae that is in it
it definitely doesn't give you that instant moisturized feel
really doesn't do much for moisture
now that the weather is getting cooler my skin is definitely drying out
this only seemed to make it dryer
noticed there isn't even any hyaluronic acid in it
found it to be too drying
i feel like if i keep rubbing on it
this product would be more useful if it came with an accompanying water mister / spritzer
apparently it's something else because i didn't get nearly the amount of moisture from this product
dried as if it was water
this product did very little to help my dry skin.
i would not recommend it for extremely dry skin.
i figured it would be worth the price if it actually got rid of the dry patches around my temples
the formula also pilled on my skin when applying makeup in spite of waiting a sufficient amount of time for the product to soak in
every winter i get really dry, flaky skin.
did not irritate my skin
this product did nothing for my dry skin.
as i find it is one of the only things on the market that keeps my dry skin from shriveling up
didn't have the effects that hyaluronic acid are supposed to have
it is great for my extra dry skin with extra oily/acne areas
in cool 50 degree weather
oily looking as though i were in high humidity
i wanted a moisturizer with spf that would not make my face as greasy as the city block
this use to be one the best moisturizers because it did not add to the oily mess on my skin
now i feel like i'm putting a layer of sticky oil to my face
this new formula caused my face to be very oily
instead of the original formula that was more of a light whipped-type moisturizer that soaked right in
it always soaked right in
it does dry relatively quickly so you aren't left too greasy
dries quick enough to apply make up right after without a wait
it's so bad that at that time i have to use either blotting paper or a loose powder or else my nose
i think the superdefense spf 25 would be great though for a person who isn't naturally oily
i don't sweat very much at all
if it gets the slightest bit warm out it starts running
this doesn't leave me greasy at all
i think it's the spf that is drying out my skin
i wouldn't recommend this for drier season
i just wanted to warn people that the oily to very oily must have something in it that causes breakouts
so stick to the very dry or combination
as others say it makes your skin more oily
i think i needed to get the one for normal to dry skin because i was so flaky with this stuff
not dry at all
now i see it is greasy
this product makes it feel even dryer
did not like it under my makeup, too thick.
it must be too oily for my skin.
if your skin reacts to harsh chemicals easily- you may want to stay away from this
the formula now makes my face look very greasy/oily
it's also much thicker/stickier than it was before
it was too greasy to use on my h
my face felt oily after use/ i would recommend this to those who require a heavier moisturizer
it has a decent amount of spf however it is very greasy
it doesn't seem as moisturizing as i expected from something labeled dry combination
good but not as good as moisture online.
the cream is not bad
instead it made my skin really really dry
i like that it has spf in it
doesn't feel heavy on your face
it didn't help my dry skin
i can't breathe normally with it
it did not even cleanse my skin
although i do suspect it's making me break out on my jawline
i think if i had oilier skin, it would be fine.
for me, it was too drying.
it hasn't dried out my skin any more than what it is
it can be drying to dry skin in early spring or during allergy season
i don't generally buy expensive face washes
it doesn't dry out my skin
i found it to be slightly drying for my sensitive skin especially in the cold season
actually i have to use it for body clean to not waste it
i would only recommend this to someone who has dry skin
it was too heavy for my combination skin even when "warming" it up between my fingers before use
it wouldn't soak in.
so much fragrance it made my eyes water every time i wore it
i good product for very dry skin if you can st
it dried my skin under my eyes really bad
it does help the skin around my eyes feel better
did not hydrate as i had hoped for and burned.
i will say it has not broken me out or clogged my pores
i found this product to be very difficult to apply due to it's thick
did not like this i couldn't get past it smelling like glue gross
it can make you look dry
it didn't make me less oily at all.
really helped my dry areas not flake as much
tend to get some dry patches here
once it dries it clings to any dry patches that you might have
i get even more oily when i wear this product.
i apply this before my make up after a while i feel as if i get extra greasy
than after i got so oily
don't wake up looking like a grease ball
does nothing to keep my skin from getting oily
not have to worry about primer--i don't like loading up my acne-prone face with so many products
i look more oily when i wear it
i love how murad's oil-control mattifier makes my skin look at first
worth the try for oily skin suffers like myself
i've never in a life time seen my face so oily
it's kinda thick at first you have to rub it in then it melts like water
then my oils would seep through as if i had never even put this on
certainly didn't leave my face matte at all
tried this hoping it would help with my oily skin
it "mattifies" so quickly i don't have the chance to rub it into my skin
i found that i didn't necessarily need to oil blot my face
doesn't spread out that well
it does a good job of keeping me less oily
if you are very oily
initially it does go on as matte
too dry for me.
make my foundation dry.
where i'm not so oily
caused my skin to break out in my oily areas
i went back to my non-spf moisturizer because it didn't cause me to break out
did not matte my face as said
it doesn't control the oil in my skin
it dried me out horribly.
especially if you have dry skin like me
this totally dried out my skin
i could hardly wash the water off my face
i found it to be too drying for my over 50 skin
stay away from foamy cleansers as they really dry me out
it drys me out.
my skin gets dry in fall
a little oily through my t-zone
i used this and my face is slick by 10am.
wasn't crazy about the feel of my skin when done washing
i found it to be a little drying
even as the weather gets warmer
this wash would lather too much
it was very hard to feel like you rinsed it off completely
light enough for me
yes it absorbed quickly which also meant that my skin felt dry about 30 mins after i applied it
if i lightly rub my face
no wonder that my skin is still as dry
maybe if your skin does not need much moisture
this product is so fragrant that i am floored that my skin did not break out or become irritated
regardless of how many oil-blotting papers i use
doesn't work on my oily
my face skin cannot absorb it at all
skin can absorb it quite well
i figured i needed a little lift for my dull skin
it is too heavy on me
i would got up with a greasy-sticky feeling face in the morning
it's a thick cream better suited for winter time because as it got warmer i was sure to wake up with greasy skin anyway
this cream might be better suited for a really dry skin type
the day cream from this line so naturally i thought the night cream would rock too
i find it a bit greasy
that was because this product has a drying effect on my skin
can cause them to water
in fact, it was drying and made me look older.
this is not the best line filling cream out there
this cream burns really bad when you apply it.
i agree with the other reviews that this eye creme is too drying
it was so drying that it caused me to years older
the pump is horrible it squirts out everywhere no matter how carful i use it
the last 10% of the bottle was unusable because the lotion separated from the oil so much that the last bit of product was useless
i tend to get really dry
left me skin kind of dry
it's a nice eye product- stir it well to mix all the ingredients- it tends to separate
might be because it's drier
it didn't do anything for me except dry my oily skin out
still i could not stop the peeling
i could not live with all that peeling skin
i am not sure if the peeling eventually stops
my t-zone tends to get oily
didn't help my dry skin
said it didn't help her dry skin
not a sticky one a nice one
i don't have sensitive skin either so for this to be a daily moisturizer i expected it to be more gentle
the weather has been really dry
i feel if i used this twice a day my skin would not get enough moisture
it doesn't make my sensitive skin break out
does not absorb well into the skin
not the best for oily skin
didn't feel like it absorbed completely into my skin
not for dry skin.
it comes in what seems like a large tub
you could feel the stickiness linger on your face all day
it might be the cold weather
it would be better for combination to oily skin.
i suspect that this might be an amazing moisturizer for those with combination to moderately oily skin
did nothing for my dry sensitive skin---broke out
though i do tend to be a little oily the next morning
i think this would be perfect for someone with more dry skin that isn't prone to breakouts though
this is not a cream for people with dry
it completely dried out my skin to the point that it hurts
after reading other reviews complaining about it drying out their skin
should be labeled for oily skin
beware for those who have sensitive non oily skin
while you do wash it off
i found this wash to be just ok
all this did for me was make my skin terribly dry
after a while i wasn't even sure if it was cleaning my skin properly
good for teen skin that's extra oily.
too drying for my sensitive combo skin-returning it
the oil free cream so this line must just not work for my skin type
i happen to have sensitive skin
t dried me out
then did dry the skin out around my mouth
my skin dried out so badly after using this wash.
i think the ingredients here dried out my skin so much that i got those little bumps all over my face
now this cleanser is still nice if you don't have bad skin: it doesn't dry out your skin
it didn't irritate my skin at all
after doing my research it is suppose to do that it is a detox so that's detoxing your face to prevent long term break outs
it's drying out my skin in some areas
it was also a little drying on my combination skin
it dried my skin out even more even when i was pairing it with her goat's milk moisturizer
this really just made my skin super dry on everything else
the only thing i love about this product is it doesn't dry out my skin
it was too drying for my dry skin
the pump is the push down type which i haven't really seen in a moisturizer before
oily skin so that might be why
my skin would feel dry later in the day.
i do not have oily skin
those products were leaving my skin extra dry
no moisture, no nothing.
because i sometimes need a bit more moisture than this provides
i feel like it doesn't give me enough moisture.
some really oily spots
my skin does not absorb it
it drys out my skin as well drys up on my skin too much
i need so much more moisture then this
absorbs so quickly i felt like i needed to keep putting it on as i couldnt get enough moisture from it
it got the job done i have oily/ combo skin
this really dried out my skin.
i also don't think it hydrates the skin enough--i find that my skin is still a bit dry after this has soaked into my skin for 10-15 minutes
the smell is a little like plastic bottles that sit in the heat too long
although this is one of very few moisturizers that didn't break me out
even if i applied it when my face was slightly damp
my skin is back to its normally just oily state
even though my skin is no longer dry
especially if you have oily skin is important
your skin will just produce more oil if it's not getting the proper hydration
after using this product once my skin was dry
i do not believe it was moisturizing enough for autumn/winter as my skin still felt dry after application of the product
it really doesnt feel like enough moisture for the winter
i don't think this is helping with wrinkles because my skin still feels really dry
which i don't usually have issues with unless there's a chemical sunscreen involved
unfortunately this was no where moisturizing enough to stop my skin from flaking at the end of the day
it was too drying for me
i didn't like how the drying effect made my fine line appear much deeper than before
that's actually no accurate because i felt like greek yogurt did more for my face than this lotion
this completely dried out my skin to the point where it was peeling
it still dried out my skin
first, it will make your skin purge like crazy.
that's right after you already washed the lotion off
the only thing it did was stained my pillows
it made my face tight and would make me itch.
i found it very drying for me
which is odd since i rarely find anything that dries me out
it was still very drying
it does soak in okay
got rid of my dry spots without making the rest of me oily
my skin definitely felt more oily at the end of the day
i ended up needing to exfoliate much more often while using this
look greasy throughout the whole day
my normally dry skin was either greasy at the end of the day
i feel like it's more sanitary than dipping my fingers into a jar
then i start to realize that it's not hydrating enough
then does not lock the moisture
no need to dip your fingers into it
not enough moisture if you have flaky dry skin
for some reason it makes my skin feel very hot after applying
it just makes my face heat up for some reason
maybe those with oily skin may like this more than i did
i am keeping using it for now because it is one of the few moisturizers that doesn't irritate my skin
second, there's not enough moisture.
believe it or not it actually dried my skin out
in the end i had to admit to myself that it was actually making my skin oilier during the day
it doesn't seem to absorb at all: feels greasy for a long time
however i got massively dry skin around my nose
the winter weather was turning very cold
i think it was a mixture of all of the above that lead to my dry skin
so just keep in mind this may cause an additive effect to dry skin
as it's the only way i can get him to exfoliate
did nothing for my oily skin.
it also did not break out my oily skin.
it's too dry for my skin
this product leaves my skin too dry after i use it
not for dry skin at all
it didn't help with dull skin
i tend to have dry skin as well.
it felt like i had residue or second layer on my face
def returning it for a price tag of $150 i expected it to not clog my pores so badly
find the cream a little too heavy for me
it takes a little getting used to so as not to get too much cream out of the dispenser
it did not feel oily
neither provided any results i wouldn't get from any plain old moisturizer
needs me feeling like i need more moisture around the eye area
why my pores were getting this clogged until i actually read the ingredient list
so many better serums on the market so don't waste your money on this one
it's too much oil unless you are extremely dry.
it does seem to maintain my skin
may try the oil free one for summer as this one is a tad oily for my skin
not like oil heavy
to me it felt like oily silicone sitting on the surface of my face that wouldn't absorb into my skin
i like the oily
certainly did not quench my skin
it made it a bit dry
this just seems to sit on my dry skin
does not actually impart moisture into it
it did help with the flakiness
even with dry skin
my skin looked even flakier than before i applied it
looked just as dry
perhaps i will need to layer with other products to keep the moisture in
it doesn't take off water proof eye makeup all too well either
at first i thought this cleansing foam was alright
i just assumed that was all these great-for-your-skin ingredients actually staying on my face instead of rinsing down the drain
will clean face very well without striping all good natural occurring oils in your face
i do not recommend for dry or sensitive skin.
it just makes my face too dry
this is too drying for my skin in the dry months
that i have never had a cleanser get my face cleaner than this does
however, it is very drying.
who thought it was a good idea to put strong fragrance in a face wash?
one thing i did enjoy about this product was that it had a great fragrance that definitely lingered on after washing my face
it it not made well that when the oil squirts out
practically tipping over if you look at it funny with a lid that comes off every time it tips
how it dried my skin out
pros: it does clean your skin
leaves it feeling neither greasy nor dry
every time i use it i cringe plus i have to wash my face with like four squirts
this "cleansing oil" just did not deliver
leaves a light layer on my skin so that i don't feel dried out
it seems difficult to fully rinse this off your face
i like to splash water on my face before i wash it to wake my skin up
i did not have the taste issue with the amore pacific cleansing oil
i really wanted to love this as i like something lighter for the warmer weather
it didn't even touch my dry spots
your skin isn't that dry to begin with
not add extra oil to my oily face
i washed my face like i usually do
washing it off once wasn't enough because the smell was still lingering
as much as it costs that it made my skin super oily
don't look like i could fry an egg with my face
i so badly wanted to enjoy this product since i have their enzyme peel
my skin is very particular when it comes to products that leave a sticky residue on it
to me it smells like i've applied metals on my face or something
the only way to get rid of it is to wash it off again
face a lot less oily
i didn't feel my face was oily
in fact, i think my skin looks drier.
i liked the other moisture product that fights aging however it was more expensive
the more oily it started making me
i felt it didn't give me the same effects as the rejuvenating cream
if you use too much your face will begin to feel sticky
it didn't provide me with the moisture i need during these cold winter months
creamy or thought by the end of the day i was a little dry- maybe it's my changing skin
i honestly just think it's because my skin is clean after washing to put it on
definitely the most drying serum i have ever used
it seems to just make my skin dry.
it does give my skin a nice flush after i put it on
this product actually seems to irritate my skin more than it helps it
what i didn't like was the fact that it made my already acne prone skin more oily
didn't wash it off
maybe my skin is too dry for it
my skin is a little break-out prone
i though it may have been my moisturizer or weather change
it didn't even turn blue like it said on the directions or make blackheads any easier to extract
maybe it sticks to its description in that it may loosen the blackhead
i looked like i had sunburn when i washed it away
it will not pull all of your blackheads out on the first use
i would recommend a clay mask if you want pore tightening effects
have to be careful with the sun
this product burns my face when i use it
you can find you black head on your nose again
it shouldn't be used more than twice per week especially if you exfoliate weekly
really struggling with finding a blackhead solution was hoping this was it
so large that sometimes when i'm just looking at him casually i can notice whiteheads
this product was way too runny for me.
do your body some good from the inside
it seemed to dry with a powder finish
i am over 40 but still have oily skin.
one squirt no matter how carefully done
it has a very strong fish smell which i cannot get past this
easily suffer from dryness if using the wrong products
i can also have extremely dry patches
no matter what i would wake up with patches peeling off my skin
it made me face burn
though it does make your skin super soft after you remove it
a bit dry after use
because my face is sometime oily
it didn't even make my skin less oily.
it does clear up some of my blemishes
it's difficult to work into the skin.
i found that it would dry to a matte finish very quickly
my face would feel dry not long after applying it
when i put it on it felt a tad too rich for my already oily skin
i would give it two stars just based on the fact that it really moisturizer my skin so perhaps it would be better with more drier skin types
don't waste your money on this cream.
non-oily skin i'm sure it would be great
i suppose it was just too heavy for my skin type--i even used the one in the pump
it did not absorb into my skin
my face is oily in the t-zone
i can feel it lingering on the top of my skin even though i rubbed it in quite well
i would definitely not recommend this for oily or combination skin
it might work for someone with extremely dry skin
doesn't cause me to break out or appear sticky or greasy
beware if your skin can't handle a heavy cream.
didn't really absorb into my skin.
if you start searching perricone cold plasma
not sure who thought it would be a great idea to release a face moisturizer that smells like wet dog
it does not dissipate either.
it's as if you're slathering rotten fish on your face
maybe onto a good diet here
or if problems with heat during distri
i didn't mind my skin being oily
the smell doesn't seem to fade away with time either
he told me people would think i have gangrene unless i washed it off
i almost feel like my skin is slightly dried out from this
no matter how many times i washed my h
if you grew up near the ocean or a harbor it might not bother you
i honestly can't even attest to its performance because i had to wash if off immediately after putting it on due to the horrible fishy smell
the smell is so awful that i have been resorting to slathering the most heavily perfumed products i have
face to try to cover the smell--it is actually turning my stomach
like you're slathering old fish oil all over your face
plus it didn't add any moisture to my skin
i would recommend this to people with normal to dryer skin
i could feel the moisturizer sitting on parts of my face
gave too much of a shine to my already oil-prone skin
some days it seems like it starts to rub against other products
i will be switching back to moisture surge though when i finish this jar
this would be perfect if it was meant for super oily skin
definitely not those for have oily
even then it becomes too greasy during the day
even though my skin is oily i still need some moisture
be careful not to use this too often if your skin is naturally oily otherwise you'll be wringing your face out all day
maybe in the morning after washing my face if i feel dry
i think this cream is a little drying.
you have combination skin or dry skin.
weather gets dry at times
it made my eyes water that was when i noticed that water makes the cream ball up which looks ridiculous
what i like about it is how quickly my skin absorbs it
i would recommend this if anyone has more oilier skin
this product does make the eye area feel moist
it did not reduce any of my bagginess or dark circles
you have to barely use any to avoid your lids from sticking together
left a greasy looking residue every time i applied it
however it is too slick for use as a day cream.
i like a richer cream which this is not.
usually you get milium if your eye cream is too intense for you
it didn't magically remove any fine lines
i found it to be a little too oily for me
doesn't even make my skin feel clean just dry
wouldn't recommend for combo skin in summer when you need the moisture the most
it didn't feel like it deep cleaning my skin
my dry skin would say otherwise
no matter how hard i scrubbed
even if i washed twice
there would still be residue on my white towel
i prefer something more deep cleansing
i found the product to be quite drying to my skin
much like using regular bar soap would be
because it fails to cleanse my face property
t's not gone even after being rinsed
it wasn't keeping my skin clear which is what i look for in a daily cleanser
its such a disappointment because i like using this face wash
i also enjoy how it suds just enough to feel clean
living in midwest us i definitely need something a little more hydrating
probably not because i am on the hunt to find that all in one facial cleanser
found it to be too drying for my face/neck
my skin would immediately feel tight after i used it
would start to get noticeably dry if i didn't immediately apply moisturizer
unfortunately this face wash didn't do any better than my $5 tube of st ives face wash
it didn't dry it out either
so that my eye area was very wet
liquid that doesnt do anything
all it does is make my under eye feel cooler which i don't need it to
didn't really feel it helped with any of my undereye skin concerns
it does feel cool when applied due to the ball roller
it definitely tingles when you apply it.
i think they're starting to dissipate
i think this drys out the undereye
when you apply this it burns under your eyes to the point where i had to actually take my towel
this product burns under my eyes every time i use it
i do not put it in my eyes on purpose the product is runny
fortunately, it is not drying up my eye area.
every time i applied it my skin
eyes would burn so bad
i found it rather drying
it does tingle a little for awhile.
it's good for dry skin, not for mine.
i really would not recommend this for any of my oily skinned friends
anyone who may have dry patches or dry skin
which causes my skin to be really dry
i tried washing it off so many times
it didn't sink into the skin at all
i do like the moisture it gives
i guess i have more dry to normal skin
there is always white leftover unless you really rub in over
it just won't absorb into my skin no matter what toner/mask/cleaning solution i use
you would expect a thicker product
i would recommend more for burning skin that needs to be cooled off
gets very dry as soon as fall comes around
it just made me look a bit extra oily
i don't have any kind of intense redness on my face- i get sort of red after i shower
i tried this serum with the hope that it'd make my skin appear less red
it not a part of my skin care routine
i do like the texture of this though.
i didn't find it drying which is surprising
did not dry out skin
while its great that it doesn't irritate
for the high price tag i expected to see some peeling/exfoliating or some kind of change to my skin
don't like the bottle hard to apply without it dripping
as soon as i put a drop of the serum on my finger i was slightly concerned at its oily consistency
it practically evaporates before i can get it to my face
i got these little white heads that you tend to get with greasy products
i will have to say that this really dried my skin out
every time i pump it the liquid gets all over the bottle
probably better for those with very dry skin.
go in the shower since it must be used on a dry face
i found myself wanting to wash my face before using this so not to spread around oil makeup
maybe i'm just not used to the residue yet
when i used this ultimate cleasing oil i had trouble in my t-zone areas with pimples
i even actually have dry skin
i discovered this cleansing oil was too much for me
even if you have dry skin
lastly, spalsh your face with water.
just a bit more moisture would be great.
seemed to actually control the shine of my crazy-oily-within-an-hour skin
i really wanted to like this stuff especially after i saw my pores disappear under my make up
drying don't like this product
i didn't really give it a real try for the anti aging because my skin was way to oily
i think i will stick with the option that keeps my wallet fatter
does not feel greasy
my eyes would be watering like crazy
it did dry my skin
while this lotion is not greasy- it actually dried my skin to flakiness in places
it's done nothing to tame my oily skin during the day
it didn't smooth my skin or "mattify" my oil.
this item seems like it would be just perfect for a woman of a certain age with oily skin
this one doesn't keep me from getting slick
i would not recommend it to those with combination skin because it will be drying in the areas of your face that are not oily
or if it was my body chemistry
it does absorb some of the oil
i just purchased this product because i have very oily skin
this made my face twice as oily
i think my skin actually got more oily w/ use.
this made my dry skin worse.
i don't mind the sticky consistency
i applied this to my skin when it was really dry
thick and sticky when going on.
too greasy and doesn't improve my skin.
it didn't just burn
ten minutes later i still have the itchy/burning sensation even though i have rewashed my face
this product was so greasy and heavy on my face.
it is way too greasy and heavy.
it totally didn't work with my combo/oily skin
it completely dried me out.
now my face burns every time i try to wash my face
even water makes my face burn when i'm in the shower
it completely dried me out.
now my face burns every time i try to wash my face
even water makes my face burn when i'm in the shower
either it's too strong or i'm allergic to something in it because my skin was destroyed after using it a few times
makes jokes asking if i used olive oil :
it may absorb quickly for people with dry skin.
some moisture qualities to it which would be find in the hot
for winter i wanted something thicker or more moisturizing to fight off those fine lines
it caused my skin to peel because of how dry it made it
i don't get any degree of foaming from it
if you're okay with a slight layer of oil/feeling that you have a light thin film of oil on your face
i will say that the texture of the cleansing oil feels nice
a little bit too oily for me.
however, do need to clean up my eyes saperately.
it sometimes makes me have small breakouts
there's nothing better for any skin type to cleanse
no--they don't make your skin oily--far from it
it is an oil based product that actually leaves a sheen of oil on your face
my face was covered in more oil than the exxon valdez spill
i literally could have fried an egg on my face.
i can see this working really well for people with dry or extremely dry skin
with winter being here i thought i'd try something a tad more moisturizing in order to avoid dry patches
i decided to try the cool cleansing oil after reading all of the hype around it
so half way through the treatment there is nothing left on the brush or your face
i guess i just don't like washing my face with an oil type product
i would've been better off not washing my face all together
after seeing it didn't do anything for my acne i kept it in the shower
it also does not foam
'm guessing i had leftover dirt
seemed to get a really good cleanse from it
horrible didn't do anything for my acne my skin stayed the same except it really made my skin dry
if your breaking out from an acne clarifying products your skin is not liking it
it also felt drying.
i may as well have washed with just water.
i feel as though my skin stays in better control using other products during bad breakouts
she agreed that it was too drying for normal skin
as the weather is getting warmer
i did break out in a few small zits when i used this
it still feels dry after using this which in turn has made the texture very rough
it also feels as though my face is overcompensating for the lack of moisture by producing more oil
i definitely recommend this for oilier combo skin types though
i found that my skin dried out quite quickly after using this
it was light enough that i didn't look like an oil slick
this is great for people with normal to oily skin because of its waterlike consistency
yet if you have dry skin
unfortunately it made my face burn after i applied it
made me real oily.
made my skin feel more oily than i would like
it's just not enough moisture for me.
in the morning my skin tends to be more dry so before putting on my makeup
at night when my skin is more oily i do not use it because i prefer sleeping without anything on my face
the fact that it doesn't even come in a box or plastic on the pump is kind of gross
which means i need both water moisture
let's just start off by with the fact that it is not very moisturizing for someone with combination skin
it hydrates don't get me wrong
which i find strange since i have really oily skin
the daily face cream ended up making parts of my face too oily
beware if you have combination skin or dry skin.
i usually have clear skin
it did not provide enough moisture for my dry areas
or it is super sticky
now my cheeks are starting to get oily when they never were before
it works for my dry/sensitive skin -- i give the product itself four stars
it makes your under-eye area feel tight after 15 minutes or so
i really haven't noticed a difference when i apply it except it really dries out the outside corners of my eyes
i keep it it the fridge
t feels cooler when applying
i do like using it to massage the eye area though
you are pulling your delicate eye area which is not good
while it does feel refreshing when you keep it in the fridge
it gives a cooling effect the moment you put it on
i guess i should steer clear of serum/gel when it comes to eye care
this roller serum did feel good while i was putting it on
the good news is that this doesn't irritate my super sensitive eyes--no burning
feels cool when you apply it
i did not see any results at all withi this "de-puffing" eye massage
what i also did not expect is dries very quickly during the winter time leaving a fine line around my eye area
i feel it does not really absorb into skin
feel that this serum doesn't do enough for my dryness
it almost had a drying effect on my skin
i do not normally have sensitive skin
this *serum* is more like a cream in a pump
so thick that i have to cut it with another product to smooth it on my face
definitely for dry dry dry skin.
i would definitely recommend this for someone with dry to normal skin
alcohol that it can irritate the skin just as much as it soothes it
i didn't like it just because i need more rich creams
it didn't absorb well
for my super dry skin it barely was sufficient
but this product is greasy for me.
dry skin, so not suitable for t area
he even told me the dior skin care line is really mild
did dior change up their ingredients a bit??
i hate how it rolls off instead of being absorbed like it used to
when first putting it on it had a nice cream gel consistency
it does absorb quickly but doesn't leave me dry.
i find it to be drying
the next day my undereye was flakey
if you are going for moisture don't waste money on this
does not get completely get rid of the dark circles
it wasn't oily or cause my face to get greasy
it didn't dry my face out
beware if you have blemish prone skin
lots of things make me break out or itch
i will return this item as it broke my skin out in little white pimples
this may be best for oily skin
i guess it gets your skin pretty clean
f you have oily skin this might be for you
only time will tell if it "freezes" your face as it looks now
i will say though that the foam is amazing if you use the brush
you can just keep foaming it up in your h
use a little on your face
it actually made the fine lines by my mouth show more which also happened with a perricone moisturizer as well
i will say it is very hydrating if you can put up with the unpleasant scent
the first time i put it on i thought there was a wet-dog smell coming from wet towels or something
i don't know if it got really cold or why the plastic turned brittle
it dries out the skin just giving it a hint of improvement
i feel like i put sardine oil on my eyes.
i guess my skin is more important than the smell
something in it is making my eyes sticky
i simply could not get past the fish smell
i found it to be greasy
i will just stick to cold plasma which is pretty for both face
this night cream does help make your other night cream work better
although the cold plasma eye serum seems to do a nice job
the cold plasma for the face knowing that perricone products usually have a strong smell
i wound up washing my face to get it off cause i couldn't go to sleep with that smell creeping up my nose
face creams stunk so much that i had to return them
the odor of fish at low tide was so strong it became an effort merely to motivate myself to open the jar
perricone must be out of his chump to charge such prices for stuff that smells like rotten fish
the sticky feeling of having sunscreen on my skin never went away
like if i'd applied straight banana boat spf or even an overnight oil under my makeup
this might be good if you have really dry skin
my makeup slides off over it even if i let it soak in for 15 minutes
unless you're at the beach or something where everyone looks greasy from sunscreen then this isn't the look i'd choose on the daily
i found it much too greasy to be a makeup base
wouldn't recommend for dry skin.
t stayed greasy on your skin
i think people with dry skin would like the dewy finish better
but other then that it is really soft on my skin!
i am not one to complain about thicker lotions that go on "heavy
it sure does sit heavy on my skin
by 10 am my face would be an oil slick.
i may try again during the colder, dry months.
this one doesn't sting at all
however, i found this product to be so so greasy.
it doesn't sink in at all
so probably not the best for combination / oily skin
've noticed that my skin is greasy right after i put this product on
avoid this if your skin is sensitive.
it doesn't look oily
or if i blow dry my hair after applying
if you get even the smallest amount in or around your mouth you can taste it for hours
wouldn't allow my foundation to be applied without feeling sticky still
this is not helping relieve my dry
as if i had a sun burn
it also did not absorb well into my dry skin.
if you do too i suggest the aforementioned ultra repair creme
it may be too much moisture for oily skin
but, i could not take the greasy feeling.
the moisturizer tends to ball up even after being left on for awhile
that it would help control my oily skin
does not dry out my skin
i usually have oily skin
you rub them together
in the winter months i have pretty typical dry skin
by the end of the day i usually found my skin was somewhat oily
not sure if it's supposed to peel my skin off?
even my oily spots
i don't even feel like it moisturized my face at all
i feel like it dried it out
it doesn't give me enough moisture
it left me very oily even when i used less
i can imagine this being good for very oily people
my skin can be oily
it is not oily enough for this stuff
did not provide enough moisture
i would not use this product if you have dry skin
i will say that it dries quickly
only for the driest of skin, is my guess.
it did not dry out my skin
i did not find that it cleansed my skin well enough
because it was not cleaning my skin well
i found it to be very unpleasant
i really wanted to love this i needed something mild to follow my masques as a cleanser when removing them this was gentle
didn't make my skin worse or better just made me feel a little uncomfortable
i wasn't sure if it was from the cleanser or if it was from the fact that there was still makeup residue left on my face after using it
maybe this is from dry
supposed to be great for getting toxins out
my biggest problem with this cleanser is that it is very thick
it leaves a weird film on your face no matter how much you rinse
it's hard to find products that are free of all the gunk you don't want to be putting on your skin
do more research for another type of face wash
i feel like this clay cleanser didn't do much for me
it helped my skin, but kind of dried it.
it leaves a residue that i did not like
i break out from food i eat/stress
didn't help my dry skin
it did not provide me with enough moisture.
good added moisture for dry winter weather
even though i have some dry spots
it kept on making my skin drier than it was
it just made me very oily
my skin did seem less red with use
which is already super dry
one pump was enough for me to slather my face
i guess it would be more suitable for oily skin
instead found my face to be dry
it is actually quite drying
i noticed my skin was more oily the next day
i've found that it actually makes my skin dryer?
i consistently wake up with dry skin
this is not usual as i have an oily complexion
it did not help my oily
perhaps i'll only use this when my skin's the driest in the winter
might be better with for dryer skin types.
the waiting time was so long that made my cheeks feel dry
it did not remove dry skin nor did it clean my pores
in fact, it left me with more dry patches.
i mean it's okay i does remove some sebum
it didn't pull anything out of my pores or smooth my skin
it doesn't hurt to peel off surprisingly
you have to apply a thick layer so the bottle doesn't last very long
it did nothing it looked like i applyed a real thin layer
you can even wash it with water
endless u wash it off with water.
i seen nothing on my peel
what it does when it dried
i will just continue to use the nose strips for i feel like it works best for my nose
f you have small baby hairs on your face it will rip them out
it doesn't remove blackheads let alone do anything for my skin
does not work at all it's too thin to actually be able to grab any impurities
both times it did not remove impurities or make my skin look or feel different
didn't work well): this mask took forever to dry.
that it wouldn't be harsh on my skin
also, this takes forever to dry down.
notice that they don't mention anything about it stripping them of blackheads
it is so hard to find a decent charcoal peel off!
the mask does peel off your skin however it does not remove blackheads or much of anything for that matter
if you want smooth skin spend the money on a different mask
not pretty when you have sticky black goop on your face
when i peel it off it just pulls them to the surface making them more visible than they already were
so not worth 30 bucks it is not a pore mask at all doesn't remove any black heads all it did was get some dry skin off
it hurt so bad to peel off!!!
whatever you do don't get it stuck in the fine baby hairs around your face
it really didn't affect them at all regardless of how thick the layer was or how open my pores were
without seeing any pore cleaning i would not purchase again
dried out my skin the next day- it felt so parched
those who have oily skin
every time i don't notice any difference except for the fact that it's peeled some of the skin off of my nose
you have to apply thick layers to get this to work properly
it's super sticky making it super difficult to get an even layer on your face
this mask doesn't pull out any blackheads or anything
thought it would be a product manly enough to try to get rid of his black heads
when you're trying to peel it off out feels thin
it felt like my skin wasn't absorbing it or something
it was not good for my normal/dry skin
it caused me to have dry patches
after using it for a week i noticed the "glow" effect would just make me look greasy
it's a no for me maybe good for someone with dry or normal skin
it just was not for my skin
aside from the pros i just cant get over the heavy scent
i notice my skin gets a little oily from it.
it sometimes makes my eyes water
you have to really rub this into the skin
my skin has gone from oily to normal
it made me super oily
it pills terribly so that you end up with white
it did not help improve my skin texture or remove fine lines
i don't like how it had the silicone-like texture
this product pills on top of my skin rather than sink in
it just seems like it wastes some of the serum
it doesn't get to absorb into the skin very well
my main complaint is that it is so thick that you really can't "dab" it on the skin the way most experts suggest with the eye area
you actually need to rub it across the skin
i just found it way too greasy
too thick, did not go on smoothly.
i could see it really soaked it quickly
i found it to be very greasy
which tend to dry out this time of year
i cannot tell any difference in the murad cream than in other much less expensive creams
this just didn't provide enough moisture for my dry skin
i don't feel it penetrates as well as it could.
got this since my skin was a little drier than combo because of the winter weather
now it doesn't keep my face moist for more than 2-3 hours
this was recommended because i have dry skin
it really packs in the moisture, that's for sure.
almost too much moisture
i prefer the clinique moisture surge extended thirst relief because it does last longer
it didn't make my combination skin break out
maybe my face is just extremely dry
it doesn't sink in very well
there was so much residue left
i could see it all on the cotton pad after i used toner on my skin
don't leave your skin still dirty
did not over dry my skin when i applied it twice a day
t dries up so quick on your face
does not cause my oily skin to feel greasy
i would go with oils instead of this product for all my dry ladies
it was terrible for my dry skin in the winter
developed 5 dry patches on my face that would not only flake
maybe even dry skin in more humid climates
i need that as my skin gets dryer in the saskatchewan winters
ts kind of a thick texture which would be better for dry skin/winter days
that can have both oily
it did prevent me from getting flaky skin like any other moisturizers would do
my issue with this product is that it takes it's time for the product to absorb into my skin
everything i want in a facial cream except it burns my product tolerant skin :/ though it seems to work fabulously for everyone else guess its just not for me
f you have quite dry skin
it doesn't do much else apart from hydrating.
after i apply this i tend to feel a bit more oily
i think it was the algae in it
i felt like i could never put enough of this one to hydrate my very dry skin
doesn't do much for my very dry under eyes
i don't know which ingredient made my eyes itch
i didn't have any reactions except for some occasional watering
after using it i realized i would prefer an anti aging eye cream
i find it causes my eye make up to run
when all i needed was some lightweight moisture
i even wait a bit for the cream to absorb
which tends to crease no matter what on me
this would be a good beginners eye cream or for someone with oily skin around the eyes
it wasnt very hydrating which is why i'm returning it since the weather is changing i need something that has more moisture
even tho i have extremely oily skin i tend to stay away from this during colder months of winter since it can be drying
this product is probably better for someone with dry skin
the fact that is does not dry out my skin
there is still quite a bit of makeup that comes off on the cotton ball
air every time you use it
it still makes my skin flakes every time i use it
might be good for someone with dry skin.
which is what i do with sunblocks that don't work on my face
it does absorb quickly although the texture is kind of thick when you first apply
honestly i feel this is better for dry skin.
dry skin ladies give this a try.
my summer oily mess of a face did not like this moisturizer
like they all say, magic in a jar!
it's a little too much sometimes i'd recommend only using a little at a time because sometimes it makes my skin look too dewy
it will sometimes be wet looking
i do get dry patches after a blemish goes away
it didn't help that dry skin
if i could justify the price tag for a body/hair oil i'd bathe in this stuff
(note: i break out very infrequently)
i mean, cool, its oil for your face.
didn't help with dry peely skin
unfortunately this product just sat on my skin -- didn't saturate
seemed like a good idea -- an oil to really alleviate dry skin
my skin didn't seem to absorb it
it just made me greasy
i didn't like the messiness the oil caused on the bottle
there might be a bit more of a dewy look to my face
requires body heat to be loose enough to pat on sensitive area
it makes my eyes water so much
i can't seem to get my skin texture back.
it does not moisture enough for the fine winkles to be disappear like lamer eye creams does
i am not sure if it's from this or my new urban decay eyeliner
thought i would spend a pretty penny on this to fix some under eye dryness
it just hydrated the area you do need very little since it is so thick
t does feel greasy then
it turned out to be too sticky
if you put on too much it leaves a white film
i could feel it "tighten" as it dried
i mixed it in with my argan moisturizer because i read that so many people had a white residue left on their face
i didn't have any white residue when i applied it this way
i couldn't wait to wash it off.
'm not sure it has any benefit after its washed/rinsed off
if it dried clear i'd give it 5 stars.
if you use it alone it leaves white marks
if any water touches it
can't wait with makeup as left poor residue
the residue can be a problem tricky
not impossible if thinly spread then cream moisturizer bad with oil
which is that any moisture you put on top of it will essentially dissolve the product
it suggest you pat off with a damp cloth.
you wash the product off
if you put on too thick it leaves a cakey residue on your face
when you apply this product it tightens your face
when you pat dry your face it goes back to the before state
it felt as if i had applied glue.
feels so tight on your face it feels like you have gum or something on your face
if you use it like it says on the bottle with water
my skin couldn't breathe after a week of use
the white film residue is just way too much
i might like it better when the weather warms.
if it just didn't have the white film that has to be rinsed
you always have a white film on your face.
if i can get it to go away with a light light touch of water
if you get the white powder to disappear
once you put a different cream on to get rid of the residue the amazing effect goes with it
unless you're willing to walk around with the powdery residue on your face
unfortunately i couldn't get the white residue to go away
i agree with the other reviewers who say they experienced a white filmy residue on their skin
nothing prevented me from looking as if i had a terrible flakey white crusty residue on my face where i had applied the product
ive tried every technique imagineable to get rid of the white residue
this would be perfect if it didnt come with the white residue
unfortunately it also made my sensitive skin burn a little bit throughout the day
knowing it would make my skin red
it is actually quite drying
maybe this is perfect if you have normal to dry skin
this dried my skin to no end
i'd recommend this to someone with very dry skin.
for some reason without changing my face wash routine it made my skin more red
it does not leave it as smooth as other creams
otherwise i'll go with another cream
i almost never stray from my usual skincare routine for this very reason
this worked great on the oily parts of my face
i would recomend it as more of a warm weather product
do not think it is hydrating enough for the cold winter months
if anything this made my skin so dry
oily that i had to stop using it
still when i move my face i can feel it pulling like it's still dry
i hope this would help with my dry winter skin.
i couldn't even get it to absorb into my skin.
this cream was just too thick
it still didn't absorb into my skin
almost the same effect you get when you rub glue between you fingers
it didn't glide on my face as smoothly as i want it
wait for my face to dry
it does tend to "ball up" if you rub it in too well
you almost need to just dab it on
omg my skin started burning like it had chemicals on it
the worst thing about it is that it balls up underneath my makeup
it does come in a convenient container—when you turn the top the pump dispenser pops up out of it
this roller just didn't have any effect on my tired eyes
it had a cool feeling when applied
it made my under eyes so dry that it started to itch
takes a long time to dry
it takes a little time to dry
i feel like i paid a lot for the little tube of depuffing gel
i recommend putting it in the fridge
messy if even turns into little lumps i rather pay more for something i knoe will work
the 3 balls massage the skin much better than one ball would
i didn't like how sticky the gel is
i got it because it said that it can get rid of puffy eyes
especially after i stick it in the fridge
not bad i keep it in my fridge to help with puffy eyes
if i can get away with not having these white balls all over my face it looks great under makeup
i felt like my dry skin needed more moisture because i did notice some flaking halfway through the day
this somehow made it dry up
very dry in the winter
gets very oily in the summer
this was not moisturizing this was not hydrating i felt very terrible when i used this product unfortunately because it made my skin feel quite arid like a desert
i don't like putting such scented things on my face
unfortunately the new formula dried out my skin
bought this product because i have really dry skin when i get out of the shower it did not work for me as much i expected it to i have to apply on my face about 3 times to get rid of dry feeling on my face after my skins soaks it up
could feel the cream very heavy on my face
leaving it very oily
as to the reviews who say it is drying
you have to use the tiniest amount to get this to absorb into your skin
it wouldn't sink into my skin fully
the extra product would just dry up
i really don't like the fact that you must use a little spatula to apply the cream
then you have this little spatula lying around--where do you put it to keep it clean?
it doesn't fill up the whole bottle
shocked that something this pricey which is supposed to be for dry skin is so not hydrating
it's not even cold yet for my skin to be dry quite like this
after i apply it my skin actually feels tighter
it is really bad at pilling up even when allowed to dry
the $30 eye cream i usually buy is so much better
also a tip once it stops pumping you can manipulate it out of the bottle the cream is in a bag
there was no way to get the last bits of cream out of the packaging
not to mention the mess it makes on my bathroom counter
having a pump that leaks so bad it wastes a face wash that costs as much as this is mind blowing
was hoping this would help me hydrate as is freezing where i live right now
wouldn't recommend for oily skin.
off to make sureit it causes me the problem
it is not greasy
my skin gets too oily too fast with it
even then it takes a long time to absorb into your skin
find out the skin
however i found the day cream to be really heavy
it is so thick that i could hardly spread it on my face
i am 65 and have good but dry skin.
this cream did not reduce my fine lines
now i apply it only at night because it is a bit too oily
the smell bothers me so much that i had to wash my face to try to remove the cream
hydration about the same as another $35 cream i've used repeatedly from ole
spills everywhere especially in warm conditions
this is good for day time if you want something that lightly hydrates
i think if you were in a dry climate
is not treating skin because when you cleanse face the skin looks same like before
it is so strongly perfumed that i had to wash my face as soon as i tested it
it just isn't enough moisture for my dry canadian skin
it did not provide enough nourishment/moisture for my face
this product may temporarily make your skin smooth right after you put it on
no breakouts the only con i find about this which i why im going to look for another moisturizer is the smell good golly it has such a strong perfume scent that reminds me of axe deodorant it is so strong when i put it on my face i does not burn or anything
my eyes do water
it is so strong i feel like i can taste it gosh it really ruins the product for 150 bucks remove the perfume because it does have perfume in their because it list it on the ingreidents
i also agree with some of the other reviewers that the perfume is too strong for a facial cream that is supposed to make your skin feel fresh
i didn't even get a chance to test its hydrating qualities because it was so heavily scented that i had to immediately wash it off
stay away from this if you're at all sensitive to scent
as soon as you put it on you can feel it immediately moisturizing your skin
my dermatologist has always steered me away from any product with alcohol as it immediately dries the skin
'm assuming that this product doesn't work well with the oily areas of your face
it actually does hydrate your skin like crazy
make my skin oily after awhile
if you're skin is oily
it was not sticky
i don't even have terrible skin in that i get a pimple or two around that time of the month
i think my pores are a little too stubborn
if something promises pores will seem smaller
maybe cause i have t-zone and big pores?
even in the description it says it makes "pores seem smaller
made my face so dry
i do not have extremely large pores
this product does not maintain your skin oil-free
haven't worn makeup since this summer is horribly humid
cold plasma which did nothing
the only thing it did to my normal to dry skin was make it so oily i couldn't keep my make-up from sliding off
i used the whole bottle on my skin.
it was very drying.
i don't think people with oily skin will like it.
i do not want to smell sushi every time i put cleanser on my face
i found this serum to be very harsh for someone over 50
its a little like appying water to your face.
my face is still dry
i think any product you dip your fingers into will introduce bacteria
it seemed to make it more dry and flaky.
i felt just as dry as i did before i applied
not for severely dry
this dried out my face even more
this cream seemed to make me peel
i got rid of my dry patches within hours.
my skin is a mess
it dried out my skin particularily around my mouth which i never experience
it also can flake on you if you do not stop touching your face particularily above the eyebrows
more like applying really expensive water to your face
there are plenty of products that contain spf that don't smell like you're headed to the beach for the day
i stopped using this product because it made my normally clear skin greasy
the smell of the sunscreen is just too strong for me to wear consistently
its nice to have spf in it
i find that it is greasy
it doesn't seem to absorb into my skin
it wasn't heavy enough to be an eye cream.
3 weeks into the product it will cause dry patches
make the under eye area very sensitive if you forget to use it once
this balm is fine while you are using it
it also did not "de-puff" as it claims.
i feel like it doesn't hold moisture that well
did not sting if it got too close to my waterline or in my eyes
does not sink into the skin
i used for a few days to see if that's what was causing the dryness
i frequently wake up with the product still sitting on top of or "pilling" off of my skin
this eye cream does absolutely nothing for any of the skin concerns it claims to treat
if you don't have oily skin or sensitive eyes
cakey for sure everywhere this stuff is.
i could feel it "tighten" as it dried
could actually feel the skin tightening as the serum set
i also feel like it dried out the skin
no matter how careful i apply it i always get that pesky white residue
it doesn't help that i'm brown skinned so unfortunately there's no way to avoid it
it does not irritate my skin or eyes at all
the wetness from your foundation takes it right off
they got watery until i washed it off
some days i get this without the white layer others i dont
i don't use a creamy or greasy eye cream over it because it negates the effects for me
found the face tightener which looks just like this
this product would be awesome if it didn't dry with a white flaky residue
especially if your eyes tend to run
leaves a white residue no matter how little you use
it is almost impossible to get rid of the white residue it leaves behind
it does dry out your skin ecen if you only apply a little bit
at the expense of having all this flaky residue
my wrinkles aren't even that bad to begin with
if i wipe with water like they recommend then the effects disappear
for me it was either too much goop
alone its very sticky
it is actually sticking to my skin
if you get the slightest bit too much it turns white
t's useless to me since my bags come with dark circles that i need to cover too
it gets kind of "crumbly" if you rub the area or put on too much
difficult to use because of the white residue: when i blot it away
you don't smile or sweat all day
it's might work for some one with smaller pores
did needed something to minimize my pores for summer
it is my fault for thinking this because it just covers up the pores while you have it on
it didn't make my pores look smaller after using it for a while
though it does smooth them over
it promises to make pores seem less visible after just one use
as someone very familiar with using oil on the skin
it just feels like you are rubbing grease on your face
another downside is that it's very hard to spread onto your skin when applied
it's so sticky on the face it does not glide like other oils
just shows you how sticky and dense it is.
this stuff actually made my skin so dry that it turned that white dryness look in spots
i really feared it would break me out or make my face super makeup-resistant
the cleanser seems to miff me: it actually makes my face dry
i do not like the sticky factor
as it feels like i am stretching my skin to get it to cover
make sure your face is wet before you use it it's definitely not compatible with the clarisonic
i didn't like the way it left my face feeling after massaging water in either
the cons: it's too thick causing me to use more
sticky until you add a bunch of water to it
it was way too oily for my skin type
this one doesn't work for my very dry
don't accidentally get it in your mouth while washing your face
could not get past the texture
it is very thick and hard to apply.
which leads me to believe that it doesn't rinse off as completely as i'd like
may be a nice face wash
if you're not a fan of fragrances or smells in your skin care products then i would skip this one
it works great because the ptr wash can be quite drying
i got my fave clean without over drying
it's so hard to spread on your face.
to top it all off, it dried out my skin so much!
however no matter how much i massaged it never got easier to massage
but too thick of an oil for my liking.
the oil is really hard to spread on a dry face
it's like impossible to put it on dry skin because it is so thick
sticky that it like tugs on your skin if you attempt to rub it in
then you have to get just the right amount of water to make it slippery enough to actually use on your face
because if you don't get enough water then it gets even stickier
then if you use too much water
then you're basically washing it all away
so you end up using like at least 6 or more pumps to clean your face
i only like a cleansing oil because usually they get my eye makeup off the easiest
it wasn't an effective face wash for me
you'd expect a cleansing oil to have any oily consistency
this has a thick an sticky honey-like texture that makes just spreading it around your face feel like a chore
it's so thick that you end up being excessively rough on your skin
because you end up rubbing
it doesn't feel like a cleansing oil actually
very sticky and not good under make up.
i say that because i feel it seeps into my mouth throughout the day
i even tried to not apply it by my lips
i feel like this product never fully absorbs into my skin
oddly enough my skin didn't break out after using this product
leaves you wanting more in the moisture department
unfortunately i am pretty sure this started clogging my pores
the only reason i gave it a 3 star is because i have combination/oily skin along my t-zone
when i lick my lips after i eat or just in general
i would not buy this because on this taste which i haven't noticed on other lotions i've used
it made my face really oily throughout the day.
if your skin is more on the dry side
i started to get really oily
i miss their old product line which actually moisturized
don't apply anywhere near your eyes or mouth- it burns/tastes awful
if you live in an area with low humidity
it is just too thick to wear under my make up
it didn't really moisturize as much as i wanted it too
it would never absorb into my skin
didnt get rid of my dry patches
always have to wash my h
when i touch my face i feel the grease so
way too greasy, even with the slightest bit used.
ncredibly greasy that my skin was oily for hours after
this product doesn't absorb into my skin as much as i would like
it's nice for winter dry skin.
although it is very perfumey for a product you put on your face
by no means made the dryness go away
i could not even use the cream after i squeezed some out of a sample vacuum pouch because the smell was so strong
maybe because my skin is extra dry during the harsh winter months
at first i thought it was some eye products like eyeliners that caused this
i'd take results over a cute container any day
it just doesn't absorb
so if someone wants only moist this is for you.
i am naturally oily so for my morning routine this is a no go
even when it it almost absorbed into the skin if you rub your eye
the product is irritating if it actually gets into the eye
this stuff didn't do anything for dark circles or wrinkles or moisture or anything at all
it left no sense of moisture
i am a person with dry skin who loves everything moisture
what's the point of an eye cream if it'll make my eyes water
all this cream did was irritate my eyes.
not sticky nor does it leave a shine
it didn't do a lot to moisturize either
this one would be great for dry skin types as a daily moisturizer or for sensitive skin since none of the ingredients are likely to irritate you
it doesn't leave my oily skin greasy
i hope that it helps with the dry patches of skin i have
i do like the moisture
if you over apply it will flake off when you apply concealer or people with oily skin types may run into the flaking as well
it was ok to apply at night as long as i applied very gently
did not rub in
do not see the point of applying an eye cream if it is going to peel off
as an eye cream i did not care for it
does diffuse light which can trick me into thinking it works
the skin just as dry
i've noticed it drying my under eyes rather than hydrating them
it has done nothing for my dry skin or or bags.
this product just sits on your skin even when you gently pat it as directed
because otherwise i might as well just use my regular moisturizer
except that i can barely stomach the smell of it
at least it didn't irritate my skin the way some other eye products tend to do
the eye cream is adding a bit of moisture maybe
as a night eye cream that i can apply right before sleep so my eyes won't water
i figured any other effects would be icing on the cake
in my opinion it's just another harsh scrub
"peach scrub" that you can get for 3 bucks in smell
it does not appear to have any exfoliating properties at all nor does it foam
not just right after washing
when i wake up my skin does have a glow to it which is good
as you know, many serums tend to be pricey.
beware if you have sensitive skin
if your skin gets congested easily
it made my skin extremely oily causing me to break out more
maybe this would work for dryer skin types.
did not seem to sink well into the skin
unfortunately, in my case it stings when applied.
i couldn't stop my eyes from continuously watering
just seems greasy even when applied sparingly
it doesn't matter if i use a primer or one of my reliable "never budge" cream shadows
i wouldn't mind it in an eye cream suited for night time use
i actually had to wash it all off.
the cream is so thick that it doesn't absorb well
mix it with warm water before applying
if you like a rich thick cream you might like this
f your eye is irritated that day it tends to stink a little because of the spf
they must have changed the formula because the texture is more like a balm than a cream
however this eye cream was not even ok
applying it is almost impossible since is like an oily paste
it's a shame because i loved the texture-- i'd warm/melt a bit between my fingers
-didn't make me break out- lightened dark circles a little in the first week- did not sting whatsoever-felt very nourishing
didn't want to rub the skin under my eyes so much
only if you don't mind your eyes watering for the next 24 hours
after i would rub it into my skin
it will sting if it gets in your eyes.
tried this because i love the murad ultimate moisture face cream
as i personally think an eye cream should be thicker in consistency
this did provide all day moisture as it says
always had to unscrew the top to get to the face wash however that's not why i've given a low review
the product stayed on my skin as though i couldn't get it to entirely wash off my wash
no matter how much i rinse there is an oily feeling film on my skin
it can be oily
can also dry out on the surface very easily
however, it does have a nice lather.
i almost wanted to cry since i rarely ever splurge on face washes
it does a nice job in cleansing your face
i still think it's too stripping of moisture for someone who is 60+
it just removed too many needed oils
because of the heavy texture it's difficult to apply
i think if you have sensitive skin around the eye area
i found a $13 eye cream that i like much better
it didn't solve my quest for an eye cream that won't make the skin on my eyes burn
dark circles under your eyes is hereditary i don't think anything you buy is going to remove them except under eye concealer or going to a plastic surgeon
i wouldrecommend it to anyone with normal to oily skin
i unfortunately have dry skin at the moment
unfortunately i had to stop using this product it has olives which makes my skin break out
but i found my cold plasma face and love it
is very rich without being too thick or greasy
i wish i could say it totally removed my puffy bags
i tried this cream because i often "react" with excessive tearing from products around my eyes
if anything it only dried my skin out more
the product doesn't truly sink into your skin
00 is simply too much money for a basic cream that doesn't hydrate
i imagine this would work for normal to oily skin
us girls with dry/sensitive skin need a little something extra
it not only really dried out my skin
every time i put on this moisturizer my whole face turns red
each time i put it on my skin gets so red that it becomes unbearable because of the hotness
i don't see any difference in wrinkles ad my skin feels dry a few hours after application
my skin felt dry within minutes of application.
i didn't expect it to make my skin feel drier than before i started using it
i gave it 3 stars because it doesn't do much other than moisturize
this product is really doing nothing at all for my skin except drying it out
it felt like the product was being smeared around on my face when i put on the sunscreen
it just did not sink into my skin
i did not like the smell nor did it remove all of my waterproof mascara
some people said they couldn't wash off the cleaning oil by h
cant be washed away
rub it all over your face
you have to keep going back to the container to get more because spreading a balm over your makeup is as difficult as it sounds
it's generally kind of exhausting to put so much effort into removing your makeup when you could just swipe a cleansing cloth or micellar water over your face in under ten seconds
i used a towel to get rid of it
you're not supposed to rinse it off
i like the idea of using a damp cloth because wow i can see how much makeup it's removing
it made me wonder how much leftover makeup is on my face after a normal wash not using this stuff
felt like i couldn't get it all washed off my face
because this might be useful for older women with thin dry skin
i can barely use it to cover my face
after using it felt like there was a layer of grease just sitting on my skin like a film
stay away if you have oily
it does not rinse off at all
when i wet it the cleaner after rubbing my yes
they don't state that you should rinse off only
it is absolutely true that it doesn't strip your skin of oil
i prefer cleansers that don't require me to use a wash cloth to make sure that my face is entirely clean
it did very slightly lather
dirty on your skin afterwards
you have to rub it off with something
put it on my dry skin
before i could get rid of the residue
i don't typically use a washcloth or anything
the price + how greasy/oily a residue it leaves is why i'm giving it 3 stars
i even left it on for a while longer before using quick very hot wet cloth to remove this
i didn't use it on my eyes to get my mascara off because it smelled so weird that i was afraid it might burn my eyes
the product was so greasy
when i tried to wash it off- even with a cloth it would not come off
even then i felt like i had a layer of grease still on my face
it's making my t-zone area dry
even though it is greasy
it works kind of like a cold cream that doesn't come off
this is so oily
did nothing for my skin except dry it out from me having yo wash so much to get it off
more like oily mess!!
it didn't even heat up at all as the name "thermal balm" would suggest
i still couldn't get the oily film off my skin
i couldn't get past 1 wash
dry after using it
too drying for me.
this is sting-y if it gets in your eyes
would not reccomend for combination-dry skin types
it really did clean your skin
if it gets in your eyes beware it stings also be sure to go in with a toner after because it does not remove make up well
although i know to not get cleanser in my eyes
it is not necesary to wet your face first
it dried my skin so bad it even flake
so that means it is not completely absorbing into my skin
didn't provide my skin the moisture it needs.
i found that my skin got oily in half the amount of time it would normally take for my skin to get oily
i feel it provides enough moisture
its absolutely not greasy though
it got worse the more my temperature rises
i also wanted something i could wear overnight that would add some moisture to my skin which was still a bit dry from winter
actually made it drier
it was too drying for my skin
t sink into skin very well
didn't do much for my dryness.
does not feel greasy however it is a heavier cream
it does not sink in your skin
nor really moistrize either- still woke up peeling/dry skin on my face
but it does not fully absorb and feels sticky.
although this product really moisturized my skin i will not be using it anymore as white heads cause scarring for me
it just didn't improve my moisture level of my skin in the morning
during i sleep it gives an slight sticky textual which makes me not really comfortable in the night
anything with "moisture bound" in the title should not contain alcohol
i got this because my skin has been dry from the weather change
never dry until the cold weather comes in
once i started using this moisturizer i feel that it helped clear it up a bit
now do i wake up with "retextured" or "plump[er]" skin?
even though the tube says very dry to dry combination skin
does not sink in well.
it is not oily at all.
this was way too rich for my skin that it don't absorb well
this moisturizer managed to sting so bad in the area where i am most dry: my cheeks
all i find after a night's sleep is that my skin gets oily
which probably means it is too much for my combination oily skin
'm slowly coming to the conclusion that night cream in general is just too rich for my skin
got this because my foundation started to get really cakey
thought this one might help bring back some moisture without being too oily
don't use if you have oily skin!
i do like the cleanse i got from it on my skin
does leave behind a bit of a sticky residue
returned after one use because it is extremely perfumey
it's also difficult to get the water our of the bottle
it comes in one of those pump bottles that when you press down on it with a cotton ball it soaks it up
gets the job done decently if using a soaked cotton ball
i wanted something that didn't burn my eyes like the oil base because it would stay on my eye lids after washing off
the smell was too intense almost like i washed my lips with soap
it has a filmy finish that doesn't sit well with me
works well but i drys out my face really bad.
not so much on waterproof stuff
plus rubbing that area so much is not so pleasant
have to wash it a lot afterwards
the pump on this is also very messy
let it soak my eyes to get all of the make-up off longer than some other products
the smell is simply amazing however the product was almost like using highlighter under my eyes
i notice that it does de-puff my under eye a little upon application
you get a lot of product in a container!
just a normal eye cream doesn't really reduce my dark eye circle or de-puff it when i use it in the morning the only thing it does do is it moisturizer it during the day
there was a bit of shimmer in it that i didn't care for
found that the formula became really watery when left out in a humid environment
i'll admit i love how foamy this face wash gets
did not dry out my skin
i cannot even use this product twice a day some days because my skin gets so dry it flakes
feels like you are putting mayo on your face
it get's so dry that i literally feel like i'm pulling my skin
i also feel that it's too drying afterwards.
wouldn't recommend this for anyone with combination skin that leans more towards dry
i don't like the way my skin feels when i rinse it off
i found my face was so dry
even after i put toner on, it was still very dry.
didn't dry my skin out
if you don't enjoy that rubber feeling that some soaps give your skin
i gave it two stars because it did remove my mascara pretty well without having to rub too much
it made my face so dry
this cleanser seemed to leave some kind of layer on my face
it's a good pick for a middle-of-the-line winter cleanser
actually had drier skin
used this product for a month because i felt that my cleanser was getting a little drying
i still get fairly oily throughout the day yet feel as if i have dry skin in the night
a plus of this cleanser is you need the tiniest bit to get it to foam up
3 stars for not makeing my skin dry and flakey
then dries down to a film that doesn't do much
when i put a bit of toothpaste on my blemishes before bed it does the exact same thing
i apply it to any pimples that are on my face before going to bed
it did dry up my breakouts
would leave dark marks whenever i used it
all it does is dries out my skin.
it makes all the bad stuff come on the surface
i then had a scab for a good 2 weeks with dryness surrounding the area that would not go away
i do get an annoying pimple every couple weeks or so
it really hasn't done anything except dry out the area around the blemish
not only did it the sport remover not work
i normally do not have sensitive skin
it stops working completely it just drys the skin out
can't use before or after makeup as its so drying it makes the skin patchy
it doesn't remove blemishes as fast as i would've hoped
i could've done the same with just washing my face
it creates such bad dry patches if i use it too often
it really dried out my face
it didn't irritate my skin at all
it started to feel a bit oily on the top
skin that gets oily with the wrong one
it also takes forever to sink in so forget about wearing it in the am under makeup unless you have like an hour to wait for it to sink in
my face gets a little dry in the winter
i fnd my dry skin needs a bit more moisture
will also add that i have relatively dry skin in the winter
even mixing w/something less thick
too thick, so doesn't soak in.
i guess it's a good face wash if your face is super oily
this face wash was very drying for me
but it was also made my face look very oily.
this one was too greasy
i don't usually use night moisturizers because i have combination skin so sometimes when it's not that cold/dry i can get away without moisturizing
it goes on greasy
it feels very heavy with silicon like it doesn't sink into my skin
because it "sits" on top of the skin it makes me feel like my lotion can't sink in either
it's almost gel-like so when i put it on my face
my face is dry-combination type.
i find that right after i put it on it makes my face feel oily or greasy
does not leave me oily or shiny in the morning
this cream is way too thick
would have dry patches
at the moment i'm super dry because of winter
it was nothing some of my regular moisturizer couldn't fix
all it did was make my face so oily
does work on my dry patches which were my reason to purchase this
my skin would feel really greasy to the point that i felt like i needed to blot my face
i found that it would overnight significantly reduce a pimple or completely bring it to the surface
where i'm the most dry
even if i use it on my neck
it doesn't work with my oily complexion as i had increased breakouts while using it
it does seem a bit oily
tend to skip moisturizing my skin which has taken quite a toll on it
i started using it during the winter because of my dry skin
this would be great for anyone with dry skin
not great for oily or combination skin like my own
nearly every time i use this i get a new pimple
this didn't work for my extremely fair, dry skin.
although this takes off all my makeup it dries up my skin far too much
it cleans my face just like something else from the drug store
i think it does a good job of cleaning the skin
i found this to be a little too drying
it really burned and made my face very dry.
this face wash dried my skin out so badly
despite it saying it's good for dry skin
i've never had something this drying before.
too drying for my skin in the winter!
hard to use on your eyes as it really stings.
it made me realize that my skin works well with tea ingredients
took forever to rinse off if you used too much.
i do find it drying sometimes
it will work better for someone who has really clogged pores or oily skin?
ok for morning wash and those with dry skin.
at least not so good for my dry
what's worse is that if you have ever gotten it in your eye while washing your face it stings like no other cleanser i have encountered
i think this cleanser might be good if you have oily skin
it just doesn't have what i need to keep my pores clean
right now i use it as a body wash.
if you use too much it can be pretty drying
i only use this when my skin is oily
i felt like it was not cleansing enough
i get dry patches here
not dry or oily
what's really weird to be about this mask is that while it states that it clears pores
it made me more oily
it's also very hard to wash off
it wasn't that hard to wash off
it seemed like it barely cleaned out my pores at all
you will see a lot of spots on the dried mask which is oil/toxins being pulled out of your skin
although this mask does help somewhat smooth out my face skin after use
regardless of how long i leave it on my face or if i use a damp cloth to remove this mask
i've tried a multitude of different treatments to get rid of oil on my t-zone
each time i used it i was so oily so quick afterwards
i slathered on a very generous amount of this stuff on my nose
i've found it's really only good for drying out existing pimples
i am in the middle of trying to find a good charcoal mask for myself
i feel like my skin is now patchy with an oily t-zone
might work better for oily skin.
would work better for oily skin.
it doesnt burn my skin either.
didn't really do anything for me except draw my blackheads out the tiniest bit
didn't really make a difference in my pores.
i wouldn't go as far to say that it cleans pores because
i wanted it to do what clay masks are supposed to do- unclog the pores
is very hard to scrub off
there must be a perfume of dye in here not safe for sensitive skin because i have never had a reaction to eye cream like this product
if you're sensitive avoid!
cool at first then doesn't leave a greasy feel
it didn't work out for my sensitive skin
it actually made my under eyes even more dry than before
it was just sort of there, a gel on my skin.
i notice it kind of cakes or balls up
it is not greasy at all.
i get milia easy
it is heavy, does not absorb easily.
it is not greasy and i seem less puffy in the am.
i tried this because of my oily t-zone
it dried my face out really bad
it does foam up very well though just doesn't work for me
it dried my skin after i washed my face at night which caused my very oily skin to make even more oils over night
it was very drying
not dry like other products
sometimes i break out a little
it doesn't dry out my skin
i really thought this stuff would work good because i use origins black charcoal mask
this is a decent face wash
didn't help with my oily skin too much
it made my skin feel too dried out immediately after using it
during the summer my skin gets very oily
but it was too tight for me type dry.
it is way too foamy to use with it.
its ok it really dries out your face
it foams into a nice lather which is great if you are using a clarisonic
this stuff overly dried my skin to the point that my natural oils became out of control
this wash does not sop up oil as promised.
does not do a good job o cleaning or helping reduce oil production
then it made it more oily
it also did not "quench" my skin's thirst
if you're needing a quick burst of hydration
perhaps for a day or if you want to wear makeup without becoming dried out
it'll spread over your entire face
usually dry in winters
all it does it make the dry patches worse
for two days my t zone looked like an oil slick while still being super dry in other areas
the worse thing is that it doesn't help my skin to hydrate
my skin does not change at all in texture
i don't know deep down in my skin
i feel more likely the moisture stays on the surface of my skin
actually dried me out a little
it don't have any effect both for my dry or for my acne
i found that when i washed it off all the hydration seemed to wash off with it too
i couldn't continue using because i felt like it was clogging my skin
you're supposed to be able to pat it off with a tissue--ha
found that this product didn't really hydrate my skin any more than usual
which doesn't give me the feel of intense moisture
hydrating- you tell that it is absorbed into your skin if you look at the mirror when you put it on
soothing but not that effective for me
i didn't feel that my skin absorbed any moisture.
i normally have combination oily skin
i can still feel the dryness on my face
my skin was drier than before
if your skin is oily
even if your skin is super oily
my face actually looked wet.
however, this product is drying out my skin.
didn't really moisture but was nice under makeup.
not meant for people with really dry skin.
did not contain my oil.
this dried out my face more
also flaky dry in others
it didn't really do the trick for the dry skin
i'd stay away if you truly have oily skin.
some parts tend to get "tight" when they are dry
maybe it was just a bad product match for my skin in particular because other reviewers with oily skin seem to have had luck with it
this cakes up your make up
i absolutely hate the feeling of heavy oiliness making me feel like it's going to melt my skin off
it's definitely not going to be moisturising enough for cold weather climate in the winter
this just made my dry patches 10x worse
you know oily with some dry patches because my skin doesn't know what it wants to be
then i tried just using the zero oil astringent alone without having to apply lotion afterward
low for a product to save me from my oily mess
on the bright side, it doesn't dry out your skin.
very dry in others
would be nice to use in the summer as a light moisturizer or if you do not have very dry skin
i basically had an oil slick on my face
but using it daily caused my skin to dry out.
it didn't do anything for my clogged pores
doesn't dry like a mud mask so you just have to time it when you use it
it does not absorb into the skin--it's definitely just a mask
jawline which is where most acne comes from there is from stress if you don't normally get at me
use it multiple times on the spot treatment you can get some reynolds wrap
while it didn't get rid of my breakouts completely it definitely seemed to contain them a bit
all this mask did was dry out my skin
the mask does a pretty good job of getting rid of excess oil without drying out your face
it did make me much oilier than i normally am
did not work for me on a hydration level either because while my skin was producing extra oil
it couldn't stay moisturized on days where i needed make-up
get really oily in the t-zone
sensitive skin that can get dry or oily
maybe it can at least do something good to my larger pores oily t-zone
just be sure to apply evenly or it will dry black
just be sure u apply evenly and allow to dry
it's a good product for someone with oily skin.
i felt this didn't provide enough moister.
if your skin is normal
i really liked the tingling cooling effect it left on my skin after i applied it
this residue would come off of it
this black hydrating gel to see if it causes the same residue that it was left behind previously
i will probably only use this on a bare face day.
it made my skin literally slick thought the day
it comes in a package that when you press down to get the moisturizer
my skin didn't seem more plush even after twice daily use
this also made my face oily.
because it is not oily or wet
does not allow the powder to clump in the t-zone by the end of the day
the only thing it did was moisturize my eyes other then that it did not help with any anti aging
i think i'd go for a thicker eye cream next time
i also wouldn't recommend it if you have sensitive skin as my entire eye area broke out in tiny bumps after long term use
if you just need moisture for extremely sensitive skin
i prefer something thicker
even some dry patches when using it
i might try again in winter when my skin is more dry
its hard for me to squirt out the right amount.
i either squirt out too much or too little
my skin will not breath well
my face would feel sticky or like an oil slick
also give yourself about 5-10 min for the product to absorb before putting on a primer or foundation
i found that this doesn't absorb quickly at all on my dry skin
it hasn't really seemed to help my dryness either
it almost feels like you have grease on your face
in my dry areas it works really well
however i am only giving 3 stars because i don't really think this product helps to restore moisture to the skin
when you wash it off
i tried it and it was very drying.
i didn't like the fact that it made my face a bit oily throughout the day
perhaps my skin wasn't as dry as i thought?
i normally consider my skin to be very dry
however the overt amount of moisture/oils that this product provides lets me know that there is dryer skin than mine out there
i felt as though i had an extra layer of grease on my face
wanted something a bit heavier for winter
it has a really greasy formula that sits on top of your skin
it is difficult to get out of the container if you have long nails like myself
it is convenient it use under your eyes if you have dry under eyes
decided to try this for the added moisture
i know it should be thicker to cater to dry skin
unfortunately it was a waste for my rather sensitive my skin
the fce cream is just too heavy for me.
i also found it a little sticky after applying
i could actually see them getting less puffy.
you will not need a full "pump" as tiny bit spreads easily
i don't think i need a product to dry out my skin
all it did was completely dry out my eyelids
it did not irritate my skin at all
i prefer products that sink right into the skin
i found it really drying even in my oiliest parts
sometimes my skin would feel clammy instead of squeaky clean if used alone
not for dry to combination skin
it really does warm your skin when you put it on
the second i rinsed it out i felt how the product left my skin completely dry
you can't turn over the bottle to let it pour out because it's so thick
its odor is highly chemically which makes me ponder if i should put it on my face
i try not to inhale much when i put this on.
it's a nice cleanser that gets warm as you use it
this wash is nothing but garbage.
it just pretty much cleaned the surface of my skin
acne prone skin you might want something that'll penetrate deeper
it does its job at getting your face clean buuuut it doesn't help with pores or acne
then u have a nice cream that cleans good ur skin without drying it
that ends up with me either using too much of the black cleanser
maybe if your skin is mostly fine this is an okay cleanser
after i towel dry it my face just feels like it needs a lot of lotion
i think it's a product better suited to much older women or women with very dry skin
it wasn't sticky or to heavy
however does not provide enough moisture for my skin
it doesn't break out my sensitive skin
the only thing this did was give me some moisture
i prefer a rich cream for very dry skin so this wouldn't be my first choice
so you need to wear sunscreen during the day when you spend any time outdoors
it was not enough to keep me using it as it irritated my skin
i also don't like that it comes in a tub
i wouldn't recommend it for oily skin
not oily at all
this cream does not clog them at all
when its washed off your skin is dry again
i know eye cream doesn't work over night.
that area was very dry
dries up on the eye area, making matters worse!
it does absorb well
this did neither and actually dried my skin out.
what i like about the gel is that it absorbs right away
i find it a bit drying
she has skin that is on the dryer side
it just made my t zone very greasy
i occasionally get breakouts on the more oily parts of my face
this claims to be good for oily skin
it not only made me extremely oily
unless you have super dry skin.
i think this moisturizer would be better for someone with mostly combination skin instead of oily skin
pretty dry on the rest of my face
if they made this unscented i would buy it again for sure
i find it a little sticky as well.
it did not improve my skin's texture or moisture level in dry areas though it did an ok job at keeping the oiliness at bay
my t zone is still just at oily as before if not more
it has not provided much moisture for my skin
my skin has more dry areas than not
whenever i put this product on my tzone i get super shiny
this product doesn't do anything for my oily skin
it is not balancing my skin if anything it is making my nose dryer than it was before
it did not provide enough moisture for my combination-dry skin
oily for some reason
it just didn't suit my skin well at all
after an hour or so my skin gets so oily
a sales recommended this to me say it was good for oily skin
although it does make my face soft.
unfortunately it seems to provide some surface moisture
this product is for dry skin only.
this is too hard to warm up and apply.
it does not smooth on easily on your skin
the directions say to warm it in your h
stay away from this if you have sensitive skin.
thought it was just from the seasoning on the fish
i mean all my face was super shiny to the point that i had to clean my face with a damp washcloth to get rid of it
i can't imagine this being use by people with oily skin
better for someone with super dry skin.
f you have ridiculously oily skin be careful
i noticed that my skin always felt kind of dry after using it
it just leaves a sticky residue until i wash it off in the morning
i weekly do a peel to keep my skin nice
i also found it a little drying.
which means the jar doesn't last as long
this is great for dry skin or someone who isn't sensitive to shea
is annoying to try to get out of the tube to use
using a squeeze tube for this product seems silly as it is a rather unforgiving thick oil
'm not a fan of having to wipe it off with a towel as this cannot be rinsed
also was very difficult to rinse off in general.
doesn't do that great of a job cleaning the day off of your face
i don't like how there are no good way to keep the muslin cloth clean for every time you need to use it with this product
if you get the balm anywhere near your eyes
you have to be super careful not to transfer any of it to your eyes when wiping it off the rest of your face
i usually have very thirsty dry skin
it felt like i was putting something on my skin just filled with chemicals
the odd part is that it is not hydrating for me which si strange sicne it cintains hyaluronic acid which is a vehicle that delivers moisture deep into the skin
it does soak in nice.
there is a sticky feeling when it is applied
very messy does not soak into skin well
make them look greasy
doesn't dry out my skin
which is good because i don't want perfume on my skin
i got treatment but little moisture.
i literally had to wash my face 5 times to get the smell out
i couldn't top from gagging because the smell is right there under your nose
stay away unless you have a strong stomach
for normal / combo skin i need to almost put on two layers to get that moisturized feel
what on earth are they thinking with this "scent"
use it over the winter to see if it is better suited for my dry winter skin
i think that's better for my oily summer skin
seriously - it is not a cream.
it didn't absorb well into my skin at all
do not buy if you have oily skin.
made me more oily
too oily to use during the day.
i only use this product at night because it is a bit greasy
the texture when applying is very watery yet it makes your face look very oily
it was even difficult to wash off
sticky when i touch my face
can't get past the musty towel smell of this product which remains long after application
oily in the mean time
while it did do that it also clogged my pores really bad all over my face
my issue is that this face creme burns when i put it on
its quiete hydrating as well as its not to thick nor is it to greasy feeling
i returned this because the cream is just too thick
you get over the smell after a few uses though
a bit sticky after applying it
it's hard to get a small enough amount from the dispenser that it doesn't overwhelm my eyes
then it can be quite soothing.
someone with oilier skin could definitely use it though
rather a dewy look which is nice for those who have dry skin
it does not do anything for oil control on my oily nose
i feel like it just makes it more oily after too
i still have yet to find a miracle product that works on my large visible clogged pores no matter how much i exfoliate everyday
it didnt not really help my oily skin
it could be that my skin is too oily
your makeup doesn't look as good when you apply it over this product because your skin is dry
the tucson air is simply not helpful for keeping my poor skin under control
my face actually looks shiney after applying it!
this didn't seem to sit well under my foundation on dryer areas like my cheek
without drying out the dry parts of my face
i don't want a shiny/oily face!
i didn't get the matte effect when applied either
it's just a sticky treatment that sits on your face
i couldn't get past the tacky/sticky feeling it left on my skin
felt like the product did not absorb into skin
product did not make my combination skin oily
inevitably there is a fair amount of makeup on my cotton ball when i use toner after cleansing
there are much better cleansers out there that will get your face squeaky clean in one step
so this dried my face a lot
i don't even have oily skin
even though i live in hot
you have to blend a lot to get it to disappear into the skin
just don't get too close to your water line
you could use a cold spoon to do the same trick.
too drying for sure
which is what sr says your cleanser should not be making your skin feel like?
maybe just not suited for my skin.
be careful because if you get it too close to your eye it burns really bad
but i can say it goes or greasy and stays greasy.
it was a little cooling
this really burns my eyes when i apply it too close
i felt like this was drying to my eye area.
really isn't as it's 'recommended' that you keep the inner cap on so the product doesn't dry out so you essentially have two caps to remove
t dried up in a weird way
the tube is even made of this dense plastic which makes it feel like there's a lot of it in there
not really doing anything in the long run for my under eye puffiness
i do like the moisture it gives.
although clarins product usually breaks me out
maybe this product is better for normal or dry skin
too oily for other areas
my skin changed to not that oily
will find another moisturiser after empty this bottle because of dryness
i cannot use it in the summertime
i apply it to the dry areas of my face only
it was difficult to spread across my face unlike the heavier creams on the market for dry skins
this product did not eliminate the dry patches on my chin at all
i can even follow it with a chemical exfoliator to really get deep into action
my skin won't get red
t doesn't dry your skin out completely so when you remove it your skin is balanced unlike other clay masks
i do like:- you can actually have a conversation with another human being as it dries on your face
- doesn't dry out your face
it burned my skin so bad that my skin burned for days afterward
as if you can feel it cleaning out your pores
this cream does not irritate me.
i wasn't expecting this to foam up a great amount
how this is meant for oily skin
it can make my skin a bit oily which isn't even my main complaint
it wouldn't absorb into the skin at all
i should've done the normal/dry type
this might be a great product for someone with dry skin
although sometimes when its super hot
maybe if you have dry skin it could work??
oily gals you're going to look like a grease ball after a couple hours
however the oil is too heavy for my normal skin
however, this oil is horrible for my skin.
it looks like i have gone days without washing my face or putting any product on it whatsoever
this didn't absorb well
just made my face look oily
i tend towards dry skin
doesn't feel greasy later in the day
this facial oil is simply okay in my opinion.
in the winter very dry
in the summer very oily
this said it's a dry oil
i decided to try this oil for using as a facial massage base for my normal to slightly dry
just put some coconut oil in a pretty dropper bottle if you really need the aesthetics
formula its was way too thick
all i've heard if it's good pure 100%oil must absorbs to skin quickly
it is a okay oil.
my skin just wont soak it
- the bottle leaks so you effectively lose a week's worth of serum- the product remains on the surface even though i exfoliate my skin regularly
it's unlike many serums on the market right now that are very drying
i do like that my skin tingles when i put it on
i think this product would be appropriate for those with sensitive skin who only need light exfoliation
for some reason anytime i get a pimple it will leave a red spot for an incredibly long time
this product left me with dry patches
it is a myth that your skin purges before it gets better
it dried out my skin an incredible amount
dry patches for the first time in my life
it made my skin so soft that i used the whole bottle
doesn't foam up like i would prefer.
tight without being drying which is a plus
you must shake this before using otherwise it's more of a runny mess
i got more oily
i like to wash my face while in the shower
it is hard to do that when this is so easy to slip out between your fingers
it does not suds up
also love the frothy face wash from origins a lot more which is also like under 28 dollars
it cleaned okay but defiantly not for the price.
pros: it cleansit helps with oily skincons: does not help with ance at allcan dry out skinsmell is way too strongtoo expensive for the quality
there is almost no grime left on my face than if i where to use my old cleanser
it would probably be fine for oily skin
i live in a damp climate
this face wash is really just okay
water on your face
it didn't dry out my skin
t may be good for people with very dry skin
this made my skin feel really "clean" however it's not foamy or anything
then rinsed off could make a difference that is worth $45
so was overly eager to try this cleanser
it also doesn't smell very good once you rub it in on your face
i never felt like i was getting enough of the clay portion
when i rub it in a little too much it begins to flake off my skin
it's a bummer cause i normally use their regular yellow face lotion
i found that on the top of the pack it wrote "1 for very dry to dry skin type"
it is light weight does not leave you oily
i already have an oily skin
the "weak" scrub caused my face to break out something awful
especially in any kind of heat
you would just melt
i expected more of a "peel-off" kind of mask which was probably my mistake
even to someone with oily skin like me
you have to pat it into the skin
realised just how oily this thing is
which might not be a bad idea to use on the drier parts of you body
i can see it being great for parched skins
it's an oil but does gradually aborb.
it seemed to never absorb into my skin
i will use on days that i really need something for my eye that is puffy
does not leave any build-up or greasy feeling
around my mouth no matter how much moisturizer i put on
it also didn't make me break out or make my skin feel tight or dry
and it makes my face even more oily than before.
my t-zone would be very slick
my skin would immediately feel greasy after applying
i like that it sinks in
it only has 1% sacilyc acid in it which isn't strong enough for me
it doesn't cause peeling or any other problems for me
keeps my skin from getting oily again
at least not for greasy/dry skin.
all it did was make my skin dry
when you dry up your skin
recommend only using it during the summer because your makeup gets very oily during those times
when i use this product it really stings my face.
bought this because my skin has been dry
it actually dried out my skin!
it is difficult to squeeze the right amount out of the container
night that my skin would get a little dry though
it didn't provide any moisture
has a mattifying affect which doesn't keep my oil at bay throughout the day
it may be the salicylic acid that my skin isn't responding well to
my biggest issue with this is that it did not moisturize my face at all
it's too heavy for my oily skin in the middle of summer
it dried out my face really bad
the spout needs to be smaller so when you squeeze the product not a huge glob comes out
you waste too much product if you take advantage of the top's flat surface to rest the tube
it doesn't overly dry out the area like some are prone to do
my oily combo face was not helped :(
does't over dry the skin
it doesn't clear up the couple of zits i get a month
or even if i put a layer of it as in the directions over an affected area i would go to sleep with one pimple
i will just stick with my clean n' clear.
unless you take too long on rubbing it in
as your rub it into your face it starts to smell like feet
would be a good moisturizer if it wasn't for the feet smell
would not recommend buying for someone in their 20s with acne prone skin or those sensitive to smell
i also think it doesn't absorb as well as some of my preferred face lotions
it would start to peel my skin
this would happen right after i would wash them dry my face
i stopped using it because it wasn't moisturizing enough for my skin since i was
perhaps too much drying alcohol?
you have to slather on a lot of product for relief
this product did not soak into my skin well
made my skin itch as soon as i put it on my face.
does not leave skin greasy
might just be this brutally cold winter
bought it to use on my dry cheeks in the winter- i don't think i'd ever put it on my forehead/chin because it's very thick
my dry skin tends to be closer to normal in the summer months
found that it actually brought out the dryness in my skin
i can't imagine using this in the winter when my skin would really need the moisture boost
this cream is probably a better choice for someone with normal skin
to get a an extra bit of treatment
it wasn't really plump with moisture
it just felt like a wet diaper.
it didn't even give me a fresh glow
these feel good on your eyes
this mask is a good little mask for some time to relax
the acne clearing wash is about the only thing that is good
it did not dry my skin out even after i forget to apply a moisturizer
got this to try to get some clogged areas cleaned up
it contained products i normally use "aha's" to keep my skin looking good plus the salicylic acid which i normally don't use
it didn't even mattify my oil because i was so oily i could fry a burger on my face
they are just drying
this product made my skin break out like crazy it took me over a month to get my skin back to normal despite its claims that it has no oil something in it made me break out i have acne prone skin hormonal acne
doesn't provide enough moisture for me
very dry when i come out the shower
for something called "oil free" i still have an awfully oily forehead
this will only work while there is a lot of lotion in the bottle as the packaging is tough to squeeze
gives me maybe about 2 extra hours of being not as oily
it definitely didn't help my skin to become less oily
very greasy when first applied.
it does leave me greasy
it gave moisture, but too much.
it is not near matte enough
even with some extra time to soak into my skin
maybe in the hot weather it will work better,
not sure as this could be due to a new face lotion/weather changing
you do not get the sense that it is truly penetrating the skins layers to provide the anti-aging
it a actually felt very dry and sticky.
in fact, my skin feels drier afterward.
this dried out my skin very badly.
i can't place my finger on what the smell is
recommend not only using this if you have dry skin must moisturize after
with winter weather my skin has been dry
my usual moisturizer isn't cutting it in my arid winter
was hoping this will help moisturize the dry areas of my fast
it does get dry in my t-zone
i don't find it really hydrates that much more
my sin becomes a lot drier as i grow older
if you feel like your skin is dry
i think this is better for people who have combination oil to oily skin
i tried to use it on my hair many times
either way it made my hair very greasy each time right away
to the extent that i just wanted to rewash my hair
i didn't like how the scent didn't dissipate much after application
when i wake up for that extra moisture
i find to greasy for the day
it doesn't soak right in
it still wasn't perfect because i'm not sure why the bottle top is a mister/spray dispenser rather than any other type of dispensing system more suited to oil
spraying oil is really not a good idea because of the risk that you might breathe it in
it isn't a really good dry oil because it doesn't actually absorb well
i decided to test this oil out on my dry patches of skin on my elbows
was too much even for my dry hair
it will leave an oil stain on clothing if you are not careful
the overly "green" smell does not dissipate while you sleep so be prepared to wash your bedding in the morning if you don't like the smell
this oil is just too heavy for my hair
i still use it for my skin
it doesn't soak into my skin as well as josie maran's
it didn't really do anything for my red dehydrated skin
this expensive mask didnt really do anything for my dry skin
nice until the next day it was a constant use of the material to keep my skin feeling smooth
it just overly dries the areas already super dry
this mask makes do difference to my skin it doesn't hydrate it at all
but it didn't provide any lasting moisture.
for several days my face felt like it had been burned- even the most gentle moisturizer actually burned when i applied it
worse it actually dried out my skin
i found this to be a little too drying around my noise
it does get pretty oily throughout the day
it did make my skin a little too dry after continuous use
i didn't want to use any mattifying foundations in fear of my skin feeling like the sahara dessert
it seems like my oily skin will come back really fast by noon
what i don't like is that my skin feels dry after using it
am not as worried about the moisture
this was recommended to me as a good solution to my combo/oily skin that i was fighting over the summer
easy to wipe out all
it made my skin even more dry than it usually is.
instead it broke me out horribly bc it did not moisturize my skin at all
it it not greasy
which happens to be my most oily area
it also doesn't have spf
i don't like to feel like i have layers of product on my face
but does it keep you matte?
put the moisturizer on as soon as i did my face started to itch really bad
i would not recommend this to people with oily skin
i don't have dry skin at all
might be good for someone with oily skin that doesn't need a lot of extra moisture
have to deal with very cold winters
i found myself using way more of this stuff than i did my usual moisturizer
the kind that are under the skin from dirt or oils
be careful with this product because it is very thick
it really did not go well with my bb cream or bareminerals powder
my skin would start to burn when it was applied
then it just felt sticky
it doesn't absorb very easily
it's only wheat products that have ever bothered my skin
comes out tinted but doesn't cover anything.
if you're going to tint it
im really careful with eye cream when i apply it
i also did not like the hard applicator tip.
it is a little thicker than i would like
it was such a wet consistency
i am usually not good about sticking with a regimen
important: do not get this product too close to your lash line
it will get into your eyes
any cold metal object would do that
if you don't get clogged very easily
unfortunately this oil was too heavy for my skin
i can see someone with dry skin who doesn't mind heavy products liking this
did not absorb into my skin at all.
and i have dry skin.
my old one is a much thicker oil
your regular skin care regimen doesn't seem to be enough to battle the cold weather
if you already have oily skin i do not recommend this oil
so maybe my skin is just too oily for this
that it would melt right into my skin
hoping that this extremely greasy product
this made my skin develop bumps wherever i applied it
it made my skin oily and prone to break outs.
then dried out my problem areas to the point where i may have scarring
it is a lightweight oil that will leave a grease film on your skin not allowing it to breathe
the ferulic acid is supposed to also help with sun damage
well it made me break out with lots of small zits in my t zone after a week of use
it made me more oily then usual
i know it was not the serum because that stuff goes on matte
pretty much all the product spilled out in my skincare bad
it doesn't make my face greasy
basically like i said it didnt fade any spots or prevent breakouts
so watch out for this product if you also get acne-prone skin
i realize retinol can often force your skin to purge a little when first using
rendered the push-top applicator completely useless because there was not enough product in there to get 'pushed' out
it's just too thick to work with the pump.
honestly didn't like waking up to a powdery white substance all over my face
you won't wake up with all your blemishes magically gone
the thought is there for the packaging where you do not want to dip your grubby h
i find that the pump clogs quite a bit
also dry out my skin severely
i gave it 3 stars because when you apply a thin layer like the directions say to absorb oil
usually use it as a spot treatment unless my skin is really bad
people with oily skin might not have such a problem with this being drying
i wouldn't say my pores are smaller after i use the mask
in places where blackheads do not exist
my dry areas are still dry.
my already oily skin did not like this.
would definitely recommend trying a sample if you are sensitive or have acne prone skin
if you aren't into fragrance then avoid
found this to be irritating to my skin over time
this cream clogged my pores to the point where i had a full on reaction which is still trying to heal itself
i do know that i have oily skin
the good: it adds lots of moisture to my skin without the shiny look that some moisturizers leave behind
your basically paying for all of the unnecessary loads of ingredients that can harm the skin
this product could be a gift from heaven if you have dry to normal skin
i am 41 with combo skin on the dry side
didn't do anything for my brown spots.
if i do, i wear heat.
the only change i've noticed in my skin is whatever that's in the formula different is making my skin break out like crazy
i could've gotten the same effect smearing baby oil on my face for eighty dollars less
an oily consistency that i find unattractive
even if that were the case putting that acidic an ingredient on my face i don't think would make my skin very happy
it started to dry out my skins
i don't see changes on my skin color except it seem to start thinning my skin
i definitely felt a layer of something not quite sticky
this is far too drying for everyday use.
this is def not for someone with dry skin
i don't drink enough water
one thing i don't like about it is how it squirts out when you pump the bottle
i really don't recommend for dry skin to use it during winter
t's hard to tell if my skin was dull or just pale before starting to use this product
others it seems a bit oily/sticky
the tube is so small too for $38.
f you have very dry
maybe i'll like it better in summertime when the air sin't so drying
every single time i apply this no matter how small the amount or careful i am it ends up burning on the inner corners of my eyes
does not brighten instantly as it claims
my concealer did not even stay on nicely because my eye was tearing
the cream does not provide enough moisture for my undereye area
also be careful when you squeeze the tube.
i let it dry before applying
very drying and i did not see any brightening.
this cream did not absorb well
burns like crazy if you get it near your eye lids
might be best for dry or winter skin
if your skin is very dry or dehydrated this may not work you
didn't help with balancing my oil skin
if you don't have sensitive or acne-prone skin you might like this
the fact that it dispenses from a pump is great bc you avoid getting germs into the container every time you apply
even though it doesn't leave any residue
i would recommend for "normal" skin, not "dry".
i will admit that since i've been using the face moisturizer the desert-like dryness of my skin has diminished somewhat
i think this would be good for oily or summer skin
maybe i just need something heavier for the winter
it seems to soak up completely however if i pump a little too much by accident i think it's hard for my skin to absorb it
doesn't help dry skin at all
it's good to have something to put on your face after a shower
i still see dry patches right after i use this
it's definitely a good one to keep in your arsenal if you decide to wash your face midday
i didn't really get a huge payoff in terms of my skin feeling moisturized
after about ten min into it drying it made my skin feel really dry
i think it would work a lot better for normal to oily skin types
it doesn't soak in too well
it didn't help my dryness at all
this would be great for anyone with dry skin.
still needed a little more moisture
the pump is great so you aren't having to dip into a jar
bought this because in the winter i get really dry patches on my chin
i've found even on my normal skin it's better with a few drops of face oil
for normal, even dry skin this would be great!
didn't seem to be enough moisture for my skin
it is so sticky
it is almost too oily to even wear at night
even with dry skin
this product is supposed to be for dry skin
i don't feel like it delivers much moisture at all
its so difficult to find a moisturizer that wont break me out
i am only able to use this cream at night because it is so greasy
the jar does not open
it's not for oily or combination skin at all
it didn't feel like it got absorbed into my skin at all
it felt more like a greasy substance of film leftover on my face
i wouldn't recommend it for oily skin at all
my skin feels oily for quite sometime after application
would recommend it for those with very dry skin
this product was too heavy for my oily areas
i can tell this cream is only good for nighttime
it also didn't absorb well on my skin.
especially if you have oilier skin
it doesn't really absorb into skin
every time i use it my skin breaks out
that may be enough for those who have greasy skin that magnifies their pores
if your skin can tolerate physical exfoliation you may enjoy it
i didn't find this mask did anything for my skin besides provide some freshness upon its removal
made it oily as well after use :
you have to wash it off
it just hurt so so much that i had to wash it off
it doesn’t make my skin break out so that’s nice.
so much debris was in the sample that it couldn't even cover my whole face
i couldn't put in on my face unless i used water on my fingers first
it's basically just a regular charcoal type mud mask that other br
except it's got annoying dried leaves in it that make it difficult to spread onto the skin
i didn't have the burning
considering washing this stuff off feels like going at your skin with wet s
which isn't a pleasant small to have on your face
not bad that it's unbearable to have on unless maybe you have sensitive skin
it was hard to spread, but it did dry very well.
no matter how i washed my face afterward it was like there was a layer of s
the clay was not as easy to get out
dried out my eye area that i didn't like
did not absorb into the skin well
i prefer an eye cream that has a pump so that i'm not having to put an applicator that has touched my skin back in the bottle
it takes too long to dry even when i use a small amount
this pricey little item did nothing to improve my skin texture
it goes on very heavy/greasy
if i apply in the morning i feel like i have to put on some sort of foundation or powder to cut down the shine
as long as you let it dry for a minute
i did not have glowing skin nor did i find it very moisturizing
it gets dry in the winter
somewhat oily in the summer
i don't think it would once my skin turns dry in the winter
my face tends to be oily
skin care or make up
i am very particular with my creams as it can ruin or improve your makeup very quickly
wet look on my face
i can't say for sure if this is a result of the high heat temps i'm dealing with
i did not like the smell wither.
it does not provide enough moisture for my dry skin during the winter
you have to use a bit of it for the foamy affects
i will stick with lamer for my cleansing routine in the future
i felt it would be drying to someone with dry skin as it left my oily skin feeling parched
i guess it just was not the right formula for my sensitive oily skin
can leave skin a bit dry if you don't rinse really well
this probably is good for dry sking
it was a little difficult to get all the residue off
they suggest 3-4 pumps on dry skin to start
had plenty to wash my whole face
sunblock with my eye make up it really was not very useful to me
its disgusting to have it feel so oily even though its a "cleansing oil"
it is to use it on a dry face
i tend to prefer products without too much of a scent
it is just enough to give your skin the moisture it needs without leaving your skin feeling like you just washed it in a vat of oil
dry feeling it tends to get
it takes so long to absorb into the skin i can only use it as a night time cream
warm it up between your h
i did not enjoy the sticky feeling it left for a minute or so after being applied
my skin seemed to be more oily than usual after using this
feels slightly sticky until it does
i live in a desert climate where humidity hardly exists
wondering if this is supposed to be used like a serum under a cream?
not moisture enough for cold/dry winter
it protects my skin enough that i don't get wrinkles from the cold winter weather
my skin doesn't look dry
this product is too heavy for my skin type even in the winter months
don't waste your money doesn't work any better than the eye creams that are half the price
i did notice it does hydrate a decent amount
it does absorb into skin really well though.
it's also possible that i just don't see enough sunlight to get the "liquid red light" effects
didn't feel heavy or unpleasant as i've found most eye creams to feel
if you can get past the unpleasant sensation
i don't think it works any better than the "anthony-deep pore cleansing clay" which is also much
i'll just stick with my other masks that don't try to burn my face off
even though i make sure to seal the jar
these dried up chunks of product make it more difficult to apply
washing it off i had a flap of acne in the exact areas i put it on
perhaps drying on some people
clear up my pores it did not
the formula has chunks that feel like grass in it
taking wet dirt to put on my face
i wouldn't use it very often as it is very drying
i wanted to rub ice on them
there's hard chunks in the mix as well.
yes it will leave your skin soft
that this treatment will bring all that nasty junk to a surface
okay i got a sample of this because my skin is super dry over winter
when i say dry i mean like extremely rough texture
it's won't actually absorb into your face
unfortunately it did not work with my skin type which is dehydrated
i do like how it absorbs into my skin
it's not worth the 5 or 6 pimples i get the next day from using this
because of the face wash my skin became s dry
when i wake up in the morning my skin tends to feel very greasy
was of no help to my areas of dry skin
absorbs properly so that it looks good under my bb cream
made it feel tight when it dried
'll probably keep if for after peels or masks
is as dry as the sahara then you will love this
sensitive skin that breaks out when i put on something too rich/too nutritious
is not greasy after application
i figured if i fight the dryness it would clear up my face
i can only use this as part of my morning routine where i don't need a thicker cream for my make up routine
my face might need a bit more moisture than this provides
oily skin girls this one might work for you!
this was just too heavy for my oily t-zone
my still was still greasy after using this product
if you are slightly oily
i can say that it never irritated my powder application
it did keep me matte for 6-8 hours
i must have super oily skin where nothing i use works
do not wash in the morning because i tend to break out alot more when i wash in the morning
it did dry up the oil
it gave my skin that kind of shine it gets when its just been washed dry
water on his face does
still on the lookout for something to combat oily skin for my husb
it was non-greasy
was way too greasy to use regularly
seal in hydration" however it only felt like i had a greasy face
i only used it at night because it made my skin slightly greasy
no matte how much or little i used it was just oil sitting on my face it took forever to sink into my skin
doesn't stay greasy at all
i swear after awhile i was convinced i was just slathering straight up cooking oil on my face
we practice twice a day which wreaks havoc on your skin
i decided to use it on my normal skin
i find that i have a few dry spots
all it did was make me super oily/greasy
it did not absorb into my skin
it would leave oil on my pillow and my clothes.
in my opinion the oil is far too heavy for my skin
it also seemed to dry out my skin more than anything else
not sure if it tightens and firms skin.
while the picture shows that it for very dry to dry skin
i would wait to apply eye makeup until after it's sunken in because it may cause make up to slide
this is good for summer when skin is not dry
perhaps too well for my oily skin
this may work for you younger ladies or those without oily skin
i found this product to be way too thin for my liking
might be better for someone with very dry skin?
does not irritate my skin at all
it does take a while to sink into the skin
it just didnt sink in my skin like i wanted it too
this products a little too heavy for me
i just found it to sit on my skin too much
i just didn't like the thin layer that just wouldn't absorb
i feel like when i skip a day my skin is back to dry
mostly oily more than anything else
this product is not good for oily skin at all
i feel i lack a lot of moisture
other days it makes me an oily mess
you don't have to use a lot to completely moisturize your face
it works well on drier weeks because it moisturizes my oily skin without leaving it feeling greasy
the fact that it is good for combination/oily skin
i didnt feel like it absorbed into my skin correctly
there was absolutely no moisture
then i found that it left my skin sticky
so my skin needed a bit more moisture
this might work if you are in a warmer climate
i used this cream during the day because i don't think it is moisturized enough at night in california
then use this lotus cream again in the summer to see if it's better
don't soak in very well
they may not be good for under your eyes because they thin the skin out
the burning is so distracting i had to wash my face to try
it seems to be doing them exact opposite of curing my under eyes
in room temperature so don't know what went wrong
so besides the burning beware
very dry every time i tried to use it
it definitely goes deep so take care to avoid the lids or close to bottom lid as the cream will burn so bad
make sure that you wear extra sun screen when using this product
it slightly burns every time i try to use it
i found the eye cream to be really greasy
this cream does not work well with my skin at all
it makes my eyes water when applying it
it has kind of a sticky tacky residue that just sits there for a while
other than that this will irritate your skin bad
you can see there's no difference at all--i just have a couple of pretty shallow acne scars on my cheek
if anything, my pores are bigger.
even then it was still sticky
i feel it is a bit too sticky to use during the day under makeup
would not absorb into the skin at all
when i put sunscreen on over it immediately got into those little crumbs that get all over since the product never absorbed
it didn't even irritate my sensitive skin which dries out at the slightest change
you can noticeably see uneven patches of makeup where you applied the serum
rub it in a little more after you apply
if anyone can suggest a second moisturizer to layer over top that won't break the bank
sure enough my dry patches went away
my skin is normal sometimes oily but rarely dry.
perhaps i'll try again in the winter when its less humid
my crazy combo skin gets drier
it's really burn my skin so bad that i couldn't even put any other cream on
normally i have a clear , combination skin.
it also didn't help a ton with the pores on my nose which is something i was hoping for too
the fact that its just a nice smelling moisturizer in a fairly large jar does not justify the price
in the morning i'd usually have a bit of a weird residue on my skin
it moisturized without being heavy or making me more oily
simply does not provide enough moisture even for my combination-oily skin
let alone give my skin a smooth appearance nor smaller pores
the worst part of it is that it had the strangest pilling/balling up texture every time i applied it
once my face is rinsed i could see how dry my skin truly was
my skin didn't absorb it well.
i could feel it on my skin long after applying
which is a definite plus for me because i don't have time to wait for my moisturizer to absorb in the morning before i put my makeup on
only my super oily areas
it makes my face dry so at the moment just to use this all up i always combine it with my other cleanser
it is like when you use a wet paper towel to scrub something
if you are natural ingredients freak like me stay away
i like this because it absorbs so quick
i do feel pores are smaller now
which i usually stay away from as i have oily skin
second it's beyond drying more than just your average let's use some moisturizer on top serum
on the plus side, it didn't irritate my skin.
it was so drying!
just stating the fact to not be surprised if this product burns your skin
maybe something more moisturizing or something that will fill i the wrinkles to keep them from creasing even more
it makes my eye area burn slightly when i put it on
this product does nothing to keep the moisture in your under eye area which is so delicate
burned like the dickens and dried out my skin.
you have to use a brush or your h
doesn't absorb into my skin well enough
do not purchase if you don't have extremely dry under eyes because this will not absorb easily into your skin
i do love the non-sticky formula
i feel like it doesn't hydrate enough to be a real solution for my skin
all in all, this is an ok under-eye cream.
better to use at night rather than the day to help prevent oily skin on the eyes
did not irritate my skin
i notice that if i put too much on it will leave a white residue in my creases
it does take awhile for it to soak in the skin for me
it gives off a shiny/oily look when i first put it on
itching so bad i had to wash it off
since it does not absorb much into the skin
i don't ever feel like it soaks in
like i can feel it rub off on my fingers.
found this to be too greasy.
i've read how good argan oil is
i also don't like the fact it has coconut oil in the ingredients as that is probably the ingredient that broke me out
it never stings or burns when i put it on
i never liked using oils in my foundations before because they would make them runny
i really wanted to use it on my face because i have very dry flaky patches
it just never sinks into my skin
this product did not clog my pores or break me out
this cream oil just does not spread as easily as when i was in china
shortly after not being greasy anymore my skin felt dry again
instead it feels like neosporin with some oil mixed in
it was too oily it made me break out.
what comes out when i squeeze the tube is more oil than cream
while this is great post-peel or on a cold winter's day it doesn't hydrate the skin
so every time i use it a bunch of oil comes leaking out before the rest of the product does
the only thing it did was make my lips peel
it seemed like a good idea to use extra protection for cold
i found it very much greasy and too oily for me.
then i could feel the dryness coming back through it
maybe try her 100% pure argan oil instead
from the cold it might help
it does not absorb into my skin well
the packaging was so bad that the crème starts to dry our after 1 month
i noticed the cream makes my eyes really watery even when i try not to put it on too close to them
i guess it'd be great for someone with dry skin
this cream is not rich at all
this has woke me up out of deep sleep every night to rinse my eyes to diminish the burn
i am skeptical of any products that don't melt into the skin right away
it didn't absorb or remotely dry out way into the a
may just use it if i'm on vacation or taking a long bath because i didn't like that it was heavy
though my skin didn't feel that greasy when i woke up
there was definitely a greasy film on my face when i was washing up
t wasn't like my skin was in bad condition when i tried this product
then began to make my skin too too oily
did not work on my dry skin.
in fact when i wake up my skin is typically dry
it also didn't really seem to sink into my skin.
i would say this is definitely more like a mud mask than a clay mask
i loved applying it with the brush because it felt so luxurious
what i do like about it is that it comes with a brush to apply the mud
still it didn't absorb into my skin
the hydration didn't seem to lay all night unless i paired it with the boscia tsubaki beauty oil
it burns like crazy when applied
this product clogged my pores so bad that i couldn't get the breakout to go away for over 2 months
f you're someone who has pores that clog very easily stay far far far away from this
it seemed to be the perfect solution for my wintertime skin
the only use i could see for this is if your skin is in serious need of moisture
this products works really well on dry skin.
definitely didn't feel as greasy this time around
i would recommend this for all over dry skin
would prefer something with a little more moisture
i end up having to slather face oil on top to make up with it
i always feel the need to wash my h
it also requires that i use so much of it to have a moisturized feeling
it took a lot of product to get enough to cover my skin
soak right into my skin without too much trouble
as it wasn't too greasy when it was still cold
it got way too greasy
still is somehow sticky
this product did not absorb well into my skin
probably better for more oily skin or very humid climates
next time i need something with a little more moisture in it
not overly greasy/heavy on my already oily face
the way that is absorbed into my skin completely with no dry patches
because i love the super charge overnight moisture
it did not have enough moisture to it
it doesn't provide enough moisture to my face
it leaves my skin dry every time
i've never had a problem with other moisturizers leaving my skin feeling so dry before
slathering more of it onto my face didn't help at all
this might be good for someone with really oily skin
i am now terrified of putting any oils on my face even though oil therapy is supposed to work wonders for our skin
not for troubled or oily skin.
no matter how much i massaged
i really like it absorb instantly
otherwise when i splash water on my face
my skin still feels dry even though i used it the night before
i find that it is too greasy
i feel like i still have dry spots
then i realized it never lets any liquid or mineral foundation set
i found myself needing to reapply the product so that my skin don't flake due to dryness
i found use in it as a body oil for dry spots
you can either screw the lid on too tight
too much oil make my face greasy!
it won't break you out because it isn't mineral based
it feels very thick when you first apply it to your skin
it does seem to protect my skin from losing moisture to cold
flaky skin i get during the winter
there is nothing worse than that squeaky "clean"
much like you would with a bar of soap
i loved the way it really saturated my skin with moisture
really does nothing for really dry skin
i returned it the same day i got it because not only was it not hydrating for my dry skin
definitely does not absorb into your skin well
towards the end of the bottle i felt like it wasn't really moisturizing my face like it once did
this product is way too sticky
although it has a nice smell it really didn't do much for my dry skin
i didn't have any flakes on my skin
there is an oil overload on my skin
this one just had way too much moisture
which tend to dry out my skin
every time i put it on it makes my skin itch like crazy
i didn't find it great on dry skin -- i needed to use a fair bit of product
it leaves a sticky film that never really seems to go away
i find it odd that my cheeks got really sticky after using this gel cream
as if my cheeks somehow just doesn't absorb it
however for my dry skin, it does nothing.
oily t zone in my 40s so maybe just me
i would recommend only using this at nighttime unless you have super absorbent face skin
i don't recommend this product to people who have oily or combination skin
more oil was found on my skin which isn't usual
i think because it is partially a gel
i don't have dry skin
my skin gets very dry in the winter to the point of flakiness
this would probably be enough moisture in the summer
i just feel like my skin is not clean after i use it
one pump is enough for your whole face.
the smell i thought i would feel the same way about the cleansing foam
it does take more than 1 pump to cleanse your face
my skin was super dry at some places
may work if you have more oily skin
doesn't clean so well
i barely have enough foam with one pump to cleanse my face
i will definitely be going back to the soy cleanser when the foam runs out
i don't know what they put in this cleansing foam
not feasible even to wear at night as this is fairly absorbent oil
there are other oils out there don't waste your time with this
honestly i haven't applied it enough times to say how well it works on my skin because i actually have to put an old shirt on my pillow at night because of the orange color it leaves on my face after applying it
you need to put it on at night because the orange colour slightly transfers to your skin
it 'stains' my face when i use it without a lot of time to massage it in
it feels like none of it is absorbed into my skin
even though it turns your face orange when you first apply it
rough texture--this oil wasn't enough to solve my issues
it doesn't feel thick when you dispense it
i actually have very dry skin
if anything it made it more oily during the day
though it does not stain your face
if you've ever taken fish oil supplements- that's the exact smell
i didn't notice any depuffing or cool feeling effect which i expect from an eye cream
it's too sticky to absorb and too oil.
it did not provide enough moisture
unless you don't mind the greasy texture
i don't have oily skin.
i don't find it absorbing quickly.
i cannot use rest of the bottle for my eyes.
i think i would like this eye cream for the hot summer months
the product i find that gives me the moisture
it did nothing except hydrate my under eye area
would only recommend it to someone with extremely dry skin
just didn't absorb well
this eye cream is really oily too
doesn't absorb well at all
however if you have combination skin with dry spots you will need another moisturizer
if you stop using it the effects wash away immediately
absorbs into your skin quickly so you don't feel like you're wearing anything on your skin
not greasy at all.
unfortunately i did not think it was as good as the daily glow pads
does not moisture enough ...
however, it did not tan my skin at all.
i couldn't even see if the color worked or not because i had to rinse it off after about 10 minutes- the smell of the product was so bad
i washed it off because i don't want to risk waking up orange
so hopefully my face won't be oddly discolored
bothered me so much that i had to remove it with my cleanser
the smell was soooo bad i had to immediately rinse my face off
i don't know about the glow effect because of my rinsing off
the product is exposed to air every time you use it
it did make my eyes water
i find it not hydrating enough as compared to other br
the moisturizer absorbed quickly did not leave my skin feeling oily or any type of negative way
living in a drier state makes this a no go for me
it's not greasy or sticky when you apply it which is really nice
i do not usually use a facial cream in my morning routine
a bit sticky as well
giving it only 3 stars because i need to prevent aging of my skin
it just isn't enough for how dry my skin is
it doesn't give enough moisture
since the texture of it is so slippery it made my foundation move all over the place
so not only do i not think this smoothes out large pores anything like other reviewers have mentioned
it didn't give as matte a finish as i like
doesn't keep shine at bay for very long
i did feel like my makeup was a little thicker after putting it on
this product made so oily after a few hours or wearing which in turn made my pores look worse
i normally don't have issues with oil
have taken to avoiding putting it around my mouth because it tastes horrible
with the humid weather this primer did nothing to keep me shine free
i love the consistency of this primer unfortunately it made my skin itch
i don't go out in the snow unless i have to
often giving out when there's still a fair amount of serum in the bottle
that latter fact also annoys because it means you can't scrounge around for the remaining serum once there's too little to travel up the pump
my skin was getting extremely oily out of nowhere
it is too drying for use twice a day
i tried it once and it is extremely greasy.
i followed it with the matching cream- not enough moisture
stay away if you're oily and acne prone.
it does more damage to your skin than food for your senses
it doesn't sink in particularly quickly
didn't make my face oily at all
my face gets very oily when i wear this whereas it never used to
to start off, i have very dry skin.
my face would be super oily
as soon as it gets on the skin it changes into an almost moldy smell
a lot of people say this melts right into their skin
anything that burns should not got on my skin
notice my face just doesn't feel moisturized a few minutes after i put it on
it feels dry like a very light daytime cream
i went on vacation where my skin was not used to the dry climate
thinking it would help with the dry skin on my chin
i don't have dry skin
i need something heavier for my night cream
i applied the mask again the next night without applying any of my harsh acne products in order to avoid extra dryness
i figured it was something your skin had to adjust to like retinol
this could potentially work for someone with dry skin
or someone living in a less humid or cooler climate
after using it for a while i found it didn't work well on my acne prone skin which is says its supposed to
my skin is clearing up now which i can attri
this oily does not get absorbed quickly
unfortunately this did absolutely nothing for my oily skin
when i put it on i still needed to use a moisturizer because my skin felt very dry
this did nothing for my oily skin
my face is still oily
it did not seem to control any of the oiliness
i put a pinch on my skin, which is normal-dry.
although it does leave your skin soft
cons: it made my already oily t-zone
did not absorb well into my skin
other than it was more oily
it was so awful that i had to scrub
this was the first face oil i have heard that is just for combination/oily skin
this product makes your face shiny as it doesnt really sink in all the way
the smell is so off-putting i can't bear reordering it
it made my face so greasy that my friend asked me why i was sweating so much
the shine is so out of control that i look like i'm sweating
if i end up moving some place very dry or with cold
i can compensate for the ashy look with foundation though
it the beginning i thought this stickiness will absorb into my skin
for someone with dry skin, this may be great!
the only moisturizer i have ever been able to use that hasn't broken out my skin was perricone skin clear hydrator
it left me very oily/shiny
i also live in a hot/ moderately humid city.
you start perspiring the moment you leave the ac
this is a little bit dry when i put it on my skin
is quite dry so there is no oily feeling on your face
it didn't grease me out like this did
it does not help with oiliness
this is no match for my oily skin.
this is probably good for dry skin
not someone who has somewhat oily skin
in fact it dried out my skin.
even out my skin a little
found that it did not do much besides hydrate my skin
it doesn't make my skin feel quenched
i only break out if s product is irritating.
in the meantime it did make my skin baby soft
that it would even out my skin texture as promised
it may be a holy grail for women with dry skin
definitely avoid if you are oily
it does seem to tighten skin
basically as soon as i apply the product my skin feels quite soft
i got a few extra blackheads in comparison to what i normally get
if i just needed moisture then this worked well
can't even blame this on harsh weather wearing the plastic down
this moisturizes as well as anything else out there
it was a bit heavy for the summer transition for my oily skin
the roller hardly allows any oil to come out
much like i have for other oils
combination / prone to breakouts with some products / slightly sensitive / dry at times to oily at times
even then the cleanser is pricey for what you get/results
almost like i had a thin layer or something on my face
strongly urge trying a sample of this mask before purchasing if you haven't used any products with ferments before
i do not have dry skin
this did not irritate/tingle/cause any sort of sensation while it was on
it didn't burn my eyes
i think there are better products out there for resurfacing skin such as the first aid beauty radiance pads that are way less money
can definitely be left on my sensitive skin overnight
it didn't seem to make my skin glow or do anything significant once i cleared off the mask
it dried really tight which i hate
does not not feel greasy at all when applied
unfortunately won't be purchasing the full size because of the smell even though the moisturizer works well
does nothing for my dry skin
i would only recommend it to someone that has oily skin
i find it's just not moisturizing enough for my skin right now using the directed amount
it could also be from my skin not being moisturized enough with this
it didn't feel like it fully absorbed into my skin
i just couldn't take how greasy my skin felt
it is not for dry skin.
i think if you live in a humid climate it would be quite nice
if you live in a dry climate or are dealing with harsh winters definitely don't get this
it just won't protect your skin from even moderately harsh conditions
that can happens because of too much sun
oily like if i was sweating
my skin is combination with more of a tendency to get dry
normal-dry everywhere else
i will say it scrubbed away the breakouts i could see forming
instead it was dry
not easy when you are trying to wash your face
my nose still felt oilier than the rest of my face after each wash
this cleanser didn't cause me any trouble.
i don't use it as an everyday cleanser more like twice a week or when my face feels it needs a little extra
it seems like the product is to thick for this pump
i highly dislike that you have to use it on dry skin
the little grains on dry skin just dont seem to be something that could be used "daily"
pump to get enough product for a single wash
doesn't dry it out
it leaks when you travel with it
it does not really add anything to my skin- doesn't moisturizer or reduce lines or even tone
began to think maybe the serum is too thick
it actually makes my eyes burn!
it didn't moisturize at all in fact the dry areas on my face started flaking almost immediately
it was more like dousing my face in stale
it's like putting water on your face.
drink as much water as you can st
had too much to drink
it feels cool while applying
however it made my eye skin really drying
found it to be very drying
returned it as i really need something soothing
the only reason i chose to use it was because it didn't cause the fat particles under eyes
cold water does the same thing.
if you're looking to lose your puffiness
the one good point is that it never irradiated my eyes
especially not someone with sensitive or dry skin
unless you just want a cooling sensation
didn't help with dry skin at all
my skin rarely breaks out
the only problem is how dry my face is after washing it off
also, this stuff will burn your eyes badly!
doesn't feel as satisfying as their other face wash i love so much
this product totally dried my skin out
even in my oily areas
even if you have oily or combination skin!
my skin has gone from normal to oily
bc i have oily skin its pretty hard to find the best one that can control shine
if i use even a little bit too much it feels like i have glue on my face
left my oily skin feeling like i needed something a bit heavier
it is probably great if you have oily skin.
it seemed to make my skin look even drier
in this cold dry winter it was useless for me
could immediately tell my face was greasy
yet not doing much for my skin except causing breakouts
it did absorb fairly quick
i think it was also too much moisture for my oily skin
my dry skin felt even drier with this oil.
just use this one to make sure it's the oil my skin is reacting to
its too oily or there must be some ingredients in there my skin is reacting to
it does absorb it quite quickly
it might not be suitable for oily skin.
it had my entire face peeling which i know is normal
i think the dryness is a little better.
not for oily skin at all.
i only use this when my skin feels dry
i can get away with not putting on moisturizer after this
i find this product very drying.
it just sit on the skin
even out my skin tone like a good primer would do
i did not find it to be drying
sort of dry consistency that feels like it does not absorb into the layers of the skin
i didn't have any bumps or texture
i think this is best for someone who has oily skin
then it was oily
if you use too much it makes your pores look huge
another negative is it does leave this shiny film on your face that makes you look greasy
me having oily skin already doesn't look good with wear throughout the day
my skin did not necessarily feel softer or more hydrated either
i do not have very dry skin so it is a bit odd.
i did not like this face cream it was to thick
felt kind of like i put to much sunscreen on my face
my skin is not flaky or oily anymore
though it says oil free
it just felt too heavy
the cream itself is very heavy feeling so too much feels like it's clogging my pores
felt like it didn't absorb into skin.
i think it works well in more humid places
since the weather is more dry here
felt even more dry
crinkly than they were to begin with which i wouldn't think possible with an eye cream
i felt i needed to use a lot of product for it to feel like it was actually moisturizing
it's a thick consistency i feel i have to keep on rubbing the cream on before it really sinks in or else it just feels like it's sitting on my skin
just ok makes skin feel clean does not help acne
this face wash is great for those with oily skin
not those with combo or dry skin
if you do it in the shower then it gets into your skin much better
i occasionally break out unless i stay on top of my acne skin care routine
this hasn't helped because it dried my skin
this one just doesn't rinse off the same way
it does tend to clog my clarisonic
it also burns if you get it in your eyes
i give this a try because this is for oily skin
it made my face dry
this did soak in pretty good
still had a bit of an oily feel definitely would only use before bed
i used this after regular argan oil made me break out in disgustingly large acne
it just made me oily
buy it and try it if you have oily skin.
if it doesn't work out for you at least you can still use it on your cuticles
this one would probably be better for someone with oily skin
somehow still very greasy on my face
i've tried oil cleansing also with no luck.
after a week or so of use my face dries out horribly
the dropper constantly 'drops' even when you don't squeeze it
people with oily skin will appreciate this
for me in particular it was a little bit too drying
not for really dry skinprobably ok in a hot humid summer day
it's a little thick, but it does rub in.
it doesn't even clean the end of day oils off my skin let alone makeup
literally a cheap toner does a better job of removing dirt than this
i still have to go in with a make up remover wipe after letting this sit in my face for a bit
it depends if i can find another makeup remover that isn't full of chemicals especially ones that burn
tap water does a better job
it feels kind of sticky while drying
feels like regular water
face feeling so sticky i had to rewash
the back of the bottle says you're not supposed to rinse
i definitely needed to rub the bad numerous times to get my eye makeup off
no refreshing feeling that i get from most micellar waters
it felt like i had soap on my face that hadn't been rinsed off
this one doesn't feel oily at all
the only things it could not get off were my eye liner or mascara
i think this would be better if it was treated just as a cleaning toner
when i use it i see little to no residue on the cotton pad
can't tell if it is cleaning my skin
in fact, my skin is sticky after use.
i got this because i get water everywhere when i wash my face in the sink
so alas, it has come down to being my toner.
they burned and watered like crazy.
if you are using this for moisture boost then it's okay for you
i don't think is should be used in place of your cleanser because you can't possibly wipe away all your impurities
i'd rather have a cleanser with water carry away the dirt off my face
i could have loved this micellar water if it didn't leave a sticky residue behind on my face
i wasn't a huge fan of this product at first then after i used it a couple times i noticed some mildew like particles floating around in it
when i used this product in the store it felt like it really cleansed my face
five cotton pads wasn't enough to remove it.
i usually wear the make-up forever cream liner
hates sleeping in it i found that this does not even remove the slightest of mascara
it make my face feel oily and dry.
it seems more like a scrub than a mask to me
go get some real honey
unfortunately it leaves me with dry patches for some reason
naturally i used her stuff as well
not enough moisture for me and i found it greasy.
don't get this unless your skin is extremely dry
beware because it'll make you look oily
it does not soak into my skin.
i love this stuff in the winter because it gets rid of any dryness
sure it will get rid of dryness
flaky yet the rest of my face got so oily
all it did was heavily emphasize my dry patches
doesn't feel like it's being absorbed into my skin
at the same time it sat on my skin making it seem oily
over time i realized it didn't seem to actually penetrate the surface
the smell is so overwhelmingly chemical/rubbery that i will probably just end up throwing it away
it made my whole face super dry
in less than 24 hours i had a dry flakey patch of skin
it didn't leave my skin oily
tried this out because it said it was great for dry skin
this lotion did not sink into my face
this leaves my skin so oily after i use it.
i usually still finish my routine off with a beauty oil to help it out
gives me trouble when my skin is dry
it did not absorb into my skin
can sometimes feel heavy
my skin got so greasy during the day
i could wipe the grease off it was the most disgusting feeling i have ever felt
it unfortunately didn't relieve my dry spots.
will probably have to use something else for my drier areas
on its own i find i have to use a ton of it to get my dry areas hydrated
when i use it alone it takes quite a while to sink in
my skin can be pretty parched
it doesn't sink in really fast
greasy even for that
in about 3 hours my face felt oily in places i have never felt oily before
couldn't figure out why i was getting acne around my eye area
i think it actually caused under my eye to become more dry
i don't feel that it is moisturizing nor does it correct my under eye lines
does not create breakouts if you spread it close to your cheek/nose area
i did notice that it can feel slightly sticky even if lighlty applied
it may just be that it doesn't have enough moisturizers in it?
not for dry skin.
this just wasn't enough moisture for me
i found that this does not give me enough moisture
even with plain water
then gets very oily
it definitely dried my face out
the milky formula is very nice however this left me really greasy all day
it did not do as claimed in evening out my skin tone or reducing pores
it is to add on to your facial routine especially in the winter when dry or peeling occurs
bought this one thinking it would a nice light non greasy formulation
it's just felt like a regular face lotion that did nothing harmless or beneficial to my face
so be careful if you have sensitive skin.
it can feel heavy
i almost feel like it increases my oily-ness over the course of the night vs if i hadn't used the moisturizer
i didn't feel my skin absorb the product.
made my face burn.
it never felt thick enough.
i can imagine for people with less than oily skin
not oily on me at all
second, it made my face even more oily.
that would really help my skin from the problems this moisturizer says it will fix
after a week or so of use it started irritating my skin
definitely do not recommend if you have dry/combination or sensitive skin
i also feel as though the moisture doesn't sink in deep enough
i didn't like how this product felt sticky
it doesn't sting or burn my face at all
acne prone with dark spots so maybe it isn't as sensitive as others?
but it doesn't burn!
it left a weird residue i felt never properly absorbed into my skin
it does leave a sticky film on my face
not only did it burn immediately the burn would last until i washed with water
these make my skin sting like the absolute devil until the solution evaporates
these did not dry out my sensitive/combination skin
a little does go a long way as it is so foamy
it does not leave my face feeling any more hydrated or calmed than to began with
jelly-like consistency that just seems to sit on the skin without absorbing
if you sleep on your stomach
be prepared for your pillowcase to just stick to your face after you put this on
i must not have dry enough skin
because i found this to be very sticky
it is very sticky when first applied
so that i wouldn't get gobs of cleanser on the clean wet cloth
not even under full-hot running water
i suspect any cleanser with a hot face cloth is going to feel good
blast it under the hot running water just to get the cloth feeling clean enough to continue with
the main ingredients are actually pretty bad for your skin
i feel you could easily get the same results with a homemade mask using sugar
oil scrub you could whip up at home
i don't feel like this cleaned my skin at all.
it did not dry out my rather dry skin.
it would be like i rinsed my face with just water
so does cold cream- with a much better experience
i found out that this has a lot of mineral oil in it
i do think that the price tag is a lot to shell out for a nice-smelling makeup remover
more on the dry side so wanted to try something that wouldn't further dry out my skin
while it did not dry my skin out
i wish i had purchased the moisture mask instead
i wonder if some who feel too dried out overapplied
the most important thing is it dries out my skin
it was so very dry and hard to apply.
it might rescue oily skin with break outs.
for my dry skin, it is a disaster.
the only positive thing i will say is the cleanser does leave the skin soft
i don't know why they had to heavily scent this cleanser
i tried to wash my face with this stuff
it didn't irritate it at all while still getting any residual makeup off
i totally changed my mind after i used this product which is so oily
i feel my skin cannot breath
this feels like its leaving a waxy build up in your skin no matter how you try to rinse it off
it doesn't dry up your skin :
it seems to leave a film that's slightly oily in your face
it does not lather
i prefer to pat dry
however if you have dry or combination skin
leaves a film behind on my skin that i don't like
from the reviews i thought it would be foamy
the day cream didn't really upset my skin until i added the serum
i noticed with both these products my skin is dried out
i would not use this serum if you have delicate skin that isn't damaged from smoking or sun
though i still have some flaky patches that arise after washing my face
you're actually flushing a lot of your money down the garbage can
more like a face cream to me, too thick.
overall i like a serum to soak into my skin not feel like its laying on my skin
they still continued to get drier
i guess it was just damaging my skin
it just made my eye bags super dry
also very dry compared to the rest of my face which is oily
it caused the very very top layer of the skin to be completely dry
i assume its going to flake off at some point
it was very drying
i found it didn't absorb well
because i didn't keep using it because the texture turned me off
the supergoop eye cream does take a bit of time to blend out as it's quite elastic
does not immediately sink into the skin
one that i think is worth the sun protection
you'll need to dab it in for a few minutes with your fingers
i feel great knowing my undereyes are protected from the sun
also enjoy the smoothing effects even though it does take a few minutes to blend in the morning
my eyes feel like a desert when i wear just this.
the white grease of this product just stay on my eye area for the whole day
too much made my eyes burn.
i can't wear it when my eyes are going to water from allergies or if sweating because it burned my eyes
this eye cream didn't work for me
if it didn't flake off
'll see if it's usable in the summer when my skin isn't quite as dry
it didn't absorb well.
a complete waste of money did nothing for spots or texture of skin
it didn't really do much to the dark spots i have as a result of sun damage
i try a lot of skin care products
sleeping in my makeup doesn't even break me out
either they did something shady back there or a $98 beauty product only lasts two weeks
a pretty expensive moisturizer is what it ended up being for me
it was the result of the type of moisturizer i put on afterwards
purchased shade 2 maybe i should give shade 3 a try
which is weird cause i don't have sensitive skin by any means
the night cream is a bit much for my combination-dry skin
the night cream may work really well for you if you tolerate the retinol in it
because i can feel how dry
this is not a cream this actually foams when it comes in contact with water the consistency reminds me if shaving cream it's hard
even using this small amount it was to foamy for me
i found it to be too oily
however it tends to dry my skin out.
while it had a good lather
i guess it's for a drier skin than mine
my drier areas need to be clean
if you're moderately dry or just need an occasional boost of moisture
this didn't dry me out
doesn't seem to do much unless used after waxing or epilating
t's very dry here all the time
especially now since there is very little rain in california
i can see this being good after a sunburn or wax
i try alot of products without ever having skin irritation
cons: it didn't really do anything to even my skin tone or get rid of redness
i usually use this after other masks that can leave my skin with that tight feeling or if i have some dry spots due to acne products
didn't make my skin worse though.
this mask do nothing on my skin
perhaps my skin is not dry
i'd even say my skin is slightly on the dry side
cool on my face when i applied it
to be honest it doesn't feel any different from cucumber aloe gel you apply after being in the sun
immediately after washing off it does nothing
i like to use it after exfoliation or if i've had a little too much sun
this did feel cooling on the skin
it did nothing as far as hydration
gross products however this cleanser does nothing for me other than smear make-up around
really upset to the foaming cleanser is no longer available in the us
keep away from your eyes, the packaging says.
so this cleanser is leaving certain areas of my face too dry for my taste
made my face feels dirty n gross that i had to go in with another cleanser
this didn't really do anything for me as far as making my dry skin feel more moisturized
you definitely have to cleanse or use micellular water beforeh
i used it for weeks without realizing that it was the cleanser doing that to my skin until i switched back to the cleansing foam
the whole putting this on dry face is very uncomfortable
this is more for someone with dry skin.
if i do not use a cleansing oil first i feel that i need to cleanse twice with this
at least that is what my rinsing cloth tells me.
it is good in that it is not drying
it's does sink in quickly
yet it doesn't leave my face "oily"
it does have the affect of making my skin more moisturized in the morning when i wake up
i still looked oily all day
you look a little oily today
i can't wear it alone because of the oily residue leaves behind
i can't wear it under foundation because it seems to break down the formula
the oil does not absorb well
my skin is so dry that after i wash
my skin feels as tight as if i had on a dried clay mask on-- i was hoping this oil would help that
i think it would probably work well for someone whose skin isn't as severely dry as mine
the oilds did on absorbe on my skin well
it even provides enough moisture for this harsh northeast winter
its cold cold weather
saying it caused their skin to get dry
i do like the metal thing they give you to roll the tube to get every bit of product out of the container as at this price
not for people with very dry skin!!!!
i think this probably is best for people with oily to normal skin because it is lightly hydrating
i honestly felt like it was just a bottle filled with cloudy water
couldn't even uses it long enough to see if it was moisturizing
it left my skin sort of sticky and almost greasy.
if you get a little on your lips
this feels like any other basic eye cream
i really just can't see that this liquid did anything at all for my dry skin
mine wasn't thick or rich like others have said
make it super oily
it also doesn't have an spf in it.
may make it more oily
however maybe it is good as a exfoliator used only once or twice a week
the fact that it left my skin kind of tight after cleansing
only a pea size amount is all you need to create a nice lather
it dried out my skin though
i feel this cleanser would be better suited for the warmer months as i find it a bit drying for the winter weather
it burned my skin underneath my chin it was horrible also felt like i had a lot of soap residue in my skin like a nasty film of soap scum gross will never try again
t wasn't ideal for use with my brush
i feel like they should label that it's for oily skin or something
tonight i tried the gentle cleanser thinking it might not make my skin oily since it does not have the
i typically don't mind if there is some fragrance in my products
it is not easy to rinse off
unfortunately didn't work out for me left a weird residue after cleansing my face
it's too drying for my skin
note i don't tan or go in the sun
rich but not greasy feel.
it is not for us oily skin girls
this does not work with my oily skin
does not make my sensitive skin break out
didn't feel like it absorbed into my skin
not just moderately dry
it's a fair cream for people who have very dry skin
it never goes away even after the moisturizer has absorbed into your skin
generally i have more oily skin
i recommend for those with very dry skin
however if you have oily t-zone
i found it very irritating and hard to absorb.
it does leave a film so use sparingly.
it didn't burn my eyes
this eye cream did nothing positive for my dry skin either
this is the only one that doesn't irritate or burn my skin around my eyes
it lets some of the cream dry out
what i didn't like was that the pump always got dry clumps of moisturizer before the next use
maybe too rich for my skin.
too bad it doesn't absorb into the skin.
this face oil was a little too oily on my face
but, it does give my face a little "glow".
i felt like even my regular moisturizers smooth my eye area out better than this
i would sometimes top it with kate's dilo oil or josie maran's argan oil to get some hydration
don't buy if you have even combination-oily skin.
like other reviews it left my face dry
you could actually see the dryness
make it rinse off when you apply water
just not right for my combination skin type
especially during colder months-feels nice-doesn't strip face of moisture-suitable for both dry
it made me super oily
i broke out more so now i am trying their clear complexion cleanser along with their charcoal pore pudding
it can also be drying
for me, it made my hands dry after a few uses.
my face was greasier than before i washed it
it did the job but it is too dry for my skin.
as soon as i applied it to my skin i felt a burning feel
it irritates my eye area no matter how many times i rinse it off
i felt like it did not remove my make-up as well as the cooling break-up make-up cleansing gel
it also burns if i get it anywhere near my eyes which is not what you want from a make up remover
it really dried out my skin
i found this very drying.
it doesn't seem to clean your skin at all
my skin that isn't even particularly dry to begin with
even after washing 3 times with this stuff
when i notice my skin is dry, i put this on.
my face actually feels drier when i use this.
it was a bit more sticky than my usual face oil bed time routine
i don't want to get oil all over my pillows
i don't really see a difference in my dry patches
almost can feel like it is burning sometimes
on the plus side it doesn't break me out or feel greasy on the skin
it doesn't sink in, makes my face greasy.
perhaps somebody with normal to semi dry skin that's not easily irritated will have better luck with this
moisture i get from this are not sufficient for my very dry skin
this worked wonders on my cheeks which tend to be very dry
maybe not for my skin, but no glow.
it doesn't feel heavy -- use only a tiny amount or most of it will end up on your pillow --
not oily at all
you don't want your skin to feel smothered
hydration is very good because the next morning i can't use my regular stuff as it will be too oily
i think it is good for dry skin type
if you're prone to milia then this is not the product for you as it is very very heavy
it didn't sting or burn
please stay away from this cream
i will use the whole jar
really scares me away from using other eye creams besides the one i use regularly
i won't expect it to wipe out the dark circles at all
and its too dry to be a nice eye cream
this gel-like consistency might be better for warmer weather
use something else to calm my skin down
when i wash my face at the end of the day my skin is still extremely parched
maybe better for someone with oily skin
i found my skin looking drier after a few weeks of use
now that it is getting colder
drier in the north east the product does not provide enough moisture for my sensitive/dry skin type
but it left my skin quite dry.
i needed an anti-aging lotion that wouldn't dry out my skin or cause me to break out
if you touch your face it will roll up
as someone with oil-combo skin
it actually made my face feel dry
combination--very oily in the oil zone
except lay like a very heavy cream that dries up
decided to use it because the weather is getting cooler
i do not think it had enough moisture for my skin
did not like the feel of the cream on my skin
i find there just isn't enough moisture for my normal to normal dry skin
it does dissipate after you put on the cream
i love them although they are a little bit dry for winter
it doesn't give me a mask or a sticky feeling which is nice
was really hoping this could just help with a gentle overturning of skin cells to renew the baby fresh skin we all want
the gel-like texture doesn't bother me
i find it just doesn't provide enough moisture for my relatively dry yet acne-prone skin
however it is incredibly hard to peel off
not a pleasure putting on my face or "peeling" it off
honestly it is like elmer's glue.
i mite as well use elmer's glue it would work better than this product
the mask was hard to get even due to its texture.
it dried pretty fast
it's gonna be very difficult to wash off the residue when it's wet
it is the accidentally-applied-a-little-too-thick part that bothers me
it takes me a very big effort to wash off the residue
t was very difficult to peel off
the red clay felt like a plastic material that wouldn't stick on my face
my skin had this oily texture that i did not like
i don't feel a little dry
my skin tends to by dry so this mask definitely leaves it a bit dry
i suggest you not to put a thick layer
because i put too much on my face that some parts did not dry thoroughly
it is so hard to wash off
it must've been too thin because it did not peel off very well
also very difficult to peel off.
maybe it isn't meant for dry/normal skin.
because i don't feel anything different after peeling the mask off
i could feel the dirt
i only used it in my t-zone where i am oily
thought this would be a great mask for my oily
it doesn't seem to get my pores super clean however i have broken out after using it
although, it is literally impossible to peel off.
it takes forever to peel off because it ends up leaving little places all over your face where it didn't peel uniformly
it just dried my face
it doesn't leave heavy residue
it doesn't peel off in big enough pieces
even then i still had dry patches
i didn't feel like it was deep cleansing
i like that you can peel it off
didn't notice any difference in my skin or that it cleaned out my pores
whenever i used it my skin would be oilier in the morning
i didn't find that it reduced my pores very much
i feel like this product could be good for all-over oily skin
it dried out my skin so much that my skin reacted by producing even more oil in my tzone
lacks the ability to do anything for my white/blackheads
has a tendency to dry out my skin
it's too expensive to be a body wash
it is a decent face wash.
on the plus side, did not over dry my skin.
i feel that my face is definitely more oily after using this product
doesn't really foam up at all in your hands.
my skin usually does fine during the winter
i splash my face with a lot of water
my combo skin does get quite oily in the summer
meaning it really stripped my skin
it caused my skin to produce even more oil.
keeping everything else in my skin care routine the same
this does fine on my normal to combo skin.
it made my skin feel really clean when i used it at night
all it really did was cause dry patches to appear
just really dried me out more than i needed
see if it works for her skin
i would really like this a lot more if it weren't for 2 things: the orange tint
i love this product because it has fixed my dry skin
i no longer suffer from mid day dry skin.
i feel like this cream leaves my under eye area even dryer
it's not oily, or greasy or heavy.
it doesn't leave any residue
this cream does not irritate my eyes
not for my age or skin type.
my sleep is irregular so take my review with a grain of salt
if this were to cost $40 i'd probably consider it because it moisturizes nicely
i did not feel any cooling sensation
nor did i find my skin any better off than with basic creams
i don't find it absorbs quickly so you have to wait a bit before applying concealer
it still burns when i apply it
i wouldn't use it during the day due to how oily your face looks
it gets absorbed ok on my dry areas
i will dry out
this may work well for someone with very very dry skin
i just didn't like how this milk cream applied on my face
it didn't help that the dropper wasn't picking up any product
did nothing for my patches
i just didn't like the oily feel to it
did not like the texture at all which was runny
didn't leave my face shiny or greasy.
wish they would put this into a pump like the sunscreen
my face felt too oily even with just a small application
if your skin type is combination/oily this product is not for you
it didn't irritate my skin or break me out
i did feel like an oil slick about 2 hours into wearing it
this product smelt so bad that i couldn't even keep it on for more than a minute
it didn't really absorb fully into my combination skin
oily it didnt set well into my skin
this product would not soak into my skin like they claim it does
my skin has not become dry or flaky so far this winter
my face was an oily mess after use
i got an oily "think" that's wasn't soaked by my skin
it didn't soak into my skin at all
i would just stick with the argan oil
night although it doesn't do anything amazing compared to much cheaper moisturizers
my usually combination oily skin has been dry lately due to winter
i could only use it at night as it left a greasy film on my skin that didn't absorb properly
i will stick to with the josie's plain argan oil.
this stuff just sat on my face like lard or hairgrease
this is not hydrating on its own it did nothing.
if you apply more it will just look super oily yet still not hydrated
it does have a milky consistency, hence the name.
left it very dry
now i wash it off
it left my skin drier than when i started
not in an oily way
it's not like the super mud or youth mud
for the price i was expecting it to do more than just keep my face moisturized
it gave my oily skin a moisturizing cooling effect which made me believe it would be suitable for me
left my skin looking drier than before
it made my skin even more dry
the tingle might be a bit too much for some people
they feel like my skin is being smothered in an unpleasant muck
this does irritate a bit.
if you touch your face afterwards it flakes
it does not apply smoothly over skin
the flaking could be due to another product interfering with your skin's moisture barrier or certain ingredients in this cream that don't seem to work with a particular skin type
had such high hopes for my dry skin
the texture is nice when you first put it on your fingers tip
it leaves the eye area completely white if you have to reapply
they made my eyes so oily
unfortunately it dried out
i wouldn't recommend it for people with dry or sensitive skin
it is just too sticky on my skin
it didn't feel like it cleaned my skin
i could feel it immediately starting to burn my skin
i don't like it due to the fact it leaves a kind of residue on my eyes that makes everything blurry for a little while
it takes forever to rinse off which is not a big deal
if you accidentally get this is your eye it will completely blur your vision
its my ride or die face wash
i couldn't fully wash off the oil
found that it was oily as well
don't open them until after you've rinsed
it'll leave this oily film over your eye balls
be very cautious when splashing water to activate the oil above your eyes
prefer this product over makeup removers which tend to dry the skin out
cleanse the face however it bothers my eyes after i use it
i found the formula of this primer to be really dry
made my face look too oily.
did absolutely nothing for fine lines or pores
my skin is oily through the t-zone
it didn't do anything in reducing the appearance of my pores
i don't always like to apply primer all over my face if i'm not going to be wearing foundation since i suffer from acne breakouts
purchased this hoping it would solve my problem of my pores around my nose becoming oily
my skin isn't oily by that time
it left me the oily
i still gave it three stars because it did not dry my skin
applied it to my undereye area it didn't go so well
it did absolutely nothing to my fine lines/pores.
i do not have greasy skin by any means-
this product would work great for someone with dry skin
f you are not dry
feel like the product doesn't absorb
my face becomes very sticky after i apply it
when i washed my foundation brush after applying it over this stuff
doesn't absorb at all
hence why you might see your pores looking more refined
if you are acne prone i'd stay far away from this
i went to sephora to find a primer for my wedding that would be good for oily/acne prone skin
my face felt like an oil slick both days that i tried it
i will admit it does seem to fill in pores
i just don't tolerate drying alcohols anymore they just are too damaging for the health of the skin
depending on what are your searching for in your day cream
my skin actually felt drier after applying
or for folks with less dry skin than i have
with the summer coming my skin can get greasy
this seemed like a good alternative to the jar cream
and my skin still feel dry and parched mid-day.
it doesn't seem to fully absorb into the skin
makeup doesn't seem to sit naturally over it
another thing i've noticed is that it flakes off if i touch my face after i apply it
its almost gone within a few minutes after you moisturize your face
this product is quite thick and oil for me.
at the beginning i thought the oily feeling might go away since the weather is cold
feels like some rubber crumbs come off on your face…
it does not contain spf which is okay for me because my cc cream has spf
i would say this face moisturizer would be best for somebody with sensitive skin
the cream is too much
i would definitely not use this lotion at night as it's not rich enough
it did burn my skin as well.
i must say it was fun to put the mint green mask on
as you rub it in
greasy that i could wipe the oil off my face with fingers
it doesn't leave my combination skin greasy
the extra spf also makes it feel greasy
the product is so dry
it makes your eye feel like you had glue on them
honestly just purchase a good under eye cream
mostly i just wanted eye cream that wasn't in jar packaging
i can't even remember how well it moisturized because of how annoying the tint was
it doesn't seem to sink in
it doesn't work well with my combination skin
it isn't quite good enough to replace my daily eye serum
i should be able to put the tube in my makeup bag without it exploding everywhere
it was so good that on casual days i might not even bother with concealer
would not recommend for dry under eyes
what it doesn't do is absorb/blend into my skin
although the same effect could be achieved with a cold spoon
only thing that i like was the way the product felt once you applied it with the metal part of the applicator
would probably recommend only if you don't have deep creases under your eye
you have to be careful about layering it as sometimes it doesn't blend too well depending on your other products
i agree with other people that said it was crumbly
i see little to no difference on my skin after washing it off
perhaps not enough for my oily skin.
it wasn't drying at all, though.
it might be a nice level of exfoliation for someone with more dry
it feels a bit drying while on
really give me the extra help my already-dry skin needs in the winter
did not break out my skin or cause my sensitive skin to react
i couldn't really tell that this did anything positive for my skin--although i'm hoping that in the winter when i have dry skin problems on my cheeks that using this under a moisturizer will make a difference
like putting water on your face
the consistency is very much like a cold cream
very much similiar to pond's cold cream
the hot towel is a bit of an inconvenience.
doesn't hold heat any longer than a regular washcloth
didn't feel that it cleaned my skin at all
it's so thin that it was cold before it did any good
with this one i don't see anything other than the fact it leaves my skin with a weird finish that looks both shiny
also it is a little hard to rinse off.
but besides that, this is a pleasant mask to use.
this gel mask did nothing to me.
i need a mask once a week for the drying that sometimes can affect my skin
maybe the cucumber mask will work better in a pure hydration way
it does not sting or make my skin red
beware if you have sensitive skin!
i would not recommend this product to anyone with oily/combination skin
you're guaranteed to dry your face out
you have to get the absolute perfect amount for this cleanser to work
this is the most drying face wash i have ever used
it is too drying for my face as a daily cleanser--entirely subjective
it isn't even good close to the eyes--which sort of defeats the purpose of face cleanser
particularly if you have more oily skin
if you've had issues with cleansers drying out your skin skip this one
i feel like they're too harsh maybe because of the glycolic acid
getting your skin used to the acid over time
it was so drying to my skin.
even though i have dry skin
give it another shake during the summer when my skin is oilier
this dried out my skin like crazy
however, this dried my skin out like crazy!
i don't know what it is about the texture/gel
dry it out even more
however i have also read that glycolic acid/bha/ahas need to be left on the skin for a few minutes at a minimum in order to have any effect
if it's in a regular face wash that you'll just immediately rinse off with water
not overly drying kind of clean
i felt this product was drying
it also has this really thick texture that makes it hard to wash your face with
im still trying to get the dryness
it's a great cleanser just dried my face out way too much
then all of a sudden it starts to eat your skin
so this foundation may work better for someone with drier skin
if your skin is light
good sunscreen but too oily, broke me out
my skin is not bad at all
if your skin has little to no imperfections then this would work
the serum does not seem to absorb into my skin leaving it feeling sticky or like i have more makeup on than i do
i wouldn't have returned it if it didn't dry my skin out
way too greasy for someone with oily skin.
then realized the extra oil that it made me very oily
except it still tends to make my face too dark
makes my combo skin oily after a few hours if i dont set it with a thick layer of powder
it is not dry but dark and has little coverage.
it wasn't shear enough for me
didn't leave any dry looking patches on my skin
it's not really that moisture my skin
after use it i can feel powder on my skin
i really like that this protects against the sun.
so will having someone dump a bucket of ice water on you
since putting this on--even my ever oily t-zone feels too dry
only good if you're going for that freshly sunburned look
my skin got no long lasting moisture from this product
wonder if it really moisturizes at all.
it is not extremely viscous hence it is easy to apply an even layer to the face
not dry at all
i started to get dry patches
any other dryness it just made me break out
i put extra virgin olive oil on my face when it needs that little extra layer of oil at night
my skin drank it up so fast i had to be sure to quickly apply a night cream over it
my eyes wouldn't stop watering whenever i worse it
it did not clear up the skin around my eyes like it claims
i've noticed it makes my eyes just burn so bad
they won't stop watering
i would stay away from this gel unless you want the skin under your eyes to shine big time
so first off let me tell you i have normal/oily skin
let it sit for a good 20-30 mins while i do my hair
drying out my undereye area is the worst thing about it
think about it this way- oily skinned people typically get recommendations for gel formula items because they aren't super-rich
which means they are probably slightly drying
it tends to burn more after i have recently taken off my eye makeup
although the second strip that it comes with that's supposed to make your pores smaller did work pretty well
with the drug store ones there is always a decent amount of blackheads on the strip
not enough blackhead removal for how dry i got.
they were not drying like this
the patch afterward however doesn't even fit on my nose
was my nose wet enough?
it did not pull anything out of my pores or help my blackheads in any way
the dry strip felt so good
the dry strip was very hard to remove
i liked the follow up wet strip to soothe
the dry strip does absolutely nothing-- it's dismaying that sephora no longer carries the boscia pore strips because that is an infinitely superior product that actually removes blackheads
i liked the wet strip to apply after the dry one.
it will do a better job this this overpriced pore strip that did nothing to remove blackheads
the first strip you apply to a wet face
you let it dry
it took a lot longer to dry because it comes soaked in product
the wet strip was horrible as well
the instructions said to wet your skin
i could not get the dry patch to adhere to my nose at all
what i did really like was the wet strip you put on directly after you remove the dry strip
then you have to rip it off of the sensitive skin of your nose
this will burn you eyes like crazy even after cleaning off the stuff
this line is so heavily fragranced that if you are sensitive avoid it
it was so bad that i had to wipe it off almost immediately i suspect the spf was way too harsh for my sensitive eye area
however the day cream was so hard to work into my skin
once there it was very greasy
you could noticeably tell where i applied the day cream
it didn't just "dry on the skin" it dried out my skin
when i applied water after it dried like instructed it was so awkward to wash off
it did do a decent job cleansing my pores
when i washed it off my skin was soooooooo soft
i can't see this working for people with dry skin
adding your own oils to it for a do-it-yourself type mask
unfortunately it is way too drying for me
you apply it to already clean skin
this mask did nothing for my skin
i do enjoy how it turns into an oil cleanser!
it felt pleasant because it turns into an oil treatment when you wash off the mask
usually when i use the supermud or thirstymud or youthmud masks
this was just way too rough on my already dry skin
although in my less dry areas
this would be amazing for those of you with oily to combination skin
us dry skin ladies
this glamglow product seems too drying for my already dry skin
i always followed up with fab ultra repair so my skin wouldn't try out
i did not like the way my skin felt after i rinsed
as well as it didn't change my skin texture as i wanted
i couldn't wait to wash it off
i can barely keep this serum on for more than an hour without it drying the heck out of my skin
i agree with all of the reviewers who complained that this product pilled when layered underneath anything else
it is way too sticky
it does not melt into the skin at all
the product is so sticky
i prefer gels because they tend to skin in faster
maybe that why it felt uncomfortable as it dried under my eyes
it's not it is a sticky thick gel feels like glue you can not even move your eyes when it's dry
it is imposible go use it by night cause your hair get stuck in your eyes with the gel
this stuff is so sticky.
i found it sticky that when i would wake up i would literally have to move my skin
it seems to make my eye area feel tight after it dries
i find it way to much greasy
only found it to be sticky
it's very sticky and does not absorb for a while.
this product feels sticky around your eye area after you apply it
after the gel is applied it starts to get tacky
they still feel sticky
i didn't care for the texture of this--it seems to sit on the skin
fake cucumber smell other people reviewed don't bother me
i still use until i find another eye cream to fix my fine lines
still doesn't do anything for the puffy bags!
don't use too much at a time it is on the gooey side
the gel not so much
but it does feel kinda sticky on my eye area.
it was as if the gel never fully dried.
it would still feel sticky
not enough to want to stick with this product as my routine/everyday eye gel or cream
it was just like a good scrub.
i'd say if you have more tolerant skin this would be a great exfoliating mask
this face wash was just ok
i tend to have dry skin to begin with
it just leaves my skin way too dry
i found it to be very drying
unfortunately it left my skin dry
i do not wear foundation or use any type of powder on my face
it makes my skin feel squeaky clean like when you wash dishes which i do not like
i could feel my dry skin immediately after washing
it is really really burns when it gets in your eyes
it turned out to be extremely drying for my skin
i found it very drying.
this product made my face burn
be cautious if you're sensitive or dry to begin with
so i suggest using it as a night cream!
it is a bit oilier than i care for
i do not have oily skin
i wouldn't recommend this to anyone who has combo to oily skin
if you are not scent sensitive this cream may be for you
i don't want anything this harsh that seeps into my eyes so easily on my face
i feel like this one improves the texture of the skin just a little bit or perhaps even just temporarily during the day
didn't help my dryness like other people's reviews claim
it isn't quite as liquidy as a lot of serums can be
it does give some moisture to my skin
i couldn't even get through the sample because it felt terrible on my skin
unfortunately it just made my skin drier
it takes me so long to get it off using the oil
usually an oil cleanser is enough to get even waterproof make up off
it felt a bit heavy on my skin which wasn't a big deal since you do wash it off any ways
it was not too drying after you wash your face off though
hanging onto the bottle for refills when needed from my regular size wash will likely make up for it
i couldn't use it too often because it made my eyes water so bad
esp if it's windy outside or if i have eyeliner or mascara on
it does make your eyes sting very badly
okay for general moisture
t will burn if you accidentally get it in your eyes
get the night creme if you have dry skin
maybe this cream was meant for users who are layering product underneath
i couldn't get the scent off of my fingers afterwards
it dried my skin even more
the only things i notice with this product is that it dries out my skin
it honestly felt like a thick grease being spread on my face
was difficult to wash off
beside taking off all the moisture that was in my skin
when it got wet
the consistency is watery it's not a gel at all i think mine is defective comes out like water
it does however make my skin feel greasy after a while if i use this
was hoping for something to perk up my winter skin
i don't care if this made my skin as smooth as a baby's bottom
which might be because the waxy feeling were my own oils
usually my skin type
it turned into a gritty sludge that had such an awful texture it made me cringe
for someone who doesnt mind the texture
as you warm it up
just doesn't work with my skin
its definitely not for dry skin.
you may feel it more sticky or cause the break out
you see the drying effects of alcohol
it has a watery consistency then balls up like silicone when you put on your makeup
you basically have to rub your face
i am 40-year-old with dehydrated dry skin been using this i do not see no difference in my skin
in my cheek area not sure if it's from this product
i don't have dry skin
so this might help people with dry skin
night which seems to do the trick for my skin
which was already full of acnes anyways
this cream did not soften them at all
this one even i tissue it off like it reccomends
unfortunately for me this actually made my skin drier
probably it good for dry skin.
thought that was the reason for the un-rinsed feeling
i tried this due to bare minerals changing all of their skin care products
i don't like how runny they are
it should be after a foaming cleanser if you have dry skin or before if your skin is normal
when i scrub my face with water it doesn't really foam as much
overall i don't feel like it actually cleanses my skin
which would then leave an slight oil layer on my face
it would leave a layer of residue on my face that i just wasn't use to
to get through my wash
then a cream when you add water
now that it is humid
hot outside my skin does not agree with this
it's like putting oil on your already oily skin
it was not a good cleanser at all: did not remove my make up
did not foam up
it seemed to rinse of well enough
i don't see the benefit of spending this much on a skin care product that makes me nauseous
i like that this goes on dry without any water.
once you apply water
it has an oily feel to it
i much prefer the boscia make up break up oil.
kind of difficult to rinse completely--
i still feel its weird waxy residue on my face after trying to wash it off with another cleanser
currently i'm using this as a lazy cleanser in the mornings to get lingering makeup
it cleanses okay, but not the best.
it's a weird consistency that is difficult to actually absorb out of the container from your finger to your eye
though i found that it was a bit too thick/ didn't absorb completely
unless you have bad crows feet
about the only thing i like is the texture of the cream
i chose this eye cream over numerous other eye creams because it was the only one i could find that didn't give me an "oil slick"
tried it a couple times just to make sure it was in fact this making my eyes burn/water
i think it actually dries my skin out a bit
this balm is great for removing most of your make up
it's really hard to keep this stuff out of your eyes when you're removing eyeliner
once it gets in your eyes
i usually have to do two rounds of cleansing to remove the oiliness if i use this to remove my make up
it does leave a heavy
only used it as a precleanser or underneath mud masks which are always too drying for me
if you are considering using it as i was sweet almond oil removes makeup better
although it does leave a little bit of residue
if you're going to make a product that leaves such a residue
very very odd face wash.
i find it to only be effective if i theb use a warm damp cloth to actually take everything off
if you use it on its own it leaves an oil/gel like film on the face
you're better off with a face wash from this company
i never experienced the emulsified milk phase not matter how long used it
leaves behind a film of oil that is difficult to wash off
all it does is smear it all across your face
then when you apply water to turn it into a "milk"
too oily for me
i might find use for this as an eye area remover only
unfortunately i found it to be too oily for my skin
the container is awkward to use when your washing your face
was very hard to rinse off
i used another face wash afterwards to take off the oily film
it was really hard to wash off
you can get the same effect by using a scoop of coconut oil to wash your face
with the same result: you're going to need to grab another cleanser to get this greasy stuff off
also doesn't do much to get regular mascara off.
none of them left an oily residue like this one did
i do not like the tub design
too inconvenient to use in the shower
water gets in it
sometimes cleansing oils get a little messy because they can get so runny
just get wasted between your fingers before you even apply it to your face
there is absolutely no way that this cleanser will be adequate on its own--a follow-up cleanser must be used otherwise you're just going to end up with grease on your face
this felt like it didn't rinse off
i guess if you wear tons of stubborn makeup
usually need to wash twice
would not recommend for oily skin.
rather was just oily
it won't sting or irritate
my skin felt worse after washing it than it did before
for dry skin, it might be a great product.
oil-based cleansers have always been hit or miss for me
it's this unguinous creepy-feeling gel that you put on your dry face with dry h
on my skin and i have oil residue on my face.
i don't get the milky texture when i add a little water either
much better cleansing oils out there that provide a better oil for your skin
this cleansing oil easily removed my make up with one pump of product
what i had loved up to today was it rinsed off fairly clean
start on dry skin
it absorbs well into your skin if you pat it in as instructed
even when i use less of the cream
the product did not seem to absorb into the skin
way too light for dry skin
it seemed sticky in my t-zone
it felt more hydrating than anything else.
i will say my skin gets more sensitive in the colder months
i went in needed a mask or creme because heat
i actually have to mix with day cream to get full moister
just now starting to come into my own skin routine that makes me all glowy in the mornings
i found this product to be incredibly drying during the day
perhaps it would be a good moisturizer to use under something else for the dry/normal skinned people
without having the extra ingredients i don't care for
i find it a little drying
i think it is good for a in between wash
but my skin tends to be dry in the winter.
bought in the winter to moisture my skin during the cold weather
i recommend just putting the product on dry parts of your skin
your skin is seriously in need of quenching
so i slathered it on and still to no avail.
found out that there was salicylic acid in it.
pretty sure that the cream made them worse
it was too drying
this didn't cleanser did not seem to clean my face well
two pumps is definitely not enough to remove my make up
it thins out very quickly i had to keep reapplying the product to my clarisonic to finish my routine
i don't like the really bitter taste of it when it reaches my lips
it actually left my skin with dry flakes the first time i used it
it dried my skin out really badly
due to it burning my face so bad
i tried both on wet
also you have to use on dry skin which is weird.
the product does not clean skin very well
it did nothing for my pores or fine lines
unfortunately it gives me dark blackheads where i use it
not greasy in the slightest
it kinda dried out my 57 year old skin.
this just is too drying for older skin.
i think it did an adequate job as a moisturizer in that my face didn't feel tight after applying it
it has done nothing to bring more moisture to my skin
my skin is on the dry side normally
where i live in the desert it is very dry
i think my nightly sheet-masks for 20 mins does a better job at hydrating
it did nothing for my pores
not greasy in the slightest
too sticky it was tacky around my eyes say no change returned
i just couldn't get over how tiny the jar is!
my skin was even drier than it normally would be on days i wasn't wearing makeup
my skin is super dry - this did not help one bit.
guess it boils down to personal preference here.
if you wanted to combat oily skin for a night this works
my face has become dry
it's also quite drying if you have normal/combination skin
not sure how it'd interact with oily skin.
for that much money i'd rather buy a cooling facial pad
perhaps i should consider applying this product to my chest area when i feel like skipping pecs at the gym
some of the ingredients just didn't work well on my skin
it's got a very mask-like consistency that dries
just felt like another layer of product on my face
it did not irritate my skin
after reading the reviews i thought this product would be perfect for my dry flaky
i tried applying it to damp skin to see if that made a difference
jart ceramidin oil balm to be a fail
this was too greasy without great results
to use it because it makes me feel like i should be camping outdoors with bugs
when applying it to my face it actually made my skin feel tighter
dry even after applying it
its it's hard to find a thick cream that helps my dry skin
i need something thicker
this definitely is not drying
sometimes i'll follow it with this oil balm
i just find that my skin doesn't soak it up
strangely enough very drying
it's just so unsanitary to keep putting my fingers in
didn't absorb so my face looked oily
coconut oil does the same thing to me
i think i like it better than jm's infinity cream because it does not have the orange smell
i will stick with my simple water over this one.
the last thing you want to do is tug near your eyes which in the long-run causes wrinkles
i too have noticed a leftover residue so you're going to have to rinse
now that i'm halfway through the bottle i noticed that it leaves a sticky residue on my skin
i feel as though i'm just rubbing my face with a cotton ball of water
it is so sticky
then sometimes still using another product to remove the residue left in
it also burns if you get it in your eyes
tastes bitter if you get any on your lips
accidentally open my mouth or lick my lips for twenty minutes after or i'd get a bad taste in my mouth from the micro water on my face
they've never caused a bad taste if i wash my face
my skin would feel clean without the need to rinse
it feels like your typical toner with a wet
and i actually find it hard to rinse off.
its maybe 1 or 2 occasionally
how does a product go from dense
i can feel it wash off in the morning meaning it did not soak in
it ended up somehow being drying even though it was so oily
when i wash my face in the morning it is very slick when the water hits it
i too have had a little issue with it giving me some clogged pores
to be expected with a super thick cream on your face all night though
it does take a little bit to absorb fully into my skin
hard to keep my hair out of it
it is very gooey but it is dry by the morning.
feel more drier that i usually do.
my skin actually felt drier after using this product
we literally wash our face with cristco.
on top of that my face didn't look any better or felt any more moisturized than usual
like it doesn't absorb.
when ur washing ur face the product cames off the skinthe cream is very expensive for it to just wash away
it was so sticky
it took a little longer because the "residue" felt really slick
def not worth the $$$ very oily hard to wash off because of how oily the product have seen no results only plus is the smell of the product
it made my skin really dry in some areas
basically i can get the same effect with any silicone primer
i even thought it was a little drying which didn't help my wrinkles
i just put a useless cream on my face.
my results might be delayed because i'm unable to wear in the morning because it doesn't look right under my concealer
i've noticed that it's very drying under my make up
this time the cream does not burn my skin
when you wash it off
i do like how it feels minty on the skin it ruined my skin
my skin still won't clear up
i noticed it really has no benefits for my skin it didn't help with oiliness or my pores
the pump is always getting clogged
sort of like your skin is breathing
i've never once had oily skin unless i need a shower
which is strange because other reviews have said that it's taken away their oily skin
before i started using it i didn't have oily skin
dried my skin out so badly that it didn't matter how much heavy duty cream i put on
except this time it was the acne underneath the skin that hurts to barely touch
as someone with combination/oily skin
also i didn't find that it foams up very well.
only get very minimal foam
in order to get a good foam i had to leave my h
i think the over drying caused my skin to breakout
so you can take this review with a grain of salt
less messy to take it off there
this product would be great for oily skin
is terrible for dry skin like mine
so, this sits, sadly, in my shower...unused.
it really did nothing for my oily/combo skin
get a good lather out of this
it never lathered for me
i like my washes to lather otherwise i don't feel like i get a good clean
i am still oily
i expect after i use this mask in the morning my skin shouldn't be as oily as it was before
no no for oily skin.
and it did nothing for my pores.
i also felt like my skin was still dirty after i used it
no matter how much i rinsed
i couldn't get the feel of some kind of residue off my face
when adding water it doesn't really foam
will not break out my skin
at the same time trying to not let it squirt everywhere
it makes a filmy mess when trying to remove any type of make-up
it just created a mess that i had to use a washcloth
it would not be easy to rinse off
when i used it just to wash my face
i end up using a lot of this when i wash my face because it doesn't feel like it's really cleaning or foaming up
i found that it was really drying out my combination skin
i would not recommend it for someone with very dry skin
i can't imagine rinsing it off though
its good if you have super dry skin
otherwise i would use a better cleansing oil like the tatcha line
i feel like it's not cleaning my face properly
did not absorb well into my skin at all
instead made me greasy
i felt so itchy at the first time using it.
probably works for dry
my face continuously felt dry thru the day which was irritating my skin
it definitely won't leave your skin glowy in any way
although it was not greasy it did break out my skin
it has this sort of cooling feeling when applied that made the spots where i have some adult acne burn--
just be careful if you have sensitive dry skin
this was made my skin too oily with the socal weather
my skin is not usually dry or oily
use it during the winter season if my skin gets too dry
i need something thicker.
i will stick with my sprays as its light enough to not cause oil buildup yet perfect for hydration
it just made it look dry
drys my dry spots even more
i don't recommend for dry skin.
it simply made my skin look like garbage
it absorbs quickly otherwise it really hasn't done anything to my skin
if i just wanted moisture
i tend to get super dry in the winter
...but i really like to use it on my lips.
this is too drying for my skin.
even after that i get a good amount of residue on a cotton pad
if i try a face wash
it's not that i just didn't rinse it off enough
i still had a nasty oil layer
so weird but this oil dried out my skin.
this is the only one that's ever actually dried out my skin
i didn't find any difference with my 20 bucks marula oil
little did i know that this oil was causing milia on my skin
doesn't seem to sink in
i feel like it doesnt sink into my skin
it seriously doesn't absorb into my skin at all!
when i use it in the morning my skin looks greasy
my skin doesn't feel soft at all after applying it-unlike every other oil i've tried
it was way too oily for my oily skin
my skin is drier than ever
i read that oils are very good at locking in all the skin loving nighttime treatments you use at night
it just does not absorb it just sits on top of my skin making it oily
this just never soaked in
was afraid to put my face on my pillow to stain it
probably better for drier skin folks.
this does tighten my skin
it is quite sticky
i might as well be rubbing water on my face for all the good it does
did not irritate skin so at least it's not harming skin
it is not drying at all
other parts of my face are starting to feel dry
the bottle did claim to irritate sensitive skin at first before it gets better
on my skin which usually doesn't tend to break out much was breaking out like crazy
sticking it into a wet container just seems unsanitary to me
tight feeling i always immediately got after rinsing it off
it was very drying for me
i can maybe see this working on oily/combo skin
not dry skin like mine
the ph for soap is way too high for your face
i feel that it does clear my pores
i will say that it didn't dry out my already dry skin
way too drying for my combination skin.
giving it 2 stars because it did lather well
there was no or only minimal lather or foam.
did not dry out my skin
my skin would often be oily
it did not minimize the look of my pores at all
it was too drying.
didn't dry out my skin
$35 for a bar of soap that is smaller than a bar soap you get off of the shelves is steep
i just add a bit of water on the bar
when you lather it with water the bar of soap doesnt melt or soften up like regular soap so there isnt waste on it
as i am very curious to see how the marula oil works on my usually normal
unfortunately it left my skin dry
i don't know how an oil can leave skin drier
did not make my skin excessively shiny
guess it's not made for dry sensitive skin like mine
surprisingly my skin feels more dry than before i started using this product
by itself as part of my routine made my skin more oily than usual
it felt like it never fully absorbed into my skin
if i go more than 3 days without using a moisturizer on top of it i get dry patches
this would be fine if the product write up didn't make it sound like it could function as a moisturizing oil
it dried my skin out so bad
this unfortunately was too drying for me
skin out instantly -- felt like it had soap in it anyway
used it as body wash after i decided i couldn't use it for my face
skin care buuuuut i just can't get out of my mind that i'm rubbing corn starch on my face
it would be good for someone with oily skin.
i still had to go in with a cleansing oil
it burns your eyes if you get it inside
i usually had to wash my face twice with this stuff to get 90% clean
so when i was washing my face with this after not wearing my powder
when i used my fab pads after that there was still discoloration on them
i doesn't not make my mascara move one bit.
after using it i had to rewash my face because it was so sticky
had to rewash with something else because it was so sticky
it dried out my skin somewhat
i got it primarily because of the winter dryness i tend to get
you can't really remover your makeup unless you use a cotton pad to wipe off the emulsion as the director tells you to do
the fact that you have to wipe makes it stimulating
when i applied it it felt kind of heavy
it didn't do anything for my puffiness i actually found it to ma make my eyes look puffier
my eye bags make sure to show it
the cool iron tip does feel nice
i can say that the only thing i liked about it was the cool feeling of the applicator under the eye
when it dries it gets flaky- i returned this one!
a big issue i have w this product is this weird crust like finish once it dries up on my eye bags
the lil iron was so cute as to say that your ironing out the puff rather than a rollerball like other similar products use
i could overlook that if the product were decent however it did nothing to soothe my undereye or moisturize it
it made my under eye are even drier than it was
it only started flaking off when i'd apply this eye cream under it
with the cold iron i would expect instnt results
however it's nice to have a cooling gel go under your eyes before you do your makeup
i think i need more moister
light as you use it
afterwards: your face is as dry as a cotton ball
the kind of dry feeling a bar soap would give
all i can see is dry patches
i want products that are going to somewhat be drying due to acne
similar to what it feels like if you use a cheap bar soap on your face
did nothing for my skin except completely dry it out
just a dab is all i need for my entire face.
i would say it may be best for oily skin
am not prone to dry patches
it was like cleaning my face with dirty old socks
it felt sticky once dry
do not recommend for gals with normal to dry skin
it didn't make my face not dry
doesn't hold moisture for an extended time if i only use the serum
it seems to have a drying effect on my oily
this product is not for my skin type which is dry
it starts to create this buildup that i can actually slough off as i try to apply my moisturizer
how non-greasy it was
because i often use my josie maran organ oil before it
to try if you're just starting off with serums
if your overly sensitive watch out
not for my dry skinfeels
my skin doesn't feel remotely "lifted" not "firm" after using this
just feels like you have powder on
i feel like it pulls my skin a little when i apply it
i always feel the need to go in with a harsh scrub after just because i still feel it on top of my skin
the last few times i've used it it has made my pimples extra red for a while after i rinse it off
f i want that gold shimmer to stay on my face i will lightly rinse my face to get that effect
which is cool if you want that or it either clogged my pores
i would say this mask is a luxurious way to treat yourself to glowy
i would say that i like this better than the irish moor mud mask because it has brought more impurities to the surface than the mud mask
this mask did nothing for my skin.
doesn't dry before you wash it off
my dry skin folks
i would recommend the rose stem cell one esp when you cool it in the fridge first
powder or liquid does not look like that
my older dry skin needed a boost.
it did however make my skin oilier
i don’t know if maybe that’s just cuz my skin is dry after i rinse this off?
maybe if your skin is more sagging
it won't stop burning
i feel my face sticky even though i rinse it twice
also the packing is very uncomfortable you have to touch the all product in order to take a bit or you have to reach for a brush or something
i don't think this is cleansing my skin at all.
i tried the product on my normally dry/sensitive skin after buying it as a sample
it dried out my skin even more
help put some moisture back
after the 10 mins was up i washed it off as directed only to reveal what looked like a bad sunburn
this was unlike any mud masque i have tried- it doesn't dry
it was still sticky
be forewarned that it is messy-after rinsing it off
i would rather it be dry than oily
didn't do anything to eliminate clogged pores or keep them from coming
it wasn't too drying
your pores are always going to be the same size
may as well have just washed my face again
in order get the residue all off
it does create the right amount of foam for entire face to be cleaned
i get black what appears to be dirty foam all over the sink
i like the fact you have the bar to rinse the oil off of your face
it do has some effect in deep cleansing
i can literally feel it pulling my skin when i done washing my face
it is overly drying
this is definitely for someone with oily skin
am oily in some places
all i have seen this wash do is give me what appears to be a chemical burn
this cleanser was amazing for getting my skin clear even though i only had like 3 pimples at the time
guess this isn't for me because it gave me a chemical burn a couple days of use all over my face
i get greasy in my t-zone
this is a great cleaner if your face is extremely oily
t was extremely drying
it gets soapy enough so that my skin actually feels like it's getting clean
i like that this one actually feels like a face wash
even if you have really oily skin like me
this one really dried my skin out
even in my oily t-zone area
it dried me out so bad.
i started experiencing a lot of dry scaly flakes on my skin that i did not have prior to using this
i decided to not put any makeup on so my skin could breathe
average to no suds with cool water
it drys my already dry skin out so much to the point we're my nose starts peeling
maybe if i had oily or combo skin i'd like it better
after using on my normal/dry skin
its so oily it made my face break out because i have combination skin it made my skin gross
this product didn't seem to work well on my dry skin at all
they won't dissolve if you're just gently patting this on your eye
so you should pop them between your fingers first
it didn't do anything besides the beads making my under-eye area sting a little bit
my eye area does not get dry
it was so drying
in fact it dries them out
it is really drying now
i guess i am older and need more moisture.
tried it on clean skin without any other product
very drying which is the opposite of what you want
it doesn't get rid of any darkness at all
i cannot get past the way the product dries
is impossible to 'break' the beads unless you rub your eyes rather roughly
i feel it's dried the skin under my eyes more
i found it difficult to apply because of the "beads"
the little grains are hard to rub in, just messy
didnt do any good for meonly pronouced my fine lines even more when got dry
don't waste your $100 on this cream
it does moisturize and cool, but it kinda stings.
great for warmer weather
even so this dried out my skin terribly
i guess i would recommend it only for oily skin
for dry skin or combination skin: beware
it never really got foamy for me.
it would be difficult to wash off all of the beads if i wasn't in the shower
i rarely have products dry out my face
my skin dried out so bad.
it wasn't just patches either.
otherwise i think it does a pretty good job in washing make-up off
the scent is so strong it sticks to your skin for hours after having used it
i would not recommend this for people with sensitive/dry skin
i don't think it cleans my skin
nothing seems to be helping with this new dryness
since i've been coping with oily skin all my life i didn't even have any products on h
after trying the thirsty cleanser i thought i would love this one just as much
it does not foam up very well
it did well on my oily t-zone
it leaves a residue on my skin that i have to cleanse my face with another soap just to get it off
i felt that it was hard to rinse off immediately.
this looks just like the treatment mask when it comes out of the bottle
you just don't get the tingling when it sits on your skin
i just don't feel like it absorbs any of the oil or especially make-up or dirt at the end of the day
found the cleanser to have little chunks in it when i applied to my face
this was kind of strange to use because you put it on your face dry
i might give it another shot or get a sample of another type of glam glow cleanser
it does foam but it just wasn't for my skin.
i feel like this cleanser made me break out more
when ever u dry your skin slowly
it dried my skin out so bad
i didn't realize it was like a mud
there was so much dead skin that i kept having to exfoliate more
unfortunately the cleanser dried my face out more than it was before
it actually dried up my skin
mine does not foam like it claims
my face didn't feel soft after using it
it was still dry
the major problem is it left your skin super dry after wash
i could see little dry stops that usually never happen with my normal cleanser
dry not to mention super red
i love the mask so when i needed more hydration on a daily level
it wasn't as hydrating as i thought it would be.
this really didn't cleanse my face all that well
it just felt thick and sticky when applied.
i wanted something that would keep my skin from becoming ashy
i've noticed that it makes my skin even drier after use
like my skin was 10x thirstier than it already was
i typically have sensitive skin anyways
every time after cleansing using this product i would feel the dryness of my skin immediately
but it's drying me out.
i normally do not like spending a lot of money in cleansers since you just wash them down the drain
i didnt feel like it really cleaned my skin all that well
id good for someone who have combo to dry skin
i don't feel that it hydrates as much as i'd like at all
it doesn't soak in well at all
it just looks icky when i touch or rub my under eye area
so as long as i don't touch my eye area/anywhere i put this cream
i feel itch after apply it
just because it says paraben free does not mean it doesn't have other chemicals galore
not oily or too heavy
however, no good for my dry wrinkle!
this cream is refreshing when you put it on
my skin doesn't absorb this cream at all
this gel did not burn as much as i though it would
then it dried my eye lids out so bad that it made me look 10 years older
not sure it does anything more than hydrate the eye area
i've noticed after a couple of months that i get the flaky dry patches of skin on my face after about 8-10 hours of wear -- not sure if it is the climate
i need moisture that is going to stay the course at least until my next cleansing
probably can't muster enough moisturizing power for the dryest winter months
it does not comfort the skin at all
i don't have dry patches or flaky skin
it made my sink dirty since it would leave residue from the oil
did help with dry h
tbh i would just use it for washing the body
my skin did not feel super clean after using this product
i can clearly see on the cotton pad that makeup is still in my pores
i found i had to wash my face again with a different cleanser to feel like my skin has actually been cleaned
especially one you rub on your eyes
thick right away no matter how much oil you pump out
makes it hard to rub your face of makeup when you have to add water right away
it's not very effective for cleaning make-up
i think i will go through this fairly quickly as it takes about three pumps to get any lather from this oil
i believe it is more appropriate for young skins i just don"t think my skin is so dewy after using
smearing oil on a face full of make-up felt really gross
didn't leave my skin dry
then add some water
could not wait to wash my face
i assure you it is irritating your skin down at the pore base
don't spend 100$ to irritate your skin.
i usually try to avoid putting anything on my face that contains fragrance
it does clean your skin
the only downside of this cleanser is that it did not leave my skin feeling cool
it has not cleaned up acne nor does it seem to clean my face
not sure about the not rinsing thing
it definitely won't break down a good sunscreen on its own
i can use it during the summer though which is a good thing just as a tinted moisturizer
- it is so heavy
she assured me that this would take on the color of my skin
maybe this works for people with dry
they smell and burn my eyes if i sweat.
if it weren't for the tint i would use it.
i just don't think that this cream is good for people like me who have combination skin that is oily in the t-zone
so this cream really isn't "great for all skin types" like they claim
maybe someone with normal or dry skin would do better with it
the weather was hot and very dry.
it doesn't feel like being absorbed either.
had to remove it quickly mostly because of the smell
avoid it if you are sensitive to smell
then when you put it on your skin it smells like a dirty #2 diaper or dirty poopy baby wipes mixed with chocolate
at least it eventually dries though
this product is so sticky
doesn't cause flare-ups for my oily
to be patient because it will draw out impurities before you notice glowing skin
told myself to keep using to get out all the impurities
other than that it does good job in smoothing out the skin
the color changing effect is neat to see when you "done" i didn't like the rubbery feel it left on my face
felt sticky on skin like it never absorbed
i found that as an oily skin type it was too much for during the day
it did cleanse the face quite well
it smells like the soap used at rest areas on the nys thruway
i just didn't care for that fact that unless i rinsed it off very thoroughly
i could have even put up with having to rinse
however it does leave the orange pigment on your skin if you do not rinse of very well
not really an "indicator" of cleanliness-doesn't really create lather-stings eyes when rinsing
the foaming effect doesn't last very long
i felt that this product was too drying
rather that it is supposed to soften
it just makes me feel super dry
while it didn't leave my face sticky
i normally have combo-to-dry skin
however it does moisture and has spf 22 i believe
yes my skin is a little bit brighened when i apply it
shouldn't it brighten up ur skin from the inside?
first of all you are getting the amount specified it just settles in the bottle secondly this is terrible for your skin because of the shells to exfoliate
i also like how fine the powder is
the texture is great if you want a more abrasive scrub
or you just use very little if your skin is sensitive
if your skin is clear
it does clean my skin effectively
it was just too drying/abrasive for me for daily use
it doesn't really seem to work any better or worse than other exfoliating products
too much product comes out when you tip the bottle
my face got so overheated from being so oily that i couldn't get rid of the redness/oily feeling even after washing my face
it made my face dry - even the oily t-zone.
the smell does not dissipate after you put it on either
i do prefer it to the glamglow clay mask because it doesn't dry out my skin
it is a bit sticky
i feel like my skin can't breathe with this stuff on
if your skin is at all oily
c products out there that are far less greasy
i hate the formulation of this--it is so sticky on my skin
i also had a breakout which i believe was directly related to texture leaving a sort of gummy film on the surface of my skin
had issues with this being terribly drying.
i did notice my pores look smaller when i use it.
i now have normal/dry skin.
i noticed my skin looks extra patchy when i use it so you need to moisturized really good before h
didn't get oily through the day.
this primer did nothing to control my oil.
tend to get a tad oily in my t zone during the summer months
as it gets warmer
my skin gets more oily i may try it again to see if i get a better result
if your someone with oily skin you will probably like this product
i've used hope in a jar dry for quite some time now
i could not mattify it with any powder
i've used hope in a jar sensitive/dry for years
my skin seemed more oily throughout the day when i used it
i loved the original hope in jar for dry skin
as other reviewers had noted it seems to dry your skin out instead of putting moisture back in
i find it drying actually.
make them water until i wash it off
this is definitely not the same as the old hope in a jar for dry skin
unfortunately they discontinued hope in a jar dry skin formula
something about this formula causes it to pill up on my face
greasy after having it on
does not sink in well
i also feel it's made my skin oily which never used to happen i have dry to normal skin
it doesn't absorb very well
you can't just dab your finger in the container to get product out
it is difficult to apply and gets in your eyes.
i would really like a gel instead.
it did absolutely nothing for my dryness
i did not find it to hydrate my under eye area at all
seems like it would benefit my sometimes dry skin
i don't see it's moisturized enough when i put it on every night
it feels like it just lays on top of your skin rather than sink in
now i know to go for lighter creams instead even for my dry skin
this also tends to leave on some type of residue after applying which i hated
definitely try a sample first especially when it comes to eye creams because they are tricky to shop for
besides that, the balm is thick and sort of dry.
other than just providing the skin with moisture this eye cream doesn't do much
doesn't pump up my fine lines
i don't think it did more for my skin than the ultra repair cream
for my dry eye area it didn't to much.
does not provide the moisture i need.
if you even touch your under eye after applying this it will pill up
if they fixed the texture
i find it's much nicer to apply after another serum or face oil
no matter how little i use its impossible to rub completely into my skin
it also seems to flake off whatever sits under it
it makes me want to rewash my face after using it
unless you count feeling like an oil slick as a result
this just doesn't absorb well
of course my hair ends up getting greasy around my face
this didn't break me out or make my somewhat oily face any worse
i felt as if dust or hair on my face
but was too heavy for my skin type.
even using very little i just feel greasy.
my skin did have a nice even texture after using it
i've tried other face oils without that issue
just not oily skin i guess
i don't even have oily skin.
i saw some pretty good results each time i used them either mixing them together or just using one serum separately or one serum mixed in my eye cream or face cream
the chlorella doesn't seem to be irritating me at all
i would have expected the vitamin a to be a bit irritating
the mixing of the products was a complete mess because it was so thick
it doesn't even fill the bottle
it doesn't matter whether i use a brush or a sponge
i would recommend this only for a bare
dried it really bad that my skin felt like s
i like that there is spf in the primer
i am not oily at all
it's just sitting on my mantle as an irritating reminder that i should stay away from skincare br
even the slightest sweat will mess with your makeup when this is your base
with combo oily t-zone and dry everywhere else.
beware it does not dissipate for quite some time
with it being on your face it is all up in your nostrils to stay
maybe you can stomach this if you have dry skin
it didn't feel heavy or gross on my skin
little chunks of anything on your face is just gross
hopefully not get pilling
although it did keep me looking very matte all day
it also seemed to dry out my skin.
when you apply foundation on top the product starts to peel or something weird
i don't even use it without makeup because i live in a very warm place
if i use these product it makes me feel oily
i find that if i touch my face at all it has a tendency to pill up
if not more oily
which always feel dry
i'll occasionally use this as a primer before i put my foundation on
after that i'm basically an oily mess
need to use quite a dollop on my face
it does not provide enough moisture to my skin
i could see an oily person enjoying it more
i also feel like too much comes out of the tube because it's runny
either way i was still just as oily as normal
seemed like it made my makeup more slick in my t-zone
a bit sticky when you touch it
cool on your face when you apply it
it doesn't leave an oily film on your face
the hot humid weather would be perfect to test this with
doesn't work to mattifier my oily skin at all.
this product made my skin beyond oily
i found if i used too little it made me very dry
if i used just a tad more i'd end up being a grease ball so this was a no go for me
it doesn't seem to help my oily skin at all.
i felt like it left me looking more oily compared to me not wearing a moisturizer at all
made me more oily
however it doesn't last long at all to keep my oily skin at bay
find that within an hour i need to either reapply or blot my skin
didn't really reduce oil, at all.
seriously within a couple of hours i looked like a grease slick
no difference at all to my oily skin
did nothing to help with my oiliness.
i've never experienced such grease on my skin before
unfortunately this made me even more oily around my t-zone
just not oil control
unfortunately this made me feel like i had plastic wrap on my face
my skin couldn't breathe at all.
this was almost too drying
nothing can keep the oil at bay all day
i am oily going to bed if i use it!
i also do not think the product is very moisturizing as i would still have some dry patches around my nose
stuff this cleanser is supposed to be good at taking care of
i wanted one for dry skin
if any gets in your eyes it burns severely
now im chapped so far amorepacific is not doing anything to my skin
the product didn't dry quick enough
this product did nothing except perhaps dry my eye area up
do not dry your skin
this wouldn't absorb on my face at all.
especially with warm weather
actually appear oily which is rare for me
the hassle of getting the moisture from the product is too frustrating
for very dry skin it doesn't do much
for oily skin it will make your face look ever oilier
i would definitely recommend this for dry/combination skin
it did seem to hydrate the skin to a point my face was like an oil field every day after using it
over time it did cause a lot of texture
got this as a sample since it gets pretty windy/cold
oily or combo it may not be the best
it feels a little heavier than some other "deep moisture" creams
unfortunately that was not the case it made my dry patches red
the dry patches would not let
way too greasy, doesn't work for normal skin.
if u have dry skin this will be too drying.
my skin just felt so dry after using this
it's really difficult to completely rinse off
guess i'll keep searching for a new wash
for me it's going to end up being another body wash
unfortunately i did not enjoy having to rinse the "water" off
sometimes i would have mascara residue under my eyes in the morning
it was also drying on my skin so this was a fail for me
sometimes my skin would feel tight/dry even after putting it on
i usually have fairly normal skin with a tendency to become oily if not taken care of
my makeup seems to break up much faster
however my skin can
it said its for extra dry skin
i wouldn't consider it to be for dry skin
it definitely doesn't provide a "deep moist" for me as it advertises
i get a lot of dry patches
my only problem is how oily it makes me.
it doesn't seem to help at all with oiliness
not really meant for oily skin
as it can leave a greasy residue
i figured that it would be perfect for my oily skin
my dermotologist told me to stop using it because this formula is not good for anyone due to one of its main ingredient being denature alcohol which is bad for your skin
i felt as if this made me even more oily
it makes it appear as though you get 2-3 times the amount of moisturizer than you actually get
leaves a thing oily layer that i don't like
at night it is great because when i get up my face look really moisturized
aqua bomb does not provide enough moisture for my dry skin
even in warm weather
it made my t-zone so oily
i always think put alcohol on your skin is bad
it's better have my natural oil on my skin then having alcohol to dry my skin out
i can see it work for an oily skin probably
this is not for dry skin
however if you have dry
dehydrated skin don't like the words on the package fool you
it also peels off my face if i accidentally touch my face during the day + no hydration whatsoever
it could be because of the toner
it doesn't peel away easily with water as promised
s of it very easily get stuck in my hair as it is "peeling" away
it absolutely does not peel off
it is like a gel mask that you then have to sort of scrape off your face
it didn't peel off for me at all
i've never had to wait for a mask to dry
i don't like the hassle of adding water back on
you got to wet the mask again once its dry.
i don't notice much difference as far as pore-refining or being especially moisturized
this says that it will get rid of dark spots
however-----i have to wash my skin 4x with at least 12 pumps to get 75% of my makeup off
in fact i almost felt like it left it drier than when i just used my regular moisturizer
this eye cream was too oily for daily use.
i live in a very dry climate
no matter how waterproof it is
it might work for oilier skin
so does any cheaper cream
how it dried out my skin so much
it did nothing for moisture :
it does absorb quickly and easy to apply.
for an eye cream that does nothing
because my face isn't parched
i don't get as oily
may also break your skin out
which is weird because i have oily skin
it was too oily
also don't add fuel to the fire/dry out my skin even more
my skin doesn't absorb it well
it's wayyyyy too drying even for my oily skin.
my skin has never been so dry
the other mud cleansers they carry do a much better job of that
do this in the shower
it can be a little drying
also the clay always runs out before the oil which is annoying
it says to use it on dry skin which i did
i also tried it on wet skin in case that would help with the sensitivity
also not dry me out entirely
it didn't help my oily breakout prone skin at all
t naturally takes a bit more to spread over the face
it didn't really help my blackhead problem either
not that much of the mud
i think that is too much for a morning cleanser only
i don't feel like 3-4 pumps of the mud is enough to effectively clean my face
it also was quite drying on my already dry skin
this may be better for someone with oily or combination skin
maybe a little dry in some areas sometimes
my face feels like i,ve washed it with glue.
everytime i used this one sticky sgain
i didn't find that it cleansed my face
i tried it on dry
it dries my skin up whenever i don't use it.
maybe oils are not for me.
i felt as if the oil didn't absorb in my skin
the dry areas are still dry
since you just wipe it off the cent is there until you wash
it doesn't absorb into the skin very well
i think if you can wear this with some powder
it doesn't disappear for a while
dry spots whatsoever who are using it for its mattifying effect
i think this is a great option for normal-oily skin types only if you apply to dry skin
f you're one of those people who is too lazy to moisturize i'd recommend this
if you enjoy putting white paste on your face that just sits on it this is the product for you
i can't even get through the jar
it is really drying
perhaps best for those with oily skin
accentuates any dry areas/lines that you may have
this may be a better product for someone with oily skin
after using it daily for several weeks returned it because not only did it not moisturize well it totally dried out
i can't get past the fact that it leaves my face looking white
when applied it actually leaves a bit of a while cast on your face
first, this is not for dry skin.
however people should know that sunscreen in a jar is going to be exposed to light
it doesn't really absorb in as much as sit on top of your skin
this stuff is way too thick, like toothpaste.
if your skin is normal
can't imagine how it is for any deeper skin tones
just never seems to sink in no matter how much you pat or rub or warm up beforeh
totally would recommend to those with super dry skin
i myself do not have extremely dry skin
i would use strictly as sunscreen if your skin does not need an abundance amount of hydration
it takes for ever to rub in
run down your face if you are even a tiny bit sweaty
you have to rub it in for a long time
i don't like taking the time to rub it in
doesn't absorb very well into the skin
personally i don't think its necessary to wear an spf 40 product everyday unless you're going to be in the sun for an extended period of time like at the beach
can make you feel slightly greasy
formula is way too thick.
it wouldn't go away even after massaging
it doesn't want to absorb into my skin
it just made my face feel dry as though i didn't put moisturizer on at all
i think my skin might be too dry for it
it sweats out very very easily
doesn't keep me oil free throughout the day
it can feel thick
i am not sure i would substitute this for my daily moisturizer in the summer because it was very thick
i still need to wear a moisturizer for my dry-ish skin type to not let this get flaky by mid-day
by the end of the day my face is basically melting off because it makes my combo skin super greasy
at least for my dry skin
couldn't get past the unpleasant tingling that happened with my skin immediately
i applied with a extra foundation brush not sure if it was too thick
while my skin looked better after use it left my skin very tight amd dry which is something i never experience with any type of mask
this product dries way out way too much.
not only does it flake off
i do not have sensitive skin especially when it's warmer out my skin is my oily than anything
it didn't pull anything out of my pores my blackheads are all still there
i wouldn't recommend it to anyone since rinsing it off stripped my face of any moisture to be gained
it doesn't get hot but it does get a little warm.
i did not feel any sort of warmth until i started to rinse off
i do like the way it cleanses your face.
i found it really dried out my skin
i do like how fast it gets soapy.
i find it a little drying for my skin
its very light almost like water.
f you do happen to spill it not so much of the product spills out :
would be great for someone with dry skin
that is how my skin is after every face oil
there just wasn't enough hydration on its own
prefer to have a little more hydration in the oil itself
i agree with the reviewer that said this mask feels like bugs crawling on your face
when i washed it off it just made my skin feel smooth
my friends the product made my face a little dryer that's about it
if i apply too much around my nose i can actually see little beads of oil forming around my pores
it didn't do much for the dry skin on my forehead
the price is ridiculous though--there are a lot of other thick face creams at sephora that are only half the price of this repair cream
just not for my skin
even with no make up or any moisturizer on top
doesn't make me feel or look oily
i won't even finish the jar.
moisturizer-wise it did not clog my pores or anything
i didn't notice any results except that i don't think this mask is the best for my dry skin that isn't acne prone
you had to literally scrub it off
it doesn't dry out your skin
it just didn't do anything on my skin except for drying it out
it doesn't do anything except for some exfoliating effects that come with any clay mask
its was way too drying for my skin
i would not recommanded for dry skin.
one bonus is that it doesn't dry out my skin badly
dry out all my skin
found it to be a little too harsh for my dry
i didn't really like it my skin felt really heavy afterwards i didn't feel like it peeled anything because i still had skin peeling on my face
it couldn't reduce my breakouts- didn't tighten pores- didn't help even my skin tonehopefully it shows some results after further application
it did nothing to clear up my pores or dry up the pimples i had
i don't think it cleared my pores as well as other products
i still would like to try the instant detox mask when i get around to it
it didnt do a good job of clearing my skin i even got more blemishes
after i rinse i can definitely feel a difference in my skins texture
will not give you that dried out or tight feeling that other purifying masks will
it even kind of curdles if you wear it longer than a couple minutes
since it never really dries i can't figure it out
only if i get super dry skin
this is just too drying for me
at least it doesn't feel like you'll peel your face off
could apply just to my nose
have to really work at cleaning it off
tend to like to use oils on drier days
this one was too thick for me
or till you wash it off
i am in my twenties with somewhat of sensitive dehydrated combination skin if that can give you an idea of my skin type
i think this oil is great for drier skin or like that really hydrating/heavy moisturizer feel if you're like me
not greasy like you haven't washed your face
for a while after application if your skin is like mine
i don't think it will be good under makeup since it feels a bit slippery
i like this oil a lot
if your skin is like like mine
unfortunately it did not penetrate my dry
i feel that the oil is simply too rich for me
very heavy face oil, doesn't absorb.
i found this oil to be very thick
its starting to get warmer here
i slather them on in the winter
it reminds me of s drug store lotion that had been sitting on the shelf too long
it is slightly sticky if you use as a night mask
felt that this product would be better suited for someone with drier skin then mine
it actually dried my face out
it does have a nice gel like glide when you apply it
it's super hard to rinse off my face
i can tell it removes everything because my cotton ball of toner is still completely clear after washing my face
i know there is still residue there.
i still notice some makeup residue afterwards when i apply toner
i can find plenty of residue with a swipe of micellar water afterwards
which i feel takes away from the moisturizing effectsoverall: i will continue to use this from time to time
it doesn't feel so greasy that i feel like i need to wash my face again
what little eye makeup is left on my face comes right off when i use a q tip or cotton ball to wipe at it after cleansing because the product won't fully cleanse off
i imagine this would be great for very dry skin types
i don't recommend this for dry or mature skin
normal to oily folks would probably enjoy this
it made my face too tight and dry.
i would rather stick with a regular cleanser that doesn't weigh on my skin
you need a separate cleanser for your eyes since instructions say to keep it away from your eyes
it doesn't lather at all
i would only recommend this possibly as a regular cleanser for someone with dry
it didn't work to control my oil
my face is so oily i'm usually super shiny by 10:00 a
it's the worst product i've ever tried for oily skin
isn't moisturizing in the least if you try to avoid the thick feeling
but it doesn't absorb fast at all.
didn't absorb into the under eye skin fast enough
it would be better in a humid climate.
fall i find my eye skin feels dry
the stick get's really dirty looking
in order to actually wash your face with it you will need to continually wet your h
s or it gets dry
you can't rub it around
or just do it in the shower
apply to skin when your face is dry though
i always felt like i need to rewash my face after every use
their wasn't any kind of change with my pores.
if anything it just dried out my skin.
i don't get a lather when i use this
using this during a dry spell for my skin just isn't working for me
i'll try again in the summer when my skin tends to be oilier
the stick applied the product unevenly: very thick or nothing at all
it was so melted that it wouldn't roll up anymore
it doesn't feel super clean like i would expect it to when it's washed off
have to scrape this expensive stuff out of the bottom of the container
you are supposed to wet your face
plus application on wet skin does not work properly
if you try it on dry skin however you end up getting tons of product on your face
apply this to a wet face
i now apply to my dry face
if you use it in the shower
it indeed creates a huge mess when wet
in fact it does a good job taking out the blackheads in my nose
maybe then it would lather?
use a lot of water first.
it left my skin with a sticky feeling no matter how much or how little i used
makes it dry quickly
not for 50 dollars though i can get the same refreshment splashing water on my face
when i'm done my skin is just as thirsty as before i've applied it
this product is so light weight i might as well try to splash water on my face
more like it just dries on your skin
i always go through face cream so fast
better for very oily people.
not get creasy or shiny
my skin is so sensitive it broke me out :/ love how cooling
it just sort of felt like putting smelly water on my face
i am not dry so of course this does not dry me out
and i don't even have dry skin.
i agree with other reviewers that it leaves a slight tacky feel on the face
until you put honey on your skin
the stickiness did not lend itself to playing nicely with my other cosmetics
you would be good except that it lacks sunscreen
it does not sink into the skin well
does not feel like it absorbs.
has a light sheen from where the oil did not absorb well
tacky even after washing it off
my face had an oily/tacky film both days
one day i kept wondering why my face smelled of latex
i know people will say "that's just it bringing impurities to the surface"
i don't find that it helped with any discoloration nor did it brighten my face
it didn't brighten or exfoliate my face the way i thought it would
this is so not for oily girls.
whatever results i get are lost despite sunscreen
it was like trying to wash beach s
so far all i can say is these are just really good cleansing wipes
unfortunately the smell of the wipes bothered him so much that he only used it one or two times
my pores just might be too big for this little mask to h
another minus was that this mask really dried out my skin
i think people with sensitive skin should avoid this mask
putting on some cream i definitly noticed how smooth my skin is
how drying this is to my normal/dry skin
it doesn't make my skin dry or irritate it
it does make your skin more tight
my skin didn't look much better in the way of pore size or texture after using
tho i must admit my skin did feel soft after i washed off the mask
so don't fall for the pretty pink color or the fact that it has rose in it like i did
maybe a good idea for more oilier skins?
while i don't have really bad eyes skin
you only need to use a tiny bit or else it'll leave your undereye saggy
i found it does nothing other than hydrate my under eyes
after putting it on in the mornings the application would dry my under eyes making my face look like i did not wash my face
within days the skin under my eyes was so dried out i couldn't continue to use it
it's very dry going on--it comes out in little balls
it took some getting used to at first because i found it to be a thicker moisturizer than what i typically use
i just don't like the thickness of this for daytime use especially for someone like me who spends a lot of time walking about
it is so greasy
just made my skin even more oily
may work for someone with drier skin
they made my face super greasy
it fixed a pretty bad dry patch on my nose after being paired with my first aid beauty moisturizer
for storage i started freaking out until i remembered i had leftover lush sample pots which work
f you have the little lush storage pots i recommend using them bc they can fit a good 2-3 packets of the overnight stuff
this was so sticky
after applying my skin was a bit sticky until it fully dried
they were all sticky
all this did was give me a ton of whiteheads
it did hydrate the dry parts of my combination skin which was good
they are also sticky so not very comfortable to sleep in unless you sleep on your back all night
my skin was extra oily throughout the day
it would stay wet longer
it did seem to clear up my skin a little
chances are you have oily skin
which will dry out your skin
they exploit your love for a matte finish
they are horrible for your skin
i always have residue.
sometimes just feels like a waste of product because it completely drips off the face if your face is already wet with water
the smell i literally try to hold my breath while i wash my face
it isn't the best cleansing oil out there
i feel like i am putting gasoline on my face.
if anything it smears all over
for some reason makes my skin feel a bit drier than it should
i think if the producer toned the perfume way down that would help a lot
i think this product is a decent face wash
i keep this in the shower now for when i need a quick face wash
turns out the pump doesn't get out a good 25% of the product
everyone is saying this absorbs quickly in their skin ?
found that it did not absorb into my skin
i first started to use their serum in the line because i love that light non-greasy texture
neither my dry lines seems to go away as well.
while i wanted to love this i am just not willing to rub alcohol all over my tender under eye area
dry if you were to touch it with your h
you can feel it tugging on your skin
i can feel it tighten my pores when i apply it.
s before applying bc i can smell it before it touches my face
so take care if you have very sensitive or reactive skin
i do not have dry skin at all
while it did "ok" on my dry skin
my skin was getting even more dry not better.
it's kinda been dry this winter a little goes a long way i just do a quick tap on the surface
using these products made my skin even more dry
it just didn't help with the patches of flakey skin
does not do much in the way of moisture or hydration
if you wipe a tissue on your skin while having had applied this
also not good for use under makeup because it clumps
all it did was make my face even more dry
will just sit on the surface
doesn't work for undereye area
it did also make my skin under my eyes dry with patches which i wouldn't have minded so much if it took away the wrinkles
it made me look like a complete grease bomb
my foundation turns out patchy on my face because it's so greasy
i find that it also doesn't even help my dry skin at all
now they have become super drying for me
like that it worked more like a dry oil
it also did not give me the hydration i needed for the current dry fall weather
when you put it on it you look like an oil slick.
this one doesn't seem to work on those dry days.
i can feel how sticky it is
not red or dry
more on my dry areas
overall too much for combination oily skin people
maybe because it doesn't moisturize that much my skin got drier
i even tried reapplying, and nothing.
it was far too sticky
however i wouldn't say this product completely gets rid of dry skin forever
i think this might be better suited for oily skin
if i used too much it left a residue on my face
if i combined it with my usual moisture cream it was pretty good
actually made my dry skin drier
didn't absorb at all.
the other almost feels greasy going on
meaning it won't work well at blocking uva
it makes my eyes water like crazy
although it didn't always give me as much moisture as my face needed
you will find a sticky surface if you use it minimally
not really enough for my dry skin
it didn't break me out or cause irritation
what i couldn't get over was the stickiness
you really have to wash your h
on top of it being so sticky since it is a balm everytime i would go to use it somehow so much is missing when i've barely used any
it was too sticky
it was still sticky
had to use a lot of product to get any kind of moisture
if i used too much it made me completely oily
this will only make you feel full on oily
it doesn't sit well under make up because it's sticky to the touch
i like how my skin feels after i rinse it off in the am
my face has dried up so much because of it i get flaky patches
like many others said it leaves your face sticky
some parts wouldn't even dry at all
throughout the day if you touch your face it still feels sticky
since it gives you just enough moisture so that your skin doesn't dry
doesn't do anything except leave my skin feeling sticky
not really too dry or sinsitive
so oils are usually a good bet for me
because i get better moisture from it
i don't think people with oily skin will like the gel consistency of it
it was so sticky
it left a kind of sticky film on my face
they said it was for dry skin.
but it might for oily skin.
perfect for the warmer weather outside
maybe it would be better for those with combo/oily skin types?
roll up on the skin if you apply too much by accident
it may be i'm trying to massage it into my skin overmuch
after the sticky smell goes away your face actually looks better
save your buck for some more worthy eye creams
if you put too much on your skin will crease
i prefer a product that i can use undereye as well as on my lids
i didn't find that it provided enough moisture
although it applies kind of thick like
it has a nice cooling feeling when applied
couldn't deal with my eyes watering
i think i may try this again as a regular eye cream for hydration
it just ok, and it sort of evaporates... i sure!
i only use it in the daytime under my makeup as i don't feel it's thick enough for night time
for my dry skin this did not do the trick
i found it to be the opposite-very drying.
it might work on the dryness a bit since it's winter now
i feel like my skin got more dry by then end of the day
i hoped it would do a great job of hydrating my facial skin however i found that this did not moisturize nor did it make my skin look healthy
some people with oily skin may do fine with it
i do tend to wake up in the morning with my skin feeling a little dry
make my face feel like an oil slick
if your skin is prone to drying out easily i'd avoid this
drys your skin so badly.
i didn't notice any "mask" effects after letting it dry then washing it off
i would hardly say it foamed at all
doesn't dry it out like most masks
i did not like the white clay at all
everyone of them dried my skin out so bad
if they weren't so drying i would have kept them as i did quite like how they toned the redness down in my skin
the consistency of this product is very creamy if you're into that
definitely stay away from it if you have sensitive of dry skin
second time using it it does feel very drying on the skin al
perhaps it would be better on combo/oily skin.
regular use is just too harsh on my sensitive
my initial reaction is that it can be a little drying on the skin
it will dry out your skin.
very sticky and does nothing for my dry skin.
feel like i put oil mixed with honey on my face
however the serum inside is just so so.
it was too sticky
did not firm or plump my skin at all
this doesn't hydrate my skin as much as i hoped it would for the price
though i really like the feel of the serum i would not buy it again due to the dropper packaging
it does not work to draw up serum
the eye dropper does not work at all.
thinking that i would notice the "film" less under my liquid foundation
this will help retain your skin's moisture if your face tends to be dry after showers though
when i used this on my face it felt like i was applying acid
even after serum i find myself putting two layers of this moisturizer on to feel like i have an adequate amount for the day
unfortunately it give me a lots of itch
some of my eye masks did a better job cooling the skin around my eye area without even have to sit in the fridge at all
doesn't irritate the eyes or travel
did make me much more oily
more things burn my skin
it doesn't sink in well
every time you use it you have to fool with unscrewing the cap
trying to rethread the cap is a real treat when your eyes are on fire
it's still very heavy enough to clog some pores in my t zone
it stings a bit when i put it on after scrubbing
except for the scented items that i am usually ok with
however once the weather became more humid
my skin could only tolerate using it perhaps once or twice a week or i'd see some clogged pores
this was very drying
i recently learned that it contains dimethicone which causes impurities to build up so maybe thats why it didn't work for me
would be great for someone who has oily skin
isn't heavy enough for combination or dry skin
it doesn't get greasy at all
i do like this moisturizer because it is one of the few that don't make my face like an oil-slick by noon
i always feel like i need just a little bit more of something else for my skin to feel really moisturized
that's due to the ceramidine yet i am missing that satisfying full hydrating feel i usually get with other products
not enough to make my parched skin happy
don't rub too hard, it pills right off.
it doesn't dry out my dry skin
it does an okay job of removing any oil residue
however the heavy oils seem to break me out.
it does not lather well
it did not lather well.
i don't find it to offer much more hydration than the cucumber mask
the winter is drying my skin out badly
it leaves my face slightly sticky when i wash it off
i don't feel any burning or tingling like others
once you wash it off
may be good for those with oily skin only.
when i buy a mask i expect it to give me some extra moisture that my moisturizer would not give me
this mask did not deliver any moisture for my dry skin at all
each time i get the same result: sticky
as it was too sticky
it does not go evenly on the skin
even if you are careful to put on a very thin layer
off skin if you so much as touch it to spread it
when it drys it becomes all dry n crummy
i chose this as a hundred point perk because i wanted a nice thick lotion for winter
even applying it at night time it rubs off so easily
when you rub your skin adter a while of applying it
i washed it off because the sticky film was so annoying to me
once it dries it balls up if you happen to smooth your finger over your face
i personally found that i couldn't use it over a serum without it balling up
it might work for some people with dry skin
like other reviews i too experienced the product "balling up" if i rubbed it in too long or applied makeup
i even thought it might be a cleanser needing washed off it was so tacky
moisture was nothing special
not in a rich night cream kind of way
more like my skin couldn't breathe through it
lightly work it n2 my skin
sticky surface on my face that didn't go away even under makeup
it seems like every time i brush my face
it didn't absorb into my skin at all.
this does not absorb into the skin
then make you look like your skin is peeling off
i too would get the flaking
especially for a day cream that doesn't contain spf
especially after seeing other reviewers say that it doesn't sink into the skin very quickly
tried in the summertime and it doesn't absorb.
otherwise i didn't mind the smell or texture when applying it
this product does not absorb into my skin.
this cream did not irritate me
there are plenty of other moisturizers i've tried that really made my skin feel beautiful for around the same price
it was very thick but it did spread well.
it remained white as if i put soap directly on my skin
it felt like my skin didn't absorb any of it
the smell is stopping me from reapplying the thing on my face anytime soon
i love any kind of product that can hydrate
this did absolutely nothing for my skin other than cause my t-zone to way overproduce oil within the next 30 min to an hour
i think that's a clear sign that this product is not balancing the skin or actually nourishing it
i felt i needed more moisture
never dries even after make up application
throughout the day my t zone got so shiney even my powder wasn't really helping for longer than an hour
this product is probably great if you have extremely dry skin
i don't like how it makes my skin look dry after application
i still looks oily even after applying it.
i wanted this for the drier areas of my face
it is oily as all anything
while it did help my dry skin
it dries my skin like anything i've tried before
just terrible for dry skin.
this bar was very drying on my skin
maybe its the water here
this soap is very drying for my skin to the point you can see the dead white skin on my arms
this dries out my skin too much
after drying myself i couldn't smell anything at all
i noticed a bit too late that this contains coconut oil
i find that it doesn't absorb that great into my skin
though it does hydrate to some extent
i find it takes a lot of rubbing
sometimes if i don't spend the required 10 mins rubbing it in
not as an oil slick like it was when i used it
this would be a good face oil if you are looking only for mild hydration
even it says doesn't clog your skin
i did get acnes from it
it doesn't like any type of oils.
on the lighter side because it does absorb very quickly
i found the oil to be too heavy for my skin
t would not drip over everything
found that to be annoying- since i don’t like to be completely incapacitated when i use a face mask
not to a greater extent than a good foaming face wash or good old egg whites
i can take a little burn
when it dries it's like hard jelly impossible to get off
i do wish it came with a spatula or in a tube rather than a jar
i just feel like it's easier to become contaminated
i love that they included a spatula so you did not contaminate the product over repeated uses
it did add moisture to my under eye area
maybe if you have oily skin ?
i don't notice any difference with the eye dew
it did absolutely nothing for my dry under eyes
it also left a sticky feeling on my skin after i applied
it's not very easy to absorb into the skin
so hard to swallow so after too much overthinking
i prefer non-jar so not to stick my finger in each time
didn't have the dry feeling
makes me think something in cream was drying out my skin
don't need much moisture
maybe it is better for oily skin?
you have to rub it in very quickly as it dries quickly
the formula also takes awhile to fully absorb into the skin
it smells so badly that i wouldn't even use it as a foot cream
i feel like i used bacon grease on my face due to the smell
i always dreaded putting on the serum because it smells so bad
s smell bad truly for the entire day until i wash my face
it turns to be really sticky to me
too dry, too bad.
now honestly i could have put up with the unpleasant smell if it made my skin glow
it would look patchy even if waiting a few minutes for it to dry first
probably better for normal or oily skin as this made my skin super dry
it doesn't provide enough moisture to my very dry skin
did nothing for my dry skin
which i try to stay away from because my skin is sensitive
maybe for oily skin will work !
i got it with high hopes that it would help my dry skin in this dry arizona weather
immediately washed my face which felt super dry
leaves my already dry skin even more dry
and it doesn't clean at all!
feels like i'm just putting on foam
i don't really feel like it gets deep down in the pores to clean them out because the consistency is too whipped
his oily skin didn't improve at all
it does not clean your skin
the only things this soap has going for it are the scent
i never felt like it had actually cleaned my skin as much as stripped it
it might work for someone with sensitive skin
i need more of a deep clean because of my oily/combination skin
a lot of foam comes out at a time
i didn't feel cleansed at all
•i don't think is doing any change for my skin complexion which i thought it would since the foam is gentle
i would still go over with my soap
even though the mousse feels nice against your skin when you first apply
it doesn't feel like it is really cleansing your pores
this product is so foamy that it is hard to massage into your face
it was a good product, but it dried my face.
i felt that it did not fully cleanse my skin as it's so light on my face
doesn't leave my face tight or dry
does a poor job at taking make up off which leads me to believe it doesn't get surface dirt off either with how little make up i was wearing that day
when i use this product my face just doesn't feel clean or well moisturized
f you have sensitive skin be careful
it's a foam that feels nice like any other mouse
other then a little bit moisture it does nothing
if you are looking into wasting a few dollars to get a fun frizzy feeling when applying on
when you put it on it almost feels like bubbles are popping on your face which feels really cool
this item isn't worth buying due to the face that it's just a foamy mask that doesn't dry your skin
i love the thick foam consistency which was very different from any other mask i have tried
i definitely don't like how dry my skin feels
it doesn't lift nor firm my skin
i basically have started to use eye creams just to prevent all that
especially as my skin feels dried out again immediately after washing it off
not sure if it works for my deep wrinkles
this balm might work for some
i feel like some of the product is wasted in a tube
wear sunscreen because no lie without it you will burn
it did not lighten or even my skin tone.
it has a sticky feel to it which is fine with my for nighttime
like drunk elephant or skinceutials if you have sensitive
i tend to stay out of the sun anyway
i generally don't use scrubs because they're too harsh on my sensitive skin
you're washing away all the good stuff
unfortunately murad hasn't rid their entire line of sulfates
i guess it could be nice for a light scrub
didn't have to keep adding water to it to make it gentle enough for me
did dry my skin out plus it says you should use this everyday
i would probably suggest this one for normal to normal dry skin type
i just assumed i wouldn't see any foundation on the cotton pad after washing my face with this stuff
i could even see residue from left over foundation on my skin
flaky which is what i was trying to avoid by using an oil cleanser in the first place
this is so stick just like a glue.
it also seems to get pretty sticky once applied
maybe most oils are like this
not be so much "work" to use because the cleansing milk is easy
it did not turn milky at all
kind of made my face super dry
i find i need to at least splash water on my face after to relieve it
know the irritation can be attri
i believe that this product does wonders for someone with overly oily skin with lots of acne
if your skin is combo
this product dried me out
i didn't feel like my skin was super clean after because it's a very gel like texture that doesn't lather
after one use my face is as dry as a desert with the texture of s
while my face is not oily it is so red
it's so drying that i have to return it
it dries my face out so much that my face is literally stiff after i use it
however it is doing wonders for my oily skin
i won't say my acne is totally under control after using this
it didn't dry out my skin
therefore, did not experience much drying.
tingly like it's really doing some cleaning of my pores while i'm washing my face with it
of course the cleanser didn't make it worse
this product is too drying.
it took too long for me to get the moisture back in my skin
i used this wash until the end because it was expensive
somehow it dried me out
maybe it does a good job at keeping acne at bay
it didn't even diminish them or dry them
this makes my face so dry i keep breaking every day
only the occasional breakout if i've been eating too much fast food or too tired to wash my face the night before
while i can see it working for those with oilier skin types
this product really dried out my skin
it actually dried out my skin
i do think it's the vinegar helping my skin so much
can be a bit drying
especially if you tend to have dry skin
see if it helps my skin at all overnight
it doesn't dry my skin the way it did other customers'
if anything i got dryer looking
this might work on bare skin
it did mean that taking off the makeup with it was a bit uncomfortable
i feel like i need to wash my face again with the slip cleanser
would rather just wash my face than use this
don't feel comfortable using it around my eyes which is a big reason i choose a cleansing balm
it doesn't take away my skin's natural oils
i don't know if it was due to this or switching up moisturizers
a lot more than what does with my normal cleansing routine
which surprised me because every balm i've tried is completely smooth
i like balms that turn into a oil as you rub them into your face
i personally prefer a good micellar water to a balm these days anyway
my skin does not react well to coconut oil
i would use a hot
it was too oily
even with adding water to make it milky my skin felt like it was suffocating
this eye cream did not have any lifting effect on my lids
doesn't feel like most sunscreen-containing products--which is a great thing to me
unless i wear it alone, it pills badly.
it makes me look like a greasy hot dog
doesn't work on oily skin they give you barely any in the bottle as it is
this product did not leave my skin matte or blurred or primed i have oily skin
i still have dry
make sure you have a thick enough layer
need to get rid of excess oil
i feel like my drug store micellar water does a way better job
it also comes with a little sponge which was hard as a rock when i got it
i actually have to use another cleanser to get all the residue off of my face
it doesn't rinse off as clean as i would like.
i don't recommend this to anyone with oily skin.
which never happens unless it's humid
it didn't dry out my skin
it didn't brighten either
it dries up very quickly on the face so you end up using a lot more
not too had it is comes out in a glob
it was still too sticky for me to leave on after using my nuface
there is flakes of gold in it that is suppose to brighten your skin
the only advantage i see to this gel is the fact you don't have to wash it off
maybe soaks in a little too much
it feels like sticky milk.
what's even worse is that it smells like sewer water
this didn't seem to penetrate my skin
