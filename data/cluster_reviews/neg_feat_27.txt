i don't notice a reduction in redness
didn't notice any particular hydratation or calming sensation on my skin
it wasn't extremely noticeable
it was noticeable nonetheless
it also felt heavy.
the only positive thing was the smell
has no effect on my skin
i noticed that the skin in my cheeks was softer
i've seen no difference in dryness whatsoever
there was no difference in my dark circles or lines
the product was causing flareups
i dont know if this is due to the silver pigment or some conflicting oil in the mask
with the others you see a noticeable difference afterwards
i felt it tightening my skin
this seems like it was more designed for mature skin with visible wrinkles
not even obvious dead skin
i personally didn't notice any firming or tightening in my skin
it did not leave visible burn on my skin overall
doesn't have any adverse effects on my skin
somehow after this mask i experienced what appeared to be a minor couple blemishes appear
it did somewhat clear my pores
plus is changes color
it had no affect on the texture of my skin.
no reduction in the appearance of pores
i don't notice any visible difference with my skin texture
haven't noticed any benefits
there was no reduction in redness which was my reason for purchase
i just didn't noticed a huge difference
have not seen a difference in fine lines or firmness
then i started noticing that my cheeks were more bumpy than usual
this serum for some reason caused it to get worse
after the initial application i noticed how greasy my face felt
did not deliver any discernible benefits
even the shape should be altered to more of a rounded oval than a big rectangle block
haven't noticed any difference in the surface of my face
there is a definite scent to the product
without visibly reducing fine lines
this made no difference in my fine lines
this product makes no difference on my skin
i don't see any noticeable difference
haven't noticed any difference
though i haven't noticed any reduction in aging
on the positive side
it tightens skin noticeably
have not noticed a difference in my skin texture or a in wrinkles
it did have a very slight cooling feeling after it was applied
i don't see any changes or brightening under my eyes
notice my fine lines were deeper
no significant change over a longer time period
it literally made no difference
every fine line was exaggerated
haven't noticed any changes in my eye area
i see no visible effects
i don't see anything noticeable or 'have to have' about it
have noticed some brightening
i did not see any visible repairing effects
i can't say i saw a huge difference in terms of puffiness
even in the smallest dose unfortunately this cream was greasy for my normal skin
wasn't expecting any adverse effects
it does have a slight tingling sensation so hopefully that means it's working
actually there is no change around my eye area
nothing beneficial has happened
i noticed my skin was smoother
have not noticed much change at all
i definitely saw a smoothing/filling effect
i saw no change
with little to no wrinkles other than a "1" versus an "11" between my brows
they are only very noticeable when i smile
it actually accentuated these wrinkles
make the line appear worse
noticed a slight softening of lines
have seen no improvement of any kind
i saw no improvement
i saw a review for this concerning lip lines.
see no effect whatsoever
unfortunately after 1 week of daily use i have noticed 0 improvement
lessening of wrinkles or anything
there would be something slight
the effect is noticeable
this just magnified all the issues i'm uncomfortable with
actually made my minor lines look worse
i noticed a slight improvement with my under eye bags
the only downfall is that it irritated my skin a bit
noticed not the slightest improvement after 4 days
i realize it takes much longer for a product to show significant improvement
in fact i've noticed some new tiny blemishes in places i don't usually have them
this product did not change the appearance of my fine lines or wrinkles
haven't seen any results
i do see some aging differences in my skin
have seen no difference
my under eye lines havent even slightly diminished :-
honestly i have seen no visible changes.
cons-no noticeable effects.
haven't noticed any "resurfacing" effect
used it for a weeks w/out any noticeable difference to my skin
after applying to my face i felt dry- no'quenching' that i could discern
in the end results were lacking
an overall more even complexion
the dark circles under my eyes are starting to become less noticeable
definitely softened my skin
after a month i noticed in a magnifying mirror basically every pore seemed clogged
my skin was the same level of congested
have not noticed anything different in my skin
however it made my face
my pores would become clogged creating some slight break outs
i didn't notice any real positive effects from the product
after seeing the praises from people with similar skin
no real difference in skin appearance
my black heads have increases
that are barely noticeable to most people
my fine lines seemed to have disappeared in the puffiness of my skin
i feel like i had the signs of progress early on
the patches although in need of improvement
which just further stressed my problem area
the patches cased my fine lines to be more pronounced
haven't seen any changes at all
i really saw no change in my wrinkles.
i saw no change
the first time i thought it was because i used it over retinal
i've gotten more blemishes on my face
had uneven patches in others
it gets significantly worse
the rubbing of it made it worse
i stopped using this and my skin is improving.
has no scent that i notice
my redness is gone for a little bit
they feel like sharp crystals
i never noticed a difference in my skin.
did not seen an improvement.
i saw no benefits
caused microcuts on my skin
the sugar is so sharp.
i seen a difference in my acne scars after one use
it has a little warming action
really haven't noticed much of a difference in the texture of my face
i didn't find any visible result
notice no difference in my skin
also had no pimples or irritated areas on my face
the fact that is stung
however over time there was no change
first off: the smell is strong, and unpleasant.
second: i did not notice a considerable difference in reduction of pore size or refined skin texture
i noticed i had an increase in clogged pores
my breakouts weren't as calmed/shortened as with luna
haven't noticed any brightening
although i'm fortunate not to have any significant signs of aging yet
gave me a slight tingle
the results was minimal.
i saw no difference in skin.
although i did notice less visible lines
i now have a noticeable black head beside my nose
eye makeup all shifted
the first couple of days i had no issue -- just a slight tingling sensation
it had no cooling effect.
after applying for a couple minutes the area will start to have this noticeable odor that's smells like a mix of fish
it also has a very strange unpleasant smell after sitting on the skin for a few seconds
the amount of acne has remained unchanged
more blemishes had appeared
it just doesn't perform to any noticeable degree
it still had the opposite effect
i don't see a huge difference in the results
i see no difference in the face masks.
noticed no difference in mask performance
i noticed no difference when using this product
it had no effect whatsoever on the performance of the two masks i've tried it with
did notice slight difference when applying the mask
though i haven't really noticed any difference with my masks
after using it a few times i saw no improvements in the quality of the mask other than it helped make application smoother
the benefits of the mask isn't noticeable
i don't see any noticable improvements
polished like their previous skin care line did
the biggest pro of this product for me is that the dry patches on my face seem to be gone by using this
all of a sudden i started having the worst allergic reactions throughout the day
my skin was noticeably softer
after using this for a few days i noticed bigger blackheads
otherwise this had no brightening effects.
it did nothing to brighten my complexion in any way whatsoever
could see if i noticed a difference
made my fine under eye lines more noticeable
uncomfortable tightness feeling on my face
i always had no acne and clear skin.
it made no major change to my skin
i saw no difference
disappointing overall, to say the least.
there is no difference whatsoever.
there is no evidence of it in my pictures
did not notice any dramatic difference in the firmness or minimizing the appearance of my pores
the pamphlet inside didn't make it any clearer
night i have now seen a reduction in lines or pores
noticed zero difference in my ender eye area :
they did not reduce puffiness
no difference in puffiness or wrinkles
i didn't experience any visible brightening or depuffing effects
was hoping to reduce under eye puffiness
see no difference at all
i see an improvement in my dark circles
i really haven't noticed an improvement in hydration after about a week of use
i don't see any major changes with my dark circles or puffiness
haven't noticed any results
this product did nothing to improve under eye circles or puffiness
haven't seen any results
i notice no amazing effects.
no firming, no hydration no nothing.
i saw no difference in my skin whatsoever.
so far this product hasn't done anything special to my face like others have mentioned- it improved my slight forehead wrinkles a little
that is the only positive i'm experiencing
the few pimples i have on my cheek have not improved in appearance
i barely notice a difference in my dark spots.
i notice the dark spots more
more large whiteheads appeared in the morning
my pores were huge
it did not help with the dullness my skin was experiencing
it's unimpressive for my skin
i definitely see no brightening or revitalization in the morning
had definitely dampened the use experience
had no noticeable results
saw some even chunkier
lacked in actual performance
the solid under the cap is slightly underwhelming
it made no difference on my skin when i tried to highlight
have not been able to tell a drastic difference
definitely not for pale people.
i think the glitter is obvious
i didn't notice any difference in the lifting or improvement of my skin
the sun screen seemed to be the major problem.
it hasn't hurt it
to me the texture left different
it has a mild/moderate rose scent that doesn't last too long
this cream changed that!
it caused a lot of redness even for my standards.
issues with redness i would stay clear of it
i my skin felt visible softer
had no blurring effect
unless i notice a huge difference in my skin without it
significantly reduce the appearance of fine lines
as well as in-between my eyebrows
i noticed little to no hydration
i noticed no change in my skin
still saw none of the claims
this also hasn't helped with my problem skin.
this moisturizer had a terrible effect on my skin
after two uses i've noticed this awful
my skin seemed brighter
this one had the opposite effect
except for a feeling of tightening
this product showed me no signs of eye firming or removal of dark circles
no benefits to the skin around the eye
this instantly made it look worse
i see no changes.
there is no observable benefit to using this
at first i thought i was noticing some brighter looking skin
my skin felt tighter
i saw no difference in my skin
it was just an extra step in my skin care with no discernible results
it will show obvious improvement
haven't noticed any significant changes in my skin
the serum itself didn't seem to make any noticeable changes to my skin
can see no marked difference in my skin
since it wasn't showing any difference in my skin
i saw no brightening in my acne scars
no change in texture
that stuff is probably only visible under a special light
poor star rating due to packaging only.
it deserves negative star
my complexion is worse in some ways than before with persistent acne along with clogged
i now have persistent acne
this moisturizer is lackluster
after two days of use i noticed little bumps appearing all over my face as well as pimples
because i found this heavy
i saw little to no difference in brightness with this cream
the smell still lingered
i've seriously seen no results
so on got noticeable clogged
my face also appeared brighter.
after about a week i started noticing little bumps on my chin
did not see any noticeable improvement in my skin
it was a very slight break out
its not that obvious
i saw improvement with my breakouts
deep rooted breakouts that i hadn't been having
the only thing i noticed was that it made my skin feel gross
starting to see the signs of aging
made my breakouts worse
in fact my breakouts increased
am irritated with the price increase
and my unevenness in skin tone was magnified.
have noticed no difference in my skin texture
i did notice some of the fine lines around my eyes reduced
this lightened it a bit
to be honest i haven't seen any difference in dark circles or fine lines
i noticed a difference in her skin texture
i noticed zero difference using this
have not noticed any changes
have not noticed a difference
i liked the cooling effect it has underneath my eyes
recent super dehydrated skin due to travel resulted me in doing just that on a lhr ---> sea flight
for the past month it hasn't done anything for reducing my puffy under eye bags
i don't notice much difference in terms of dark circles or puffiness
do not notice a reduction in dark circles or puffiness
i don't see a huge improvement in the puffiness or the dark circles i have
maybe i can see a reduction in puffiness
perhaps a slight cooling effect on contact
a few sunspots around my eyes
goes patchy over this
this particular product made the skin around my eyes appear thinner thus making my dark circles worse
just to see some improvement
haven`t noticed a difference with dark spots
saw no visible reduction at all in my sun spots
have not seen any significant changes
i see zero difference before
experienced zero effect of change on my face after using the product
i returned the product since i had not experienced any good effects out of this
have seen a difference in smoothness when i wake up
it does seem to have a "firming" effect
made my skin darker that it used to be.
it did improve my skin's texture
gives a very slight plumping effect
did make my pores to be a little less apparent
i didn't notice any plumping or firming effects from this product
my pores less noticeable
i don't like leaving negative ones
i did notice an improvement of the longevity of my makeup
it just accentuated every little flaw
any slight texture was highlighted
pores in the t-zone were visible
my pores were not "smoothed" in fact
my foundation went on uneven
it leaves your face a slight shine
overall i have not notice any elasticity/firmness improvement
though this product certainly has a firming effect
may even have a slight plumping effect
see if those effects become visible
as many have noted
has never irritated my skin
i saw no plumping affect
i feel a tightening sensation
there was no difference
this made no difference in the amount of oil my skin produced
mixed with foundation made no difference
i noticed no difference.
there was no noticeable difference
didn't notice any difference whatsoever especially in brightness
saw no difference in the tightening of skin.
it made them significantly noticeable in 3 weeks
prevent the few existing lines from getting worse
noticed no improvement in the dark circles or wrinkles
i noticed that my fine lines became more prominent
his lines look less noticeable
had better results for overall complexion
by week two, i have 5 big pimples.
no doubts about that.
i didn't notice significant difference
lackluster after using this
continued to look worse with continued use
patches were visible through my foundation
also haven't noticed any outst
caused me to have a bad breakout
made my foundation patchy
i mean no visible difference at all
applying this followed by foundation resulted in streaky skin
my skin had a breakout reaction to some ingredient
it made no difference either
haven't noticed much added "glow"
after using this consistently it produced no visible results
i don't notice an overall huge improvement
i think if you have slight puffiness
haven't noticed any changes in my skin
did not notice any difference in the brightness of my skin
get patchy in some areas of my face
it might have blurred
i didn't notice any blurring effect.
i didn't see any blurring effect
i don't notice any type of blurring effect.
noticed getting significantly oiler than i do with my regular products
at first the product seemed to really blur imperfections
would have liked blurred
most startling for me was that it also gave me quite large pimples
i didn't notice any blurring
however i don't see any blurring of pores
there is no improvement to my pore size or skin tone
my "imperfections" have yet to be blurred.
which had been a slight problem
also the following day i had widened pores that were clogged
while it does give you soft skin the result is not as noticeable as the mask
couldn't see an improvement in my skin
when i stopped the pimples were still there
overall not a bad product.
no real difference noticed in my skin.
i did not notice any significant changes in the appearance of my skin
i noticed no change in pore size nor did i notice my makeup lasting longer
before i put on my makeup i definitely saw that my pores were blurred or at least less noticeable
have noticed an increase in oiliness
my skin is noticeably more congested
as the type of acne it caused was worse than any pimple i've dealt with
this product caused a major skin freak out for me
clarisonic my skin was noticeably dull
i've never seen any impurities actually removed
i saw no benefits
no noticeable improvements in my skin.
my eyes always water due to the strong smell.
never noticed any change after use
i noticed the puffiness under my eyes have decreased
but after using this, they have improved greatly!
this is the first eye cream i have used that have showed visible results
haven't noticed a difference with my dark circles though
i didn't see any major changes to my skin
it made some of my acne worse
then i noticed pimples where there have never been any
it has not improved my skin texture
i washed it off almost immediately for fear of a more serious reaction
my uneven texture started to disapate
it is however quite the opposite
though haven't noticed anything different
noticed the labeling on this product looked different
which caused even more acne
my skin cleared up considerably
my skin had been clear for quite some time
they did not decrease in severity or frequency
love the initial feeling though
i noticed more breakouts ☹
i also get a lot of redness
i noticed more pimples all over my face.
after a week of using it i noticed that my breakouts became worse
my main reason of purchasing this product was to clear up my hormonal acne
while i do believe i've seen an improvement in my skin's texture
possibly reduced acne scars
i noticed smoother skin
i did not notice any increase in brightness/vibrancy after 4 uses
it can also feel slightly striping on my skin.
i really haven't seen any significant difference in my skin when i use it
some times i feel like i wake up with a few subtle blemishes the morning after i use this
haven't noticed any brightening effect on my skin
i didn't see any noticeable brightening effects
i didn't notice a brightening effect greater than my purifying face wash
after a few weeks of trying it there are no visible improvements at all
it doesn't really make a noticeable difference
the redness subsided after an hour
perhaps would notice a difference after consistent use
did notice my skin was a lot softer
it minimized the redness of some acne on my face
no change in my skin
i saw no difference in skin clarity or brightness
this became a deal breaker when there were no noticeable effects to using it
i don't see a significant difference on my acne scars after using this product for about a month
did not see any significant improvement on my skin
i expected a slight glow
as for any illumination it wasn't detected at all
all this did was accentuate them due to its shimmer
looking brighter over all
i wouldn't count on this to diminish hyperpigmentation
after repeated use i have still seen no results.
it did not noticeably change the appearance of my face
may have brightened it a bit
like the instant brightening effect
it has not made a difference in my skin
my foundations look horrible now because of the recent decline in my skin texture
didn't notice any positive results
i began seeing lines underneath my eyes that i haven't seen before
the heaviness of this cream made it worse
my acne has minimized a bit
haven't had any amazing results
have seenno improvements with my skin
this made my skin worse!!
my skin was tingling so much
unfortunately this mask had a completely negative impact on my skin
i can feel my skin was brightened after using it
the slight warming effect was very brief
i saw no difference in the texture of my skin either
i notice no difference at all
however every time after i used it i noticed little bumps under my skin
find that after using this for a month at twice a week my skin has improved slightly the existing blemish have healed
i also liked the warming sensation on my skin.
in the morning the blemish looks exactly the same
however after seeing the price
the effect wasn't long lasting
i didn't notice that my skin felt any different in terms of smoothness or moisture retention
two stars because it has no negative effects
i see no difference in my skin
no difference in discolorations at all
would be good for taking off minimal makeup.
my skin felt good afterwards however reading the ingredients i realized it was several different types of silicone silica
my experience was not favorable with this product
felt heavy on the skin
after the residue it left felt similar to the texture of vasilne
however the skin firming/tightening i did not feel at all
i did not notice any visible changes
my normal skin felt the same before
although it may have helped some of the redness
i did not even see a slight change in my skin
i do not see any real visible differences
have seen no improvements in my skin
cannot think of one product i've used from the renewal line that has a noticeable scent
i saw little to no results
my pores were slightly clearer after use
i felt a tightening sensation
i applied yet another layer to alleviate some more of the tightness that remained
noticed nothing changed with my skin
however i saw no anti aging benefits
has almost no odor at all
the only notable pro was it did not irritate my sensitive skin
there was no distinct scent
a big no no to this.
no changes to the appearance of my skin
i noticed no difference in my skin.
this did nothing to improve the redness
it did even out minor blemishes on my cheeks
which made my face way too pale
by lunchtime my red spots are completely visible.
although this product does a good job of correcting blemishes
only had a minimal effect on redness
i saw another review about how it also happened to another pale person
for more medium toned faces with redness-- i'd say definitely take a chance on this cream
it was too noticeable on my skin
more serious blemishes than i have
made my foundation patchy
noticed that my face was itch during the day
have not noticed any change.
it did have a blurring effect on pores
the first thing i noticed was the white color that made my skin look really pale
it actually seemed to exaggerate some lines
never noticed a difference under my eyes
have seen no improvement
no improvement in my lines or under eye bags
no visible results for me
no improvement at all.
my major concern is under eye bags
saw no improvement in anything!!
adjusted my skin pigment for the worse
the dark circles are still there
at first it was okay with a slight tingling sensation that made it feel like it was depicting my eyes
there was no difference at all.
no visible results other than helping to cover dark circles
the fine lines increased
my makeup was patchy
did i notice it "instantly brightened" or "reduced the appearance of dark circles"
this creme was not for me it had an overall drying effect for me
darker circles than before use
dark circles are normal at my age
made my fine lines more visible
hasn't changed dark circles
definitely seeing a brightening under my eyes
i don't see drastic changes
my darkness and dryness hasn't improved.
my lines appeared less visible when i wore this
have not seen any visible difference in repair
however as for effectiveness i cannot say it helped with redness
i got this because of mild redness in my face.
this cream only aggravated my skin more
it did help with redness as promised.
after continued use i noticed my skin getting irritated
this had zero effect on my redness.
i saw no benefit
has actually worsened the dryness
does not significantly improve the condition of my blemish prone
which is a big disappointment
this helps with the redness a little
it will even out any redness
it only barely covers my uneven areas
the sides of my face due to improper treatment of my acne from when i was younger
given the fact that i still have acne marks
this may partly be due to the fact that i already have an oily complexion
i felt as though the product did not remove any of the redness from my acne marks
it definitely helped tone down the redness in my face
hide my redness with as little product as possible
still didn't see any noticeable color correctness
you could see how there was a slight green tint to it
this does correct redness as promised
it works for redness without a doubt
because you barely have to use any to get excellent coverage over redness
normally a slight redness to my checks
a recent outbreak of flaky patches of rosacea on my checks makes this a no
it did reduce the redness a little bit
i tried this treatment hoping it would correct some of the redness caused by rosacea
blending into my skin without being noticeable
tones down my acne scars substantially
many users of this noticed significant hydration.
my skin definitely has improved a bit with this cream: i haven't had the dreaded winter "flakes"
overall my skin looks smoother
my main concern was lifting
no lifting is greatly seen
i certainly haven't noticed any "contouring" effect
the next day i had the most severe acne breakout i've ever had in my life
woke up with no visible pores
unless it has permanent/lasting effects
it has the consistency
my pores are more visible i used it for a week straight
more visible than ever
noticed a difference in the texture of my skin
it also did not really help blur my pores/slight imperfections
but i see no sign of brightening or firming.
i did noticed an alcohol smell in the cream
i love this product because it really calmed down my overall redness
my skin felt heavy
i looked so pale afterwards due to the white cast this left on my face
it wasn't insane but it was noticeable.
definitely noticed a white cast
it felt slightly irritating to my skin
smoother or improved in any way
i still have scars from my breakout
spread it all over til a slight white cast was left
nothing only uneven skin
however i have not noticed a decrease in oil production in fact mine has worsen
i still am having acne spots appear
my acne continued to worsen
i did see some results in smoothness
i am battling two massive blemishes
it has been really effective in fading any dark marks i may have
appears to have "more" creasing in my under eye area
no changes with fine line or wrinkles
it definitely brightened my skin.
and it is very noticeable and glittery!
i think a lot of people who have left more positive reviews haven't seen this in the full scope of lightings
it is not subtle in any way.
did highlight my skin
there were no differences
this product definitely is noticeable
the accentuated skin texture was terrible
the results after 2 weeks were visible.
due to the application trouble
as to the actual product i saw no change
i don't notice a different with reduced wrinkle
didn't see many results in terms of reducing puffiness
i didn't notice much of a difference with reducing puffiness or dark circles
it smoothed things out slightly
this one claims "instant properties" however nothing was instantly changed on me
i felt did very little in reducing the puffiness under my eyes
i actually experienced a bit of burning
i noticed my eyes were creasing more than ever while using it
i saw little to no difference in the skin underneath the eye area
i do not have severe dark circles
i did not see any difference in puffiness or dark circles
haven't noticed any firming
i did not notice any difference to my the skin on my neck with with daily
it has dulled my skin
there has been no firming at all
have not noticed an improvement
have not seen a difference
my wrinkles still appear the same
not even a slight improvement.
i would need to see dramatic results
unfortunately after two weeks of use i saw not even minor improvements in the very faint lines on my forehead
the remaining lines are only softened.
i loved the immediate change to my skin texture
saw no results that weren't temporary
i will use a little less of the product to see if that impacts the redness
the smell is minimal
it was absorbed by my skin in no time
obvious by the title
however it made my makeup
my face was worse in terms of oiliness than usual
it left a pretty significant film on my skin
i noticed small breakouts
for the steep price tag i expected spectacular results
didn't notice any difference in redness
considering the minimal results i saw
i didn't see any improvement in my redness
there is a long lasting odor in this cream that remained on my skin even after washing
no difference in skin texture
i also got major redness
foundation made it more apparent
when i used it the first thing i noticed was my skin above my eyebrow was peeling
using it only caused my face to look dull
it is obvious that it has some kind of dark color
if i had darker skin i would use this as a sheer
the tint in this product left a noticeable makeup line
among many other cringe-worthy irritants in this eye cream
there is no visible sign of a reaction or irritation
this product definitely exacerbated it
after using it several times i saw no visible results
as in no reduction of fine lines or diminishing of pores
it doesn't really detract from my opinion of the product overall
glowiness or improved skin texture
marula oil i have seen a great improvement in my cheeks
was able to leave this on for 20 with no discomfort or redness
the reason that i am not enamored with it is that there was not really a noticable effect for me
i also experienced a slight breakout around my chin
other than that it's unimpressive
after a week of use i haven't noticed any difference in my skin
however it didn't impact my skin positively or negatively
i didn't notice any change to my skin in terms of brightness
it also made my skin breakout with a few pimples.
i also didn't see any change in my acne scars.
get good results without the irritation
this one was has had no noticeable effect whatsoever
i also didn't notice much of a difference in my acne scars
i don't see any major difference to my skin
this is a serious miss
which left my makeup patchy
i've started to notice that the cleanser is deteriorating the black cap
still am suffering with flakiness
still no change in the dark circles
a lot of little small red dot
major breakout in my chin area after 2 days of use
and it makes my pores seem more pronounced.
after using it two years i noticed no real difference on my skin
on top of that it worsened breakouts.
the effect was stunning the next morning that my skin is much smoother
there were no noticeable changes
no noticeable difference after using for about six months no difference in dark circles or in wrinkles
i saw a very slight improvement in my little smile lines
have seen no improvements
accentuated every bump i had
has uneven skin tone
there's no noticeable difference in the way my makeup sets
i barely noticed a difference in the appearance of my skin
this product blurred out my imperfections in few seconds
i personally found that the blurring is more noticeable in photos than irl
make my foundation patchy
while i like the blurring effect
i also noticed that it did make my pores look smaller
made my makeup patchy
i saw very little if any improvement of my chronic dark circles
didn't cause any negative outcomes
see a little improvement with dark circles
the lines around my eyes seem to have smoothed out/are less noticeable
the actual product is in a little chamber that is about 1/4 of the bottle shown in the picture
haven't noticed a marked difference in puffiness
i switched to a different eye cream to see if that made a difference
it made my dark circles look worse
immediately saw a slight darkening
i noticed a slight improvement in my dark circles
help with wrinkles/texture improvement
or diminish any fine lines
i did not notice any dramatic or significant changes under my eyes though
i still have the same dark circles
wrinkles or is supposed to make the area around my eyes appear brighter
due to the higher price i was expecting to notice an improvement
however i haven't seen a difference in the hydration in the skin around my eyes
or a reduction in the puffiness there
i've noticed more breakouts than before when i was using pores no more
nor really decreasing my breakouts at a faster rate
it felt kind of gross on my skin
report if it improved
sheer transformation for the past 4 years without any problems
did cause a lot of redness in my skin
didn't notice dramatic results
i developed a slight dry path under my eye
i did notice that one of my fine lines looked less visible with this cream on
there is no improvement
i've seen little improvement regarding any lines or circles
i found building it up made it look a little uneven
the results were terrible
i did notice the wrinkles under my eyes disappearing
the worse breakout i've had in months
fortunately i haven't had any skin reactions
haven't seen any improvements
can tell a slight reduction in fine lines
no improvement in dark circles or sagging.
still didnt see any improvement to my skin
blemish prone skin that can look a little dull
i saw no difference in my skin nor makeup application
i gives me serious breakoutsi had some problems with my skin after using a face cream
:( nothing changed in my routine.
even noticed some irritation with it
i think it made my makeup look worse as it decreased its wear time
my skin condition has been getting worse
when they changed the spf to 40
was hoping to find a higher spf option for my pale skin
zero complaints, my skin was flawless.
which seemingly shows only to change the spf
the lady at sephora made it seem like it wouldn't be a very noticeable difference after one use
slightly different than the previous product
it hasn't changed yet
saw literally no difference
i really saw no reduction in blackheads
so far the results have been positive with it reducing the redness
i noticed no differences when i used this mask.
have not noticed any difference at all
it made my skin breakout
i barely noticed any difference after using this mask
nothing about my face changed afterwards however.
applying-small little tears appear
my skin was tighter
the redness was something i expected to happen
even around my eye brows was no expected
didn't see any difference in my skin compared to previous moisturizer i was using that was less than half the price
my complexion is even
i could be coincidental
my initial impression was not a good one
i saw zero change there
i see no reduced puffiness or darkness
the deal breaker for me is that it seems to greatly accentuate the fine lines around my eyes
because i saw no noticeable difference using this serum
i still saw no difference from either product
while my skin hasn't broken out o also have not noticed any vast improvements to my dark spots
nothing has changed in my skin at all
besides some new bumps appearing
sadly had to return it because it caused my acne
i've noticed that my dry patches have become much more frequent
my first unfavorable review has disappeared.
my fine lines are accentuated because of it.
have noticed no difference
didn't see noteworthy changes
i noticed that my circles were lighter
have not experienced this problem in the past
i don't see where it has made any improvements -- no brightening effect which i was hoping for
i also am still experiencing puffiness
my skin has been really stable lately
i've had no eye problems
this has no smell
increased sensitivity to all the products i put on afterwards like my skin had been peeled off
i removed most of my eye
i saw a significant decrease in the amount of products after just a week
my redness stayed the same
it left a slight residue .
was causing the congestion
was just overall uncomfortable
had none of the desired effects after removing
i did notice a difference in my skin texture
unnoticed no changes in my skin
gave me a slight headache
the tingling sensation after 5 minutes was unbearable
there was a small tingle
i noticed that the ball has gotten significantly smaller
once it dried i had a visible shiny outline on my face of where it had been applied
noticeable at my hair line
there was no difference in my skin except that it was dryer than normal
saw a negative effect on my skin
i found no difference in my skin
i also don't really notice improvements in the overall brightness of my skin
i literally saw/felt no effects
noticed how it's shrunk the pores in the areas under my eyes where they are largest
it is slight at best
there is still no noticeable difference at all in my skin
haven't noticed much of a difference in my skin
i expected to see a difference in my skin
no difference at all.
haven't seen any results at all
it actually lost firmness
wrinkles have not diminished at all
the few wrinkles i have were magnified
my expression lines became more visible
my uneven skin tone became even more apparent
my skin had no change
see no difference whatsoever
i did notice a huge difference in the condition of my skin
have shown no signs of change unlike the other people reviewing this product
i also noticed that this has clogged my pores
however i saw zero difference.
my lips were only slightly softer in the morning
seems to cause my skin to breakout
the second day i only did one half of my face to see if it would be a noticeable difference
the product was noticeably beading up
the only downside is that my skin felt sticky even long after the initial application
especially given its having made the allure cut
so this failed noticeably because it made my skin feel both dehydrated
i didn't notice to much of a brightening effect
my skin was not noticeably softer.
nor did i notice any added glow.
i noticed no difference in texture or skin tone.
my redness did diminish
i saw no visible change to my skin except redness
my skin has been amazing lately
i experienced more intense brightening from the glamglow brightening mask
subtle effects so far
i didn't notice much of a difference in the evenness of my skin tone
there is however a slight white-cast in flash photography
i still see some redness peaking
that color matched ok
overall the product smoothed my skin
there was no other noticeable difference
i did notice some immediate effects
i didn't notice any improvement in fine lines or brightness
i didn't notice any sort of drastic changes
have huge results in 7 days
not an improved amount of radiance overall
it has a slight fragrance if you're sensitive to that
i did notice lightening in my hyper pigmentation
i saw no decrease in wrinkles
no significant change in firmness
it caused a few breakouts as well.
out of all the product claims it mentioned other women noticing
though the positive thing about it was my acne scars fading a bit
was unable to use it longer than that due to skin irritation
overall i believe that this product helped reduce my forehead/expression lines initially
i think it may have diminished a bit of fine lines
i did experience increased hydration around my eye area
just once or twice i noticed some luminosity
of course the dark circles still there
i found zero results from this product on dark under eye circles
no change in dark circles
i also noticed it does soften fine lines.
found that just after a few uses the bottle was substantially lower in product
haven't seen any results with 3 weeks in wearing this
definitely makes my under eyes significantly more puffy in the morning
i noticed grey on the pad
i could feel my skin tightening after usage
i've noticed my skin is a bit brighter since using
have not noticed any visible difference :
i definitely notice a general difference in reduced dullness
i hoped it would reduce my acne scars
i immediately saw results in the texture
although the formula helped reduce some of my redness
it makes all my pores visible
it does help reduce some of my redness
i realized that i was developing prominent whiteheads
my skin started to improve
the redness on my face got worse
helped with my redness from rosacea a little bit
reducing the redness there by a bit
the brightening effect was gone as well
have not noticed any change in my skin
i've barely made a dent in the bottle.
it has the consistency
i just haven't seen any noticeable changes in my skin itself since starting to use this
it did seem to help the redness fade faster
the brightening effects are only temporary
has some good aha however
haven't noticed any results on my combination skin
do notice a positive difference
i see a difference in skin tone
i noticed no benefits
acne scars as i was led to believe
i noticed some small bumps along my jawline
despite the overwhelming smell
the only positive is it didn't make me break out or have any adverse effects
i didn't notice any positive effects either.
my makeup looked patchy
i notice a slight difference
immediately had an entire face of huge pimples
after one use my skin was noticeably glowing
i started to notice breakouts
my face broke out rosacea intensified.
saw no changes in my skin
i wouldn't say this has dramatically changed my face
it has helped it reduce dark marks a bit
the only difference i noticed was that i was more oily
this product caused neither
it hasn't improved with my current breakouts
would also help with redness
it seems to have made the redness worse
my face is normally clear
did not feel any tightness
i noticed an increasing amount of flaking throughout my face
exaggerated my frown lines
this cream was such a disappointment.
my face became smoother
it is still lingering
the regular smell was magnified times 100
i never noticed a strong fragrance in the past
the odor or the consistency any more
which was what probably caused the acne
within minutes i had a headache from the strong smell
while my acne hasn't gotten worse
although i have had no blemishes arise
any pimples or breakouts i have disappear or are significantly reduced
this product caused me to breakout
was hoping to reduce a couple of faint age spots.
slightly indifferent to the product
have noticed better results from other skin treatments within the same amount of time
it's a light cream with no noticeable smell
i also noticed hormonal acne would come to a head right away
worse in the morning
not noticing any kind of change in my skin with this product
i gave it 3 stars because it may just need more time with some minor modifications with routine
it has not made immediate differences
black eyes were still obvious
there are two things that i have noticed
first the wrinkle between my eyebrows has improved
my acne scars have not faded
it has not prevented fine lines or acne
it did diminish some puffiness
there has been no real improvement in my dark circles
this product however did not help decrease my dark circles or de-puff my eyes
my biggest eye area of concern is darkness underneath the eyes
lately i am noticing fine lines in that area that are more visible than before
i see no visible difference in using this product
i see no brightness on my face or any reduction in the puffiness i experience
didn't see any difference in puffiness
really wanted to see the puffiness immediately decrease
i saw no difference with this product.
it made my wrinkles appear temperaily deeper after using it
i've noticed a drastic reduction of the dark circles normally under my eyes
noticed the lack of dark circles after one day going to apply concealer
had the puffiness been reduced
puffiness were more pronounced than they normally are
only helped with puffiness slightly
haven't seen any difference as of yet
has not diminished puffiness
i've noticed no difference between this
haven't really noticed any effect on puffiness or dark circles
it seemed like i noticed a difference in puffiness the first application
i do feel a slight sting in the outer corners of my eyes when applying
i think it might reduce the puffiness
didn't feel it did anything noticeable for puffiness
the ache i have in my eye has lessoned
have not seen noticeable difference
it hasn't done anything to decrease my dark circles
have made a noticeable different
it did not visibly change my problem areas at all
it caused little red marks on my face
red bumps which i have not had in years
i started to get a few bumps on my lower cheeks
caused a breakout even though i am 40
unnoticeable bumps on my skin that i chose to ignore
for some reason my reaction to it has worsened
my face still felt gross
while my face did feel the slightest bit softer
i am seeing more breakouts
my acne has gotten progressively worse
i've gotten the occasional acne before
have had more pimples
blemishes than i have ever had
this made blemishes worse if anything
this made no difference on my breakouts.
since my skin isn't any clearer
there is no noticeable difference
since it goes on clear
it did nothing to reduce my breakouts nor redness
none of them showed any improvement
doesn't diminish the appearance of acne spots
the fact that it is a clear gel
i didnt notice any signficant changes on the areas where i applied this product
none left with no result
i saw no difference
say no improvement whatsoever
experienced horrible burning sensation
for the past 5 days i can not apply anything to my eye area without experiencing a burning sensation
was recommended this eye cream due to the quality
main concerns are preventing undereye wrinkles from worsening
this eye cream claims to diminish dark circles.
i don't see any positive difference
haven't seen much improvement
unfortunately the effect was only temporary
instead of seeing any improvement
i noticed more fine lines under my eyes
there has been no change with hyper pigmentation
didn't notice any brightening or lightening effects
haven't seen any improvement on my dark skin
there was no benefit to my skin
which had literally zero affect on my skin in that regard whatsoever
did not see any brightening i have a lot of discoloration
saw no different in appearance
though not as much as the sleeping facial
however this was overwhelming
immediately noticed the strong
i did not notice any changes in skin brightness
i did notice major breakouts around my chin
don't notice any wow effect with brightening
i did notice brightening
i didn't notice any difference in the brightness of my skin
grabbed this due to the minimal chemicals
its not wowing in the brightening department either
didn't notice any of the brightening results
the number of bumps on my chin has increased
resulted in really big pimples
i've noticed a little bit of acne clearing up
though there have been a h
it made my already red skin
i did not see any improvement with redness.
it immediately made my face worse
causing a worse breakout than i've had in years
i didn't notice any difference in the redness factor of my face as i have mild rosacea
did nothing for my redness.
have not noticed any difference.
makes the redness worse
it made my skin more red
redness has not reduced
i've seen more dramatic results from other creams
i did not see any major improvement.
saw no visible results
i do feel a tightening sensation when it is first applied
saw no improvement overall
i felt it was causing more redness then anything
sephora came me store credit- i have visible pores
my pores look smaller since i have begun using this product
it has not diminished the appearance of my pores much if at all
there was no noticeable difference in the size of my pores
i see only a slight change in the appearance of pores
unless you have a severe pore
i did not notice any difference in the amount of debris in my pores
i've noticed virtually no difference in pore size
it probably made my pores on my nose 4% smaller
it says some have noticed pore size reduction within minutes
so far i have noticed no change in my pores
unfortunately the pink/rednedness of my face has not lightened
it also a slight scent, which is also new.
did alleviate some redness temporarily.
my redness still looks the same from day one
i noticed less bumps
this product did nothing to decrease the redness or dryness on my face
still help with the sudden small breakouts i get
during this time i had minor skin irritation because of allergies
and i feel it made the redness worse.
it hasn't diminished the redness in the slightest
it actually caused breakouts
my skin has been flaky lately
this product did nothing to combat the redness
i still have redness
have not seen a significant reduction of reddness
my redness was not reduced
i did notice a bit of reduction in redness
actually made my oiliness worse after 3 days of continues use
furthermore my skin appeared more irritated.
i still have some redness
the redness is better than before
does appear to tighten the skin a bit
it has no efeect whatsoever with my slightly redness on my cheeks
i might notice a bit of lightening.
they have not firmed or diminished dark circles
it does not significantly reduce the look of them
there has been no improvement in the dark circles at all
has made some what of an improvement in the discoloration
haven't seen any change at all
saw no visible results
i am yet to see any dark circles disappear
it hasn't done much to improve the condition or visibility of my dark circles
i primarily wanted something to diminish undereye circles
sadly that's the only difference i've seen
my major issues are discoloration
i noticed some reductio in pore size
just a slight minty smell which only lasts a short time
i didn't see any noticeable results
it reminds me of a softening mask or something.
on the positive side though
also gave me bumps and acne.
it also is causing my makeup to shift.
the only thing i can give positive feedback on is the matte lip plumper by them
nor did it diminish the dark spot i have
my main concern is with my pore size
my skin was brighter
the small bumps reappeared
my skin tone hasn't got any visible change.
i decided to start with one product first to see if there would be a visible difference
we both not seen any changes
i also did not notice any dark spot correcting
it enhanced my acne scars even more
noticeably help with my dark circles
since i don't have many problems with my eye area other than dark circle
other than feeling refreshing due to its gel texture it has minimal benefit for skin around the eyes
i started noticing that i developed an allergic reaction to this product
i also started noticing that it started itching too
i don't even see minimal change using this product
i sadly did not see any improvement in my puffiness
there may be a slight decrease
which just adds to my dissatisfaction
i would definitely look elsewhere for a puffy eye remedy
it makes no difference in the puffines of my eyes or the appearance of deep circles
it does reduce some of the puffiness of the eyes
i do notice a mild decrease to puffiness.
this is the only product i've found that hasn't cause any breakouts for me around my eye area
have not seen a noticeable difference in the skin around my eyes
have noticed nothing different
i don't notice an improvement in lines or dark circles
has no wrinkles under his eyes at all
no real immediate or lasting results
unfortunately saw no change in the dark circles or wrinkles under my eyes
did nothing to improve skin texture or reduce the appearance of fine lines
i do feel a slight firming effect
my puffiness is still there
the lines are not so noticeable
this product has had a remarkable effect on the lines i have at the corners of my eyes
there have been no changes in the lines under my eyes or the sagging above my eyes
my skin had been looking less than stellar
the smell that others have reported as bad i found okay
like not having it on apart from an infrequent
i never noticed any difference positive or negative
i didn't see any reduction in poor size
there isn't a noticable difference in my pore size either
i saw no improvement with my blackheads or large pores
i did notice after the first use that it had reduced the amount of blackheads on
found that small black heads are not removed or diminished
in 5 weeks it literally made my pores visibly larger
i actually found that my skin texture in areas became rough with tiny bumps when i used this product
i experienced similar results
it felt like a heavy mask
although it is still breaking out with new blemishes caused by this cream
i saw no visible difference of any kind
my pores are still huge
visible- i really wanted this to work
however, the effect is big, empty pores.
it made no change in my skin :
it has made a difference in my skin tone
i noticed smaller pores on my cheeks only.
for some odd reason
i only applied it to the tip of my nose where i have noticably enlarged pores
while this product seemed to help even out redness
not only did it make the area of the sunburn way worse any surrounding areas were bright red
if the outside has changed this dramatically
i also experienced tingling
found this to be just average compared to my previous moisturizers
absorbent however i really haven't seen any difference in my skin after using it for about 3 weeks
my skin still looks uneven.
did not note marked improvement in skin softness
there hasn't been a noticeable difference in the red scars
my fine lines have not increased
dark spots are slightly lighter
my problem was some of the ingredients that i had noticed in this product
although needed a little bloating mid-day
there were slight tingling / watery eye sensation if it gets into your eyes
although being blemish prone
i liked the sheer luster and it was discontinued.
i found that this caused my eyes to sting
saw no major changes on my skin
i didnt noticed any improvement on my skin tones
definitely noticed the smell
the only visible results are better hydration of the skin
found it no longer wards off the wrinkles
have not noticed any change
it has no discernable smell to me
yet no improvement to my dark circles
after 4 weeks of use i have not noticed any big changes
it has not changed my eye area one bit.
i didn't notice a reduction in my under eye circles
i did see a very faint softening of some fine lines
however, there were some major setbacks.
have noticed an increase in the number of eyelashes i've been shedding
cons: i think it have me small eye irritation in the beginningi don't see any improvement on the skin around my eye
get many compliments on the clarity of skin
didn't see any improvement in dark circles or under eye wrinkles
i did not see any noticable differences in puffiness
i saw no improvement in my fine lines or wrinkles
i did not see any difference in dark circles or puffiness
have noticed some improvement
there has been no difference
i also just started showing signs of wrinkles around my eyes
i started noticing that my dark circles have gotten worse
i do however have major puffiness
i see no change under my eyes
just thought people should be aware of this discrepancy
results are minimal though
did nothing for the puffiness
did not diminish wrinkles
while i did notice some brightening around the eye area
have noticed a slight improvement in the overall darkness of the circles under my eyes
have seen no decrease in dark circles under eyes
no reduction of wrinkles or dark circles
this eye cream made my eyes worse.
my complexion is normal
i dont have any major skin concerns
a few people have said there's a tingling sensation
i experienced a strong burning sensation around my nose
after a bad chemical burn a few years ago anything that burns or stings severely i remove immediately
no immediate change on my skin.
i did not notice a brighter skin tone afterward
don't know if i've seen or felt anything significant
although ptr products have lessened my acne considerably
didn't notice any visible differences
my concerns are dark circles
still haven't seen any improvement with the annoying crows feet wrinkles
my fine lines are visibly reduced
however i haven't really noticed any difference in the fine lines around my eyes
have not noticed the slightest bit of difference in wrinkle reduction
i saw no improvements at all on dark circles
made my lines more prominent
no noticeable results after 2 months.
it also didn't decrease puffiness.
i noticed that my skin was flaking really bad
if the smell/odor of this cream were better i would have kept it
this caused lots of little red blocked pores
had to return it due to the fragrance which is quite prominent
plus i haven't noticed a much difference in fine lines
/i still have dark circles
i am 43 years old with the usual wrinkling around the eye area accompanying my age
i never noticed any difference in the skin around my eyes or lips
used it for over a month with no difference in eye puffiness or fine lines
haven't had any adverse reactions to it
i do find that there is no lessening of fine wrinkles around my eyes
i didn't see any immediate effects or changes as claimed
i've noticed a slight improvement in the lines under my eyes
although nothing super dramatic.
haven't noticed any differences in my eye area as compared to other eye creams i've tried
only the very beginnings of wrinkles
the disappointment though is that this never removed all of my makeup
my fine lines weren't improved
no other type of improvements were noticed
if irritated/red it looks startling
i notice that the blueness as lessened
there is no change
did not notice any firming
soften those little lines in the corner
have not noticed any firming around my eye area
visible results with it
so much for brightening and firming!!
although i didn't see much decrease in the appearance of fine lines
haven't seen any results for brightening my under eyes
the alcohol in the product made his skin more red than it already was
i could see small irritation bumps
they became more visible once i applied my make up
have no under eye problems
i noticed milia start to come in
they were still visible by the time i got to work
i could see that my puffy eyes little by little disappear
saw no difference in appearance of fine lines
did not reduce puffiness
however i cannot say i have noticed an improvement in my dark circles
i also didn't notice much of a decrease in puffiness
i did not notice any significant changes when i stopped using it either
big reduction in my puffy under eye area
have not seen a difference
i did not see a difference in my dark circles or puffiness
have not seen a difference with fine lines
only minimal dark circles
didn't notice any brightening of dark circles.
"all about eyes" is for the eyes what "dramatically different moisturizer" is for the face
never had this problem with origin eye creams.
his skin is showing some aging
neck experienced extreme flare ups that were hard
it left a slight residue on my skin.
with continous use i have noticed larger pores
i've haven't noticed any difference in my skin
have seen little to no difference
it had no last affects on redness
like big noticeable break outs.
i found this mask unpleasant to look at
which diminished soon after removing the mask
this mask makes no difference to my skin
it made no change to my face
my skin saw no benefit from this
it actually noticeably reduced my forehead wrinkles
i normally have clear skin
i got big red blemishes from this
it has no rough texture in any sense of the word.
the biggest problem for me is that i noticed it made my eyelashes fall out
didn't notice a large difference with my eye area
huge improvement in my eye area
i don't see an obvious improvement under my eyes.
made my crows feet more pronounced
no visible black circle or line away results.
ed these symptoms from my environment
when i drop money it has to be acne fighting or exfoliating or some other noticeable effect
redness--also am prone to both
likely have a little big of a compulsive personality
while it helped with the redness
sadly all i was left with was scarring
my acne got worse
pretty intense scarring occurred
i noticed it was making my breakouts worse
i don't think it makes a dramatic difference in my skin
it tingles a little bit which is probably due to the menthol
it shifted under my makeup
pores appeared slightly smaller than usual
my pores are still very much visible through my foundation
it was disappointment as i have a skin condition excessive dryness
it brings my died skin obvious
after a few days of use my skin felt irritated with little tiny bumps everywhere
my pores are still very visible
no difference in the appearance of my pores
however maybe on lighter complexions it's more noticeable?
not as good as my recent discovery
it definitely has a blurring effect
i still had the occasional blemish
clogged skin any worse
i still have small smile lines
saw no change or improvements in my skin
i noticed pores that have never been obvious to me before
that made a difference almost immediately
liked how it brightened my face
there are little scabs over some areas
i see no visible changes
just recently i noticed that the pleasant smell has turned a bit putrid months before its expiration date
because no eye-brightening treatment has ever worked for me--my dark circles are caused by a combination of allergies
it had no effect whatsoever in a month of faithful use
within an hour or less i ended up having a severe allergic reaction to the product
enlarged pores ever since i've started using this product
my pores have never been that visible before
it did not help my skin look clearer or help with any existing blemishes/breakouts
made my skin more irritated
i also had some slight irritation.
the product has no irritated my skin
my acne hasn't gotten worse
i've used it for months with no noticeable improvement
since that sounds like my main skin problem: those annoying red marks that stay even after the swelling has gone down
yet i wouldn't expect dramatic results
it hasnt improved my skin at all
i can not see any noticable difference in the appearance of blemishes
caused my skin to break out severely.
some people have commented on the smell
i didn´t notice any difference in my eyes
there are 1005 drops in 1
no improvement with dryness
there was no smell.
my skin tone was still the same
have seen no difference in my skin
sadly with no results
it was no comparison
seemed to aggravate my rosacea
saw no changes in my skin.
help the little one that i already have on my forehead which isn't always visible
i did not see any improvements in texture or wrinkles
no difference at all in my skin's appearance
i used half of the container without ever noticing a difference
i did not notice a significant difference with dark circles or wrinkles
my main concerns were fine lines
under eye wrinkles have not changed
the only change i noticed was puffier than usual eyelids in the morning
i noticed after applying this products
teenage i did suffer from some acne
i cannot say that this product helps in minimizing wrinkles under my eyes because i just noticed now that it is more prominent than before
my wrinkles are even more visible now.
slightly improved dark circles
visible smoothing effect after just a few applications
those seemed to have improved some
although i saw no reversal
literally nothing has changed
i used this creme because i have very apparent dark circles mainly due to stress
severely aggravated the corners of my mouth
by the end of the day i noticed a couple of new pimples on my skin
see no marked improvement.
the only positive i had was that it absorbs quickly
i must be one of the few that had no noteable change
my fine lines are less noticeable
this one definitely agitated my skin
because i have not noticed any anti-aging benefits either
i also did not notice any brightening effects as it claims
my light hyperpigmentation marks still look the same
i definitely had some noticeable pimples here
everyone noticed a difference in my skintone after 1 month
other than a blemish from it
while i am aware it is supposed to be lightening it made my whole face look pale
my skin is definitely whiter after use
my whiteheads are a bit more pronounced
my acne has gotten noticeably worse
the bumps was not visible however whenever i touch my face i could feel the many small bumps which disgusted me
little bumps started forming on my skin
haven't noticed a huge difference in my skin's brightness
day after that my face looked lack luster
haven't seen a major change in the freckles or color on my face
with no changes in my under eye area
the only beneficial thing i noticed was the reduction of my dark circles
while using this product i've noticed that a vein on my lower left corner of my eye was more noticeable now
this is something i noticed for almost all clinique products
no hydration, no brightening, no lifting.
it definitely smoothes a bit bit i didnt notice any change on dark circles
haven't seen much of a difference
a pimple that was already on my face was decreased in size quickly
they also caused redness
was hoping that this product would help improve my skin complexion
although it did reduce the redness a little in the first week
i've started getting small bumps/acne in places i've never have
i noticed my foundation was still on my skin
overall even out my skin tone
the residue it left made my skin feel more irritated than "soothed
unfortunately there was a very strong odor that seemed to linger
noticed a difference in my face
i am yet to notice any improvement on my skin
i said my main concern was more the alcohol evaporating so closely to my eyes
do have slight puffiness
i don't see a lot of improvement on my dark circles or in general
have visible darkening under my eyes
which was surprising since i love my other ren products
i used the gel for several weeks without any noticeable effects or improvements
felt/saw no difference
i cannot see any visible results :
no changes at all in eye area.
my fine lines were more obvious
no visible results yet...goes on easily
there wasn't a noticeable change in my appearance
have seen no difference in the size of my pores or the amount of impurities
is that this mask has no visible lasting effects
the difference in my pores was almost unnoticeable
they are all invisible just like what the title says however they are visible again after a few hours
i don't think it has changed pore size
used it once noticed a little difference in my pores
didn't produce any dramatic results for me
i didn't see a huge improvement with my acne
since switching to kate sommerville's line i've noticed vast improvement compared to this product
all of a sudden this product made my breakout so much around my cheek
not only has my acne greatly reduced
i noticed my makeup goes on a lot smoother
even saw new breakouts emerge
my previously existing blemishes were worse
noticed that my acne does clear out faster
saw a nearly immediate improvement in my skin
have not noticed any difference
so far i have not noticed major changes
i did not notice a reduction in pores
in days saw positive change
i still don't see any improvement in discoloration
just saw no lightning of the acne spots
my dark spots have not noticeably diminished
my dark spots are no lighter
t seen a big change
texture has improved since i started using it
haven't seen any noticeable improvements in my skin
this product has not even slightly diminished the fine lines or wrinkles
no big improvements yet
fine line is still visible.
this has had little effect on my eye wrinkles
it was obvious that the culprit was this cream.
i stopped using it pretty quickly because puffy under eyes outweigh a 50/50 chance of treating wrinkles in my opinion
have not noticed an appreciable difference in my medium under eye wrinkles
have had no improvement in wrinkles at all
now i am seeing a slight improvement
i do mean slight
no positive results whatsoever
thought i'd splurge since i'm starting to get noticeable wrinkles around my eyes
made my overall complexion look worse
it think it helped with redness
cheeks where i had never even gotten a single blemish
my skin tone is still uneven
my pores are still huge
i really notice its presence
now my skin has actually started to flake in some areas
the breakouts still occurred
in between my eyebrows
none of the products cleared any imperfections
i started getting some serious pimples all over my face
i saw an increase in oil production
it definitely prevented more acne
it created little cracks in my skin
i experienced no reduction in breakouts
it significantly reduced the size of a blemish overnight
the main reason you would use this product would be to clear up troublesome acne
haven't seen any major improvement in my acne
discomfort in those areas for a week or more
i mean it felt like i had suffered through a severe chemical burn
waited for even the slightest result
even on my tiniest bumps it seemed to only half affect the area
on some problem spots
have seen no results
still had a negative experience with this product
some areas did get bright over night however other areas just got bright red
my skin has improved tremendously since then
the results are minimal, at best.
the product changes color from a clear gel to a orange
didn't see much of an improvement from my acne marks
the dark spots are still there
don't see any changes to my acne scars
i can say this gel did reduce a lot of redness from when i first started using it
i don't really see any progress in my acne scars fading
it does fade the marks
i didnt see any lightening at all
unfortunately i have not had positive results with this product
it may have helped me to reduce the redness.
which caused me to have more scars on my face
still see no change
any blemish i have- especially on my cheeks
an increase in acne did occur
my acne kept increasing
i never saw lightening of any of my acne marks nor of the new ones this gel created
i would recommend this for people who have lighter acne scars
i didnt see that dramatic result until about a month
it made it less red
don't think the results are very dramatic
my scars look extremely similar to acne scars
i feel like i have seen a slight improvement
mostly lightening on the coloration
the lightening was very minimal
in the past 3 months i have really noticed a different in my skin
i didn't see any change in my skin as far as lighter pigmentation after using this product
with minor breakouts the next morning that only become exasperated with continued use
without any visible success on my sunspots
i saw no improvement in fine lines
just a major disappointment considering all the actives
shoulders had no improvement
there has been no change in the frequency of my back breakouts
no improvement in my back acne
if it did work the results are minimal.
my skin is never 100% clear
however i don't see a huge difference in acne at all
was aware that it might be drying
no changes seen in my current acne issues either.
also caused a lot of texture in places i have never had that problem before
i've noticed more breakouts since using this product
no change in redness
my skin hasn't looked this bad in years
tried this clear complexion formula
also, i had worse acne break outs when using it.
although it hasnt improved my acne at all it does a good job at removing makeup
have not noticed any improvements in my skin
stubborn acne that has flared up lately
there were no big problems with it
was pointed to the boscia skin care line
the clear complexion line was horrible
this made my acne worse
saw no change in clearer complexion or reducing my acne
for anything more severe
i did see a slight reduction in my acne
on the weekends with no makeup there was no reduction in oil
have recently been experiencing breakouts on my forehead
since i do suffer from consistent
this did nothing to clear my blemishes.
the redness did not improve either.
it did not reduce my redness whatsoever
does not decrease the acne or redness for me
did not help with redness
i noticed a slight different in the first couple of weeks of use
this hasn't changed my skin at all.
it also made my face tingle in a strange way
i did not see any noticeable change in redness which wouldn't be a big deal if it was at least a decent cleanser
or even eliminate my redness
i did notice redness reduction right after i used this
this has done nothing to help the redness
it hasn't irritated my skin either
it did reduce redness
i got this for some recent redness i was having on my face
... don't see much redness reduction
my face is still suffering from redness
i guess it works for people who just have slight facial redness
it does not reduce redness
i've always struggle with redness correction
when it comes to redness correction that's a negative
this has not done one thing to resolve or lessen my redness
it has not reduced or masked the redness on my cheeks at all
and a tad bit in between and above my eyebrows.
haven't seen any difference at all
i did not notice any significant reduction in redness
within 3 days i noticed that no new breakouts were popping up
i did notice a bit of a reduction in my redness
didn't help with slight redness in skin.
my redness is getting worse
it neither improved or aggravated my skin though
while hoping to reduce my redness
my persistent redness is very similar to a friend's who has been diagnosed
it does not reduce redness at all
i did not see any reductions of redness on my skin
it aggravated my skin
also has not reduced one bit of redness.
in this time my rosacea hasn’t improved
this product did not reduce redness.
did nothing for my redness
haven't noticed any changes in tightening or diminished lines
i've seen no visible results after three months of nightly use
i didn't notice any immediate changes
never noticed a difference while using this mask.
there are a number of great brightening masks out there
haven't noticed a difference in any of the acne scarring i have on my jaw
there was no improvement to my skin.
there was no noticeable difference aside from leaving my skin soft for a few hours
i felt or saw no difference in my skin
i never noticed any real changes to my skin.
it began to visibly change color
my main concern was dark spots
i did not see any noticeable "brightening" of my skin
i don't see changes in my skin
not sure if there had been a noticeable difference
compared to any of the other brightening br
it also caused me to breakout.
i do see a slight improvement in my skin
never seen or felt a difference.
was detracted by price
the pigmentation on my face seemed to even out
the effectiveness diminished or i should say disappear after i have used half bottle of it
also made them darker
i see no difference
haven't seen any results
also did nothiing for after party puffiness....
i noticed improvement in the dark circles around my eyes
i feel like the fine lines in the under eye area have worsened in the last 6 weeks of use
been using nightly as per instructions with no visible difference
after 3 weeks i haven't really seen any improvement
have tried almost 90 eye creams in my life to try to at least significantly reduce my severe under eye dark circles
not even progress towards results.
still see the dark circles.
there's a very slight almost not noticeable difference my dark circles were very pronounced before
my dark circles have not improved
definitely saw a brightening effect at the end of the week
have slight wrinkles under my eyes
my under eye circles look worse
genetically i have pretty noticeable under eye circles
i still did not notice any reduction in dark under-eye circles
did nothing for my minor dark circles
i still have the same undereye dark circles
i find that lately the flakes are actually more noticeable than usual
my fine lines became more noticeable
the dramatically different gel
my skin became worse
i did the ren calming mask first
i will say my forehead line that bothers me is also less noticeable
it effected my allergies
i did see any noticeable results
made my face sting a little.
i don't notice any of positive effects
this immediately caused stinging
less noticeable if i used it over a serum
it does have a noticeable scent
i did not notice any benefits to reducing fine lines or wrinkles
haven't seen any difference in my skin at all
i see no diference or improvement in my skin at all
all of a sudden it has a terrible odor
there was a distinct powder smell to this cleanser that i could not overcome
after 3 days my under eye area was showing signs of deeper lines
this product caused severe eye puffiness
no change in my skin whatsoever.
just fair, so no difference in puffiness
before then noticed things getting more noticeable
the lines under my eyes are more visible than before
my primary problem is dark circles
which were not lessened an iota
probably good for puffiness
my undereye lines are becoming more noticeable
i've noticed no difference in my dark circles either which was one of the main reasons i tried this
i still have dark circles
lately there has been no results for me
no significant changes yet
no noticeable changes in my dark circles
haven't seen any results yet.
my main concern was depuffing
let alone a reaction this severe
it did not decrease the under eye puffiness
i detect a subtle change around my eye area [for the better]
it seems to not work as drastically as the previous 2 products
on top of that haven't seen any improvements in my eye area
there has been no visable improvements
during that time it has diminished some of the fine lines around my eyes
softened a couple of deeper lines
has not helped with puffiness
although i do sometimes feel a slight sting with application
had these little red spots
the lines were more noticeable
i saw no difference in my skin
this facial wash was much too strong
haven't seen any difference
it does have a unusual smell
definitely no positive reaction either
have noticed no change in the firmness of my skin or the lines diminishing
took the $195 plunge in hopes of a notable difference
since i've started using this cream my skin has had huge breakouts
tired due to lack of hydration
while i have not noticed drastic improvement
while i have noticed some firming
was that the young lady who sold it to me assured me that i would notice visible results in my forehead lines
the frown line between my eyes immediately-
never identified an identifiable
i noticed a slight burning sensation
it caused a lot of redness
this dried out my skin like nothing i have ever experienced before
have not seen any improvement in my fine lines
made the imbalance even worse
this cream did make my redness a lot worse
did not notice any effect on redness though
i feel like my redness is worsened by this product
my face would get patchy
i struggle with some redness
started seeing small bumps on face .
did it reduce redness?
it does nothing for the overall improvement of my skin
it improved my skin tone a bit
did not help with the dryness in the slightest
ter in it which is a major no for anyone with acne prone skin
making any acne worse
no difference in my skin!
still had a significantly oily t zone
they also caused redness
i still seem to have a slight reaction when i used it
i expected my face to be glowing
it had a slight stinging sensation to it
i didn't notice any major differences either
no change in the texture of my skin
nor the appearance of any wrinkles
didn't see a visible difference
have yet to see even the slightest bit of difference in my face
i did not find wrinkle reduction or any boost in my skins tightness over time
no real skin difference
i noticed it tingling
even after one use the difference was extremely noticeable
reduced the puffiness significantly
38 now and concerned for aging signs.
refreshing mask that did not provide me with any noticeable results
i still have red bumps
i noticed increased dryness within the very first use of this product
my complexion was uneven before i began using this
now it's still uneven
this was a definite no-go for my skin
it seemed as though it was a similar product
i still felt that uncomfortable tightness
i saw no difference between this product
noticed there isn't even any hyaluronic acid in it
i liked the added protection/immediate moisture
found no change in the hydration levels of my skin
haven't noticed any significant difference
this product made no change
started using it before my skin even showed signs of flakiness
it did not have any noticeable effect for me.
on a positive note it is colorless
i see no difference in my skin
to see if there was any noticeable difference
greasy mess for years before noticing the anti-aging effects
clinique seems to have changed the formula
my main qualm is the smell, though.
i also got 2 huge pimples from it.
haven't noticed any change in wrinkles yet
there is a slight "sting" to it
it does give a slight instant lift to the eyes
it caused breakouts and huge red acne on my face.
this caused a severe breakout
none of their products have ever caused me to breakout
i've noticed my skin improving
this product gives a slight burning sensation to the skin
i saw no improvements
recently have been noticing wrinkles under my eyes
the stinging sensation under my eye started occuring after five days
i slightly started to get noticeable break outs
while the cleanser works fine with no noticeable excess dryness
this product definitely has a positive effect on my frown lines
my skin shows no improvement
i am going to finish using the product to see if there is a noticable change
no significant improvement has been found on my neck yet
thankfully i received a huge discount on this line from lancome
still no results whatsoever
it also claims to make imperfections less visible
let alone diminish fine lines
after the very first use i was startled to notice that the product seemed to amplify the appearance of lines around my eyes
after a week not only had the lines not diminished the cream seemed to somehow amplify the appearance of lines i wanted to hide
have to admit it has helped with the puffiness
it does have a slight smell that irritates my eyes
my fine lines had become huge wrinkles
it has done nothing for my wrinkles
have only seen mild improvement in fine lines.
did nothing to reduce/diminish fine lines
my lines under my eyes looked worse
increased the lines below my eye
even water would have corrected the dehydration i was experiencing in phoenix
cannot tell a noticeable difference in my upper lids
didn't see any improvement in firmness.
made my wrinkles look more pronounced
my wrinkles not only look more pronounced
i fear it has damaged my skin
found no difference in the area around my eyes
no improvements on laugh lines
have noticed subtle differences
this product left a rash
no noticible fine line or wrinkle effect yet
it severely aggravated my skin
no real acne problems
my skin saw no improvement
unimpressive at any cost.
this was one of the few products of the line that isn't a huge disappointment
haven't seen any difference in my skin
haven't seen any results from it
it has the same texture
haven't seen an changes in my acne prone skin
it also made my skin look grey and dull.
my skin felt significantly less greasy
it has a slight wierd smell
i just don't see any upsides to it besides the initial pleasant texture during application
it irritates my eye area--causing it to become red
i've never noticed it make any difference to my skin at all
or at least less redness
i noticed a little improvement, but not a ton.
had a reaction unlike anything i've ever experienced
by the end of the day there are wrinkles that i've never had before because of the dryness
this product made no difference on my skin at all
it helped with my slight redness
on the positive side
it may have also calmed down my breakouts a bit
immediately noticed a different smell
for the past several months i have been struggling with some adult hormonal acne which has been quite distressing
he actually broke out in a couple serious whiteheads
which i thought was unusal for a cleanser
an occasional blemish here or there
haven't seen any discernible results
many reviewers reported immediate results or sustained results after a couple of weeks
this cream feels more substantial
there is no difference what so ever in puffiness
no noticeable results after 2 weeks.
have not noticed any difference
noticed my pores on my nose were getting larger
my face appeared to still have makeup on
which was quite noticeable on my dark skin
as others have mentioned, there is a heavy scent.
probably due to post pregnancy hormonal changes
not even a slight difference.
pores seemed a lot smaller
i noticed breakouts all over face
is worth the money yet as i've been using it for about a month over a retinal resurfacing cream
however it didn't improve my overall skin texture
i gave this product a "fair" rating because i have not noticed any difference in my skin's tone or texture
no other product has had quite the same effect.
am only now seeing some fading
i don't see a huge improvement
there hasn't been any more improvements
i did notice some smoothness
noticed very minimal improvement in my skin's tone
felt like there was an improvement
have not noticed an improvement in my skin
there was no difference in the texture or tone
i am still waiting for the sunspots to disappear
i see no difference in my pores
i still noticed my black heads
there was no improvement at all in my blackheads
none of them solve the problem by diminishing my pores
i seen no difference in the appearance of my skin
making them even more visible
i saw literally no difference
nor did it reduce the appearance of pores over time
didn't cause any adverse reactions
that i saw no visible difference in my skin
seen no results at all
felt that it made no difference to their effectiveness
pores are noticeably tighter
i seen no difference in my skin
i didn't notice a significant change at all
i didn't see any noticable differences
haven't seen much of a difference
my pores looked bigger
no improvement at all
little-to-no change in under-eye bags
slight improvement in areas of discoloration from sun damage
there has been no difference!
so far haven't noticed any change in my eyes
also note that i have really minor fine lines
the fine lines in the outer corner of my eyes haven't been addressed either
am unclear if it has made any difference to my face
i saw no lasting effects
no negative consequences from use other than a diminished bank acocunt
mostly under-eye wrinkles
was hoping for a more dramatic change
can't really see any visible difference.
there was no real improvement
too pricey to keep without a visible result.
unfortunately within a few days of using i developed pretty severe milia
on the negative side
my skin has been dramatically changed."
made my acne worse like it angered it
my face looks clear
not noticed a difference using this
haven't seen a difference in my skin after 6 uses
didn't feel that my skin benefited from this product
it does clear up some of my blemishes
it removed most of the redness on it
almost had the consistency of a mask
haven't had any problems
the blotches looked ever so slightly raised
my age spots were less noticeable
my wrinkles do not appear diminished in any way whatsoever
it also made the texture of my skin worse
i truly believed everyone was being dramatic
big babies complaining about the smell
the smell is still lingering
her face was smoother and brighter.
i could not see a major change
the only thing i noticed was that my skin was smoother
no noticeable difference with my skin
don't see any changes in my skin
the texture of my skin has changed greatly
reducing redness as the sephora consultant had promised
no real noticeable results
uneven skin so the lady at the clinique counter suggested this
after using about 2-3 bottles of this product i saw very minimal results
there may have been some very slight fading of some dark spots on my skin
while it did greatly reduce my already there dark spots
uneven skin tone didn't even out
neither product has evened my skin tone or lightened my age spots
this winter my skin has seemed slight rosy
haven't seen much improvement in sun spots on the face
whether it actually evened my skin tone is questionable
it caused my skin to breakout
however i don't see much of a difference in the appearance of dark circles around my eyes
it really made no difference on my eye wrinkles
there was no improvement
after several weeks of use there was no other visible action
my dark circles are different
i don't see overwhelming improvement
i saw no difference in my eye area
noticed no improvement in dark circles or wrinklesit irritated my eye instead of soothing it
i see no improvement in my dark circles
have noticed a slight difference in the fine lines around my eye area
noticed no significant difference in fine lines or circles after 1 month+ of use
this did not produce any noticeable changes around my eyes
there is a nice tightening effect around the eyes
have seen slight changes
zero effect on the dark circles.
it was a massive disappointment.
it has no smell
very visible difference in my eye wrinkles
this product appeared to do its job on a very minimal level
nothing that was life changing
doesn't make any noticeable changes to the eye area
because this product seems to have helped reduce puffiness under one eye
i guess i was expecting more noticeable results
noticed even more wrinkles
there may be a slight difference
i found that this product has not done anything to address my severe case of extreme under eye puffiness
the burning has increased
haven't noticed a lot of de-puffing yet
i saw no results whatsoever!
no change in dark circles or fine lines.
that has been the only change in my eye care
made no improvement in puffiness
felt a slight burning sensation the first few times i put it on
when i tried it burned like it has some type of plumping affect
is concerned with the ever so slight of lines under his eyes
dry that any positive results it may or may not cause go unnoticed
this product did nothing for me except for slight tingling sensation after application
my mild dark circles haven't changed a bit
made the little lines under my eyes more pronounced
using this product was to help diminish the look of my dark circles
didn't really see any noticable results
it does have a tingling effect upon application that was a little unusual
it even improved the color of the dark circles under my eyes
long term use no improvements on my redness
it helped with my aggravated rosacea
pro: did reduce my redness due to rosacea
it made my redness worse
gave me a severe migraine.
i see zero improvement
still saw no difference
as for redness due to breakouts
never noticed a difference in the redness in my cheeks
it also hasn't made a giant difference in the redness either
it did not improve my redness in the slightest bit
it made the redness around my nose even worse than before
this product really works to temporarily reduce redness however it smells distinctly of eggs
it also caused me to breakout slightly
i didn't see any decrease in redness
no long term or immediate reduction in redness.
my face is immediately irritated
my flare-ups increased
this made me break out and increased my redness.
i did nothing to decrease the redness of my face
i noticed it made my skin even more aggravated as i applied it
i tried this product for a couple months with no decrease in the sensitivity or red/pink color of my cheeks
it does reduce the redness on my face
my face is has slight redness around my nose
it does take away redness to a certain extent
did nothing for my redness
caused me to have terrible breakouts on my normally clear checks
also, i did not see any reduction in redness.
i can literally see the redness in my skin diminishing as i was
has done nothing for my redness
after using this for awhile i noticed that the redness in my skin spread even more on my face
this does reduce mild redness which is what i have
it diminished and healed my acne, overnight.
however, it did not diminish any redness.
it actually made the redness worse.
it didn't have any affect on my facial redness.
no dissipation of redness whatsoever.
my redness showed up in my mid-40s.
also saw no redness relief so i returned it.
hoping that it would at least diminish some of the redness on my cheeks
noticed no changes whatsoever in the tone or color of my skin
i am only giving it three stars because i've never noticed even the slightest difference in my facial redness
did nothing for my redness :
saw a minimal difference in texture
have seen no difference with my skin at all
the only acne scar i have is still the same
i would expect some minor peeling with use of a retinol at 1%
to improve the overall texture of my skin
notice after just a couple of uses that it seemed to make the fine lines around my mouth less pronounced
which was an unintended plus
this product has not caused any breakouts
i noticed more wrinkles with this
if this has made a difference
the first two weeks i saw a visible difference in my skins color
have seen no change in my light sun damage
overall skin texture/appearance
it caused breakouts for me
found that it did nothing to reduce the appearance of pores
however, i found it causes some redness.
it did not appear to have any diminishing effect on my shiny face
it tightened my skin
found that while it slightly decreased oil
it increased oil on my cheeks
it has a slight medicine smell
there is no difference in my fine lines
wrinkles are getting worse
caused zero break outs.
made no noticeable difference when compared to hope in a jar
it has caused no problems with my skin
have not noticed any brightening
as seen in the picture my face is red
didn't see any brightening or other positive signs related to using a new moisturizer
it also caused a few pimples to start forming for me
this product made my skin so irritated over time.
no, no, no, no!
saw no improvement of my breakouts nor prevention
made my acne appear even worse
still had the same breakouts
have noticed no improvement in my skin
i noticed my face looking clear again
my concerns were uneven skin tone
clarity of my skin change
haven't seen any change
as i don’t notice any significant difference
on the positive side
to this moisturizer a couple of years ago i noticed an immediate improvement in my sensitive
unfortunately gave me minimal hydration.
yet it still caused breakouts.
the big problem with this though was the effects it had on my skin
i started noticing more acne than usual on my face
my under-eye circles were not remedied.
i noticed that my skin was brightened when i used it am
they're even visible in baby pictures.
haven't seen any results
this product does not minimize the appearance of puffiness due to the lack of caffeine in the ingredient
not a long lasting depuffing effect
didn't make a noticeable difference
i returned this product after i started noticing wrinkles under my eyes
i don't notice any difference in my under eye puffiness
it hasn't done anything for my under-eye puffiness
i admittedly have some pretty puffy under eye bags partly due to heredity
this product didn't appear to do anything at all to diminish the puffiness
it has not reduced puffiness or dark under eye circles
haven't noticed any huge changes
the puffiness will decrease more
there was no reduction in the puffiness under my eyes either immediately or long-term
i see no difference in my under eye bags/circles.
overall i don't see any real improvement
don't see any real difference in undereye puffiness
i really found that this serum made my dark circles look worse
it only brightened about 50% my under eye color
my face was brighter and smoother.
however i have not seen the firming results i had hoped for
however the smell was unbearable for me
no effect on puffiness
however i haven't noticed any difference in my eye area
i noticed every time i used this eye cream i felt this stinging
the texture was wonderfuk but i saw no results.
suggested that this would work for my dark undereye circles
made my minimal lines more prominent
caused some irritation with my eyes
there may be the teeniest tightening in the creases
i did not notice any other improvements in my complexion
after two weeks all i've noticed are some clogged pores :
i saw no improvements to my skin
no negatives or positives for me.
it made no difference on my skin
the most disappointing part i noticed absolutely no difference in my wrinkles
i did not notice any reduction in lines or clarity in my skin
i am not expecting a drastic difference
i've only seen a slight improvement
my fine lines appear to be a little less noticeable
the smell ruled out any benefit i noticed
only had a slight smell
yet w/ one application my fine lines around my eyes are less noticeable
this product has not made any visible improvements to my eyes
did not improve the dark circles
it did not improve my wrinkles or dark circles
actually the lines around my eyes are more noticable to me
i saw no difference when compared to the philosophy product line
still i noticed more of an improvement from perricone's high potency eye cream especially on my dark circles
have seen a slight decrease in wrinkles
hasn't minimized the appearance of anything much since i started
some of the reviews indicated that this product had a strong "fishy" odor
during the 10 days of use i saw no noticable effects consequently the product was returned
have not seen any noticeable changes in my skin
this product has something in it that caused me to have an allergic reaction
the promise of diminishing fine lines
the problem area on my face was covered in bumps from a rosacea outbreak
what i notice is that it leaves like a corse film on my face not noticeable to the eye
still have no improvement
after a few days i noticed my skin seemed flaky
the oil absorbing had lessened
no different in the frequency of my pimple
no improvement in my skin texture
also didn't improve my complexion
seemed to not help my complexion seem clear
i felt like this barely provided any moisturization
really my blemish become firmer
my breakouts have not improved since using this
it did nothing to clarify the large pores on
i also still had the same level of redness around that area
raw skin following other cleansers however this was mild no trouble
i noticed a reduction in size
even the hyperpigmentation on my face was fading
it seemed to help with the acne
i also noticed that i had some little irritation bumps
no change in my acne
there are definitely other things that have a more significant effect for calming blemishes
my skin seems less clear
my skin became patchy
even toned without a hint of redness
which makes me worry the the effectiveness is being lessened
as far as redness goes
did nothing to improve clarity
it has a strong rose smell
i see a slight reduction of red bumps around my chin
my pores seem huge
caused me to breakout badly
it does seem to have reduced the redness from my acne
this mask caused me to have severe redness
didn't notice a difference in managing my breakouts
nothing we tride it 2 times i saw about 3 or 4 blackheads on in the mask in total
i noticed that there was black residue left in my pores making them look worse
i noticed that my blackheads were still there
nothing was even visible on the peel off.
there was no change in my skin after using it.
i wanted a product that was similar to black savage that i had seen on ig
haven't seen many results
didn't see any noticeable difference after using the mask
nothing concerning my blackheads/pores have changed due to this mask
i can notice it has blurred my pores
the mask hadn't removed anything or improved my skin in any sense
i noticed however that it is kind of week
it seems that a lot have surfaced up on the area
had major acne breakouts the next day
it makes no difference to my skin
left red patches which were visible the next morning
my pores looked no different
the texture was no smoother
saw no noticeable difference after months of use.
the one positive was that my skin seemed less oily
which has never caused me any problems
haven't noticed any changes in my skin
it did not improve any discoloration
saw no change in my skin or fine lines
could see a clear improvement overnight
i didnt notice any visible changes.
i noticed zero difference after 4 weeks of use against my fine lines
i dont really see visible results.
i dot notice any visible difference in my skins appearance or texture
some wrinkles around the eye area
have not noticed much of a difference
i noticed that it had created a deep wrinkle under one of my eyes
every day for the past 3 weeks only firms areas that show a slight amount of lines
dark spots are visible, and are multiplying.
i want to see more apparent results
this serum, however, was an anomaly.
haven't noticed any improvement in fine lines or sun damage
there has been no change at all
i don't notice any difference in wrinkles either.
i noticed no difference in skin texture or tone
i feel long term use has improved the condition
tone of my eye area
i also experienced some redness in my cheeks after using as well
there were a few occasions where i felt a little burning on my sensitive skin
actually accentuated fine lines and wrinkles
this was recommended to me after expressing my concerns for my acne prone face
seeing that there is shea
by day 2 i started noticing small breakouts
my pores seem to appear bigger
is very noticeable when applied
it hasn't helped my lines any
i didn't notice any difference in the way my makeup sat on my skin when applied before makeup nor did i notice any actual difference in the appearance of my under eye area with extended use day
something in this cream causes my contacts to become blurry
i noticed my acnes are appear again
general appearance of my skin has changed zero
made my skin texture worse
i am 28 and have uneven skin tone.
an actual break out is unusual
made pores appear smaller
i don't notice a dramatic difference with longevity my makeup or smoothness of the base
i see no difference in the smoothness
there was no difference
haven't seen a difference in fine lines either.
it actually made my forehead lines appear more prevalent
there is a white film that is visible after it drys
rate it a 5 star as it does make the puffiness disappear
however i had a similar problem with the white residue
also no dramatic results
instantly the firming/tightening effect was gone
also, it seemed to irritate my skin.
when i added make-up the wrinkles showed
still the residue remained
my wrinkles were accentuated
if i thinned it down a little for the white film not to show
the only time it smoothed my wrinkles was right after i applied it
the wrinkles were gone
my wrinkles reappeared instantly
i've seen no improvement in my neck appearance
it does seem to improve or lessen the deep wrinkles or creases on my face
if only there was no white residue
my skin appears to have a smoother surface.
perhaps that is the "tightening" effect
i've never experienced a worse breakout
this product only irritated my skin
congestion from the previous product
this caused the tiny rosacea bumps that are the bane of my existence
as i continue to use it throughout the week my skin has been getting worst due to breakouts
there were a lot more pimples on my skin
i noticed a difference in my skin tone after the first use however
there is no difference in fine lines
the only result i notice is my bank account beeing $85 lighter
blemishes have increased though
have seen no results
it has made no difference in my under-eye puffiness
it hasn’t lessened any of the fine lines that i was hoping it would diminish
there were no visible changes
fine lines were less noticeable
i would recommend only for those with mild under-eye shadows
dark circles still there
did nothing to reduce under eye puffiness
dark circles from anxiety
have never had an adverse reaction to eye creams/gels before
i saw no puffy eye or dark circle improvement
i think the wet-look even made my puffy eye more visible before makeup
have not noticed a difference.
i don't really see a dramatic difference after using day
i used it for a few weeks to no noticeable effect
this product did not have any effect on my under eye puffiness
my eye-puffiness is definitely lessened by its use
i saw no difference in puffiness under my eyes nor did i see it brighten under my eyes
seen no change after usage
i don't notice any difference in the puffiness below my eyes
i don't see much difference in my under eye puffiness
i dont see any decrease in puffiness under the eyes with this
there is a visible difference in puffiness
however there have been some issues
worse part is the smell
i liked how it brightened my under eye immediately
i don't see much change in my under eye wrinkles.
it appears as if the purple has risen to the surface of my skin
maybe after longer term than a small sample i would see visible results
i noticed strange little beads had formed under my eyes
i used it for a good month before it started to affect my skin negatively
hasn't improved my fine lines
the look of my eyes improved since the beginning
she showed me this product for a new eye cream
however at week 3 i have noticed that my under eye area has become dry
there is a slight shimmer
it has not been helping the appearance of fine lines due to aging
the result is visibly worse
i noticed very little difference in my under eyes
t's more cosmetic than actual skin improvement
i didn't notice any major results as far as reducing fine lines or reducing dark circles
other than the fact that it temporarily brightens because it has a kind of shimmer effect to it
as i see no noticeable changes
the pearlescent aspect of it isn't even so noticeable to the point to say it "camouflages" dark circles
i wouldn't have minded this if the product had diminished my dark circles
the main reason for the lower rating is that the pump stopped working while there was still a significant amount of product inside
my fine lines became more pronounced
i still use the skin brightening serum by caudalie which is remarkable however
there are some pretty signficant flaws in the packaging
it made my pores more noticeable
i also had redness
i see no difference in my fine lines
didn't seem to improve puffiness or anything noticeable
the smell... in an eye treatment... so puzzling!
have not seen any positive changes.
the small wrinkles around my eyes are still visible
not any less noticeable
this product did not reduce puffiness at all
didn't see any changes in wrinkles around eyes
there was no irritation
it provides a good amount of hydration however there is no difference with the dark circles
noticed that my under eye area was softer
it made my face itch, and caused breakout.
the scent lingered for a very long time
it has no long lasting effect
most creams/products that promise substantive visual change should be perceived with skepticism
while i dont have visible wrinkles
or at the very least make the line less visible
the only change i've seen in my skin is that it is softer
that's whats causing the worry line to be visible
no change in the appearance of my pores.
i don’t see any real improvement with my pores
never noticed any change in pore size
i noticed no improvement in pore size or skin quality
i suspected it was actually causing more pimples
experienced more whiteheads in those areas
saw no difference in pores.
shrunk them back to normal
perhaps smoothed down would help
really have seen no change in their appearance
my pores don't appear smaller or clearer
i do not have noticeable pores
nothing changed to my pore size on my nose
this product might have made my pores seem slightly less visible when i first put it on
i saw little-no difference
it looked like it mightve shrunk my pores
my pores looked the same on both sides--still big
have not seen a difference in the size of my pores
the only thing that it has done is reduced the redness around my nose
they are definitely visible
have not seen results
have not noticed a big difference in the size of my pores
they are still very visible.
the prior product more or less masked my huge pores
not due to the effects
also the effect wasnt that obvious
saw not even the slightest change
i've seen a slight improvement on other parts of my face
i saw no difference in the clearness of my skin or the size of my pores
on the positive side
i tried this cream with hesitancy due to the price
i saw virtually no improvement
i continued to experience some skin irritation
i've had a few post-acne blemishes that are being stubborn
to have a truer test comparison
it definitely does not work for firming/tightening
there is no difference in my deeper lines between my eyebrows
saw very poor results
either way i've seen no difference in my skin.
i don't have any age spots to diminish
long term i started noticing what seemed to be big zits/boils that never would surface or turn red under my skin that lasted months
my skin has always been clear
then use this there's no noticeable difference for me
no real breakouts with this one
i noticed that in general
i see no visible difference in my skin
saw no visible results in my skin
no discernible reduction in lines
not only did this product not have any positive impact on my skin
seems to have made some difference in fine lines/wrinkles
haven't seen any real results
have noticed the texture of my skin has improved
i noticed no changes at all except for an increase in clogged pores
the only noticeable difference that it made was that my skin is slightly softer when wearing the serum
no other improvements though
it was removed for some reason
it has a slight fishy smell
chin were still very noticeable
there were no significant warnings about the use of this product by people with oily or sensitive skin
still suffer the occasional breakouts
have seen no difference in my skin
have not noticed any results
smooth out my skin overall
while i havent experienced any adverse effects
splotches even more pronounced?
that was about the only positive
i don't think i saw any noticeable changes after using this product
my lines around my mouth were more pronounced instead of less
have been using algenist firming
i did not see noticable anti aging results yet
it is causing problems with my skin
previous one was light yellow-making me think that is coming from active ingredient
have noticed no difference
had wrinkles i would notice a difference
- did not reduce puffiness
did not reduce dark circles
i didnt see any improvement in the appearance of fine lines
saw no real improvements to my under eye area
haven't seen any results
sadly, i've seen no results at all.
i saw no effect
no difference in my fine lines and dark circles.
it made my dark circles look worse
caused little bumps under my eyes
has a substantial amount of alcohol
haven't seen changes but been using it everyday.
did not diminish the appearance of signs of aging around the eyes
after more than a month of use there is no real improvement in either puffiness or dark circles
watched my eye area gradually look worse
have noticed that my dark circles are the same if not worse
it also has a slight fishy smell that i think most of the algenist line has
my wrinkles or fine lines are still just as noticeable
i still have dark circles.
i saw no difference in fine lines.
bought one bottle and noticed a huge difference.
have never seen glitter in it
it may not be noticeable on pale skin.
this product did reduce the look of wrinkles under my eye
the most dramatic reason for this poor review is the ingredients
several are actually bad for skin especially around the eye area
sadly it exaggerated my fine lines
how a product with this significant a flaw ever made it to market
the white residue is a serious problem
it actually accentuates the wrinkles
i do feel a slight tingle when i put it on
haven't noticed any firming/wrinkle reduction
the tightness is gone
i don't have puffiness as a concern
lines are more pronounced.
also has a tendency to cause some eye irritation
well it made the puffiness under my eyes disappear
i felt it made the deeper wrinkles look more pronounced
this does seem to take down some of the puffiness under the eye area
pores will appear huge.
i wanted this product to work for diminishing the look of pores on my nose
my pores were visible again
i don't have super noticable pores
it promises to make pores seem less visible after just one use
my skin has definitely gone up a level in softness
my acne has never been worse
or changed color at all
i noticed new red bumps that weren't there that morning
i went from having clear skin to huge pimples
i noticed that my skin was more oily than ever
it has a slight lightening effect on the skin which is good
this was a massive disappointment
the scent was more pronounced than i would have liked
it slightly lightened the dark spots under my eyes
i see no difference in dark circles
"signs of age or stress"
i noticed no difference
at least i haven't experienced any bad effects
i saw no difference
on the eye i was using this one my circle got slightly darker
i don't think it has helped with brightening my under eye area
did absolutely nothing to improve signs of aging or puffiness
in terms of brightening or fading under eye circles
i unfortunately saw no brightening effect with this
i didn't notice any positive effects.
hasn't brightened or reduced circles
haven't seen much difference
i noticed fine lines slightly disappearing
my dark circles are still there
i noticed when i smile my lines aren't that noticeable anymore
dark circles haven't lightened
my wrinkles weren't severe.
it has not helped me with puffiness
lightened up my bags considerably.
i didn't notice any brightening or smoother appearance of any lines around my eyes
have had a lot of trouble finding an eye cream that doesn't cause a problem after continued use
saw no change whatsoever
i see no improvement to my dark under eye circles
no improvement to my dark under eye circles
while i didn't have the time to see the brightening effects of this
t was a gradual clogging of my pores i guess?
i didn't notice much difference with my redness
i start to see an improvement
it does however help with redness.
seeing as it was recommended for the chronically over-rosy
despite consistent use in the morning
i've not seen any results
no improvements on dark circles
i still had dark circles
it gives a slight brightness.
another disappointment- in regards to dark circles
it will start to diminish the look of them
it will show some sign of improvement
i saw no lightening of my under-eye area.
one positive was that the product has no scent
have seen no improvement at all in lines or dark circles
however after a month of daily use of cytocell i haven't seen any difference in the color of the dark circles under my eyes
i've noticed almost no difference in my under eye circles
i've never had issues with dark circles
no real brightening or firming.
no difference in lines or circles
have not noticed any difference
i don't see any firming or brightening effects
it did not improve crows feet or under eye wrinkles
great for people with no major eye area issues
i don't notice any improvement in fine lines
other than this i can't say i've seen drastic changes in my under eye area
no visible anti aging effects
my main concern is dark circles
i don't really see a noticeable difference in the condition of the skin under
i can't say that there was an appreciable brightening or tightening effect
two major point that led to the return of this product: bad smell
have noticed any differences in my eye area
nor repairing any subtle lines
i feel it helps keep the fine lines under my eyes from being so noticeable
i will say that it *dramatically* reduced the dark circles i have under my eyes
as well as provided some serious luminosity to my eye area
it does have some serious brightening agents in it
because i have had issues with eye creams before
it felt very sharp
i've noticed that other reviewers have said the packaging is deceiving
have not seen a significant improvement
don't notice any changes to dark spots or brightness
have noticed no difference in my skin whatsoever
not good for sunspots
i noticed the consistency on the top part is very watery
felt like that gave more visible improvements
this caused it to get really congested
to keep fine lines not visible under makeup
not to great dealing with puffiness!
i like this product as i saw it reduced my fine lines
haven't noticed any bad reaction with my bb cream
unfortunately it caused acne to form on the side of her face
the product caused a lot of irritation under my eyes
had no eye irritation
i didn't see any noticeable difference in puffiness
i am now experiencing dehydration
there has been no visible improvement
my primary concern is dryness under my eyes
hardly noticed a difference in my eye area...
did not diminish fine lines
am torn -it does make it smoother
caused some small bumps
haven't noticed any difference in my skin unfortunately
neither of us experienced any irritation
no difference in appearance as far as dark circles or fine lines disappearing
i noticed that the skin under my eyes started itching
i developed a few little bumps on my eyes -- milia
there was no firming.
the other there has been no change
it's had no effect on my dark circles whatsoever
haven't seen any radical results
there was a significant loss of firmness in my upper lids
i saw no improvement
i saw no improvements in lines or brightness
at first i thought maybe the redness is normal
leaving no unpleasant film
after using it for a long period of time it did not work to remove/fade any of the acne scars or hyperpigmentation
some spots seem more pronounced than they were before
have seen no improvement in the dark spots on my skin
this product did not reverse the appearance of dark spot or discolorations
noticed no difference at all
i see no sign of my scars waning
it has faded the spots somewhat
light pigmentation spots stayed the exact same
started noticing redness in the areas i was using it
this product did nothing to lighten or brighten my sunspots
they had lightened somewhat
the sales rep at sephora claimed it made a huge difference on her acne marks
i noticed my face color become brighter in 2 weeks
i not only have not seen any improvement in my dark spots
my mascara barely budged
other than the eye makeup
if there is a thing as negative rating
my skin has even been left with some deep
it also had a strange smell.
saw no improvement in my acne or skin tone
first i noticed not all my mascara was removed
irritated my skin significantly
doesn't have any discernible fragrance
it made fine wrinkles more noticeable
noticed no benefit to my skin
there appear to be no physical or psychological benefits to this product
face is usually clear
i didn't notice a huge difference in hydration
it gave me consistent acne
lingered like nobody's business in the hormonal spots
i felt no changes in my skin
saw no improvement in fine lines or brightness
i've noticed some breakouts with it
i only noticed a slight change in the appearance in my skin
my fine lines seemed even more visible
the only one i've used that has shown actual age-reversal in the delicate skin on the back of my h
i did not notice any significant improvement overnight
haven't noticed any of the benefits it claims
i noticed a definite change in the luminosity of my skin
i didnt notice a big change in my skin
never experienced any irritation using it on my eyes though
have not noticed a difference in the color of my eye bags
i do see a slight difference when using voice the moisturizer
i've noticed the dark circle
i did not see any visible results using this.
i've only noticed that it makes my under eyes look a lot brighter
my main issue is dark circles from allergies
maybe my first impression of the origins ginzing refreshing eye cream was negatively affected by the lack of citrus aroma
however noticed the coffee
i never noticed an actual reduction in the puffiness under my eyes
i did not notice a difference with dark circle or wrinkles
i never saw a difference in my zits
it did a great job at diminishing it overnight
barely noticed a change in the amount in the bottle
this has helped calm it down significantly
this didnt hurt my skin
actually increased the redness
i noticed some decrease in redness if i put some on a new pimple
after months of using it as directed on problem spots i saw no significant results
i don't find that it really diminished any blemishes
it made my acne worsen
it appeared to be praiseworthy
my acne is still there
this shows no signs of slowing it down
this does nothing to help diminish redness or to reduce pimples
have not noticed any improvements in my blemishes
have even had new pimples emerge by the mornings
the pimple is still there nothing different
i see no noticeable difference
no increase, but also no decrease.
the only thing it did was reduce the redness in my acne
combat some signs of aging
i also noticed no difference in my skin using this
no difference in skin texture, etc.
my pores appeared smaller
this did nothing to improve the texture of my skin
clearly this had issues
i found that it would overnight significantly reduce a pimple or completely bring it to the surface
i've seen no results in terms of wrinkle reduction or skin brightening
ed to the recent pimples i've noticed on my face which were never present before
i noticed my skin was more plump
i noticed that when i applied it
those pimples that are big
have not noticed any positive or negative effects
otherwise don't notice a huge difference
there were no improvements.
noticing my skin getting worse with breakouts i didn't have before i returned it
hasn't made my skin worse :
made my current small break outs worse
expected this to feel similar
i noticed most of my blackheads were gone
left an overall uncomfortable feeling
absolutely nothing noticeable happened with my skin
unfortunately it has not minimized the size of my pores in the least
i didn't have any noticeable improvement
i've never seen a change in blackheads after using it
there was zero change
saw almost no difference
notice a difference in pores
haven't noticed a difference in my pores
i saw no difference in my pores
doesn't have any noticeable smell
left me with no complaints
neutrals: as i didn't have noticeable lines around my eyes i can't comment on its ability to minimize lines
haven't seen any differences in dark circles
exacerbated any wrinkles after using for about one week
caused the eye area to get red
it made my under eye lines worse
however i haven't noticed any difference in my fine lines or dark circles
i've noticed it irritates my eyes from time to time
this worsened both of those things.
i did not notice any diminished pores
i didnt seen improvement in acne
it has clear the pores though!
no other change in my skin care routine
seemed like my skin absorbed a lot of the product
overall not a bad mask
there is a difference between feeling mositerized
did not notice significant improvement
the main downfall for this to me is the smell
caused an increased number of blackheads to break out in my t-zone
i don't see any noticeable changes on my face
didn't notice any major changes.
didn't notice huge skin benefits
didn't see a significant effect on my skin
needed something to clear up a recent breakout from stress
some with bigger red spots
the claimed effects on reducing redness
no noticeable results otherwise!
did not notice any overall skin improvement
like the clinique dramatically different
complexion got clearer and pores became smaller.
has a slight brightening effect on my skin
but i still like the tingling/ cooling effect.
also caused a few pimples
i didn't notice any brightening effects
it hasn't helped my dark circles
it doesn't have any visible effects
this did not diminish dark undereye circles
thought it was a little heavy for daytime
now i'm having a bit of discomfort
sustained reduction or dimishment of wrinkles
making wrinkles actually more noticeable
there has been no improvements in regards to tightness
i started noticing signs of aging around my 34yrs+ eyes
fine lines were less visible, too.
this yielded no results whatsoever
not see much improvement of lightening skin tone
have been experiencing quite a bit of flakiness
especially not compared to the regular moisture surge
my dark spots still were visible
i much refer the clinique dramatically different + yellow moisturizer
the packaging however is a big disappointment.
for the price i was expecting more noticeable results
can't say i've noticed anything significant.
i noticed no difference in skin
even though i experienced no benefits from it
lower may have marginally improved
without any further ado i will say that this product delivers minimal results
or at least somewhat noticeable ones
i felt the tightening that is mentioned
i saw zero change with regards to dark circles
my main problem area
i found that result strange
i also noticed that my eyelids seemed to be lacking moisture
have seen no difference in my upper eyelid
no diminishing of the slight crepe texture around the upper lid nor any noticeable overall firming or lifting effect
noticed an immediate difference
this product caused my eye area to feel tight
i didn't notice any dramatic results on my upper lids
the product definitely does tighten my upper eyelid
i didn't see any immediate impact
i saw no visible difference
i see a slight tightening effect
dries quickly i haven't really noticed the changes to my eyelids or dark circles
i didn't see a marked improvement in my skin after about 2 weeks use
no decreasing of fine lines
no major improvements seen.
i see no change in my skin
she hasn't seen any improvement with it
overall i liked the warming sensation
i saw no reduction in pore size or improvement in breakouts
haven't noticed any difference with my skin also the texture is different
one thing that is noticeable is the scent
i noticed no changes even weeks after using this:
saw no difference in my skin
there were no noticeable differences in my skin
visible pores this is way too mild
i saw no change in my skin
that everyone started noticing the difference in her skin
i don't see any sign of firming
like some people have already pointed out
that cream makes an instantaneous visible difference
the effect is progressively less interesting after that
hence the lines are less visible
i did notice a slight plump effect
hasn't caused any irritations or breakouts
there are no visible signs that i've switched moisturizers
have not seen any changes in my skin at all
think it might have created some blemishes
not even a slight brightening or one small wrinkle faded
noticeable i just wanted to give my skin a boost
i still have visible lines
it made my under-eye lines more noticeable
saw maybe a 10% improvement in the lower lid puffiness
have yet to see any improvement under my eyes where ihave wrinkles
i don't see any improvement to my disappointment
no change in tightening the skin under my eyes.
i saw a difference in 10 days like the outlined results say
i see more pronounced lines around the eyes with continued use
does help decrease dark spots
no noticeable change in appearance of my eye lids or the area under my eye
i saw no tightening effect.
without any expectations of wrinkle reduction
so far haven't noticed a big difference in the skin around the eyes
after four uses i have seen a significant rise in breakouts as well as more oil in my t zone
helped a little with redness
every time i apply it there is a slight burn for about 30 seconds
the oil became very noticeable
however i have acne prone skin
there just isn't a noticeable difference to continue to pay this much for an average product
the feeling was so unbearable
it did give me a pretty noticeable chilling/burning sensation
by the end of the day my skin is also patchy
i noticed a difference in 4 uses !
i didn't notice that it brightened my skin
noticed a really strong smell on my h
strong it was intolerable
i sadly saw no results
i also did not see much difference in lightening my dark spots from blemishes
it has also brightened my face a little
i still have blemishes
i noticed my skin was looking a little dull
i noticed no difference in brightening or complexion
the only thing is i havint really noticed a brightening effect on my skin
this product darkened my spots
made my pores huge
like some others noted
this mask caused a breakout
able to use this mask as an eye cream with no adverse reaction
it has actually helped clear up some acne problems he had been having
didnt notice any dramatic brightness or changes
i developed little bumps
it made my skin brighter after one use
haven't noticed any difference in my skin at all
i got like two huge crater looking pimples on my face
i really expected to see some sign of positive improvement in skin tone or brightness after two uses
i also didn't notice any of plumping effects that have been talked about
it makes my skin noticeably softer
since it hasn't caused any adverse effects on my sensitive skin i'm going to keep at it until the bottle is empty
nor do i notice any firming of my skin
there simply s no appreciable difference
the effect it has on my skin
have not seen any difference
saw nothing improved around my mouth
no change in my deep wrinkles or expression lines
don't have any major wrinkles
no lines have lessened
no wrinkles have disappeared
i expected to start seeing some results
haven't seen much improvement
the orange clashes with something
while i have seen results: my skin is definitely softer
i think it's also causing my skin to become more uneven
i saw no brightening effect
however this worsened with my oiliness as the day progressed
i can notice that my pores don't look as visible
then it goes back to being noticeably enlarged
it definitely helps significantly
still my foundation looks patchy
i see no difference.
i saw no difference with pore appearance
has a slight matte feel after application
although it felt light
it really hasn't had any noticeable effect on that at all
i didn't see a considerable difference
this had no effect on my undereye puffiness
only problem i found
it does slightly reduce puffiness
the menthol is so strong for the first few minutes that my eyes burn
i don't notice any difference in puffiness
i didn't see any results on reducing puffiness.
i did not see a noticeable difference in my under eye puffyness
still not a huge difference.
it is not drastic or great
i still have dark circles and my one wrinkle.
seemed to irritate my eye area after a bit
i did not notice any decrease in the puffiness of my eyes
not much for wrinkles or redness
this hasn't caused any negative reactions
unfortunately does not give substantial de-puffing results
my eyes were showing it
visually there was no improvement
i've noticed that my t-zone has been more oily than normal
as the name indicates
i saw some changes however it made me break out more on my cheeks
it caused light milia over the time
i only noticed a minimal difference in my dark circles
my dark circles are very noticeable
the results are immediate.
i would have liked it to provide more noticeable results
it did improve the texture of my skin
plus it did nothing to battle my first signs of aging
it also feels slightly firming.
i notice a slight improvement the next morning
i see no signs of real improvement in my skin
i also think this might've also created some tiny little whiteheads on my cheeks
i much prefer the dramatically different lotion
while i may be seeing some redness reduction right now
did not notice any changes in my skin tone
i didn't notice a considerable difference
haven't seen a huge improvement after 2 weeks of use
nothing about my skin has changed
it to see immediate results
there is no evidence of it actually absorbing into my skin
noticed a slight difference in the lines around my eyes
since starting the regimen by face has been covered in bumps
my skin has been stressed out lately
i didn't see any major good changes in my skin
there from previous acne
the situation continued to deteriorate
it did smoothen my skin significantly
i literally saw no difference
how so many people saw immediate results
that being said tidal faded them even better
after using it once i noticed that my skin had a slight break out
after using it i noticed my pores looked the same
i saw a slight increase in breakouts
i also didn't notice a difference in pore size.
both caused my face to breakout like no other.
not strong enough for acne scars
the redness has not subsided
it didn't make a noticeable difference on my skin
see no improvement in my skin at all
haven't noticed a difference in my skin
haven't noticed a difference in my skin
i didn't notice any major improvements in skin
i only have slight wrinkling around my eyes so didn't have anything to firm
i already noticed that some of the fine lines were turning thicker
i noticed my face looked brighter
which definitely has improved the look of my skin
i also did not notice any significant changes in my skin tone
after that the oily consistency is not noticeable
also this irritated my eyes.
haven't really noticed any change in my skin
very very slight improvement in fine lines
have not noticed any major results
the fact that i had no adverse reactions to it
i got this product in the hopes of making them fainter
does seem to minimize the deeper wrinkles on my cheeks to some degree
there was no improvement
that has reduced the appearance of fine lines by my eyes
i noticed when i applied makeup to the same area under my eyes
still no change in facial wrinkles
didn't notice any change in lines or decreasing of anything
have not noticed any real difference
have not seen decrease in forhead wrinkles
my acne did however somewhat diminish
i experienced some breakouts
it worked at clearing up some minor breakouts
which resulted in a serious acne flair up
this caused a lot of bumps and acne on my face.
haven't seen an improvement in my skin
it only made breakouts worse
if only it had helped with my pimples
most of my pimples had practically disappeared
i don't have serious acne
this product hasn't done anything to the few blemishes i have
i've noticed that combined with other face products
no positive results at all
also my pores have not been clearer since using!
my skin has even tone
might have reduced puffiness
there was no clear effect
i noticed little improvement in my skin
i noticed little difference in the hydration of my skin
i didn't notice any decrease in puffiness
didn't see a difference in my under eye puffiness after using
where was the tingling or something.
after using the mask, the sag was not noticeable.
i noticed no difference in the appearance of my eye area
no effect whatsoever when i removed
if my puffy-eye situation were a normal
i've also noticed that a lot of the ptr line smells really gross
my bumps were still there.
marks are still there
no improvement in dark spots or skin texture either
actual big zits that i haven't seen in over a year
that should of triggered my suspicions because wrinkle serums almost never come in this amount
made my current pimples worse
my face still hasn't shown any improvements
no difference is my skin whatsoever
there was a huge difference between using it vs
with noticeable spots of hyperpigmentation.
i anticipated some miraculous results out of this product
noticed a difference within a week of use.
have seen little to no improvement on my skin
i will say that i have noticed that my skin has softened up
my main problem with this was i hated the smell.
haven't seen any difference
i saw no difference
i noticed that my face was more matte
i rarely get a blemish
there were no discernible results
i don't see that my dark spots have been diminished or anything
skin tone also remained the same
suffered a bad reaction (redness burning, etc.)
my dryness has improved a bit.
my skin got progressively worse
in fact, it causes irritation.
have noticed no difference
the results not that obvious
while this did not encourage more redness in my skin
had a minimal effect on my skin
there is no actual effect
i didn't notice that using this mask made any significant difference to my skin
i notice no difference in my skin
i found this to be a little too drying around my noise
when you have acne problems
that the greasy film was more noticeable
i found that the "intense"
after 2 weeks i noticed that was was getting severely clogged pores on my four head
it also caused me to break out significantly on my forehead
saw no long term effect
did nothing for the puffiness.
it changed nothing about my dark circles
however there isn't much results from the product itself regarding darkness or brighten
this product seemed to make my dark circles more noticeable
my dark circles are caused by lack of sleep
overall, this product was slightly disappointing.
there wasn't a drastic improvement
my eyes have been looking worse since starting use of this cream
i don't notice a significant difference in reducing the dark circles
i did find an improvement in the appearance of skin under my eyes
there are brightening properties in the cream that makes the circles appear less dark during the day
however, my dark circles are still visible.
haven't seen any results
have yet to see any improvement for dark circles
although i have not seen noticeable improvement in my dark circles
hardly works in lightening my dark circles
the only two great thing about it are that it reduces puffiness from crying
haven't noticed any difference under my eyes
my dark circles are still there
i see no improvement whatsoever in my dark under eye circles
even some relief from puffiness
i can see a very slight improvement
which i have never experienced in an eye cream
i saw no results as far as lightening dark circles
as i have slight dark circles under my eyes
i saw no change
i also see no differences in the dark areas under my eyes
not noticable change in dark circles
has had no effect on the dark circles under my eyes
there was no difference.
no results seen yet as far as correcting my dark under eye area
have seen no improvement in my dark circles
the cream has definitely made my under-eye skin softer
have had dark circles
it did not have the same yellow color
i compared the two on my skin
it was just uncomfortable using it on my face overall
soothed the breakout that i had gotten
made the major breakout disappear
without any noticeable difference
hyperpigmentation i've been battling all through my 30s
no noticeable change whatsoever so i returned it.
not seeing any reduction
i've finished the bottle with no noticeable results
the acne on my forhead has reduced somewhat
the dark scars left by previous pimples have not been lightened
i saw no reduction in pigmentation
no reduction in zit appearances
saw zero difference in my dark spots and pores.
at the same time caused little red breakouts allover
it made my pores look huge
i still didn't see any improvements in discoloration or even texture
it literally made no difference whatsoever.
in that time i have not seen any improvement.
they were mostly positive
haven't seen any results.
my acne scars are exactly the same
i've noticed a reduction in oiliness, however.
over time i saw a little difference about the pigmentation of my blemishes
i only use this product on scars/blemishes now.
when i first bought it this product was effective in removing my acne to where my face was smooth with just a lot of acne scars
after experiencing a massive breakout from kate somerville eradikate mask i was guided towards this product by an associate
thanks but no thanks.
its has helped a bit with my acne
haven't actually seen an improvement yet
have noticed no results
overall good if you have black-head issues
this product has not helped clear blackheads as i expected
has helped improve my skin's appearance
it may have been a bad coincidence
i enjoyed the texture of the cream for a night treatment since it was heavier
found this to be irritating to my skin over time
stopped because the smell is too strong
the biggest negative for me
changes in my skin: not skin texture
saw no improvement or difference in my skin
for me no results has been seen
i saw no difference
my dark circles were still there
the first bottle had more of a watery consistency
also to top it off this time i haven't seen the same dramatic toning effects or noticed good quality like before
saw no skin brightening
although i could see some changes in my skin texture
have to find something else for my uneven skin tone
the only other drawback for me was that it hasn't really brightened my skin
i get considerably pale in the colder months
i seem to have gotten some minimal brightening from use
i saw no improvement
i didnt see any changes to my skin
there is no difference
the brightening effect is purely superficial
there is no long term brightening or lightening of dark circles
my dark circles never budged
it has a stinging affect on the eyes.
have seen no improvement
the rose smell was a little strong
had a serious allergic reaction under my eyes in the form of several small tiny bumps that took 3 days to resolve
i noticed a very very slight difference.
the instant brightness it claims to bring is debatable
in addition i have not noticed a difference overall in the appearance of my dark circles
it definitely did not diminish the appearance of my dark circles
very slight improvement after 1 month
have noticed no difference in the brightness of my under eye area
any visible differences after a week of applying.
while she did notice some pretty immediate tightening results
i will admit that since i've been using the face moisturizer the desert-like dryness of my skin has diminished somewhat
this has no smell
it has smoothed lines on my face
has no effect on toning
from the signs of it
so far it has improved the firmness in my skin
no discernible brightening of my complexion
in fact a bit to heavy
it has dramatically improved my skin
this product changed my skin instantly
to the point of aggravating the skin
causing a breakout or two
noticed after the third week of using this product that it has caused my skin to develop blemishes
it made the oil production worse
the initial process may cause a minor breakout
after using this product for over a month now i barely saw some reduction in oiliness if even that
have not seen any noticeable reduction in the size of my pores
definitely does not have any visible effects
the peeling was so noticeable people were commenting on it
i thouught it should have a more pronounced effect
the exfoliation was harsh yet seemed ineffective at the same time
haven't noticed any difference
i saw little to no results
it also gave my skin more of a burning sensation than a "tingling" one
i found the "tingling" to be quite intense
i noticed smaller pores
i saw no change- my skin was not 'brighter'
i didn't even see a glimpse of improvement in the skin around my eyes
overall, this product was a big disappointment.
it did nothing to reduce my dark circles
wouldn't flaunt that i saw any significant results
i saw no change.
my puffiness is unchanged
with some slight loss of elasticity
it caused me more problems
i saw no difference in using it
overall i noticed absolutely no change in the condition or appearance of my skin over approximately 6 weeks
i expected to see some brightening
it hasn't brightened my skin at all
overall i think there was some improvement
while i did notice a slight difference in the skin on my forehead
my 3 star rating reflects my satisfaction with the slight difference
however there were some unintended side effects.
both instances i had the same feeling of sticky skin
as the adverse side effects i don't like are nothing when i'm sleeping
no major complaints other than the price.
it doesn't plump up my skin or provide any particular glow or noticeable effect
there are less expensive moisturizers i've tried that have provided a lot more noticeable effect
i saw zero improvement on texture or condition of my skin
the same thing happened to him: big red splotches
my skin feels very nice after using it to wash however i have noticed an increase in small blemishes while using it
there is no noticeable scent, which is great.
i only gave a 3 because i did have some redness
the main negative is the price.
usage which i found surprising
i unfortunately did not see the benefit of diminished fine lines
with no noticeable changes in my skin
somewhat sticky serum with no noticeable smell
since it isn't having any negative effects
my fine lines are slightly less noticeable.
haven't noticed any substantial changed in my skin texture or tone
have not yet seen the desired results
have seen some results
i can see the changes in my skin
my skin tone overall has brighten
acne mark brown spots on my cheek so noticeable that i could tell only in just within a week
has no effect for the dark eye circles or the wrinkles just a good eye balm
dark circles associated with this problem
i don't have minor sagging under my eyes
slight difference in my under eye wrinkles
ever since using it my dark circles have become more pronounced
firming" improvement as it claims to do
i did not notice any brightening or anti-aging effects
i noticed wrinkles under my eyes
i still had to return it because of the bizarre wrinkles appearing
haven't seen any difference
had no issues with any allergic reaction
i've noticed a very faint stinging sensation as i apply
the dark circles that had been there were diminished
the sales person swore i would see dramatic reduction in puffiness in a week or so
except slightly smoother skin
it didn't minimize my blemish or make any difference whatsoever
my face was visibly red
clearly indicating that this mask irritated my skin
patchy after this mask
i also didn't notice a difference in terms of my blemishes
my breakouts were immediate after using this product
the level of hydration has changed
my skin had no issues with absorbing it
on the positive side
the product felt heavy on my skin
it caused major breakouts for 5 weeks
the texture has improved
i saw no noticeable difference in the condition of my skin after using this oil for a month
this didnt help reduce my scars
after continued use my pores looked visibly larger
my skin looked more uneven
not very visible on my skin tone after smooth out
no difference at all noticed.
have noticed no change to wrinkles or redness
so no improvement in my crow's feet
did nothing but accentuate my under eye wrinkles.
this product didn't do much positively or negatively
overall i like this cream
i did see an improvement in my skins texture
have not seen even a slight change
since i have seen that slight result
there has been zero change in any of my fine lines
it has noticibly improved the skin on my declotage
this morning i could see a visible reduction in my "elevens"
never saw any improvement :
i saw no change whatsoever.
can see improvement there
texture is smooth, as others have noted.
only mask the problem areas
haven't noticed any improvements
we though it made them noticeably darker
no reduction in puffiness or dark circles
it also had a stinging
if i noticed a difference
have noticed absolutely no positive differences
it has made the small lines under each of my eyes worse
there were no difference in my dark circles or under eye puff
haven't seen any changes :/
it still hasn't helped with dark circles
as soon as i put it on it caused a slight burning sensation
puffiness that was worse than i originally had
i did notice that it softened the skin under my eyes
this product severely irritated my eyes
after 2 months there was no visible difference at all in my eye area
my experience with this product has been very negative
my eyes look worse
don't have to have eye surgery
actually made the puffiness worse
it dried my skin out so much that wrinkles that had never been there before became huge creases
at first this serum seemed to be fading my scars at an accelerated rate
over time i saw little to no change
my scars have not changed at all
the new scar faded slightly
on the positive side i have noticed improvement of some older red marks/ scars
in the area around newer scars
i really don't see any difference in diminishing the acne scars i have on my chin
after 2-3 months of absolutely no change i discontinued noticing that i was developing even worse acne in the areas that i applied it to
this has made the texture of the scar worse
made it more visible
haven't seen any improvement more than a lighter skin in general
i've noticed no difference in my scarring
i never see my scar has some change
they said scar thickness was significantly decreased in four weeks:
100% of users had a significantly improved scar texture with increased smoothness
92% of users had decreased scar thickness after eight weeks:
significantly reduced scar thickness by 31% *results based on expert evaluations
i feel it has helped soften any previous scars
haven't seen any reduction the appearance of my blemishes
i also donot see any significant effect.
one a recent scar and one an old scar.
the newer scar actually looks worse.
saw little to no improvement
my scars aren't too big, but they are noticeable.
my complexion looks the same.
i think it has slightly improved the appearance of my acne scars i haven't seen a drastic improvement
it hasn't caused me to breakout
which has left me with a lot of scars
so far the results of them diminishing hasn't been dramatic
you can noticeably see uneven patches of makeup where you applied the serum
however it does reduce the appearance of acne scars slightly after 3 weeks
at first this item seems to diminish my pores
i notice my pores haven't change
my skin became accustomed to it
by the fourth application i experienced severe irritation
the redness reduction has been so dramatic
it's also made no difference in the appearance of my pores
i don't see any difference in my pores or any significant brightness in my skin
no change in my skin.
my pores are very noticeable
my main skin concern is visible pores
until results are seen
there is no positive change
also made my skin look
haven't noticed any difference in my pores
a bit dehydrated- as evidenced by more fine lines
i noticed my face beginning to turn red
zilch to shrink my piers' visibility
the redness no longer is an issue
i didn´t notice any change or improvement in my skin
haven't noticed any pore-minimizing results
the only improvement i see is that my blackheads are smaller
my pores haven't changed.
did not discern any noticeable differences in my skin
this one seemed lacking
i did notice more firmness
there is not any kind of lasting effect that i have noticed
may be better for someone with severe blocked pores
have not noticed a difference at all
see no difference in my pores
my undereye bags appeared more prominent
dark circles looked worse
haven't noticed any difference in my dark circles or fine lines
in the beginning there might have been a slight reduction in dark circles
perhaps it improved my under eye
i've literally seen no difference
saw no improvement in my skin at all
i felt only a very slight burning sensation from the retinol
i've used products with pro-retinols without negative effects in the past
started to notice increased puffiness
more puffy, creapy, and my wrinkles were deeper!!
noticed an almost immediate improvement
my dark circles have not diminished
and made my dark circles worse.
this one had an impact
i did notice a difference in the dark circles under my eyes
whether it be a slight stinging or tingling sensation
only have the beginning signs of crows feet
significantly crepe-like skin under my eyes
i didn't see any major improvements in any of those issues
i also wasn't noticing any negative effects
there were no visible differences before
in the meantime i have to moisturize constantly so the wrinkles caused by the dryness are less obvious
there may be a slight improvement in wrinkles
definitely not in the color correcting department of dark circles
i don't see any difference in puffiness
only a brightening effect if i'm actually wearing the cream
have seen zero results.
i did notice slight brightening
did not see a difference in texture or brightness of my skin
i wasn't expecting a drastic change or a miracle
i saw no difference.
does have an instant lighting effect because of the pigmentation
doesnt nothing for dark circles
i really haven't noticed any difference in the brightening department
i felt like it made the dark circles under my eyes darker
i don't see any firming or brightening
i didn't notice drastic improvements in my undereye circles
there was no brightening affect al
there wasn't any noticeable improvement in my dark circles or lines
the clinique is the only thing i've ever tried that reduces the appearance of my permanent dark eye circles
neither has made a difference in brightening the skin
i saw no change from this product
i saw no change in the appearance of dark circles in my under eye area
this made no difference
hardly having any melanin there
it has not helped with dark circles
have not seen any brightness under my eye area
it had a mild sting on my eyes
i am not seeing a big difference overall to my skin mainly my eyes where i put it
results are almost invisible after 2 months use
this product caused a rough
i started applying my dramatically different moisturizer over it
the problem seemed to be corrected
people claimed this brightened under-eye circles
i would say the coloration of the skin under my eyes is virtually unchanged
is that the faint lines i had before are now pronounced
more obvious lines under my eyes
have only begun to see fine line formation
i've not noticed any improvement
no noticeable difference either.
after using it one week i noticed some wrinkles
i also noticed it created little bumps on areas close to the eye
no change in my skin at all
the repairwear wrinkle correcting cream left dry patches under my eyes that were very noticeable when i put my foundation on
maybe i am still too young for it to have any noticeable affects
i do notice that the little crows feet i have are less noticeable
in terms of hydration there was no noticeable difference
it only irritated my skin
i didn't see a change in softness
can't see a dramatic difference
had an immediate reaction
not much improvement on pore tightening part
it has the consistency
no visible difference in skin texture/appearance
although my skin is now clear
it's not unbearable but it is noticeable.
it also irritated my skin.
i noticed small bumps all over my cheeks
i expected this to even my skin tone
i saw no difference in my skin
caused redness -- much better results with origins checks
i am a big fans of rose facial products
got a red bumpy breakout
it did seen to brighten my complexion.
my oil production has severely increased
i found i wasn't really seeing any dramatic results in my skin
my concern is premature fine lines
my wrinkles are still there
i saw no difference around my eye area
despite the obvious irritation
changed my skin tone at all
noticed my orange face
the "glow" is not perceptible.
my spots were lighter
my face looked brighter
another big problem i have
there is no noticeable scent.
only barely softened the look of my enlarged pores
no improvement with pores.
no improvement with lasting makeup.
didn't really see any noticeable changes
found no change in my sking
the firming effect is not bad
diminished fine lines -- not dramatic results
i saw no change in pore appearance.
tried it for months- saw no difference whatsoever
it did nothing to improve any fine lines or wrinkles
i felt nor noticed any change
no difference at all
the next day how visibly brighter it was
the texture of the product bothersome
like there was a very noticeable difference in my skin
it didn't have any positive or negative effects.
i find it not noticeable
experienced the same burning sensation
it has been shown to increase cell death
the whiteheads stopped emerging
the only thing i noticed was that
there was no difference in my skin
i did not see a noticeable difference in my skin
that radiant effect is no longer there
5 months withouth seeing any improvements
showed better results on my skin
the changes were visible after two applications.
i mainly was attracted to the spf 50.
see no difference in my skin whatsoever
my skin had a slight tacky sensation afterwards
i did not notice any discernible improvement in my skin
not even softness or improved tone/clarity
it caused me skin issues
have noticed a slight improvement in my overall skin appearance
my skin improvements are not as noticeable as other products that i have tried in the past
it made my wrinkles disappear
the pimples occurred only on the places where i had placed the serum
i didn't notice any "radiance" or change to my overall skin texture
this is the only change in skin care routine i've made
made my skin brighter
because like many others have noted
i noticed no difference.
also caused me numerous breakouts after having clear skin for a while
my skin is full of acne something unusual in my skin
i did not notice any signs of tightening visually after a month of using it
has caused my skin to become very patchy around my cheeks
i noticed after prolonged use that i did some breakouts around my jawline etc
doesn't leave any visual or tangible residue.
i noticed that it actually worsened the appearance of my skin
thankfully it was temporary
i see a small difference in that my skin looks healthier
my skin's texture has not improved at all
i've never had bumps or acne or any other types of skin problems
i looked for any progress, but there was none.
noticed no difference whatsoever in the appearance of my skin
this was nothing compared to a peel.
i did notice that my skin was cleaner.
is quite noticeable after application
my fine lines were more visible after using also.
i see no improvement at all
who prognosticated to me that i will have rosacea because i have few broken capillaries barely noticeable in my face
the only areas that tolerated this product was on my neck
that isn't surprising since it has rough pieces in it
my skin did not improved
i noticed that by pumping 5-6 times i had made a huge dent in the bottle
haven't seen a difference at all
an absence of "wow" factor
the scent is a major turn-off.
i am not suggesting this overall
i tested how long the smell lingered
been using it for two weeks now with no noticeable change except for the new blackheads i received
the product seems to do a good job of reducing my puffiness
there is not a noticeable difference
i do not have a major problem with puffiness
there was nothing distinct about it.
neither did i notice any illuminating effects.
i didn't see clear brighten effect.
it left no results in terms of brightening which was my main concern
which i found quite strange as i always remove my eye makeup prior to cleansing
never had more than the occassional pimple
however unaffected parts of my face looked great
this was a major disappointment.2.
there has been no noticeable change in skin tone or texture
i now have six huge blemishes
i saw great results with wrinkle reduction
i noticed nothing new with my facial skin
no other skin concerns
there is a slight positive change to my skin texture
fine lines- which used to be barely visible- are now extremely evident on my forehead
it also caused me to breakout on my checks
skin complexion did not improve
texture did not improve
i get a slight stinging sensation in my skin every time i put it on that almost feels like something in this is irritating my skin
although i did notice my facial lines were softened
it sort of plateaued by the end of the bottle
have had no changes
see improvement in softness
i noticed some texture in the areas
the pores are less apparent
haven't noticed any difference
i guess there is a placebo effect of feeling proactive about my eye area
i've recently been noticing dark circles under my eyes that make me look tired all the time
have not noticed a difference
it did not dramatically reduce my dark circles or puffiness
this product increased my eye puffiness markedly
see no improvement in my fine lines
the same puffy feeling happened
dark circles it made the few fine lines that i had worse
still waiting for some type of reduction with my dark circles
no other skin concerns
there is a slight positive change to my skin texture
fine lines- which used to be barely visible- are now extremely evident on my forehead
some brightness in under eye area
no difference in discoloration that i have at the corner of my eye
i honestly have yet to see any noticeable results from this eye cream
my eyes seemed brighter
i did not see any visible changes around my eyes after using it for about a month
there is no difference whatsoever in any aspect of my aging eye area
in fact, i have noticed some new fine lines!
seen 0 changes in my under eye circles
i did not notice any major or slight difference in my eye area
i see no difference with dark circles
no other skin concerns
there is a slight positive change to my skin texture
fine lines- which used to be barely visible- are now extremely evident on my forehead
there were no improvements
i would give it negative stars or just no stars
after 2 uses i noticed a small area of irritation
my skin hasn't changed any since using it either
the formulation seems to have changed
eye shadows no problem
hardly removed any makeup
i've noticed that products which contain grape seem to anger my skin
the smell was overwhelmingly bad
in terms of performance, it is severely lacking.
more like dramatically greasy
dramatically different does not work for my combination skin
while i haven't experienced any negative side effects
light moisturizer that has soothed my skin of noticeable redness
in hopes of making my dark circles less noticable
the only result i've had with this product is red
i see no differences
no visible long term benefits from consistent use
my skin hasn't been this slick since high school.
i've also noticed that i get whiteheads with it as well
my skin has not improved at all
overall it felt heavy
it is definitely noticeable
i could not get over the strong fragrance that never dissipated
i noticed a drastic increase in small bumps
there is also nothing that would affect visible pores like they claim
the strong fragrance with clearly related breakouts made me return this
noticeable acne scarring on my cheeks
night for months with no significant difference in my skin tone
it hasn't "corrected" anything
it made my skin look worse as the weeks passed by
very faint wrinkles starting to creep in
made my breakouts worse
haven't noticed anything different
blemishes have lightened maybe slightly.
there was noticeable shine on my t-zone.
the smell is unfortunately still lingering
caused even more breakouts
however the 3 star rating is because it didnt correct the appearance of unevenness i had in my skin or help with the pores or breakouts or acne marks
for bigger acne problems
saw no improvement in my skin it actually got worse
my skin would improve
the texture of my skin changed for the worse
they did improve my skin texture which has been damaged due to picking
haven't noticed any changes in the acne or rosacea on my cheeks
still persisting they aren't lasting as long
i also notice that the hyper pigmentation from past acne breakouts on my right cheek is slowly starting to fade
there was no improvement or clarity
with no lasting negative effects
i couldn't see any measurable positive results either
hardly noticed a change in my face
my verdict is: i see no difference in my skin whatsoever
no difference at all!!
too many steps to follow without any real notable or amazing results
experienced a very unusual breakout along the jawline
after using this product i noticed in a 10x mirror that makeup still remained in some pores
texture of my skin in visible ways
it also did nothing to the blemish
i felt tightness a few minutes after putting it on
the smell is almost intolerable
if you aren't adverse to the strange scent that is
may have even caused a slight break out
i see no difference between normal
my skin was clear prior to using this product
makes my fine lines seem more noticeable
after a week my skin became really uneven with read patches starting to develop around my nose
now my skin is noticeably softer
it hasn't effected them yet
yet no noticeable effects like my other more affordable cream
my face is noticeably smoother
noticed some changes on my skin
fine lines with some pores that have become more noticeable recently
with no reaction whatsoever).
did not diminish dark circles as stated
i noticed great results with this eye cream as prior i was having a lot of issues with my concealer sinking into fine lines
this definitely diminished this effect
i don't see any noticeable difference though.
it hasn't helped with fine lines or wrinkles
while it slightly addressed my dark circles
i didn't notice any visible reduction in elasticity
it had no effect on my dark spots
it had zero effect on my dark spots
any effect this had on my hyper-pigmentation was negligible
i found that this product helped prevent my skin from more dark spots caused by acne
my parents both have large sunspots on their faces
i did see an improvement in my skin tone
i found no lightening effect what-so-ever
have not seen any difference in my skin
i saw marked improvement in one large sun spot on my face
some improvement in a few smaller marks too
there has been no improvement whatsoever
still no difference in my dark spots
all it did was temporarily increase my glow
it did nothing to improve my skin tone
there is no improvement in either dark spots or areas of redness
it caused more acne marks then it corrected
however i haven't seen any observable differences in my skin
so far there has been absolutely no difference in my hyperpigmentation
haven't seen a change at all
there is no result after using this mask.
i expected more noticeable results for the money
turned out to cause extreme redness
it barely dented the "armor" so to speak.
no reduction in redness, no softer skin.
given the lack of results
saw/felt no noticeable increase in hydration
dryness was just as prevalent as prior to use
haven't noticed any difference in my skin
haven't noticed any long lasting results
have not noticed a real difference
each time experienced similar results
as the days progressed i noticed my face looking duller
i also believe this is causing some breakouts.
they're not too noticeable
saw no difference between the cream alone
i didn't notice any visible firming at all
then to make matters worse it caused mild breakouts in my chin
this turn out to be a huge disappointment
visually, i see no change at all.
after using it my two cheeks had two big acnes
some dark spots from previous breakouts
i also noticed a slight break-out
then i started noticing a lot of blemishes
my skin improved greatly
i saw no changes in the skin around my eye.
i still have the same wrinkles and dark circles.
no reduction in dark circles
i've never had this problem with other eye creams
on "bad" days the puffiness is still not diminished
recent icy blasts have played havoc with skin.
with no huge benefit yet
it felt like it tightened my skin
it made my pores look huge
i did see an overall change in the skin under my eyes
dark circles are gone!
i did see a change in my overall skin tone
i splurged because since i've turned 30 i've magically noticed my wrinkles becoming very defined
didn't see any major changes
i did notice a bit of clarity to my skin
this gave me wrinkles.
and they are very visible lines.....
skin texture worsened also.
noticeably minimized my pores
i don't see any improvement for my under eyes other than a little brightening effect
the marks were still there
didn't notice a positive difference
also the smell alone is not pleasing
that same distinct smell
fresh with an ever so slight cooling effect
no other skin concerns
there is a slight positive change to my skin texture
fine lines- which used to be barely visible- are now extremely evident on my forehead
found no difference in the darkness of my under-eye circles
there is no noticeable effect.
brightening or dark circle reduction
insisted not only does it visibly helps with dark circles
never noticed much of a difference
it did not make any significant difference.
haven't seen a significant difference
have seen no result
saw no difference to my under-eye
except for that my under-eye wrinkles were getting more noticeable
reduction of under eye circles
i feel that this has made my undereye creases more emphasized
t may not be visible under makeup
no noticeable effects on puffiness
noticed my wrinkles grew noticeably longer
make its application look obvious
nothing, no change whatsoever.
haven't noticed much improvement in my dark circles
i saw no difference.
unfortunately it would cause severe redness in my cheeks after using it for a few days
have not noticed any difference in my skin using this product
have not noticed any dramatic change to my skin
nothing changed at all
i didn't have any negative effects though.
this has been such a disappointment.
there is no improvement whatsoever
on the opposite i noticed more uneven skin tone
firming is far superior in my opinion
however have not really seen any major changes with lines in face yet
i fortunately don't have any visible fine lines yet
the wrinkles between eyebrows are not as noticeable as before
the product inside has a cream -gel consistency i do not yet notice an increase in skin firmness
after the 20 days i saw no real difference
i am 38 with no major wrinkles
i noticed no differences in my skin after using the mask
there is no visible results
the mask was hard to get even due to its texture.
never noticed any differences
i saw no change after peeling
at first glance, there is glitter in the mask.
found no improvement in my skin
i saw little difference in my skin; 2.
i noticed no other results
the mask doesn't produce any noticeable results.
i did not notice any reduction in pores.
i mainly got it because it said it helps uneven skin tones
it stung slightly upon application
i noticed with using this mask in that our skin looked brighter
however i have not seen any difference since i've used "skin rescue deep cleanser with red clay"
didn't notice any improvements in my skin tone -- same amount of breakouts
did nothing to prevent the occasional blemish.
i did not notice any help with enlarged pores
my face experienced a breakout at the eyebrow
im not noticing any significant changes in my skin
by midday my pores looked huge
it also caused me to have 4 huge pimples by the end of the day
however i didn't really notice anything noticeable when i woke up
i saw very obvious changes in my skin tone
though the scars haven't vanished
they have definitely faded
i saw no difference except that it made my skin look
evening of skin tone is also not there
my complexion is not brighter
i felt like the benefits were minimal for the price
this is a stronger reaction than i've had to any serum
saw the bumps disappear within 2 days
it hasn't done anything to improve the appearance of my age spots
there was no change to my spots
noticed slight change at least on the right side of my face
am totally indifferent because of no noticeable changes
i like the product it has a slight tingle felling when applied
since i stopped the burning sensation reduced
i do not have wrinkles or sagging skin around that areas
all i want is an eye brightening
hasn't changed my dark circles either.
noticed reduced puffiness for a few weeks
it has made my dark circles worse
it didn't make any positive difference
it didn't address my puffiness
now they are more pronounced
there is a slight brightening effect from the black tea
while the darkness has neither gotten lighter nor darker the fine lines have deepened
would have been nice to alleviate some of the burning
dark circles were completely unchanged
no improvement in puffiness
no difference under eyes
had a slight off putting smell
expecting to see some effects in the morning as far as minimizing my normal dryness
there are no lasting effect
my pores were so big
no redness any more
this made my skin irritated
there was so much redness in my face
thickness of the product overall because in the end there is hardly anything in the bottle
i didn't see any immediate differences
the glamglow hydrating treatment resulted in no noticeable effects on my skin
very rich in moisture but no noticeable effects.
my skin had a bad reaction to it
the fine wrinkles under my eyes seem to be more prominent
my eye wrinkles weren't as noticeable
my negative comment has now been removed twice!
i already have my eye cream.
have not noticed anything different with my skin
i still have an uneven skin tone
it blurred my eyes so bad
first it blurred my vision instantly.
too bad this caused a mild breakout.
le my eyes since i've never had an issue with it making my vision blurry
t blurred my vision for about five minutes
there was still traces of foundation on my skin
did not cover the unevenness.
i notice a huge difference the moment i put this on my skin
lines were still visible
i noticed no difference
improving the appearance in my under eye area
to get any significant difference in my pore
really blurs the appearance of the lines
if you feel that you have glaring "imperfections" that need to be "blurred"
noticed it got rid of some of my acne marks
i saw no difference in my skin with this product
the initial application is a little unpleasant
prevent visible signs of aging
adds a slight sheen under foundation
didnt notice much of a difference in the appearance of my skin
however this product was horrible on my skin.
it caused the most massive breakout i've experienced in years
i've notices its a bit clearer
this did not "instantly illuminate my complexion" or eliminate any of the winter dullness i've been experiencing
have notice no difference in my skin whatsoever
never saw any improvements
doesn't really do anything noticeable to my mostly clear
smoothing of my skin made the overall the experience fine
i so no improvement in texture
leaves me with a slight white cast likely because of the spf
i did not notice any changes in my complexion
haven't noticed any improvement about uneven skin tone after 8 weeks
for me this product made no changes in my skin.
there has been no improvement in texture
however i noticed no change.
i got it because i had such a great experience with the facial mask
i instantly noticed a difference
it made my dark circles worse
my wrinkles aren't as deep or as noticeable.
the color wasn't too noticeable when worn under makeup
it just seems like an extra step without any noticeable results
after being color matched
it has a slight colour to it
this actually highlighted my puffy eyes
there are only two shades
also made my undereye area look
i don't notice anything negative
although it may diminish puffiness
i don't see any brightening effect
i didnt notice any hydration whatsoever
no noticeable hydration or softness.
there is no difference.
in contrast the 24k gold which has may of the same claims as this mask leaves my skin bright
i don't notice any change in skin's appearance
results: both methods made my skin react with a little red bump
the vagueness caught my attention.
despite my research largely pointing to that 'science' being an exaggeration at the least
my skin looked a bit brighter
i notice that my skin is softer after using it
a slight difference in fine lines
something was giving my skin a negative reaction
narrowed it down to this product as being the culprit
it i had a skin reaction to it
others indicated there was a noticeable improvement
i discontinued use and the problem persisted.
only the sides of my face are affected
the moderate rating was due to two things: 1
it became obvious it was due to whatever fumes/scent/essence were in the cleanser
cause major breakouts along my cheeks.
while i love the smell i haven't noticed any changes to my skin
my skin's condition improved dramatically while i was using it
i noticed fewer blemishes
did not notice any improvement in my fine lines or pores
color is too obvious.
it has a slight yellow tinge
the pigment has separated or gotten darker or something
overall perrine has changed their formulas
i did not notice any discernible difference using it alone or layered/mixed with other products
it irritated my skin around my jawline which has never happened before with any product
made the lines around my eyes look worse
it did not resolve my issues with puffiness
have not noticed even the slightest difference
i also placed it on the bridge of my nose because i was experiencing breakouts
the first time i used it i noticed small red bumps under my eyes
i did notice improvement in my dark circles
it gave me minor milia
no effect on dark circles or fine lines.
even without the reaction on my skin i noticed no improvement with fine lines or darkness under eyes
doesn't provide any visible results
used up the whole jar, no noticeable difference.
i've actually seen my eye area improve with a change up in my other products
don't notice any significant difference to my tired eyes in the morning the product description also says it has a nice scent
haven't seen it under conceler or foundation
it tends to burn more after i have recently taken off my eye makeup
had/have some crows feet concerns
the dark circles under my eyes aren't super noticeable
no improvement in tone nor texture.
my spots lightened very slightly
it hasn't improved anything at all
the skin underneath was indeed lighter
i didn't see any more dramatic results than i have with other treatments
has not caused minor breakouts
my dark spots became darker as expected
my pores were definitely less visible
even though there were some blackheads
there was no noticeable difference on my face
barely made a difference for me.
for someone who has really visible blackheads
you will see the amazing difference in how many blackheads are removed
look noticeably smaller the next day
i could feel my pores being tightened
i saw an improvement in my blackheads for about a week after using this
whiteheads that have been there
significant difference can be seen with my dark circles
i immediately noticed a difference.
my eyes were brighter and smoother looking.
you could noticeably tell where i applied the day cream
there were actual flakes of skin coming off
there were bumps all day
night since the am portion makes my fine lines more evident
the pm is fantastic: made my eyes appear smoother
too many of us have that negative affect.
right away i noticed a positive difference in how the area around my eyes looked
so my positive experience turned negative kind of quickly
has helped tremendously even after a few applications with puffy allergy eyes
i saw no change in my skin whatsoever besides the fact that it was red beyond belief
i noticed an improvement in the look of my skin after the first use
have noticed immediately after removal how soft my skin is
i noticed that it left a slight film on my face
noticed small breakouts all over my cheeks
the only upside was the smell
i also felt the stinging
i felt some slight stinging
saw no difference in my skin
one star deducted due to bad packaging
however i never noticed any difference in my skin
i saw no change in wrinkles
i tried this for an extensive period with little improvement of the eye area
slight bags beneath the eyes
on top of that i already have wrinkles that come with allergies
but it seems some have noticed changes quickly.
i found no difference
it had a somewhat soothing effect however
so puffy is definitely in my list of complaints
no major reaction, just more teary than usual.
i felt the product did help with puffiness
certainly noticeable after five applications
when i woke up in the morning they seemed more noticeable
i feel like it accentuated my fine lines
i didn't see marked improvement in hydration or skin elasticity
my eyes aren't noticeably less baggy or tighter.
the wrinkles are still there.
there is no difference
see no results whatsoever
made them more evident
it has certainly been "changed" or reformulated
have used many without any negative reaction
the other lumiwhite product does work- i noticed improvement after using it
there is no noticeable difference in my dark spots
no changes to the dark spots at all.
on the positive side
on the negative side
left somewhat of a film on top of my skin
if i had miraculous results
it still hasn't absorbed
i never noticed a difference in the lines under my eyes
haven't seen any improvement on my skin
there were zero improvements to the texture
wish i could've seen some positive impacts
noticed no improvement in my skin.
)haven't noticed any changes.
i still haven't replaced it.
it showed no improvement in radiance
it has made no difference
i also believe it may be the culprit of a few itchy bumps on the side of my cheeks
no noteworthy results or improvements
i've never been a big bobbi brown fan
it would make my vision blurry
overall love the was
made my eyes look worse
so they were real wrinkles
i noticed no improvement in fine lines
i saw none of these effects
i didn't see any significant improvements for my complexion
it also had a bad smell
brightening or firming like it promised
had no issues with it burning
it didn't leave any noticeable difference
saw no real long lasting results
was surprised by how much ineffective the 1 minute facial was for me
this did nothing noticeable
i've also noticed more breakouts.
little to no acne concerns
i don't see an obvious improvement in my skin in terms of brightening
it caused a few bumps on my face
i didn't see any real noticeable effects
it didn't caused any outbreak or irritation
i noticed no difference in texture or clarity.
the smell of alcohol was way to strong.
my skin is still dull with uneven texture.
still have uneven skin tone
after noticing no difference in my skin while using it under other products
i see no change whatsoever.
there is no visible benefit
whenever my skin has problems
could improve my skin tone
it was fine for the first few days until i noticed the increase in the number of pimples on my forehead
does make give me slight acne if i use multiple days in a row
haven't noticed any huge differences
i did however notice a few extra pimples showing up
they have since subsided
this did nothing to help with redness
its just not for me mostly due to the eye sting
i don't see any reduction in redness
it did not reduce the redness
it did not reduce the appearance of my wrinkles
i feel pretty let down since i didn't notice any immediate reduction in the redness of my skin
i don't notice any reduction in redness
i don't see much of a redness-reducing effect
which would then leave an slight oil layer on my face
as others have noted the texture is thick
since using this product i feel like i have seen an increase in my under eye lines
i didn't notice any significant improvement
i noticed no difference around my eyes
i saw no effect whatsoever
this anti-aging eye cream has done nothing to improve anything about my eyes
had no results with this cream.
i don't see any reduction in redness
my skin seems to be slightly irritated by this
it seems to have caused some minor break-outs
thinking my skin was adjusting
see no difference in my dark circles or fine lines
at first i noticed a slight improvement in my undereye dark circles
don't seem to have diminished at all
my main concern is keeping the eye area hydrated since i have dark circles
also there was no instant firming.
my dark circles are constant
have seen none of the anti aging benefits
my skin has shown no improvement with this product
caused my foundation to be patchy
this serum however only slightly smoothed skin.
the darker spots are emphasized
in fact the texture of my skin did not improve
have not seen any improvement
i always have bad marks left over from acne
in the morning saw a brighter looking complexion
i do see some fading
i noticed considerable brightening
some parts of the eyes
haven't noticed much change in regards to dryness or texture
i am only 35 no major wrinkles
a few pumps makes a noticeable difference in the liquid level
it didn't change my redness in the slightest bit
seemed to make my fine lines more pronounced
i noticed no improvement in my overall complexion
saw significant results right away
this mask did nothing to improve my skin condition
this mask has no effect in summer or winter.
saw no difference in skin
i unfortunately saw no discernible change or visual improvement in my skin
i increased the amount significantly
still saw no results
i saw no difference to my skin.
all i got was an almost unnoticeable tightening effect
probably created by the dehydration going on due to this ingredient
ended up with a crusty cover with no discernible results or reduction in wrinkles
this has a tightening feeling
i saw zero difference in my skin
saw no change in my skin with it
skins been significantly dried out lately
it made my scars appear darker
my pores were noticeably less congested
noticed that i was getting a lot of texture
did nothing to lighten my pigmentation
the texture still remains
i can feel my skin immediately tightening
unlike this promising overnight mask
have not noticed any change
until i noticed it turned to a clear film
i could not see a noticeable difference
noticed i had small break outs around my cheeks
i saw no noticeable firming effects
the price tag seemed a little steep
other than a breakout i'm concerned was caused by it
i got a serious allergic reaction to it.
i noticed no change in my face
don't feel like it minimized the appearance at all
i didn't see any significant improvement
haven't seen any of the softening i had hoped for in what are truly fine lines
5 stars for the immediate smoothing
night for slightly over a month with no visible results whatsoever
around my eyes which are not pronounced
though impact is minimal
i did see improvement of minor wrinkle areas.
less noticeable almost immediately
with not the slightest improvement
maybe it will make my lines a little less noticeable
no change in skin texture even.
no reduction in fine lines
there has been zero results
the beginning of deep wrinkles in between my eyebrows
saw almost immediate results
absolutely no affect on my fairly minimal wrinkles
haven't seen any improvement
there has been no change at all to my wrinkles or skin
sadly, i saw no results.
haven't seen any great improvement yet
saw no changes at all
absolutely no visible difference
i saw considerable softening of some fine lines on my forehead
some minor softening of smile lines no change in frown lines
i noticed more of them
it can provide an illusion of lines being diminished-- just as regular makeup can provide an illusion of skin that has less discolorations
it did not improve wrinkles.
i did like the improved appearance to my neck/chest
i can honestly say there is no reduction in my minimal forehead lines or crows feet
the lines seem temporarily slightly softened
it caused serious breakouts
the texture of my skin changed
i seen no real difference in my skin using this
i noticed many more pimples forming
nothing noticeably different happened except more breakouts
didn't notice any decrease in pore size.
without leaving residue or affecting my eyes
my sun spots more obvious
blackheads have always been an issue in the past
it ended up being lack-luster
have no skin concern
i didn't notice any difference in my skin texture or reducing fine lines
did not notice any change in fine lines/wrinkles or dark circles
i actually think this product made the puffiness under my eyes worse
i saw no positive changes in terms of dark circles or lines
made my eye bags worse.
still have dark circles
my dark circles are slightly lighter
other than seeing improvement of my dark circles
i subtly started to notice that it looked like the bags under my eyes were fuller
haven't seen any difference at all
while the facial left no result this made my skin softer
i developed little non-noticeable bumps
only noticeable with foundation on
this helped decrease my milia so much
buy some coconut oil that has helped my skin drastically in the past
it did nothing for redness
the redness in my skin was gone
texture of my skin was significantly improved
when my bumpy friends became permanent fixtures on my face
it caused so much damage it have to wave the white flag
my rough texture may have improved slightly
no difference at all in skin problems.
have not seen a drastic change
noticed no major difference in my skin
no tingle, nothing like it claimed.
didnt get any positive result either
it also caused tightness
ignoring the obvious signs that this was not a good cleanser for my skin
i also noticed little bumps that have appeared on my forehead
noticed that my face was stinging in that spot
i saw all the positive
no drastic changes to my pores or the texture of my skin yet
made my skin worse
found her fine lines reduced
no firming, no reduction of lines or wrinkles.
unfortunately after using it for about a month i haven't seen or felt any noticeable difference in my skin
have noticed more signs of aging since i started using it than before
after using more than half of a bottle i have noticed zero change
there has been no other significant improvements to my skin -- good
when the artist at sephora introduced me to this product you could see the visible results right there
i figured some improvement might occur
if you are serious about eye de puffing
this product made my eyes irritated
i did notice my skin to be smoother
i see no visible difference under my eyes
the puff off eye cream was just such a disappointment in comparison
the short story for my eyes is that i have two very distinct lines/folds/creases
none have worked in even diminishing the creases
i even put it under one eye only as an experiment to see if there was any noticeable change
that's mostly the extent of it
it does not decrease puffiness
helped a very small amount with the puffiness
to conceal dark circles there are other better products than this one
made them so much more noticeable
i also saw no smoothing.
not sure i see brightening or tightening effects
no noticeably softer skin
there were so many blemishes in number
at least there are no more huge breakouts
leaving your skin looking slightly blurred
i didn't see any positive changes in my skin after using the whole bottle
i started noticing my skin getting worse
have seen no change to my skin
as though i had no fingerprints after use
i see no difference in fine lines
i'll stick to other products which have given visible results after even one use
i didnt feel any tightness or lift.
this is how poor the consistency and texture was.
i did notice my lines around my neck to soften
look less prominent than prior to use
also known to cause premature wrinkling-it has no skin benefits
i've seen real results with that mask
don't really see any difference regarding firming
hard to get off and no noticeable result.
however i didn't have a noticeable change in my skin
i didn’t notice any of that i do feel a slight “firming” or “tightening” sensation when i use it
saw no results at all, not even the slightest.
it bothered my eyes
there was no visible difference or anything.
otherwise no major acne problems
my face is visibly red in only the spots where the mask was located
i think it has a distinct
i saw many good ratings
it unfortunately made my 47 year old skin look even more tired by accentuation sagging
noticed my skin drying dramatically as the day went on
have only gotten more noticeable as i've aged
even if it's a slight change
felt that my crows feet were more pronounced
there had not been any changes with my dark circles
dark circles are still visible
dark circles did fade a tiny bit
that means there was a significant improvement
it claims to visibly brighten
reduce appearance of dark circles
it only lightened them slightly
never saw any lightening of the dark circles
those little dots in the product were all around my eyes
lines where there were none
made my dark circles more evident
which made wrinkles more apparent
this product has a significant drying effect
i only had minimal fine lines
has had zero effect on my dark circles
no noticable change yet
no change - at all - in dark circles.
considering dark circles was the main issue
noticed no difference in my dark circles
have not noticed any difference in my dark circles
however, when it dries, it make my creases worse.
there has been zero improvement:
haven't noticed any improvement so far in the circles or lines under my eyes
slight significant results to reduce dark circles
fine lines are still very visible
i've used the cream at least 2x a day with no visible sign of reduction to my dark circles
saw no improvement in my dark circles at all
i didn't notice any visible difference in the laugh lines around my eyes or dark circles either
i didn't notice any permanent difference in this making my dark eye circles disappear
no change in pigment
i do not see any reduction of dark circles or fatigue
i see no difference between this
except a huge difference in price
the dark circle is still very noticeable.
it caused me discomfort
i didn't notice any noticeable changes with my skins appearance
my skin tone appears brighter
the wrinkles had to go
there was no visible difference in lines
or general appearance under the eyes
it's not negligible either
literally noticed no change.
my under eye area is no exception
haven't noticed much of a difference
however, i didn't notice any lasting effects.
it did absolutely nothing for my dark under eye circles or help at concealing signs of fatigue or puffiness
i still suffer from the acne scars that this product caused till this day
i noticed that when i had heavy makeup on it would not remove it all
it's known to cause breathing problems to children
it caused a bad irritation precisely under my eyes
the left one had no actual wrinkle
it caused me to have massive breakouts
awful, at least for the pale girls out there.
the tint makes that apparent
am yet to see the brightening effect
wrinkles are the same
it's a shame that it had no perceivable effect on my skin
the cons: no brightening results
no change is discoloration
insane price for a product with no positive visual results
saw no change in my skin
i didn't see any noticeable results
kind of expected this to blow me away or at least create some kind of noticeable change in my skin
i didn't notice a significant difference with this
the area of hyper pigmentation around my eyes has lessened a bit
unfortunately this caused me small breakouts
no difference in dark spots
it causes my makeup to become noticeably splotchy
general brightening of the skin
the mask had quite an intense stinging feeling
i noticed no difference whatsoever
a sensation does not equate a physical result or difference
didn't notice any major radiance or brightness after regular use
i saw immediate results
the pores remained the same.
haven't seen any results
to the point where there was slight peeling
my face looks no different
however, i have visible pores.
there is no improvement on my skin
i didn't see any improvements when wearing this under makeup or at night in fact i noticed more breakouts than before
i believe its use caused several small pimples to flare up to monster sized craters
i saw many reviews for it helping with redness
my pores looked huge
was it made my face whiter than normal
looked in the mirror i noticed shimmer all over
it claims to be brightening
without seeing or feeling noticeable results
i took a pic under a lamp and it's evident .
still harsh for those with chronic redness even when mixed with an oil
my skin reacted negatively to it
i noticed a few white heads had appeared
on the positive side
i did not notice a significant difference in my skin
i've noticed that my pores got so small
i prefer genifique over this due to the smell
not a normal occurrence for me
i do see a difference in my acne scars
saw no difference whatsoever.
not a big change in my skin
however it caused bad breakouts
i no longer observed any further improvement in my skin
made my skin breakout.
which subsided after i discontinued use
my skin saw no benefit, only negatives.
i see now difference in my dark circles
i didnt noticed any change to under eye dark circles or wrinkles
i see a huge difference in my under eye area
this product was a slight disappointment
i got a major headache from the scent
leaves a slight film on your skin
no improvement seen in my skin.
i think that due to this heaviness
i wasn't expecting dramatic results.
haven't seen any results
dark circles have never been my concern
trouble areas would see vast improvement
it has definitely reduced the size of my pores
i see no difference whatsoever
same with the lines in my neck where i had actually noticed a difference
my scars never diminished
no positive changes - at all!
this product had no effect on my skin.
it also has an unusual smell
i saw no difference in my skin whatsoever.
it also started to change the texture of my skin
saw no improvement in my skin tone/texture/fine lines/etc
didn't see any changes regarding my pores or scars
i like at least some subtle results after 30 day continuous use
i did see an improvement
as far as complexion-brightening
i've noticed that my acne has increased more by using this product
it made my skin breakout
my hyperpigmentation problems are no better
sadly after every application i noticed my skin breakout
it did clear my skin of any acne
i just added some more on my cheek bone since i have sunspots there
the immediate smoothing effect on my skin's appearance
my breakouts have resurfaced
noticed how smooth my face looked
neck than similar products
the scent is so strong it gave me an immediate migraine
i didn't notice any "blurring" as it claims.
didn't caused any sensitivity
haven't noticed a huge difference
notice no difference on "bluring
with zero visible difference
saw no improvement in my skin
my pores look significantly smaller
is what has a slight affect
haven't noticed any real changes in my under eye area
no real wrinkles or dark circles
felt too heavy on my skin and caused breakouts.
so this was alarming
one positive is it hasn't broken me out
that was my main concern
the bumps have disappeared
i noticed that my skin had gotten bumpy
it is not firming whatsoever
i began seeing lines/creases under my eyes after one week
there were no signs of these lines
this cream actually made my under eye area look even worse than before- made my wrinkles more pronounced
it made my dark circles worse.
have not noticed any change in my dark circles or the elasticity of my lids
it made my dark circles even darker
this hasn't changed it
but as for this, i noticed no brighting.
none of them have faded
saw zero changes to my skin
have seen no ongoing difference in my eyes
i didn't notice any improvement in the appearance of crow's feet or crepey skin
my eye wrinkles actually looked worse
with no improvement in dark circles
no improvements are noticed
the only product i've ever returned due to sheer quality
it did decrease the look of wrinkles around the corners of my eyes
have not seen any improvement in crows feet/eye wrinkles
i did not see a reduction in lines or wrinkles.
the lines are just as visible as they were before this cream
my fine lines have not really diminished at all
my fine lines have not diminished at all
i did not notice any color-correcting properties.
the gold version did nothing for my redness.
i will definitely stick to the clinique dramatically different moisturizers
noticeable glitter on face.
i've noticed that i have started to get little white bumps all over my face
it really does give a "blurred" effect to pores.
gave it a blurred effect without being heavy
this definitely leaves a noticeable white cast
i feel like it has been improving my scars
had little bumps on my skin
the product left a noticeable white veil on my face
it also made my makeup look patchy throughout the day
left a rather noticeable white cast
couldn't get past the unpleasant tingling that happened with my skin immediately
this mask was gross in appearance
have not noticed anything different with my skin
realized the redness continued
didn't notice any significant change to my existing scars
is also didn't make any noticeable changes in my skin in the last 3 months of use
it has not improved texture
i did not notice any brightening or illuminating affects
i've not noticed any difference in my skin after using this product
have not seen any noticeable improvement in the texture or firmness of my skin
i did appreciate the light reflecting properties to it
i did not see any major improvements in my skin
this mask did make my face appear brighter
this seemed to make no difference
after one use i noticed that my skin was brighter
my pores were mostly clear
blemishes are still there
i see no difference
i didn't notice a huge difference in clearing my breakouts
so the surprise was unpleasant
i could see it changing my physical complexion2
this is more of subtle mask
have not noticed a difference
i didn't notice any immediate difference right away or at significant improvement over the course of my trial
i did not see any improvement in my skin's overall texture after several uses
no real noticeable difference.
i still had traces of eye makeup
this took the longest to soften
no visible difference in undereye circles or fine lines
worse than i've seen on my face in years
no difference in dark circles or fine lines.
i dont feel like it has made any significant differences
there has been zero improvement after use
definitely with creases under my eyes
if i would have seen the slightest improvement i would have repurchased
some people might like that tightness.
no noticeable results after 2 weeks
it also actually made my pores look more noticeable
this only exacerbated the problem
issue is it actually made my pores appear larger after repeated use
i don't notice a significant or any change done
it hasn't left my skin smoother or changed my tone
not certain if the fine lines are less pronounced
the appearance of my face is smoother
for the price i expected some drastic results
did not improve skin tone
i rarely get a blemish
only saw it brightened my complexion
what a difference it has made
but i see no brightening.
but this aggravated my time of the month acne.
definitely haven't noticed any brightening
it hasn't changed at all
this mask made no changes in my skin other than dryness
overall the product did brighten my skin.
had high expectations for the brightening
it just did not give me the noticeable results i'd hoped for
saw no change in my skin whatsoever
no wrinkles of any kind
didn't tighten skin or reduced any wrinkles at all
for me i didn't notice visible results.
it gives your skin a blurred angelical effect
the feeling would persist
for now it had absolutely no positive affect on my skin
it didn't provide any noticeable results over time
after application i don't notice much of a change in the pigment under my eye
i felt like it was causing some breakouts.
with further use the breakouts have gone down
i noticed some of more pores were getting clogged
the only positive is the price
there was little to no difference in the pimples
i saw so changes in the brightness of my skin
i honestly saw less redness in my face
however since purchasing it i noticed my pores on my nose are now clogged
made my eyesight very blurry
quickly realized it was the cause of my sudden breakouts
there isn't any difference with my eyes except the dark circles still appearing
it made my dark circles worse
i see no difference in my eyes.
no change in dark spots
no long term evening of skin tone
however this is great for lightening areas
i never saw any improvement in the pigment of my scarring
doesnt seem to improve scarring or pigmentation
i reacted quite badly to it--think redness
i see no difference in my under eye area.
i see no improvement
this eye treatment caused my under eye area to become red
saw no improvement whatsoever
i saw no difference.
i do not see any improvement in the light wrinkles around my eyes
saw no visible difference
found it only helpful with my under eye puffiness
he suggested pairing this with the radiance drops as he said my redness wasn't bad enough for the calming
i noticed no difference.
it has a noticeable greasy feeling
as you can see there was zero improvement in either bagginess
i'd say within the week i noticed a difference in my skin
i did notice my skin looked plumper after using this
hasn't caused any break outs
they were small areas of patchy
cause some minor breakouts
my makeup had issues
are influenced by the individual user: i cannot see the slightest improvement in the appearance of my wrinkles
gradually caused me to get little white bumps under my eyes
found no "miracles" after using this eye cream
i noticed zero difference
this made my skin sting a lot
haven't noticed any difference
my dry patches were still noticeable
it didn't brighten or make any change to the general appearance of my skin
definitely stings when applied over any blemished
left little bumps on certain parts of my skin
i felt this uncomfortable stinging
i woke up with a significant breakout on my forehead
i see no big difference because i have normal skin
i saw no lasting effects at all
haven't noticed any results either.
however does soften my face after a few hours
this has always been an important part of my night time facial regime
while my skin hasn't reacted negatively
saw no change nor improvements
have seen zero change
i didn't see any visible results
i've used it now daily for 3 weeks with no notable results
although it had the firming
it made my eyes look worse
my main concern for buying was for dark circles
continue using this i noticed it doing nothing on dark circles
however, i haven't noticed any differences yet.
i actually think "eye hope" by philosophy visibly reduced my fine lines
still have my dark circles, but less puffiness.
my face has been flawless for the past two months despite suffering from hormonal acne in the past
near my cheeks didn't look any less noticeable
with more redness than i started
it caused me to have breakouts on my face at places that never had any acnes before
it doesnt seem to make a dramatic difference
curious about the other two masks.
offer no visible benefits
the only reason i'm not giving this 5 stars is the calming white
my initial reaction is that it can be a little drying on the skin
immediately saw reduction of fine lines
i realized i have some very minor crowfeet
didn't notice any improvement to dark circles
the eye cream has shimmer in it although it's only visible upon closer inspection
however is the only ingredient that "visibly brightens the eye area"
i didn't see any change in redness
don't see much of a change in the redness caused by irritation on my cheeks
does nothing for any redness
i didn't see a big difference in my redness since i started using it
it actually appeared to enhance the redness around my cheeks
no noticeable redness relief benefit
it says it decreases redness
makes no noticeable difference both after application
no noticeable reduction in redness after 3 weeks of use
i do notice a slight difference in reducing redness
this made no difference in my skin
i noticed a little change in the redness
there is no difference in any of the areas mentioned by others
if you already have spider veins or just minimal
my veins even more visible
in places i've never noticed before
no real major problem
no noticeable difference in fine lines or hydration
saw no difference in crows feet or skin tone
i don't have really dark circles or pronounced puffiness to begin with
found no problems with it
i don't notice any significant improvement in my skin however with regard to fine lines
this had the opposite affect
have not seen any difference
made dry patches more noticeable
i also noticed a lot more small pimples
it also caused bad acne so i'm returning
after using for 2 weeks my skin looked worse.
i did not see any major difference in moisture level
liked the initial texture
i also noticed that my bite lipsticks staying power was slightly increased
wrinkles were more noticeable
flaky makeup are two major no-nos for me
i also think this serum is the reason for my recent break outs
if i don't see significant change
it does have a noticeable rose scent.
the acne that i had began to clear
i've noticed a more even tone
i did notice a slight reduction in redness in y cheeks
the amount of inconsistency between the two was crazy
this only had negative effects
my skin hasn't changed
no improvement in signs of aging.
not a huge turnoff of for me
i didn't react to it or have any adverse effects
i also didn't have any noticeable results
did nothing to fade scars or dark spots or brighten my skin tone
also have seen no results
i didn't notice any drastic changes
was hoping to notice skin improvement
i saw no improvements in my skin
this seems to be good at softening my skin
slightly uneven skin tone
which takes a long time to begin seeing positive results
no noticeable difference after using a whole bottle
haven't noticed a difference in the bags under my eyes
haven't noticed any improvements when it comes to fine lines
slightly wrinkles under my eye
definitely not for decreasing
though from finishing one jar i have yet to notice any noticeable difference from other eye creams i've used in the past
i could feel the tightness in the skin around my eyes
i also like that one of the ingredients has been shown to reduce dark circles
have had no changes to unevenness
i noticed that i was getting some majorly clogged pores
it also was causing redness
i usually have a blemish or two
i pushed past the awful odor
my skin had gotten darker
i realized that my skin color had indeed changed
unfortunately i also noticed several whiteheads
my skin has been clear since accutane
it made my face darker
this really changed my face color to a different shade
i am noticeably darker on the area i applied
or making any noticeable difference in my skin
did not see any positive effect on my skin.
no real improvements in skin
different (in a positive way) texture!
hydrates- i noticed an immediate difference
something in it caused a minor breakout
there are plenty of masks out there that make a dramatic difference in my skin
saw no difference in my skin after using this product
is overall unsatisfactory to use
i saw a slight difference around my eyes with this product
i see no difference
i really haven't seen much improvement in my eye area
hope that by then there will be noticeable improvements
i feel like my fine lines are more noticeable
dark circles are still visible
it made my skin texture worse
saw no improvement at all
now that i've gotten the acne under control
the past acne marks are still there
some darker spots from previous sun damage have started to appear
so many people commented that this faded their freckles
have not noticed any one of my spots or marks any lighter
this made my skin darker
it made my neck a little darker
there has been zero effect.
it has not helped with reducing the visibility of my acne scars
only a couple of slight places that have hyperpigmentation
i've noticed my skin is brighter
it hasn't helped with reducing the visibility of my acne scars
it might have had the slightest difference in my skin
it hasn't brought about any dramatic changes to brighten/lighten up my darks spots
there was undoubtably a reduction in my hyperpigmentation from acne scars after using this once or twice a day
the product made my spots darker
i never noticed any change at all.
since it says "rapid" "lightening" you'd think i would notice something
no lightening whatsoever, no change at all.
not the scars so my scars are even more prominent now
def not for deeper discoloration
i did not notice any changes in overall skin tone
i ordered this product in the hopes it would diminish the appearance
it only exacerbated the problem
has now caused dark spots to appear on my cheeks
still no difference in my skin
lightened my spots slightly
the one acne scar i was trying to fade is no less prominent than before
although i had no intent to fade away my light freckles
they are still visible
only noticed a very slight
almost unnoticeable difference on my sun spots
i don't think my acne scar is any noticeably lighter than before
perhaps even the darkening of my spots
there is nothing rapid about this
he promised quick noticeable results by the time i used 1/2
no difference was made.
haven't noticed any chance or improvement
have seen some minor change on a major dark spot
this product did indeed drastically improve my hyperpigmentation from a bad breakout several months ago
i've noticed some lightening for the darkest of my acne scars already
will continue to use to see if it helps with the hyper-pigmentation from the previous acne scars i got during that time
in fact it created this dark pigmentation around my mouth i've never had this happen before
brought on more acne flareups
have not seen any difference in spots or fine lines
had little red dots all over
it caused more acne
in the morning my acne seemed to have been calmer
his skin cleared up dramatically
that resulted in more breakouts
it is definitely the cleanser causing the problems
i saw zero difference in my skin as a result of using this
in an unusual spot
i don't see any difference in lifting or firming.
my fine lines are diminished
it wasn't noticeable to anyone except me
that's the only positive thing
hasn't softened up since
