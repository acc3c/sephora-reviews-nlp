i don't really notice any changes.
no matter what i did i experienced a ton of pilling

i didn't notice my skin feeling much different
not even obvious dead skin
i personally didn't notice any firming or tightening in my skin
that's the only benefit that i experienced
didn't see any changes on my skin
was surprised how my skin reacted
doesn't have any adverse effects on my skin
it doesn't have any long term impact
somehow after this mask i experienced what appeared to be a minor couple blemishes appear
i don't notice a big enough difference in my skin after using it for the price
i think the brightening orange one is definitely worth it though
i did notice that it did make my skin feel a little smoother
plus is changes color
this didn't have any impact on my skin
i didn't notice a large amount of difference.
it had no affect on the texture of my skin.
no reduction in the appearance of pores
i don't notice any visible difference with my skin texture
haven't noticed any benefits
there was no reduction in redness which was my reason for purchase
has the same effect
i just didn't noticed a huge difference
also didn't notice any difference in my skin
i didn't notice that much of a difference.
have not seen a difference in fine lines or firmness
i didn't notice any difference
this serum for some reason caused it to get worse
it seems to make no difference
after the initial application i noticed how greasy my face felt
i didn't notice any difference in the hydration level of my skin
this was the only skincare change i made at that time
did not deliver any discernible benefits
haven't noticed any difference in the surface of my face
this made no difference in my fine lines
i can't say i noticed any difference in my skin while using it
this product makes no difference on my skin
i did not notice any change after using it for 2 weeks
i don't see any noticeable difference
haven't noticed any difference
though i haven't noticed any reduction in aging
i can't say that i have noticed any change in my skin
on the positive side
have not noticed a difference in my skin texture or a in wrinkles
more importantly i also have not noticed any improvement either
i didn't noticed any change
it did have a very slight cooling feeling after it was applied
the product did not make much difference in brightening my p
it really made no difference for me at all.
i honestly notice no more of a difference then when i use my normal moisturizer over my whole face for the area
i don't see any changes or brightening under my eyes
but i didn't notice much of a difference.
really didn't notice any difference with my eyes after this
no significant change over a longer time period
it literally made no difference
haven't been dealing with much fine lines
haven't noticed any changes in my eye area
i see no visible effects
there is no real pep in my eyes
used the whole deluxe tube and saw no difference.
i really noticed no change with it
have noticed some brightening
i didn't see any improvement with my dark circles
i did not see any visible repairing effects
i can't say i saw a huge difference in terms of puffiness
i could see no difference in the before
wasn't expecting any adverse effects
i notice no real results, though i wanted to.
the only thing experienced in store
there was not much of a difference i saw.
actually there is no change around my eye area
been using for a month and i see no difference .
nothing beneficial has happened
have not noticed much change at all
after trying it for a week i noticed no difference at all
i saw no change
the effect of any line diminishment can be had by any decent primer
got it as a sample but even that i regretted.
was surprised to see many women said it made their skin worse
they are only very noticeable when i smile
make the line appear worse
noticed a slight softening of lines
have seen no improvement of any kind
i saw no improvement
i saw a review for this concerning lip lines.
i do think it has improved the very fine lines in my cheeks
see no effect whatsoever
unfortunately after 1 week of daily use i have noticed 0 improvement
there would be something slight
the effect is noticeable
this just magnified all the issues i'm uncomfortable with
actually made my minor lines look worse
i noticed a slight improvement with my under eye bags
the only downfall is that it irritated my skin a bit
noticed not the slightest improvement after 4 days
i realize it takes much longer for a product to show significant improvement
after a week i saw no difference
this product did not change the appearance of my fine lines or wrinkles
haven't seen any results
i've never had this problem before
i do see some aging differences in my skin
in 3 weeks it didn't do anything as far as diminishing wrinkles at all
have seen no difference
this actually emphasized my lines!
didn't notice any changes
my under eye lines havent even slightly diminished :-
honestly i have seen no visible changes.
cons-no noticeable effects.
haven't noticed any "resurfacing" effect
used it for a weeks w/out any noticeable difference to my skin
his skin is different than mine, however.
in the end results were lacking
i didn't notice any difference when i stopped using it
have not noticed anything different in my skin
however it made my face
i didn't notice any real positive effects from the product
after seeing the praises from people with similar skin
no real difference in skin appearance
the mask is life changing.
disappointed because the associates at sephora said it will give me miraculous results in shrinking my pores
actually created a wrinkle next morning
that are barely noticeable to most people
i also had an additional wrinkle i never had before
i feel like i had the signs of progress early on
the patches although in need of improvement
which just further stressed my problem area
i could see differences day by day.
i don't see any difference in the fine lines around my eyes
haven't seen any changes at all
i really saw no change in my wrinkles.
i saw no change
the first time i thought it was because i used it over retinal
i also didn't notice a glow or diminish of fine lines which is what sold me with this product
for some reason it made my skin really patchy too
it gets significantly worse
i stopped using this and my skin is improving.
now that the weather has changed my skin has gone dryer
something strange was happening after i applied it on my face
i never noticed a difference in my skin.
did not seen an improvement.
i saw no benefits
there are much better physical exfoliators than this
it has a little warming action
really haven't noticed much of a difference in the texture of my face
not sure yet of the change in texture
its a bit less than spectacular
i don't see any improvement in my pores
i didn't find any visible result
notice no difference in my skin
sadly this mask delivered none of that
the fact that is stung
however over time there was no change
but i saw very little change in my pores.
second: i did not notice a considerable difference in reduction of pore size or refined skin texture
i noticed i had an increase in clogged pores
do difference after applying
i really didn't notice any change in fine lines.
haven't noticed any brightening
have not seen any evid nc of reduction of fine lines in 2 weeks of use
i noticed absolutely nothing when using this product
although i'm fortunate not to have any significant signs of aging yet
since i'm absolutely terrified of showing signs of aging there
the results was minimal.
i don't really notice a difference in my skin except it caused blemishes to r
i saw no difference in skin.
although i did notice less visible lines
this didn't do anything for brightening my scars like some claim
this has never happened
have no qualms spending on good products
which might be an improvement
the first couple of days i had no issue -- just a slight tingling sensation
not only did it have zero cooling effect
it had no cooling effect.
perhaps this is due to the change in formula
i think it caused my skin to breakout just a bit.
i always notice a new blemish that wasn't even coming on before application
my skin has gotten better since
i didn't see any difference in the effect of any facial when i used this primer
it just doesn't perform to any noticeable degree
i see no benefit
it still had the opposite effect
i don't see a huge difference in the results
i see no difference in the face masks.
noticed no difference in mask performance
i noticed no difference when using this product
it had no effect whatsoever on the performance of the two masks i've tried it with
did notice slight difference when applying the mask
didn't notice any difference from other masks i've used
though i haven't really noticed any difference with my masks
t might have a similar effect
after using it a few times i saw no improvements in the quality of the mask other than it helped make application smoother
the benefits of the mask isn't noticeable
i don't see any noticable improvements
i kind of just feel like i haven't noticed any difference in my skin like at all while using this
the most horrible product that has ever touch my face
as i started using it i noticed that i was starting to breakout which is odd because my face doesn't otfen breakout
the only thing that changed in my routine was this product
i also never felt like my t-zone benefited much from the product
my complexion just isn't responding to it
all of a sudden i started having the worst allergic reactions throughout the day
when i heard about the benefits that including a facial oil to my oily
i did notice my skin a little softer the next day
otherwise this had no brightening effects.
the fragrance that lingered forever was actually worse that that
it did nothing to brighten my complexion in any way whatsoever
changing form of birth control gave me a bit of acne that i've have not dealt with previously
could see if i noticed a difference
unfortunately i saw no difference at all.
made my fine lines worse
made my fine under eye lines more noticeable
it made no major change to my skin
better in my opinion
it made it worse
i saw no difference
disappointing overall, to say the least.
there is no difference whatsoever.
there is no evidence of it in my pictures
did not notice any dramatic difference in the firmness or minimizing the appearance of my pores
the pamphlet inside didn't make it any clearer
night i have now seen a reduction in lines or pores
noticed zero difference in my ender eye area :
there was not difference
she didnt see a difference either
but unfortunately i haven't seen a difference.
i didn't experience any visible brightening or depuffing effects
see no difference at all
i don't notice the cooling effect i read about.
i see an improvement in my dark circles
i saw that it started to decrease
i would really love to have a cooling effect around my eyes since that feels refreshing
i really haven't noticed an improvement in hydration after about a week of use
i don't really seem to notice a huge difference in the few weeks i've used this
i don't see any major changes with my dark circles or puffiness
haven't noticed any results
they haven't really improved
as far as improving anything
didn't notice any difference in fine lines or dark circles
haven't seen any results
i notice no amazing effects.
i also don't really notice any difference between using this mask
no firming, no hydration no nothing.
no difference in "radiance" or anything
i saw no difference in my skin whatsoever.
so far this product hasn't done anything special to my face like others have mentioned- it improved my slight forehead wrinkles a little
that is the only positive i'm experiencing
they haven't gotten any worse
my skin did have some of the issues reported by other reviewers
at first i was alarmed
my skin felt no different than it did before
i definitely see no brightening or revitalization in the morning
had definitely dampened the use experience
had no noticeable results
people had actually commented that there was glitter on my face
it made no difference on my skin when i tried to highlight
the overall product has a nice balance between sheer
this product changed my mind
have not been able to tell a drastic difference
i like to apply it to my cheeks for an extra highlighting effect
i felt like it made it 10x's worse
didn't notice any lift or firm effect.
i didn't notice any difference in the lifting or improvement of my skin
it hasn't hurt it
my biggest issue with this though
this cream changed that!
this one i was indifferent about
it didn't have any long-term effect on my skin
as if there was a barrier
i noticed in the morning it would flake off because it interacted with the other products are used
had no blurring effect
i did not notice a single difference
unless i notice a huge difference in my skin without it
significantly reduce the appearance of fine lines
however i didn't see a very large difference
does virtually nothing for my skin
didn't notice one difference in my skin
i noticed no change in my skin
i saw absolutely no difference in my skin even after i used up the whole bottle
still saw none of the claims
very disappointed also raised some questions
this also hasn't helped with my problem skin.
i didn't notice a difference with my skin
just started this so far not noticing much difference
after two uses i've noticed this awful
very disappointed in the change
this one had the opposite effect
this was not a mask.
this product showed me no signs of eye firming or removal of dark circles
this made my eyes look worse than before
this instantly made it look worse
i see no changes.
there is no observable benefit to using this
at first i thought i was noticing some brighter looking skin
have been hesitant ever since
at first i thought it made my skin better
then i did not see any further improvement
i saw no difference in my skin
it was just an extra step in my skin care with no discernible results
it will show obvious improvement
haven't noticed any significant changes in my skin
within that time frame i didn't see any changes in my skin
as others have reported
the serum itself didn't seem to make any noticeable changes to my skin
i expected this serum to have some kind of effect on my skin
can see no marked difference in my skin
haven't gotten any better
since it wasn't showing any difference in my skin
didn't see any difference in my skin
as for the effect, i didn't notice any change.
nothing works overnight-nothing.
no change in texture
i didn't see the "brightening" benefits
that stuff is probably only visible under a special light
there was a period where i was in tears looking at my face without makeup because it caused so many problems for my skin
i also did not notice that it helped clear or prevent breakouts
i didn't notice any difference
overall very disappointed with the eye cream
in that sense, the eye cream met my expectations.
my skin had a terrible reaction to it
it maintained my skin
i did not notice brighter skin at all.
but the brightening claim didnt work for me.
i saw little to no difference in brightness with this cream
worse than its ever looked skin
i've seriously seen no results
there are a lot of positive reviews
so on got noticeable clogged
did not see any noticeable improvement in my skin
my biggest issue though is the fragance
its not that obvious
i saw improvement with my breakouts
the only thing i noticed was that it made my skin feel gross
starting to see the signs of aging
i did not see much of an improvement in my skin.
didn't notice any changes with fine lines
in fact my breakouts increased
very upset they changed a great product!
i gave it a good length of time to have some sort of effect on my skin
i didn't notice a huge difference
i've finished the whole bottle to see if there was any difference
have noticed no difference in my skin texture
used the entire bottle and saw no difference.
i did notice some of the fine lines around my eyes reduced
to be honest i haven't seen any difference in dark circles or fine lines
i did not see any results or any improvement.
didn't notice a difference in my skin
everybody's been complaining about that
i really didn't notice any difference between this
i noticed zero difference using this
have not noticed any changes
have not noticed a difference
not really seeing a difference yet
i don't notice much difference in terms of dark circles or puffiness
what i did notice was flakiness
t can have a greater effect
i can see little actual improvement
perhaps a slight cooling effect on contact
since it had no effect at the base use
i didn't notice a big difference
still didn't notice any difference
i saw no glow whatsoever.
night with no change what so ever
just to see some improvement
saw no visible reduction at all in my sun spots
have not seen any significant changes
i see zero difference before
experienced zero effect of change on my face after using the product
i returned the product since i had not experienced any good effects out of this
truthfully haven't seen a big difference in tone or fine lines
have seen a difference in smoothness when i wake up
it does seem to have a "firming" effect
did make my pores to be a little less apparent
i didn't notice any plumping or firming effects from this product
the result seems the same
i did notice an improvement of the longevity of my makeup
it just accentuated every little flaw
any slight texture was highlighted
overall i have not notice any elasticity/firmness improvement
though this product certainly has a firming effect
may even have a slight plumping effect
see if those effects become visible
i saw no plumping affect
did not notice any difference
there was no difference
this made no difference in the amount of oil my skin produced
i saw absolutely no change in the appearance of my face after using this product
mixed with foundation made no difference
at best, it made no difference.
i didn't notice a difference while using it
i don't notice a difference on my skin
there was absolutely no difference
it made no difference to me
i noticed no difference.
there was no noticeable difference
didn't notice any difference whatsoever especially in brightness
saw no difference in the tightening of skin.
not just a little, but noticeably so.
not only did i notice my fine lines growing in the first week
it made them significantly noticeable in 3 weeks
however i didn't see any benefit for depuffing the eye area or any brightening as it claims
noticed no improvement in the dark circles or wrinkles
i didn't see any changes under my eyes
i saw no difference after using this product
i noticed that my fine lines became more prominent
his lines look less noticeable
had better results for overall complexion
i like the consistency though.
no doubts about that.
hasn't had a problem with it at all
i didn't notice significant difference
continued to look worse with continued use
also haven't noticed any outst
the serum does nothing to improve the situation.
their clarifying mask is much better.
caused me to have a bad breakout
i mean no visible difference at all
have noticed that the nude color was sold out time
my skin had a breakout reaction to some ingredient
did not notice a difference.
it made no difference either
didn't notice any difference in my face from before
haven't noticed much added "glow"
this product was no exception.
after using this consistently it produced no visible results
can't say much for improvement on elasticity
i don't notice an overall huge improvement
haven't noticed any changes in my skin
overexfoliating is one of the biggest skin care mistakes people make
i did not notice much in the "brightening" of my skin though
did not notice any difference in the brightness of my skin
i didn't notice any blurring effect.
i didn't see any blurring effect
i don't notice any type of blurring effect.
noticed getting significantly oiler than i do with my regular products
it does not blur whatsoever.
would have liked blurred
this hasn't caused any drama with my skin so far
most startling for me was that it also gave me quite large pimples
yet it did not have that smoothing blurring effect that makes those downfalls sometimes worth it for a great makeup day
it doesn't have any immediate special effect
there was no product inside
i really only saw a few of the results
i didn't notice any blurring
there is no improvement to my pore size or skin tone
which had been a slight problem
the wow effect was not the same
while it does give you soft skin the result is not as noticeable as the mask
my skin is not prone to such reactions so this was really surprising
the main problem i have with it is the really strong fragrance
couldn't see an improvement in my skin
the breakouts were just getting worse
i should have returned it the minute i sensed its inefficiency
i can see a difference in the longevity of my makeup
no real difference noticed in my skin.
this is the only thing i changed in my routine
i did not notice any significant changes in the appearance of my skin
i also did not notice my skin feeling any firmer.
i just feel for $65 i should have seen improvements in my skin
i noticed no change in pore size nor did i notice my makeup lasting longer
i saw a difference underneath my foundation.
my oil appeared to be controlled a little better
before i put on my makeup i definitely saw that my pores were blurred or at least less noticeable
have noticed an increase in oiliness
this is the only thing that has changed in my routine
that appearance only got worse.
i don't notice much difference.
still have yet to see a difference
i saw no benefits
this product was a big disappointment.
no noticeable improvements in my skin.
needed something to refresh dull looking skin during the change of season
we heard it was good for brightening
it only made my skin worse
never noticed any change after use
in effect does nothing
this is supposed to be an improvement over the original miracle worker eye
but after using this, they have improved greatly!
this is the first eye cream i have used that have showed visible results
haven't noticed a difference with my dark circles though
i didn't see any major changes to my skin
haven't really seen much improvement yet
've been really into skincare lately
haven't had breakout probs in years until today
then i noticed pimples where there have never been any
there is no product up there
then there was the consistency
this made me worse
i saw some nice results.
though haven't noticed anything different
i hardly use it because i haven't noticed a difference with using it
i also didn't notice much of a mattifying effect.
my skin had been clear for quite some time
they did not decrease in severity or frequency
it is not a life altering experience .
love the initial feeling though
i've seen so many positive reviews about it
after a week of using it i noticed that my breakouts became worse
noticed there was a new pimple exactly the same kind right next to the other one
while i do believe i've seen an improvement in my skin's texture
especially since my skin had been acting up
my breakouts have actually gotten worse
i did not notice any increase in brightness/vibrancy after 4 uses
i really haven't seen any significant difference in my skin when i use it
some times i feel like i wake up with a few subtle blemishes the morning after i use this
it seemed like my skin might have been a little brighter
i didn't notice a difference in my skin after using it a couple times
haven't noticed any brightening effect on my skin
i didn't see any noticeable brightening effects
that's about all i've noticed as far as results
which is why i was surprised that my skin looked red
after a few weeks of trying it there are no visible improvements at all
didn't really notice any improvements.
i don't notice much of a difference in my skin
it doesn't really make a noticeable difference
can't say i noticed a difference in the brightness of my skin after one use
perhaps would notice a difference after consistent use
did notice my skin was a lot softer
see if i notice any difference
cannot say i noticed any difference in my skin!
no change in my skin
i found the mask did absolutely nothing for my skin in terms of texture or appearance
i saw no difference in skin clarity or brightness
this became a deal breaker when there were no noticeable effects to using it
i did think it was firming.
just need some firming
did not see any significant improvement on my skin
as for any illumination it wasn't detected at all
i didn't see any immediate results from the mask
after repeated use i have still seen no results.
i noticed the first time
i didn't see any difference in my skin besides it feeling softer
was disappointed to find that the consistency of it has changed
didn't notice any huge difference
i didn't notice any differences when i used this mask
it did not noticeably change the appearance of my face
because my skin has been so dull lately
hasn't helped my fine lines
may have brightened it a bit
it has not made a difference in my skin
my foundations look horrible now because of the recent decline in my skin texture
didn't notice any positive results
nothing has really changed for me
haven't had any amazing results
have seenno improvements with my skin
this made my skin worse!!
unfortunately this mask had a completely negative impact on my skin
the slight warming effect was very brief
i saw no difference in the texture of my skin either
i notice no difference at all
however every time after i used it i noticed little bumps under my skin
doesn't have any lasting effects
i also thought my skin might have even looked brighter
after i washed it off i did not notice a huge difference
i found the warming effect pleasant
i didn't notice much change in texture or softness
there's been no more improvement
in the morning the blemish looks exactly the same
the effect wasn't long lasting
see if i notice a difference
i didn't notice that my skin felt any different in terms of smoothness or moisture retention
perhaps the sample wasn't enough to effect a difference
two stars because it has no negative effects
i see no difference in my skin
and no bad reactions either.
after the residue it left felt similar to the texture of vasilne
do some major damage to my sensitive skin
however the skin firming/tightening i did not feel at all
neother time did i notice any results
i did not notice any visible changes
my normal skin felt the same before
have not seen any results
i did not even see a slight change in my skin
i do not see any real visible differences
this was a huge disappointment
i honestly didn't notice any changes in my skin
have seen no improvements in my skin
i saw little to no results
honestly i have not noticed any huge differences in my skin
this is the only thing in my routine that has changed
only drawback was i had to keep applying it.
i didn't see any brightening effect with this cream
i applied yet another layer to alleviate some more of the tightness that remained
noticed nothing changed with my skin
however i saw no anti aging benefits
i also did not notice anything beneficial besides the light moisture
the only notable pro was it did not irritate my sensitive skin
a big no no to this.
no changes to the appearance of my skin
the only difference i've noticed is my skins seems more dry
i noticed no difference in my skin.
compared to other products they've used this was a bit too much like 'make-up' rather than a redness reducing cream
f you have a lighter complexion i would not suggest this product
i saw another review about how it also happened to another pale person
i gave it the benefit of the doubt
t draws attention to what i'm trying to color correct in the first place
it was too noticeable on my skin
i also noticed that it has mineral oil in it.
i didn't notice much of a different in my pores also
however did nothing for pore coverage
there's no in-between.
have not noticed any change.
without it it makes no difference
i also noticed that this did not really reduce my pores or fine lines
i didn't see a difference in the length or deep of my fine lines
never noticed a difference under my eyes
have seen no improvement
no improvement in my lines or under eye bags
no visible results for me
no improvement at all.
my major concern is under eye bags
it removed hardly anything
honestly i see no improvement
saw no improvement in anything!!
having not altered my skincare routine outside of this product
i saw no results.
i even took before pictures each week to see if there was an improvement in my dark circles
there was no difference at all.
this was a big disappointment though.
regarding the fine lines i was not expecting amazing results from the sample alone
no matter how much i smoothed out the cream
i didn't notice any improvement to my undereyes either
i see no results
did i notice it "instantly brightened" or "reduced the appearance of dark circles"
i noticed nothing "magical" with this cream despite the claims
reading reviews i was hopeful to see a difference with fine lines
after 3 weeks of use i really don't see much improvement
made my fine lines more visible
i've never had any issue with any eye cream
i didn't notice even the tiniest difference
i don't see drastic changes
made it look worse
since it did nothing eventually my skin condition got worse
got the same result
have not seen any visible difference in repair
after continued use i noticed my skin getting irritated
this only helped slightly
i saw no benefit
does not significantly improve the condition of my blemish prone
i do not see the huge improvement in my skin i see with the dr
it wasn't doing anything to improve the claims it made such as redness
which is a big disappointment
there is the tiniest amount of difference.
only making things worse
this may partly be due to the fact that i already have an oily complexion
still didn't see any noticeable color correctness
you could see how there was a slight green tint to it
he had the same problem
didn't make enough difference in the redness to justify spending that much
i still had a lot more residue left.
i used it before i noticed
on a more positive note
my skin definitely has improved a bit with this cream: i haven't had the dreaded winter "flakes"
my main concern was lifting
unfortunately after 2 months i really haven't seen much of a difference
no lifting is greatly seen
it hasn't given me any breakouts at all
i certainly haven't noticed any "contouring" effect
i hoped to like this cream after reading positive reviews
the next day i had the most severe acne breakout i've ever had in my life
the only thing that changed in my routine
it has the consistency
more visible than ever
noticed a difference in the texture of my skin
but i see no sign of brightening or firming.
did not see any difference in my hyper pigmentation
haven't found it yet
the only different i saw was more fine lines
especially since i was barely wearing any make up
smoother or improved in any way
however i have not noticed a decrease in oil production in fact mine has worsen
consistency that this was not oil
however, i was a little disappointed.
it was no better in fact it seemed worse.
although this is a "sensitive" skin product i felt that it disrupted my skin
i did not notice a problem with the oil though.
i wish there was more of a brightening quality to this product
including this product was the only change i've made
it has been really effective in fading any dark marks i may have
seeing the other reviews confirmed that is
the next day i saw no changes in my skin.
i didn't really notice a huge difference for my skin
i do not notice any change to my eye area
i didn't notice any results as far as my fine lines or dark circles were concerned
no changes with fine line or wrinkles
a huge no no for me.
was there maybe a sparkle here or there?
waiting for the right lighting to make their presence known
i think a lot of people who have left more positive reviews haven't seen this in the full scope of lightings
it is not subtle in any way.
definitely not the first time tarte has been a huge disappointment
did highlight my skin
i even did a comparison of one eye with it
there were no differences
this product definitely is noticeable
as to the actual product i saw no change
i don't notice a different with reduced wrinkle
i didn't notice much of a difference with reducing puffiness or dark circles
i feel like it didn't make a big difference on the brightening side
didn't notice a huge difference
this one claims "instant properties" however nothing was instantly changed on me
the sample was too small to even see a difference
which was a huge plus in my opinion
i actually experienced a bit of burning
didn't do much by why of smoothing/blurring
i also didn't think the color matched me well.
not the other there is definitely a big difference
i personally saw no difference after using the product
i saw little to no difference in the skin underneath the eye area
i did not see any difference in puffiness or dark circles
i didn't notice a single change or difference
it didnt see much difference
according to the description it said that after 4 weeks people saw differences
have not noticed a difference in the month that i've been using the sample
didn't really notice a difference.
haven't noticed any firming
i don't see a difference in skin tone
i did not notice any difference to my the skin on my neck with with daily
there has been no firming at all
in fact my skin looks worse.
i started to notice dry patches which i never had
have not noticed an improvement
this product didn't change the appearance of them at all
my skin was much happier when i stopped using this
have not seen a difference
not even a slight improvement.
i would need to see dramatic results
unfortunately after two weeks of use i saw not even minor improvements in the very faint lines on my forehead
i've recently started to notice some fine lines here
saw no results that weren't temporary
it also had a sticky consistency
after 7 days i saw no difference in my skin
i don't notice any improvements on my skin neither
its not because my skin has gotten worse or anything
it was absorbed by my skin in no time
but had the formula changed??
nothing changed in my skin care routine
my face was worse in terms of oiliness than usual
it left a pretty significant film on my skin
first impression, zero impressed.
i don't notice a $150 change in my skin.
i didn't notice a difference when putting this on
considering the minimal results i saw
i didn't notice any difference in my skin either aside from all the gold glitter
it actually made my skin look worse
there's no difference in my skin
i explained to her that my skin was changing i assumed due to aging
foundation made it more apparent
i've only ever had a reaction to one product
t was simply devastating
that's about where the positive reviews end
it is obvious that it has some kind of dark color
it did not provide a mattifying look or effect that lasted longer than blotting papers
i get the same mattified effect when i blot my face
honestly nothing positive about this mask.
shows no signs of replenishing your skin
there is no visible sign of a reaction or irritation
however, i don't notice any other improvements.
i didnt really see any improvement in fine lines or texture
this product definitely exacerbated it
never had problems like this with skin products before
after using it several times i saw no visible results
as in no reduction of fine lines or diminishing of pores
then twice a week when i noticed no change
it doesn't really detract from my opinion of the product overall
my skin had never looked better
marula oil i have seen a great improvement in my cheeks
the reason that i am not enamored with it is that there was not really a noticable effect for me
i also experienced a slight breakout around my chin
after a week of use i haven't noticed any difference in my skin
still the same result
i saw absolutely no difference in my skin
i didn't notice any difference between this
however it didn't impact my skin positively or negatively
i didn't notice any change to my skin in terms of brightness
it was much heavier than i anticipated
gave this product 2 weeks to show improvement on my skin
it looked healthier than usual
the first thing i noticed was how heavy it was
i didn't notice a difference in my skin
get good results without the irritation
this one was has had no noticeable effect whatsoever
this was quite the disappointment!
i don't see any major difference to my skin
this is a serious miss
wasn't expecting the consistency to be so thick.
sadly i did not notice a difference in my skin after use
i've started to notice that the cleanser is deteriorating the black cap
didn't notice any improvements
still no change in the dark circles
after using it two years i noticed no real difference on my skin
on top of that it worsened breakouts.
the effect was stunning the next morning that my skin is much smoother
this cream was a disappointment
there were no noticeable changes
have noticed absolutely no difference in my dark circles
no noticeable difference after using for about six months no difference in dark circles or in wrinkles
i saw a very slight improvement in my little smile lines
have seen no improvements
i wasn't expecting anything drastic
accentuated every bump i had
there's no noticeable difference in the way my makeup sets
i didn't notice much difference when it came to skin texture
i barely noticed a difference in the appearance of my skin
i personally found that the blurring is more noticeable in photos than irl
while i like the blurring effect
i also noticed that it did make my pores look smaller
i saw very little if any improvement of my chronic dark circles
didn't cause any negative outcomes
the actual product is in a little chamber that is about 1/4 of the bottle shown in the picture
haven't noticed a marked difference in puffiness
i switched to a different eye cream to see if that made a difference
immediately saw a slight darkening
i noticed a slight improvement in my dark circles
or diminish any fine lines
i did not notice any dramatic or significant changes under my eyes though
i see absolutely zero difference on my skin around my eyes
due to the higher price i was expecting to notice an improvement
i definitely would have paid the high price for this cream if i had seen a difference in my under eye problem
however i haven't seen a difference in the hydration in the skin around my eyes
after using for a while i haven't noticed a change in my oily skin
my skin has been the same maybe worse.
the oily characteristic has been the same for me
i've noticed more breakouts than before when i was using pores no more
nor really decreasing my breakouts at a faster rate
i would probably end up returning this since i'm unsatisfied with the overall result
sheer transformation for the past 4 years without any problems
especially in the warmer months to come
didn't notice dramatic results
i assume by day 7 i will notice a difference
i didn't notice any difference at all.
i did notice that one of my fine lines looked less visible with this cream on
there is no improvement
i've seen little improvement regarding any lines or circles
i found building it up made it look a little uneven
the results were terrible
it did reduce the depth of those under my eyes
i didn't see any improvements
didn't notice any change in my skin.
fortunately i haven't had any skin reactions
haven't seen any improvements
can tell a slight reduction in fine lines
still didnt see any improvement to my skin
a definite return for me.
no matter how much i was rubbing
nothing has impressed me or improved my skin
little bumps started showing up where they previously weren't
applied foundation on i don't see a difference
i saw no difference in my skin nor makeup application
i didn't notice much difference after makeup
i gives me serious breakoutsi had some problems with my skin after using a face cream
:( nothing changed in my routine.
even noticed some irritation with it
i think it made my makeup look worse as it decreased its wear time
there is no difference short term or long term
it didn't improve my skin's appearance in any way
had the biggest pimples i've ever had in my life
i found it to have no skin benefits
my skin condition has been getting worse
my skin was never in uglier shape
didn't notice any results
when they changed the spf to 40
zero complaints, my skin was flawless.
which seemingly shows only to change the spf
you can imagine my shock when i discovered that they had changed the formula
the lady at sephora made it seem like it wouldn't be a very noticeable difference after one use
while the product did work fine as overall primer i did not see any pore blurring or vanishing as promised in the product description
my pores showed as much as ever.
slightly different than the previous product
this time it was disappointment
it hasn't changed yet
saw literally no difference
make it softer than anything i have ever experienced
so far the results have been positive with it reducing the redness
i noticed no differences when i used this mask.
really didn't notice much of an improvement at all
saw how small the product was
have not noticed any difference at all
it made my skin breakout
this went on thicker than i would have liked
after 1 use i thought my skin seemed a little clearer as in not as many deep blemishes
i barely noticed any difference after using this mask
nothing about my face changed afterwards however.
no lasting results or claim to 'clear skin'
i can't imagine what damage would have been done had i been wearing acrylics
i didn't notice much of a difference in my skin
i can say that there was little to no change in my skin after using this mask
there were a few problems though
my skin changes like weather
i did not see a difference in my pore size at all
didn't see any difference in my skin compared to previous moisturizer i was using that was less than half the price
the only thing i had changed in my routine was the incorporation of the water cream
i could be coincidental
i didn't notice a difference while using it
my initial impression was not a good one
unfortunately i saw no change
in fact if anything it made my wrinkles a touch worse??
i saw zero change there
unfortunately i don't have any positive outcomes from this product
because i saw no noticeable difference using this serum
i still saw no difference from either product
i did not notice any differences after i finished an entire bottle
while my skin hasn't broken out o also have not noticed any vast improvements to my dark spots
for my skin needs which are sun damage /sun spots i saw no difference in the color of my skin tone nor any benefits
nothing has changed in my skin at all
it also hasn't made my skin worse
however, this product disappointed.
the fact that it triggered a headache makes me need to return
i've noticed that my dry patches have become much more frequent
my first unfavorable review has disappeared.
it did not improve my fine lines or dark circles whatsoever
honestly i haven't seen any real improvement since using it
the under eye serum just didn't show real improvement in the fine lines
while i don’t think this serum made my lines worse
have noticed no difference
didn't see noteworthy changes
i noticed that my circles were lighter
the fine lines became much more apparant
have not experienced this problem in the past
however the eye serum has not met my expectations
i don't see where it has made any improvements -- no brightening effect which i was hoping for
didn't see any improvement at all.
my skin has been really stable lately
nothing else in my routine changed
every other product i have tried from drunk elephant quickly made a huge difference in the condition of my skin
i've had no eye problems
have already had problems with leaking
was surprised when this product made my skin feel so bad
i saw a significant decrease in the amount of products after just a week
i didn't feel a difference in the way my skin felt or looked
i noticed that every time i used it
since it was the only thing i had changed
was just overall uncomfortable
had none of the desired effects after removing
i didn't notice a difference after taking it off.
i did notice a difference in my skin texture
unnoticed no changes in my skin
gave me a slight headache
didn't notice a big change
however if i had a skin emergency
wasn't amazed by the initial results
i just didn't notice any change to my skin before
i've had no problems with my oily t-zone
the products i have used have never caused me any irritation
i noticed that the ball has gotten significantly smaller
didn't notice any difference after using this a few times
there was no difference in my skin except that it was dryer than normal
haven't noticed anything really special about this
i make bad decisions
literally see no difference in my skin
saw a negative effect on my skin
i found no difference in my skin
i also don't really notice improvements in the overall brightness of my skin
i literally saw/felt no effects
it is slight at best
honestly saw no difference in my skin
there is still no noticeable difference at all in my skin
haven't noticed much of a difference in my skin
i did not really see a drastic difference.
i expected to see a difference in my skin
no real difference as far as skin texture
no difference at all.
haven't seen any results at all
it actually lost firmness
wrinkles have not diminished at all
the few wrinkles i have were magnified
my uneven skin tone became even more apparent
my skin had no change
see no difference whatsoever
i also never breakout
wondering if that's a direct cause of this mask as it is the only thing that has changed in my skincare
i did notice a huge difference in the condition of my skin
have shown no signs of change unlike the other people reviewing this product
although it had a cooling effect
however i saw zero difference.
the second day i only did one half of my face to see if it would be a noticeable difference
i think this has replaced some
the only downside is that my skin felt sticky even long after the initial application
i didn't notice to much of a brightening effect
so this is just my first impressions
see if my opinion of it improves
nor did i notice any added glow.
i noticed no difference in texture or skin tone.
didn't get any negative reaction from it-
still see absolutely no difference
i didn't notice any difference in my skin
my skin has been amazing lately
subtle effects so far
i didn't notice much of a difference in the evenness of my skin tone
there was no other noticeable difference
i did notice some immediate effects
i didn't notice any improvement in fine lines or brightness
the only thing that i changed as a part of my daily habits was using this serum
i didn't notice a change in any fine lines or wrinkles
the only thing that i noticed was it made my face a little softer
i didn't notice any sort of drastic changes
did not see an improvement in my texture
however i was mostly underwhelmed by the claims they made
i think that had an effect on my over all experience
this was the only product that had changed
i saw no decrease in wrinkles
no significant change in firmness
my skin tone didn't change at all either.
i would see more changes
out of all the product claims it mentioned other women noticing
was unable to use it longer than that due to skin irritation
overall i believe that this product helped reduce my forehead/expression lines initially
i think it may have diminished a bit of fine lines
on day three i noticed several blemishes starting to appear
i did not experience any improvement in my dark circles or fine lines while i tried it
just once or twice i noticed some luminosity
no change in dark circles
i also noticed it does soften fine lines.
haven't seen any results with 3 weeks in wearing this
i started having some skin reaction
the difference was extremely obvious
have seen absolutely zero changes in the texture
they haven't gotten any lighter
i didn't notice any difference after 2 months use
i did not see any differences
i could feel my skin tightening after usage
i've noticed my skin is a bit brighter since using
not much change to lines
have not noticed any visible difference :
i could feel the difference in my skin
i definitely notice a general difference in reduced dullness
i immediately saw results in the texture
i don't think it has made a difference in my skin whatsoever
my skin started to improve
the brightening effect was gone as well
have not noticed any change in my skin
it has the consistency
i just haven't seen any noticeable changes in my skin itself since starting to use this
the brightening effects are only temporary
especially if you have a keener-than-average sense of smell
throughout the day i noticed that instead of counteracting my oiliness it just appears to add to it
my skin in the morning felt more dry than it ever has
i didn't notice any difference
i am not sure how much it improved the pigmentation
has some good aha however
haven't noticed any results on my combination skin
if anything my acne has gotten worse since i started using this product
do notice a positive difference
i see a difference in skin tone
the only change in my regime was this serum
i heard this was an amazing product for scars
noticed so many more bumps
i noticed no benefits
i didn't notice any brightening or any other benefits
the only positive is it didn't make me break out or have any adverse effects
i didn't notice any positive effects either.
have never had a reaction from any product before
i notice a slight difference
the chance of a repeat experience
i didn't notice any changes to my skin while using it for two weeks
saw this happened to a lot of people
saw no changes in my skin
i wouldn't say this has dramatically changed my face
it has helped it reduce dark marks a bit
with the change in weather
the only difference i noticed was that i was more oily
it hasn't improved with my current breakouts
i change to another product
my skin looked progressively worse the longer i used it
there was no denying this was the culprit.
although there was nothing wrong with this
did not feel any tightness
i noticed an increasing amount of flaking throughout my face
this cream was such a disappointment.
the regular smell was magnified times 100
they have changed the formula.
i get the same effect with other br
the smell was also stronger than i had expected.
this is literally the worst facial product i've ever bought
the acnes are better after i stopped using it
didn't notice any changes
it hasn't gotten better
this felt very similar
although i have had no blemishes arise
this product caused me to breakout
plus i had previously been on a different retinol
have noticed better results from other skin treatments within the same amount of time
never had a reaction like this
my skin didn't improve
i've never been a girl that had sensitive skin or had issues with any product
not noticing any kind of change in my skin with this product
it has not made immediate differences
there are two things that i have noticed
first the wrinkle between my eyebrows has improved
night didn't notice any difference
there has been no real improvement in my dark circles
tried for 3 weeks, no difference seen
lately i am noticing fine lines in that area that are more visible than before
i see no visible difference in using this product
i see no effects of the product
i saw no difference with this product.
it made my wrinkles appear temperaily deeper after using it
i've noticed a drastic reduction of the dark circles normally under my eyes
haven't seen any difference as of yet
i've noticed no difference between this
i see absolutely no difference in my dark circles or puffiness
it seemed like i noticed a difference in puffiness the first application
not sure if i am seeing any change in the circles
have not seen noticeable difference
it hasn't done anything to decrease my dark circles
have made a noticeable different
i didn't notice much difference in my skin after using it
it did not visibly change my problem areas at all
might have been an allergic reaction too
this one is no exception
caused a breakout even though i am 40
for some reason my reaction to it has worsened
i am disappointed that formulas seemed to have changed
removing eye make up is one of my main concerns
the sales person said that others had similar complaints
never had any complaints
they recently changed the formula
this last purchase i noticed they changed the formula
which gives me the impression that this cleanser was the culprit
blemishes than i have ever had
made no difference what so ever.
there was no change at all to my face
this made blemishes worse if anything
this made no difference on my breakouts.
i tried this everyday for two months--it made no difference with my blemishes near my chin
since my skin isn't any clearer
there is no noticeable difference
i can't say i saw any difference in how the boscia treatment helped prevent acne or clear up problem areas
liked the cooling effect it has
none of them showed any improvement
used the item bottle and saw no improvement.
didn't seem to clear my blemishes.
i didn't really notice any difference when i used it on my blemishes
the formula did nothing for the "spots" on my skin whatsoever
the fact that it is a clear gel
i finish the product and i see zero difference!
i didnt notice any signficant changes on the areas where i applied this product
i saw some review
none left with no result
i didn't notice one difference in my skin after using this a few times
i didn't notice a big difference between my breakouts before or after using this product
it did not seem very effective on my blemish
i saw no difference
my breakouts need something much stronger
say no improvement whatsoever
for the past 5 days i can not apply anything to my eye area without experiencing a burning sensation
have never been disappointed
i don't see any positive difference
no complaints if using tiny amount!
haven't seen much improvement
unfortunately the effect was only temporary
instead of seeing any improvement
there has been no change with hyper pigmentation
didn't notice any brightening or lightening effects
haven't seen any improvement on my dark skin
there was no benefit to my skin
which had literally zero affect on my skin in that regard whatsoever
saw no different in appearance
however this was overwhelming
immediately noticed the strong
i did not notice any changes in skin brightness
don't notice any wow effect with brightening
i did notice brightening
i didn't notice any difference in the brightness of my skin
its not wowing in the brightening department either
didn't notice any of the brightening results
not happy about the changes!
it just overall was harsher than i expected.
other than that, i didn't notice a difference.
but havent noticed much difference.
despite the fact that this says 'all in one'
though there have been a h
i noticed that my skin was starting to break out a lot more than normal
it immediately made my face worse
have not noticed any difference.
i don't see any difference betweekn my cheeks
i've seen more dramatic results from other creams
i did not see any major improvement.
i havnt yet seen any type of results
horrible-used the whole bottle-no change at all.
saw no visible results
i do feel a tightening sensation when it is first applied
he said i'd see "instant results".
i used this product for two months with absolutely no improvement in my skin
i used fir a few weeks and saw no change.
i never saw any improvement when using this product
i noticed some results the first week
saw no improvement overall
my pores look smaller since i have begun using this product
my problem with it is
saw absolutely no reduction in the size of my pores
it has not diminished the appearance of my pores much if at all
there was no noticeable difference in the size of my pores
didn't notice any changes
i see only a slight change in the appearance of pores
i did not notice any difference in the amount of debris in my pores
i've noticed virtually no difference in pore size
not sure if ive noticed a difference in pore size
it says some have noticed pore size reduction within minutes
i did not notice any difference in the size of my pores after using this product
so far i have noticed no change in my pores
didn't see any difference in pore size in nose area
i did not notice a $100 difference
i noticed less bumps
i did notice that i had less breakouts as compared to other lotions that i've used though
while it hasn't made my skin any worse
the breakouts have gotten better though
have had blemish free skin forever
have not seen a significant reduction of reddness
did not really see any improvement in my redness either
furthermore my skin appeared more irritated.
i didn't see a difference in color
can tell if there is improvement as compared to my right eye
i might notice a bit of lightening.
they have not firmed or diminished dark circles
i really haven't seen any results
there has been no improvement in the dark circles at all
has made some what of an improvement in the discoloration
haven't seen any change at all
saw no visible results
it hasn't done much to improve the condition or visibility of my dark circles
the effects are great in the morning
the result not spectacular.
i primarily wanted something to diminish undereye circles
so far i haven't seen any permenant results
sadly that's the only difference i've seen
it didnt work in fact it made my skin worse
no specific complaints about my skin
i didn't experience any tingling that other reviews mentioned
i didn't see any noticeable results
i decided to give it the benefit of the doubt since my makeup was heavy
on the positive side though
this product really made it worse
my skin has been doing very well lately in terms of acne
nor did it diminish the dark spot i have
i feel like nothing has changed for my skin
i wasn't left with a great impression
not only did it not make any positive changes to my skin
my main concern is with my pore size
haven't really seen much improvement
my skin tone hasn't got any visible change.
i decided to start with one product first to see if there would be a visible difference
we both not seen any changes
i also did not notice any dark spot correcting
i hoped to see a difference with regular use of this serum
no problems so far with skin irritation or anything like that
i switched to the balm one that really made a difference for me
maybe i was expecting to much from an eye cream.
i started noticing that i developed an allergic reaction to this product
i don't even see minimal change using this product
i sadly did not see any improvement in my puffiness
there may be a slight decrease
which just adds to my dissatisfaction
it makes no difference in the puffines of my eyes or the appearance of deep circles
this is the only product i've found that hasn't cause any breakouts for me around my eye area
have not seen a noticeable difference in the skin around my eyes
have noticed nothing different
i don't notice an improvement in lines or dark circles
it did absolutely nothing for improving my concerns
no real immediate or lasting results
i could see where this immediately improved the look under my eyes
did nothing to improve skin texture or reduce the appearance of fine lines
have not noticed any change so far
i do feel a slight firming effect
the lines are not so noticeable
sephora has a great return policy with no hassels
this product has had a remarkable effect on the lines i have at the corners of my eyes
my skin had been looking less than stellar
i see no difference between using this
the only benefit i have seen since using this is that my makeup sits fine over it
the smell that others have reported as bad i found okay
as i was using this product i didn't really notice if it brightened
i never noticed any difference positive or negative
i didn't see any reduction in poor size
there isn't a noticable difference in my pore size either
thinking it was a fluke because none of the cleansers i have used in the past even remotely bothered my eyes
i did notice after the first use that it had reduced the amount of blackheads on
have not yet seen a difference
i think i notice a little bit of improvement.
i did not notice a big change in my skin or pores
disappointed because i had picked this based on positive reviews
my face is overall better
saw no improvement after finishing most of a jar
it hasn't made my face worse
i experienced similar results
i don't notice much difference with my pores
i saw no visible difference of any kind
did not see a difference in my pores
visible- i really wanted this to work
it actually made it worse
t's products made better impression on me
it made no change in my skin :
this product produced absolutely no change in skin
it has made a difference in my skin tone
it has not made the pores on my face any smaller.
it had the opposite effect it was supposed to.
i saw absolutely no difference in the pores
i used in the past with no problem
if the outside has changed this dramatically
there was absolutely no effect or change in my skin condition
absorbent however i really haven't seen any difference in my skin after using it for about 3 weeks
i also didn't see any improvement in my skin tone
did not note marked improvement in skin softness
i really haven't noticed any difference
there hasn't been a noticeable difference in the red scars
my fine lines have not increased
my problem was some of the ingredients that i had noticed in this product
for my average daily life i got something lighter
i liked the sheer luster and it was discontinued.
this one is no exception.
didn't see any big difference in the texture
saw no major changes on my skin
i didnt noticed any improvement on my skin tones
which has helped my skin
the fact that it absorbed quickly
showed me this product
the effect does not last long
have not noticed any change
it has no discernable smell to me
yet no improvement to my dark circles
after 4 weeks of use i have not noticed any big changes
it has not changed my eye area one bit.
i didn't notice a reduction in my under eye circles
however, there were some major setbacks.
have noticed an increase in the number of eyelashes i've been shedding
i did not see any changes to my under-circles or fine lines
i've changed products since using all of this one
it hasn't made anything better or worse on the dark circles front
cons: i think it have me small eye irritation in the beginningi don't see any improvement on the skin around my eye
which is what she thought was causing the reaction
it was the greatest product ever to help dark circles
i did not see any noticable differences in puffiness
i saw no improvement in my fine lines or wrinkles
i did not see any difference in dark circles or puffiness
this year i've seen mini wrinkles appear possibly from the lack of sleep from doing last minute assignments
saw absolutely no difference after 2 months of use
didn't feel like had made a difference at all when i removed it
have noticed some improvement
there has been no difference
i started noticing that my dark circles have gotten worse
it's been a month now and no changes, whatsoever.
i see no change under my eyes
just thought people should be aware of this discrepancy
unfortunately the eye cream did not appear to make any difference
have noticed a slight improvement in the overall darkness of the circles under my eyes
i saw no results
i didn't notice a big difference
have seen no decrease in dark circles under eyes
i didn't notice much of a difference for my skin
ing in either direction compared to the other masks i have in my rotation
i dont have any major skin concerns
no immediate change on my skin.
i don't see any improvement
i didn't notice any change afterward considering its heavy price tag
but no results on the wrinkle front!
i do not see any improvement in my skin.
i wish i could say that i've seen dramatic results
t was not a complete surprise
didn't notice any visible differences
really did not find a tangible change or result
still haven't seen any improvement with the annoying crows feet wrinkles
however i haven't really noticed any difference in the fine lines around my eyes
have not noticed the slightest bit of difference in wrinkle reduction
i saw no improvements at all on dark circles
made my lines more prominent
no noticeable results after 2 months.
at least decrease some of the lines
it actually felt like it tightened my skin.
have been wanting to make a shift toward more natural skincare
there has been absolutely no progress
like there was a s
then they changed the packaging
it just hasn't been the same
didn't notice any improvement after about a week
had to return it due to the fragrance which is quite prominent
i did not notice any lifting/ firming after a full bottle's use
for the lines around my mouth i find no improvement
plus i haven't noticed a much difference in fine lines
not much change in lines.
i felt those fine lines looked worse
noticed absolutely no change
really surprised to see so many positive reviews
it has the worst consistency ever
i never noticed any difference in the skin around my eyes or lips
haven't had any adverse reactions to it
i do find that there is no lessening of fine wrinkles around my eyes
i didn't see any immediate effects or changes as claimed
i've noticed a slight improvement in the lines under my eyes
although nothing super dramatic.
haven't noticed any differences in my eye area as compared to other eye creams i've tried
any eye cream is better than none
after 4-6 weeks you will see a difference in the reduction of the fine lines
i did not see much of an impact around my eyes or lips
the first thing i noticed was the color.
the disappointment though is that this never removed all of my makeup
has no one else had this issue?
was not as intense
didn't see any real difference in firming.
just not much difference
my fine lines weren't improved
very disappointed that this spendy eye cream has not improved my eye area
am less than impressed
no other type of improvements were noticed
i could not see any changes
i've seen absolutely no brightening or lifting
there is no change
i honestly have not seen any firming
did not notice any firming
have not noticed any firming around my eye area
did not notice any difference in the eye area
visible results with it
although i didn't see much decrease in the appearance of fine lines
haven't seen any results for brightening my under eyes
the alcohol in the product made his skin more red than it already was
have no under eye problems
i noticed milia start to come in
did not see the slightest difference
saw no difference in appearance of fine lines
i did not notice any change whatsoever.
however i cannot say i have noticed an improvement in my dark circles
i did not notice any significant changes when i stopped using it either
have not seen a difference
didn't see a difference in appearance
have not seen a difference with fine lines
but i haven't noticed anything since then.
this is the first clinique product that i've used that actually irritated my eyes
really i saw no difference after using this cream
i didn't see any change in my dark circles
recently though i've noticed it's been making my t-zone dry
it made my skin even worse
with continous use i have noticed larger pores
haven't been that impressed
i've haven't noticed any difference in my skin
consistency of the mask at first
have seen little to no difference
like big noticeable break outs.
which diminished soon after removing the mask
this mask makes no difference to my skin
i don't notice much change in my skin
it made no change to my face
my skin saw no benefit from this
did nothing to help skin appearance
didn't see any effect on line reduction.
i recently noticed that this product has gotten the least amount of use
it has no rough texture in any sense of the word.
the biggest problem for me is that i noticed it made my eyelashes fall out
didn't see any improvements
didn't notice a large difference with my eye area
as for the brightening maybe i expect miracles
gave it the benefit of the doubt
i didn't notice a change so i returned it.
huge improvement in my eye area
i don't see an obvious improvement under my eyes.
i just never saw any real results
i didn't notice any real difference with hydration or firmness
my skin was not getting better, nor worse.
i've never seen my skin look as terrible as it did
ever since i've been using this it got worse
i noticed it was making my breakouts worse
my breakouts never got better.
i don't see much difference between this one
i don't think it makes a dramatic difference in my skin
literally no difference the entire day.
it was a big disappointment
i didn't see a change in the size of my pores
i didn't notice a difference in my pores
t was because of this primer because that was the only thing i changed in my routine
the consistency is different
much to my surprise- there was no response at all
they denied any formula change.
it was the same consistency
didit see much difference when i put it on half face to compare the difference
great at oil observing for sure
saw no major differences even though i used it religiously every day
the other side had no primer
no difference in the appearance of my pores
it definitely has a blurring effect
i still had the occasional blemish
did not notice any difference.
i didnt really see a change in my skin from before
not seen much of a difference in my skin
the serum hasn't changed them at all
had great brightening effects
my biggest complaint is that it doesn't spread well on the face
even after weeks of using it i didn't notice any difference in my skin texture or tone
saw no change or improvements in my skin
i noticed pores that have never been obvious to me before
i didn't notice that my skin looked any better after using it
that made a difference almost immediately
i do not see any difference in my skin whatsoever after almost finishing the first bottle
didn't notice any difference in lines
i didn't notice any fine line reduction in the two weeks that i used it
i see no visible changes
i really have not seen any difference in my skin
none of which have gotten any brighter.
it had no effect whatsoever in a month of faithful use
i noticed that i've been breaking out a lot more
my pores have never been that visible before
i don't see any skin improvements after using this
i didn't see any improvement while using the product
i also had some slight irritation.
the product has no irritated my skin
i've used it for months with no noticeable improvement
yet i wouldn't expect dramatic results
it hasnt improved my skin at all
i can not see any noticable difference in the appearance of blemishes
didnt have any effect on tired eyes
have used it daily to no affect
her skin have bad reaction to it
i didn´t notice any difference in my eyes
have seen no difference in my skin
sadly with no results
i never feel any burning sensation or any breakout
it was no comparison
worse i ever used.
saw no changes in my skin.
i did not see any improvements in texture or wrinkles
ithe effect seemed to be only very temporary
no difference at all in my skin's appearance
this product did nothing beneficial for my skin
no complaints so far though.
i didn't notice much of a difference.
i used half of the container without ever noticing a difference
i did not notice a significant difference with dark circles or wrinkles
i don't think i have seen a difference in fine lines
as far as wrinkle resist i can't say i notice any improvement for lines or wrinkles
my main concerns were fine lines
i can honestly say i have *not* noticed an improvement in my eye area since beginning this product
under eye wrinkles have not changed
still see absolutely no difference in my fine lines or dark circles
i noticed after applying this products
unfortunately i didn't notice any difference in the skin around my eyes
my question: has anyone else noticed lash loss from using this product?
did not see a difference in dark circles
visible smoothing effect after just a few applications
it was very troubling
those seemed to have improved some
although i saw no reversal
literally nothing has changed
got a sample, made absolutely no difference.
absolutely see an improvement in my fine lines
the issue was i saw none
but it wasn't matifying whatsoever.
i saw absolutely zero mattifying effect
this just made it worse
i did not see an increase in breakouts
see no marked improvement.
the only positive i had was that it absorbs quickly
i must be one of the few that had no noteable change
my fine lines are less noticeable
i didn't notice to much change after using it
i didn't notice any improvements in my skin
because i have not noticed any anti-aging benefits either
over time i noticed it was really drying my skin out even worse than it already is
i also did not notice any brightening effects as it claims
as far as brightening effects go
thought that my skin just needed to get adjusted to the change
they changed the formula
everyone noticed a difference in my skintone after 1 month
made absolutely no difference in my skin.
didn't notice any change in hyperpigented spots.
not sure i'm noticing much if any differance in my skin tone or apperance
other than a blemish from it
recently switched to this one because of the brightening formula
not sure if i see any brightening effects
while i am aware it is supposed to be lightening it made my whole face look pale
still did not see any improvements on my skin
haven't noticed any of what it promises
they focused too much on the appearance
this is the worst cream with spf i have ever had.
not only did i not see any changes to the brown spots on my skin
haven't noticed a huge difference in my skin's brightness
i didn't see any result whatsoever.
haven't seen a major change in the freckles or color on my face
this eye cream has been around for a long time without many changes to the formula
with no changes in my under eye area
no difference and a waste of money.
the only beneficial thing i noticed was the reduction of my dark circles
i can't say that i have noticed a difference at all in the discoloration or lines around my under eyes
this is something i noticed for almost all clinique products
i do not notice any difference when it comes to under-eye dark circles
no hydration, no brightening, no lifting.
this product doesnt do much for brightening
since it didn't irritate my skin whatsoever
honestly saw no results
have seen absolutely no results
haven't seen much of a difference
i don't see any changes around my eye are
by morning my eyes are only very marginally improved from when i don't wear it
my breakouts have actually gotten worse since i've been using this product
a pimple that was already on my face was decreased in size quickly
my skin didn't improve
was hoping that this product would help improve my skin complexion
although it did reduce the redness a little in the first week
after a while it really didn't seem to make an impact on my skin
i noticed my foundation was still on my skin
bought this as i felt my skin was changing
in result, i had to return it.
not just a little i had a rough reaction
noticed a difference in my face
i am yet to notice any improvement on my skin
it is not cooling whatsoever.
i said my main concern was more the alcohol evaporating so closely to my eyes
did not notice any change in colour under my eyes
i saw zero results.
i didn't see any difference for my eye area
i don't see a lot of improvement on my dark circles or in general
i used the gel for several weeks without any noticeable effects or improvements
this didn't make much of an impact
felt/saw no difference
it doesn't really absorb all that well so that the fine lines were accentuated
i cannot see any visible results :
no changes at all in eye area.
my fine lines were more obvious
no visible results yet...goes on easily
there wasn't a noticeable change in my appearance
despite the good reviews i had to return this cream
haven't had that same drying effect
i don't see any improvements except maybe my skin is slightly more luminous
i don't notice any difference in my fine lines or wrinkles
is that this mask has no visible lasting effects
i really haven't noticed any difference in my skin
i don't think it has changed pore size
used it once noticed a little difference in my pores
didn't produce any dramatic results for me
however i felt like it was almost too mild
was totally convinced i would see remarkable improvements in my skin tone
didn't notice great skin improvement
since switching to kate sommerville's line i've noticed vast improvement compared to this product
at first i did see an improvement
i literally noticed a difference the 3rd time using it
i noticed my makeup goes on a lot smoother
i also didn't see any improvements
even saw new breakouts emerge
my previously existing blemishes were worse
its been so stressful knowing its very visible
hasn't done much to help control breakouts
i did not notice any improvements at all
it only had a very limited result
it certainly hasn't gotten better
saw a nearly immediate improvement in my skin
have not noticed any difference
so far i have not noticed major changes
i need a lot of it since my whole face is affected
why this formula was changed
even the cap was changed
the last time i ordered it i noticed the consistency had changed
i did not notice a reduction in pores
i didn't notice any differences to my face after a month of use
in days saw positive change
t seen a big change
it seems to have a mattifying effect
texture has improved since i started using it
didn't see a difference on my skin
reactive skin that's starting to show its first aging signs
reactive skin that's starting to show its first aging signs
haven't seen any noticeable improvements in my skin
have been less than pleased
this product has not even slightly diminished the fine lines or wrinkles
no big improvements yet
using it for weeks and see no difference.
this has had little effect on my eye wrinkles
it was obvious that the culprit was this cream.
have not noticed an appreciable difference in my medium under eye wrinkles
do not notice any change the lines around my eyes
have had no improvement in wrinkles at all
tere is no way that my under-eye wrinkles have been reduced by 52%
now i am seeing a slight improvement
i see no results
no positive results whatsoever
thought i'd splurge since i'm starting to get noticeable wrinkles around my eyes
the benefit of the doubt
after using it i could see a little difference in the fine lines around my eye area
this actually made my skin breakout more
made it much worse
i originally bought it to help clear blemishes
cheeks where i had never even gotten a single blemish
this was completely unexpected
it made my breakout even worse
that my face has gotten softer
i really notice its presence
i don't see any improvement for my skin.
it didn't improve my skin
my acne is the worst it has ever been in my life
it really hasn't made a difference
no change for the better
there wasn't a single change in my skin
none of the products cleared any imperfections
i think my skin just progressively got worse
3 it seriously made my skin worse
it significantly reduced the size of a blemish overnight
this is the first time i've ever had this problem
haven't seen any major improvement in my acne
it has had absolutely no effect on my skin
discomfort in those areas for a week or more
i mean it felt like i had suffered through a severe chemical burn
waited for even the slightest result
i saw absolutely no results.
seems to have no effect on others
have seen no results
still had a negative experience with this product
since this had received so many positive reviews on google
my skin has improved tremendously since then
initially i did see a difference.
after that it just lightened my marks really little
while using it i barely had any breakouts
didn't see any improvements at all
which is no problem
didn't see much of an improvement from my acne marks
didn't notice any improvements
absolutely no change after two bottles.
really disappointed with this "lightening" gel.
i didnt see any lightening at all
in fact the marks i had on my skin got more red than before
unfortunately i have not had positive results with this product
i am disappointed with the lack of change in the discoloration
still see no change
it had zero effect change was highly disappointing
my skin is worse than it was
my skin is worse than it was
i never saw lightening of any of my acne marks nor of the new ones this gel created
when i first received this it seemed to work a bit at first in lightening the scars
the other reviews said they saw a difference immediately
while my skin hasnt gotten worse
don't think the results are very dramatic
i feel like i have seen a slight improvement
the lightening was very minimal
no breakout at all!
i didnt see any other effects on my skin
so that was positive
i didn't see any change in my skin as far as lighter pigmentation after using this product
can't really notice a difference on my face after a month
with minor breakouts the next morning that only become exasperated with continued use
i saw no difference after using this
none of ptrs un wrinkle products have changed the condition of my skin at all
did not absorb for me nor did it have any impact on any imperfections as it claimed
without any visible success on my sunspots
no worse than other night creams i have tried
i saw no improvement in fine lines
didn't affect my fine lines
didn't really see changes
shoulders had no improvement
there has been no change in the frequency of my back breakouts
i'll have small outbreaks from time to time
however i don't see a huge difference in acne at all
seemed to make things worse
didn't notice any difference in my skin
never changed my mind
no changes seen in my current acne issues either.
also caused a lot of texture in places i have never had that problem before
i've noticed more breakouts since using this product
my skin hasn't looked this bad in years
have not seen much change
have not noticed any improvements in my skin
there were no big problems with it
made absolutely no difference in my skin.
was pointed to the boscia skin care line
didn't notice any difference in my skin
in fact they seemed to have gotten worse
saw no change in clearer complexion or reducing my acne
now my skin is the clearest it's ever been
it hasn't done much to help reduce my breakouts
that's normal since it does have a gel-like consistency
sadly it made hardly no difference
for anything more severe
i didn't really notices any difference after using it for about a month
on the weekends with no makeup there was no reduction in oil
i still don't see any big improvement
it did absolutely nothing to clear my complexion.
no change-good or bad.
didn't notice a difference at all
i noticed a difference right away
i didn't notice any difference as far my breakouts
i also did not see any improvement in my skin
i didn't notice any difference in my complexion whatsoever
since i do suffer from consistent
my overall acne situation did not quite improve at all
this did nothing to clear my blemishes.
this hasn't changed my skin at all.
this one was a bit of disappointment
i did not see any noticeable change in redness which wouldn't be a big deal if it was at least a decent cleanser
very disappointed with this product it has not helped at all with my redness
never see any result
haven't seen any difference at all
i did not notice any significant reduction in redness
even worse it really made my skin breakout
within 3 days i noticed that no new breakouts were popping up
it neither improved or aggravated my skin though
the moisture-restoring has happened
didn't see any obvious change
which didn't concern me at first
plus it has no moisterizing effect.
since the name of this product is "redness solutions" i thought it was a no brainer
in fact it seems like it has gotten worse.
it did not make any difference in my skin tone
so far no instant effects
haven't noticed any changes in tightening or diminished lines
didn't notice any effect on the fine smile lines i have
do not notice any improvements after 20 days
i never saw any effect or change.
i did not notice any difference in my skin texture
i didn't notice any immediate changes
never noticed a difference while using this mask.
i don't see any lasting effects happening with my tone or pores
there are a number of great brightening masks out there
there was no improvement to my skin.
never really saw a difference
i didn't notice any difference in my skin after taking it off
there was no noticeable difference aside from leaving my skin soft for a few hours
i see no real difference after use
i felt or saw no difference in my skin
i never noticed any real changes to my skin.
i didnt notice much improvement on anything that they claimed was going to improve
it began to visibly change color
i never really noticed a difference
i did not see any noticeable "brightening" of my skin
my only complaint is that the shape of the container is an odd shape
i don't see changes in my skin
didn't notice any difference
not sure if there had been a noticeable difference
compared to any of the other brightening br
didn't see any change in my skin
it had no effect on my dark circles or anything really
i do see a slight improvement in my skin
never seen or felt a difference.
was detracted by price
i did notice a difference when i used the product
since i saw several reviews online stating that this product has stained fingers
i really havent notice much changes on my skin
probably haven't gotten the full effect yet
i see no difference
i see absolutely no change
i used the entire jar and no change.
haven't seen any results
i feel like the fine lines in the under eye area have worsened in the last 6 weeks of use
been using nightly as per instructions with no visible difference
after 3 weeks i haven't really seen any improvement
i literally see no difference
i gave it an honest 3 months of use to see any improvement
saw absolutely no results
not even progress towards results.
i did not notice any improvement in my dark circles
there's a very slight almost not noticeable difference my dark circles were very pronounced before
my dark circles have not improved
definitely saw a brightening effect at the end of the week
in 3 weeks i saw absolutely no change whatsoever :
i don't think i used it long enough too see the effects of the eye brightening effects
i no longer see it's effectiveness
i do notice a difference, but only slightly.
not only have i not seen an improvement
it was all disappointment
i saw absolutely no results whatsoever.
have not seen much change on my under eyes yet
have not seen hardly any results
just havnt seen any result
with absolutely no difference on the dark circles i started not using it twice a day
i still did not notice any reduction in dark under-eye circles
i did not see any improvement for my dark circles
i find that lately the flakes are actually more noticeable than usual
my fine lines became more noticeable
the dramatically different gel
my skin became worse
i quickly changed my mind
i also don't see a big difference in my skin
i will say my forehead line that bothers me is also less noticeable
i also don't see much improvement in fine lines or other skin issues
i saw improvement of my skin after a week
don't really notice a difference with fine lines
i did see any noticeable results
it's a small sample to small to notice any changes
i don't notice any of positive effects
my opinion didn't change.
overall i was satisfied enough with the results
less noticeable if i used it over a serum
i did not notice any benefits to reducing fine lines or wrinkles
didn't actually improve my skin at all
haven't seen any difference in my skin at all
i see no diference or improvement in my skin at all
no change in my skin whatsoever.
my problem is gone
i just saw no difference after several months' use of the product
can't say i've seen any improvements
before then noticed things getting more noticeable
nor did i see improvement for dark circle
which were not lessened an iota
my undereye lines are becoming more noticeable
i've noticed no difference in my dark circles either which was one of the main reasons i tried this
so far i have not noticed much difference
have not see a difference
lately there has been no results for me
saw no change what so ever
no significant changes yet
this eye treatment has done nothing to reduce the fine lines around my eye area
i can say that it had no effect whatsoever on the fine lines around my eyes
no noticeable changes in my dark circles
haven't seen any results yet.
made my fine lines look worse
my main concern was depuffing
i've never had a reaction to any other product
let alone a reaction this severe
i detect a subtle change around my eye area [for the better]
on top of that haven't seen any improvements in my eye area
very expensive and have not seen any difference.
there has been no visable improvements
during that time it has diminished some of the fine lines around my eyes
so far i have not seen any difference.
i noticed it didn't absorb very well either even when i put on a miniscule amount on
my eye area looked actually worse than before
the lines were more noticeable
i saw no difference in my skin
haven't seen any difference
definitely no positive reaction either
okay so far, haven't seen a huge improvement
have noticed no change in the firmness of my skin or the lines diminishing
took the $195 plunge in hopes of a notable difference
the only difference was in my bank account.
since i've started using this cream my skin has had huge breakouts
because my skin hasn't reacted to a product like this before
as a result just made my skin look old
while i have not noticed drastic improvement
still have not seen any results
while i have noticed some firming
some i had terrible reactions to
was that the young lady who sold it to me assured me that i would notice visible results in my forehead lines
see absolutely no difference
have not noticed much difference yet
i noticed a slight burning sensation
didn't notice a difference in my skin
have not seen any improvement in my fine lines
so far i don't see a huge difference in my skin
this product was suggested for me due to having sensitive skin
like nothing has been applied
made the imbalance even worse
i've never had this problem
did not notice any effect on redness though
it does nothing for the overall improvement of my skin
by the end of the day i had new blemishes coming to the surface
nothing else in my routine had changed
i didn't notice any changes in my skin
it hasn't done much for my skin
no difference in my skin!
still had a significantly oily t zone
i still seem to have a slight reaction when i used it
i truly saw no real difference.
in terms of a difference in the look
i didn't notice any major differences either
no change in the texture of my skin
i didn't notice any changes to my skin
didn't see a visible difference
have yet to see even the slightest bit of difference in my face
i did not find wrinkle reduction or any boost in my skins tightness over time
no real skin difference
the cooling effect it has on my skin
seeing a few youtubers rave about it
even after one use the difference was extremely noticeable
38 now and concerned for aging signs.
refreshing mask that did not provide me with any noticeable results
i didn't notice any difference in my face appearance after use
i did not notice any difference in my skin after using multiple times
i noticed increased dryness within the very first use of this product
my complexion was uneven before i began using this
which has never happened
this was a definite no-go for my skin
i saw no difference between this product
to my surprise it is less than half gone
found no change in the hydration levels of my skin
haven't noticed any significant difference
this product made no change
started using it before my skin even showed signs of flakiness
it did not have any noticeable effect for me.
i see no difference in my skin
to see if there was any noticeable difference
product is too expensive in my opinion compared to the lack of results i saw
greasy mess for years before noticing the anti-aging effects
which hasn't happened to me with other clinique products
something has changed in this
clinique seems to have changed the formula
the consistency was completely different
haven't noticed any change in wrinkles yet
there is a slight "sting" to it
after just 3 days i noticed my skin was excessivly oily
have been greasy ever since
they since changed the formula
had no problems with any other product
none of their products have ever caused me to breakout
i've noticed my skin improving
reacts to smallest of changes in my skin care regime
i saw no improvements
recently have been noticing wrinkles under my eyes
haven't noticed anything really amazing yet
as far as improving the look of that skin
there was no "cooling effect" as others claim.
i slightly started to get noticeable break outs
honestly there was no difference
it made it worse
in fact made it worse
other than that i did not see any changes to my skin
this product definitely has a positive effect on my frown lines
my skin shows no improvement
you are not concerned about fine lines or wrinkles
i am going to finish using the product to see if there is a noticable change
no significant improvement has been found on my neck yet
i really saw very little in the way of line reduction
still no results whatsoever
i saw absolutely no improvement in my fine lines
it also claims to make imperfections less visible
after the very first use i was startled to notice that the product seemed to amplify the appearance of lines around my eyes
after a week not only had the lines not diminished the cream seemed to somehow amplify the appearance of lines i wanted to hide
it has done nothing for my wrinkles
have only seen mild improvement in fine lines.
did nothing to reduce/diminish fine lines
saw absolutely no improvement
even water would have corrected the dehydration i was experiencing in phoenix
cannot tell a noticeable difference in my upper lids
very little in my lower
didn't see any improvement in firmness.
and its lack of 'staying power' also amazed me.
i fear it has damaged my skin
found no difference in the area around my eyes
no improvements on laugh lines
have noticed subtle differences
i see no results.
no noticible fine line or wrinkle effect yet
so far, i have ot noticed any big difference.
i almost never breakout
my skin needed time to adjust
i gave it a week and no change.
my skin saw no improvement
it performed no better
this was one of the few products of the line that isn't a huge disappointment
it only got worse
haven't seen any difference in my skin
after reading reviews i was expecting an immediate change in my skin
haven't seen any results from it
my skin has actually gotten worse.
i didn't notice a difference at all
it is no substitute for my previous st
in my opinion it is too light
which is a definite plus
i just don't see any upsides to it besides the initial pleasant texture during application
i've never noticed it make any difference to my skin at all
i saw improvement after my first use
i noticed a little improvement, but not a ton.
had a reaction unlike anything i've ever experienced
by the end of the day there are wrinkles that i've never had before because of the dryness
only left the affected area dry
this product made no difference on my skin at all
on the positive side
my skin had never been better
i noticed this the first time i tested it
i didn't experience that side-effect
which i thought was unusal for a cleanser
i didn't see any improvement in my skins appearance after using it morning
an occasional blemish here or there
haven't seen any discernible results
i saw no results
this cream feels more substantial
there is no difference what so ever in puffiness
i don't see any difference in the skin around my eyes
i've not seen much change
i found nothing spectacular about it
i no longer see much of a difference in my skin when using this product
no noticeable results after 2 weeks.
have not noticed any difference
i noticed that my t zone was getting really slick
i do not notice any real changes to my skin
which was quite noticeable on my dark skin
they had represented there
so far i see no improvement in my skin after 1 month use
most regretted purchase i've ever made.
not even a slight difference.
i gave this product a "fair" rating because i have not noticed any difference in my skin's tone or texture
no other product has had quite the same effect.
i've also noticed some bumps under my skin that weren't there before--that i can't blame on this product with certainty
so far absolutely no change-
i don't see a huge improvement
there hasn't been any more improvements
noticed very minimal improvement in my skin's tone
felt like there was an improvement
have not noticed an improvement in my skin
there was no difference in the texture or tone
i see no difference in my pores
i didnt find much of a difference
none of them solve the problem by diminishing my pores
have had a similar reaction once from that
however i have not been impressed
i seen no difference in the appearance of my skin
making them even more visible
no change at all
this winter was the worse i have experienced since i was a kid
the only thing it did was cause dry skin that caused a breakout like i've never had
there's no difference between the two
i saw literally no difference
my skin has gotten worst as i get older
nor did it reduce the appearance of pores over time
that i saw no visible difference in my skin
seen no results at all
felt that it made no difference to their effectiveness
using this product made absolutely no difference with my pores
i seen no difference in my skin
i didn't notice a significant change at all
i didn't notice much of a difference over pore strips alone
i didn't see any noticable differences
haven't seen much of a difference
no improvement at all
it did nothing to improve the quality of my skin.
little-to-no change in under-eye bags
so far i couldn't see any improvement or changes
there has been no difference!
so far haven't noticed any change in my eyes
also note that i have really minor fine lines
i did not notice any change due to its use.
i did not notice any difference in the skin around my eyes after weeks of use
am unclear if it has made any difference to my face
i saw no lasting effects
no negative consequences from use other than a diminished bank acocunt
was hoping for a more dramatic change
can't really see any visible difference.
there was no real improvement
have been very pleased with the results
on the negative side
i did not see any improvement on my skin.
had to return it after 3 weeks of use as i didn't notice any changes on my skin
i certainly haven't seen any changes that would make me look in the mirror
my skin has been dramatically changed."
not noticed a difference using this
haven't seen a difference in my skin after 6 uses
i don't see any difference compared to before i started using it
didn't feel that my skin benefited from this product
almost had the consistency of a mask
haven't had any problems
my age spots were less noticeable
with the same result
i didn't notice any changes in my skin other that the fact that it looks
my wrinkles do not appear diminished in any way whatsoever
honestly didn't see a diference in less wrinkles or spots diminishing
this product has so much scent in it that it bothered my eyes
they have transformed my skin!
i don't feel a difference in skin texture or see a difference with my fine lines
just haven't seen the kind of results as i have with layering other products
had a way of lingering for quite some time
i could not see a major change
the only thing i noticed was that my skin was smoother
i didn't notice much of a difference in my skin
no noticeable difference with my skin
don't see any changes in my skin
the texture of my skin has changed greatly
even worse on the face
it did nothing to improve my skin
no real noticeable results
for lack of a better word
when this product first came out i was extremely excited since i suffer from mild hyper-pigmentation
no change in the spots tho
while it did greatly reduce my already there dark spots
sephora has yet to correct this issue.
my skin has been completely clear
has clinque caused anyone else to breakout?
haven't seen much improvement in sun spots on the face
i see no difference at all.
it really made no difference on my eye wrinkles
there was no improvement
after several weeks of use there was no other visible action
after using this for a month i don't feel i've seen to many changes
didn't notice any results
i don't see overwhelming improvement
i also work on the night shift so recently over the past year i feel that my dark circles have gotten worse
havent noticed any real changes yet
haven't seen much change at all
doesn't improve the appearance
i saw no difference in my eye area
i see no improvement in my dark circles
have not seen much of a difference in my dark circles
so far i really haven't seen an improvement
have noticed a slight difference in the fine lines around my eye area
my eyes actually started to look worse.
noticed no significant difference in fine lines or circles after 1 month+ of use
saw same results with much cheaper eye creams.
this did not produce any noticeable changes around my eyes
have seen slight changes
it was a massive disappointment.
very visible difference in my eye wrinkles
didn't notice any difference
nothing that was life changing
doesn't make any noticeable changes to the eye area
it does have a warming/tingling affect which i enjoyed because i felt like it made me look more awake
do not see a change in my dark circles
nothing has changed not one thing
i guess i was expecting more noticeable results
i didn't really notice a difference with my dark circles
there may be a slight difference
i saw absolutely no results.
did cause an awful skin reaction
the burning has increased
haven't noticed a lot of de-puffing yet
i saw no results whatsoever!
have seen absolutely zero change whatsoever
that has been the only change in my eye care
i didn't notice any difference after using this product a few times
did not notice much of a difference!
i didn't notice much of a difference
when i tried it burned like it has some type of plumping affect
is concerned with the ever so slight of lines under his eyes
i saw maybe a tiny difference between before
which is my problem
i did not notice a difference.
this product did nothing for me except for slight tingling sensation after application
maybe just a very very slight depuffing immediately after use
i never really notice a difference with eye products
didn't really see any noticable results
it does have a tingling effect upon application that was a little unusual
i became accustomed to it
so my this product made my skin worse over time
i really think this had an affect on the clarity of my skin
hoping to see a bit of difference
i did notice a difference after just 1-2 applications
this had to be the culprit because nothing else in my routine had changed
i see zero improvement
still saw no difference
it also hasn't made a giant difference in the redness either
it did not improve my redness in the slightest bit
it seemed to have upset my skin even more
i can honestly say i have not noticed any redness relief at all
it also caused me to breakout slightly
my flare-ups increased
i noticed it made my skin even more aggravated as i applied it
it actually made the color a little worse
caused me to have terrible breakouts on my normally clear checks
i didn't see a major difference
it had absolutely no effect on my skin
have to get that confirmed).
after using this for awhile i noticed that the redness in my skin spread even more on my face
i added it recently again to my consistent routine
noticed no changes whatsoever in the tone or color of my skin
this product was a huge disappointment.
i am only giving it three stars because i've never noticed even the slightest difference in my facial redness
saw a minimal difference in texture
have seen no difference with my skin at all
did not notice any "appearance" of lines
so far i haven't seen much difference in my skin.
this was the worst yet
i liked the transparency of knowing how much retinol was in the product
so far i am only feeling a slight bit smoother
i didn't notice any other benefit or change to my skin
it did not really improve my skin's texture
i can see a positive difference in how my skin feels
if this has made a difference
the first two weeks i saw a visible difference in my skins color
have seen no change in my light sun damage
found that it did nothing to reduce the appearance of pores
it was due to the alcohol so spending this much i expected more results with wrinkle reduction
there is nothing remarkable about this lotion in general
it did not appear to have any diminishing effect on my shiny face
found that while it slightly decreased oil
none of that matters because it has no sun protection
there is no difference in my fine lines
there was no "brilliant control" of oil or shine
thankfully sephora has such a great return policy
made no noticeable difference when compared to hope in a jar
it has caused no problems with my skin
have not noticed any brightening
the damage was done
didn't see any brightening or other positive signs related to using a new moisturizer
i doubt using it longer would have made a difference
i also didn't notice any difference
haven't noticed anything exceptional happening after using for about a month
it has the same effect as baby oil.
nothing too serious though
no, no, no, no!
saw no improvement of my breakouts nor prevention
with no changes to the current ones
i still notice breakouts only now in different areas as well
unfortunately it caused me to breakout.
my skin hasn't gotten better
still had the same breakouts
skin issues as i had before
have noticed no improvement in my skin
i noticed my face looking clear again
the results i have experiencedare a bit disappointing
clarity of my skin change
i 'm not positive this is making any difference
haven't seen any change
as i don’t notice any significant difference
no other change yet
on the positive side
to this moisturizer a couple of years ago i noticed an immediate improvement in my sensitive
i didn't see an improvement on my skin.
it was quite the reverse
the big problem with this though was the effects it had on my skin
the only thing i changed in my routine was my moisterizer
it had the exact same affect
i noticed that my skin was brightened when i used it am
haven't seen any results
not the other to see the difference
i've heard of different "quick fixes"
not a long lasting depuffing effect
absolutely no change to my under eye bags
didn't make a noticeable difference
it really has no effect on me
i returned this product after i started noticing wrinkles under my eyes
doesn't affect the 'wake'ful appearance of my eyes
haven't noticed any huge changes
there was no reduction in the puffiness under my eyes either immediately or long-term
overall i don't see any real improvement
guess it had a cooling effect
i did not see changes in the lines underneath my eyes after 1
the only thing i noticed from this serum
was really pleased with the results after one night- my skin definitely looked smoother
however i have not seen the firming results i had hoped for
it wasn't life changing
however i haven't noticed any difference in my eye area
the texture was wonderfuk but i saw no results.
i didn't notice any difference
i think that the problems got worse
saw absolutely no reduction of the dark circles
made my minimal lines more prominent
see absolutely no change in the area under my eyes
did not notice any changes in my skin
i did not notice any other improvements in my complexion
i saw no improvements to my skin
no negatives or positives for me.
it made no difference on my skin
the most disappointing part i noticed absolutely no difference in my wrinkles
no improvement for sure~ :(.
i did not notice any reduction in lines or clarity in my skin
i am not expecting a drastic difference
i did notice that my skin looked nice
i didn't feel that it had lasting effects
i've only seen a slight improvement
my fine lines appear to be a little less noticeable
i saw no results at all.
the smell ruled out any benefit i noticed
i used it along with the other cold plasmas for 3 months with no difference
maybe this formula changed
yet w/ one application my fine lines around my eyes are less noticeable
my eyes don't have enough problems to notice an improvement from heavy duty creams like this
this product has not made any visible improvements to my eyes
actually the lines around my eyes are more noticable to me
i saw no difference when compared to the philosophy product line
have seen a slight decrease in wrinkles
every skin is different
hasn't minimized the appearance of anything much since i started
i will update my review if i feel a serious change
applied the cream it had the scent of fish which we were unaware of
during the 10 days of use i saw no noticable effects consequently the product was returned
have not seen any noticeable changes in my skin
my skin had a terrible reaction to both this
this product has something in it that caused me to have an allergic reaction
in the first two day i couldn't notice any difference
this made it so much worse
i've read lately that no product has really
haven't been out much
what i notice is that it leaves like a corse film on my face not noticeable to the eye
didn't notice any difference in my skin
still have no improvement
the oil absorbing had lessened
i did not see any improvement in my acne
no improvement in my skin texture
i did not see a difference in my acne during use
i felt like this barely provided any moisturization
my breakouts have not improved since using this
it did nothing to clarify the large pores on
i also still had the same level of redness around that area
i also noticed that i had some little irritation bumps
the only positive is that i liked the consistency of the product
i didn't notice any difference to my skin.
but it made my acne even worse than it was.
it got worse--worse than it's been in a long time
mouth than i have ever had
even made it worse
there are definitely other things that have a more significant effect for calming blemishes
which makes me worry the the effectiveness is being lessened
did nothing to improve clarity
didn't notice a difference in managing my breakouts
nothing we tride it 2 times i saw about 3 or 4 blackheads on in the mask in total
i saw no difference at all.
didn't see any improvement in my skin
there was no change in my skin after using it.
this is no match
haven't seen many results
didn't see any noticeable difference after using the mask
say that it has done no harm to my skin
the mask hadn't removed anything or improved my skin in any sense
i noticed however that it is kind of week
didn't notice any improvements in my skin
it seems that a lot have surfaced up on the area
it makes no difference to my skin
when i tried it there was no difference
conclusion: did more damage than repair.
saw no noticeable difference after months of use.
the one positive was that my skin seemed less oily
she had the same experience
i don't see any improvement on my skin
i didn't notice any changes in my skin at all
didn't see any difference in my skin
no great improvement in my skin overall
which has never caused me any problems
haven't noticed any changes in my skin
i didn't notice a difference at all in the look of my skin as far as scars
i see no changes on my dark spots after more than 4 weeks of use
it actually made my skin look worse.
saw no change in my skin or fine lines
there was no improvement--basically just stayed the same
could see a clear improvement overnight
i didnt notice any visible changes.
i noticed zero difference after 4 weeks of use against my fine lines
not only did i experience no improvement from this product
i actually feel like my skin has had a setback from not using my regular treatments
which is my only problem area
i dot notice any visible difference in my skins appearance or texture
have not noticed much of a difference
i did not notice any difference in my skin
i didn't notice any "changes" in my skin
i noticed that it had created a deep wrinkle under one of my eyes
i want to see more apparent results
haven't noticed any improvement in fine lines or sun damage
there has been no change at all
i don't notice any difference in wrinkles either.
my skin wasn't any worse
i noticed no difference in skin texture or tone
i don't doubt the quality of this eye cream
can't comment on crows feet since i am young enough not to be concerned with wrinkles
did not see any improvement in moisture or fine lines
i noticed i was started to get breakouts
i really haven't seen any difference in my skin
no one else complained
by day 2 i started noticing small breakouts
is very noticeable when applied
i am not positive this was the case
it even didn't cause any problems in my eye area
it hasn't helped my lines any
i didn't notice any difference in the way my makeup sat on my skin when applied before makeup nor did i notice any actual difference in the appearance of my under eye area with extended use day
have not seen much of a difference compared to cheaper br
is this to soon to be noticing anything?
i noticed my acnes are appear again
have not been wowed by the results
general appearance of my skin has changed zero
that was all the improvement i saw--in the long run
have not seen much of a difference
i don't notice a dramatic difference with longevity my makeup or smoothness of the base
my biggest complaint about this product is that is made me breakout
gave it almost a full year with no real changes
no less, no more.
i see no difference in the smoothness
there was no difference
haven't seen a difference in fine lines either.
overall i've been very unhappy with this product.
no matter what the residue showed up relentlessly
however i had a similar problem with the white residue
the only problem is a big one
also no dramatic results
instantly the firming/tightening effect was gone
when i added make-up the wrinkles showed
the only time it smoothed my wrinkles was right after i applied it
literally no difference at all
i've seen no improvement in my neck appearance
so does the firming effect
if only there was no white residue
no results on my lines!
perhaps that is the "tightening" effect
i've never experienced a worse breakout
my skincare routine has changed thus my skin has changed
i don't see any improvement on my skin
it actually got worse
did not feel a difference in my overall skin health
on a positive note, it does absorb in quickly.
however i did not notice any long-term or long-lasting affects on my skin
i would go as far as saying that it had a detrimental impact on the quality of my skin
was very displeased with the outcome it had on my skin
i noticed a difference in my skin tone after the first use however
there is no difference in fine lines
i didn't see any improvement in my skin from using it
the only result i notice is my bank account beeing $85 lighter
blemishes have increased though
have seen no results
it has made no difference in my under-eye puffiness
i can’t tell that it has made any difference in my skintone
it hasn’t lessened any of the fine lines that i was hoping it would diminish
there were no visible changes
fine lines were less noticeable
saw no difference at all
i see no difference after using this product
have not noticed a difference.
i don't really see a dramatic difference after using day
i did not notice a difference
i didn't notice any difference with this one.
i used it for a few weeks to no noticeable effect
i saw no difference in puffiness under my eyes nor did i see it brighten under my eyes
seen no change after usage
it has not made a difference for me
i don't notice any difference in the puffiness below my eyes
didn't improve my skin
i think it makes my eye wrinkle s worse
i liked how it brightened my under eye immediately
i don't see much change in my under eye wrinkles.
made any tiny wrinkles i had so much worse
i saw no results.
because my dark circles have seemed to increase terribly
if then there is any improvement
maybe after longer term than a small sample i would see visible results
i used it for a good month before it started to affect my skin negatively
hasn't improved my fine lines
the look of my eyes improved since the beginning
she showed me this product for a new eye cream
however at week 3 i have noticed that my under eye area has become dry
i still had no change in coloration of my dark circles under my eyes which was the thing i was really wanting
the pump alone has caused me issues.
it has not been helping the appearance of fine lines due to aging
since the only benefit i saw
the result is visibly worse
i noticed very little difference in my under eyes
t's more cosmetic than actual skin improvement
i didn't notice any major results as far as reducing fine lines or reducing dark circles
other than the fact that it temporarily brightens because it has a kind of shimmer effect to it
as i see no noticeable changes
the main reason for the lower rating is that the pump stopped working while there was still a significant amount of product inside
my fine lines became more pronounced
i still use the skin brightening serum by caudalie which is remarkable however
there are some pretty signficant flaws in the packaging
it made my pores more noticeable
so far, i'm not seeing any huge difference.
i see no difference in my fine lines
i don't notice it lightening
have not seen any positive changes.
it did not decrease any of the fine lines that are starting to appear
he also raved about its anti-aging/wrinkle fighting properties which i have yet to see
not any less noticeable
didn't see any changes in wrinkles around eyes
didn't do much to diminish fine lines or wrinkles
there was no irritation
it provides a good amount of hydration however there is no difference with the dark circles
noticed that my under eye area was softer
however it did absolutely nothing for dark circles
lately in this long
it has no long lasting effect
the only change i've seen in my skin is that it is softer
in my mind if unhappy with the product
no change in the appearance of my pores.
i don’t see any real improvement with my pores
never noticed any change in pore size
did not notice any refinement of pores
i noticed no improvement in pore size or skin quality
saw no difference in pores.
i think this actually made my pores bigger.
no miracles out there.
really have seen no change in their appearance
i do not have noticeable pores
this product might have made my pores seem slightly less visible when i first put it on
it has no long-term effect
i saw little-no difference
there is virtually no difference
have not seen a difference in the size of my pores
there was absolutely no difference in my pore size-long term or immediately
they are definitely visible
have not seen results
there's been no difference at all in the size of my pores
have not noticed a big difference in the size of my pores
they are still very visible.
with extended use i didn't notice any change in my pores over time
the prior product more or less masked my huge pores
also the effect wasnt that obvious
saw not even the slightest change
i've seen absolutely no change
i've seen a slight improvement on other parts of my face
i didn't see any change in my pore size
i saw no difference in the clearness of my skin or the size of my pores
on the positive side
unfortunately, i saw no long term results.
i saw virtually no improvement
to have a truer test comparison
the only benefit i noticed was that it made my skin very soft
it definitely does not work for firming/tightening
there is no difference in my deeper lines between my eyebrows
saw very poor results
either way i've seen no difference in my skin.
i don't have any age spots to diminish
i didn't notice a big difference in my skin after using the entire bottle
i didn't notice any immediate results
my skin has always been clear
when i've been taking good care of my skin
then use this there's no noticeable difference for me
no real breakouts with this one
ials read others saw no change
i noticed that in general
i see no visible difference in my skin
saw no visible results in my skin
i did not notice an improvement in my skin
no discernible reduction in lines
not only did this product not have any positive impact on my skin
seems to have made some difference in fine lines/wrinkles
haven't seen any real results
have noticed the texture of my skin has improved
i noticed no changes at all except for an increase in clogged pores
the only noticeable difference that it made was that my skin is slightly softer when wearing the serum
no other improvements though
haven't really noticed a difference.
there were no significant warnings about the use of this product by people with oily or sensitive skin
have seen no difference in my skin
have not noticed any results
while i havent experienced any adverse effects
that was about the only positive
i don't think i saw any noticeable changes after using this product
my skin has never been worse.
i did not see noticable anti aging results yet
previous one was light yellow-making me think that is coming from active ingredient
have noticed no difference
had wrinkles i would notice a difference
i think the spf in it was the problem
it was no problem returning
i didn't notice any difference in my dark circles
i didn't see any major difference
i didn't see an improvement with my dark circles
i didnt see any improvement in the appearance of fine lines
saw no real improvements to my under eye area
haven't seen any results
sadly, i've seen no results at all.
unfortunately none of the same results happened
actually no results happened
i saw no effect
i can't say i've seen any changes
it did noting for the crepyness under my eyes
as time has gone by ive noticed more lines forming under my eyes
haven't seen changes but been using it everyday.
did not diminish the appearance of signs of aging around the eyes
after more than a month of use there is no real improvement in either puffiness or dark circles
the first day i saw a huge difference
didn't see any improvement after a week of application
have noticed that my dark circles are the same if not worse
which i have never seen before
see absolutely no difference
did not notice much of a difference
my wrinkles or fine lines are still just as noticeable
i saw no difference in fine lines.
bought one bottle and noticed a huge difference.
this within seconds makes my skin look a few years younger no doubt
it may not be noticeable on pale skin.
haven't noticed any firming/wrinkle reduction
the tightness is gone
i felt it made the deeper wrinkles look more pronounced
it also seemed to make my wrinkles look worse.
i did see a reduction in the bags
i returned it to sephora with no problems.
i did not notice any difference with my pores
then started to enhance my flaws rather than hide them
it went on so much smoother
my skin has definitely gone up a level in softness
removing it is even worse
never achieved the 'rich milk' described- it never lathered
or changed color at all
i did not see any radiant improvement on my skin tho
i noticed that my skin was more oily than ever
every skin is different
it has a slight lightening effect on the skin which is good
actually made my skin more dull after a week
this was a massive disappointment
the scent was more pronounced than i would have liked
this face cream is nothing special in my opinion.
luckily i haven't had that problem
did not notice a difference after using the product
disappointing results, as in no results at all.
i see no difference in dark circles
i noticed no difference
my under eyes have not changed one bit
at least i haven't experienced any bad effects

haven't found one yet that ever has though
i didn't see any of the positive results.
while i didn't have the time to see the brightening effects of this
there has been no difference what so ever
i don't see the situation improving
i start to see an improvement
i don't see any change on my under eye circles
i've not seen any results
no improvements on dark circles
the age arrest eye cream is better than this one.
this is one of the few products from the line that i haven't been wowed by
not 100% sure on the brightening success
another disappointment- in regards to dark circles
it will show some sign of improvement
one positive was that the product has no scent
have seen no improvement at all in lines or dark circles
over with no results
however after a month of daily use of cytocell i haven't seen any difference in the color of the dark circles under my eyes
which is my biggest concern in eye care at this point
i've noticed almost no difference in my under eye circles
i found it no better than any other eye cream
no real brightening or firming.
i didn't see any improvement
no difference in lines or circles
was underwhelmed with the results

i read reviews before buying stating some saw improvements with fine lines
great for people with no major eye area issues

other than this i can't say i've seen drastic changes in my under eye area
although i don't have any under eye problems
i don't really see a noticeable difference in the condition of the skin under
i can't say that there was an appreciable brightening or tightening effect
have noticed any differences in my eye area
nor repairing any subtle lines
le some mild discomfort if i think i look better
it does have some serious brightening agents in it
do not experience any irritation
i've noticed that other reviewers have said the packaging is deceiving
have not seen a significant improvement
don't notice any changes to dark spots or brightness
a half i didn't notice any difference in my skin
have noticed no difference in my skin whatsoever
i noticed the consistency on the top part is very watery
felt like that gave more visible improvements
i did not experience any improvement
but also did not see any improvements on my skin.
this one is a definite skip.
i like this product as i saw it reduced my fine lines
haven't noticed any bad reaction with my bb cream

the cleanser also showed no change in how oily my skin was
i didn't notice any real difference in my skin while using this product
i also didn't notice any positive results
the first time i put this on one of my larger blemishes
it did a great job at diminishing it overnight
haven't seen it happen yet.
when i wake up theres absolutely no difference
had high expectations for this after having heard positive reviews
barely noticed a change in the amount in the bottle
after months of using it as directed on problem spots i saw no significant results
i don't find that it really diminished any blemishes
i didn't notice any improvements at all with using this
this shows no signs of slowing it down
it actually made my skin worst
have not noticed any improvements in my blemishes
the bottle being the smallest thing i've seen in my life
i see no noticeable difference
no increase, but also no decrease.
was utterly disappointed when it hadn't gone down in redness or size
this is the only thing that has changed in my routine
you changed the formula.
i also noticed no difference in my skin using this
no difference in skin texture, etc.

otherwise don't notice a huge difference
although this product seemed average to me
i did not see any difference in regards to its anti-aging claims
there were no improvements.
noticing my skin getting worse with breakouts i didn't have before i returned it
hasn't made my skin worse :
absolutely nothing noticeable happened with my skin
unfortunately it has not minimized the size of my pores in the least
i didn't have any noticeable improvement
i would have stayed matte longer
have not noticed anything incredible in my skin
did not notice any difference
yet this didn't affect the way the mask worked
there was zero change
saw almost no difference
i also didn't realize any of my pores being reduced
i felt like this product made my skin breakout even more
haven't noticed a difference in my pores
hopefully i'll return to for a positive update.
i saw no difference in my pores
has someone seen a difference using the product in the long run?
while i did notice a small difference
left me with no complaints
my only concern is fine lines
i never this problem with my previous product.
neutrals: as i didn't have noticeable lines around my eyes i can't comment on its ability to minimize lines
haven't seen any differences in dark circles
not only did i have zero negative reactions
i gave only 3 stars because i didnt see any difference
the product really does nothing to improve the under eye area
my undereye is not worse than the past
exacerbated any wrinkles after using for about one week
i do not see any improvement to my under eye dark circles
however i haven't noticed any difference in my fine lines or dark circles
i wanted to minimize the damage being done to my skin
it increased the amount of acne i had originally had
this worsened both of those things.
it does not change my oil condition
i did not notice any diminished pores
since i still breakout
didn't see an obvious effect
all have been a disappointment
no other change in my skin care routine
saw absolutely no difference
overall not a bad mask
this one is much worse than overnight version.
there is a difference between feeling mositerized
did not notice significant improvement
had the same feeling
my skin reacted very poorly
i left a glowing review previously
i don't see any noticeable changes on my face
i saw no difference before
didn't notice any major changes.
didn't notice huge skin benefits
or any improvements at all
definite a miss for me.
it did not really impact my blemishes that much
didn't see a significant effect on my skin
it made it worse
i didn't really notice a reduction in oil the next day
needed something to clear up a recent breakout from stress
have not seen any results
unfortunately haven't seen remarkable results
this one doesn't seem to improve my skin condition at all
i saw zero difference although it does feel refreshing
that one shrunk my pores the very first time i used it
no noticeable results otherwise!
did not notice any "clarifying" properties while using it
did not notice any overall skin improvement
like the clinique dramatically different
i started to notice that with the use of other products that my skin was finally getting brighter
has a slight brightening effect on my skin
because of the grey tint as others have mentioned
the few breakouts i had got worse by then.
it only got worse
it definitely has a cooling effect
i didn't notice any brightening effects
didn't notice any improvement
it doesn't have any visible effects
there are better eye creams out there in my opinion
now i'm having a bit of discomfort
didn't make a differnce in the eye area
making wrinkles actually more noticeable
there has been no improvements in regards to tightness
just visibly reducing wrinkles for a few hours would have made it worth it
yet to see any changes
no difference in my 37 year old skin
i saw absolutely no difference in my skin
all the serums i have used in the past have had at least one positive effect on my skin
this yielded no results whatsoever
however, i no longer perceive the same effects.
not see much improvement of lightening skin tone
have been experiencing quite a bit of flakiness
i didn't notice any difference
what a disappointment with this one.
the packaging however is a big disappointment.
for the price i was expecting more noticeable results
can't say i've noticed anything significant.
i havn't noticed any change in fine lines which was what i was mainly hoping for
appreciated the no hassle return
i didn't feel there was a change in my skin
quickly absorbscons: did not really notice much of a difference in my skin
i noticed no difference in skin
even though i experienced no benefits from it
after to try to see if there was any objective evidence of improvement
lower may have marginally improved
or at least somewhat noticeable ones
i felt the tightening that is mentioned
i saw zero change with regards to dark circles
my main problem area
i found that result strange
have seen no difference in my upper eyelid
no diminishing of the slight crepe texture around the upper lid nor any noticeable overall firming or lifting effect
noticed an immediate difference
i didn't notice any dramatic results on my upper lids
didn't notice any difference.
i didn't see any immediate impact
i saw no visible difference
i see a slight tightening effect
i don't see an improvement
have not seen any results
so far neither of us have noticed any real change in our eyelids
saw no difference at all
i didn't see a marked improvement in my skin after about 2 weeks use
no decreasing of fine lines
especially with no results
no major improvements seen.
i see no change in my skin
she hasn't seen any improvement with it
overall i liked the warming sensation
i saw no reduction in pore size or improvement in breakouts
after using it 3 times i didn't really notice a difference in my skin
haven't noticed any difference with my skin also the texture is different
i noticed no changes even weeks after using this:
i've never experienced this before in my life
saw no difference in my skin
there were no noticeable differences in my skin
i saw no change in my skin
that everyone started noticing the difference in her skin
i don't see any sign of firming
i see absolutely no improvement in my skin
that cream makes an instantaneous visible difference
the effect is progressively less interesting after that
hence the lines are less visible
we both had a bad skin reaction to the product
i did notice a slight plump effect
there are no visible signs that i've switched moisturizers
have not seen any changes in my skin at all
havent noticed much of a difference in the firming
think it might have created some blemishes
noticeable i just wanted to give my skin a boost
i still have visible lines
well, this only made it worse!
it made my under-eye lines more noticeable
i don't see any difference whatsoever to my under eye area
didn't notice change in dark circles
have yet to see any improvement under my eyes where ihave wrinkles
i am glad others have seen improvements
it seemed to make matters worse
i don't see any improvement to my disappointment
no change in tightening the skin under my eyes.
i saw a difference in 10 days like the outlined results say
no noticeable change in appearance of my eye lids or the area under my eye
i saw no tightening effect.
so far haven't noticed a big difference in the skin around the eyes
i've never had that problem before
after four uses i have seen a significant rise in breakouts as well as more oil in my t zone
it made it worse
the oil became very noticeable
this, in fact, made my oiliness a bit worse.
i didn't notice any change in my pores or skin condition
there just isn't a noticeable difference to continue to pay this much for an average product
it did give me a pretty noticeable chilling/burning sensation
it was such a disappointment
that was my first impression
i noticed a difference in 4 uses !
i didn't notice that it brightened my skin
did not see any changes in my skin.
i didn't see any "brightening" after almost a month's use
expecting the same results
didn't notice a difference with my skin
i sadly saw no results
i also did not see much difference in lightening my dark spots from blemishes
it has also brightened my face a little
i noticed no difference in brightening or complexion
the only thing is i havint really noticed a brightening effect on my skin
to see if it was just a fluke
able to use this mask as an eye cream with no adverse reaction
my skin is not any brighter nor any less dull
it has actually helped clear up some acne problems he had been having
didnt notice any dramatic brightness or changes
maybe there was a good reason for the change
it also made my vision blurry for longer than normal
maybe i have a defect
haven't noticed any difference in my skin at all
feel no difference in my skin when using this product
i don't see any change in my skin whatsoever
my wrinkles have actually become deeper
saw absolutely no results
i really expected to see some sign of positive improvement in skin tone or brightness after two uses
i also didn't notice any of plumping effects that have been talked about
since it hasn't caused any adverse effects on my sensitive skin i'm going to keep at it until the bottle is empty
that must all happen within the blink of an eye since there isn't much of a delay between the spraying
didn't see any changes to my skin
i also did not notice a difference in moisture.
nor do i notice any firming of my skin
i am waiting for positive results
makes no difference on your face.
there simply s no appreciable difference
i've not see any reduction in lines or immediate results on anything
no difference what so ever in my skin.
using this twice a day isn't happening for me due to the texture of the product
the effect it has on my skin
have not seen any difference
saw nothing improved around my mouth
no change in my deep wrinkles or expression lines
no lines have lessened
there was minimal improvement to my dry skin.
haven't seen much improvement
i did not notice any change for the better or worse
reading other peoples reviews about the smell made me realized that i wasn't the only one
the first thing i noticed was that it seems strange
i exchanged it for the sheer transformation
i saw no brightening effect
didn't see improvement on my skin.
however this worsened with my oiliness as the day progressed
this hasn't made a difference for me at all.
i notice a reduction in break-outs when i use it regularly
it did make a difference in the amount of oil on my skin
i see no difference.
i saw no difference with pore appearance
didn't see/notice any difference in my skin
although it felt light
do feel like my dark circles have improved
does have a cooling effect for the under eye
it really hasn't had any noticeable effect on that at all
i didn't see a considerable difference
i liked the cooling effect.
said to say there is no change.
only problem i found
i did not see a noticeable difference in my under eye puffyness
i did not notice any improvement in my skin around the eyes
still not a huge difference.
i feel a difference in the skin around my eyes
it is not drastic or great
had a nice cooling effect at first
this hasn't caused any negative reactions
unfortunately does not give substantial de-puffing results
this product had no affect on the bags under my eyes
visually there was no improvement
it always caused a reaction on my fair skin
i've noticed that my t-zone has been more oily than normal
i saw some changes however it made me break out more on my cheeks
i only noticed a minimal difference in my dark circles
i changed my face
i would have liked it to provide more noticeable results
by the time i finished the jar i wasn't seeing any exceptional results
i do agree with the previous reviewer who stated that applying extra on problem spots alleviated their appearance
plus it did nothing to battle my first signs of aging
i notice a slight improvement the next morning
i see no signs of real improvement in my skin
i did not see a remarkable difference after using it
i didn't notice any difference.
did not notice any changes in my skin tone
but never saw a difference.
i didn't notice a considerable difference
haven't seen a huge improvement after 2 weeks of use
the areas that have improved have not been the driest parts of my face
nothing about my skin has changed
if anything my skin has seen better days.
it to see immediate results
there is no evidence of it actually absorbing into my skin
noticed a slight difference in the lines around my eyes
i saw absolutely no improvement.
my skin has been stressed out lately
i can't say that i noticed a difference in my skin
i can say that it caused no irritation
i didn't see any major good changes in my skin
the situation continued to deteriorate
i saw no results with the exception of the bumps that came
i literally saw no difference
that being said tidal faded them even better
can't say i noticed a whole lot as far as improvement on wrinkles or pores goes
made our skin worse than before
after using it once i noticed that my skin had a slight break out
after using it i noticed my pores looked the same
i saw a slight increase in breakouts
this didn't improve my skin or make it worse
i honestly saw no difference in my skin.
didn't really notice a difference in my skin or pore size either
i also didn't notice a difference in pore size.
both caused my face to breakout like no other.
once i stopped using this product i noticed a change immediately in how clean my skin felt
it is now march, & i have seen no difference.
it didn't make a noticeable difference on my skin
see no improvement in my skin at all
haven't noticed a difference in my skin
haven't noticed a difference in my skin
i didn't notice any major improvements in skin
haven't gotten great results
i see absolutely no difference
i've had to change up my routine
which definitely has improved the look of my skin
used it without hesitation
i also did not notice any significant changes in my skin tone
after that the oily consistency is not noticeable
haven't really noticed any change in my skin
very very slight improvement in fine lines
have not noticed any major results
the fact that i had no adverse reactions to it
i saw absolutely no difference what so ever in my skin
this is a deep wrinkle minimized which did
i saw absolutely no change after i applied this.
saw no difference at all
there was no improvement
that has reduced the appearance of fine lines by my eyes
i noticed when i applied makeup to the same area under my eyes
saw no results at all
would like to see some difference
didn't notice any change in lines or decreasing of anything
have not noticed any real difference
while i see a little improvement
i didn't see any improvement after a month of use
it also made me very patchy
it actually made it worse.
my face has really changed since using this product
i've never had a reaction like this before
haven't seen an improvement in my skin
i never felt any improvement
didn't notice a change at all!
not only has it made the situation worse
sad they changed the formula.
this product hasn't done anything to the few blemishes i have
i've noticed that combined with other face products
no positive results at all
also my pores have not been clearer since using!
my skin has never looked this bad.
i did not notice a single difference after using this eye mask
i didn't visually notice a difference in my eyes
there was no clear effect
i didn't notice much improvement after either use
i noticed little improvement in my skin
this one was a disappointment
after using the mask, the sag was not noticeable.
i noticed no difference in the appearance of my eye area
no effect whatsoever when i removed
marks are still there
it absolutely made no difference for me
no improvement in dark spots or skin texture either
it did not improve my skin tone
actual big zits that i haven't seen in over a year
that should of triggered my suspicions because wrinkle serums almost never come in this amount
my face still hasn't shown any improvements
no difference is my skin whatsoever
there was a huge difference between using it vs
in fact, it made mine worse.
didn't see a difference in my skin
noticed a difference within a week of use.
i still had a lot of embarassing breakout periods
have seen little to no improvement on my skin
i will say that i have noticed that my skin has softened up
haven't seen any difference
my foundation has never looked worse.
i saw no difference
still the same problem
there were no discernible results
i don't see that my dark spots have been diminished or anything
maybe i'll see more progress after the 2nd tube.
this was a huge disappointment.
in fact this was the first time that i was bothered
have noticed no difference
i didn't see or felt any changes in my skin
for the price i'd like to notice some sort of difference
though i was surprised at first
the results not that obvious
i didn't notice any difference in the look of my skin at all
had a minimal effect on my skin
there is no actual effect
didn't notice much of a difference in my skin.
i didn't notice that using this mask made any significant difference to my skin
i notice no difference in my skin
my face has never been this dry.
that the greasy film was more noticeable
i found that the "intense"
i knew it had to be this moisturizer because i hadn't changed anything in my skin care routine
so this was a surprise
saw no long term effect
have not seen any difference at all
i never really noticed a difference in my dark circles
it changed nothing about my dark circles
however there isn't much results from the product itself regarding darkness or brighten
this product seemed to make my dark circles more noticeable
just today i realized that the one change i have made was to stop using the dark circle corrector
there wasn't a drastic improvement
my eyes have been looking worse since starting use of this cream
i don't notice a significant difference in reducing the dark circles
i did find an improvement in the appearance of skin under my eyes
haven't seen any results
i didn't see a difference in color at all
i felt like it made my fine lines more obvious
have yet to see any improvement for dark circles
although i have not seen noticeable improvement in my dark circles
i ve never had real problems with dark circles
haven't noticed any difference under my eyes
i see no improvement whatsoever in my dark under eye circles
i wanted to post a review that raved about how it lightened my dark circles by at least 30%
just hasn't been effective
see if the improvement continues
i can see a very slight improvement
which i have never experienced in an eye cream
i saw no change
i also see no differences in the dark areas under my eyes
i tried product for several weeks with no improvement whatsoever
not noticable change in dark circles
overall i can see no improvement after several weeks of use
there was no difference.
no results seen yet as far as correcting my dark under eye area
have seen no improvement in my dark circles
i deduced that it was this product
as nothing else in my routine had changed
this is the second clinique eye product i have used that has caused a reaction of some sort
30% improvement is already not much to brag about
have seen absolutely no difference
i noticed no other beneficial reasons to continue using it
i didn't notice any improvement in my skin
i truly notice no difference
i've seen a lot of people talking about a formula change
i compared the two on my skin
soothed the breakout that i had gotten
made the major breakout disappear
without any noticeable difference
i don't see any real changes to the texture of my skin when using this
i saw no other benefits
it continued to become worse
i've used a whole bottle in 3 months without seeing a single difference in my skin
no noticeable change whatsoever so i returned it.
not seeing any reduction
if i notice a change in skin, i will update.
i've finished the bottle with no noticeable results
i still didn't see any improvements in discoloration or even texture
it literally made no difference whatsoever.
i don't notice any result
i do not see a difference in my dark spots nor is my skin any brighter
in that time i have not seen any improvement.
they were mostly positive
haven't seen any results.
it hasn't helped much
so far, i haven't noticed any difference.
i don't see any improvement on my skin's texture or fine lines
skin began to look a little bit better after 1st usage
i've noticed a reduction in oiliness, however.
this product actually made my breakouts worse!
it is definitely helping reduce the amount of oiliness on my face overall though out the day
thanks but no thanks.
this product was no different
haven't actually seen an improvement yet
have noticed no results
has helped improve my skin's appearance
it has done nothing at all in terms of clarifying
it may have been a bad coincidence
i didn't notice any other changes in my skin
the biggest negative for me
most regretted purchase i've ever made.
no idea if that was a factor
have to say it is a big disappointment
saw no improvement or difference in my skin
for me no results has been seen
i saw no difference
it didn't change the texture
this is no exception
also to top it off this time i haven't seen the same dramatic toning effects or noticed good quality like before
didn't see any improvement at all.
although i could see some changes in my skin texture
the only other drawback for me was that it hasn't really brightened my skin
i seem to have gotten some minimal brightening from use
i saw virtually zero results for my $85
i saw no improvement
i didnt see any changes to my skin
i saw no other benefits.
although i haven't experienced that much before
did not see any difference in terms of my dark eye circles
there is no difference
the brightening effect is purely superficial
have seen no improvement
the results were great on my skin
i still have yet to see a difference
had the same result
i noticed a very very slight difference.
did not notice any differences
in addition i have not noticed a difference overall in the appearance of my dark circles
it definitely did not diminish the appearance of my dark circles
he didn't see any difference so exchanged it for another eye cream
very slight improvement after 1 month
have noticed no difference in the brightness of my under eye area
i didn't really see any improvement in my eyes
any visible differences after a week of applying.
while she did notice some pretty immediate tightening results
i didn't notice any improvement in my skin with use
has caused my skin to break out worse than usual
has no effect on toning
from the signs of it
i didn't notice my skin get any brightening effect
glow that i experienced when using this
didn't see any brightening.
he seldom notices anything
so far it has improved the firmness in my skin
have noticed more results with that than this
it has dramatically improved my skin
this product changed my skin instantly
noticed after the third week of using this product that it has caused my skin to develop blemishes
did not notice any improvement
it didn't notice much change on my pore size
have not seen my skin break out so much in years
after using this product for over a month now i barely saw some reduction in oiliness if even that
no change in my pore size
i didn't notice a different in firmness either
have not seen any noticeable reduction in the size of my pores
alone i can't say i've seen much of a difference in my skin since i started using it
definitely does not have any visible effects
the peeling was so noticeable people were commenting on it
i thouught it should have a more pronounced effect
i hardly notice it.
haven't noticed any difference
i saw little to no results
i don't see much of a difference since the first time i started
the formula had possibly been changed
i saw no change- my skin was not 'brighter'
i didn't even see a glimpse of improvement in the skin around my eyes
overall, this product was a big disappointment.
no change, no difference, nada!
unfortunately there are no models on the video with as much under eye puffiness as i have
wouldn't flaunt that i saw any significant results
i saw no change.
additionally, i saw no results.
with some slight loss of elasticity
i believe this has been the biggest disappointment of a product ever
it caused me more problems
used up a full bottle -applied 2 times a day- with not even a single visible improvement
also made it worse
i saw no difference in using it
the consistency was thinner than i initially expected
overall i noticed absolutely no change in the condition or appearance of my skin over approximately 6 weeks
it did not brighten my skin as claimed
i expected to see some brightening
didn't see any improvements
i also didn't notice any changes in my skin.
overall i think there was some improvement
while i did notice a slight difference in the skin on my forehead
my 3 star rating reflects my satisfaction with the slight difference
however there were some unintended side effects.
both instances i had the same feeling of sticky skin
as the adverse side effects i don't like are nothing when i'm sleeping
no major complaints other than the price.
it doesn't plump up my skin or provide any particular glow or noticeable effect
better for summer given its very light consistency
there are less expensive moisturizers i've tried that have provided a lot more noticeable effect
i saw zero improvement on texture or condition of my skin
i didn't notice any skin improvement for using it
my skin feels very nice after using it to wash however i have noticed an increase in small blemishes while using it
there is no noticeable scent, which is great.
that my skin no longer has that tight
she found the consistency
i unfortunately did not see the benefit of diminished fine lines
since this was the only change in my routine
still hasn't gone back to normal
with no noticeable changes in my skin
since it isn't having any negative effects
i wish i could say that i've seen a difference in the lines on my forehead
i don't see much difference in the appearance of my fine lines or skin texture
i really wish that i saw a difference in my mid 30s wrinkles
my fine lines are slightly less noticeable.
haven't noticed any substantial changed in my skin texture or tone
i'll give it another month so see if i notice any changes
have not yet seen the desired results
have seen some results
i can see the changes in my skin
i can't really say that i've seen any result i diminishing any fine lines or wrinkles
have not seen any change after one month
have checked for results
ever since using it my dark circles have become more pronounced
firming" improvement as it claims to do
disappointed to say it hasn't really done much these last couple of months for me in terms of decreasing fine lines
didn't cause any irritation so those are the only positives
i did not notice any brightening or anti-aging effects
i still had to return it because of the bizarre wrinkles appearing
haven't seen any difference
had no issues with any allergic reaction
after a month of usage i did not see any changes.
the dark circles that had been there were diminished
i saw absolutely no difference.
even a small change would have been nice
really didn't see any changes in the puffiness
the sales person swore i would see dramatic reduction in puffiness in a week or so
it's not worth the discomfort in my opinion
i really haven't noticed a difference
it didn't minimize my blemish or make any difference whatsoever
clearly indicating that this mask irritated my skin
this was definitely the worst mask ever
despite the tingly feeling i didn't notice any improvement in my breakouts
didn't really notice much of a difference in my face
i also didn't notice a difference in terms of my blemishes
there's no difference before and after.
i stopped using it and my skin is a lot calmer.
my skin had no issues with absorbing it
on the positive side
i noticed the product was not oil free
nothing has reduced excess oil on my face like this
everywhere i had applied it
didn't notice any difference in my skin
i saw no noticeable difference in the condition of my skin after using this oil for a month
does not help decrease cakeyness
no difference at all noticed.
so no improvement in my crow's feet
i never really notice a difference
i didn't really see any change in my fine lines or puffiness
i don't feel like they have been brightened at all
haven't notice any difference yet
this is without a doubt
this product didn't do much positively or negatively
i did notice a difference the first few times i used it
i've gone my entire life without breakouts
it has a nice consistency however i haven't seen any wow effect
didn't notice any benefits
have not seen even a slight change
since i have seen that slight result
i see no difference in my lines at all
there has been zero change in any of my fine lines
i didn't notice any difference
it has noticibly improved the skin on my declotage
this morning i could see a visible reduction in my "elevens"
never saw any improvement :
i saw no change whatsoever.
can see improvement there
i don't notice any other improvement to my lines
haven't noticed any improvements
we though it made them noticeably darker
i see no results
i really didn't notice any change in my skin.
if i noticed a difference
which has never felt nicer
have noticed absolutely no positive differences
have never had a problem
haven't seen any changes :/
while i didn't experience the irritation that others did
had the same horrible result every time
i didn't really notice a difference except it burned
puffiness that was worse than i originally had
really haven't seen much of a difference in the fine lines around my eyes
i did notice that it softened the skin under my eyes
a good deep hydration eye cream would have a better effect at a much lower price
i did not really notice any improvement with this product over a week
after 2 months there was no visible difference at all in my eye area
my experience with this product has been very negative
it hasn't done anything to improve my eyes.
it dried my skin out so much that wrinkles that had never been there before became huge creases
at first this serum seemed to be fading my scars at an accelerated rate
over time i saw little to no change
my scars have not changed at all
i didn't notice any difference in my face
not even the most minuscule of a difference.
there are absolutely no changes
on the positive side i have noticed improvement of some older red marks/ scars
as another reviewer mentioned i also have noticed this cream contri
no change at all.
after 2-3 months of absolutely no change i discontinued noticing that i was developing even worse acne in the areas that i applied it to
night for a few weeks with no change whatsoever
update if there's a change
made it more visible
haven't seen any improvement more than a lighter skin in general
i've noticed no difference in my scarring
i never see my scar has some change
they said scar thickness was significantly decreased in four weeks:
i feel it has helped soften any previous scars
haven't seen any reduction the appearance of my blemishes
the rep told me after 2 weeks of using it i would see a huge difference in my acne scaring
saw little to no improvement
my scars aren't too big, but they are noticeable.
i don't see any improvement.
i didn't see any improvement
i think it has slightly improved the appearance of my acne scars i haven't seen a drastic improvement
it hasn't caused me to breakout
at first i noticed some pretty nice improvements
so far the results of them diminishing hasn't been dramatic
at first this item seems to diminish my pores
i notice my pores haven't change
it made it so much worse
this is my first reaction to a cream like this
it hasn't been for me
it's also made no difference in the appearance of my pores
i don't see any difference in my pores or any significant brightness in my skin
no change in my skin.
i didn't see any difference in my pores
until results are seen
there is no positive change
haven't noticed any difference in my pores
i did not experience any positive benefits to my skin at all
i don't see any improvement of my pores
it have been disappointed
zilch to shrink my piers' visibility
i don't notice any difference in my pore size
i did not noticed any results
i didn't see a difference in my pores
i didn´t notice any change or improvement in my skin
haven't noticed any pore-minimizing results
i've seen absolutely no results from using this.
did not discern any noticeable differences in my skin
this one seemed lacking
i did notice more firmness
there is not any kind of lasting effect that i have noticed
have not noticed a difference at all
see no difference in my pores
i never once saw improvements let alone life altering changes in the darkness under my eyes
i saw no improvement after using the entire bottle
haven't noticed any difference in my dark circles or fine lines
in the beginning there might have been a slight reduction in dark circles
perhaps it improved my under eye
not something i noticed
i've literally seen no difference
saw no improvement in my skin at all
in fact it made my under eye area look much worse
noticed an almost immediate improvement
used the whole bottle without any improvement
i don't see any other improvements
i need something to improve the condition of my under eyes
this had the reverse effect for me
this one had an impact
i'll update the progress later
as far as helping improve my fine lines there has been no change whatsoever
i saw no results.
i didn't see any major improvements in any of those issues
saw no difference at all
when i first reviewed this product i wasn't noticing any benefits
i also wasn't noticing any negative effects
there were no visible differences before
was surprised to see that it is a "solution" for wrinkles
there may be a slight improvement in wrinkles
i don't notice any change to my dark circles
i've noticed absolutely no changes
have seen zero results.
i did notice slight brightening
it's a miracle to have noticed any difference at all
after using the whole pot did not see any brightening effect at all
i didn't notice any difference in my under eyes
fine lines it was very minimal
i wasn't expecting a drastic change or a miracle
i feel like my under eye circles have actually gotten better
i saw no difference.
since my dark circles have been getting worse
can't say i had any improvements
there was very little difference in my under eye area
i really haven't noticed any difference in the brightening department
i didn't notice any differences around my eyes
absolutely no improvement at all
unfortunately, i saw no difference.
i don't see any firming or brightening
i didn't notice drastic improvements in my undereye circles
the only positive comment i have to say is that your eyes feel fresh after application
it had absolutely no affect whatsoever on my dark circles
there was no brightening affect al
there wasn't any noticeable improvement in my dark circles or lines
unfortunately i haven't really noticed any improvement when it comes to the dark circles under my eyes
neither has made a difference in brightening the skin
i saw no change from this product
i saw no change in the appearance of dark circles in my under eye area
this made no difference
i did not find that my eye area was brightened or anything
have not seen any brightness under my eye area
i kept using it though because i noticed that it did help a pimple i had starting to form
did not notice any improvement on my skin.
the smell is stronger than what a expected
i am not seeing a big difference overall to my skin mainly my eyes where i put it
the problem seemed to be corrected
i did not see such improvement
have commented on it
have only begun to see fine line formation
i've not noticed any improvement
no noticeable difference either.
after using it one week i noticed some wrinkles
no change in my skin at all
maybe i am still too young for it to have any noticeable affects
has not made one bit of difference though used as recommended
i do notice that the little crows feet i have are less noticeable
in terms of hydration there was no noticeable difference
it was so bad i almost thought it was an alergic reaction
has not made me eye situation worse
havent seen a big change
i didn't see a change in softness
can't see a dramatic difference
had an immediate reaction
there isn't any difference in my skin
i can't feel a difference between this mask
way smaller than i imagined.
the first thing i noticed was that it was very silky going on
not much improvement on pore tightening part
it has the consistency
although my skin is now clear
there was absolutely no visual difference
i didn't have any bumps in particular
the second day actual blemishes started to form
despite the good reviews i read prior to purchasing the nars mask i was not impressed
i saw no difference in my skin
more than 2drop is nightmare
i saw no benefits out of this serum unfortunately
i did not notice a difference in my skin when i added this serum to my beauty routine
it did not work for me in that aspect as i did not notice any improvement of the redness in my face
i saw no results
i never had so much breakouts
the only thing i appreciated was the consistency of the foam
nothing has happened to my skin
i found i wasn't really seeing any dramatic results in my skin
my concern is premature fine lines
i saw no difference around my eye area
despite the obvious irritation
only made it worst
has a great smell however i felt it caused my skin to breakout completely
i didn't see much color as a result on my face
unfortunately i haven't noticed the same effect even once
guess it affects different skin types/tones differently
the "glow" is not perceptible.
but overall i didn't see results.
so while i have noticed a difference i don't think the price
another big problem i have
they better make a difference
i've experienced much better wear
there is no noticeable scent.
this actually made my skin worse
i don't really notice any big difference in my pores
no improvement with pores.
no improvement with lasting makeup.
you can feel the firming effect
didn't really see any noticeable changes
found no change in my sking
however, i was not that impressed with this one.
it absolutely did nothing for firming
the firming effect is not bad
diminished fine lines -- not dramatic results
i really haven't seen any results yet.
i saw no change in pore appearance.
i never saw a difference in my skin
expected more improvement in the powerful anti aging benefits described--not really any difference in about 4 weeks
tried it for months- saw no difference whatsoever
it did nothing to improve any fine lines or wrinkles
i felt nor noticed any change
i never had a problem with breakout before
my skin was clear, not now.
no difference at all
the next day how visibly brighter it was
difference that others have mentioned
like there was a very noticeable difference in my skin
there is nothing advanced about this night cream.
it didn't have any positive or negative effects.
did not notice any difference in my skin at all
i find it not noticeable
it has been shown to increase cell death
it didn't seem to have any positive effect on my skin at all
the only thing i noticed was that
there was no difference in my skin
realized my oil was no longer potent
i did not see a noticeable difference in my skin
i don't notice any great improvement or benefit from using it
that radiant effect is no longer there
they totally changed the ingredients for the worse
5 months withouth seeing any improvements
showed better results on my skin
the changes were visible after two applications.
why my acne has gotten so much worse
i guess that is what was causing the irritation
it hasn't hurt my skin either.
consistency are not bothersome to me
see no difference in my skin whatsoever
i felt it was a little heavy for my preference
to see if i changed my mind
i did not notice any discernible improvement in my skin
i saw absolutely no difference in my skin.
have noticed a slight improvement in my overall skin appearance
my skin improvements are not as noticeable as other products that i have tried in the past
i didn't notice much of a difference
this is the only change in skin care routine i've made
there hasnt been much of a big difference
i noticed no difference.
the good news: my skin did look much improved.
after 2 months i didn't see any difference in my skin
i did not notice any effects with smoothing out fine lines or making my skin look more even
the lower eye cream is nothing special in any way
this product did not change the texture at all
i did not notice any signs of tightening visually after a month of using it
the results were disastrous
saw the same result
doesn't leave any visual or tangible residue.
i noticed that it actually worsened the appearance of my skin
thankfully it was temporary
i see a small difference in that my skin looks healthier
my skin's texture has not improved at all
did not notice any differences in my skin after using a whole jar
i really didnt see a difference in my skin
i looked for any progress, but there was none.
noticed no difference whatsoever in the appearance of my skin
didn't notice a big difference
this was nothing compared to a peel.
i did notice that my skin was cleaner.
this has completely changed my mind.
is quite noticeable after application
my fine lines were more visible after using also.
i see no improvement at all
i can't recommend since i haven't noticed any results
my skin did not improved
i noticed that by pumping 5-6 times i had made a huge dent in the bottle
haven't seen a difference at all
an absence of "wow" factor
it also did nothing to improve my skin
since it has no chemicals in it
i noticed zero skin improvement except both times i have tried to make it part of my regime i have ended up with acne which i never get otherwise
i assumed it would be spectacular
i feel as though it has made my fine lines worse since i started using it
i didn't notice a clear difference before
been using it for two weeks now with no noticeable change except for the new blackheads i received
it does little to nothing to "depuff" my gaining eyes
there is not a noticeable difference
there was nothing distinct about it.
neither did i notice any illuminating effects.
i didn't see clear brighten effect.
it left no results in terms of brightening which was my main concern
i didn't notice any difference/improvement
t's old enough or been in light enough to change color
this was a major disappointment.2.
there has been no noticeable change in skin tone or texture
i now have six huge blemishes
i saw great results with wrinkle reduction
i find almost no difference
while my skin did look good i didn't see such an immense difference to justify the small amount
no other skin concerns
there is a slight positive change to my skin texture
although i did notice my facial lines were softened
it sort of plateaued by the end of the bottle
have had no changes
see improvement in softness
i noticed some texture in the areas
haven't seen any difference so far
i noticed recently that i've been getting black heads in that area
to say this made no difference
ard eye cream i was using before would definitely show some improvement
haven't noticed any difference
i guess there is a placebo effect of feeling proactive about my eye area
have not noticed a difference
it actually made all of my eye issues worse
see no improvement in my fine lines
it almost made it looks worse
no other skin concerns
there is a slight positive change to my skin texture
no difference in discoloration that i have at the corner of my eye
i honestly have yet to see any noticeable results from this eye cream
i don't physically see any improvements regarding fine lines
it seems like it stops making any progress after a certain point
given the glowing reviews i have seen
i did not see any visible changes around my eyes after using it for about a month
there is no difference whatsoever in any aspect of my aging eye area
in fact, i have noticed some new fine lines!
seen 0 changes in my under eye circles
i did not notice any major or slight difference in my eye area
i see no difference with dark circles
the only positives i found were that it absorbed pretty quickly without a greasy feeling
no other skin concerns
there is a slight positive change to my skin texture
i didn't see a difference in my eyes
there were no improvements
i wanted to try something different since my face has been clear lately
this made it worse
i didn't notice a change
after 2 uses i noticed a small area of irritation
my skin hasn't changed any since using it either
gave me the exact same effects
i've had much better results with the black tea
i noticed it was more oily than usual
i looked quite a bit younger than my age before i started this product
dramatically different does not work for my combination skin
while i haven't experienced any negative side effects
i recently moved to a much drier climate
off for years without realizing that it was the cause of my breakouts
as far as i noticed
i switched over to this eye cream because it had a lot of great reviews
the only result i've had with this product is red
i saw no difference at all even in the time that i used it
i think my eyes look worse in the morning
i unfortunately didn't notice any differences after using it
i felt like my dark circles didn't change
i see no differences
my skin hasn't been this slick since high school.
as i kept using it the results start to decrease as in my skin did not improve
my skin has not improved at all
overall it felt heavy
it is definitely noticeable
more i used this the more i noticed my skin getting rougher
i could not get over the strong fragrance that never dissipated
i noticed a drastic increase in small bumps
there is also nothing that would affect visible pores like they claim
night for months with no significant difference in my skin tone
saw absolutely no difference in my complexion
it hasn't "corrected" anything
i didn't notice any such effect
haven't noticed anything different
i read a lot of previous review
there was noticeable shine on my t-zone.
i felt like the product was poorly absorbed in my skin
saw no improvement in my skin it actually got worse
my skin would improve
no improvement i gave up
unfortunately i didn't see improvement in my skin
i didn't see any improvement
the texture of my skin changed for the worse
they did improve my skin texture which has been damaged due to picking
my skin just got progressively worse the longer i used it
there was no improvement or clarity
with no lasting negative effects
i couldn't see any measurable positive results either
hardly noticed a change in my face
my verdict is: i see no difference in my skin whatsoever
no difference at all!!
my first impressions of this serum was that it really absorbed very quickly
found that it hasn't
beyond the terrible smell that many reviewers have already noted
too many steps to follow without any real notable or amazing results
it also did nothing to the blemish
may have even caused a slight break out
i see no difference between normal
my skin was clear prior to using this product
makes my fine lines seem more noticeable
not convinced there would have been a change in my skin at the end of 12 weeks as i didn't see any positive results in the first 3??????
quite the opposite happened
this is just a first impressions
i didn't notice any difference
it hasn't effected them yet
maybe i have to use the whole product line to see major changes
yet no noticeable effects like my other more affordable cream
noticed some changes on my skin
fine lines with some pores that have become more noticeable recently
after a few weeks i have noticed no change.
with no reaction whatsoever).
did not diminish dark circles as stated
i noticed great results with this eye cream as prior i was having a lot of issues with my concealer sinking into fine lines
this definitely diminished this effect
i don't see any noticeable difference though.
i didn't really notice any anti-aging effects
i didn't notice any visible reduction in elasticity
not only did this product not reduce the appearance of my dark spots
it did not reduce the imperfections on my face
very disappointed with the result.
i found that it irritated my skin more than anything
didn't notice any change in my skin tone
any effect this had on my hyper-pigmentation was negligible
which hadn't been a regular problem
i did see an improvement in my skin tone
i found no lightening effect what-so-ever
have not seen any difference in my skin
the dark spot correcting did not happen
i saw marked improvement in one large sun spot on my face
some improvement in a few smaller marks too
there has been no improvement whatsoever
now i am stuck with this $100 product that has not had any impact since
this product made my face breakout.
what made it worse was
could truly assess any changes —
all it did was temporarily increase my glow
it did nothing to improve my skin tone
absolutely no improvement in dark spots.
i didn't see any improvements in these areas
for lack of a better word
i don't notice much of a difference
so far i'm not impressed with the dark spot correcting aspect of the product
however i haven't seen any observable differences in my skin
so far there has been absolutely no difference in my hyperpigmentation
haven't seen a change at all
there is no result after using this mask.
i really haven't seen any difference in this product than any other night creme
i expected more noticeable results for the money
i didn't notice a large difference in comparison to some of the other products i've used
however when i use the mask i don't notice any difference
it has a nice cooling effect on the skin
i didn't notice any real difference after washing it off
given the lack of results
my skin didn't improve
saw/felt no noticeable increase in hydration
haven't noticed any difference in my skin
haven't noticed any long lasting results
regretted that decision because this mask didn't yield any results
so the cooling/soothing effect is short lived
no miracle results here.
overnight gives a much better result.
i don't think this has improved my skin at all.
have not noticed a real difference
the first couple of days i thought the texture of my face was improving
as the days progressed i noticed my face looking duller
it really had no effect on my skin
went with the positive reviews
while i didn't see any changes in firmness
because i've heard great reviews in the past
saw almost no results
saw no difference between the cream alone
i saw no difference in my dry skin
i didn't notice any visible firming at all
after 3 months of use i see no difference.
i see no difference in my skin after using this for 2 months
which has never been my issue
i didn't notice a difference in my skin at all
i did not notice a huge difference in my skin using this cleanser compared to any other one i've used
nothing since this product
my skin was still reacting too much to it
this turn out to be a huge disappointment
visually, i see no change at all.
this made me breakout a small amount.
the only issue is that lately my t-zone has been more oily
i did not see any improvement in my skin
i also noticed a slight break-out
i can't say if it has improved my skin's overall appearance
then i started noticing a lot of blemishes
didn't notice any changes
i did not notice a difference in my skin
my skin improved greatly
i saw no changes in the skin around my eye.
no reduction in dark circles
especially after seeing all the reviews
since my only main concern are bags
it actually made my fine wrinkles look very obvious
with no huge benefit yet
i did see an overall change in the skin under my eyes
i did see a change in my overall skin tone
i splurged because since i've turned 30 i've magically noticed my wrinkles becoming very defined
didn't see any major changes
i did notice a bit of clarity to my skin
the expression lines didn't change one bit
so far i'm not noticing anything with my skin except breakouts
f it made a positive difference in my skin then i'd hold my breath
i don't see any improvement for my under eyes other than a little brightening effect
on a positive note its a pretty good size
the marks were still there
as mine tends to change a bit with the seasons
didn't notice a positive difference
fresh with an ever so slight cooling effect
nor did i see any difference in the appearance of my skin
didn't see much a change in my skin
i saw no difference after using this the first time
i feel bad writing a negative review
certainly did not show any sign of diminishing fine lines
i literally saw no change in my skin at after using this product
no other skin concerns
there is a slight positive change to my skin texture
there is no noticeable effect.
i would have liked to see any improvement
i didnt see any difference after a week
the effects were super minimal to me
have not seen a change yet
disappointed with the lack of highlighting it does for my dark circles
never noticed much of a difference
it did not make any significant difference.
it certainly didn't seem to have any anti-wrinkle properties
haven't seen a significant difference
have seen no result
saw no difference to my under-eye
except for that my under-eye wrinkles were getting more noticeable
i see absolutely no difference with this
i feel that this has made my undereye creases more emphasized
it hasn't done anything to reduce my dark circles
the cream has an instant brightening effect when you apply it
noticed my wrinkles grew noticeably longer
i did not really see an improvement in circles or puffyness
nothing, no change whatsoever.
this product has made the area look somewhat brighter
i really liked the brightening effect it had under my eyes
haven't noticed much improvement in my dark circles
i saw no difference.
have not noticed any difference in my skin using this product
have not noticed any dramatic change to my skin
i didn't notice any skin improvements
i better see a difference right away
nothing changed at all
i didn't have any negative effects though.
i didn't notice any "glow"
this has been such a disappointment.
after spending quite a lot on the serum
there is no improvement whatsoever
however have not really seen any major changes with lines in face yet
for me is that i simply have not seen any improvement in my skin
at 36 i have suddenly developed some weird skin issues
i fortunately don't have any visible fine lines yet
the wrinkles between eyebrows are not as noticeable as before
the product inside has a cream -gel consistency i do not yet notice an increase in skin firmness
i don't think i have seen the results claimed yet
after the 20 days i saw no real difference
i noticed no differences in my skin after using the mask
my skin did start to change
there is no visible results
but makes my skin worse not better
unless i notice amazing results on my skin in the coming days
when i took it off i didn't notice any difference
never noticed any differences
i saw no change after peeling
found no improvement in my skin
i saw little difference in my skin; 2.
i noticed no other results
the mask doesn't produce any noticeable results.
didn't notice too much of a difference in terms of detoxified
never saw or felt a difference
i did not notice any reduction in pores.
i just stopped seeing results
i didn't notice a difference in either of those issues
which made my skin much clearer than it had been in years
i noticed with using this mask in that our skin looked brighter
however i have not seen any difference since i've used "skin rescue deep cleanser with red clay"
didn't notice any improvements in my skin tone -- same amount of breakouts
did nothing to prevent the occasional blemish.
i did not notice any help with enlarged pores
it just made it worse
im not noticing any significant changes in my skin
however i didn't really notice anything noticeable when i woke up
i saw very obvious changes in my skin tone
the pump was the worst thing i've ever seen
they have definitely faded
i honestly have not seen any improvement on my face at all
i saw no difference except that it made my skin look
aside from the fact that i didn't see any difference after the 7 days
not too sure about brightening though
i didn't see a huge difference in my skin after a month of use
this is a stronger reaction than i've had to any serum
it hasn't done anything to improve the appearance of my age spots
there was no change to my spots
noticed slight change at least on the right side of my face
am totally indifferent because of no noticeable changes
i like the product it has a slight tingle felling when applied
i didn't see much results on the eye cream
i think this cream has made my fine lines worse.
hasn't changed my dark circles either.
i don't have any complaints so far
it didn't make any positive difference
there is a slight brightening effect from the black tea
my fine lines actually became worse
no difference under eyes
expecting to see some effects in the morning as far as minimizing my normal dryness
there are no lasting effect
i didnt notice much of a difference
nothing mind blowing nor life changing for its price
thickness of the product overall because in the end there is hardly anything in the bottle
i didn't see any immediate differences
very rich in moisture but no noticeable effects.
i didn't notice any change to my complexion
my skin had a bad reaction to it
the dry parts of my skin were not improved
my skin was breakout
if i see improvement, i will change my rating.
this one was a total disappointment
my negative comment has now been removed twice!
have not noticed anything different with my skin
i found it to be a disappointment
too bad this caused a mild breakout.
was surprised with this one
there was still traces of foundation on my skin
i didn't notice a difference
not that it mattered
did not cover the unevenness.
i heard so many great reviews on this product about the blurring effect this could create
i notice a huge difference the moment i put this on my skin
i noticed no difference
was very disappointed because i saw no difference
i did not notice any difference in the way the concealer looked or how long it lasted
i saw no changes i had to return if
it really didn't make much difference in smoothing the fine lines
improving the appearance in my under eye area
to get any significant difference in my pore
there is a small difference in pores
although i do notice the "blur" effect whenever i take photos
i did not see the blurring results it promised
if you feel that you have glaring "imperfections" that need to be "blurred"
i expected a better long lasting results
all the effects of this product dissipated
i saw no difference in my skin with this product
very disappointment that i have to endure this $50 loss
didnt notice much of a difference in the appearance of my skin
some comments have complained of the scent
i am going to guess that there is a correlation between the fact it is heavily scented
however this product was horrible on my skin.
it caused the most massive breakout i've experienced in years
this made things much worse
perhaps my opinion will change when the weather is warmer
i've notices its a bit clearer
this did not "instantly illuminate my complexion" or eliminate any of the winter dullness i've been experiencing
have notice no difference in my skin whatsoever
never saw any improvements
i so no improvement in texture
i did not notice any changes in my complexion
i didn't see any changes with dark spots
haven't noticed any improvement about uneven skin tone after 8 weeks
in fact my skin is actually darker than when i started
this made my skin way worse.
for me this product made no changes in my skin.
there has been no improvement in texture
however i noticed no change.
ever since i started using this it has given me more acne
i got it because i had such a great experience with the facial mask
i instantly noticed a difference
however it just makes my wrinkles look worse.
it just seems like an extra step without any noticeable results
at first i loved how it made a huge difference in neutralizing the really dark circles
it has a slight colour to it
i also don't see any differences
it hasn't been a total game changer
does not show improvement to my sensitive eyes
this mask has a weird consistency when applying to the face
however i saw absolutely zero change to my skin after using this mask for months
i don't see any brightening effect
i didnt notice any hydration whatsoever
no noticeable hydration or softness.
there is no difference.
when i use the other ptr masks i can see an almost immediate difference in my skin
i don't notice any change in skin's appearance
despite my research largely pointing to that 'science' being an exaggeration at the least
i definitely have a bad reaction just after using this mask
wanted to like but had an allergic reaction.
i didn't notice any change in my skin
didn't notice a different feeling on my skin
didn't see any changes
a slight difference in fine lines
something was giving my skin a negative reaction
it i had a skin reaction to it
it seems like this mask has polarizing effects
for my normal skin it didn't make a bit of difference
others indicated there was a noticeable improvement
the problem with this is
i discontinued use and the problem persisted.
only the sides of my face are affected
so my star reduction did not reflect this
it kept my skin in the good condition that it was already in
so much i could see the difference in the mirror
while i love the smell i haven't noticed any changes to my skin
my skin's condition improved dramatically while i was using it
i noticed fewer blemishes
did not notice any improvement in my fine lines or pores
this did nothing in regards to covering it up
can't see a huge difference in my skin tone
my biggest foundation problem
only one previously had a reaction
a definite no for sensitive skin.
that was the only thing that's changed from my routine
i did not notice any discernible difference using it alone or layered/mixed with other products
it irritated my skin around my jawline which has never happened before with any product
have not noticed even the slightest difference
in fact this is happening for the first time
i did notice improvement in my dark circles
have taken care of my skin
does not really improve the appearance of my eye area
even without the reaction on my skin i noticed no improvement with fine lines or darkness under eyes
used up the whole jar, no noticeable difference.
i've actually seen my eye area improve with a change up in my other products
don't notice any significant difference to my tired eyes in the morning the product description also says it has a nice scent
haven't seen it under conceler or foundation
so- the irritation was my own fault, but still!
no improvement in tone nor texture.
it hasn't improved anything at all
i didn't see any more dramatic results than i have with other treatments
i honestly haven't seen much of a difference.
there wasn't clear application informtation
there was no noticeable difference on my face
barely made a difference for me.
i did notice that the skin felt softer than usual
despite seeing many negative reviews
you will see the amazing difference in how many blackheads are removed
so theres two steps
this was a real disappointment
i saw an improvement in my blackheads for about a week after using this
significant difference can be seen with my dark circles
i immediately noticed a difference.
night since the am portion makes my fine lines more evident
right away i noticed a positive difference in how the area around my eyes looked
so my positive experience turned negative kind of quickly
i saw no change in my skin whatsoever besides the fact that it was red beyond belief
i noticed an improvement in the look of my skin after the first use
it did change into a different consistency
have noticed immediately after removal how soft my skin is
i didn't notice that the product made any difference to my skin
i feel like i lost several weeks of progress in minimizing my lines from another regimen
didn't see any difference in my skin whatsoever
can't say i have noticed any changes at all
i didn't notice any changes in my skin after i washed off the mask
i did notice it was looking a lot more radiant
no long term results on my skin
i noticed that it left a slight film on my face
saw no difference in my skin
even though i had not changed anything else in my daily skincare routine
a half i noticed larger
however i never noticed any difference in my skin
had the same problem
i saw no change in wrinkles
i tried this for an extensive period with little improvement of the eye area
it has done nothing for my under eye area
have yet to see any changes or prevention
but it seems some have noticed changes quickly.
i found no difference
it had a somewhat soothing effect however
no major reaction, just more teary than usual.
i noticed absolutely no lift whatsoever
certainly noticeable after five applications
i didn't see marked improvement in hydration or skin elasticity
i don't feel like i noticed a difference after using it for a while
this one needs improvement
it did not help brightening.
there is no difference
see no results whatsoever
made them more evident
i didn't even really notice a difference in my under eye area at all
have not noticed any change what so ever
i've never written a review before however
it has certainly been "changed" or reformulated
have used many without any negative reaction
the reaction was obvious from the first time i tried this
the other lumiwhite product does work- i noticed improvement after using it
there is no noticeable difference in my dark spots
on the positive side
on the negative side
if i had miraculous results
it still hasn't absorbed
i never noticed a difference in the lines under my eyes
haven't seen any improvement on my skin
there were zero improvements to the texture
wish i could've seen some positive impacts
noticed no improvement in my skin.
i did not notice any difference in my fine lines while using this product
)haven't noticed any changes.
i still haven't replaced it.
i´m not sure i saw any effect on this one.
at least that´s my first impression
it showed no improvement in radiance
didn't see any improvements in skintone
if your main concern is fine lines
it has made no difference
no noteworthy results or improvements
unfortunately for me, i had a rash.
this experience just solidified my opinion on the br
see no results because i'll feel like i spent $54 to virtually put nothing on my dark circles
i noticed no improvement in fine lines
i saw none of these effects
i didn't see any significant improvements for my complexion
didn't see the brightening effect i was hoping for
i see no benefit.
had no issues with it burning
it didn't leave any noticeable difference
saw no real long lasting results
this treatment did not have any beneficial effects on my skin
was surprised by how much ineffective the 1 minute facial was for me
however the next day it was clear i had a reaction to it
i saw no "one minute" improvement.
this did nothing noticeable
have been pleased with the results
i don't see an obvious improvement in my skin in terms of brightening
i didn't see any real noticeable effects
i noticed no difference in texture or clarity.
i didn't see any improvement or differences for my dry skin
so that magic effect is gone.
i didn't notice any difference in my skin
after noticing no difference in my skin while using it under other products
i see no change whatsoever.
saw absolutely no difference in my skin smoothness
there is no visible benefit
it was fine for the first few days until i noticed the increase in the number of pimples on my forehead
it has been so long since the last time i saw acnes on my cheeks
haven't noticed any huge differences
i did however notice a few extra pimples showing up
they have since subsided
i feel pretty let down since i didn't notice any immediate reduction in the redness of my skin
i didn't notice any difference after several uses
i could've lived with that had the mask not made things worse
had no issue since i wasn't waering any makeup
since using this product i feel like i have seen an increase in my under eye lines
i didn't notice any significant improvement
i did not see any change in my eye area
i also did not notice any 'brightening" effect.
i noticed no difference around my eyes
i did not notice any improvement in the undereye area except perhaps a little more moisturized
i saw no effect whatsoever
this anti-aging eye cream has done nothing to improve anything about my eyes
had no results with this cream.
in fact i think it made my fine lines even worse
saw all the positive reviews
it seems to have caused some minor break-outs
thinking my skin was adjusting
it has really no beneficial property for the skin
at first i noticed a slight improvement in my undereye dark circles
i don't see much firming
don't seem to have diminished at all
also there was no instant firming.
doesn't have any line smoothing effect
this night cream was a big disappointment
have seen none of the anti aging benefits
my skin has shown no improvement with this product
in fact the texture of my skin did not improve
have not seen any improvement
the worst mask i've ever used.
not even a small difference.
i noticed considerable brightening
haven't noticed much change in regards to dryness or texture
does nothing for fine lines or dark circles i have found no difference from using this line
i am only 35 no major wrinkles
a few pumps makes a noticeable difference in the liquid level
got really excited as for the past 6-7 years its gotten really noticeable
it didn't change my redness in the slightest bit
seemed to make my fine lines more pronounced
i noticed no improvement in my overall complexion
saw significant results right away
this mask did nothing to improve my skin condition
this mask has no effect in summer or winter.
saw no difference in skin
however i didn't see any other impact.
don't see any difference on my face or eye area
it didn't irritate nor improve my skin
after 2 months of daily usage there was absolutely no difference at all in the appearance of my skin
it might have slightly made my skin look clearer
i unfortunately saw no discernible change or visual improvement in my skin
i see little to no difference.
i increased the amount significantly
still saw no results
i saw no difference to my skin.
decided to buy since i did notice a lifting/firming effect
all i got was an almost unnoticeable tightening effect
i didn't really see any benefits or positive effects on my skin
ended up with a crusty cover with no discernible results or reduction in wrinkles
could not see any difference with the "tightening" this product claims
i returned it since i didn't see any results
i don't see any improvement after one bottle
i realized that this was the only thing that was changed in my skin routine
this has a tightening feeling
i saw zero difference in my skin
i didn't notice any changes in my skin.
saw no change in my skin with it
firming in my eye area since that's the only place i need it
in contrast to the last review i see on this
jart+ had made the jar shorter with a wider opening i would've liked it better
there was also no difference in my dark spots after using it everyday for a month
noticed that i was getting a lot of texture
keep in mind that i have never had texture on my face
when i had seen this i had instantly assumed it would be amazing
it has by no means erased my wrinkles or any such silliness
it does seems to give a little toning effect.
have not noticed any change
until i noticed it turned to a clear film
i could not see a noticeable difference
i saw absolutely zero benefit to using this product- no firming
i saw no noticeable firming effects
other than a breakout i'm concerned was caused by it
this was the only change i made to my skin care routine
the 'remnants' of the breakout is still there
i noticed no change in my face
don't feel like it minimized the appearance at all
i didn't see any significant improvement
haven't seen any of the softening i had hoped for in what are truly fine lines
while i do see improvements in fine
night for slightly over a month with no visible results whatsoever
the product seemed to be a little tightening
ii would see a difference around my eyes
on my forehead -- nothing has changed
spent quite a bit a money to no satisfaction
though impact is minimal
honestly there was no difference.
i did see improvement of minor wrinkle areas.
short lived result product
i didn't see any immediate improvement in my "11" lines or "crows feet" nor did i see any improvement over the month of use
i did not a cooling affect
less noticeable almost immediately
with not the slightest improvement
maybe it will make my lines a little less noticeable
but, sadly, there was there.
no change in skin texture even.
i didn't notice a difference at all after using this for about 1
maybe it works better for more obvious wrinkles or on more mature skin?
used for a week and saw zero improvement.
really haven't seen results yet
no reduction in fine lines
there has been zero results
actually thought i saw improvement
saw almost immediate results
absolutely no affect on my fairly minimal wrinkles
haven't seen any improvement
so the skin area might make a difference
i saw 0 improvement, long term or short term.
for some reason i see virtually no changes after use whereas with the sample i could see changes immediately
there has been no change at all to my wrinkles or skin
my 1st impression of this was very disappointing i saw no difference in my crows feet
sadly, i saw no results.
i saw no differnce at all.
haven't seen any great improvement yet
saw no changes at all
absolutely no visible difference
there was absolutely no change in the so called promise of diminishing lines
i noticed more of them
it can provide an illusion of lines being diminished-- just as regular makeup can provide an illusion of skin that has less discolorations
i saw absolutely no results.
the past week i've noticed that my skin has gotten extremely oily
although it has not cleared my skin any.
i seen no real difference in my skin using this
nothing noticeably different happened except more breakouts
i didn't notice a difference in my skin the week i used it
didn't notice any decrease in pore size.
it has a great cooling effect to the skin
it ended up being lack-luster
have no skin concern
i didn't notice any difference in my skin texture or reducing fine lines
have not noticed it looking any better
i didn't see a difference in my skin though
haven't seen too much improvement through the use of this product
the worse my skin got
did not notice any change in fine lines/wrinkles or dark circles
naturally i was disappointed when i noticed that philosophy had changed its formula
the results were quite disappointing
i saw no positive changes in terms of dark circles or lines
yet i still haven't seen the results it claims
did not see any improvements
it has a really good brightening effect
other than seeing improvement of my dark circles
i did not notice any changes in my dark circles
that was the only issue i was concerned about
i don't notice any true change in dark circles
my fine lines actually looked worse
haven't seen any difference at all
i developed little non-noticeable bumps
only noticeable with foundation on
this helped decrease my milia so much
been the worst it has ever been
buy some coconut oil that has helped my skin drastically in the past
saw all the amazing reviews it had
my skin never seems to adapt to this
i didn't really see a huge difference in my skin
no difference at all in skin problems.
have not seen a drastic change
no change in my skin what so ever
noticed no major difference in my skin
no tingle, nothing like it claimed.
at the time i was getting a lot of blemishes
didnt get any positive result either
after seeing all the hype
no wonder my skin is confused
ignoring the obvious signs that this was not a good cleanser for my skin
wonder if my skin is reacting to it??
t didn't see a difference in my skin's overall appearance
i saw all the positive
the rest of my skin i have no problems with.
no drastic changes to my pores or the texture of my skin yet
my skin did look brighter until the breakout happened
it made my skin worst
made my skin worse
after several months using it i unfortunately haven't noticed any difference in my skin
unfortunately after using it for about a month i haven't seen or felt any noticeable difference in my skin
have noticed more signs of aging since i started using it than before
after using more than half of a bottle i have noticed zero change
there has been no other significant improvements to my skin -- good
it happened after using this product with no other changes to my skincare routine
saw no difference at all
i didn't notice any improvement at all
when the artist at sephora introduced me to this product you could see the visible results right there
i figured some improvement might occur
i did notice my skin to be smoother
i see no visible difference under my eyes
there was absolutely no difference in my skin at all
this was a definite bust.
none have worked in even diminishing the creases
i even put it under one eye only as an experiment to see if there was any noticeable change
i didn't notice anything different with my under eyes after 3 weeks of use
i also felt that there was a bit of a brightening effect with it too
i did not see an immediate effect nor after 7 days of using the product
made them so much more noticeable
i also saw no smoothing.
i didn't notice any improvements to my skin.
was a little less than impressed
not sure i see brightening or tightening effects
i think i would be more dedicated to using it if i was actually noticing major improvement
there were so many blemishes in number
adding this product to my nightly routine was the only difference in my skin care regimen that i had made
i didn't see any positive changes in my skin after using the whole bottle
i started noticing my skin getting worse
i didn't notice any changes from using it
have seen no change to my skin
as though i had no fingerprints after use
i see no difference in fine lines
i didnt feel any tightness or lift.
i've seen real results with that mask
don't really see any difference regarding firming
hard to get off and no noticeable result.
however i didn't have a noticeable change in my skin
i saw no difference at all
its an easy mask to do, no shocking sensations.
i didn’t notice any of that i do feel a slight “firming” or “tightening” sensation when i use it
saw no results at all, not even the slightest.
there was no visible difference or anything.
i think it has a distinct
i saw many good ratings
after a little over a week i start to notice my skin felt really different
adding this cleanser into my routine i saw no difference in my fine lines
noticed my skin drying dramatically as the day went on
this made me breakout like nothing i've ever seen before
have only gotten more noticeable as i've aged
even if it's a slight change
there had not been any changes with my dark circles
i didn't experience any improvement
after 2 weeks i haven't seen any miracles
that means there was a significant improvement
i tried it on only one eye to compare the difference
i definitely have not noticed a difference in my dark circles
i saw no results
i only had minimal fine lines
has had zero effect on my dark circles
no noticable change yet
no change - at all - in dark circles.
noticed no difference in my dark circles
is going to return the eye cream because it has not change the darkness nor the fine lines
have not noticed any difference in my dark circles
i see a very little difference.
there has been zero improvement:
i don't see any difference in my dark circles
haven't noticed any improvement so far in the circles or lines under my eyes
slight significant results to reduce dark circles
saw no improvement in my dark circles at all
i didn't notice any permanent difference in this making my dark eye circles disappear
no change in pigment
i do not see any reduction of dark circles or fatigue
i see no difference between this
except a huge difference in price
this has been horrible
by the third or use i noticed my skin was somewhat dry--
i didn't notice any noticeable changes with my skins appearance
the fragrance is so strong that i was surprised i didn't have any skin reaction to it
now i have a lot of blemishes whereas i had maybe 1 before
it actually made my skin worse
i've never had that problem before in my life.
saw no difference actually made me breakout love glamglow not this
honestly haven't seen any difference with my skin
it also hasn't made it worse either
my skin had never been that dry.
i've never received a reaction like this in my entire life
there has been absolutely no change
there was no visible difference in lines
did not notice much of a difference in fine lines
literally noticed no change.
my under eye area is no exception
don't notice any difference
haven't noticed much of a difference
it made it feel worse actually
however, i didn't notice any lasting effects.
i saw no brigthening effect or glow.
it did nothing to change the appearance of my eyes
i didnt notice any improvements at all in my skin after using it for 2 months consistently
the only thing i changed was this
it has no benefit to skin
the left one had no actual wrinkle
i don't see any improvement .
however i've never had a problem with any of his other skincare
however, my skin reacted terribly.
great texture as i mentioned before
the only problem i have with it is the tint.
the biggest problem was the color.
am yet to see the brightening effect
this product made it much worse
was not impressed by the results
it's a shame that it had no perceivable effect on my skin
the cons: no brightening results
i didn't notice any improvements in my skin by using this
saw no change in my skin
i didn't see any noticeable results
kind of expected this to blow me away or at least create some kind of noticeable change in my skin
i didn't notice a significant difference with this
this is the worst product i've ever gotten from sephora
didn't see any particular change in my skin.
i didn't notice any difference
meaning not a good shower product-color changes immediately
this was a huge disappointment.
there were absolutely no results
i noticed no difference whatsoever
the only thing i liked was the cooling sensation
a sensation does not equate a physical result or difference
not much difference in brightening after
after i washed my face, i saw no difference.
i saw immediate results
haven't seen any results
i did not see any improvement or changes in my skin after 3 weeks of use
to the point where there was slight peeling
my face looks no different
there is no improvement on my skin
i didn't see any improvements when wearing this under makeup or at night in fact i noticed more breakouts than before
without seeing or feeling noticeable results
and yet, i see no difference in my skin.
my skin reacted negatively to it
on the positive side
my first concern with this was that it has fragrance in it
i didn't notice a big difference in my skin
this is the first one ever to make my skin breakout
i did not notice a significant difference in my skin
but there was absolutely no change to my skin.
not a normal occurrence for me
taking a look in the mirror now compared to when i first started using this i don't see a difference in pores
saw no difference whatsoever.
not a big change in my skin
i didn't really notice a difference in my skin
i didn't notice as much pore shrinkage with this product as glamglow
i no longer observed any further improvement in my skin
didn't see any spot correction
my skin saw no benefit, only negatives.
have had great results
did not see a difference in my under eye area
i see a huge difference in my under eye area
this one is no exception
this product was a slight disappointment
saw absolutely no difference in the size of my pores or the staying power of my makeup
they made it worse
no improvement seen in my skin.
never saw a difference in under eye bags
i wasn't expecting dramatic results.
haven't seen any results
dark circles have never been my concern
trouble areas would see vast improvement
i don't think this product is perfect because it hasn't reduced the occurrence of my breakouts
i see no difference whatsoever
have seen better results with that than with the luna
by now i'm even more underwhelmed
same with the lines in my neck where i had actually noticed a difference
didn't really notice a big difference upon waking after using it several times
my scars never diminished
i never noticed any great difference using luna
no positive changes - at all!
i didn't see any big changes in my skin
only thing i noticed is that it did balance my oil production
there was absolutely no change
didn't see a big difference
i don't notice any change in my skin.
this product had no effect on my skin.
i saw no difference in my skin whatsoever.
i noticed a change in a week where my skin felt nice
saw no improvement in my skin tone/texture/fine lines/etc
in fact it made my skin look even worse.
didn't see any changes regarding my pores or scars
i don't see any difference in my skin whatsoever
that's when i realized that all my results were due to good genes
i like at least some subtle results after 30 day continuous use
i did see an improvement
nothing else in my skincare changed during this time
i've noticed that my acne has increased more by using this product
it made my skin breakout
honestly noticed no difference by the end of the bottle
sadly after every application i noticed my skin breakout
i didn't see any improvements in my fine lines.
the immediate smoothing effect on my skin's appearance
i'd say it's a little worse than average.
i didn't notice any "blurring" as it claims.
didn't caused any sensitivity
haven't noticed a huge difference
notice no difference on "bluring
with zero visible difference
i've experienced more breakouts than usual since/while using this stuff
saw no improvement in my skin
i saw no results at all
however, i was not as impressed.
there is absolutely no difference in lasting power or shine control with or without this product
is what has a slight affect
haven't noticed any real changes in my under eye area
i wonder if all the positive feedbacks are true.
i see no difference after using this product.
i did not see any difference with my puffy eyes.
it almost has a firming effect as well.
for my thirty something skin it's a definite no
so this was alarming
however my skin did look much clearer
it has no long term results particularly as far as dryness is concerned
it barely ever has a reaction
raved about this cream in particular
in fact it makes it worse
one positive is it hasn't broken me out
that was my main concern
it never really absorbed
i noticed that my skin had gotten bumpy
i saw better results with the other.
it is not firming whatsoever
there were no signs of these lines
this cream actually made my under eye area look even worse than before- made my wrinkles more pronounced
i saw absolutely no change
have not noticed any change in my dark circles or the elasticity of my lids
this hasn't changed it
but as for this, i noticed no brighting.
always had same result
saw zero changes to my skin
it actually made my skin worse.
have seen no ongoing difference in my eyes
i didn't notice any improvement in the appearance of crow's feet or crepey skin
with no improvement in dark circles
it does make my skin appear brighter directly following application
no improvements are noticed
though they have not gotten visibly worse
the only product i've ever returned due to sheer quality
have not seen any improvement in crows feet/eye wrinkles
i did not see a reduction in lines or wrinkles.
have noticed absolutely nothing
after seeing mostly all positive reviews
my fine lines have not really diminished at all
my fine lines have not diminished at all
i did not notice any color-correcting properties.
didn't notice any difference
i didn't notice any difference shimmer
im mainly annoyed that there is no ingedients list anywhere
or adjusted it so the clay had a bit more than the gel since the gel is a lot more concentrated
it didn't really change or improve the texture of my skin
on top of the smell which was so over powering i didn't feel any difference
have yet to see a difference in my skin
did not notice any difference from using the mask
gave it a blurred effect without being heavy
my skin looked worse that before i applied it
since i have oily skin the white cast eventually decreases not too much longer after it is applied
i feel like it has been improving my scars
since my face has been getting very dry
but in regards to the claims, i was unimpressed.
this mask was gross in appearance
didn't notice any change to my skin.
it created no difference on the long term for my skin
have not noticed anything different with my skin
i also didn't notice any sort of effect from the mask
saw absolutely no difference in my complexion whatsoever
i do feel the warming effect, somewhat.
i don't feel the "warming" effect though.
i could hardly feel the warming effect
they peaked my interest
there is hardly any left
didn't notice any significant change to my existing scars
is also didn't make any noticeable changes in my skin in the last 3 months of use
i did not notice any brightening or illuminating affects
i've not noticed any difference in my skin after using this product
have not seen any noticeable improvement in the texture or firmness of my skin
i did appreciate the light reflecting properties to it
i did not see any major improvements in my skin
this seemed to make no difference
after one use i noticed that my skin was brighter
its just not showing on my skin
i see no difference
have not seen results ever
i didn't notice a huge difference in clearing my breakouts
i didn't notice a difference in my blemishes
so the surprise was unpleasant
i could see it changing my physical complexion2
i didn't notice any improvements much
have not noticed a difference
i didn't notice a difference in my pores
it never absorbed well
my skin was no longer patchy.
i didn't notice any immediate difference right away or at significant improvement over the course of my trial
i did not see any improvement in my skin's overall texture after several uses
so far i haven't seen any benefits from this mask
had heard great things about this cleansing oil
yet this irritated my face
no real noticeable difference.
there was literally no improvement in my fine lines
no visible difference in undereye circles or fine lines
as of today i'm experiencing same issue
worse than i've seen on my face in years
i dont feel like it has made any significant differences
there has been zero improvement after use
i did see an improvement with that cream not so much with the dark circles
some people might like that tightness.
no noticeable results after 2 weeks
it also actually made my pores look more noticeable
not even a little bit of a result.
this only exacerbated the problem
issue is it actually made my pores appear larger after repeated use
i don't notice a significant or any change done
i found this irritated my skin more than anything
first impression i'm not getting either
after 2nd day i did notice my skin is a little smoother
it has not brightened my skin or done anything else it has claims to
what a difference it has made
after a whole bottle i noticed nothing
but i see no brightening.
photos to see if i was just not fully noticing
honestly i don't see any brightening effect
definitely haven't noticed any brightening
it hasn't changed at all
this mask made no changes in my skin other than dryness
had high expectations for the brightening
this is my first negative review.
who never notices anything
did comment that my skin looked great
did not notice a difference
i really didn't see any difference after using roxolin lift instant skin smoothing mask
saw no change in my skin whatsoever
the worse $100 i've ever spent.
i didn't notice any remarkable instant results.
unfortunately it made my skin worse
for me i didn't notice visible results.
for now it had absolutely no positive affect on my skin
it didn't provide any noticeable results over time
after application i don't notice much of a change in the pigment under my eye
have not seen any results
there was little to no difference in the pimples
in fact i had quite a few more in my problem area
i saw so changes in the brightness of my skin
got the same result
though i didn't see the formation of any new brake outs
didn't see an improvement in my skin
actually caused me to breakout
found no difference in my skin even after using it for 3-4 times
i feel like this had little to no effect on me
i saw no difference in the morning
quickly realized it was the cause of my sudden breakouts
i see no difference in my eyes.
if anything my skin was slightly more irritated than before
however this is great for lightening areas
there is not a single change in my skin
i didn't really notice any dark circle changes
i see no difference in my under eye area.
i see no improvement
i used the serum with no problems whatsoever
saw no improvement whatsoever
this made it worse
on top of it, i saw no improvement.
my skin would've been much worse
i saw no difference.
i do not see any improvement in the light wrinkles around my eyes
saw no visible difference
i noticed no difference.
it has a noticeable greasy feeling
i didn't really see any improvements to my skin
don't see any long lasting results
in term of actual changes to dry skin
as you can see there was zero improvement in either bagginess
i'd say within the week i noticed a difference in my skin
hasn't caused any break outs
didn't notice any changes in hydration of my skin
are influenced by the individual user: i cannot see the slightest improvement in the appearance of my wrinkles
found no "miracles" after using this eye cream
i noticed zero difference
i don't see any changes after the container is almost empty
haven't noticed any difference
it didn't brighten or make any change to the general appearance of my skin
and, i also did breakout a little.
you won't notice much of a brightening effect when you use this
since i noticed a difference once i started using it
i definitely didn't see any brightening or tightening that i've seen in the reviews here
i see no big difference because i have normal skin
i saw no lasting effects at all
haven't noticed any results either.
this has always been an important part of my night time facial regime
while my skin hasn't reacted negatively
saw no change nor improvements
have seen zero change
i didn't see any visible results
although it had the firming
he also wished it had more of that "refreshing awakening" feeling
i don't see any progress so far
continue using this i noticed it doing nothing on dark circles
however, i haven't noticed any differences yet.
i actually think "eye hope" by philosophy visibly reduced my fine lines
using this eye cream didn't improve anything.
i've never had an eye cream that wouldn't make a difference at all
i did read a few comments about breakouts
it caused me to have breakouts on my face at places that never had any acnes before
it doesnt seem to make a dramatic difference
the one i like best is the green one since it has a cooling effect unlike the rest
this mask actually made my skin worse.
i didn't notice any difference in hydration
they have transformed my skin.
it didn't seem that after i stopped using it anything changed for the worse in my skin
i did not notice a change in my skin texture or lines
just did not see any improvement in fine lines
i saw almost instant results
nothing has ever transformed my skin
immediately saw reduction of fine lines
i see the same complaint everywhere for this product
i can already see improvements in my fine lines
it doesn't seem to have any immediate special effect
i realized i have some very minor crowfeet
didn't notice any improvement to dark circles
did not notice a difference at all.
i ended up returning this serum as there was no change in the redness of my skin
it didn't seem to have any effect whatsoever on my oily
i didn't see a big difference in my redness since i started using it
seen very few results with no long term benefits
it hasn't seemed to benefit my skin much, either.
makes no noticeable difference both after application
i don't see an improvement.
didn't see any change whatsoever
this made no difference in my skin
i did not notice a change in my mild rosacae
all the rest of my makeup-i no longer had p
after a week of usage i could see a decent dent in the amount used
in fact i actually think it might've made my breakouts worse
there is no difference in any of the areas mentioned by others
in places i've never noticed before
no real major problem
no noticeable difference in fine lines or hydration
my previous review seems to have disappeared
no difference except some acne which wasn't good
found no problems with it
it was a poor recommendation for me, but thanks
i don't notice any significant improvement in my skin however with regard to fine lines
seriously the strongest not pleasant smell i've experienced in a face product in years
this had the opposite affect
see absolutely no changes
have not seen any difference
to my surprise it was extremely drying
i did not notice a difference in my pore size at all
this rise 'n shine daily moisturiser is awful.
made dry patches more noticeable
i did not see any major difference in moisture level
did not see long term dark spot improvement
i cannot say that it has made mind-blowing difference in my skin
i also think this serum is the reason for my recent break outs
if i don't see significant change
i didn't notice much of a difference
it was barely there
i didn't notice any results with this oil.
i've noticed a more even tone
calmer skin since i've used it
this oil was the only thing i changed in my routine
the amount of inconsistency between the two was crazy
this only had negative effects
the t-zone of my combination skin just got steadily worse the longer i used this product
i didn't notice any difference in my skin as a result of applying it
my skin hasn't changed
no improvement in signs of aging.
this was the only thing i had changed in my routine
didn't notice any special results on my skin
that one changes the game
other then that i got no "glow" effect
i didn't react to it or have any adverse effects
i also didn't have any noticeable results
didn't notice a difference with either product.
i actually questioned whether it was the cause of new blemishes the next day
also have seen no results
i saw a lot of positive reviews here
i didn't notice any drastic changes
didn't see a change in my skin
was hoping to notice skin improvement
i saw no improvements in my skin
my skin has never been so bad before
i've not seen that much of a difference in my skin
honestly i've only noticed my skin being slightly brighter
which takes a long time to begin seeing positive results
my skin wasn't any softer or brighter than the night before
didn't notice any effect at all
see no difference in any of these things
can't say i've noticed any differences
no noticeable difference after using a whole bottle
for the price i was expecting to see some results other than just moisturization
haven't noticed a difference in the bags under my eyes
haven't noticed any improvements when it comes to fine lines
i didn't notice any difference
definitely not for decreasing
though from finishing one jar i have yet to notice any noticeable difference from other eye creams i've used in the past
had never had this problem before
i also like that one of the ingredients has been shown to reduce dark circles
though many reviewers have expressed the opposite
at first i thought this was making a difference
have had no changes to unevenness
it did no harm to my skin
i usually have a blemish or two
i realized that my skin color had indeed changed
my skin has been clear since accutane
i did and there were no more random zits since.
i only noticed about a 10% improvement within the first week then its efficacy kind of just tapered off after that
made it so much worse
once i stopped using this it lessened
two stars because it didn't have any adverse effects such as breaking me out
or making any noticeable difference in my skin
cooling effect this had on my skin
did not see any positive effect on my skin.
didn't see much of a difference in my skin.
doesn't make a difference in skin
no real improvements in skin
hydrates- i noticed an immediate difference
something in it caused a minor breakout
his skin has been fine with this product
didn't see much improvement
notice a bit of a difference from when i just use the sheet mask
it barely feels like it cleans or had an impact on the skin
there are plenty of masks out there that make a dramatic difference in my skin
but honestly it had no result showing on my face.
saw no difference in my skin after using this product
no, i do not see a difference in my eyelids.
so for that reason i didn't see major changes to my eye area
something i hadn't considered--that part of the problem of my irritated eyes was the skin *around* them
there is no difference after i use it
i saw a slight difference around my eyes with this product
i see no difference
the last few weeks i've been thinking to myself that the wrinkles around my eyes look worse
i see no results
i really haven't seen much improvement in my eye area
hope that by then there will be noticeable improvements
i feel like my fine lines are more noticeable
i used this product every day for 3 months with no change whatsoever
used whole bottle with no change in age spots.
waste of money so change or improvement in 5 weeks
saw no improvement at all
have not noticed anything
have not noticed any one of my spots or marks any lighter
i felt like i noticed a difference the first few times i used it
there has been zero effect.
short version: i found this gave much better results on body than face
no change at all.
it might have had the slightest difference in my skin
i see no difference at all
i never noticed any change at all.
since it says "rapid" "lightening" you'd think i would notice something
saw no difference in my sun spots
no lightening whatsoever, no change at all.
i did not notice any changes in overall skin tone
i ordered this product in the hopes it would diminish the appearance
it only exacerbated the problem
still no difference in my skin
i didn't notice any effect from using this product
tried out two months... no signs of improvement.
will irreparably damage not only the surface level
they are still visible
only noticed a very slight
recently i have almost no breakout on my face
since there are many other serums with much better texture
there is nothing rapid about this
had experience with it
he promised quick noticeable results by the time i used 1/2
no difference was made.
haven't noticed any chance or improvement
have seen some minor change on a major dark spot
this product did indeed drastically improve my hyperpigmentation from a bad breakout several months ago
the mark is still there
my skin tone looked worse than it did to start with
i saw no results
in fact it created this dark pigmentation around my mouth i've never had this happen before
my face hasn't been clear the entire time i've been using this product
have not seen any difference in spots or fine lines
i don't think my skin has been worse :-
i like the cooling effect it has though
i didn't see any changes on my skin
it actually was worse
not really seeing any difference
actually gave me problems with small little white bumps i did not previously have
i saw zero difference in my skin as a result of using this
i saw absolutely no results
i can't say i've noticed any improvement in my skin since using it
i saw absolutely no improvement with wrinkles
i think it made my eyes look worse.
i didn't see any improve with my dark circles
i don't see any difference in lifting or firming.
my fine lines are diminished
it wasn't noticeable to anyone except me
although i didn't see much of a change in my skin
hasn't softened up since
this is the only new product that i introduced to my skin lately
effect it had on my skin was amazing
i expected it to be thicker because of previous reviews
