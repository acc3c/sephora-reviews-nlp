i appreciate that it has almost no fragrance
it's enough to tell if this product will be compatible with your skin type
the problem is the price tag.
its an okay product.
considering the price of this product
otherwise i would pass
so for the cost at 1
not to mention the price tag!
the product is better to be used as a night cream in my opinion
with so many other options that also work
usually i expected great results because of the br
i an ready to change product lines into something more natural
which is not to my personal taste
could not manage to wear this during the daytime
with a 95$ price tag i'll have to keep trying different products
i wanted something that will be a new holy grail
i would have given this 5 stars
tttt this product has alcohol
i got this product in a duty-free shop in honalulu
get the mini if you're interested!
waste of product i'll pass on purchasing again
to be honest i wouldn't repurchase
after hearing such amazing things i expected it to show some results
definitely sticking to the value sets
i got the mask in a value pack the other day
that's the only benefit that i experienced
also for the price you run out quick
the results are not permanent
that was my main reason for purchasing
wouldn't repurchase for the results i get
i don't think i will repurchase for the price
it has a lot of alcohol of various types listed in the ingredients
i won't be repurchasing this
i will say that it is not successful while taking a bath or in a steamy environment
i love all other glamglow products
i'll continue to use it since i own it
for the price point
for this price, i expected more.
this product did increase moisture as stated.
will need to fortify or find other....
has the same effect
i prefer to use my finger which then defeats the purpose of this product
i won't be repurchasing.
also i hate the packaging.
even when i use the most minimum amount
i wouldn't repurchase this.
such a fan of first aid beauty
i'll stick to first aid beauty's other
which is why i'm giving it the 2 stars
it didn't particularly affect any of its other claims
i don't find myself reaching for this product a ton
i obtained the same results
disappointing i didnt see any difference with using this with a moisturizer
not to mention i loved all the beneficial ingredients
this has the potential to be a good product.
i apply this onto my face
while i like that it is fragrance free
it did not live up to the other products in the fab line
would not recommend for people with outlier skin.
the stickiness it leaves combined with the breakouts makes me not willing to pay $75 to continue using it once my sample is empty
i won't purchase it
i realized this was the only new product i have added to my skin care routine
would have to wait to apply my makeup
most of my medicine cabinet is filled with it
to be honest i buy this for a quick fix
it was a waste of a purchase
all in all, wouldn't repurchase.
it does not brighten the eye area as it claims
it was easy to apply
this is one of the many eye creams that i have tried
sure enough as others mentioned the twist feature forces product out both when you open
worse closing it forces out the same amount
only reason not 1 or 2 stars is that the price is friendly
and that isn't a good outcome for the eyes is it?
urged me to buy it
even at the drug store
i will not repurchase or recommend unless they think about repackaging it
i think this eye cream is designed for people in their 20s
there are other eye creams in the market can help reduce my dark circles for about the same price
don't use this for that purpose
so no point in wasting product
i got the travel size with two other things.
the round cap does not help.
i enjoy trying different products
i don't have many options to a variety of eye creams since i don't like spending over $40 on an eye cream
it is just average.
could be for their primary demographic
after reading the reviews i thought this product would be a total game changer
i do appreciate the high spf
packaging i decided to buy this
is way way over priced for the mediocre ingredients it contains
now i use this for h
i like the other murad product
my local sephora doesn't sell
in the meantime, it's fine.
i am contemplating buying a new moisturizer because of the smell
so my last purchase was exactly a year ago from this year's purchase with same item#
now i am in search of a new summertime
had to remove all the product
if i could get reimbursed for my rewards points
which represents $100 real dollars
on a deluxe sample of a product that did the exact opposite of what it was supposed to do
all this does is tighten
i needed up purchasing this product after seeing the instant results in the store
the only thing experienced in store
i won't be purchasing them
i will keep using it
for letting us try new products
i like murad products in general
had high hopes for this product
which is disappointing given the price of this product
for the $ there should be one product to h
i would have been super mad if i'd paid for such an ineffective product
i will not repurchase
the effect of any line diminishment can be had by any decent primer
when it became available to get with points
don't plan on using any foundation over it
on the plus, it does work.
this is only my opinion
found an article that said a dermatologist can look at your face
as a primer, it can not hold my foundation well.
i don't know what type of consumer research these people performed
the lines still the same
i prefer the other version of needles no more.
this product is a complete gimmick.
i might re-purchase it for a lower price
decided that this product needs to be rated
besides that this product is a complete waste of your money
i don't even see temporary results.
it is very temporary
i am going to keep using it in hopes there is a cumulative effect
there are several things on the market in this price spectrum that will serve better
kudos to the store for accepting the return without question
which actually enhanced any lines i have
directions are not clear as to how long it takes product to be effective
it was nothing special
this is the only new product i'm trying right now
i do use the 3-step system regularly
i think that this cream is a waste of the money
highly-rated product to proactively address them
even though sephora's return policy is outst
i also don't like the pump container.
this actually emphasized my lines!
i found the product hard to apply
don't know if i'll repurchase unless i begin to see some significant results
the sephora i was in did not carry that specific product so the lady recommended
i gave it two stars because i think it is a unique concept with the dispenser
i am assuming me experience was so different than most posters because of my skin type
his skin is different than mine, however.
for the price i expected more
to face even against the recommendations
i do see short term results each application
which i believe was discontinued tp make room for this new formula
i'll finish the tube but won't repurchase.
i like the packaging
if your tight for money there are other masks that do the same for less
so does targets 5 dollar face wash
i would compare the feel to a regular face cleanser from clean
if i can rate it no stars i would.
i won't be repurchasing.
therefore my hesitation when i buy a cleanser
as others have said
perhaps that was poor placement
really wish they sold refills of the patches.
i am also using the 24k gold patches
they are not as effective as these
though i would use this kit
i also had an additional wrinkle i never had before
didn't get the additional wrinkle
the treatment just seems too temporary
not a life changing product
i might reconsider repurchasing if they give the product packing a major overhaul
i could see the product in the bottle
i think it needs time and careful use.
i could see differences day by day.
it was a complete waste of money
would nor recommend at all
the price is also high
i would like a refund!
sure there are beauty products that overstate their effectiveness
just basic, does the job.
there are other face creams from sephora that i prefer
it happens even when no other products are used
i went to apply my foundation as normal
if you plan on not wearing any makeup on top of this product
i've tried all sorts of combinations
when winter comes in new engl
after trying multiple others with no success
unfortunately as some others have mentioned it pills with makeup
it is annoying when trying to apply foundation.
hence only the 3 star rating
would buy that in endless supply
unlike renewed hope in a jar this product does not absorb very well at all
i will not be buying this product.
however i regret spending any money on this mask
however can not justify price
feels so gross on your face
will not be repurchasing
i recommend saving your money
this is the product for you!
as a two in one product it gets 3 stars
would not repurchase this product.
i try to avoid those in general
even though the claims are opposite
returned to buy another only to find out it the formula had been changed to include an anti ageing element
i find that the packaging is off
i paid alot for a premium product
so those are all plus qualities
on the other h
it has a similar scent as the rest of their products
a skin care expert at sephora referred this product to me stating that it will minimize my blackheads
a sephora employee recommended a ton of boscia products especially this one to help tame my skin
the benefits do not outweigh the cost.
i could buy any face wash
this will be safe for use
hoped these samples would be different
all with the same result.
buy at your own caution.
decided to use it alone with no foundation
do difference after applying
there's cheaper products for that
i won't even be finishing the small sample packet because it just seems like an unnecessary step in the morning
for the price of the product you better believe i expect to be able to use every drop
it seemed to have a lot of potential
i will keep searching.
someone who hasn't already found the holy grail for their skin may like it
i also got it for the anti-aging aspects
a lot of product for the price
i will say this is more of an essence
it was difficult to apply
it was hard to apply my face cream or oil over this
in all honesty this new revamped skin care line is not anywhere near as good as the previous one that had the "active soil complex"
am always on the lookout for new products to use
however i found nothing special with this product
there are products that are just as effective for a fraction of the cost
i still have high hopes for the rest of milk makeup products
the amount you get for the price
i apply this oil
not a total fan of the scent, but it is light.
however-- nothing super special about this oil
you click the bottom once or twice
depending on the amount you want
sometimes i need more than a click worth
don't think i'll repurchase unless they rethink the applicator
this is such a rip off of milk's customer base that i'm likely never going to try any more of their products
for the price point
the product is not life changing
my problem with this is that there is zero justification for the price
cheap oils that you can pick up from almost any grocery store
have no qualms spending on good products
i hate choose-your-own adventure products that don't have one intended purpose
which might be an improvement
not enough oil for longterm body application
not just an ordinary breakout
it did not add moisture or any benefit to my skin at all
some of their other innovative products
my friends that work at sephora urged me to not purchase from this br
after i apply it
then a better alternative is the br
an argan oil that are fair trade
its just a complete waste of money.
although i am not certain that these breakouts are a result of the balm however i will be taking a break from the product to see if it really is the reason for the breakouts
that it is a stick
i personally would not repurchase this.
i suggest you to drink more water throughout the day
honestly i had such high hopes
expectations for this product
overall i would not recommend
i am always open the hunt for a soothing product
if you need a moisturizer/hydrator there are far superior products out there
i love the other milk products i've tried
perhaps this is due to the change in formula
i will be looking elsewhere for a new day moisturizer
i did research on it.
lastly for a product for evening skin tone the spf could've been higher
i plan to finish my current tube
with hopes of the problem being fixed
the point is that i have much more affordable moisturizers with spf
i will not repurchase
i wanted to give the product a good try cause of the price tag
overall i do like the murad products
still trying to find an acne treatment that will work for me :/
don't rely on this one
only buy if you prefer using this as a night time moisturizer
which other murad products did
however it does not contain an spf
i received this product in a seasonal pack together with three origins face masks
i see no benefit
i even tried it with a number of different masks
i enjoy the fact that it has an all-star ingredient list
there wasnt any extra hydration other than my masks
masks will still work just as properly without this product
this product seems like one of those items created because a bunch of folks in a boardroom were trying to push out a new product
the masks work great on their own.
skip this needless step.
my only use for this product now is as a face mist
this is just a waste of money.
personally, i think it’s an unnecessary product.
i could see a few potential benefits from this
i can see how it would be helpful with clay masks by keeping them moist while you apply to the rest of your face
for other skin types
she said that with some kinds of masks
this will show benefits after usage
is this product a necessity?
along with other origins products
i got this in one of the beauty insider rewards as part of a kit
get the same aspect
same results: it has no benefits
many samples are the exact same ones you can get with points
/or as a bonus gift
i tried this product with both masks
i don't think it is necessary to spend money on a mask primer
although it lists lots of "good" ingredients
for many reasons, that is.
e the product in an even matter
the masks will do it all for you.
not a product i would invest in in the future
i own tons of them
there are better options in that price range
or space in my cabinet
we don't need to prime before we mask
then apply the mask
t might have a similar effect
would not recommend or purchase
why bother spending the extra money
this product could work well for you
overall i find it kind of unnecessary
for the price i expected this product to at the very least do what it claims
this should be called an oil not a gel.
i ordered this with very high hopes.
the product isn't justified by the price to me.
i decided to see if sephora had a reasonable option
there are 2 additional problems: it does not rinse off well
this particular product made me break out
wouldn't work long term
this new skin care line is doing nothing for my skin
i agree with another post.
i also had breakouts from it
i saw that it was no longer available
the old cleanser was great for removing my eye makeup even if that was its intended purpose
this new pure plush cleanser is no replacement for the previous line
i am also a fan of the ingredients.
i am now in search of the original as it seems they are no longer making it
i won't be ordering another one of these.
i would not call this a "transformative" cleanser as they do
so save your money for an actual good cleanser!
i wouldn't recommend this product.
will not repurchase this item.
because this does contain alcohol
the alcohol and perfume will not be your friends.
also, my foundation can't build on this.
will not be reordering
$71 is premium for clinique
really don't plan on trying any new clinique in the future
i am also experimenting with a new cleanser
would work well for other skin types
that's to be expected with oil
this product does contain a lot of it
this product has so much potential
had to go exchange it for a more useful oil
going to return and try the organic oil instead.
after using josie maran argan oil maybe i expect a different consistency--will keep using
long background story short
i discontinue the usage before i get to see the result
i don't like the fact that this oil contains alcohol
the jars do not click
i can find similar products at the drug store for a fraction of the cost
the search for a new br
i did not repurchase because i need more moisture
just not compatible with makeup.
which is what it's marketed as
i will continue using it for that purpose.
i won't be repurchasing
combined with my other products actually made me breakout
i find the same feeling with rose water which is a more cost efficient product
test this if possible
my only issue is the packaging.
i wish they would repackage in a pump form
i've considered myself to have normal to combination skin
i also know that this is an ingredient that is put into products to smooth out the appearance of the skin
it seems to be the case anytime i use a product with dimethicone at the top of the ingredient list
if it works it works
moisturizer should be the least of my problems
anybody has similar problem?
was hoping this will provide some level of comfort
tons don't respond to touch the way they are described
i will stick with the one essential eye.
was able to verify that this simply is the odor
that is just personal to me
will not be buying the product.
first of ,i have a problem with the packaging.
would have liked to see a air proof top
at the high price i would assume that there are some expensive
made some special edition essence bottles that were so pretty
i received the product for free from sk-ii to try out
'm now only applying it to problem areas
got these because i was using other br
plus i saw something online that said some companies where doing that
most of them sell on here plus that company tested in animals which is a big no
this company is great with all the issues i was having with the other company
i wish they were wider
i will stick with others
s of similar treatment patches
don't see any benefits after use.
think you are paying for packaging
its not that expensive if you compare it to the sephora br
s eye masks which are 6 dollars a pop
however, i use this for preventive measures.
there are some cons that i found
which i can live by
i love fab products -- there are a few that i use daily
enjoyed it but would not repurchase.
i loved other first aid beauty products
i wouldn't recommend buying it.
i did not notice any specific benefits to using this mask other than the fact it made my skin feel very soft after using
i've never understood the frustration of people who got upset about the removal of certain products from the market
they haven't improved enough to justify the cost of the product
which is also an ingredient in there anyway
giving it 3 out of 5 because of price
otherwise it would be a 5
spend entirely too much money on a company to be deleting valid reviews
couldn't believe it could be this 130 dollar plus item
in the description it says for all skin types
i like to use this
in case it meets the same fate
same results every time.
which to be fair are results that i don't see with 98% of products that claim such results
i can see this being a sufficient product for skin aged at 18 to 24-ish
like the other ones i've tried
i would advise testing the product in person before purchasing
the cream highlighter was difficult to apply from the bottle directly
t's easy to mix in with your foundation or just use as a base
i received this product for free from influenster
overall i like the product
you can live without it
i would consider purchasing more from this line.
i received this product complementary from estee edit via influenster for testing purposes
i received this product free in exchange for my honest opinion
the product in the cap
i couldn't figure out the best way to apply the product in the cap
i think there are more affordable products like this on the market
how to use this product
i like to apply it to my cheeks for an extra highlighting effect
i love the way this product is packaged.
dwell on this product
i already have a product that does that
got a few samples of this as i love a lot of ptr products that are a permanent part of my skin care routine
guerlain products with gold in it
didn't notice any lift or firm effect.
rightful reviews need to be posted
there are other cleansers out there that do the same job
they test on animals so no
i won't be repurchasing this.
one of the reps at the store recommended this whole line
i probably wouldn't purchase the full size since there are so many other great moisturizers that can be used both morning
there are a ton of available moisturizers that work amazingly
i love a lot of other fresh products
i would not call this cream "lightweight
i've had a lot of other moisturizers that either irritate my skin or interact with other products
with that said if you use it with other fresh products such as the hydration mask
i've tried many other moisturizers from other high end skin care br
s that simply perform better
also for the price
as if there was a barrier
love my other fresh products
also has a questionable ingredient or two
i won't be repurchasing
it also didn't reduce my fine lines
this is a product that at best provides basic hydration for a steep price
they said they don't put any of their products in recyclable containers
this is a deal breaker for me--there are plenty of equally effective products that don't create excess waste
i will be discontinuing use of this product.
like the description states
this product is not as good as other products in drunk elephant product line
this is such a poor product i am shocked it is even for sale
all that being said
you could get the same result from a $20 moisturizer
after researching the great ingredient list
overall i am finding i have to use quite a lot to achieve the hydration effect
means i have to apply
as for the luxury oil
all in all set was a good idea as i am new to the line
it comes with 5 different products to try out
will use, but won't repurchase.
then i apply this product
i enjoy using it
this is not my first time buying the product from sephora online
saying that this product will give my skin the total hydra needs especially in winter
the other products from the line
i'll use it up but won't repurchase.
our moisturizer should be our skin's first line of defense
e to its daily abuse
the new is not for me
i will not be purchasing
don't know if the new formula is as good as old
leaves me in search of a new product
this is the second moisturizer from philosophy that i have to stop using because they changed the formula
i miss the original formula
noticed the ingredients are different on the product packet
the new formulation of this product is a real disappointment
the new formula is not even remotely close to the old formula
the new formula is not good.
there was no tester available
recommend testing this one out before buying
put it on as indicated
i assumed it was just my skin doing a usual purge with a new product
other times it goes on
i don't think i'm getting proper use out of the product
i own so many different products by them.
i will use it all because of the price
this goes on as advertised
i've yet to have any of the white issues that others speak of
i just got this product as a free tester with a recent purchase
the results are the same with the pilling
will be passing on this product
they regularly over-fragrance their products which make them more likely to irritate rather than improve your skin
the way my skin feels after applying it i will not be purchasing this
if strong scents are not a problem for you
hope in a bottle products
for something that you apply to your face
this has beyond what i'd classify a strong scent
perhaps i just don't experience some of the skin issues this serum is supposed to address
i will not repurchase.
i do not mind spending my money for a product that produces results
got bumps on certain parts of of my face since using this product
will not be purchasing
i personally would not repurchase due to this scent
i would steer clear
i do enjoy the product
responsible for an entire star by itself
so technically 5-weeks total
for those people mixing it
then the product alone isn't living up to the expectation
the ingredient list is out of this world
i won't be repurchasing
i won't be purchasing.
the product is fine
to use it because of that
what's the deal with the pump?
it's a struggle every single time i have to use it
i expected better quality for the price
will not re purchase.
my only issue with this is the packaging.
the product itself does the job.
tried it based on kathleenlights's recommendation
the pump is absolute garbage
have other skin benefits
i also do need to take off my makeup with micellular water prior to washing because even though i use it as directed
not so sold on this particular product form the line
i felt like i needed to use tons of product
i will probably go with a cheaper alternative next time
this formula is very basic
due to the high amount of sls this may not be your best choice
prior to finding this product
2% versus the 1% in regular head
next time buying the eye cream on its own.
when you go over the original line
not made of plastic so the other br
wouldn't use it as a treatment over night
it's the only item that i will consider repurchasing
i got this in a subscription box
this was the only new item in my routine
product is a basic moisturizer with no special quality
with the high price tag
i would suggest getting at least a few samples to give this a decent trial
make sure it's for you if you're a first-time buyer of tidal
both have been game changers for my skin
had high expectations for this cream
the sales person recommended this one to me
i'll use it up because of the price
don't waste your hard earned money on this product
it hasn't offered anything useful to my skin
this item falls short
i read elsewhere that this product has an a comedogenic ingredient
this product might work for you
may re-evaluate this one in the summer when my skin is not so dry
however besides being just a good lightweight oil free
the breakouts were non negotiable however
use several of their products religiously
please don't buy this product.
fragrance is listed high on the ingredient list
had to buy a new one
i am going to try the multi-active day without the spf
i find myself having to reapply multiple times a day
among other ingredients in this formula
cons about this product
or even below average
yes the purpose s to be oil free
that kind of defeats the purpose
i will not re-purchase.
i am certain this product is to blame
different folks different strokes
use at your own risk.
not enough product to justify the price nor are the results after using consistently
you may as well treat your face with overpriced
this is not even close to being effective.
what a shame they discontinued wrinkle revenge 3
higher price for less volume than previous packaging
i will likely switch to a different glycolic after years of using this one
time to find a new product.
i despise the new package
it feels like ordinary h
philosophy hope in a jar
i would recommend in the winter for extra hydration
after i apply this to my face
will not purchase, however.
cannot use it on my face because it contains
not on its own
i received this item for free with my sephora points
though i try to use up the items that come in the monthly box
won't repurchase for that
i explained it to myself every other way: period cycle
they suggested this product
i tried about 20 ways to incorporate it in my routine
so sad that this product will only serve for my h
consistently makes me break out
i tend to buy designer products
this is what i would call a "clear application" almost like a light moisturizer for your under eye
it does not "instantly correct dark circles" as the description of the product states
at least not mine
i would use this every other night
i don't think i'll re-purchase.
still on the quest...
i won't be repurchasing.
the pitera concentration is so low that it should not even be marketed as an skii product
treatment oils can be purchased from other br
i got this product for free to try.
pros:- ingredients are spot-on
this does not feel in any way special compared to other gels
i do like algenist's line in general though
then i need to apply a second layer.
this may work for others
in result i exchanged the product for something else
so may be an ideal product for men as well
the lack of performance i cannot recommend this product
not as firm as they used to be
will continue to use the entire bottle to see if this works
which i need both
felt like the alcohol content was too high.
cooling it is when you apply it
i like the convenience of the packaging
i received this in a kit with three other products
t can have a greater effect
i do like the cooling feeling after you apply it
i also like the way you apply it as a stick.
its a no just cause the price doesnt match with the value
then you can step up to one of the formulated products that actually gives results
i rarely return purchases from sephora
such an unfortunate effect at the directed use
it is non-slip however, which is a plus.
i've purchased a same exact bar for $3 elsewhere though so won't repurchase this
i don't see any further benefits
for $55 dollars i need to see some instant improvements
said "this mask is made for your skin
i will return it because it is expensive
thought i'd give this a try since i was in the market for a new moisturizer
advertised them like a neon sign
all my other masks at least do something
that combined with the price tag means a no from me
will continue searching for that one great one.
why do companies insist on adding fragrance
even essential oils to their products when they know they are not good for your skin?
for daily use it does not
i saw that you can use the product on to the cotton pad
which apparently isn't the preferred method
hope this review helps others.
i plan to try other products in this line to try out
i like the idea of the individual beads
give you a consistent amount of product
different for a face product
this was an impulse buy
at my age that's a major requirement
i've used better primer for a cheaper price
definitely returning if not i'm going to use it to coat the trees in my yard to protect them from bugs because that is about all its useful for
for the price point
it doesn't translate into making my skin look more firm
the result seems the same
depends on what you want to use it for
still have the same issue
it does not improve the longevity of my makeup
i tried applying it different ways
i can safely say after many trials with this product
i don not approve
based on the description
i find it better as a primer/mask alone versus under foundation
as i always do with new products
this doesn't even give average results
to add to that i don't see a benefit to my skin
so overall, i give this a 3 stars.
not as amazing as they advertised it to be
the product has other ingredients -- aimed at erasing age spots for example -- that would show their effectiveness over a longer course of time
the application method is not my preference
i didn't return them since there isn't many options for organic/ natural products safe during pregnancy
all in all for this price
it turned out to be a total fail
i used it all but i won't repurchase.
most of cover fx's products are bomb.com.
for this amount of money
i could have purchased a better product out of my local box store for a fraction of the price
made my foundations separate
its an okay product
i also tried it with no makeup
brought this product to use as both a primer
i tried this in all 3 ways suggest
i will not be repurchasing
i think this will be one of the last products i buy solely based off "bigger" yt'ers raving about it
total fail every time.
emilynoel83 is the only exception
one of the women recommended this product to me.
thinking they would work well with each other
i tried this product several ways because i wanted to confirm it was not user error
had high hopes for this
i don't mind spending the money
adding additional steps to my routine if the product works
although i did find this product to help reduce oilyness
another issue i had with the product is the dropper is way to big
getting a sample before investing $52 for a product that may not be the holy grail you were hoping for
using it different ways
wasting tons of money in the process
unfortunately i fee like the only results i had was hydration
for the $90 price tag
total waste of a lot of money.
scent is not over powering at all which i appreciate
however i didn't see any benefit for depuffing the eye area or any brightening as it claims
in every price range
that i think this is buying for the name
most sephora staff will give you options in various price ranges if you want to find an anti aging moisturizer
i like the packaging
tender when you are applying it to the face
you can get the same benefit from a cream 1/3 the price so save your money
you would need to address your dehydration needs separately
this product just ends up being an unnecessary step
will not recommend or repurchase.
the company would put much less money into deceptive
for 60 dollars i was expecting a complex formulation
this was nothing special
no real pay off
great product if you are willing to spend the money for it
i did have higher expectations for this product
give this product a try
i think they put that word in products to attract the more mature ladies
so i had high hopes for this product.
i wouldn’t use my points to get one
i am as fair as the very fair model in the video here
do you apply your primer over or under it?
i tried it without makeup to see if it did any better on its own for a natural
i can't believe this is rated as high as it is.
hence the three stars
there was nothing special about it
i've tried to make this work many ways
overall i wouldn't recommend this to anyone.
i reach for this
it doesn't offer coverage in terms of color
i would need this product to go further if i were going to incorporate it into the daily routine
i expected more for the price
the packaging for glamglow is what draws me in
i consider me skin combination
at least i don't.
for this price i expect more
those are the pluses.
this is not the right product to use
i even use similar products from other br
this product was no exception.
however, for this price i expect miracle work.
in general i like this eye cream
what i seriously dislike is the packaging that this product comes in
i don't want to open it
this is just fair
based on the price
the fact that this says it works immediately
especially based on the price
have no need for a face scrib
i won't be purchasing this one
the description for the product
i also found that for the price there are better cleansers out there
despite the product description
was therefore a good makeup base
tried it with different foundations
you could probably get the same effect from a drug store moisturizer
except for this product
no idea how to remedy it
i would not use this product during the daytime with or without makeup
never from clinique products
wholeheartedly recommend everything i listed above without any hesitation at all
it doesn't have any immediate special effect
already have tons of other products that do the same job
come on sephora how about some quality control
it's just not well executed
i would still use a primer with it
it isnt a must buy item for me
i still had to use a primer on top of it
i will stick with the similar product that i already use
buy their new products
it was as if i had not applied any moisturizer.
like others, i received this as a play!
the roll-on applicator is not the best option for the use because as you apply it it takes it off
i didn't get to use this product very long because the tube would not dispense any of the product after only three applications
dragging is unfortunately necessary
it was the only thing i could find with a substantial amount of zinc pca in its active ingredients
like other have said
will not purchase it because of the strong scent
looking at the ingredients
this has continued to be a struggle
i did not use this product ling enough to comment on the benefits due to a very strong scent
i won't be purchasing this
the amount of fragrance in this product is appalling for it to be skin care
for me that is the only positive feature of this product
instead of helping with it
i can see a difference in the longevity of my makeup
not that different from any st
it would be a good product for maintenance
nothing to offer for the 35-40 group
i would not purchase
i will have to revoke this from my "hearts".
everyone has different skin
due to the fragrance i am unable to use
before it does i usually develop a headache
this is one of the better boxes i have received).
while i did not notice any of the claims this product makes i will continue to use the sample to see if that changes
if you are prone to break outs i suggest you steer clear of this product
i wouldn't recommend it especially for the price.
this being oil free seemed intriguing
save your money on this one
an employee at sephora recommend this product to me
this is a total gimmick
the packaging got me for this product.
any product with the word water
once i apply my makeup
this product gets tacky as well also adding to the reason why it should be used as a primer
unfortunately i will be exchanging this product
hope this product works out for you if you choose to purchase
this product did not absorb at all
all of them that were included in the shipment
what a waste (of my other products).
about time that they made something exclusively for oily skin
that being said- i'm not sure that it differentiates itself in the product category
all too often in this pricepoint i find that the products don't live up to a higher quality st
its a no for me
possibly used at a higher percentage than recommended for sensitive skin??
i hate to give such a low rating
for the mild outcome of it
the downside is you're paying $22 for one ounce or product
concept of the packaging as it's practical
tons of other products that do the same thing
based on this alone i cannot recommend this product
i agree with other reviewer's
lots of alcohol in this product
love the rest of origins products
it was difficult to apply with fingers.
i don't think it applies even therefore made it difficult to remove once it dried
you'd think with the apparent alcohol content this would be faster
not sold on this face mask.
i will not be repurchasing.
it was such a hassle to remove
unless you have 30 minutes to devote to just removing the mask
you have to use a lot of product
the directions should said "apply entire tube"
wouldn't recommend or repurchase this product
that's about where it's usefulness ends.
other than that this product does nothing at all.
this mask was a waste of money for me
as some others have said
i don't notice any anti-aging benefits
i will use mine up
does what is advertised
am a fan of some of their products
don't waste your money for the theoretical convenience of a 2-in-1 that is really just a zero
this is supposed to be an improvement over the original miracle worker eye
found better results in other products.
it was not heavy at all
no maters how thin i apply or how long i wait to apply make up
this seems to be only a temporary tightener.
an employee at sephora assured me that it was "one of their most popular products"
i don't like the application process where you have to mix water
i will nor repurchase.
i am going to have to discontinue using it.
this product is definitely different than most other products i've tried in the past
it is at the bottom of the ingredient list
plus it is hard to find products geared toward my skin type in k-beauty lines
these are all true.
i apply after i shower
i believe the problem lies with the oil in the product that remained after i pat in the cream
a def win for its marketing department
there is no product up there
would not purchase in the future
in comparison to other similar products
as i already use many lancôme products
can't speak to the full range of benefits or how effective the product is when used long-term
out above the others
i hope to find a moisturizer at half the price with same results
see if it has any long term effects on the skin
buy something more affordable
any cheapie moisturizer from the drugstore would work better than this at a fraction of the price
i wanted to use this before makeup application
i won't be purchasing this.
in addition to having alcohol
i would avoid this
i wouldn't purchase this product
i feel the product ages me based on its scent alone
agree with other users that fragrance in skin care products is bad
after that total breakdown
i received this in my play box like many others.
however there are 2 cons that prevent me from giving it a high rating
and this is possibly the cause of con number two.
i would never purchase a moisturizer with this much alcohol
use a different product for daytime
i wanted to love this product because of all the claims it based
because of the affordable price
doesnt leave any white reside
i would not repurchase.
not sure if this is a new formula or if i'm getting products mixed up
if i could rate it that high
i feel like since the label on this product looks different
the only benefit is the spf.
t is available in stores
mentioning this to perhaps help you save on shipping charges
this product is difficult to apply
i got this as a replacement for the other sephora-br
which defeats my purpose in buying it for the spf quality
being that i need to purchase a different spf
i no longer buy this product
as in the product
each time i use it i resent purchasing this item due to the misleading above-average ratings :
offering everything i wanted
i tried applying a generous amount
at almost $10 more in price than other cleansers in the lancome line
i tried this cleanser based on the staffs recommendation even though i know foam textiles are not always best for dry skin
i wish i can trade for another product !
most of the description on the package is in other languages
another bad product i was recommended by a sephora person to buy
will not be buying this product
this will also bring out any texture or acne on the skin
for the price this is not a product for me.
suppose use at your own risk depending on your skin's sensitivity
it may work for others
s after using it
we both purchased it
the hype is false.
it is not a life altering experience .
'm giving this another chance in conjunction with their toner
i don't buy into the argument that new products often 'purge" your skin
i don't think i will be repurchasing.
because i think my skin did benefit from using this in some ways
however my main purpose for purchasing this was to clear up some breakouts i'd been struggling with recently
was hoping that this oil was as proactive
for the price tag of the item
gross a little bit after i apply it
i can use other face oils with the same amount of 2-3 drops
e it to this product alone for sure
all of that being said
making it hard to apply to my face
for the price tag i won't be buying
i believe it was due to the citrus in the product
that's likely because of its fresh
i don't think the results justify the price tag.
most fresh products are for me
until you took a look at the ingredient list
for the price tag
after looking at the ingredients
other than that, the consistency is so gross.
seem to be taking up room where actual useful product could be
this is a total waste of money.
i prefer other brands for face masks.
this mask is really gross!
if the price was more appealing i would certainly buy it to give it a fair shot
especially not when i can buy a jar of the same condiment from the market for $5
the only downside is the consistency
i would definitely recommend using a few samplers before dishing out the money
tried this mask purely for the scent
for the price i wouldn't purchase it
3 stars b/c i think it would be a fair consideration for anyone with sensitive skin
i am thinking i could get the same results with some organic marmalade at a fraction of the cost
she said there was no benefit to using a tool like that
used to be a wonder of a product that i'd recommend to everyone
which i could do with the original version
i definitely preferred the previous formula!
that i can deal with
there is not fragrance added.
her products are supposed to be natural
i could definitely see her products being a problem for those with sensitivity issues
normally i love all products from this brand.
most people are correct it does indeed leave a film
unless you are possessed of the fairest of skins
i would simply recommend another eye cream
this is a good alternative to the boscia luminizing black mask
if you can move beyond the ingredient list
illuminating primers out there that would do the exact same thing as this cream only at a much lower price
the major flaw for me is the packaging
other reviewers said it should be in a tub like container
decided to buy a new one
the staff member who assisted said certainly that this was the exact same as the black mask
have two very different results
they are two different products made for very different reasons
i don't like the new formula at all.
there are lots of better ones available
or whatever is recommended
it was easy to apply, and remove.
trying to find a way it wouldn't be a total loss of money
i do as instructed
i did some looking online
the price on the other h
i feel this product lower cost dupe would be burts bees mask
except for the heating that this one has that the other does not
want to get point for your sephora account
i’ve been wanting to try several other farmacy products
as the name suggests
i could see one or two small acne spots trying to form
you do a spot test
i won’t be purchasing this
still plan on trying several other products from farmacy
this product is a fail for me.
just overall a fail for me
i feel like this is one of those products that sells you on the packaging
if they made this in smaller amounts for cheaper that you could use quickly then i might consider purchasing
in my opinion is equal to or better than this mask
i would save your money on this one
even if the packaging is on point
before purchasing go into the store
it would be worth it to ask for a sample to save yourself from returning
even under foundation or cc
does not look at all natural
it may be fine for a regular cleanser.
in terms of the formula, i liked it.
like other fresh products
my skin is particular
cannot get over how strong it is
will be unable to use it :
that and alcohol are big "no nos."
the perfume alone keeps me from purchasing
will not be repurchasing
it also didn't improve skin in any other way.
for these reasons i rated it three stars
tried this new product
any essential oils that i actually wanted we're at the bottom of the ingredients list
expensive for the results i saw
please save yourself the money
without all the hassle
this is all gimmick
for the price, i expected better results.
there is nothing special about the results you get from this mask
at the price point
that can lose its fascination after a few applications
i got a deluxe sample that enable to try this out 1 week apart
the scent is the kind of like essential oil which i believe some people would love
therefore you could get your h
i love trying new products
there are plenty of other masks that are more cost effective
i can get the same results with other masks with a lot less hassle
the magnet + iron combination feels more like a marketing novelty to bring in cash than an actual "miracle" product
they are so sheer
i will not re-purchase
if you want to treat yourself to a mini spa day i do highly recommend it
difficult to apply per the directions!
while the product is easy to put on
i am not scrambling to pay other bills
love all other murad products in my routine
after changing other face products
have never had any type of skin issues from any other product like this product gives me
will not be repurchasing
the pump dispenser did not work
that in itself is a deal breaker for me
there are many other facial cleaning products that consider functionality
i would repurchase because it is pleasant to use
only if the item is repackaged
will not be repurchasing
i give the packaging 5 stars
only 2 for my personal experience
why does this product have to be dispensed like basic h
i don't think i will repurchase it
i should mention that i do use an acne treatment
was on a quest for a new cleanser
only 8 oz of product i expected more
i've gotten the same results with drug store cleanser
i think if it was cheaper i may have repurchased
only drawback was i had to keep applying it.
nothing age prevention about.
i also did not notice anything beneficial besides the light moisture
it also wasnt anything special
does not stick out amongst other anti-aging
i rather use other products than this.
won't repurchase if i find something better for the value
for the price tag it carries it does not deliver.
i'd rather buy a drug store br
for the same experience
i've given it a fair shot
the cleaner from the same youth to the people line
it is not worthy for $48 on 2 oz.
the ingredients are what sold me
for the price point
i love that they are cruelty free
this one is a total miss
save yourself the money
t can be worn alone or under foundation
none of the products are suited for my skin
from the description of this product
i planned on covering it with a foundation
i might be able to cover it with a very full coverage foundation
foundation is necessary to cover product just like the directions state
i gave it the benefit of the doubt
however my experience with it has not been ideal
t draws attention to what i'm trying to color correct in the first place
even after applying my fair foundations
the jury is still out
maybe someone has successful tips for me.
i found myself mixing with other serums to make it last more
i will not be repurchasing it.
cruelty free is hard to find
like many others they are gushing about is not "life changing"
i will not repurchase...
there are similar products with less chemicals
should feel more luxurious for the price.
kind of defeats the purpose of having this
i don't think it lives up to the price tag with the quantity offered
if you do purchase this be cautious
the only reason i'm giving one star is because of the packaging
i would say spending your money on other it products
i like the packaging because it has a pump
also the pump wasn't working well for mine
my makeup would separate
i can wear foundation with it
i would have to remove the product
i tried it with every foundation i own
same results every time
i believe it offers a natural finish
there are better options at the drugstore for 1/3 of the price
i would recommend to people who need more moisture
specifically in the areas the cream was applied
to look at the pictures next to each other
most higher end eye products don't do this to me
i would not recommend this product based on price
regarding the fine lines i was not expecting amazing results from the sample alone
i prefer to use this only at night
overall i will not be repurchasing this product by will use it up
i wouldn't recommend this product
i see no results
had high hopes with this product
not sure about repurchase.
this cream delivered everything i would want
i just couldn't live with the added fragrance.
makeup product works differently for each person
or a combination of the two
after doing some research on this cream
everything it claims matches my needs
sadly, i won't be repurchasing.
i will not repurchase.
i plan on using the entire thing
i would recommend this as a daytime cream instead
not combination skin like mine
ultimately it does a great job of protecting your skin
i may try the treatment
had such high hopes.
that is about it
i definitely won't repurchase
at the moment i wouldn't recommend or repurchase it
especially because there are similar drugstore products for a fraction of the price
i will use the current jar i have
such a simple product was such a disappointment
it was such a waste of money.
i am already a fair person
girls with combo skin should use with caution!
while it does offer some coverage
i am still trying to work with it to determine the right amount to blend in
further try it out with different application techniques
although i have essentially been able to control my acne
well after applying the product to my face
which is not the kind of product i was in search of
tried this on its own
my only question is
the jury is still out on this product for me.
i wish is was more matte
i just use my fingers, no tools required.
i often use this in place of a real foundation.
would not recommend alone as a moisturizer
i also work during the day with a dental mask
it doesn't seem to aggregate either conditions on my face
i only have to wear bb cream on top of it to be satisfactorily covered
the only thing that i am using consistently is this
i will get it in future
it will work the same
which should be an option
if i could give it a negative rating, i would.
go with the clinique one or heimish one
besides i had to use a ton of it.
i got this product as a 100 point perk
i will not be using this often
also, not a fan of the scent.
i decided to try this as an alternative to the clinique cleansing balm i normally use
i think this is just as effective
as i don't notice any distinct advantages over other products that don't smell
i will not be likely to repurchase this
as stated by another purchaser of this product
i knew my current cleansing balm was coming to an end
had high hope for it
was hoping to find a cheaper alternative from the above
i will continue to use it
i would not repurchase
will continue to use because i spent the money
most of my products are from this br
which is something that i can live with
i recommend skipping it!
that said, i won't be repurchasing.
it's on a level of drug store cream in that regard at a much higher price tag
will not be repurchasing.
one star for poor customer service
agree with the other poster about it not working well with primers or other makeup
but i won't be purchasing because of the smell.
must change the scent
i cannot believe they market this as lightweight
had high hopes for this
it is like all the other products on the market with the exception of it being for a good cause
if you are seeking a great primer
not something i was expecting for such an expensive product
i expected it to be different.
ter at your local natural food store at 20% of the price of the lxmi product
you're paying 80% extra for packaging.
nor did it reduce any line of expression.
other than that, don't waste your money
i will return this product due to i am a makeup junkie along with good products that help with aging skin especially under my eyes
i should have repurchased the line release under eye repair cream
for the price i hoped for some improvement
started using this to try to remedy that
i got this as a free gift with an online order.
this for the foundation
contrary to the directions on the bottle
you need way more than 1-2 pumps to fully clean/cover your face
those dark specs are already in the in mask if you look closely enough
which by the way was not water proof
depending on your skin type this may be a great addition
there are others out there that do the same for a fraction of the cost
i love that this company does not test on animals
hard to apply for me
i will be experimenting more with this product to try to find some sort of happy medium with it
bought this because i really make an effort to buy "clean" products without toxic ingredients
this is the total opposite
had no scent at all also
i see no other benefits
i figure i would try this product as the review where 5 stars
sold on the double clean concept now.
had high hopes for this
i received this product free to try from influenster
they chose the detoxify version for me
i think i'll try the sensitive version because i do enjoy the two step process
i figured it was because my skin needed to adjust to the new products
the bar on the other h
), my skin must have adjusted to this product.
it may have been the oil
i would suggest purchasing a different product
i will continue to use the oil.
just use the oil part
i got this product free from nfluenster for testing purposes
i would recommend this product to anyone looking to change up their skin care routine
i received this from influenster for free.
i wanted to make an exception for this
then apply this oil
wouldn't go out and purchase or recommend
i like the package design
convenient for travel so 3stars
the concept behind it
i received this product for free through influenster
i can already tell a different on face.
i like the idea of a matched double cleanse set--i haven't seen many of those so far--
other than that however
i got this set for free through influenster for an honest review
the bottle of oil could use a better design
do not plan to repurchase
overall i wouldn't buy this
i'd buy other products from this br
*i received this for reviewing purposes at no cost
i do enjoy using the cleansing oil on its own
it was also not ideal for the shower.
me on the other hand would only buy the oil.
i am guessing it is because it is the trial size.
i received this product for free through influenster
including this product was the only change i've made
i did have two breakouts
i don't really like the individual products
i would be interested in trying the charcoal bar though
i will definitely repurchase!
i receive this set free from influenster.
i don't plan on purchasing this mask
after some use this hasn't proven to provide that
i won't be repurchasing
i will stop using this as it emphasized my fine lines
i will post more products with my review in a day or two
i do not suggest purchasing this product for mature skin at all
for the price point
i think it may under perform
some how with trying to incorporate this product into my regime i ended up breaking out more
while i like that this is a 'cleaner' product
i guess sephora is paid by lancer to remove negative ones
the hype around this product
i used my beauty reward points to try this primer out
i applied it under my foundation
just for highlighting areas
it would serve a better purpose as a spot highlighter reserved only for the high planes of the face
i think this should be reintroduced as a highlighter only
waiting for the right lighting to make their presence known
with no other makeup
could benefit from what it has to offer?
unless you want to have an arts
crafts project all over your face
i got two of these as 100 point rewards
i would use this as a highlight touch rather than apply it to my entire face
s that had leftover product
i apply it to my face
this product is for you
would i ever recommend someone to purchase this.
i got this from the rewards bazaar
you will have the same product
i rely on them before purchasing a product
this would add highlights
s if you apply it to your face
s were covered in it also
has one that is $16
its not a must have product
i received this eye liner as a free trial from influenster
i would rate this as an average product!
although it does work well for that purpose
i cannot justify the price of this because it isn't life changing for me or something i find necessary as an extra step in my routine
i do not plan to purchase in the future
i received this product for free for testing purposes
at the price point
thanks to influenster i was able to test this out for free
i don't think that i will purchase it as the price point is a bit high
i don't think i'll be purchasing this product.
because of that i can’t really report any long term benefits
when i would apply it
i received this product for free from influenster
i believe the consistency
i received this product free.
i received this product via influenster for free in return for my honest review
i would not purchase based on the results i saw with what product was provided
i received this product free from @influenster for review purposes
am not able to speak to the long term benefits of the product
if it were inexpensive or you have expendable income then yeah buy it for general moisture
i received this product for free from influenster
com for testing purposes
lancôme to test out in our voxbox
i can say that it works well with the liqui-pencils influenster sent in the box
i received it to try for free through influenster
like any other eye cream i use
also didn't see any anti aging benefits.
currently use the cleanser
i did experience some sensitivity issues
i still needed an additional moisturizer on top
but it also seemed to aggregate my acne too.
this was recommended to me at sephora for fine lines
i did not find the scent offensive.
not necessary for the very short term results
the smell is the reason for the 3.
it's says that it can be used for all ages
i would not pay the price for this product
there are many other products out there that are cheaper
there is is no need for fragrance in a product like this
i really wish this was in a fragrance free version
overall i'm convinced there are other products out on the market in this price range that perform better
the whole concept of it is confusing
moisturizer in one" implies that it will be replacing those products in your routine
it was a temporary fix
the instructions tell you to use 1-2 pumps.
would not bond to face
this product will impact your skin for the better
not for wearing by itself
i will use it as that instead as a primer
using it by itself all over the face is not flattering
just not of my personal preference
use a different primer for those.
no i got find a new primer :(
she recommended this as a solution to both problems
i usually love anything that is from the first aid br
i usually love first aid products
average moisturizer - could do with or without.
so not a complete waste of money
i'll save them to use when traveling
fragrance is very high up on the list.
just means i have to use eye specific makeup remover first
overall, would say good for travel.
i can get higher end cleansers for the same price per ounce
i also realized that its not as inexpensive as i thought when i ordered it
i will not be repurchasing
though i will continue to use up what i currently have
i feel like i can find something similar for a cheaper price
is total false advertisement
no where close to justifying the steep price tag
depending on why you're using it
it will help other products stay on the skin longer
not drastic enough to justify the price
there are many other products that work just as well for this
applying it was like applying cheap h
which is an accomplishment in itself
i prefer to have no fragrance in my face products if possible
t cannot be an expired product
if you are interested in getting one of these
i will not repurchase it.
true foundations for me
but this did not prime my skin and extend it.
will i repurchase this?
i didn't notice an extension of my foundation wear or any additional hydration so sadly
i wanted to use this under my makeup
does well with any foundation
overpriced for the results delivered.
and for the price point?
when i go to apply my foundation
which in fairness may not be from this
when you apply some to your h
it does live up to its name- it fees like cloud
i will be sticking to coconut oil until i find something more natural
now i don't mind the ingredient if it is at the bottom of the list
it didn't provide any firming
that's where the benefit ends
it is difficult to apply
i wish this comes in more tones
i am an active person i exercise daily.
i can wear this while excersicing
if this was cheaper or if sephora made their own version i would buy it for sure
the real problem is that they claim the shade is universal
would have given this 4 stars if the shade had been universal to all skin tones
its a no from me
as i've used many different products on my face to try out what helps to keep my oil under control
the cost did not justify a repurchase
cheaper alternatives are out there
right now and i applied it at 7a.m.
this product is just another one to add to that list
otherwise i would pass
or the use of all 3
many of which are at a lower price point
what i have come to learn is that clarins loves to add fragrance to their products
where it falls o the ingredient list is rather alarming
as it is in larger quantities than actual beneficial ingredients
however, i don't notice any other improvements.
in the meantime it is a nice product
my skin still look the same
i did like the results i obtained with babyfacial
still want to try out other drunk elephant products
it is important for customers to have access to genuine reviews
i will continue to buy
also did not provide any clarity
i do think more oily or all over normal types will benefit from this
i am not an employee of any of the above mentioned
i like this mask because of its quality products
the contents were already mixed together so no cool packaging for me
now i use all kinds of foundation
after every single use.
i like the concept of this product
its in one spot only
offered me another all organic br
i guess first thing i'm asking next time about is organic products
forget trying to apply a foundation over it.
still the same result
i suggest not to use it under your foundation.
giving it 1 star for the package
i tried this product with high hopes.
i can get similar results with any argan oil
i enjoy using it
i will say that for the steep price tag i would expect an amazing skin transformation
josie marian may need to rethink that one.
if the price was more reasonable i would definitely consider buying it
milk to get the results i want
will spare no expense
this oil for the price isn't any more potent
have the luxury of applying good skin care even in the afternoon
if you're debating ordering it i'd say order the regular argan oil
i need a product like this
this is one of them
as for its performance
wouldn't recommend purchasing it
which is not normal
the packaging is a bit of a concern for me
add more if necessary
i would recommend it for that only.
probably because straight up beeswax is high on the ingredient list
i think plain coconut oil from the grocery store works better
i'll use it up but i wouldn't repurchase.
it's sub-par in so many ways
not enough to warrant the "foaming" in its title
this product just seemed to enhance it
i've never experienced something like that from any other soap
it was surprising because it specifically states it can be used for dry skin
is able to remove most of my makeup
i wasn't sure if it was the cleanser or my current stress levels
considering this is supposed to be a deep cleaning product
all it did was create a ton of texture
i also tried teaming this with both a light
once i did further research on the product it stumbled upon the fact that it contains mineral oil which my skin does not agree with
this was just my personal experience with this formula
save your money on this one
i will stick with that version.
the downsides are that
i've had similar or better results with products that cost 1/4 the price
f you have the means you should try it in your lifetime
not at all what i would expect out of a moisturizer that typically costs over $150
on the other h
when i started to apply my makeups
wishing days of using it
save all that money
use your money elsewhere.
i'll stick with the original
don't spend your money on this
it was easy to apply
i will not be re-purchasing and do not recommend.
for such a high price
always tap the product in
did philosophy change the ingredients?
i received this @shiseido ibuki smart filtering smoother complimentary from @influensterca to try about a month ago
the only real issue i had with the product was that depending on which foundation i paired it with
which isn't its intended use
i wouldn't repurchase on my own
i received this product for promotional purposes.
i am not sure how to incorporate it into my makeup routine
i received this product for free from influenster
i think they are average
i received this product complementary from influenster for testing purposes
i'd say this product is great on its own
save it for more makeup free days
i received this for free through influenster.
also this is not a primer!
at the bottom is fragrance so will not repurchase
i expected something different
i then emailed biossance directly asking if they include the protective plastic lid
for a person in their 20's
see on the expense of my lashes
im willing to shell out the bucks for an effective eye cream
i felt as a consumer
i recommend to sample it before spending your money to see if it works for you
in comparison this oil doesn't perform as described
e anything more than other %100 squalane oils out there
that it was cruelty free
which is my fault for not paying attention to the size
while the price is great compared to many other eye treatment products
i rarely return items
s that work just as well for 1/10 of the price of this
it did not have any strong fragrances
i received the product for free as part of a promotion from the br
purpose of the eye cream are not clearly stated on the packaging
am currently on accutane
i received this product complementary from influenster
i received this product free to try from influenster
i appreciated the flip top cap
the price is very reasonable at $25 for 5 oz
overall the product wasn't for me
this moisturizer in particular has done nothing special for me
while i like some other products by this br
i wouldn't re-purchase
likewise daily sheer suncreen does not go well over it
i received this product free from influenster for reviewing purposes
for free in exchange for my honest review
i will start off with the packaging
working in the cosmetic industry i can already tell you a lot of people will not like it
i can see this product being
staying matte on other people
i don't think i will be repurchasing after
i did not use all three products in the line
i will stick with those
i received this product free to try from influenster
i received the product from influenster to try as a system
i would recommend the other 2 products over this one
i will be sticking to the sheet transformation moisturizer for now
i received this as free product to try.
out of the 3 products in this line
i did receive this for free through influenster
which is great cause i have been using the br
watched a video this product is not easy to use
the directions enclosed don't make it clear that you are only mixing the product once- not every time you use it
it was hard to know what was a proper dose
i think the idea of the packaging
i love that i pop open a new one of these
felt it was necessary for this
i recommend keeping expectations low
i assume by day 7 i will notice a difference
my issue is solely with the bottle itself.
we have the same skin type
i like the packaging
i don't see any lasting results
so do many other creams
not the product for this price
i wanted something light weight for the upcoming summer months
on days i need more coverage i use a bb cream over it
i figure anything with that strong of a scent can not be healthy for my skin
it did reduce the depth of those under my eyes
it smells seriously gross
sepora needs to do better in quality control when sending out items in their playbox
thought for my next round i would try the vineactive mainly b/c my skin tends to get used to something
i might as well have been using a no name face cream
what a complete waste of my money!
i prefer the the other lines over this one
since i rely on reviews for products
there are other products that share a similar light consistency without the horrid scent
like the formula of this
this one in particular doesn't make the cut for me
more each time to compensate
the product itself is fine
so bonus points there
the new formula is not to my liking
so bonus points there
i would not repurchase
i wouldn't recommend every day use
which is all right
which has no proven benefit to skin
this one i'm aware of the scent all day
i can purchase something different
i would recommend just buying a cheaper alternative
you can go to health store
i add this product into my foundation
as someone who is really into home remedies
you are strictly paying for the gold
gold has no health benefits when used in this manner
i ordered it as soon as it was available
don't buy into this
according to the bottle this product is supposed to have a 12 month shelf life
makes me question the quality of ingredients
there are so many organic face oils out there that are 1/4 the price
can be used the exact same way as this "elixir"
that single use of an expensive oil is not reason enough to hang on to this
it does not fight age lines or age spots
i tend to reach for my other oils more
after applying it on the skin or adding it with my foundation
maybe this will work for other skin types
i got this product as as a trial to see what the hype was all about for this product
you would get the same results from using jojoba oil
i even put it on my lips as seen in many instagram tutorials
applied foundation on i don't see a difference
so of course i saw this all over social media
one can diy this at home at a fraction of the price
i hope this review helps someone save money.
pumpkin seed oil are the only worthwhile ingredients in the product
with all due respect
i hope they reformulate this.
i do not want to risk future breakouts through the use of this product
can only speak from my own personal experience
the salesperson at sephora told me it may be used a as a primer
there are much better primers available
this is a waste of moneys.
i will try the gold.
tried this a variety of ways
a lot of people are comparing it to water
the ingredients are junk
the only time i breakout from products is when they are filled with a bunch of garbage ingredients
we both purchased the item.
this is purely hype
please do research before purchasing any products with your hard earned money- this just won't cut it
your customers are getting more intelligent with their purchases
don't see the benefits of it
i buy a lot of different products to test
or one that gains its popularity
notoriety primarily by relying on ig / youtube influencers to push their products
none of whom actually perform actual product testing
it has been advertised primarily as a "primer"
as skin care as it reads on the package
the rest of the ingredient list is filler.
i don't think this is effective to warrant a high price tag
there's no ingredient in here that warrants the price tag
it is no different than applying water
this product is a sham.
there is no difference short term or long term
it is a complete waste of money.
will not be repurchasing.
i wish both were out of stock because it is absolute garbage
will not be reordering
the only pro on this product is the smell.
would give zero stars if possible
i found it to have no skin benefits
there are other primers out there
assumed that this was a great product based on these facts
my main issue was the fact that i paid $54 for it
the company reached out to me personally with tips on how to avoid blurry vision
i like a lot of their products
you might want to use a separate eye makeup remover with this
i do appreciate that the product is natural
i wanted to say that although it says to use a plentiful amount
if you choose to use it that way
i wholeheartedly recommend anyone try their masks
i can name several creams that do a better job for a fraction of the cost
i am not recommending to use it
just look at the ingredients list
this new product is
i truly miss the discontinued day
i didn't to apply powder at all with this product
i got this specifically for the high levels of spf
this new formula is a lot like that
would be great for winter or nighttime
just to confirm that the new formulation is indeed different
while the product did work fine as overall primer i did not see any pore blurring or vanishing as promised in the product description
the ingredients is not listed anywhere !!
purchased it hoping the ingredient list would be good
etc it also has added perfume
that was my main reason for buying it
expecting it to be a simple repackaging
this is also a more expensive product for lower quality product
i hoping to make sure beauty enthusiasts will not be duped into thinking this is the same product or some kind of upgrade
cleanser did not meet my expectations
i did enjoy using this product.
but this is no 'pore extractor' as it claims.
now for my dislikes
thankfully most of them are at the end of the list
too expensive to use on a daily basic :(
should not be advertised as such
besides that i would have given it 5.
t requires a lot of product to cover your face
i think there are better products with overall value
i also had high hopes for this face masks.
just because i'mnot "selling" your products!
the product description said it would remove makeup
the hunt continues for me.
which i think defeats the purpose
with so many other br
the only feature i liked is the fact that it comes in two pieces
this one was difficult to unfold
comes with the package
no lasting results or claim to 'clear skin'
i won't repurchase it
i probably wouldn't repurchase due to the higher price tag compared to other sheet masks
i think there are better products on the market that beat this lane for sure
this product had no results on my skin one way or the other
this could be better al
i love trying new masks
this mask did not provide the hydration that my skin needed
this could be better al
i got this product because one of the ladies in he store recommended it for hydration
which are about half the price
the product on the other h
this one functions okay
the results of the two step application process seems similar to normal one step face masks
would have purchased again if the price was cheaper
i also live in a place with high humidity so that may make a difference as well
otherwise i'd look for an alternative
it isn't life changing
i continued with applying my foundation
for the price i was hoping for added benefits
3 stars for the product that might work for some
did feel great upon initial application
if anyone out there has the same skin type i would be cautious about spending $$$ on this product
for the price point
be amount of product that there is
i've bought comparable moisturizers for less than the market price with about three times the product in the packaging
i gave it a try because other reviews with similar skin types to mine were saying how amazing it was for their skin
i can add this to the list of products that don't work
unfortunately i don't have any positive outcomes from this product
unlike her other products
i usually have good luck with serums with similar ingredients/claims
it was the only new addition to my routine
the newer ones just don't stack up
the fact that it triggered a headache makes me need to return
figured this would be similar
the product does work well
i think i would try other oils before i repurchase this one
i used my bi points to purchase the sample wish i could've continued to use it to see if the results would be great
i cannot recommend this
think it may have been the coconut ingredient
love most of the other de products though!
i love all of their other products
for such a high price point
there is nothing special about it to justify the price either
have repurchased many of their products several times
will repurchase until i die
this, however, is the exception.
when i applied both of these products in my house with the air-conditioning on
how they can be effective
i hope it works for others
the right amount is dispensed without waste.
i hope it can work well for others
i like the way it is packaged
don't waste your money on this product.
this was a complete waste of my money
this is a pointless purchase bubble technology or not
i've liked several other things from the de line
i like the overall idea behind this cleanser
- i even like the packaging.
my issue is mainly with the packaging.
with no other cap for security
yet the product still leaks?
i'd save my money on this
my only problem is that the packaging leaks everywhere
de please fix this one flaw
i think the foaming part might be the issue
or wait for the click
were working on a new design
the problem with it is the package.
the rest of the de packaging is so clever
i gave this basically an average of our two reviews
this does an okay job removing most makeup- only some difficulty with eye makeup which is to be expected
won't repurchase this product.
since i have a lot of other cleansers i prefer over this one
i did not have any leakage problems with the packaging
it was difficult to dispense the product
use several items from their line
it does not separate from the bottle
it is a "click-2-close" mechanism with the opening on the bottom of the cleanser
i will be returning this product because the packaging is not safe for travel
i cannot risk having it leak all the time
the real problem i have with this cleanser is that as it is in a stick form
they were in every conceivable place in my bathroom
which they don't disclose in any material
one issue is that this br
i consider this false advertising.
i will not repurchase
costs the same amount as one
or more depending on what you buy
for the price of it
the amount of actual product is disappointing for the price
didn't hesitate to buy this when it became available to everyone
the price you pay is way to high for the amount of product you receive
will not be repurchasing.
i might not have used the correct amount
it is so tiny that it looks like it should be in the bins by the cashiers for an impulse buy
it isn't any different than their other masks.
was fun to try but will not be repurchased.
i am keeping it for collectible purpose it serves
i cant imagine the benefits outweigh the smell
you need a lot of product for coverage
t's hard to comment on the effectiveness
i highly recommend you do that instead of purchasing this
however if i had a skin emergency
had really high hopes considering the price
like many of the other reviewer's
don't buy this without selling it first.
do not purchase this product if you are looking to replace a different
i need something more industrial for evening
i won't be reordering
i would not recommend due to that fact.
on the other h
the reason i won't repurchase
you end up using their cheap plastic holder to store
my disappointment comes from the longevity of the product
for the price i don't know that it makes fiscal sense to repurchase
i am keeping this one.
it is difficult to find a place to store it between uses
i love when companies are innovative
i enjoy using this
i am sure that per "ounce" of product is very expensive compared to the traditional pump cleanser
use i think i prefer the traditional pump
two stars because i like the product.
i might as well not use a cleanser at all.
my suggestion is to pass on this one
at any rate, i won't be repurchasing it.
i've tried other fresh products before that i like
especially if you are applying this prior to makeup application
received the travel size as a promotion for this product
yet spent the most money on
for those of you who don't know fragrance is mainly comprised of alcohol
my search still continues.
maybe the company could make a perfume like this in the future?
i promise there is nothing special about this product
decided to try out one of their own products
i love trying new face masks
considering the price tag
admittedly i ordered this to get on the trend train
then follow up with a moisturizer or cream that is dependent on what i need to address
than i look online to find people who have ph tested this cleanser
this is such a fail for me.
uses it on all of her clients
the instructions say to use 5 or 6 drops to cover the entire face
because i have to use more drops than recommended
i can already see that this serum will be used up very fast
nothing special about it
it might be great for anti-aging
for the price i feel like it should have delivered more
with all of the bells
i continued to use it for a month as a realize that it can take time for skin to adjust to some products
i'll give it two stars because it is easy to use
to make sure it wasn't the other new products that were breaking me out
not sure why the description says it does not contain propylene glycol when it is listed as the fourth ingredient?
this product did not firm or tighten my skin
bought this online because sephora does not offer the hope is not enough serum that they carry in the store
it seemed to do the opposite of what it advertises
just want to end with the note that i almost 100% of the time agree with the majority of the reviewers on sephora on the products i buy
might be different for others.
i also wish this were packaged in a container other than a jar
the reason why i gave this an average rating is because personally
upon further inspection it's far from
if you look passed these two factors
you go further down the ingredient list
i think i'm alone in holding this opinion
for me the absolute deal breaker is the scent.
i think the marketing
nothing special or out of the ordinary
nothing special about it at all.
therefore this was a total waste of money.
fair results given the price of the product
not as effective as i had hoped in removing makeup
the reviews for the water bank cream were high
i received this product for free via influenster.
i tend to use a lot of glamglow products
on the other h
i received this item for free on influenster for testing purposes
none of these ingredients should be applied to your face
definitely not usable as an am cream
you get a lot of product for the price
this seems to be the culprit
this moisturizer did not fit in that category.
i tried 4 different types
other brands need to do that.
i love every single one of them
i don't have long term thoughts
it's common that some aren't all that effective
whether a natural source or not
see if my opinion of it improves
as per the instructions
lives up to its claims with continued use
i don't think it had enough results to warrant the high price tag
this product is a pass for me.
as this product description
one of the claims from this product is that it gives an instant
for the price of this product
overall, this isn't a must have.
i plan on using it on days i'll be spending a lot of time outdoors
i will continue to use this product
origins products have always been over priced
for those who don't normally use foundation
i just wish it provided more coverage
i chose the color fair
which is one way i pick a product
for that price tag
thanks to this product i do now
i would pass on buying this product.
i don't have many lines to improve
the product is supposed to show results in 7 days
i've never expected to use a skin care product
i would not purchase with my own money
while using clarins double serum i had no issues in that area what so ever
i feel i would have to use at least half a bottle or a whole bottle to see aging benefits
i would apply it at night
i received this product free for testing purposes by influenster
although this may be the firming properties at work
i would recommend sampling this product before purchasing if you have sensitive skin or are bothered by fragrances
thanks influenster for allowing me to give this product a try
*i received a 7 day supply for free from influenster in exchange for my review of this product
i receive this product for free for testing purposes from influenster
i received this product for free from influenster
use a different product instead
i did get this for free for testing purposes.
no, unless it were cheaper.
it did not deliver any of the products claims
at least give decent size samples so customers can see if it works over a couple of weeks
it did live up to being lightweight
this product was annoying that it made such claims
i do use this and the line release.
i just wish they hadn't included the fragrance which is very high on the ingredient list
i found that the majority of all the great reviews were left by employees of the company or their friends
they're using the same marketing strategy on sephora reviews
i work in marketing also
there is nothing customers trust more than other customer reviews
i think it will suit all skin types.
it may be different for you.
i should note that my skin is combination.
have to be cautious as to what i layer on top of it
unfortunately the cons outweigh the pros so therefore i will be returning this product
the results from the product are fine
decided to use it to completion before choosing to replenish or not
definitely supported cell turnover on my skin
so i will not be repurchasing.
if it keeps showing results, i can deal.
i would not repurchase at the original price for the following reasons:- the texture is light
this is probably just personal preference
while i apply it
i kept having all these breakouts as a result.
i need something extra
i find that if i don't apply the right products to my skin
i didnt find this cleanser to be any more or less cleansing than other products
this is not for combination skin
it was a waste of money
it will not take off any of your more durable eye make-up
i like the fact that it is natural
i don't see any special results
expected more from this product
wear makeup on a daily basis this may not be the best product
works well but not over the top.
i am constantly searching for a better product
it was also because of this that i had to use more of this product
i used up this product before all the others in the kit will not repurchase
same issues with those
got it in the sephora reward perk.
it looks about the same
this product may live up to all of its claims
for the same price or lower
i would re purchase if i had limited options
on the other h
the idea behind this product
this is a deal breaker for me.
will look for another product
when it has this product
it was such a waste
if you're combination like me it will only increase your oilyness
instructions say to use this
i wont be repurchasing due to the pilling
i like the formula
the way it applies
i got mine as a 100 point prize from the rewards
please update your ingredients list to match the new formula
the ingredients on the new bottle/package are not the same as the ones listed on the website
other ingredients that were higher on the sephora/ole henriksen website
the fragrance is now higher on the list than the orange
there is now alcohol in this product
i no longer trust this brand.
i suspect that this product has a very short shelf life
not for the price
the chance of a repeat experience
i would advise any individual suffering from acne to stay away
i like the packaging
couldn’t recommend it more for those with combination skin like mine
even seems to help with my break out frequency
this is a waste of money
i would recommend it
i would also say to keep your expectations realistic because it's a solid serum
i decided to search the ingredients
as i do not use it closely enough
hard to apply on the face
no matter how small amount i apply
ask for a refund or exchange because it has been a while
i change to another product
i usually get a wow feeling after testing most of their products
i can see how the scent can be offensive
switched to another line of products
the consistency is very similar
i'll hope for results to match the price
it was so greasy it was impossible to apply foundation over it
makes make-up application impossible
what i can speak of is the heavy
i applied a ton of products
definitely prefer the renewed version.
they no longer sold the sensitive version
i would use this product
they have changed the formula.
the bottle itself is now cheap
now i have to look for a new moisturizer
this product is rated "high" overall by ewg
my skin does not respond well to new formula
when you apply on a skin
the product would receive 4-5 starts from me
i get the same effect with other br
s reputation i expected a lot
i personally would not repurchase this
texture of this is not good-- i would not recommend buying this product online--go to store to smell
this is a good moisturizer if you can get use to the consultancy
it is such a poor product for me
will not be repurchasing
i will not repurchase.
i wouldn't recommend this product.
also use a number of other philosophy products.
i like other philosophy products like their cleanser
determined that philosophy's hope in a jar would be the best given all the great reviews
i found that i had to use a lot of product to spread it on my face the way i wanted to to
i think i'll try renewed hope in a jar as it appears to be fragrance-free
i wouldn't recommend this product
i hope it works for other folks
when i apply it this is all i can smell
does not protect my skin like the previous version
will consider repurchasing when number one skin concern is anti-aging
overall, it is an average product.
if that's possible at all
really had high hopes for this product
with the hope for some anti aging benefits as well
it simply has not had a substantial enough effect on me for me to consider repurchasing
'm certain out was the product
i would not repurchase this product since it was not effective at all
will not be repurchasing
i will not be repurchasing
i'll use it up, but will not repurchase.
that was the extent of the benefits
i see no effects of the product
a less costly product will do the same
the description of the product
hence the three stars.
had really high hopes for this product when a sales person recommended this
though i find this product effective
i also do not feel the moisture that it claims to provide
i expected this to be a holy grail product
its better to buy some lemon instead.
initially when i apply it
seems to have some benefit
considering the price of this
i only use it in the am
although i applied it correctly
they had other products that they recommended
it is the exact opposite that i asked for.
i love so many other fresh products
there is not a lot of product in the packaging for the price
this mask is nothing special
i feel like this is a basic clay mask you could buy from a health food store for $8
i received this product for free in exchange for my honest opinion
i will try to find other alternatives
i found for me with the bar you can control the consistency of the mask
will definitely be purchasing after i use up some of my other masks
which i was not aware of when purchasing
i am comparing this to caudalie's sorbet which suits me more
use this product with caution....
also give a something extra
this one is no exception
i think i would prefer a product with less fragrance
i love other caudalie products
other than that there is nothing special about it
that defeats the purpose isn't it?
but will likely not repurchase.
you should rename this product as it cleanses nothing
i used the entire bottle to give it an honest try
t used to say "non comedigenic" on the package
i won't be repurchasing in the future
you want to use this before you use an actual cleanser
it just does a fair job of removing my makeup
it would take multiple efforts
i will be changing brands.
save your money and research a better cleanser.
please bring back original perfect cleansing milk
i don't like this new
this was partially my fault for not reading the instructions earlier on on how to properly use it--which is to use with a cotton pad to remove make up
now i have to experiment
then all the packaging changed
the sales person said that others had similar complaints
now this new formula is completely different
i need to look for another product to replace this with
not your new generation
the sales person assured me that the new bottle had the same formula
this is not possible
i believe it is due to the oil in this product
if you want to bring a new product to the line
i will be forced to use a different br
i'll now be hunting for a new cleanser as this doesn't meet the caudalie st
caudalie has been reformulating some of their products
looks like the search will continue.
they changed their formula
i prefer the original formula
i may be forced to change brands.
no stars for being an actual cleanser
will such for a better moisturizer first instead
i would recommend trying out the fresh line
bought this thinking it'll clear up all my existing acne
you don't need to apply a lot of product
or people that use retin-a
i wish i could exchange it for a better product
use so many boscia products
i got this specifically for the spot treatment because those are the kind of blemishes i usually get
is a complete waste of money
i trusted them with this "new" product.
i would have rated it four stars for that
which taints the remaining product in the tip for future use
i don't believe i'll repurchase this one
when i apply this on it
will probably use this for daytime though
i like the design of the treatment a lot.
you just twist the bottom to release the product.
it may be more effective for those with acne that can hurt as the description says it provides relief
i also found the packaging to be hard to work with
had such high hopes.
only one twist of product each time
the product may or may not work.
most treatments that i use work to some extent
i like how this is a 'natural' alternative
had high hopes for this product
but it was a waste of money.
people said that works for acne
the ingredients just aren't active enough.
in comparison to similar products on the market
it may have helped some in the prevention of acne
it seems like a complete waste of my money.
the search goes on...
or have to waste because of delivery issues
as a long time consumer
clearly the customer comes last with boscia.
there are other great products that offer similar results
since the expectation was high
this is the product
i will continue to use this
doesn't deliver as advertised
i do think this product is effective
with further investigation i found out this was in fact a moisturizer
don't buy this one!
i would like to try some of the other overnight korres products
i kept assuming it was other products
this was the common factor
using this products made me breakout
other products i've tried from korres though
i needed a new face wash
the ingredients in this cleanser are nothing short of appalling
use this product no problem
this product is way overhypes!
had to use a tatcha product to combat what this product couldn't take off
i enjoy philosophy's other products
i want to try different ones
it will always have a special place in my memory
plus every single time i use it
doesn't compare to any of the other benefit products
if i use this product in the shower
this is an exact match
another one of those products i don't underst
i also find it difficult to get the product out of the bottle
based on the number of high scoring reviews maybe i'm the one with the problem?
not sure what happened as it used to be formulated different
despite the fact that this says 'all in one'
this was nothing special
this product was included in my monthly play!
i can use other products that cost a lot less
my conclusion is that i will not be repurchasing
i think the cleansing properties were average
may need to change to something different
serves its purpose of trying to renew skin
it serves only this purpose
no tube in the bottle for the pump as others have mentioned
i'd recommend saving yourself the trouble
go with a different br
he said i'd see "instant results".
i didnt fully like this product
my problem with it is
is it the product or the fact that my skin is beyond help?
i wish there were more detiled instructions---should i use a toner first---how about a moistureizer over it??
otherwise i will continue to use it.
there are better or at least equivalent products for half the price
most of the reviews associated with this product are for a former version
after having high hopes for this expensive product i will not be repurchasing
this is a complete waste of money
using the product exactly as directed
am still on the hunt for a remedy
bought this along with other dermadoctor products for my acne-prone skin
i expected more with its expensive price tag.
it can work for people with no skin concerns.
hence the 3 instead of 5 stars
my skin remains the same
i will return for refund.
not been as effective as i hoped it would be based on the other reviews
monthly mailed-to-your-home skin care kits
at this point i'm undecided as to whether i'd spend the money to get another jar
the reason i gave it 3 stars is the packaging
i see there is still the pump mechanism to get through
since it is not a cheap product
could provide more attention to fine lines
over priced based on performance.
can tell if there is improvement as compared to my right eye
i buy eye cream all the time
hoping for some kind of breakthrough
when i pay $60 for a product
i am on the fence about this product
would encourage you to try it for yourself
waste of money for us older women i think
it is quite a hassle adding another step to my daily routine
i do wish the price was lower
so that may be the culprit
had high hopes for this product.
price and value not a match
because it is easy to apply
which is how long it will take me to erode the brick fully
not effective at all
find it at your local health or bulk food store
i would always have to follow up with an actual cleanser
effort trying to make it work for me in various ways
i might use this for travel
i just don't think the coverage of clay on my face is effective
s instead of my face
it didn't help clear breakouts or prevent new ones
for the price, it wasn't justified.
you can get more for your money at a health store that sells vitamins
for the price of this product, i expected more.
'm not referring to a current purchase
provided the formula hasn't changed this should still help
it does deliver on that.
try applying it to your face
cleaning your face should not be this difficult :
had high hopes for this product
no specific complaints about my skin
nothing like the current product i use
i would say it is similar to philosophy's purity cleanser
would not be purchasing.
you get a lot of product for a fair price
unlike a lot of other masks
i will continue to use it
it also has a really cooling effect that was so extreme i considered washing it off right then
use it alse on yourself
unacceptable ingredient for such a high end product
it just feels like a treat to apply at the end of the day
although i love other clarins products
the only positive quality if the cleanser is that it is not drying at all on my skin
clarins exclusive cleansing method is too much hassle for me
i can put a primer on
one day without any makeup
can we get this fragrance free?
prime powder my t zone to avoid this
overall i'd skip this purchase.
illuminating primer for the same outcome
use a lot of their products
it did nothing for me in keeping my oily areas matte compared to various other moisturizers i've used recently which promised no matteifying effect
100% not for all skin types
this one is average
any morning i use this
i may try to use it as a hand lotion instead?
i thank sephora for letting us sample these products for instances like these
it would take several months to actually know whether or not it is successful at treating pigmentation
am doubtful about whether to purchase given the obscene price
may investigate one of those sources when this runs up
for the amount of money, i expected more.
it worked the same as any other product out there
everything it claims to do i already have solid holy grail products for
try this product as a sample before committing to the real deal
i wouldn't recommend this product.
its main flaw for me was how tacky it was.
just to ensure that this product was in fact the single reason for the reaction
i want to encourage people to try it for themselves
form their own opinion
however according to the description
i would rather spending money on another brand
you use a normal amount
please has anyone used it
the texture of the product i received from my online order was different than the texture of the one in the store
i don't find it as good as my clinic products
i did some research
it seems to have no anti-aging or other properties
i will not be repurchasing it in the future
as they look any other day
this concentrate has nothing to do with that
you wouldn't see results if you were younger coz this is designed for older
the formula seemed the same
there is supposed to be some kind of "miracle" plant extract in this eye cream
it is a bunch of hype with no supporting research
i don't trust a review for an eye cream if the person is under 35
this review is specifically for the sole purpose of helping dark circles
this was a costly product to see no results.
the 'disappearing act' with no benefits is a waste of time
this product is as good as any other in that price range
i think i'll try other primers before becoming a repeat buyer
then i apply my primer.
purchased this since it calls itself "the ultimate pick me up" i use it in the morning
i see no difference between using this
make up does apply well over it
i've applied it exactly as directed
i will not be purchasing
i chose this as one of my 100 point perks.
unforfunately i cannot use it.
why why why the need for these foul strong scents in our beauty products?
i work in the beauty industry
have tried so many other products that really give you an instant 'wow' when applied
you are probably used to a price like this
it should not be listed as a moisturizer
for the price i was expecting to see more results
i expected more from this based on the description
will not be repurchasing
that it works as well as any drugstore br
does not fulfill all of its promises
i won't purchase this again as there are several other face washes out there that work well for a much lower price
this could be the result of washinin gmy face 2x a day eitherway
it will be the purchase of this cleanser
my goal was to use this products to remove my makeup at night as well as to treat my combination skin
on the other h
you need a ton of it per use
will also keep looking
t to their long time customers
just think this is too harsh for the general population
i will return product
not at all like the other products
i can see this working
which was good in terms of the moisture it provided
'm hoping the hype of murad's pore treatment follows through
i can easily remove them with the tool i also purchased from sephora
shouldent have wasted the time or money
i am 21 with combination
i hope is nothing permanent :|
perhaps the product inside has also
before you can use even a fraction of the product
i will no longer be using
now i can only apply it in select areas of my face
this product was just average.
with the same packaging
rich that i cannot use it in the morning
i would give it a higher score
it says in the description on the bottle that it is reccommended for that use due to its cooling properties
can't speak for its moisturing or other properties
wanted it for cooling purposes only.
would welcome a reccomendation for any other product that would do the job
doesn't have the same citrus-type sent that i like about the day product
seems like a waste of money at the price
along with several other murad products
this was recommended in the store as a product that would address these things
lines are the same
it is an average moisturizer for the price
also provide no real hydration at the same time
i would never buy this lotion despite all of its supposed perks
pet peeve: products that are so multi-functional that they miss the mark
i put it in storage in case i will go skiing
it should be good for customers after the age of 40
was told as long as i used a water based moisturizer underneath it would be fine
i would recommend getting samples before you commit to purchasing
don't think this product is suitable for my skin type
most of his products including some from this line
it was only average
now i'm having to wear liquid
this one is no exception.
i know i need to wear a 30 or higher
i don't see why this lotion costs more than twice what the other lotion costs
i think the price needs to be lowered.
definitely will not buy it at this high of a price
the price is a lot
continue to burn for a while
s offer products that do the same thing for half the price
the change in ingredients is not listed on the sephora website
it isn't oil-free
it should work well under makeup
t was suitable for putting on in the morning before my makeup
i wanted to like this product because of the high spf
i won't be repurchasing
which was not listed on the website
i may still look for other products
that she uses the product
thanks to sephora's generous return policy i figured i would try it
unwrapped the new package i noticed that this new product also had the undesirable smell
divided the cost by 5
nothing seems to help those so thus product won't be rated on that
it's probably better suited for someone in their mid 20's that is starting a preventive routine
for helping me and made me to buy it !!!!
expected more for the price!
told by consultant that it would help strengthen the skin under my eyes
i specifically said i needed something for my dark circles
as far as a general
i'll start by saying that i love dermadoctor products
because she says it was fragrance free
the other selling point for me was that she made a comment about how the jar was huge
kind of believe its due to this product
i will rate this higher if after a month or 2 the product gets better
this is a costly $73 waiting game.
at that price - no thanks.
still like the store
i apply it every morning and night.
the only pros of this cream are that it is rich
beyond that, it's all cons.
i paid $75 for this product
asked about the ingredients
on the main description page it explicitly states "what it is formulated without: parabens
i will email the company as well to correct this error
this product started burning my skin before i could benefit from any of the possible positive outcomes outlined in the product description
this stuff costs over $70
please before you buy this get a sample because you will be wasting your money
each time i pump it
the only problem is the price.
i would try out other products from this lines
i wouldn't repurchase this particular product
especially not after taking the price
ing in either direction compared to the other masks i have in my rotation
go put those money into better use such as an investment account or something
not looking any different
you can get as good or better at your local drugstore
there are quite a few anti-aging superstars on the ingredient list
so when i apply foundation
i would rather spend this money to get a perricone md basic finished cream
there was no other br
for the high price
i wanted to fall in love with it because the label says it has peptides
i would have preferred a richer eye cream for my age group
at least decrease some of the lines
not a fan, won't repurchase.
cant apply makeup over top of this
then they changed the packaging
i couldn't justify spending a few dollars more on an inferior product
it is a nice product for winter since i use it in combination with the other korres greekyoghurt collection
this is the only thing i've found that works
very reasonable price and it actually works!
i asked the sales rep there for recommendation under $50
taking the iq skin test
when you first apply it
at a lower price point
should not have been packaged in a pot
i did not notice any lifting/ firming after a full bottle's use
i wish it would have worked better for my particular skin type
a good, basic pm eye cream, though!
i would recommend it as an eye cream
don't think i will repurchase
while i'm a fan of philosophy in general
i decided to purchase this product
i decided to check the ingredients before ordering
then charges ridiculously high prices for an ingredient that is cheap as dirt
will check you ingredient list from now on before purchasing your products
now i am rethinking it
i won't be buying any of their products
this may be for a younger demographic
i feel like i had to apply additional pressure with my finger vs other face creams i have tried
is not on this site
save the money for something that works
more for preventative measures than anything else
i would recommend the eye
any benefits from the product will be overshadowed by the damage done through the application process
nothing special about this one except the high price
so the key is to be consistent
if you want a more permanent solution
after 4-6 weeks you will see a difference in the reduction of the fine lines
the main key is to use these products every day to see the difference they can make
you won't see the full effects these products can deliver
i think there are other products that do more for the same price or less
i will no longer be using this soap
my other clinique products work well
its great for travel if you don't want to bring a liquid
along with the other two steps
nothing special about it
the acne treating one did the same
i've found other products i prefer
would help with fine lines
i will not be repurchasing.
i also use clinique 3 step
feel neutral about the whole experience
it is not easy to apply
i expected this product to do as it said it would do: firm
i apply both morning and night.
i wish companies would stop listing these amazing results their products give
not likely a future purchase
the product will definetly firm your eye area while drying you skin out in the process
i tend to use this at night
actually prefer that one to this anti-gravity
i am rating it two stars because i also used the product
i don't recommend this product
he said this one is strong smell of alcohol
finally had to switch to something with a lower alcohol content
like others have said
making your skin feel like it will split
moisturizer directly after is a must.
i am currently alternating it with another cleanser just to use it up
feels great-a permanent addition to my routine now
when i apply the product it feels like i just applied water
everyone has different skin it may work for others
this product was not the successful on my bags.
bought it having high hopes for at least decent moisturizer
for the cost i expected more
use it every single day
i personally would not pay full price for this.
not working for my eye issues
if i'm paying for an eye cream
still in the market of seeking better eye creams.
overall though, i would not repurchase this.
the price was so reasonable
i find this product to be average.
00 i expected something because drug store br
i also don't like its container.
it seems to be working
while it claims to be scent free
it feels like the same lotion they have for women
because it was recommended for my combination skin
i would recommend it.
decided to try other products
then apply to the skin
i think the product offers a lot for it's price
i will not be repurchasing
i like your price point
s that cost alot less that is exactly similar to this
my korres products are far superior
if you like natural products this is for you.
that the price is a bit high
considering you have to use it often to get the full effect
if the price was lower
and that price tag though.
i will continue to use it
won't be purchasing this
i would not purchase this
will not repurchase it
my other rose items are made in france.
you know when buying fresh you are getting high quality ingredients
i don't plan to repurchase it at the price point.
i did apply the mask
would i recommend it for the price?
the hydration was never permanent
i would not purchase this product
i will not try any more fresh products
i immediately discontinued use
yet i invested in this moisturizer assuming that the "experts" at lancome would have kept this in consideration during the design
development phase of this product
although i cannot find a full ingredient list online
i will review the ingredients listed on the container
plus the benefits that the product offered were hard to overlook as well
f you have similar skin this may not be for you
she informed me that a lot of lancomes products cause people to break out because of the fragrances they add in their products
some days i would apply it very often throughout the day
for a product whose name means "well done
" this moisturizer did not meet my expectations
definitely not recommended for those who live in cities where faces are already chapped from the environment
means that my once two-step cleansing process is now three-step
might try the other formula
on my closed eyes for a fair amount of time
now i have to deal with the after effects
i will not repurchase!
while this one is a one time deal
plus the price point is crazy for such a basic item
this is one of them
gave it the benefit of the doubt
this packaging is a failure though.
for every use or pump of the product
i suggest sampling before purchasing because i notice i'm not the only one here who had this experience
i recommend finding a product that is more efficient for this kind of money
its nothing special other than the spf
just carefully apply it and its fine.
the product may as well work
i would not be purchasing this product in the future
should have known that before purchasing
there are better options at lower price points.
the only highlight of this product probably is its formulas
this one- i apply foam
which i have both of
the predict details also say it helps with blemishes
i don't feel as if i'm committed or will accept this as part of my regimen
likely won't repurchase either.
will go back to other reliable cleansers that are less expensive
she told it on the all natural ingredients.
found it did an adequate job
i'll be trying out other caudalie products though
i find i have to use 3 instead of the 2 pumps i would normally use with other cleansers
this is my question if it is a 3-day shipping like it says on the site than how july 7 to july 13 is considered a 3-day shipping
standard shipping is 5-7 days.
it said 3-day shipping!!
on the other h
i got the product having high hopes
i feel like you can purchase a drug store cleanser that works the same
everyone has a different experience
risk the same reaction
i will continue to repurchase that
with the same results
except for the price
there was nothing special about it
still undecided as to whether to try the "very mild" or just try a whole new other product
it's only now that i'm in my 20s that acne has become a part of my life
i will not be re-purchasing this product
i found this to be a very basic
i did not like the ingredient list or smell.
it did the exact same thing in less than a week
i won't be repurchasing
i find that it's effective
i like to try new products
i discontiuned use of this product
same messy results each time.
1/2 with no primer at all
maybe my skin is just not compatible with this primer
i suspect this product is ideal for fair
in any other situation i recommend that people with brown skin should try this on at the store before buying it to determine if the shade works with your particular shade of brown
i don't feel the price is worth switching over permanently
then apply my foundation
i've tried so, so many different brands.
if you hesitating between this product or for an example benefits porefessional
will continue to use it
the consistency is different
t multiple times through their website
the search is on for a replacement product.
a free $85 bonus little set if you spent a certain amount on dr br
it was the same consistency
please fix this issue
can continue to use this product
while on the hunt for the perfect pore blurring company for my face- i tried out about 6 different products all claiming to the the same thing
for the price i don't think it is something extra ordinary
will try to find a cheaper n better option.
the other side had no primer
will not be buying this product
because i otherwise would have purchased this product
it was a waste of money
this bottle looks like it should hold 3-4 times the volume that it does
it does its job
i discontinued its use immediately.
the packaging is hiding that there is only a tinyyyyy amount of product
which is not only a superior product
perhaps some other br
s before deciding to repurchase this or not
i'll try other cleansers before repurchasing
i won't buy it any more
for the amount i paid, i was expecting more...
it generally did nothing else to my skin after continuous use
i plan to stop using this one
one way or the other
i don't see any added benefits from using it
i would not recommend applying it to the eye area
if you like rose in general
the only reason i gave this product 2 star instead of 1 star is because it's good for using as a h
i got this product through the korres rose collection without any intentions of purchasing it beforeh
i rarely return items
the other problem i had was the scent.
it was not suitable for mine
i don't see any skin improvements after using this
i wanted to try a newproduct line so with help from the sales consultant
f you are planning on using this for all over blemishes
buying the peel pads since those work absolute wonders
the results were not reflective for us.
overall rating i would have to say
at first i like that it is silicon-based
additional moisturizer just sits on top of it
if you use this product you can not mix with any other as it cause piling
it does it without other products as well
are by no means gone
i expected better results for the price
which can be tough to deal with
it also made my face
i could 4 jars of my preferred cream that has never caused my skin to breakout
unless lancôme have changed the ingredients to it
overal expensive for what it does
it should be a miracle cream for this price.
i will switch to the bienfait eye cream from lancome that does the same thing
i know the price looks steep
f you use 2 drops a day it will cost less than $2 per day
i do like most fresh products
comes in the exact same bottle
either way was not effective
overall i would not recommend this product!
i feel like the name of the product is so false
will continue to use their products forever
will not repurchase this.
recently i find myself using numerous pumps of product to remove just basic daily makeup
generally i still follow with the clinque bar soap
this is one of the few clinique products that i do not recommend
i hope not all the sephora employees were instructed to say it is safe to use on the eyes
might be better to buy clinique at a clinique counter
is this product save to use?
it is specifically created to only remove makeup from the face
i tried this out after not being able to purchase my usual dual phase oil version of this product
it wasn't available at the one near my hotel
the sephora sales person told me this is a "all in one" meaning it could double as cleanser
i will not recommend puchase this item.
i rarely return items
this product says it is for all skin types
i expected the same kind of results from this
use this for my face
i like the spf protection that this product provided
thus can not comment on how well it works
ithe effect seemed to be only very temporary
it does however provide a certain temporary comfort to the skin due to hydration
as i am not willing to spend $200+ for their high-end line
just in a new packaging
if you are fair skinned
the product itself is fine
this product did nothing beneficial for my skin
looking at the ingredients
i strongly believe if i continue using this product
overall i like this purchase.
this was recommended to me for fine lines
not worth the price tag for the other issues i experienced
nonetheless, i won't be buying the full product.
ideally that would be a good thing
otherwise, save your money!
i gave it the extra star because it comes with an independent applicator
if your main concern is hydration then this is a great eye cream for that
what's the use of using a cream that will work for now
but it is not suitable for me.
petroleum are way up in the ingredients list
although i like shiseido products
i don't know if an active ingredient or the fragrance to blame
it was nothing special
every time i would apply it
better choice is the infusion concentrate
i won't be repurchasing, unfortunately.
i expect more from this brand.
i will be returning the product to the store
go for another products.
overall would not recommend it
it was a waste of money.
even though this is oil-free
i don't recommend this for combination skin
fresh's oil-free umbrian clay lotion is a viable alternative
despite the price tag
this is one of them
another products in the shiseido matifying line
i did not see an increase in breakouts
i think that is also the drawback
while i love the other products in the "pureness" line
very high content of alcohol in this product.
its not adding to my breakouts
won't be repurchasing this
i switched to this from the sk-ii line trying to save some money
hoped for the same results
as there are other
less expensive products i can use for that purpose
this is such big waste of money
wanted to give bio-performance a try.
i would not make any repeat purchases
i would use the mask
as others mentioned it does work well with a clarisonic
for the price, i was expecting more.
i no longer use this shiseido cleanser
this cleanser is not doing its primary job
steer clear of this one
even high-end ones
each will do their job
in the hopes of finding my holy grail product line
hoping the the whole purging theory was true
this new formula has no effect on skintone at all
i love shiseido products in general
as with all shiseido products
i am using all the lucent products together now
this product alone does not provide enough moisture or protection
the only thing i could think of to do is to apply a light lotion on first
this product would be it
not enough on the functionality
also, the packaging made it inconvenient to use.
now, the main annoying thing is the bottle.
hoping it could offer the protection i need through mild california winter
for the price i do not recommend purchasing it
i didn't test before purchasing
i concluded that this product is not for me
this is a product classic that needs an update.
does the job with no bells
no difference and a waste of money.
they are never effective.
maybe thats interfering with their effectiveness
which makes a difference in the long run
i'd say that this isn't the best product for someone who already has signs of aging under their eyes
for someone on the younger side who's looking to prevent those signs of aging
i would not recommend this applied to the eye lids
i wish i could at least have gained some moisture from this product
for me it was just a major waste of money
no results at all
i'll be comparing those two as well
i find it sufficient
was recommended for my type of skin
combination in other areas
there is nothing special about it
at the price it is
this product is for you
i think for the price
there are better options available
i really had high hopes for the product.
i find i'm using that more
these products made me break out
i wish the sales associates had more training
woiuld not recommend this product
before purchasing this product
that's the only product from this line that i am using
also, another problem...the price tag.
as those ingredients are not beneficial for your skin in any way
/or additional product removers afterwards
it seems different now
it refused to foam or spread or anything.
this is for you
i am keeping it
it is definitely not the best for make up removal
i may return it for another item in the line i do like ren products
i went into sephora the other day inquiring about a specific eye cream
i read the ingredients immediately only to see the second ingredient is an alcohol
should have no worries
to disregard options other than what a rep wants you to push
use a variety of their products
the consistency is no different from drug store kinds
hard to control actual amount you want to dispense
not cost effective for
on the other h
can get something similar to this at a drugstore.
i don't know if they have re-formulated
and i wanted a more natural product.
i do like the company
will continue to try other ren products
which is such a waste
the principle behind this product
this product works well
i asked for natural product
it must be some of the ingredients in there.
could not waste it for that price
i've done the same with other night creams
will not purchase it with my own $.
average hydration with not such an appealing scent-won't return
there are cheaper masks that do the same
love the results, although not permanent.
i don't see any addition benefits beyond just using a regular scrub
this is an average mask--i've used better
it does have a convenient dispenser though
some of which i made
you could squeeze the product out
also, it's a lot less product for the same price.
the packaging however is just asinine.
you need a lot of it in order to apply to the entire face
this is not safe for the eye area
why on earth would they change the packaging!!
love the product, hate the new packaging
at least with the older package i could cut the top off
shame on you, dermadoctor for inferior packaging.
the new packaging has majorly affected the way i'm able to use it
the actual product gets 5 stars
love the product, but hate the new packaging!
i hate the new pump bottle!
the old cleanser and new are exactly the same.
however, the new packaging is terrible.
the new is 6 oz.
the new packaging makes it impossible to actually pump any product out
am hoping they change to something that actually allows you to dispense this great product
if they wanted to reduce costs
i would give this cleanser a million stars if i could
the packaging makes it a three start product
this new packaging is ridiculous
or at least give us the option to choose between the bottle or the tube
one of the employees recommended this
i still get some new breakouts during the day
so my search continues...
i don't use it as directed
even drugstore options do better regardless of if i use my clarisonic or not
plus this product is in form of cream
this product might work for others
i would only recommend using this as a spot treatment
it is definitely not as effective as i assumed it would be due to the price
this product does contain a large amount of alcohol which is terrible for all skin types
not blaming this product
i would say it works as well as a drugstore br
efficiency seems the same
it also doesn't do well when applied with other products even with other products from this line
that you can find at any drug store for a much lower price
i've tried their other product 'porefection'
useless should have been the name
my breakouts while using products from this company are astounding
i continued to use the product to keep new breakouts at bay
i know a lot of people love the new formulation
it used to be fragrance free
the new formula made me break out
it seems like some of their formulas have changed
i will not repurchase.
won't be re-purchasing
it was so basic
a drugstore cleanser could give you the same results for a fraction of the price
i just got this product in hopes of replacing my current face wash
i will continue using it
this makes it difficult to apply
purchased this based on the recommendation of a sephora employee that it's great for sensitive skin
when the products works wonders
even though it is not listed in the ingredient list online
expensive for no results yet.
the closest store to me does not carry it
see if there is another comparable product because i really dislike the pumpdispenser
i would add philosophy's booster powder to make it workable
i would have preferred an actual serum
i don't think i'll continue to use this product in consideration of my eyes
i decided that it was time to start with something more focused on anti-aging
i chose this particular moisturizer because clinique is supposed to be fragance free
i decided that it was time to start with something more focused on anti-aging
i chose this particular moisturizer because clinique is supposed to be fragance free
waiting longer to apply after cleansing
i may have given it more time to adjust
kind of pricey for the results
not as i expected for the money i paid for.
i would expect a product in this price range to work better
i would say it is more of a preventative product
i see no results
not even any temporary ones like some of the other girls report
you can find a product that is cooling
the benefit of the doubt
it works when you first apply it
this product is too expensive for short-term temporary results
the amount of product that you get for the price is also a rip off
it was so expensive i am trying to persevere
they are actually at a reasonable price
i expect it to work well
the new formula made me break out
as this is the only new product i've added to my skin regimen
i just cannot deal with the side effects
great product for those on the go i.e.
needed something oil-free
my only concern is that sometimes when i apply it
for the price, i probably won't repurchase.
i assume due to introducing this new lotion
they recommended the umbrian clay which is supposed to control oil
when i apply it to my skin
i found it to be adequate
i specifically need it right now with the drying winter
i wouldn't recommend this product
i like its day moisterizer.
i now use it has a hand cream.
will not be repurchasing this personally.
currently have no acne products
if you use this product
i would rather use the stuff i buy at the grocery store
i most likely won't repurchase it
i used the whole skin care line
it is supposed to prevent
help with breakouts you do have
that helps i got the 3 step treatment
i will not re-purchase.
still on the quest for my miracle solution!
the paper another as well as the product
this was my primary acne spot treatment for over a year
this is probably one of the least effective items i have used in terms of speediness
perhaps you need to use more on a regular basis?
i seem to be having a bad experience with the efficacy of clinique products in general
s in grocery stores / pharmacies just have the similar percentage
it works pretty much the same as the grocery-store-purchased one i have
why clinique is selling this at a significantly higher price
i won't pay for the advertisement
other spending to get the same stuff
or any other spot treatment
applied it religiously per the instructions
i tried to be patient
i wouldn't recommend it for an overnight or "emergency" acne treatment
seems to have no effect on others
i am exchanging it today for a different product in hopes the new one will help more
which is what some people are saying
only applied to certain areas
i took all the necessary precautions
can't tell if its because of this product or a combination of all the new products i was using
does not provide instant results
which is no problem
will not be repurchasing!
get the same results
nothing special about this gel
also my new breakouts were still leaving dark marks while using this
with that price tag
if it were not for the inclusion of alchol denat
as the second ingredient in this product i would have given it 4 stars
i've read that hydroquinone should not good for long term use
i've decided to discontinue using this product
get new ones still
for the price i would expect this to work continuously
not to an extent that it would be considered a miracle worker
not for more sever ones
i will continue using to see if its effects increase at all
no breakout at all!
i didnt see any other effects on my skin
i couldn't tell a difference in my skin compared to cheaper drug store br
has the potential to be a game changer
my search for a good moisturizer for night use will continue
i can handle most products, but not all.
just wasnt as effective as i was hoping
this product is so mild that if you are someone who actually needs a cleanser targeted at acne
not for any other purpose
after the body bar was discontinued from proactive i was on the hunt for a good acne body bar
replace my beloved proactive bar
but not effective for me.
would rather buy a regular bar of soap that does the same job
i think this product coming from a dispenser would be a better application
the price is wayy too high for something comparable to dial
not to the instent of my expectations of the price
drug store cleansers are better then this one.
i just felt like it was no different than using any other drugstore cleanser
i won't be repurchasing this.
i apply two pumps to my clarisonic
i'd been wanting to try this cleanser
invest in a good face mask instead!
while i was told i can also use as a preventative measure
even with the pump it manages to allow you to get all of the product out
:/ for me it was a waste of money.
for people who only deal with mild acne
so the search continues
this product was recommended by 2 different sales people at sephora
it does its job
that are cheaper and just as effective.
at least sephoras return policy is amazing.
encourages me to keep using it
those aren't the products for me
i do use other acne products in conjunction with this
my experience is that natural products don't work
will continue to buy their products
t helps to remove any additional residue the wipe did not get
the cons- did not remove foundation well
that works fine since i have no makeup on
i don't think i would try the other redness solutions products either
i like this product other than the packaging
it is difficult to use the twist bottom bottle without wasting product
i wish it had a more natural scent
had high hopes for this product
the product said: oil free
i've tried soon many different moisturizers
looked at the ingredients list
as many others have said
wouldn't repurchase for the price (and scent).
i don't usually have problems with product-related breakouts
my skin will breakout
i would not repurchase.
plus it has no moisterizing effect.
since the name of this product is "redness solutions" i thought it was a no brainer
which i can tolerate
which i cannot tolerate
liked the fact that this was oil-free
• perhaps my rosacea was more server than this line could help
now i am in my type ii of rosacea
bought this for preventative measures.
i did base my purchase on its high ratings
i am not able to rate this product.
they have not refunded me for the purchase
only use below the eye level
i could not find the expiration date
it wasn't printed on the packaging or the container
in order to see effects because
i don't think the price point justifies the product
this is nothing like the other cream.
on the other h
i might repurchase after all...
even more sensible to other products after using 3-5 times
maybe it will work for other skin types
this product is meant to brighten
i will not be repurchasing this product
after the 4 or 5 applications
if you never use masks or are new to ren i'd recommend it
i'd definitely recommend hunting down a sample or buying as part of a set before you invest in the big bottle
we have to find what works for us individually.
i would not purchase this.
i cannot justify re buying it so often
love a lot of their products
after you apply this i recommend to use spf
do some research before wasting your money
9% water so you are are unlikely to reap the full benefits
you are far better off to take it orally
don't want to be wasteful
while the suggested use of this is one
why it is more beneficial to mix on your own
i don't recommend this product
i would not recommend this cream especially for the price
i gave it an honest 3 months of use to see any improvement
all it did was drain my checking account a little more buyer beware
safe to say i have giving it a fare chance to work its magic
this product was a waste of money
wouldn't purchase this item
my income comes from them making milk
i decided to return this product because i would trade dark circles overworsening fine lines
my dark circles remain the same
i suspect it might be good for lines
sephora had no stock online or in store
applaud their high quality
going back to the original anti-aging eyecream from shiseido
some reviewers are saying perhaps the good results are from the massaging motion of putting it on
if that were true
i am content to know this is who i am
will live with it for now
thought i would open the package
when you apply it
this product is a fail.
even though i follow the message steps provided
which is also stated on the jar
make sure to patch test
chose to stay with it
the produce itself is okay
now that i am acne free
if strong scents effect you than i would skip this product
as i was applying it
this is for your face
in order to have enough coverage for your face you would need a lot of product
i also believe that it’s overpriced for not achieving the desired result
as for will i be purchasing this product in the future
i wanted a higher end
i no longer use it on days i use base of any kind
i want it all for this price tag!
if i apply anything on top
that might be a better option if you want to avoid layering with this product
i've never had that problem with any other moisturizer
i could not enjoy any other perfume or other scent as long as i was using this cream
i like the consistency of the product.
i find it absolutely hysterical that the smaller size is listed as $20
i don't think it is as good as the other perricone md products i've tried
i wouldn't repurchase this
i prefer fragrance free on my face .
i no longer use this product nor would i recommend or repurchase
add this note just so people are aware of the ingredients
this extra step is not convenient
there are other products out there that work just as well
did not work well with other skin care products
do not expect any help in the wrinkle department or firmness department
go spend your money on another brand.
it was such a waste of money
received this along with a gift set of other perricone md products
'd think that a product with similar active ingredients
for the price point
it needs to deliver more results
after using this very expensive treatment for 6 weeks i am waiting for the results my pocket book expects
i give it a below average because of the cost.
you can only press down on the top to release the cream
according to perricone's website it will corrupt the product
i don't recall if there is an expiration date on this product
i hate having to find a new skin care product.
i'll have 2 return it regardless of whether it works or not
i wish it was fragrance free
i own one other perricone md product
i didn't benefit from these two products
it was recommended by many people
as for the treatment itself
clearly there is an ingredient that does not suit my skin
it has a list of ingredients
that the company says "no one else has"
the price of cable-internet connection for a month
given the exorbitant cost of some of these creams
will just stick with a cheaper under-eye moisturizer
50+ women are out of luck if they depend on this therapy
for the price, the pump should be functional.
i do feel the initial sting on application
i don't need the anti-aging protection because looking at my relatives
however they recommend weeks of use for full effect
to me this product is not at all useful.
it didn't address the puffiness that it was recommended for
definitely proceed with caution on this one.
another one of the eye products i tried
i returned it b/c i pucrchased it in conjunction with a facial moistureizer that i did not care for the packagaing
i rated it fair because i think for the price it should reduce puffiness as it claims
expiration date from date of purchase.
i called customer service
it may work for others
tried for a week after trying some of the other skin care products from the perricone md line
if i saw a difference i would have invested in paying more money on a skin cleanser
i made the mistake of purchasing this whole line
calling it citrus is a stretch
most importantly make-up at the end of the day
now this new product works fine
my $35 clinique or origins do exact the same.
the only difference was in my bank account.
jury is still out.
think this product warrants one in liew of the price
i do believe it is helping to prevent further damage/aging
prior to the use of this product my skin was perfectly clear
i will return this product.
for the price of this product
besides the eye synergy kit
that i still use
than this is the product for you
got this in one of the value packs
didn't purchase this specifically
i think that the base for this product is mostly on citrus
s the situation with this product
the ingredients list is different everywhere: there are versions i've seen printedon ole's products that differ greatly on the box
there is a list of ingredients on ole's own site that is very different from what sephora has listed
this is a major issue
there are actually many other differences in the ingredients
you have to clarify what is in your products
or are you just changing up formulas for whatever is more cost effective?
i think this is a generous amount of product for the money
just need 1 pump on average; at the most 2.
you will see such a difference.
even with a single use
i can see how others might find it offensive
they love the product for its other qualities
one reason to buy in the store
not on the internet
she used a lot, like a mega helping of it.
not effective at all though.
i also bought it because there aren't many unwanted chemicals in this br
i will try the night cream, same brand.
the natural ingredients were a real bonus with this one
the claims of lasting hydration were not true in my case
in contrast with using hope in a jar or other high-performance moisturizers which would leave my skin plumped
i would say it cause me 6 acne in total only two weeks usage
just wasn't the daily moisturizer i was seeking
i didn't notice any additional benefits of this moisture
i will not go for this specific product again
the air dispense did not work at all
i usually can find atleast one thing positive about all skin products
gross after applying it
if you are on the fence
a $45 "day" cream that claims to protect your skin should have better game
or any price for that matter.
even though they claim it to be suitable for all skin types i personally think it would be better on dry skin
i would use it everyday
so the staff suggested this as an alternative
my number one reason for only giving this 3 stars is the scent
which is the primary necessity for a moisturiser
i won't be repurchasing at this time
i won't be repurchasing
it does its job like a drugstore br
i needed something to help with oil
i will not reorder.
i would not use this as my only method of moisturizer
i am trying to find products that do not contain a list of ingredients i am allergic to
these products made me break out
well... i had many masks from many other brands.
for the amount of money
in terms of a difference in the look
i wouldn't use it in the daytime.
there aren't lasting results on that
avoid this at all costs
on to a different product line.
i love other fresh products
this face cream gives very basic results.
by all means buy this
can't speak to the long-term effectiveness of it
secondly no where the product mentions suitable skin types
i just assumed that it would be fit for all skin types
nothing special about this cream.
will not be repurchasing this product!
for the price i would prefer a better product
there is a lot of product for the price
the only reason i am still continuing to use the product is because it was expensive
or repurchase it with my own money
other than those entirely off-putting things
i might consider using it as a night cream
i understood the amount i would be getting upon ordering
like most products i've tried from fresh
like all the other products
out of my price range
i won't re purchase
it seems that no one has this issue.
which is bummer considering the high price tag
don't know what ingredient is responsible for cooling effect
i could live without it
i will not repurchase it.
the product does work
i hope others like this product.
fresh is only selling their brand.
i got this in a kit and will not repurchase.
i wouldn't purchase it for $108
essentially nothing long term
not for the price
there are better products available at other places
the price is also ridiculous for the results.
the other masks were cheaper
i've seen so many recommends
nothing special shows on my face
this was a complete waste of money
loved the actual product.
before they purchase this semi-pricey wash
def not for combo or normal
is by no means an effective time saver
it has fair cleanliness
if the acne continues i will have to switch to another br
leave a residue even if using with the clarisonic or with h
-long term effects of using this cleanser might not be beneficial to skin because ingredients are not really……
this one is such an improvement
it is always backordered online
i will use this
just not as well as the original formula
s before applying it
the same product can be bought for at least $30 less
wouldn't repurchase this particular product.
this review is simply for the cheap packaging.
its unacceptable for this price that the 'dropper' is unable to hold liquid without dripping
this product would be better served by a pump
i don't see any result from using this.
part of play kit and would not purchase.
for reference, i have normal skin.
wanted something more affordable after i ran out
mizon's is 11 dollars compared to 60-whatever that this one was
very little of the body's water content is being drawn to the site of application
at this price i expected more.
every skin will react differently to different products
the only issue is that it goes by fast!
what is the point of using it at all if you dint use it right
was in the market for a daily moisturizer with some spf protection in it since spring is here
maybe it has anti-aging properties in it
similar consistency to the clinique city block for face
i am now on the hunt for a new moisturizer
as this is most definitely not the same product i have purchased over
will be finding another product.
this may work for others
have used every one of the super defense creams with no problems
something is going on with this formulation
with the additional ingredient that they added at the end of 2008
give me the spf coverage i needed
i think i'll just stay with the $18 drugstore purchase
i still love other clinique products
had no problems with any other product
although this claims to be oil free
use many of their products
has no issues within them
i found a good replacement in first aid beauty ultra repair cream which my skin is now friends with
i do like having that option
why it is written that it is fragrance free when it is not
this just isn't like the original.
so i rate it two stars.
i wonder whether the ingredient list is incorrect because based on that it should have a nice smell
i feel i should be compensated to have endured this product
i also don't think it has the skin benefits advertised
the performance is fine
that could also be due to stress
will not be repurchasing because the smells is like a strong
even we use is as h
the pump also didn't work on mine
decent price point when compared to other options i was considering
i've liked other jurlique products in the past
i will continue using it because it was a pricey item
the verdict is still out
this one feels like i'm paying for a regular lotion that is super expensive
need to use a mattifier every single day
there was no "cooling effect" as others claim.
i wanted to try new products
i've used the murad's essential-c for a long time
i think depending on what you use over this
i tried out the whole acne line of murad products
easy it was to apply
there depending on what other products i use
will not be repurchasing.
on the other h
its hard to spread on your face it seems like it stays on the same exact spot you apply it on
foundation applies on top well
initially it does go on as matte
(i always apply a separate face spf.)
i always buy the acne sets
i won't be repurchasing.
it is not for everyday use
i don't even think this is suitable enough for normal or combination skin types
and this cleanser is no different.
i like to give all products adequate time to perform
i believe it would be best for someone with normal to combination skin
i apply it on top of the genefique every morning
will not repurchase from lancome's skin care line
this product certainly is not light-weight
which is not the case for the other products
this also goes for the night version.
no help at all for my mature face.
i do recommend all the other lancome products
i will keep using
i think this is the "renewal" effect.
the high resolution night refill-3x does not live up to its promises
i can buy a comparable moisturizer for about half the price
i happen to love the other products
can cause them to water
no matter how carefully i pump this
i love other perricone products
because with one application
for the price tag, i expected more.
though this product isn't specifically for that
wouldn't call it "high potency" or "eye lift"
this product is too pricey for the amount of lift it provides in the eye area
would not mix together well
many others of this line all the time
this is the first one that i could see immediate results
i feel like at least i'm preventing lines the best way i can
however these results are temporary at best- when i applied my liner
for the money, this product doesn't deliver.
as does the price.
only two stars for the high price
the lack of long-term performance
i still prefer perricone's original 2-part eye treatment
the jury is still out
it was a waste of product
explained that the original one may have come from a bad batch
not spending 75 bucks on such a waste
don't think it is really as effective as other products that i've used
dermadoctor says this is only temporary.
how long is temporary?i will give it a month
i may have to give this product more time in order to see results
i see no results.
my thoughts are that the product is working
to add even more insult to injury
even though i followed the instructions of applying a small amount every other day
the product may work
the return process was easy
i can semi see results
i prefer products that don't have a strong scent.
i won't be repurchasing
i will not repurchase
said it would go well with the ptr
please when buying skin products speak to sephora specialist
do not recommend this for skin above 35.
it was recommended that i try this since i have combination skin
because of that i still have acne issues
as it states on their website
sephora should have never allowed this to packaged with the clarisonic considering the brush that is included is for sensitive skin
i've used better brands from the drugstore.
pricey for the amount of use you get out of it
this can be for all skin types
not as good as other cleansers in its class
for the price i expected some sort of result.
wanted to explore her other cleansers
will not be repurchasing.
the packaging can also be challenging as you need to keep the bottle upside down to not lose the product
other than that nothing major to show for it
there isn't a lot of product to begin with
i could get the same results from a drug store br
this is my 3rd purchase from sephora.
and for such a hefty price tag i expected better!
which is a definite plus
on the other h
i decided to switch the other moisturizer for this one hoping to get more moisture
no way would i pay $65
there are other moisturizers that are also good
would suggest buying it
a sales person at sephora recommend this product to me
this product being oil-free seemed a good match
an acne breakout in the exact areas where i applied this product
i do appreciate that this is oil-free.
this product might be oil-free
not sure who would find this product useful.
it worked as good as products that cost 1/3.
i didnt' care for the thing you had to press to release the product
i know it says oil free
i switched to a different product
i am not sold on it- especially for the price
which is perpetual problem for me
i don't think i will be repurchasing this product
especially for the extravagant price--i strongly recommend you try a sample for a week before buying
i think you could find better or equal quality from a drugstore product
i'd recommend it as a spot treatment
have run the gauntlet of drug store
it's such a waste for the price
this product had a lot of promise
will need to find a new substitute for an old favourite
for the price of this
i'd rather have it all in one container than use multiple products
i will not repurchase.
after success with several other kate somerville products tried this
said she wouldn't repurchase for the price
it works for my combination skin well for the winter time
is just a average moisturizer, nothing special.
also the way the product is dispensed was really interesting at first
would i repurchase it?
will be exchanging for something else.
the entire line is of poor quality.
amount of product for that price
didn't experience any benefits w/the use of this product over the course of 1 month
the ingredient list has changed
is replaced by another less natural ingredient plus i'm not sure the goat milk ingredient is the same
i don't recommend this product.
i tried this as a sample thinking this would be a great addition to my skin care routine for summer since the sephora rep recommended it as being lightweight
i cannot believe they changed the formula
they added so many new chemicals
time to look for new brand.
ncredibly disappointed that they reformulated such a simple
just got a new bottle with new packaging
may be for another skin type
personally i prefer the other cleanser
hard to dispense the right amount
i won't repurchase this
i say go with a lower priced, basic moisturizer
i think i might have had too high of an expectation based upon other reviews that i read when buying this product
it does have a tightening quality to it
i continue to learn over
i can get the same thing from a product half the price
i found some of kate's other products like "quench"
however some of her other products
this product is such a disappointment
i think there are better products on the market.
product does go along way
fine lines or any of the above
just an average cream.
advertising say immediate results
therefore i will be rewriting this review when/if i see changes in my under eye lines
i do not see any improvement after using most of the container
i don't see any long-term improvements after using the product for +1 month
i found kate's other products "quench"
how many different cones are in this product??
there are far more advanced formulas out there that're in the same price range
we need to know more about this one before purchasing
:( so i adjusted for that.
figure it's good for the upcoming winter months.
so the penetration should not be a problem
this may work well for other skin types
which is unfortunate considering the cost
it does not address my problem
i would say that nothing compares to the effectiveness of her products
so since it is a ingredient that tops the list on the ingredient deck
i can use it last to seal in my other products
too greasy i had to return the product at my local sephora store
i would use this for basic cleaning
however i have had other good face cleansers
this s not oil free as it claims
so upset by the false advertising of oil free.
regardless of what my skin concerns were
as for the product
i most likely will be switching to another br
don't mind spending if the product is expensive
the dispenser does not work well
i hope they would consider changing the dispenser to one that can be poured out instead of squirt out in the future
i tested this product according to usage instructions
the perfume is so strong that i would not buy the full version of this for myself
there are other products on the market that do that
i would give the product a 3, the container a 1!
deliver results in my experience
you like their other products
an expensive error on my part.
have to cycle products to keep working
was rather surprised with this product being oil free
i definitely had to apply primer on top
i like the consistency of this product.
until i apply it
total waste of money unless you like that kind of smell
the description clearly says the product is free of petrochemicals
you get only one ounce for the price
not to mention that this is a lot of plastic packaging for 1 oz
use a lot of their products
i will continue to use it
the long term effects are not proven.
this is my only problem with this product
i will continue to use
i will be in the minority.
my issue is with how deceptive
the results were not anywhere near impressive enough that i would consider spending $89 for a 1 oz
it is only 1 oz not much product for the price
thought i would share
this product doesn't list it in the ingredients
the results i've gotten have not compensated for that
regular use to really see results
i do like the product overall
no change at all
she recommended this expensive trash
don't buy this product.
the search for a extraction product that actually works continues
i also didn't use this with the pore refiner which also might make a difference
save your money and buy something different.
no recommendation for this product.
it doesn't provide the immediate
using it with this product everyday
however, it is interesting to use this product!
the package in the picture is not the package you will receive
definitely would not recommend the investment
don't waste your money on this product
you have to use this religiously for this product to work
though these products are positioned for men
hoping the high concentration of peptides would give me the results other reviewers had experienced
this product for me is a waste of money
this is such an expensive product for that to have happened
its such a waste of money.
will continue to use the product
i continue to use it
i did not notice any change due to its use.
like i say it is a nutritional product which might over time make a differrence in appearance
she said that it also treats the dark circles
to the products defense though
cons: -not so sure about its "lifting/firming" capacity
that's still out for the jury
until the delivery system is improved i cannot recommend this product
this product works well
i do use other perricone products that i like
if possible i would suggest trying to obtain a sample before committing to the full size
the sales person recommended this to me
cannot speak to the effectiveness of the product
i don't think this product is made for such types
i will have to say that a sample is not enough to give a complete review
they mentioned that it has fish oil in it
which apparently is in alot of their other products
it simply isn't possible to continue using this product
the ingredients are mediocre compared to the price
given the cost of this product
i just don't like the scent in general
i probably should have used this in conjunction with other moisturizers in a rotation
with the same result
with all of it's purported benefits
i cannot believe the price
will not be added to my daily beauty regimen
this seems to be more directed towards older women
this product however worked well on fine lines.
this cream will meet expectations
not at this price
i prefer face products without any scent to them.
if i want a scent i'll apply it separately
i would've given this zero stars
perricone has other more targeted products that i would recommend
this one as a comprehensive anti-ager doesn't cut it for me
just haven't seen the kind of results as i have with layering other products
there are so many other great moisturizers out there for 30% of what this costs
go in to a sephora if possible
opened it immediately to see if all the claims for "fishy smell" were true
2 stars off for those reasons.
no benefit at all.
run..they are a scam.
this may be an effective product
i wonder if there are quality control issues with this product
shipping can cause it to spoil
night like the directions stated
the product consistency is also very similar to that
the only issue is the smell.
for the price, no way.
there are lots of other great products in this line
what this product specifically does
i hope the manufacturer
see such instant results
its really hard to apply powder foundation on top of it
i will however give it the fact that it is an excellent daytime creme due to the spf
i cannot rate this product because i never received it
sephora has yet to correct this issue.
clinique has to be using additional ingrediants that cause acne
i only apply this before bed
've been trying a few different products to help correct it
like others have said
after using this for a month i don't feel i've seen to many changes
lancome's ingredient list on box
suggest reading before buying products in future so you know what your putting on your skin prior to purchase
i expected a lot from this product seeing that it costs arm
was searching for an all-purpose eye cream to address lines
i received this product as a part of a "try me" kit
more product would warrant the exorbidant cost
that is about it
such a shame cause it works
or any product since i have no known allergies
the description says it can be used for those suffering from dryness
if you're under the age of 25
it also lasts for at least 6 weeks if not using excess amounts
to each their own though.
much like using regular bar soap would be
i would not repurchase nor would i recommend the product
the fact that they are cruelty free
the formula seems to be different.
its such a disappointment because i like using this face wash
probably a scam to buy the big one.
we also live in the midwest
this cleanser was just average
i've tried other products by this br
none of the other smell like this
i found it to be true
one of the employees recommended it
the only downside is the smell
for some reason smells like expired milk or something
that is they are growing
i am always skeptical of eye products that claim to help reduce dark circles
i suggest not putting money towards this when there are better options for the same price
the only good part about this is the cooling effect
the employee working recommended i try this product
not the other eye
as usage is the same
so that is not an issue i can address
hence, the two stars.
even though its convenient
it was a waste of money.
i wish i could give this a negative one million star
i wouldn't recommend this product
i will continue to use it
i will also try some of their other products as well
this was a waste of money.
it was a good price for trial
for the price of this, i'm on the fence.
when it comes to products like this
not just be a temporary relief
i would suggest trying the other eye product from first aid beauty
which is my problem
i love other "first aid beauty" products
not sure if i'd reorder or continue my search for the perfect product
i think it could be useful to some
my main objective in purchasing
needless to say, i discontinued it.
it's definitely useable, but i won't repurchase.
i will not be repurchasing
just as it states
i like how it applies
i will continue to use
can't quite recall which was which in terms of consistency
no other would help
i recommend researching the ingredients on a cosmetic database to see what the adverse side effects can be before purchasing
the last ingredient on the list
know that you can get like three uses out of one ampoule
could try the product without committing
the consistency puts it more in the moisturizer category for me
a beauty expert at sephora recommended i try this
i wish all skin are products came with this option
the healing effects is the only reason i'm giving it the two starts
should change the name of the product.
i think this product would be best for people who suffer from overall general redness
i truly hoped this would help my continual attempts to help address most issues
had high hopes for this
i will continue to use it
i would say this product does not cause any additional redness or irritation
and i now have lines under that eye!
i will not repurchase.
the fine lines are still the same
my pores are still the same
i will not be repurchasing.
i tried it directly on face
please repackage this product
i wish i could use this product.
it also would cause my skin
will not be repurchasing
was also a hassle to use
if you wear contacts
not using anything oil-based
alcohol is one of first ingredients.
please don't waste your money on this product
not for people with any type of acne issues
this product was recommended to me to get rid of some acne issues i was having
evaluating if other products may do the job as well without the cost
the anti-aging sell point of this product is dubious
i assumed i would be getting 3 amazing benefits in one product
t products are equal
it did nothing to reduce oil production instead i think it added shine
starting off i only gave this product 1 star rating for the fact that this is supposed to be anti wrinkle cream
i didn't have a single new breakout
then i read that this is a common thing with a lot of retinol products
this product was the exception.
as i like most of the products i have from philosophy
jar available at considerable savings for people who love this product
i think this shows a bit of respect for the consumer
in spite of the high price
i am a huge fan of trying new products that can be added to my routine
even temporary after using this consistently like i have with other products
liked other products by philosophy
an oil-based shouldn't
cannot say this cleanser will successfully get that off
it does its job
it has the same effect as baby oil.
i feel that i could achieve the same or better results for a fraction of the price using a natural oil or oil-based moisturizer
i should have read the product more clearly before buying
i told him specifically that i use a clarisonic.
i am someone who does a full face with primer
the hype around this product is false
i like when you apply
eye makeup is a different story
if it works i'll pay
it also does not foam
with no changes to the current ones
my aesthetician wanted me to use this instead of the clarifying cleanser murad makes
i decided to try this because of the anti aging properties it says it has
we are all different
you live you learn
expected more for the price
overall, i would say this is a "fair" product.
dermadoctor kakadu c seems not to have these downsides
even with consistent use
most important- they do not test on animals
they place this statement on their packaging
wanted something aggressive for lines
there is no "quick fix" with this product
you would have to use a bottle of this product to see the full potential of this product
as for the product
i decided to try this product because of survey results in good housekeeping magazine
no other change yet
i am willing to pay
wait for my refund
about the actual product
i am trying to stop aging
it was actually kind of gross.
products, and it was oil free!
this one was indeed tailored for a different skin type
it may be from this or stress
would use this to accompany it
i continued to use it
smells like any other regular lotion you could purchase at a drug store
i used baby lotion as an alternative at one point
it had the exact same affect
i would be concerned about false advertising if it hadn't
as i keep using this product
it being out of stock in store
this product is oil free
it stops working with about 10% of the product still in the bottle
the clinique one did nothing special
i would get the same result
when i apply a lot
i tried the product in both circumstances.
convenient for on-the-go
i didn't have the highest expectation
this seemed to fit the bill
you can use it over or under makeup
are willing to spend more
it's frustrating because when the expiration date approaches
i will continue to use it to see the progress
the price point is lower
i will continue using
not for any particular reason other than its easy to apply
in my opinion that is the only "effective" aspect of this product
spend your money elsewhere
this clinique item is an epic fail
an ice cube would do the same
is about all it will tolerate
this may work for people with lots of fine lines?
it's tested on animals
i must be fair
i wish i had kept the ingredient list to see what might have caused the allergy
i won't be making any repeat purchases of this product
other than that did not see any other benefit
i must say that it is made up of such strong fragrance
love the packaging but had to return.
i need to apply this minimally 2 times per day.
had high hopes for this cream
i think that so many of dior’s “hydra-life” series of products are essentially the same product just called by a slightly different name
this “pro-youth comfort crème” do essentially the same thing
wouldn’t recommend buying all of these products
which the “essential-c” has all of those ingredients
i plan to keep using it
i would not repurchase this product just because of the packaging alone
i am in my early thirties are starting to pay closer attention to "preventative maintenance"
which are my concerns
suitable for those in their early 20's
i expected that this product would be better at brightening than the alternative $20-30 eye creams available at the drug store
i will continue to apply the product hoping for results
don't think i will be repurchasing at this price though
i wish i would have known the importance of skin care then
get philosophy "eye believe" which is what was recommended when i returned this product
do not recommend for daytime use.
easy to apply, but actually no effect at all.
for the price of this product
i will not repurchase
however i simply cannot continue to use a product on my face where alcohol is in the top 4 ingredients
there are so so so many better serums on the market this one is full of alcohol which causes serious free radical damage
no improvement for sure~ :(.
however, it is nothing special.
any other cleanser could have done the same job at a lower price
like others have said
i didn't notice it working different than any other cream
since most of the times staff recommendations are spot on
i used it along with the other cold plasmas for 3 months with no difference
the thing is that all of the products have alcohol in them designed that way so you continue to buy them
gave all the criteria and needs.
i wanted it to work given how miraculous the sub d is
i found it to be just average :
even if i found this product effective
i really had high hopes for this product.
the salesperson highly recommended it saying that this was the heavy duty stuff if the other products didn't work
still shopping for an eye treatment that works...
am currently using philosophy
you can use that around your eye area
every skin is different
they were all about how good the results were.
have products that are a tenth of the price that perform the same
she thinks that i'm withholding treats!
however the smell is beyond belief.
i like the results
decided to purchase the 5 in 1 face cream for the added benefit of spf 30
i will not be purchasing anymore products by first aid beauty
will try other brand names next time.
i know the ingredients are quality
this one is a timesaver for sure.
i don't wear foundation daily
i strongly suggest trying on a small patch of skin before use to everyone who buys this
as for helping with lines
use other fab products
truly been able to accomplish it
that this has an spf 30
got this just to prevent those in the rare cases that they do happen
fully intend on returning the product
plus not cruelty free.
as a result, i won't be repurchasing.
do not apply before makeup
calling this a 'moisturizer' is misleading
giving a 1-star rating because i can't give it a zero
i will be returning this product due to the price tag
this product is close and gives me hope.
i typically do not breakout in that area
i plan to return this because although it feels luxurious
no amount of 'warming between fingers' is safe enough
i usually buy the murad kit
i also read somewhere that clay does not have any cleansing properties or abilities
i will not reorder.
do more research for another type of face wash
i plan on using that with another cleanser.
that might be a personal thing
was recommended this product by a sephora employee along with other ren products
if you order online you will not get the product as described above
this does not outweigh the fact that
i will not reorder.
i think that implies more active ingredients.
for the price i would not repurchase
it was easy to apply
accept it does not remove the dirt
i often see this being used on social media
i find for the price
don't waste your money on this product!
this product is similar to the cheaper br
as for the price i feel it is a similar product to my cheaper br
this is no match
not enough to warrant the price
i won't be repurchasing.
that is my situation
i will give this product the benefit of the doubt
since they are white i can see them
exchange this for another mask
on the other h
save your money on this one...
if you want smooth skin spend the money on a different mask
barley ever reach for it
do but buy this product & save your money.
choose something else more effective
don't waste your money on this product
one entire bottle only got me probably 10 usages because a lot of product is required to go over entire face
i would have been better off purchasing pore strips
their website claims this is for all skin types
i wouldn't repurchase solely on the smell factor.
i own almost every single one
which is disappointing compared to other products from oh
love his products in general
i wish they would make more products without it
those of you with a sensitivity to such scents should maybe avoid this one
i would only recommend this product to someone with mature
the directions say it's for am or pm use
i would choose sheer transformation
within the same price range
boasting the same benefits
discontinue items that i really like
i will stick with other products from this line
there are less toxic options available
i now use this as a eye cream
perhaps my expectations were just too high for this product because i started using a treatment that was formulated specifically for scars
(both of these are my go to brands.)
it was a complete waste of money
i'll spend my money elsewhere.
which is my only problem area
don't think i will repurchase
you will turn red within 2-3 days of usage
i used it in combination with the clinique repairwear uplifting firming cream that i had been using prior to this
i am using this more as a prevention.
it also pills when i combine it with other products
unfortunately, i don't have an indoor day job.
that did nothing to facilitate application
it might be that i am non-compliant
that it was difficult to apply
wouldn't have minded the price if the product delivered
the cream does not meet the quality i expected.
its over priced other than that the product is very greasy feeling
consider avoiding this product
in my experience with products containing 'cones
claims that no makeup can resist its effectiveness
try to be as fragrance-free as possible
will have to search elsewhere for my supply of the original dior cleansing milk
if they brought the price down to $60 i'd buy it religiously
for now i have to discontinue
i won't be purchasing.
love products that can do multiple things
there are better products that are in the same price range or cheaper
i will continue to use it
hope it isn't the cause of my dilemmas
s to help activate the product
like there may be a primer in there
while i did not factor cost into my review
i will say that i have used products that delivered far better results for the same price --
this product is nothing special
even if it was a 20 dollar product
quality usually matches the price
i won't be repurchasing.
for the price point you can get an oil that does that
two stars for the quality
sephora should be more forthcoming.
i'd save your money and look elsewhere.
it did hydrate like the name states
after using it i realized i would prefer an anti aging eye cream
cheaper options out there
might be too pricey given there are other products that achieve the same result
had high hopes for it
there are other eye creams that works better with the same price
that's the only pro of this product
no thank you on the price
i'll have to find another product to use on my eye area
for the price there are better options out there
i won't be continuing to use it given the irritating characteristics of this product
i wish it was in the form of foam !
unless you plan to use another product to "first" remove your makeup
i would not recommend the product for a thorough cleansing
the bottle itself is an issue as it means your product is exposed to light
air every time you use it
wanted to add this to the lineup
it was the only new product in my routine
the biggest reason why i no longer used this product
there are so many other products on the market that contain similar ingredients for a fraction of the price
especially at my local organic store
on the other h
i love putting this on before i apply my makeup
only downside is it breaks me out!
the scent does remind me of pinesol or pledge
you'll notice the package states
for these reasons i wouldn't recommend this product
this seems to be a problem
when will this be fixed?
it is also lacking in any sense of luxury
ultimately you can buy cheaper
i would not use this in daytime application
by all means buy this product
i would give this product five stars if it weren't for the strong smell
makes them water non-stop
i'd rather buy another product from a drug store that works instead of this
i can see it working for fine lines
a cheaper cream does the same thing.
i would not repurchase this.
won't repurchase this one
i applied the product to my face
once i went to apply my other products
it is now a must have in my skin care routine!
as for the " 11 " lines
i tried to apply foundation
i tried the suggestions on the tube itself
i believe it also states it can be used as a mask
using different products to eliminate the residue imo compromises its integrity
have to conclude that this is ineffective
also on the rare instance that i did not have the issue with the white residue
but these tips just seemed to remove the product.
there goes the product
the product stops working
or any other special occasion.
it is just very temporary
i am hoping to see improvement in this technology by ptr in the future
just wish it was re formulated to appear clear
asked for information on the store where a lady helped me to search for a product on the computer there with the specifications i wanted
even though it is recommended for women on their 20s too
this is not accurately represented
i personally think it works better as the mask if you use it nightly or daily for an hour as there are some beneficial ingredients
hope this helps as i don't mind paying for quality
that also means it has the downsides of a mask
no technique seems to provide the results i was hoping for
i will return this if sephora allows it.
also after you have used this product you can not put your bb cream
will continue to try other products.
i applied as little as possible.
in order for it to work where my fine lines are corrected
as other people have stated
after you apply it on your face or only on some areas
i've tried to apply it with some face mosturieser to dilute it
despite trying various methods
i am still on the search for a temporary firming product
while i do not generally return open items
i won't re-purchase this
don't waste your money on this product
it zero for me.
no results on my lines!
i returned the product because it was such a hassle to use
which might account for this
as one user suggested
i call a product like this a money-pit
i also wish companies would stop using soybean oil as well because it's comedogenic
this is probably due to the product having fragrance added
definitely wouldn't pay the price for this.
i think in a sephora box or value kit
it's very high up on the ingredients list
another time in the morning with no other products other than my usual cleanser
this would be perfection
i found that there were nothing very special about this product
while i believe that this may work for some people
at this price point
however i did not notice any long-term or long-lasting affects on my skin
there are many other spf options out there
anything over 2% causes issues for many
does that mean that one needs to be in the sun for several hours to get the anti-aging benefits?
i know it might be due to the spf
i know what the label says
even though i keep purchasing it
especially since i apply it to my face
which there are cheaper options out there that do the same without the flakes
no other benefits noted
think the product was compromised
which is a major deal breaker
purchase different anti aging product with the help of the sephora reps
when i heard photodynamic therapy being discussed on sirius i thought this would be a much easier way to get near ir wave exposure
it may work for some people
when you apply it
this makes it impossible to apply makeup on top of the product
i tried this at the recommendation of one of the employees
it is something i will not repurchase or recommend
this is probably the least effective product
it was a waste of money!
in what way is this "instant" ?
the low price compared to other products also gave me insentive totry something new
i see no difference after using this product
ill continue to test it out
it is considered "instant
that's what the product description states
i am still searching...
the "instant" in the name is a bit misleading.
i'd call working within 15-30 minutes instant
on the other h
it does its job for the day
the fragrance is so strong that i won't be using this
would not consider purchase this
you can definitely find better choices in the same price range
not a fan of the new formula.
after you apply it
trying a new brand now.
not sure if this reformulated one is the same
i hate the new formula !
what was the point of this new formula?
just release an separate product.
oil free for some time now
still the same product
come to find out the oil free has been reformulated
i went searching for a comparable
i think because of the price i had high expectations
because of the consistency of the product
i will not be re-purchasing.
for the price of this item
think the price is actually comparable to other high-end eye creams i've purchased
having one product to address both issues is a real plus
think this is not acceptable
(or amend this one.)
i hope this helps!
sephora associate also recommended using it around the lips to address fine lines
i don't mind a high price tag for an effective eye product
thought i would switch up to this higher end product
the pump alone has caused me issues.
sephora was great with offering to return the bottle for a new one or giving me a refund
i decided to return it for a refund
there are many other products which cost much less yet offer the same results
i do not recommend at at price tag of $100
which should be an option when you're spending $100 for a product
this is one of them
basically a recipe for disaster
also doesn't hold very well under makeup.
which by the way
i would not purchase this product again due to the packaging
i give it a three star for high price
heck there should at least be some improvment
don't see any justification for the price plus the weeks wasted when i could have been using a product that delivered on its promises
i am a true caudale' user
it's at what we call the 50% line which means it's listed at the middle of the ingredient list
working down towards the end being the least
i am giving this product only two stars in the hopes that laura mercier decides to pay attention to the feeback provided by her customers
fix the packaging on this item
there are other oil-based face washes out on the market that i will be giving a try
i work in consumer products
i recommend transferring it to a screw top travel bottle
does not mix well with other products
with skin care products it is trial
love the price which is why i'm giving it 3 starts
makeup companies that test on animals
all i can think about are the animals eyes that the products are tested on
is sometimes good for a 3-star review on that basis alone
it did not decrease any of the fine lines that are starting to appear
tried this with consistent use.
he also raved about its anti-aging/wrinkle fighting properties which i have yet to see
packaging is also ridiculous for such a small amount
so my expectations were on the higher side
i did not notice any visible results or other advantages over other products that are far less expensive
therefore was a waste of my money
for this amount of money
i love their future response cream
i don't have aging concerns
spending well over $100 on this is ridiculous
unnecessary in my opinion
i suggest you save your money
i found that it to have a masking effect once you apply it
i can live with that.
confused to see that "alcohol" is the 3rd ingredient in this product
which alcohol being 3rd in the ingredient list means that there is a very high percentage of it in the product
with its description suggesting it takes on all signs of aging
targeted toward a luxury market
think it was a waste of money
i cannot comment on the long term effects of the product
the creme was not mentioned among those.
the smell of this product i would recommend it
just like any other clinique products
they don't live up to their reputation
that our bodies stop producing some type of chemical or oil or something as we get older
there are cheaper options out there.
the reason i gave this 3 stars is because of the price
basing my decision on the cost of the product
why companies put such strong fragrances in face products
i don’t use this twice a day as the label recommends
could i be convinced into buying it for the off label benefits?
this is the latest in my endeavors to find something to reduce my pores or at least make them look smaller
knowing that this kind of product can take a few weeks of use to reveal its full benefits
which this product specifically sells as its purpose
found that with my current cleanser
i've seen countless ads for this product
it has no long-term effect
will not be repurchasing.
i even tried an experiment
hoped that this product
for such a pricey product i expected results
let alone any difference in the visibility of my pores when just applying the product as you would with the benefit pore product
i wouldn't recommend or repurchase this.
i wanted a long term solution
this product does not maintain your skin oil-free
another waste of my money.
everything i use is oil-free
for such a expensive product i expected to notice something other than any other moisturizer
that is how long it took for some users to see results
it would be really helpful for products to specifiy the amount that should be used for each application
needs to lower their prices because they use ingredients with little quality
the sales associate convinced me that this cream would do the trick
the salespeople had been trying to talk me into perricone for a long time
since i love the other perricone products
i don't mind spending money on products that produce results
i love some other perricone products
am considering not repurchasing because the dropper is so difficult to use
they had difficulty with it also
please change this packaging!!!
i do not know why sephora insists on shifting customers to one specific br
when i ask them which of the products they carry would be good for a specific purpose
was advised to try it a bit longer
i gave it one star only because the review is not exceted without the rating
i almost couldn't use the entire bottle because the last 20% of the bottle can't be accessed with the dropper
still not a fan of the 'cones so high up on the ingredient list
although i do not have a money tree in the backyard to pay for my expensive beauty regimens i continue to buy
we need to preserve/protect it despite the expense
they advertise better skin firmness in ten days.
used the product religiously every single day with no results that i could see
for the price i expected even a moderate return for the investment
at this price point i want something that gives greater results
recommend you do your research before you spend the $100
no spf which is a downside.
though not as expensive as la mer it still has a high price tag
my other complaint is the packaging
you are going to want to choose between a product that really is anti-aging
can't comment on the effectiveness
i received this product this time as a present
still waiting for a credit for this $90 product
for some reason the jar is never filled correctly
there is a hole in the product.
otherwise i like the product.
facials once per month to control these problems
the information on the website did not have any warnings for people with oily/combination skin like mine
it should be safe for them
i will be more careful trying out sample products in the future
the search goes on :(
i didn't find it to have any anti-aging benefits
i made the mistake of buying this instead of the one without spf
love the original....but not this one with spf.
would not switch to this product
just ordered some more of the algenist firming
not for someone who needs help with firmness
will be exchanging this for a different algenist product
this one was recommended to me by a sephora rep i trust explicitly
at this price point
i imagine with continued use
the other one is spf 50
t must be the addition of the spf
i'd recommend more work on this product.
still love other algenist products
works great alone or over other serums
more effective products out there
this is an average eye cream which doesn't live up to all it says it will do
i will not be repurchasing it
i did like that this product is fragrance-free.
this product makes many promises
is the reason why i decided to purchase
this balm is fine while you are using it
as per the instructions
after using this product i now have 2 prominent lines
i will not repurchase.
despite its price tag
product did not minimize the appearance of fine lines
i saw some reviews said its can see the anti aging after 10 days
3 were both no different
which is the right formula?
all main ingredients from the tns are al
i will be continuing my search for something that treats my dark circles
i won't be repurchasing.
i applied the product to my eyes
once i went to apply my other products
so this product works
i only wear foundation on special occasions
before you buy this product
make your own call
one day i was looking at all of ptr's products
i cannot live without this product
i applied the product on my undereyes
the product needs to be on the skin
if i over-apply this
the formulation does not tolerate make up application post use
although fine lines are indicated in the product description
you lose the effect
if you wear foundation you cannot apply it over areas that has the product on it
this product was recommended by one of the store managers
this was a waste of money and time.
if they can figure how to re-formulate
quick refund to my card
not worth the price if you have to reapply so often
i did see a reduction in the bags
it does not work with any other products
i find this product does firm
no matter how light i tried to apply it
although that could be user error-- i don't use a setting powder or any kind of setting spray
i lofe the brand buy this just wasn't up to par.
the amount of product you get
it has just not delivered on its promise
if they all are similar to this one
night with fab results above
3 stars for how expensive it is vs
coconut oil works better, so i won't repurchase.
my final verdict is that for the price there are far better cleaners available
love so many josie maran products daily
will probably dispose of it
i wouldn't purchase it for a couple of reasons
the price tag on this particular cleansing oil is appealing
so am guessing this is the culprit to both of my concerns with the oil
unfortunately i will not be purchasing this product
as with most other josie maran products that i've tried
it falls short of expectations especially at this price point
tried adding a lot of water as per the instructions
i enjoy all of the other josie maran products i've tried
i don't recommend this product.
i also did not use this under foundation.
i used this solely as a moisturizer.
the reasons why i would give this product some stars are:1
it seriously tastes gross
i will not repurchase
i applaud the product coming in a glass bottle with a pump
i don't feel an overall need to encourage others to buy it
it would be more suitable for a night cream as it didn't fully absorb into my skin
you have to use a lot to cover your entire face
every skin is different
secret hope it will redeem itself
this is for you
i also started a couple of other new things
there are more budget friendly options available
for the price i would like to buy something with more benefits to my skin
that my skin can benefit from more
no anti aging benefits or added miracles that should be in most moisturizers
i would opt for something with better ingredients
you'll get all the positive benefits from this moisturizer
others may like it
i rather a company invest in other ingredients besides the smell
the only thing i like is that its lightweight compared to others
this face cream is nothing special in my opinion.
i wanted a basic cream for my face
i would/will purchases this eye cream in the future
used an extra amount of this in that one specific area
back to researching and trying other products.
there are other eye creams that combine better treatment
either this was a 'bad bunch' or they changed the product
ended up retuning it because it felt like it should yield some results for its price tag
which i would have preferred
i usually love benefit products
i would not repurchase
can advise if its good for that
used the whole pot, with no results to speak of.
i chose it over a less expensive option because of all the natural ingredients
considering the high price
will not be repurchasing this cream
this may help you
i don't see the situation improving
just not what it was advertised for on this site
i think i will be searching for a new anti-aging solution
we do need to be aware that not all products produce the same results for all people
this may be formulated to work on a different kind of skin
or in conjunction with other murad products
could be another sign of my allergy
i've tried so many products to try
but the product is absolute garbage.
i would recommend this for younger skin types didn't see much of a pay off with anti-aging benefits
it's a waste for the amount this costs
honestly the results are just average
kind of a waste of the product considering the price
mine are related to genetics
i agree with other reviewers that it is hard to apply make up over it
still on the search!
i would put them in an account for plastic surgery
i would not use this if it were at a lower price point
got to give it credit for helping my h
over with no results
this product was only adequate
or even some high-quality all-over moisturizers for that matter
got this on an in store recomendation
not an average eye cream at the drugstore that gives me the same result?
being swayed by the description of products
would probably be good as a preventative instead of corrective
i don't see this eye cream working for that purpose at all
which makes makeup difficult to apply over it
nothing special about the product
their line usually works for me
have had great success using many of their products
i did not read the ingredient list -- it has retinyl palmitate
as they are a result of genetics
i figured any other effects would be icing on the cake
in summation: i don't think the product lives up to its description
e well on my face
i will buy this again when ren increases the amount of product inside the tube
i might just go the diy route next time
definitely will not repurchase at this price.
not suitable to remove makeup.
the price is similar to other ren exfoliators
i know what an ounce is
there is not five ounces in this tube
i would estimate that there is about half that amount in the tube
not for half that amount
above says it all the results were very poor had to return
i wouldn't recommend this product.
some products i can react to
i tend to go for some of the more natural products which is why i sprung for this one
i'll be using the aha concentrate on its own for now on
it might work for others
recommendation...try it for yourself.
all other key ingredients that you would want to take care of the under eye area
i will just use it up for other areas.
this one is a definite skip.
i also agree if this product is used anywhere near the eye area
the deal breaker for me is the mess it makes of whatever eye products i apply over top
i will not be buying this product
the person i gave it to uses it without issue
one even states that it produced those hard
i can only address the formulation of this moisturizer as i returned it after two weeks
it suits the purpose
which is a deal breaker for me
this product does everything the description states however if i use it
help reduce the lines that are a result of the dehdryation
i am still trying various products throughout the line
this at least is reasonably priced
are fragrance free [i have found some murad products to have a rather unpleasant scent]
for $65 i would use that money elsewhere.
had to discontinue and return this item.
in fact i think it might be responsible for me getting acne on my chest
it was recommend by a beauty consultant on site at sephora for a day so only time will tell
i could only give it a 3 rating for now.
i feel like the perricone products are overall overpriced
we both asked each other
my search for an amazing eye cream will continue though
i only use certain products by perricone.
have tried many in my quest
it comes in the correct packaging
i'll be looking to other products.
if dark circles is an issue for you
i still see the same lines
the jury is still out
i don't see any difference between this eye cream or any other cheap br
and it should at its price.
also on the topic of price
out of all the perricone face products this is the only one i can use
do believe its over priced for the amount you're getting however will continue to use as works well
this product comes no where close in my opinion.
they are both average.
i think i had higher hopes for this to work.
the new formula doesn't work for me
this product must be discontinued.
of the same type of product
it costs about 1/3 the price of this one
have had a similar non- experience with one of the ptr eye creams
it works as well as other high-priced br
yet it contains 1 oz of product
this company knows they are fleecing the customer
did not apply excessive amounts
the sales associate highly recommended this product because i use other ptr products which work well with my skin
i tried putting it on after other products as well
for a product that costs more than the other dark spot correctors
expensive for non brand product.
the product leaves your skin softer than any other product i've ever used
for the cost it's not exactly an economical purchase
i don't know whether this will be great using with its original mitten
at first i wanted to give a try to this expensive cleanser
5 oz because there are half people said this is a good product
i can see someone paying that price for a luxury br
there has to be way cheaper options out there.
needed additional method to remove make up from my face
i can see how this might be well-suited to one-step cleansing
which i'm sure negated any benefits
felt less than basic in the cleansing category
went online to find the proper way to use it
am familiar with how to use these
or like the description says
i will not be repurchasing this.
if you are only using your h
s to apply to your face
this product works fine
this is the only product in my algenist collection that i am just 'meh' about
i wouldn't buy it separately
i will continue to use other algenist products
as of right now i wouldn't repurchase
stress related i've gone through many products to clear it up
the rep at sephora said it would help with the acne
i believe that was the problem with the algenist.
i plan on using theirs
continued to with the use of this product
i've committed to the entire bottle
used it alone to test that theory
i can apply a generous amount
i prefer the pumps
i don't think i'll keep using this brand.
i am new to using the algenist line
right after applying the product i was not satisfied with the hydration
i don't see a reduction in fine lines
i do not feel like a long term major difference for the price i paid
it did not absorb quickly as some of the other ladies have stated
for the price point
there are other masks that do as good as a job
it definitely did not meet up to the quality or results of the other amore pacific products that i have used
so buyer beware: this stuff contains a lot of alcohol
i hoped this would be the intensive care my skin needed
it does disappear into the skin as other reviewers have said
not a "must have" in my anti-aging arsenal.
ethanol so high up on the ingredient list.
anything with "moisture bound" in the title should not contain alcohol
i think i can definitely a cheaper substitution for $20 for another sleeping mask
clinique has never failed to be non irritating
i wouldn't the results matched the product description
this product works fine
had high hopes for this one
i'd been hearing such good things about their new products that i decided to trust the reviews
"combination oily" skin was probably not going to be true to at least one of those categories
i cycle through different br
try new ones often
picked this one up, and dislike it strongly.
will not be repurchasing this product
i would purchase a similar
i will just use the oil base.
when used all over the face the scent can be strong
this product was a bit of a let down because i had high hopes based on the micellar water hype
i will not repurchase
they said it is the one they use in the store
i think it contains alcohol.
not sure, need to look on label.
i currently fighting have an awful breakout all over my face
does not remove make up thoroughly as advertised
this would be a product i consider
i will continue using since i do like the fact that it has a hint of brightener
i can alternate it with my everyday eye cream
i received it free from influencer in return for my honest opinion
so i had high hopes for this product.
the actual price seems fair for the product.
watched the instructional video because i have definitely been applying too much product
haven't considered myself the anti-aging cream category
unless it goes on sale or is part of a kit
i doubt i will repurchase
the other products in this skin care line all have a great smell to them
i received a complementary product from influenster in exchange for an honest review
i received this eye cream for free to try.
while i loved the other products in the ginzing line
i usually enjoy the origins products
i will recommend this product.
will probably only use it as such
give it a fair shot
there are at least a dozen other cleansers out there that offer effective makeup removal
i can see that origins has products that are specifically meant for dry
looks like i'll have to do my own research from now on
will not be repurchasing
the way i test products is one at a time
i seem to be having an acne breakout like i used to have in high school
save your $17 and use it on a better product.
however i found that other options from the drugstore worked better for me
however i get the same results with toothpaste
i got this in a kit with other items
there are probably similar products that can be purchased at sephora or elsewhere that work better
will not be repurchasing in the future
i find this improves any break outs i have
overall i would probably repurchase
therefore i thought this would be the perfect product
it could have also been from other products as well
overall coming from a somewhat pimpley teen with combination skin if you have the same skin as me i would recommend trying this product
haven't found it to help at all
i am currently having a pms breakout
i am just having a hard time justifying spending $20 on such a small bottle
i desperately wanted to believe in this product
the main type of acne i suffer from is r
at least with any urgency
did not eliminate acne spots as advertised
i tried this since i like many of the other origins products
do believe the overall value as far as product volume is good
wish they came in larger sizes for people who want to incorporate it into their skin care routine
you will need couple of applications to see the results
i tried not to have high expectations
you changed the formula.
i may try the oil free version of this
i tried different application amounts
it does also have a smell that
had high hopes for this product
it makes me doubt if the products layered on it will lose their efficacy when used after it
i don't notice any of those affects from using the origins
i love other products
there are better value products
this was the only new product in my skin care regime
i prefer my first-aid cream.
it is nothing special
everything that's good on the ingredient list just degrades the second you opened the product
the amount i applied was adequate
wouldn't recommend this product
i will be returning this product for a refund immediately
the breakouts are now diminishing which leads me to believe it was from this
perhaps i should have tried the oil-free version of this
will not re purchase.
dry—despite my environmental aspects beign the same
i will not repurchase.
i'd consider my skin type to be combination-type.
although this product seemed average to me
i did not see any difference in regards to its anti-aging claims
i tried to use, but will discontinue.
sephora was good about accepting it
my skin has been breaking out non-stop
i can't give this a fair rating because my skin has been problematic for a couple of months now
i don't think i will be repurchasing
still enjoy using this
i don't seem to be drawn to using any mask in particular
will keep hunting for a mask i love
i tested it out and the results were not bad!
when you first apply it
don't cause me to be aggressive in order to remove them
which is what i primarily wanted out of this product
i've tried a multitude of different treatments to get rid of oil on my t-zone
i would have better off using a bar of soap
is a better deal than certain other popular charcoal masks
i went to my local sephora store to shop for affordable skin care products
one of the people that work there recommended me this mask
you can't find a better one at the drugstore for half the cost
not enough to warrant keeping this cream
my only concern is fine lines
not worth the trouble of using a cloth with it when there is other option for removing makeup
i would recommend it for a am/pm eye cream.
hated it, such a waste of money.
doesn't deliver on all its promises either
too expensive to repurchase- there are other more affordable eye creams that are just as hydrating at a fraction of the cost
on the other h
which is why i’m giving it three stars
i won't repurchase because of the price i believe i could find something better or at least the same for a cheaper price
wanting something with a few more anti-aging benefits
i will not be repurchasing.
i wanted to minimize the damage being done to my skin
since there are other origins products i love
so when sephora stopped shipping my regular face wash to canada
i figured that my skin needs to adjust to it because it's new
not super dupe special
thought i could help combat this with zero oil
can stop regretting this purchase
i feel like i would get the same results from a drug store product
it paraben free though so perhaps i will try a different cleanser from them in the future
i will not be repurchasing this particular one
i must say, this product rocks.
so on those counts
does not do a good job o cleaning or helping reduce oil production
i would recommend a name change or this product
it also did not "quench" my skin's thirst
won't be repurchasing it
it causes me allergies every single time.
had a positive track record for quality
i am still on the lookout
please please please try fresh rose mask
the only one i will use in the future
when you apply it
except for this one
after each application my skin feels
if you are willing to pay $10
i bet you can buy some better moisturizers
after every single use
i also thought it would be more considering the price
i won't be reordering
i just signed it to purchase it based on does sephora socia
instead of daily switch to every other day
i do want to point out that it claims to be oil-free
there are several different kinds of oils in its formula
i love many other origins products
their other products i love
decided to try it after seeing the long "formulated without" list
while they both live up to their claims
i prefer a jar so that i know i'll be able to use 100% of the product i paid for
i decided to give this a try due to the oil free aspect
i must amend it
or any improvements at all
invest in other orgains masks such as original skin or the charcoal one
i am in my 20s with regular breakouts from period
leave it in longer or use it as spot treatment
i believe i could find other alternative effective
i also love origins products usually
i'll be finishing the pod but won't repurchase.
i won't be repurchase the out of trouble mask
did not work for me on a hydration level either because while my skin was producing extra oil
furthermore i have combination skin
did not notice any "clarifying" properties while using it
other products accomplish this
when i would apply this gel
i decided to research the product further
do not actually have as many skin benefitting qualities that one would think based off of the product claims
i can't bring myself to pay for such a small amount
the amount that you pay
come on boscia give us more product for your really high prices
i am reluctant to repurchase
i would have given this product 5 stars if the packaging had been a more practical one
transfer the actual product to another
the packaging is also a problem
i feel i need more benefits from a moisturizer than this has to offer
more packaging than product.
even with daily use
cannot speak to the packaging of the regular size product
which i love her oil free one
i chose this as a replacement since that one is too expensive
my eye area did not feel moistured a total waste of money for this product
will not be repurchasing.
as i'm only 25 i want to prevent this as long as possible
i guess its supposed to be more preventative
i did not find this product useful.
use all of their products
sagginess in the description i have now
ii see no improvement in the bags i am beginning tp get
it goes in the trash with all the other products that don't live up to the hype
the ingredients are not at all what the product claims to be
i see no benefit at all
after i apply it on my face
now i use it as a primer because i think if i use it as a concentrate
the wording on the packaging is different too
you can not gauge the amount in the bottle.
which i'd hoped the turnaround concentrate would take care of on its own
so a sephora recommended this product to me
decided to try this for the added moisture
beware of using this product
however the new packaging is disappointing
feel it is too soon to give a fair review about its effectiveness
the dropper gives an inconsistent amount of product each application
i will continue to use the product to see what the results are like
i will not be repurchasing
undecided - i've used this daily for 4 months.
at least sephora has good customer service.
i am still open to trying other products in this line
appreciated the no hassle return
that you only need one pump for your entire face
per my sephora sales person
others on the market to choose from that are less expensive
could not see any beneficial effects plus the hydrating result was just not there
i may purchase this in the future as i really liked the quick absorption
i wish i could give this more stars for the superior type of hyaluronic it contains
that is not the one that holds more hydration
it is half the cost
i expected this one to be superior
love trying out new products
won't be purchasing any more perricone products.
after to try to see if there was any objective evidence of improvement
i may have had same result with sugar water
still am wiling to pay more money for good anti-aging products
at this price point
before i buy any anti-aging products
the filtering options won't allow us to choose reviews only from specific age groups
am usually only interested in reading reviews from those in my age group because i'm very serious about my anti-aging regimen
the money i invest into it
if you're in the 50+ age range
this product also does not cause irritation
anything i invest in better deliver significant results
not needing a surgical lift for as long as possible
private reserve for around my eyes
there is also a br
i can achieve the same effect
the rep at sephora said it takes weeks for the cell turnover to happen
i don't see an improvement
all the enthusiasm from the sales people made me stick it out
since it is so expensive i'll use up the bottle
i gave it one star because for the price it should deliver
had high hopes for this one
i looked at the ingredient list
there was no additional hydration
i will continue using it in the hope that it will stave off future wrinkles
that the only way i felt this product was effective
i continue using it
not even compensating with moisturizer was able to prevent the break outs
one of the associates told me that i shouldn't be using this everyday
boscia needs to change their packaging.
i got a free mini of this product through a sephora mobile offer
the only reason i'm giving it two stars
after a fair go of it
which you can get for under 20 dollars
when other alternatives can be used
i cannot say whether or not it is effective at firming because i had to discontinue use after the breakouts
i do like it for under eye use
while i did enjoy using it
this product does zero.
either they are lying or work for the company in one way or another
which you can obtain for a fraction of the cost somewhere else
i try all the products at sephora
it did not lift or firm
drug store brands do better than this loser.
for the amount that i use
the results were poor for the price
for the price point
i've only just started using this cream in my quest for a new moisturizer with an anti-aging kick
it should have an spf included
i can't believe this line offers a separate spf product
even though algenist claims their product is non-comedogenic
no corrective features what-so-ever
based on the line
i won't be repurchasing this item.
even if this product had a drugstore price
i will try other algenist products.
i used the entire bottle as instructed on the label
i did a lot of research before deciding to buy this product
could use it under makeup
i will use the whole bottle
i don't have high hopes
:( i will not repurchase.
algenist should put this as a 10-day treatment b/c it makes it worse after
there are better products in the drug store
it is a longer term commitment if you want the results claimed by the product
i don't think this product does anything more than any other eye moisturizer in terms of minimizing fine lines
i would like to see some kind of sign however small that it is working
s this compares to some of the cheaper br
love some of the new algenist products
this is greasy even though it is marketed as the opposite
try out different products in order to find the perfect product
i definitely prefer the wild rose line
i wanted the balancing act
whatever effect this product initially has on my skin
i added an additional star
i would not recommend this product as it is only a waste of money
while i had an issue with the primer
i will go on with my impossible mission.
i wouldn't re-purchase
i'll stick to oils in the future
am not tempted to repurchase
overall giving the cost
purchased this based on reviews that as a hybrid gel-cream it worked well for other people with combination skin
the reason i got this product is becuase i need the light-weight formula
i did not like the product i had higher expectations considering it's price
i recommend this night treatment for anyone who has aging concerns
oil on top or even alone
as is always the case a good/effective sample mean an expensive full size product
after using all of the product religiously everyday
i can see this causing problems for me in the future because of the scent
decent even with the price range its in
this was a complete waste of money
i've used other products from the wild rose collection
considering i've had other products that work just as great
this being one of them
would be a 5 star if still in the original packaging
i will be searching for a new cleanser.
there has to be another solution?
as stated by many of the long
faith customers of this company/product
that companies update their packaging
i always loved that ren was a low waste company as they built their moisturizer pumps to use every ounce of the product
like others have stated
i'd rather risk trying a new company at this point
it is a good amount given for the price i will say that
for the value i prefer clinique take the day off balm
had such high hopes
that was a new for me
didn't want to risk more adverse effects
i question having to spend almost $50 on a cleanser
please bring back the original formulation!
i see no difference after using it religiously
application is very different from others
it was only a temporary fix:
i still use it for wrinkle prevention
my skin looks the same
i am 40 and have combination skin.
money on this one
look- it gave it a freshness i've not experienced with any other product
i will not reorder until a change is made in the dispenser
i've not see any reduction in lines or immediate results on anything
the aerosole stops working about 1/2 they way through your product
with such specific instructions on how to use it
which i will continue to buy
for this price point
my skin looks the same
my makeup was difficult to apply
i wouldn't make this investment
had very high expectations for this serum based on my use of previous ptr prodcuts
what sold me on this product was when the sales person told me it would help with the deeper lines around my mouth
perhaps this could be tolerated at night
the price itself is reason for pause.
no dimishing of lines at all.
i would consider this on the treatment spectrum
i always buy fragrance free
i know from experience that there are ways to filter
perricone needs to consider taking advantage of some of these processes to aid in the bad smell of some of his signature products
now i have to use medicine
000 in my lifetime on products to address this
i will continue to use it
she should seek other employment
it needs to be taken off the market!!!
i bet there are other products that give better results
i may store it
my boyfriend is currently using the blue label
i did apply it to my face
for the price i expected results
those were the benefits of the product.
it can be good,but for certain skin types.
red after i apply it
so they lose their function
when i saw that they were offering a package deal with this truth creme included
i will continue to use it as an under eye moisturizer though
be aware- smell this before you buy it.
or look at it.
i strongly suggest sampling this in-store to see if you can st
although i did read later in the description that it is a combination of citrus
perhaps they needed to test this product first before taking it to mass production
i don't have any complaints other than the smell.
i find that if i apply it to my neck
have yet to find the perfect product to control that
please fresh give more of the products!!
this is supposed to help control oil
it did make a difference in the amount of oil on my skin
am going to continue to try other products
the tucson air is simply not helpful for keeping my poor skin under control
i did recently purchase the anthony logistics for men instant fix oil control
even though it is a men's product
that product, i would recommend!
does nothing to mattify beyond the initial application
decided to check the ingredients
no doubt alcohol was the third ingredient in this product
for the price tag
don't recommend to buy this product.
future applications were not as effective.
i do enjoy this product.
i've had this on my list of things to try for a while
i assume this is from from menthol.
i would save your receipt if you buy this product
has a separate cap which is not really useful as the stick dried within a month
i willingly shell out more money than i'd care to admit for quality products
this is an obscene amount of money for the size of the product
wish there was a different application method or packaging for easier use/dispensing
i wanted to try a new eye product
i look forward to trying a different product.
the problem is the price
it cost $35 in store
or at least a reasonable amount for the priceprice
this is running out already while the other products are almost full
wish there was more product for the price
i wish sephora would start selling the skyn eye cream
i like this company
will still be on the search for a more effective produt
in fact buy this
i think most of the product transfers to my pillow
based on my experience
i can't speak to its long term benefits
don't know why the company would choose to add such a heavy fragrance to this product
will not be repurchasing
their return policy is hard to follow if not impossible due to super narrow return period
i splurged on this product during the vib sale along with some other items in this line
which is what you expect for the price
there are less expensive alternatives out there that will do the same
this is one that i will not be re-purchasing due to the very high price
i agree; this mask is nothing special.
it delivers results similar to that of glamglow
i will not repurchase this mask
the package tells you to apply the product generously
i don't know if that was an oversight on the part of the company
when i apply it
does not deliver much in skin improvement results for the price
i will not reorder this.
i think this product is popular for its scent more than anything
won't be re-purchasing
makeup dollar on things that perform
the pricing of the line is kind of insulting for what you get
i can see this happening with a cheaper drug store br
or just buy a different one
i wish there were a way to resolve this problem because it's making me hesitant to purchase other products from clinique that require a pump
you have to use it religiously
thinking that the spf would outweigh a product without it
i wanted to warn others
it caught my eye when shopping online because i typically order things that contain natural ingredients
i gave this review two stars because of how great the ingredients in this product are
i can only assume that that comes from the natural ingredients
trying a new skin care product can do that
i don't find it groundbreaking like other sr products are
i will not repurchase
4 stars on this product
on that basis alone
a fairly pointless purchase considering the available
even though it costs $125
including one product that sephora doesn't sell that cost more than $200
at these prices i can't afford to use it all the time on a retired person's salary
rather than the 2 pumps recommended
while everyone on the internet is hyping this product up
i do not recommend the product for combination skin
i believe for $158 you should be able to provide a good smelling product
it was a waste of money
i would not purchase this
every time i use i have breakouts all over my skin
i usually buy things blindly
try cheaper alternatives until you absolutely need this
forth about whether i wanted to spend so much money on a single skincare product for about 6 months before i actually bought this
felt exactly the same after using this product in conjunction with the ufo oil
for the price i would expect to see some benefit after the amount of time i used it
i would not purchase it because for the price
before purchasing i'd recommend getting a sample if possible to see if it works for you
i won't repurchase unfortunately.
this was a waste of money
and for that price tag, no thank you.
given the amount needed
i don't foresee this bottle lasting a long time
5 oz one to give it a try
i would not have purchased this product on its own
i did not research on this at all prior to my use
there are none of any benefit in the ingredients listing
this product is a total waste of money ladies!
this is my first real anti-aging product
i plan to keep using it
i found that this product
it seems to go on well (ie.
it was such a hassle to apply
have tried other oil base products
i know some people say your skin can take some time adjusting to a new product
i am hoping this will provide more impact over time with use
not so much for combination/seasonal greaseballs like me
find it funny the biggest proponents at the store are those in the 20-30 year old range for whom it's not necessary
decide what the results are from there
00 minimum purchase i was going to buy my usual philosophy help me with retinol in it
what my face is use to
i will not be repurchasing this product.
i spend a lot of $$$ at sephora because they are excellent about allowing returns on products we do not like
just save your receipt!
was hoping i could use something like this before reverting to injectables
i will likely not repurchase since its a steep price tag for just a primer
asked a sephora beauty expert what to get because my foundation tends to settle
each time i get the same results.
this was a total waste of money
that i would give it more of a 3 with other products out there
i count it a loss of money
i don't think it offer long term or permanent result for wrinkles
it works best to use apply apply bb cream than do a lite press powder or foundation
save your money on this one.
i can find better products for a cheaper price
for the price i expected more.
i used this religiously for over 6 months in hopes it would clear up my adult acne
for the amount of money
bought this because i couldn't find the on a clear day product which i believe may be discontinued
guess i should have paid attention to the fluid ounce size advertised
the packaging is ridiculous
as others have stated
at one point in my life accutane was the only remedy
it is difficult to squeeze the right amount out of the container
i won't be repurchasing.
i chose this product after doing much research.
given that i have had much luck with some of the "best" product recommendations from her site
though it would help with the acne
the product seems to be working
work as well w/ same main ingredients
returning to other product that works as well for less
your paying for a name on this one.
it would be less wasteful
i wish i had a choice between the two items
i would have both in my regiment instead of being combined all the time
breakouts i would suggest you steer clear of this product
treatment from the same line
have obsessed over all of their products
we will return to her previous brand.
this spot treatment is not that spot treatment.
not that great... ptr is more effective
i used it all won't repurchase
for the price it is fair quality
the regular moisturizer are the same both don't work
this was given to be as a solution to that.
i found out through this product that my face already produces a lot of oil so using this product i had a ton of oil on my face
will not be repurchasing.
there were no eye slots
if you love eye treatments my recommendation is to pass on this one
they are not as purple looking as they were before i used it
i will say that for the price
frequently change my routine to keep products working for me
i used 80% of the product to ensure it wasn't just the product "doing its magic"
there are way better purchases that can be made for half the price
the new formula has too many fillers
this was the only product to keep it under control
collectively they all did a good job of getting my acne under control
i this doesn't live up to its price
the new formula is not working nearly as well
i didn't find this product did anything special compared to other oil frees at less cost
even though the product is labeled as oil free
i think it could just be a compatibility issue with the ingredients
was sold on the oil-free component
ed to breakouts that i am already dealing with
this product was nothing special
it is making mebreak out
only because of the pump
expected more from the price point
i tried this product instead because my usual moisturizer i buy was out of stock
while i will say this lotion does close them up more than any other pore minimizing product i've used
which is not preferable for a lot of people
i attempted to mainly use this product on the area of my face that benefit from more matte coverage
for the price its not buying me the extra time that it should to justify it
i like the 3-step
still the same problem
these products are not what they are represented to be
ren has great products as an alternative
this was extreamily disappointing because this was an expensive item for a student to purchase
you think you are receiving for the high price
he should seriously consider dropping the price to a more affordable $80
so points for knowing the approx amount a person will use
with so many other products out there
i know skin care is trial
error which makes sephoras return policy all the better
i will not repurchase.
either immediately upon application or in the long term
for the price i'd like to notice some sort of difference
i definitely won't be repurchasing
don't think i'll be repurchasing
i would say that it is about as effective as any regular moisturizer
i knew it would be lighter due to the "oil-free" nature
because of that i will not be repurchasing
i won't be repurchasing
still on the search
this product is an over-rated
i did not want to risk it negatively affecting my skin as well
to have it for travel
what a major disappointment from a company such as caudalie
i can deal with the scent
the main reason i cannot use it on my face is the smell
i still use it for my skin
would not repurchase this
i would recommend something else before using this produc because it is a temporary fix
the effect is only temporary
i don't see or feel any difference on my skin after use or after extended use
will give it a neutral
verdit: it is a complete waste of money
you also have to use a lot on your face each time
if you add another product on top
it will cause breakout
didn't control oil any better than other products similar
decided to try something cheaper from caudalie
love all of their products
i am currently on accutane so my skin is dryer than a desert
i would not recommend this product if you live up north
i would not recommend this product for people with any touch of skin sensitivity
this was a recommendation for my skin type
i really like the ingredients list
caudalie needs to print it clearly on the package that they use wheat based ingredients
like others have said
the only thing i like about the product is the applicator
know that in part it must be genetic
no help to dark circles and way over priced
i just purchased the all about eyes rich cream
only to find out after purchasing that this is tinted
fair price, but has a tendency to cake.
i hope that product will help
due to all the hype
limited my use to when i wear make-up
use their other eye
i expected to experience something
just hasn't been effective
see if the improvement continues
not enough to serve as a real concealer
the product says it takes 12 weeks to fully work
i trusted clinique's formula would be strong enough to have an impact
i've mostly held off on applying additional concealer so as not to rub off the product
t's not a total waste of money
on top of the zero results
i noticed no other beneficial reasons to continue using it
i definitely won't be repurchasing
did not like the newer bottle
one of the sales at sephora recommended me this
i saw no other benefits
i think its too pricey for its efficiency
assured me multiple times that this was the product for the job
despite my skepticism regarding the fact that it is nearly entirely oil-based
would suggest trying it despite my experience
this is a really reputable br
i will not repurchase
this was the only product that wroked
it is unfortunate that is advertised for all skin types
when i used this product in combination wth the alpha-beta pads that came along in the set wth it
continued to use this product on its own
having worked for a company that i know from time to time would go on sites like this for a product that they are repping
i think as a woman of color though i might need to go through at least two or maybe even three bottles to see some results because of the additional melanin in my skin
i will definitely repurchase
i prefer pumps because i always have this issue with products with droppers
if they change the packaging
i might consider repurchasing
don't forget if you don't like a product you can return it without the receipt for a full refund on a sephora gift card
may work for other people
if you don't have the receipt they will give you a sephora gift card with the money
high end products are a waste of money if you don't see any results
this one is cruelty free
the ratio of product-to-packaging is ridiculous
i think that can be improve together with the packaging
this means that when i try to pump some new product out
i think that it would have been much more effective if the product was packaged in a squeeze tube for good hygiene
this product was no different
prior to purchasing this product i used a sulfur based product which was great for acne
this is nothing special at all.
i should have researched before buying because as others have stated
it has done nothing at all in terms of clarifying
i should be using something for age defense
i didn't experience any significant or unique benefit after using the very expensive deluxe sample
there are other products that work just as well.
although considering the price i may have done myself a favor
this is your product
the results are inferior to quite a few other moisturizers i have used that are a third to half the price
wanted to see if stepping up to a pricier product would deliver serious results
good, but for the price, i won't repurchase.
i got it in a set of future response products.
i got this as a point bonus at my local sephora.
not sure this sample size will be enough product to determine the benefits
the main thing that will prevent me from buying is the smell
the effects aren't dramatically better than other moisturizers that are available at much lower price points
which i believe are ingredients
i simply cannot spend nearly $200 on a night cream
every time i go to sephora they have trouble finding products for my skin type
saying it was "all natural" first of all is not the least natural
your basically paying for all of the unnecessary loads of ingredients that can harm the skin
to me this cream is really average
i am sure i can pay $50 for something with similar results
the only positive is that you don't need to use a lot
it might be suitable for a younger 20-something skin
if i could leave this message on a more positive note
it is recommended to those who just want to spend money or use for using sake
i just had to post based on the magic people rave it performs
noticed the ingredients are different for other countries
i only give two stars because i loved the original product
this is no exception
pros: are just it's overall effectiveness
the smell to the application feeling is different
they must have changed the formula because my latest bottle has an unpleasant chemical smell
there was some promise with this product despite the amusing claim of camu camu being 30 times more vitamin c than an orange
without the inclusion of alcohol this would have been a totally different review
as alcohol is the second ingredient
i will continue using it
not to mention on its ingredients
therefore, i took the plunge.
despite the 80-something-dollar price tag
then apply to my face with my other h
i wish it could be applied like the other serums
i will use the remainder of this bottle
products at half the cost.
i saw no other benefits.
the only disappointing this is that the label says not to use it on your upper eyelid
which is the sole reason why i wanted this eye cream
it looks like many buyers have suffered the same sting that i did with this
regarding the actual benefits
although the product seems to work.
i used the sephora quiz to help me get the right product for my troubles which this was for my sensitive skin
i can probably find for cheaper price.
i love so many of the korres products
i won't be purchasing this product in the future
regardless of how little product i used
that is about it
the sephora skin rep recommended a similar product
i got it from the skin in bloom value set to find try new line
half of the claims are not true for my skin
i will not recommend this to my friends who have combo or oily skin nor repurchase in the future
will not be repurchasing
i would consider it basic at best.
i've had more success with other products
however, it is overrated for the price.
will still be purchasing other things they make
i will continue to use it as a spot treatment or at night
which is a bonus to me
none of their products have
perform better than western br
for the price it is
considering the lifespan of their other products
i would not recommend this to someone with my similar skin type
i won't be repurchasing.
as most products that don't work on my skin do
currently finding a new one :)
would have to replace it monthly
i believe the price it outrageous
the only reason i have this product two stars instead of one is the fact that it does brighten the skin
the jar does not open
will not purchase again very pricing to not have full use of the product
at the cost of this product that is just unacceptable
this might work for other people
yes it has an air lock system
for the price of this product
too new to see results
def sitting in the "do not use" stockpile.
ptr has products that are either a hit or miss for my skin
only use this product when i feel like my skin needs a boost
there is no way i could use this product consecutively without a high probability of my skin breaking out
still use many ptr products-
i expect more from a $70+ cream.
the product is not cheap
i give this product a 3 because it is non irritating
i gave this product ample time to work
this is where it belong
that sometimes when you use a new product
also, this line tests on animals.
though i feel like i should also get a refund for the time i spent trying to conceal blemishes from using this
night as it is recommended
i decided to give this pore treatment
i would rather explore other pore treatment options
this was a waste of money for me.
at this price i expected more.
i think the "intensive" part of the name must be in reference to the pungent smell it has
unwilling to accept that my visible pores are here to stay
i contacted a member of their staff asking if this treatment could address the discoloration of my pores
put down the $75 + tax on this thing
the black chunks throughout seemed to serve no purpose
leave this alone if you value your skin.
at this price point
that can be fixed by adding a few drops of water
i wouldn't recommend it since there are other treatments that can do the same job for a lower price
however my skin is combination
for a product that costs $70
sadly this is not the same product as the original
not the same formulation
no where near the same anti aging results as before
while the results were ok i wouldn't purchase for $69
i didnt see any results
not waste the money
you can purchase that online for 5 bucks
i used 100 of my beauty insider points on this
no initial "teaching" provided by sephora personnel prior to sale
following the steps outlined in the video only served to push my "bags of puffiness" around
which makes it difficult to apply
be careful not to apply to much product
additionally, i saw no results.
the application tends to over-apply
especially for what they charge for it??
the only plus is that it was coming with free gifts
only their makeup products are good.
the product is difficult to apply
want to give a fair chance
especially after all of the advertisements featuring this "new
i am still using
that kind of defeats the purpose
i received this product free from sk-ii to provide my honest opinion
at the current price point i would be unlikely to purchase this moving forward
more affordable moisturizers out there at local drug stores that do more for much less money
others in this line
for the cost of this i expected amazing results.
this cream is such a letdown.
would i buy it?
no, due to price alone.
i've tried products that range from cheap to expensive
'm starting to use anti aging products
i'd expect this product to at least brighten my skin
for my initial use
with products like this
i still continued use
following the directions to apply
just as with any product
trying it before investing in it
i received this product free as part of a promotion for the br
that in itself can already be a deterrent for some
simply because of the price
it is nothing special.
i'd give it 5 stars were it not for the price
i received this product for free to try
there are some major pros and cons to it.
"very counter space-worthy"
but the main question remains, does it work?
as for the product itself
there is no need to reapply
the directions tell me how to apply
it should have all of the above
i did some research
found very basic instructions for how to use the product
prior to applying any other products
would not purchase this particular product in the future
would consider trying a different sk-ii product targeted to oily skin
there are no instructions on the product packaging so maybe i've used it incorrectly
i feel that every product should have instructions
i can not justify the price in the future
upon receiving this product
they appear the same
i received this product for free from sk-ii in return for my honest review
since for the cost of this product i would of hoped for more
i most likely would not purchase this product in the future
because of the high cost
i am now on the hunt for that "fountain of youth" miracle product
*i received the product as part of a promotion from the br
with the initial application
when i apply it at night
when i apply it in the morning
at the price i was expecting more.
origins serums work just the same at a fraction of the price
not equal in value
the product is average
the face wash is already working so well to repair my skin
i don't think this cream is necessary especially for all the cost of the products together
does work to an extent
sephora offers many lines of skin care products
based on the description
hope sales reps would stop giving false information just to sell the product
i can buy $10 eye cream at the pharmacy store
get the same results
im giving it the benefit of the doubt
if i see improve i will repurchase
coming from someone who has struggled with mild acne i would not recommend this product
i don't foresee buying it again as other drug store br
i asume it was normal
it may work for some people
this product claims what everyone wants a clearing mask to do
bought the travel size as an impulse buy waiting at the register after seeing so many good reviews
i wouldn't buy again when i have cheaper products that work just as well or are similarly priced
which is how i will continue to use it avoiding the cheek area
as a paying customer i'm entitled to my opinion of the product whether favourable or not
those are literally all the pros of this treatment
also, not a fan of the fragrance.
it is different than other origins products fragrances
i found out that the 5th ingredient is alcohol denat
that's the reason for the poor rating.
if feels light when i apply
that was the same with this product.
yes 6 different oils in this product
i seem to have issues with origin products always breaking out
i suppose that is the cost of using a natural product
i ordered this moisturizer blindly
i get that there are specific ingredients that make it smell that way
this new formula does not work under make-up for me
it fails in comparison to the older formula on almost all levels except for scent
with this new formula i also have to use a lot more
did not serve its intended purpose
major problem: i believe this is formulated for men
if you are only concealing certain areas of your face
even if it were a temporary fix it would have been gapped enough
i spent $30 plus shipping for this product.
while in the store upon asking about oil control
i noticed the product was not oil free
this was a whole new level of red
it does say to apply as needed through the day
it was the complete opposite experience
i decided to use it on my normal skin
s to apply to my face
mind you, i use one to two drops maximum.
i've tried it with different foundations
does not help decrease cakeyness
that it does provide good coverage
which is unfortunate since i need the other product
spend your money elsewhere.
i do like the pump packaging
just wish a different cream were inside
this is without a doubt
i love other fresh products however
i will be keeping this
anti-aging benefits were also pretty high up on my list
that is about it
they don't say non comedogenic on the descriptions
also because i don't think the product is designed for that
for the price it is
for the price i expected more.
certainly could use some help with lifting plumping etc
not where i need the volume
i see no difference in my lines at all
because it is a pricey product that i will be returning because of no such results in weeks
i wouldn't purchase this
if i continue to see these kinds of results
i don't notice any other improvement to my lines
they are only a temporary fix
i will never purchase this product in the future
it seems to be doing them exact opposite of curing my under eyes
i see no results
i am a devoted philosophy user however
i like other philosophy products
will not be using this product
wasn't using it directly around my eyes
will look for similar philosophy products that go for full face
time for a new search under eye cream
i found this to be such a waste of money.
i did find it reduced fine lines
i see no results at all
i religiously put it on everyday
this was such a waste of money
i am tired of companies stating their products are non-irritating
i looked up the product details on paula's choice to find that the product does in fact contain eye irritants
it may not be the best option for those of us with dry
for reference i have light skin
i regret putting such high hopes into such a useless product
i will always recommend fresh masks
no change at all.
don't buy this product.
if you are pressed for time this is a terrible product for time management
feel it was a total waste
high hopes for the product
the actual product is completely bogus
which was recommended on the packaging
t could be fine using a different method
i will continue to use it
now that im using the light therapy less
i plan on continuing to look for something that works with my skin type
i may use this alone
had hoped this would help address the aging
i don't think the price justifies the results at that rate
i got this cream from redeeming the beauty insider point
also , give me many acnes.
applying it every other night
quick it is to apply
i won't be purchasing this again purely for this reason
not paying this much for a product that only semi-works for my skin
it was over the price range i generally am willing to spend for a moisturizer
i would recommend asking for a sample first to see if it works for you before shelling out this kind of money
this product has its pluses and minuses.
i would not recommend as a daytime
i tried waiting longer between applications
the fact that it's in a jar means the ingredients won't remain stable for long
i did not experience any positive benefits to my skin at all
this product is another failure in my search to find a moisturizer that works for me
didn´t see the results i expected
it is expensive for an average product.
waiting 5-10 minutes to apply my foundation
especially when you consider the price
overall i thought it was a waste of money
i will keep purchasing the other algenist products though
no use at all.
as others have said
for the price of this product
other algengist products really live up to their claims except for this one
it does not help with dark circles that are caused by genetics
don't spend the money if your hoping for this product to correct dark circles
i would not repurchase.
i do like the fact that the product comes in a pump bottle
would not recommend for the price
got a trial kit specifically for this item.
make eyes look older over the course of using the product
dennis gross has many other products that work wonders
the additional step in my routine
i've solved the problem by only applying it at night
nothing special at all
used the whole bottle without any improvement
i don't see any other improvements
i need something to improve the condition of my under eyes
i will not repurchase this product.
i really had high hopes for this product.
the consistency was easy to apply
i do however have some fine lines
don't think i'll be re-purchasing.
'll give it credit for texture
which many anti-aging products do
i also use it on other areas of my face
i don't know if i will repurchase
want to maintain it that way
compared to many other products i have tried
how can this possibly be an anti aging product when it is so drying
it was such a waste of money
i will not be repurchasing this.
not the most sanitary
if you are in need of intense
you can get that from any other
i would recommend buying the set instead of this
will repurchase unless i find something better.
i agree with some of the other reviews saying that this cream doesn't deliver on its promises
i don't think i will be repurchasing.
this so-called brighter eye treatment is an epic fail
it does not deliver any of its claims
save your money and try another product.
will not be repurchasing.
that is why i'm giving three stars
very average for me
e the change to this or the night cream i was using at the time
i agree with others on this cream.
i will be looking elsewhere
which was the reason for purchasing this particular item
it only does an average job of that
i will not be repurchasing.
the only positive comment i have to say is that your eyes feel fresh after application
i did not apply close to the lash line
won't be using this any more
i would not repurchase or recommend.
i rate it 2 stars because it does not deliver on its promises
i do not intend to re-purchase
i would recommend other
in an attempt to be patient
try a sample first before buying the product to make sure it works for you
i would have complained about paying $x for the amount you get
as others have stated
as others have stated
i add this to my foundations
could not find my receipt
i felt this would affect product integrity after a while
not purchasing this product is simply irresponsible
description say the product is designed for any dry area
never fully sunk in or provided any moisture or results
i will not repurchasing after my current one is finished
i think some other more affordable eye creams will be able to provide the same effects
something is wrong with the new formula
this is replacing it, and is an inferior product.
i wish they could upgrade the packaging game
the results are similiar to putting on a ton of moisturizer
pick off flakes is not satisfactory
effort in their products
customer satisfaction is #1 priority
i see other women had the same results.
so this review is meant for those
who would try this product knowing that the clinique name delivers high-quality beauty products
this is not one of those products.
now moving on to another product which
will no longer be "preventative
as a general rule i love clinique products.
i would give -1 if there is such option
the new version does nothing
i received this in a repairwear laser focus set.
i would spend the money on perricone
shisedo or lancome over this any day for actual results
this product is average.
it would attach to my face
on the nights that i do apply
it is simply average.
have been successful with other br
there was a promotion for clinique products so decided to try this one out
not what i expected with the "moisture surge" name
with many other moisturizers i have put on overnight
however this moisturizer that is specifically for overnight use has had no such effect on myself
i won't be repurchasing
it's also an easy job to apply on my face.
considering the amount of masks you can get out of it
the description says this product
when you apply the mask
fun to apply with brushcons: expensive
i love other boscia products as well
as others have said
wear this at night instead of this supercharge.
on another note all other boscia products i have used i have loved
the only use i could see for this is if your skin is in serious need of moisture
overall, i do not recommend it.
i would look for a product you can use all over your face
it doesn't go along with any other face products
s after applying because of it
i won't be purchasing another.
therefore realized it was this
other than the spf30 product i love boscia
i also would like more spf protection
clinique products before trying this
while i like this product
one of the sephora team members recommended this product
hence the two stars
t is difficult to find products that work for me without any problems
i usually have issues with other products/br
s in the past when they are labeled with spf
i will still use other boscia products.
white or any other kind
while i liked that this product is oil-free
i've purchased other products that are way cheaper
that give me the same results
is so full of quality ingredients that i'll just finish the bottle
i felt this was important to share
e it to any product
i think its important enough to share
i will be keeping this
drugstore oils do the exact same thing for me at least
both these instances happened to me.
you can apply foundation almost immediately
will continue using it a while longer
i would be a customer for life
it somehow implied that i should be using an additional moisturizer
i decided to use this product alone as a moisturaizer
it was really gross.
the only plus was the scent.
for the high price tag
buy a new serum for half the price that will give me some results
do not recommend using before makeup application.
the search goes on...
it was below average for me.
i still use other fresh products
i like a lot of their products
there are betters out there.
you better reconsider buying it
t had the potential to last long
hence the three stars
not at all what i expect from the ingredients in this product
there are less expensive cleansers that do the same
not for 24 hours as the product claims
i may look elsewhere for my skin cleansing products
i like other products from fresh
currently am not sure that i will repurchase it
i looked like i should apply to charlie's chocolate factory
there are other oils out there don't waste your time with this
i won't be repurchasing.
i apply this oil at night
if my skin benefits from this product i can get past the smell
or as a better option for nighttime
you at your own risk!
every single time i use this product i have breakouts on my face
for some reason this batch is really orange
cannot keep using it
i hoped that its shocking color wouldn't transfer directly onto my face
save yourself the cost.
i normally have success with shiseido products
i took a break from using this particular eye cream
because this is a new prouduct
i do like the packaging on the other product as you can put it in your purse to go
i am currently still using up the product
i don't see any difference from using a less expensive eye cream to this one
the search goes on...
for the money there are other products that work just as well
see no benefits or improvements with continued use
pricey product that does not deliver.
you are capable of better.
i don't know b/c there were no specific instructions on product if i was applying it correctly
i will continue to use it
this may be heaven sent for some users
had high hopes for this
1 oz is simply not sufficient for the price
there was no ingredient list
it simply said to refer to the bottle
the packaging on the sample is misleading as well since there is no mention of 'gradual self-tanner'
i'd recommend giving it a test run on a day when you don't have to be out in public
the color has not yet developed.
i don't care for the packaging.
went looking specifically for it
for the price i want results
would help with my skin concerns
how long the product lasts can justify a repurchase
i made a great deal of online research before purchasing any perricone product
i decided to try perricone's products to improve my sagging cheecks
don't spend your money in this overprized product
on the other h
i received this product free for testing purposes
this is the experience i had with this product
if i am going to add steps to my beauty regimen
otherwise it is a waste of time
this is precisely that.
i currently have a breakout that i would never get with any other product i've used
i also like that there are anti aging properties however as a primer
will be retuning this product
i know lancôme products are known for their scent
told me they don't even recommend lancôme skin products due to the high amount of fragrance
the fact that most customers cannot tolerate it
the product itself seems to work fine
it prohibits me from using the product often
for the cost versus benefits
i can get that effect by using a highlighter for 1/10th of the price
i no longer believe in purging
bottle: the pump is given to failure
i think i'll be switching to a different
i am at the age where taking care of your skin has to become a priority for good skin longevity
try a different product line
my only major criticism is with the packaging.
better packaging would have raised my review to four stars
for close to $100 i would expect actual results.
this was a waste of money.
the retinol is not a high percent per ingredient list
for the high price
expected more improvement in the powerful anti aging benefits described--not really any difference in about 4 weeks
my skin is the same
had high hopes for this
this product stings after i apply it
cannot even make myself use it any further
i did not find the results to be any better than any other nighttime product i have
i won't be repurchasing it because i find it unpleasant to apply
i will continue to use it
why this product has 4 stars
there is nothing advanced about this night cream.
it may work for others.
if they make a non scented version i might buy it
there are some other korres products where others find the smell terrible
will definatley not be repurchasing.
after i did some research on ouls
e to not using this product
i did use most of the bottle
it might work for others
this was the only new thing to my night-time regime
independent on the season
the spf in it isn't as great as other spf 30s i have used
it is such a strong smell that i refused to even put it on my face-- i tested it on my h
i don't notice any great improvement or benefit from using it
see original ingredients on beautypedia
they removed almost all the beneficial ingredients or moved them to the bottom of the list
fragrance way up in the list
the only positive aspect of this moisturizer is that is doesn't have the "fish scent" the other products the plasma line have
it needs to be in a pump bottle bottomline.
also made sure that any other serums i was using were dry prior to applying this
wish they packaged it with secure seal or something
unacceptable for the money.
even for my fair skin
despite what the description says
overall, i will be switching.
and this is without the foundation on.
whenever i apply it
i will not recommend this product
being on the fence about this product
all that being said
i also find that
ads claim it works
i wish the spf was higher
some may like that
most likely do to the alcohol
will stick with othe products
the reason i am giving it 3 stars is for packaging
i recommend the same for all
it might work for other people
takes away from some of the ingredients that could actually benefit skin
not impressed--there are much better options available at this price point
there are heaps of far better skin products available without silicone
actually deliver skin improvements
no way to fix it or save contents.
the lower eye cream is nothing special in any way
you could put the fountain of youth in faulty packaging
you could get yourself a real treat for the same price
after searching for many eye products to address
correct this i think its time i do something more invasive
buy some rosehip oil its nothing special the line has better offerings wouldnt buy it again
it feels exactly like the restructuring moisturizer from tata
will find something more cost effective
it sure likes to waste by using unnecessary paper/card for packaging
because i had been trying to build a more chemical-free skin-care routine
should fit the skin type
i'd say it is about an "average" to almost slightly below average for a moisturizer
a lot of makeup products are
it seems like this product has high ratings
t definitely resulted from introducing this product
strongly urge trying a sample of this mask before purchasing if you haven't used any products with ferments before
it may work for some
while i do enjoy it as i enjoy masking in general
the ingredients can be found in much lower priced masks
when you look at the cost of it
it isn't as effective as i'd hoped
wow are you paying for it
for that 1 oz at that price i'd just as soon go get an actual facial
tons of other similar products for way less money
find her entire product line overpriced for what it is
we need to remember that chemicals are cheap
this product i had some high hopes for
from my personal experience
i don't think this item's price tag is justified for the size of the pot
claims i expected something special
i would advise people to skip it
invest in something that may actually have an effect on your skin
my pregnancy skin could be to blame
could not continue to repurchase due to the price
would not recommend using this with your clarisonic
i really had high hopes for this product
there was certainly a lot of paper/card packaging
the directions suggested a one pump use for the face
order a ton of products only to find
just like all the other skin care products i've tried
quality is rather mediocre in comparisons to other affordable alternatives
i want to support this brand.
i hope it works for other people with different skin types
although the pump needs to be fixed
the pump wouldn't dispense any product
i finally got it to dispense some product after numerous tires
not travel friendly at all being in a glass bottle
why is this an allure winner?
fair shots at making it work
the price were high
s easy to get the product out
will not recommend for troubled skin
for the price tag
i felt like i needed 2-3 pumps at minimum
i decided to use less.
i would have thought that for such a high price
however, i will not be repurchasing.
most products you pay for is half the product
your skin looks the exact same after using it
your pores will look the exact same
just wasn't as effective
pump to get enough product for a single wash
the jury is still out on this one.
at a minimum i expect the dispenser to work properly
the lousy dispenser would prevent me from repurchasing
not encouraged to try any of their other stuff based upon this face wash
it leaks when you travel with it
there is no way to lock the pump
it may be a deal breaker in terms of me repurchasing it
i won't be repurchasing
the 3 is being given because of price.
there are many effective high end cleansers that are 1/2 or almost 1/2 the price
this is gentle enough to use daily if i chose to
wanted to love as i'm more interested in natural products
i read every single ingredient in every product
i am a fan of a few other products from the line
this one is a pass
would never buy bases solely on the smell
the high price tag is another con.
i reconsider buying this product if they change the scent
this is not product from an educated skin care specialist
don't know of its true potency
could not believe the price of this product
will not be purchasing
just looking at the ingredients i can see that it contains nothing remotely anti-aging
i would apply it beforeh
apply it before my makeup
it is easy to apply
t was pricy concerning the poor little function
refreshing when you apply it
you will need to apply something else on top
as others have stated
this is the only new thing i've added
will not be repurchasing
waste if money and time.
i will keep it as a backup
probably won't repurchase or recommend
other than that this alluminater is true to its word
am constantly trying new products to brighten my face
this is how they claim it to be brightening?!
i wouldn't recommend this product.
that all being said
i like ordering online.
maybe this oil has ingredients that are not compatible with my skin type
still love every other algenist product though
but i will not be replenishing this.
i'll probably keep getting the samples as long as they're available
i'd rather pay for other anti-aging products that have a lower cost
i stop using every face product
you can find cheaper products that will do what they claim to do
it is just so not worth such a high price for a common type oil made by many different br
i don't know what are the active ingredients here if this has peptides?
i find almost no difference
i still have all of the above after using this product
which i assume is opposite of its purpose
the jury is still out
i noticed my makeup would not blend well when i was using this product
perhaps there are people who do find it helpful
for the price point i would assume the packaging would be aces
i would do one or two pumps of product
like you have applied face primer
i will not be repurchasing it
call this a bad product
when you apply it
this item comes in a jar
after switching to different products
since it is the oil-free version
i cannot wait to switch to a different moisturizer
though it says oil free
different products work for different people
some people enjoy this
it still does after using this product
how this estée lauder eye care sells for $80 can.
i went online for official estée lauder website online it sells $75 can?
this sephora website it is a rip off !!
i cannot use it at all
i diligently follow use
not only does it not provide the results advertised
will be exchanging this for another a cream.
all skin around my eyes where i apply the product
decided to purchase the new kit that just came out that comes with the face serum
i don't physically see any improvements regarding fine lines
it seems like it stops making any progress after a certain point
which is rare for me since the only eye product i have managed to stick with was a $190 item from a certain luxury br
will not likely repurchase.
still in the search for my holy grail eye product
probably this is just my personal problem using the product
after applying i could feel the area tighten
never mind lauder raised the price by $8 by placing "multi-action" on the bottle
they changed the formula to where this long time user is now shopping for a new cleanser
so on top of paying more i have to wash twice thereby using more
i can't find a list of ingredients anywhere
i like the fact that you can also use this as a mask
l have no results at all to show
after only 1 month of purchasing even though the bottle says 12m
same results on the face
the only complaint i have is with the packaging.
now i have to buy a new bottle
this oil is as it says
i will most likely spend the extra $$ for the algenist
also didn't like the pump packaging.
although i use many of the caudalie products
this was not effective in removing all my makeup without needing to use soap
this is the product for you
not only will it require many cotton rounds of product for the simplest of makeup looks
because the product is not tested on animals
unlike a lot of other make up removing product
neither one is water proof
cause in that regard it works just d
the product is nothing special to my knowledge.
i've used better remover at more reasonable prices
giving the same effects
they all outperformed this brand.
i can find similar or better quality products for half the price
but it is not good for make-up removal.
i would not purchase this product
different make up or skin care product
definitely does not remove all makeup successfully
will not be purchasing
however, it fails to remove any eye makeup.
i will continue to use it as a refresher for trips or to keep in my purse after workouts
it created a stingy feeling throughout my face- will be returning due to that
that this is not oil based
so i tried a different brand i'm from honey mask.
gave me the exact same effects
for the price of this product
nothing special about it at all.
for the price though
which is a similar price
the results are subpar
i wish the fresh masks smelled as good as their other products
this product did not absorb at all
so the lady at the counter suggested that i should try the lotion version instead
i continued to use it
may work for other skin types
figured clinique was a safe bet
i will use the rest of the tube
realized that none of their products besides the take the day off oil works
i would not recommend this product to anyone regardless of their skin type
then choose another product that is more beneficial for the health of your skin
their other products do not contain this.
i apply it under my primer
not something that i'd buy independently of the ibuki set
i will say that this functions well as as an eye area moisturizer
i will not be purchasing again due to the price tag for an eye moisturizer :/
i recommend investing in a more pricier eye cream
this was a waste of money
the problem i find with most eye creme is that they take while to get absorbed
it consistently breaks me out every time i try to incorporate it into my routine
as i kept using it the results start to decrease as in my skin did not improve
whether or not it is effective
other than that the products great
i wish it will provide at least spf 30 protection
don't see a need of buying this again when i can get comparable moisturizers with spf 30 or more
the ibuki line is targeted for my specific age range
or 'dewey' as the packaging states on my combo skin
for the price i expect a product with more beneficial ingredients
i won't be repurchasing
this is not a product to be used alone
this is also not a cream
i won't be keeping this product
overall the product is just average
apply this right after the ibuki cleanser
breakouts aren't any different
s let alone my face
was hoping to find the same attachment to this moisturizer
recently i needed something to address the small breakouts i had been getting consistently
i actually broke out more--which may have been the purging process--
even after 10 days as indicated on the label
this product seems to work
i will not repurchase
sticking with it and hoping for results
these were a total waste of money.
would not recommended this product
i am not planning on repurchasing
the price is right
i wouldn't recommend this over other similar products
this product may work winners for some
told that they would act to reduce marks left by past acne as well as reduce future breakouts
gross usually has great products
tried this new product !
it won't be a repurchase for me
i prefer the orange one to this one.
hoping that for the price
it is such a ripoff
i don't know who has time to use this product on a weeknight
needed to use additional cleansers to get all of it off of my face
i also found that i still had tons of makeup on my face
there are so many other options that also remove makeup
i just don't see what is unique or great about this cleanser not to mention why anyone would pay the premium for the low quality ingredients
mineral oil is the first ingredient which is basically a guaranteed breakout for me
otherwise the product is fine
i would never recommend this product based off the smell alone
only have to apply to face
the only plus point i give is for the hydration.
save your money and pass on this product.
decided to invest in a high quality cleanser.
the first main ingredient is mineral oil which is the reason i now know why i broke out
an industry that i find cruel for many reasons
if you are sensitive to smell i would recommend smelling instore first by testing on h
it does the exact same job as this
ones that do not use animal products
if you care about the environment
there are many viable plant-based alternatives to petroleum-based products
all in all waste of money.
i wish i had purchased the moisture mask instead
how that would help skin?
i love most of the eve lom products in the travel kit that i tried
what is in this product??
the price point does not match the results of this product
use many of their products
trying to get the product out what a mission !
i also don't think it is a quality product
unless you have some genuine 'damage' to undo
wanted to get proactive about my skin
certainly there are better products with usable containers
maybe i have to use the whole product line to see major changes
i am comparing the lack of results to clinique's repair wear
i could achieve that with home made oils
i will likely continue to use clinique until i try a few new products from dr
i got this based on product description
love sephoras accommodating return policy!!
i tried to apply a little further to my lower lash line
i cannot comment on the effectiveness of the product
which i use on my face with no problem
most of them don't offer enough to make it worth the few extra minutes it takes to apply in the morning
i can get that from a drug store cream
i wouldn't recommend this product.
if you apply a generous amount
it will make it white where you apply it
i will continue to use what's left
none the less i will not repurchase.
the employee suggested this product to help correct my dark spots
when i try products like this i generally take before
can realistically gauge the products effectiveness
did not help reduce the look of current spots
i used the product very faithfully for what i would consider to be plenty of time to see some sort of results
this just was a total fail
at least not on my fair skin
after seeing the numerous commercial
had such high hopes
had to do much convincing on my own part to purchase such a pricey product
after seeing numerous ads for this product
it just lies on top of the other product
even though i was instructed by beauty experts at 2 different places to apply it that way
preventing any product from coming out
i gave this product a real try — i put other products on hold
could truly assess any changes —
this product was a complete waste of money
thought i would be safe
i notice when i use this
one of which was oil free
purchased shade 2 maybe i should give shade 3 a try
especially since it is only 1.7 oz for over $70.
however at this price
am thinking this is the only product in the line that has it in ingredients
i am now using this instead of purity made simple
is always red after using this product
it would be nice for someone to come out with a renewing cleansing product for someone with combination skin
i didn't notice a large difference in comparison to some of the other products i've used
it may have been irritated because i was trying lots of new face makeup
this mask is very average
i think for the price
i can get the same results with something cheaper
i couldn't justify keeping this at the price point
i wouldn't purchase this at all
i would not purchase
seriously such a waste of money
don't think the price is justified
i won't be purchasing
i personally will not be repurchasing
the directions also say that you can use this as a light layer over moisturizer
i expected more cooking
really upset to the foaming cleanser is no longer available in the us
i've own so many cleansers
this would be a total mess.
i find there are other more effective oils.
this is about average compared to the others
my main issue is the smell.
i do enjoy the process of applying it
it just isn't a product that seems very practical for daily use
which is no longer available
i only gave it 3 stars due to the way the product is packaged
therefore it should be less money because of this
s into not needing to produce more oil
i feel like the product is over priced
i will not be a repeat customer.
i feel like some of it is being wasted in the leak
the directions for this product say to use 2-3 drops per application
the dropper would not allow that
wasting a lot of product in the process
i didn't have a chance to evaluate the product's effectiveness because i couldn't work with the dispenser
i won't be repurchasing
like this would have this design flaw
however, i hate the packaging!
i will not be repurchasing
despite my love for the product
the packaging was fine there
if money is not a concert
cannot comment on how it works
the full ingredients are not shown here on sephora
i see several fragrances listed below
only reason i would choose this over a cheaper br
my only criticisms are the fact that it contains only one ceramide
would not buy this product.
i think because of the high amount of alcohol
this feels like any other basic eye cream
i wish it was more affordable
if you are hoping to purchase a moisturizer that will offer you visible improvements in your skin
s at a lower price point that can do the same thing
tried this on a recommendation from a super friendly
started to apply in certain areas
don't buy this one
i will continue using their regular daily moisturizer though
complete an utter waste of money
i generally want to like shiseido since it was the first br
not effective at all
i won't be repurchasing.
i still use it.
this makes me really wonder whether there are some undisclosed ingredients in this cream containing harmful
this is my new winter regimen favourite
as for the smell it has the least offensive/potent fragrance of those with similar constancy that i have used
also, least in price point too.
so had high hopes for this moisturizer
it says it will give you free blemishes
it says its for all skin types but its not.
when repurchasing my cleanser i figured i may as well buy the moisturizer also
i cannot imagine using this under foundation
consider yourself warned about what to expect
i need real results as an aging woman.
it did not see any benefits it promised such as anti-aging
something a $40 cream can deliver
i expected more from the dna
it may work for some
i don't think i'll be repurchasing this because of it
i would not consider purchasing this especially at the high price tag
whatever the org prices are for the other two
other than that my eyes firm.
i got this in a 500 point bonus purchase.
since my only main concern are bags
no such luck as of yet
instead next will be purchasing shiseido future solution lx eye
no such luck in that department
i wish i would have spent it on argan oil or something more beneficial for my skin
with such a high ticket price
may upgrade it if it works
this is the only one that i have found that i can use
drug store product was not
applied the remaining product
considering there are cheaper gels in bigger tubes available
i wish i could pinpoint the exact scent
i don't know if this is because it contains alcohol inside the product
wasting a lot of my product
i am not sure how its possible for the ingredeints to remin active???
t does its job on removing
depending on the type of skin you have
i will not purchase this
want my cleanser to be one-step
even the daily nature make up
will not be purchasing.
it says it will remove all makeup
its claims to remove makeup are false if you take my experiences into account
at this price-point it is a true disappointment
this cleanser seemed promising from the description
not all of their products agree with my skin
it is not well suited for overnight wear
long story short i expected to discover a new staple in my night time routine when i applied it for the first time because it seemed like it would extremely moisturizing
will probably explore other options once it's used up
it does its job
i only use it once a week because i opt for more anti-aging products
i would not repurchase
it is nothing special.
my experience is that the results
i'll use the whole tube, but i won't repurchase.
i know that may be a short time to grade the effects of this cream
as others have said
will continue my search for a product that does what it advertises
as i was told it would be an upgrade
i would advise you to be cautious
i think the ginzing cream is better in this respect
'm able to apply it generously a few times a day
am always looking to reduce or at least minimize them
i don't know which ingredient is responsible because nothing stood out in the list as burny
i'll be tolerating this product until it runs out
the only reason i'm giving it two stars
that is the only way to describe it.
i did some research
i decided to buy this product
i will not repurchase this item
i will keep searching.
this product doesn't meet either of these requirements
cannot comment on the over-all longtime use benefits
for something that price i expect at least be hydrating enough
i still plan to continue to use other algenist products
i will finish because expensive
to many good products available.
i will not repurchase this product
this moisturizer does nothing to warrant the expensive price tag
in terms of actual skin benefits
actually encouraged me to use it faithfully at night
no one will have the same response to anything we apply to our skin
i just cannot justify the price of this product
unfortunately it did the opposite of the promises on the label
wouldn't say no to more free samples
i won't be paying for this price for this mask
the true test will be tomorrow with how my makeup applies
ill buy fab products, but not this mask.
even after multiple application
if you are considering purchasing it
the representative at the store helped me pick out this mask based on my criteria to reduce pores
i also found it difficult to spread the product on my face
my three issues with this product were: 1.
by the opinion that for someone with the right skin-type
this mask is nothing special
for those who is thinking to purchase this product
one thing i will applaud it for is that the mask is non-irritating
supposed to be a part of a natural line
returned all 1st aid beauty products that have phenoxyethanol in them
pick those off individually
fab needs to work on the delivery of the product
i am not a fan of peel-off masks in general
the ingredient list reads more like a science experiment than a face product--lots of chemicals
this one is a no-buy for me
its claim of having red clay in the ingredient list is a joke
the product is fun to apply/remove
i find myself reaching for another product to address those issues
i'd choose a clay mask in the same price range over this cleanser
not looking to attack any specific skin flaws
will not be repurchasing.
you can get washes that do the exact same for much
i would recommend this for normal
to be honest it makes no difference for my breakout continues until i left vn for the us
had some special treatments
one more plus to finish on a positive note
this one is no different
the cap on each one doesn't close properly
or need to travel with it
probably from the inclusion of clay in the formula
i used a good majority of it
only two products have ever produced results: an expensive serum that shall remain nameless
it will not dispense.
the latter i cannot.
hoping that consistent use of this product will wipe it all off :
i would think this is a total waste of my money
it does not provide enough hydration through the evening
do beware of the shelf life of this product
on results alone i would've given this a 4 or 5
i'd still recommend it for anyone with normal skin
these were very different than the typical acne i am used to
i won't be repurchasing.
i would tolerate it if the product worked
my only issue is the amount for the price.
have also the mask
unlike many other creams i tried
one of the employees recommended this eye cream instead
the only good thing i can say to its favor is that it applies well
2 stars needs extra applications trough our the day3
i would rate this product as average
if money was no object
at that price point
for us "mature" women
did not pay a cent for it
was swayed to purchase this product at more than double/triple the cost
don't mind the price tag
i'll search elsewhere for a product that st
s up to its claims
which is not permanent nor will yield long time results
it accomplished none of these
was trying a few prospective products
nor did i find my skin any better off than with basic creams
try to be careful with which products i choose
did the same job in a more effective way
my eyes aren't more firm
for the price, i expected more.
new one from the latest honey collection just released
so do other products without the disappointments
i don't like the association of "milk" on my face
could just focus on enjoying the product
i'd love to use this daily
especially if you are to apply makeup after
i feel it would be best for overnight use if excessive oil is an issue
i notice lots of other people are having this problem
invest in good skin care products
it works for someone
not good, i'm sticking with the original.
i won't be purchasing.
nothing mind blowing nor life changing for its price
i can get the same hydration from a cheaper alternative
there were many claims in the description box that you would see results after one use
i applied the product to my face
had high hopes for this treatment
this product was one of them in the kit
the price is way out of line for the amount of product that is actually in the bottle
will not be repurchasing
will not be repurchasing
i've found better results with other cheaper products
just isn't compatible with my skin
with all the hype surrounding the glamglow line
i saw nothing different with my skin as i did with other moisturizers
but the cons outweighed the pros big time.
checking the ingredients only confirms that they're seriously overcharging for something that just
saw a lot of people with the same type of skin as mine were using it
i suggest a different product
try one of the other ones as you'll be happier with the results
over this specific one
overall i wouldn't recooked this
i think that in this price range there are many other masks that are actually effective
i don't see evidence of increased value for the price
i decided to invest in this cream.
for the price i expected and hoped for more.
that is just unacceptable for a product at this price
for the 10 seconds you are applying it
with that price tag?
will continue to use it in the hopes that some of it may be absorbing
if i see improvement, i will change my rating.
please don't assume user error on this one.
why can't they add the new ingredients to the old formula
i see that i'm not the only one that experienced this based on a review below
i wanted to fall in love with this like i did with most of their other products
i do see results from other products in the amount of time i've been using this one
this one for some reason makes my eye to water
this shseido one has the right amount of spf
for some reason sephora priced it a bit higher than shseido website
that's why i'm deducting two stars here
its just an extra unnecessary step.
this product was a total waste of money for me
there are other products that will serve this purpose without the burning sensation
i still prefer other removers compared to this one
will leak everywhere if you use this for travel
i will not repurchase this item.
no due to the fact that i want to try other makeup removers
the fact that that i could use it to remove eye
will be repurchasing the take the day off eye makeup remover to h
not realizing it was a different product
i find for the most part that there products are high quality
this is difficult to apply
in addition to being all around useless
i continue to try different products that make claims
for the amount of product you are getting
i decided to give this a try as i am so self conscious of fine lines
i tried several times to apply it directly from the tube
thank goodness sephora has such a generous return policy
it was a complete waste of money.
'm just using this as a normal primer that doesn't create any specific effect
it was a waste of money!
the price point was so high
am sticking with benefits porefectionist
that gives me the same result as this product.
this product was such a miss
take the amount you picture being there
fine lines i used a good amount of product
save your money unless you have extra money to throw at this product
i usually loooveee all of their products
the stick was so hard to apply.
do not invest in this product
it could be that my foundation's ingredients don't mix well with the lancome visionnaire
i will use the remaining product from time to time
i will not repurchase
it is not the same product there is no scent
?i'm returning to the store to inquire further.
while i like the product
i'll have to say no on this especially with the high price tag
it is very average.
this should cost $30 tops.
i will likely not be repurchasing.
add this one to the list also
in order for this to be a beneficial product for the skin the need to reverse the ingredient list
to the grocery store or something for some light coverage
depending on what are your searching for in your day cream
have to wait before i apply any makeup
there is not a store that is convenient to me
not intensive in my opinion
this seemed like a good alternative to the jar cream
you do not get your money's worth if it has to be repurchased that often
not if i have to repurchase that frequently
this product should be reserved for the young.
doing some research online
considering this is only a 1 ounce bottle
i be fair i tried with three different sunscreens
was hoping that this would be a less expensive alternative
am still getting daily coverage
this moisturizer is simply average
so while the effects are similar to the cream
it also "rolls" when you apply any other lotions or makeup on top of it
as is always the case with fresh products
because of the high ratings that it has
along with the price
for the cost it is just your basic mask
click sort by highest rating
you will see many of them only comment on perricone md products
i'd rather drop $140 on the sisley black rose because it does work
for what you get in terms of value
most of the 5-star views seem to be from users who only review perricone md products
at this point i don't see myself repurchasing
not wildly different from the other zillions of masks out there
beware the oil-free label!
for the price, i expected more.
i would probably repurchase for the spf.
given my combination skin
this product was recommended to be by one of the sales consultants
i don't think i'll repurchase because i am not dealing with digging product out of the cap every day
this is such a disappointment
is a really sub par product
i wasn't that familiar with the brand.
disguise lines or help at all
i would say buy a cheaper eye product with better packaging
provides minimal coverage which is nice since that's not what i'm purchasing this for
there r other products that have the peach correction
how easy it is to apply
although the same effect could be achieved with a cold spoon
only thing that i like was the way the product felt once you applied it with the metal part of the applicator
makeup" looks for running err
i also don't see any differences
no "eye treatment" results at all
think i'm still in the process of a true
it hasn't been a total game changer
the price on the other h
if it weren't for the quick expiration
the box included this product
i recommend using this post-shower
don't even look at the price tag
a lot of product is needed in order to see results
i did some research
the directions say to apply with circular motions
it wasn't even available for purchase
i know there are lots of beneficial ingredients here
expectations for this product
on the other h
there are much better creams available
now i wear foundation daily
if you prefer a cream that you apply
i would spend the extra money to purchase the ren cleansing balm instead
i will be refunding
repurchasing the balm instead
when i use the other ptr masks i can see an almost immediate difference in my skin
would suggest passing on this
splurging on the 24k mask instead
i would not repurchase or recommend.
i tried to follow the other recommended application method
buy something that works
this product does work for a brief amount of time
of course this is only my opinion.
being roses their main ingredient
apply on my face
i see no 'repairing' effects as the product promised
i will have to start using proactive again
i prefer to use it as the night treatment as opposed to the regular mask
you get a lot of product for the price
i don't think i will be repurchasing
please sephora stay honest with your customers
some people have the same reaction
please be careful when you choose this product.
despite the high price decided to try this
so the sales rep in sephora suggested this 'amazing' product
the problem with this is
a reaction to a product doesnt only have to be on the area you apply it
please keep in mind.
agrees with your skin
i realize these are made up words
there is no avoiding the waste of it
i want to switch between that
i don't care how many different rose essential oils they claim are in the product it wasn't useful to me at all
as i've been using it i often find myself reading the massive wall of text on the bottle
or whether/how the active ingredients have any efficacy on human skin
however i have also read that glycolic acid/bha/ahas need to be left on the skin for a few minutes at a minimum in order to have any effect
i think i'm what cosmetics companies label as "experiential" — the experience of using it carries almost as much weight for me as the results
i encourage anyone else to sample it also
my skin disagrees with this specific product
i usually don't have acne only the monthly ones
i also had a reaction that many others had with this makeup
i just now read on the perricone website that they are coming out with new shades of the serum
please consider making this in other shades
this should say, only for fair skin!
will not be repurchasing
on the other h
a poor choice on my part.
i won't re purchase it
it gives no coverage at all
the original no foundation foundation
i tend to use the original foundation daily
i will keep both
i think the "no foundation" foundation works in theory
as they did with the no foundation foundation
it claims to be "no foundation foundation"
if it says foundation it is foundation.
the only reason i am giving it 3 stars is that it only comes in 1 color
please make a fair to light version
after looking at the ingredients list for this foundation
if i had been aware of the information i know now
i would not have purchased this product
i take issue with products that only make one "universal" shade that are really only suitable for folks with light skin
the fragrance samples i did want are still on the websites as options
they ingredients were not listed on the package
ingredients were not listed on the packet
as other reviews have stated: no-no for acne-prone
beware before you buy it!
have been a longterm advocate of their products
will continue to use other products from the range such as the rosewater spray which is wonderful
every night i apply this oil instead of my josie maran
the product itself feels almost 'watery' in comparison to other oils i have tried/preferred
make sure you try a sample of this before investing in the product
i will not be purchasing.
had high expectations for it
it was one of a few products you can also apply under the eyes
for such an expense product i expected immediate results
like all of tata's products i have tried
other than that, don't waste your money.
there is a return policy?
i don't have the receipt
realized i needed to discontinue it
i don't think i'll be repurchasing.
only redeemable quality is that it smells nice
cannot comment on that
i keep buying products with heavy fragrances for some reason
this product has not provided a resolution for my issues
for the price point i don't see a reason to repurchase this eye gel
refreshing when you apply it
i did not find it affective.
however i will not buy this product
it does burn immediately after application
the product works when it wants to
as i continue to use it
personally i think that speaks volumes about a products effectiveness or worth for the money
i find that to be the case with all of fresh's line
i actually think that in the duration of using this product
what a complete waste of money.
it just wasn't compatible with my skin.
i would not repurchase or recommend this product
it was not effective at all.
i'd be interested to try it again using the origins maskimizer to see if that amps the results at all
waste of money would not repurchase...
use in combination with drug store br
s to reduce the cost
would rather have a six pack of those than this for the same price
the two step process
i tried this mask/patch more than once with the same unsatisfactory results each time
i would recommend just using a drugstore alternative
boscia is good for upkeep.
sephora will give refund on products that don't work for you
i've used 100s of skin care products
there was no strip just the solution
given the high price point
i cannot more negatively review this product.
go into any drug store
i cannot see any improvement after using this product
please sell them separately!
i agree with others
save your money and skip this one!
33 oz night cream would be unjustifiable for me
i hope that they consider changing the packaging.
i'd hesitate unless they upped the amount in the package or lowered the cost
i share the mindset of so many of these reviews for amorepacific's dual eye creme
i am giving this product 3 stars.
please sell them separately.
i received 2 dual packages.
so wish these were sold separately
no way can i justify buying the combo
please sell as seps or correct the am formula.
was willing to stray from caudalie premier cru eye cream
three stars only for packaging
please amorepacific--separate these creams
it did change into a different consistency
try literally any other glamglow product.
i would recommend trying another product from the lineup rather than this one
i've made it a mission to try every glamglow mask
am on a mission to try everything
you apply it to already clean skin
i didn't notice it doing any additional cleaning or making any difference at all
i would like a warning
don't plan on looking all bumpy a week where i won't be in public
not a life changing product
gents should steer clear of this product
no long term results on my skin
possibly for only 10 minutes if you have sensitive skin to reap the benefits
now, it could be user error or faulty pump.
if i had to get another anti-aging
you would think both sides would be equal
i would equally use a pump on each side
better packaging would be appreciated!
5 stars for the product
one side would not dispense properly.
i couldn't quite believe it was the serum responsible for this
i therefore cannot give this product anything more than one star
i think i'll be looking at other br
i did find the dual pump easier to dispense one side at a time
unfortunately the dispenser does not give equal amounts of product from both chambers
the other annoying thing is that it is very unclear as to whether one should apply this product under the conducting gel before using the nuface device or not
i am realistic in my expectations
there may be possible benefits that can't be observed on the surface since peptides are anti-aging
yet still charged the same amount
i would not recommend this eye gel for nightly use
i get the new look.
have yet to see any changes or prevention
maybe if i were younger it would receive a better review
i find it works for the most part
don't waste your money on this product **very sticky**
bags were still there
this one needs improvement
i'll continue to use the product since it is supposedly for prevention
i am new to eye cream
i will not repurchase
i don't recommend this product at all.
that was the only benefit for me
i expected to possibly see some of my eyebag reduction
i don't recommend buying this product.
would not recommend or repurchase.
the results aren't lasting
for the price i think there are other options that work better
which say to apply morning
decided to give these a try since they were also highly recommended by a sales associate
this product deserved two stars from me for twofold
believed that this would yield similar results
nothing could be further from the truth.
i will be returning it to my local sephora store.
i would not repurchase
i chose this product because it had the word "replenishing" in the title
hence giving it two stars.
yet despite both these factors
one the 110 price point
the spots are still there
i won't be repurchasing
at that price i can't see buying it again without any additional benefits
depending on your preference
for this cost i want every drop of product
please think twice about buying this product
spend your money elsewhere.
i believe in investing in your skin
if money is no issue for you then i highly recommend this product
i expected more from clinique.
the product does make an insane amount of promises
do i see any long term effects toward my face
there are more affordable serums out there that will achieve a very similar result
if your main concern is fine lines
you should just spend your money on repair laser focus instead
it was like an ordinary cream
replacing them with inferior ones like this
so cannot comment on liquid
at the same time so does almost all other makeup removers out there
this oil didn't really meet the expectation i had from the other oils
the cost of this is truly high
there aren't lots of beneficial ingredients or anything lasting about this cleanser
will do the same thing for truly a fraction of the price
not planning on rebuying.
in the store i test it out
i tried two different higher end primers
the amount of packaging they use is positively ridiculous as well
will keep using those
the sales person insisted i buy this instead
wanted to try something cruelty-free
i trusted that this cream would be just as soothing
even with two applications
like it was alcohol based or something
don't waste money on this.
i wish i could attach a picture.
i enjoy trying new creams although i know that none of the creams will work miracles including this one
i do not believe that it could help sagging skin due to the normal aging process
all these creams are just money makers
none have been perfected or proven to actually work
i see no benefit.
the only reason why i rated this product 2 stars
the packaging is not suitable for it's consistency
i don't mind to have it in the end of the list
i don't like when someone lies to me trying to advertise the product
after using it, i did see some immediate results.
perhaps it was using it in combination with other cleansers
it says to use every other day.
i would give it zero stars if that were an option
'd recommend using caution when testing this product
this treatment did not have any beneficial effects on my skin
if you're interested in trying this
i agreed with the firmness
decided to switch to an alternative
these breakouts are all over
at the same time alcohol denat is very high on the list
thus i can't justify buying the full bottle
i only use it as a primer
i tried this as part of a shiseido rewards kit
if you read the ingredients you will see that the second ingredient is alcohol
my skin did grow upon the first application
there is no need for this at all
which means i lose $50
had high hopes for it
like on it's own or at different times of day
waste of 200 points in my opinion
i received this concentrate as a gift
went to a competitor website for how to remove which is "tissue off excess product" btw
you have to look online
this one isn't satisfactory.
as others have said
i would recommend a different product
the smell is not offensive or too strong
i felt like there were cheaper alternative out there to try
as well as a recommendation from a seph
got the cheaper alternative
am determined to use it up
once you apply water
i will use up the tube i have
i wish i'd found out more about it before purchasing
the scent is not offensive
i am currently using sheshido
i will purchase another gel to oil cleanser because i think they are great
i do like to love some of the other algenist products
i will give the other products a chance
this is a total miss for algenist.
maybe i'll see this in the 99 cent store soon with all the other worthless creams
i decided to upgrade to the genius eye cream
i'll stick with the complete eye renewal cream for the future
the main reason i am only giving this 2 stars is that after these weeks of regular use
i would recommend asking for a sample before shelling out the money for this hit or miss product
hoped that it would be an improvement on my current eye treatment product
i would not purchase.
as with most other algenist products
this eye cream could not deliver on promises to firm
there are a multitude of far more effective products on the market at 1/3 the cost
i chose this eye cream over numerous other eye creams because it was the only one i could find that didn't give me an "oil slick"
i'd probably find a cheaper alternative
decided to try a less expensive option
there is superior eye creams on the market for this price tag
i would not pay for this product
i primarily purchased this in hopes that it would hydrate
which is more than i can say for other products i've tried that promise the same results
i love using both of these together
however the packaging can be improved.
i like these types of products
i followed the instructions from the packaging
there are a lot of oil cleansers that are available in pump bottles sold by almost every skin care line now
instead of being able to do one measured pump
not recommended, had to return the product!
will try one of their other cleansers.
i might find use for this as an eye area remover only
because this would have been a waste of money
i continued to use the product
at least in the clear areas
note: i am certain it was this product
i recommend many of ole's products
would be an idea product for my face if it came in a tube or bottle with pump
for now i am using a product that doesn't work as well just to avoid this packaging
i check for new packaging every time i go in to buy new facewash
this wouldn't be a bad starter
there are many other cleansers out there that i'd turn to before this one
you can open them with the product on them
oil-based cleansers have always been hit or miss for me
this one is a catastrophic miss
would have been nice to see ingredients on the website because i wouldn't have purchased this
it has really no beneficial property for the skin
coming from such a luxury/pricy company
due to ingredients in this product
i am a one-step person
this product is $32 which is not the special cleansing product it could be for that price
another sephora employee said that it will not work well on customers in their 20's
to be careful because if you don't apply spf on top of this product
if i would apply this the same day before i applied eyeliner
willing to pay the price
now i must find another eye product to repair the damage
it had all the right ingredients.
at least upon application
be advised that dimethicone is number 3 in the list of ingredients
this is no different than the rest of origins products
i will not be repurchasing
i will use it all because of the price factor
i would have given it zero stars
for the amount that they are selling it
based on whether hyaularonic is an ingredient
without having the extra ingredients i don't care for
i won't purchase more when i'm through with this jar
would have gotten 5 stars if it would have been dimethicone free
after the time i apply the product on my skin
this is a decent entry from origins
but there are two problems with it.
i love estée lauder products for their consistency
i struggle with darkspots all the time
this will do the same
does nothing for fine lines or dark circles i have found no difference from using this line
i like that the pump gives you the exact amount each time so there is no waste
i would recommend it to someone with more normal/combo skin
it also does not remove makeup at all.
only useful if you want to wear no perfume
i would have preferred no scent
i only gave it two stars because the delivery system is really easy to use
seems to administer the correct amount each time
at $120 a bottle it's too expensive to repurchase to continue trying
which is preferred in the morning before makeup
will not be purchasing the actual product in the future
there was enough for two applications
decided to purchase a set including that
i did a super scientific test of this on one half of my face
because of this products price
i got this product when i have a 10% off coupon.
i spent all this money on such a tiny product that did not help my pores at all
which is preferred in the morning before makeup
will not be purchasing the actual product in the future
why is it in a clear bottle?
nor how little of the product will actually dispense from one usage to the next
with all the hype
used these products in a combined solution as suggested by skin inc
you spend less on the pure version.
there are also better mixes depending on your issue
the chat seems to always be unavailable
i got it as a deluxe kit with a purchase
i also did not notice any benefits of the product
i will be returning since moisture was my primary motivation for buying
using it per their directions
which means that even if the ingredients listed before it were preservatives
talk about taking your money.
i love the little dots of product within product is appealing
love the overall design of the brand.
for the price i will stick with my retin-a
it has a lot of alcohol in it
or black tea bags or some other much cheaper depuffing methods
find they deliver what they promise
i will still purchase ren products
could not see any difference with the "tightening" this product claims
it hard to apply primer over it
i don't see any improvement after one bottle
i wouldn't recommend to anyone or repurchase this item
i am one of those people who have to change cosmetics all the time
save your money, don't buy this.
i disagree completely with the description that it plumps or works as a primer
i added in this product
if you look at the ingredients list
that it could be a cheaper alternative for my lancôme visionaire
i think it is nice to use in certain targeted spots
i found this product to be so overwhelming in scent
will not re-purchase due to smell.
i will stick with my simple water over this one.
now on the other h
i mainly sought this product to take off my eye makeup
i love fresh i have been using their rose
bought this product on the recommendation of a sephora employee when i requested ideas for a new toner
this is a product that might get 3 stars if it billed itself as simply a toner
many of the other reviewers seem to use this as a supplement to their usual routines
it may work fine that way
on its own as anything
the results were average.
no product can do that regardless of their promises
with certain fresh products
i will add the price tag is so high for something that is basically a heavy
overall, i am still trying the mask on.
the other con is the price.
i need like five different masks.
i probably wouldn't repurchase.
i do like many of their other products
i am trying to address dryness
not at all the miracle product most reviews live it up to be
invest your money elsewhere.
creating urgency that we have to buy something
now i have to use it as crazy expensive h
i wouldn't recommend this product
won't repurchase at this price point
while i do see improvements in fine
i cannot report any difference
it may work for some people
i didn't find this product useful at all.
ii would see a difference around my eyes
this one isn't cutting it for me
it has not delivered the extended result it promises
i will buy needles no more
i am starting to develop some fine wrinkles/lines
or look for another product that'll actually help with aging concerns
when i apply this product
this product does work--or at least temporarily
$90 for a 1 month supply is a bit high.
i saw 0 improvement, long term or short term.
the price point made me iffy about purchasing
it was no longer available for purchase at my local sephora store
had to order it online instead
for some reason i see virtually no changes after use whereas with the sample i could see changes immediately
especially given the price point
i received this for free from sephora
don't expect it to be youth in a bottle
another is deceiving your customers
this was a complete fail for me
my skin must have adjusted to whatever's in it
it is a waste of money
if it allowed me to choose no stars for the rating i would have
however i expected something for such a high price tag product
i've used many beauty products
as well as the promise
that's some selling tool
the are many products that promise to 'blur' lines right now
they do so by giving the product a certain consistency that works with light
with a product such as this
even the temporary illusion that come be part of the promise-- in line with other 'blurring' products-- is not true
put the tm sign next to it
for buyers who are more gullible
the higher price is further deception that it is expensive because it works
there are many other options out there
the product name is deceptive.
it's too expensive to use without providing any long term benefit
the cost is high
stop myself from purchasing
happened to be in the market for a new face wash
well, this did the complete opposite.
the actual cleanser product itself worked really well
the packaging needs to be changed immediately
i think this is another problem with the pump/packaging as well
the pump is a fail.
generally receive compliments on the health/tone of my skin
the product also did not lather/foam despite following the two different instructions on the bottle versus the package insert
i'd give the product itself 4 stars.
i hope glamglow will fix the dispenser
repeat every time you wish to dispense product
if the both of us have had the same issue i'm sure many others have experienced this as well
for a product from a high end br
so you can take this review with a grain of salt
is the reason i will not be repurchasing
i will not be recommending this product to anyone
and i use another product instead.
i don't like products that have to be applied in a very specific way to even work at all
considering the price of this product i find this problem to be inexcusable
i think that it is just way to expensive for the basic job that it does
im giving this product only one star because the pump on the bottle is faulty i could not get the product out of the bottle
was challenged by a sales rep to try the product for 3 weeks since according to clarins 3 weeks is what you need to change your skin with this oil
i can see why people choose this product.
i like the package
i found an ecocert certified oil-based cleanser that works better for less than half the price
i rarely return products
all were a complete fail
as soon as the product is applied to the face
a waste of money in my opinion.
it's past the "transition" phase
out among other creams in its price range
which doesn't compare with the price point
please consider making a fragrance-free version of this
i will look into other moistuzers
i think there are some perfumes in this
i might save it
receipt i would return
which is kind of the opposite that i expected
i wanted to like this product due to the price tag
this stuff is total junk
this is something different
apparently this is the newer version or intended to take the place of eye hope
not the same potency
unlike the original hope in a jar
for someone older hoping for the "renewing" results the eye cream promises
at $51 for less than an ounce
this "renewed" is not as effective as the old eye
so soothing that i continued to use it
it may have other uses or benefits
doubt i will see any benefit
i received this as a 100-point perk
at the moment i'm disinclined to repeat-buy this product
while a good product it doesn't merit the price
in addition to the other stuff i use
there are more affordable solutions
i wouldn't recommend it or promote it as something that will help your acne either
started implementing those methods in my routine
now i am starting to realize how unnecessary it is
there are cheaper alternatives for removing your makeup
i don't believe the price reflects the value of the product
made the effort to find my receipt
i also prefer to see the oil in a transparent bottle just my own pet peeve
i still prefer to be surrounded by products that you would not find on a gr
not as effective as it claims
i believe there are drugstore alternatives that could do the same
decided to use one pump of this oil
try to apply over all this combination
since i'd had such great experiences with other de products
all skin types are different
i wasted the first part of the bottle by not being consistent
i want to give this product five stars
5 stars for the product
however, i am giving this product only 3 stars.
not sure if the two are related
i won't be recommending it to anyone
will continue to find something more cost-effective
i don't recommend this product for this skin type
all in all set was a good idea as i am new to the line
it comes with 5 different products to try out
i will also note that drunk elephant calls this ph balanced
in my skincare research i've always seen it recommended that a cleanser's ph ideally shouldn't be much higher than 5
a real drunk elephant would be more useful to the world
either way, i won't be repurchasing.
i probably wouldn't repurchase
like many i got the travel size duo with peekee.
will not be repurchasing.
instead of using this on a regular basis i'm going to give a semi-regular basis a whirl
except for certain areas
i will continue to use the wash
i will try other products from this line
i will not apply the bar directly to the face
this product was such a waste of money
the fact that it is an oil
product by a different br
both products were the same price range
have similar skin care promises
or perhaps it was a promotion
she got some sort of recognition for extra caudalie sales that day
purchasing the other instead
wish it was thicker or had different application process
apply with my whole h
tread with caution if you use this product
from my own experience
older after a few usages
why am i spending $99 to look older?
have not notices superior cleansing power or long term results
i realized that if i apply to everywhere
won't be repurchasing this
will continue to use it.
to each there own on that determination
i expect a product to deliver on hype
was disappointed to see fragrance listed so high in the ingredient list
they try to advertise this as a "natural" product by stating that 80% is made up of natural ingredients
i wanted this to work because the ingredients are there
this was one of those rare leaps of faith
i won't repurchase this
it was a waste of money.
had high expectations from it
i wouldn't recommended it.
found it to be average in performance
i've had other products that performed the task better
consider the other negatives-
if you are willing to spent around $40 to make your under-eyes soft
the gimmick benefit was selling here
on the benefit site
has no long-term benefits
this is for you
if you are in your 20s or older
i would suggest clinique rollerball for better
this thing is a waste of money
however this product isn't a game changer
i won't be repurchasing
the packaging was also poor
i will not repurchase.
would not recommend or repurchase.
which is i main reason for using it
i do think the price is steep
won't be repurchasing it if i find a cheaper alternative
this product did provide any instant results like it claims
overall, i would not recommend this product.
almost seems like they just repackaged high beam as an under eye treatment
the other off for not being a game changer
not having easy access to the all-in-one eye cream i used to buy from my old salon
will not be repurchasing
i find they use ingredients to do quick fixes.
i did not see an immediate effect nor after 7 days of using the product
therefore will be returning
with items that do not deliver
jacking up the prices on mediocre products
i will no longer be a customer of the brand.
i think they are trying to market to teens
i am now signing off on all benefit products as this is the 3rd product that promises so much
yet another product promising to correct a specific area that doesn't work
this product is different than any other eye cream i've used
this is the second benefit product i've had to return recently because the fragrance was too strong to tolerate
i likely won't re-purchase this product.
light as you use it
including all the necessary
a drug store face wash does the same thing as this
most likely won't risk buying this.
i would recommend it
true products for now
otherwise i would have given it zero stars.
no results at all
while origins as a line targets consumers in their late 20s
will continue to use them instead
i've found other serums for almost half the price that are natural
i think i would be more dedicated to using it if i was actually noticing major improvement
i definitely recommend the mask instead
also still might battle acne
i think there are more suitable serums for me out there
it might be great for a nighttime treatment only
not a deal breaker as it says to follow with lotion
not sure if it warrants the price
the serum would give me all the benefits that everyone had been raving about
are just in the process of wanting to take care of your
why is it all gold?
get the same results
i'll continue to use it as i don't like to waste it
i will not be repurchasing after it is empty
i will not be re-purchasing
i would agree with the others that it is more of a primer
i will not repurchase
will not be repurchasing
i will continue to use this as a primer
this is marketed towards younger women as far as serums go
i will keep using it since i paid a good amount of money
this must be one of the least effective
i personally can picture this mask being worth about $15 for the hydration i get from it
my personal opinion is that a drugstore item can do just as good
won't be repurchasing this
it did not firm or lift as it states it will
it's also not sephora exclusive as the site states
i would apply is daily
i will not be spending 80 on a mask
not any better than regular organic honey
gives you the same result
in fact the results are very temporary
as the claims state
think i'll keep repurchasing those
appreciate that it is alcohol-
it says it firms
even if it was temporary
you will have an opportunity to see more results
i would have given a three rating
based on a stranger's comment i have to give credit where due
this product is not for all skin types.
the results do not justify a $58 price tag
there are masks that do the same thing for a fraction of the price
this product is clearly not for that skin type
use it every other week or my face gets
had high hopes for this one
as with any product
the only issue i have
something i have to deal with should i continue to use this product
i got this for free from the influenster website
i still use it
other cleansers can do the same thing with lower price
love many of her products
i feel that it needs to be reapplied throughout the day
this product was supposed to work well for acne
wrinkles at the same time should not be an option
i do really like several of the other products in the kit
this was not the case with the "all skin types" bottle
my $3 soap give a same result..
i can see instant results.
i'll advise you to do the same
nothing special for such a high price
this product is not something i can use on daily basis
there are always so many chemicals in their products
am glad to use it as a free gift
all are rated high as toxic on the ewg website.
i found that people were purchasing this more for dark circles
it did help in reducing them
but try before spending the cash.
that might be an issue
there are not too many products that claim this as it has vitamin k
i tried it on only one eye to compare the difference
had high hopes for it
i usually rely heavily on the wealth of reviews on here
i am still wrinkle free at age 45
i definitely won't be repurchasing.
for the price it did not deliver
i do still use the product
i will keep using other products from his line though
i may purchase that in the future.
i do like his other products that i have tried.
i did a lot of research before buying this product
was perfectly willing to spend $100 for a treatment that would help diminish my dark circles
i found it difficult to apply because of the "beads"
a waste of money at any price
i will continue to use it
i tried thus product
that’s far from the actual price
therefore i am still working with it!
given the price tag
besides, unworthy for such price!
i apply every morning
for the the price
consider them before buying this product
is it the packaging or am i getting a bad batch?
i quit using the product immediately
it will exclude a lot of customers.
nothing seems to be helping with this new dryness
i will use up the bottle but will not repurchase.
nothing special about it
specially when you're paying a premium for the br
i will not continue using this product.
i would save my money and buy the mask instead!
please don't waste your money on this product.
i also felt that the pump in the 1oz bottle was very limited to the product it dispensed which was also disappointing
i don't know if mine was defective or what
won't be buying any more of this.
i do still love other products from this line
i love the mask so when i needed more hydration on a daily level
i found it average i most likely won't repurchase because of that
the only reason why i'm giving 2 stars is the scent
it is waste of money
i know others have had success with this
i prefer their black tea age delay product.
don't know its effectiveness
plays well with other products
the weird thing though is that it has added fragrance in the ingredient list
if i don't apply the right products to my skin
fresh like the packaging seems to imply
i know that this product is meant to be all natural
my face this morning was the exact definition of that condition
will not repurchase due to the scent
try a drugstore alternative first.
would do the same job
this is not a l'occitane product i will repurchase
the price is right on this product
also because i love l'occitane products.
i don't think i will repurchase because of the overwhelming scent
it has no benefit to skin
not all plant oils are good.
however the scent should have been a warning sign
not all plant-based oils are good for your skin!
hence, i will not rebuy it.
i heard it would prevent acne as well.
there a lot of other micellar products that do the same thing for a lot less
i would rather go to drug stores
wouldn't want to smell it on a daily basis.
i specifically asked about the tinting component as i didn't want anything that tinted
at the price- or any price
i wish this product came with a pump or squeeze applicator
this is for you
since i like other perricone product
i am new to perricone products.
had hoped that this would provide the same type of coverage
it basically provides no coverage at all.
i will not be purchasing this.
had high hopes for a high end product at this price
would not purchase in the future.
i don't expect results from any product after using only
in the other two products
directly in the trash can!
rub off while i applied the other product
stilldon't see results that make me want to buy for the price
therefore i can't use any algenist products.
don't spend your money on this.
plus suggested use saying its for day/night
the sales associate recommended this cleanser to me for those issues
i find that in this case
there has long been a "debate" if you will on the long term effects of "beads" on the skin
i typically do not return purchases
i rarely return products
meaning not a good shower product-color changes immediately
when you first apply
would be better off if you doubled your water intake for a few days for actual results
which makes it hard to see where you already applied product
it adds no value to my acne problem
i love the ibuki line in general
this product may work for certain people/skin types
i loved the idea that this is not an acne-specific treatment
i think this is because it contains alcohol
since i can smell the alcohol when i apply it
was convinced it was tailored just for me
i wrote this mainly for anyone else looking to use it for redness issues
i do not see a single difference in my skin after using this product
plus i prefer the pump application.
the newer product is more of an actual gold glitter which i don't really care for
3 starts is just appropriate in my opinion.
discover only 2/3 of product filled the bottle
thats's why i order online .
how convenient to be able to pick the properties one wants in a serum
i won't be reordering.
i also like how fine the powder is
it's a complete scam and a waste of packaging.
the seller compare it to a bag of chips
at least they only cost 3$
overall, i would not buy this.
for that amount of product josie should only charge $25
had high hopes for this product being able to relieve my grievances
i wouldn't recommend this for anyone under 35-40- when the age of blemishes are less likely to ever occur
this product should do better for those of that age group
for this amount of money
no improvement in any category.
of course, this just applies to me.
results could be different on you
yes it works as advertised
since the directions say to use morning
this one is the one for you
i also think it is recommended
the price is high
the packaging was fine for me.
there are much better options available
this one is no exception
carries high prices to prove it
its because i used a promo code to get a mini of this for free
if you are interested in a bobbi brown non-primer skin prep/base product
which is actually the only bobbi product i enjoy
no one selects an item
had high hopes for this
love the application and the look.
the long-wear foundation
i've tried so many primers
the "renewed" update of these product's do not even come close to the original
this new formula isn't nearly as good!!
use many of their products
this new formula doesn't hold a c
since that is no longer an option, i tried this.
this is not the same.
with this change i will have to find a new br
please bring back the original.
this is not the same product at all.
if you were a user of hope in a jar dry skin formula you will be very disappointed in this product
it does not hydrate as well as the previous version
this is not as good as the original hope in a jar
is less effective than the original
i still use it
i also needed to start getting consistent with spf
personally for me i try to stay away from such sunscreens
i do appreciate the effort to include spf.
is not a suitable replacement by any means
it is difficult to apply and gets in your eyes.
the price is reasonable
other claims this product says it does
the price point in lower
i would recommend using the money towards another product that works
i needed a new eye cream
this also tends to leave on some type of residue after applying which i hated
i give products most products a fair chance
nothing special about this.
i discontinued use immediately
does not provide the moisture i need.
purchased this with the entire genius line with high hopes that my dark spots
i got this cream with the intent to use it for both day
using it alone is fine
not even that effective
a sephora rep really sold me on the benefits for my post acne marks
for the price, i would definitely not repurchase.
which i've not experienced before this
try to get as many samples as you can before purchasing
because you will pay for the br
not the product in this case
i think there may be a beauty or product addiction in this generation because there are so many products i've tried out that everyone claims is the best
i've had similar results with things that are cheaper
all the hype i expected results
then used it with the good genes
i do still use food genes
which could be a concern
i've tried other face oils without that issue
i still continue using good genes on its own
which i continued to use alone for 3 weeks-ish
based on the cost alone
this should be a miracle product
based on the claims in the description
the company uses this format because it's way cheaper than pure retinol
the fact that this does anything at all is purely due to oils in the formula
there are many of them on the market
had equal if not better results
albeit this is subjective as many find the scent offensive
i would not repurchase.
i personally would not use this daily.
i wanted to try a different face oil.
as i haven't paid attention into measuring that
could you find less costly alternatives absolutely
this product is supposed to firm skin
unfortunately the price point for this product is outrageous
chose what i need for my skin
will keep you posted
the other two are
i try to mix up products to see what works as i'm a fan of new products
could be the kinds i got along with my skin type
for the price other br
unfortunately this does not compare with the effect of the 3 individual serums
i'd pay double or triple the price of this
a+ to this company for trying something different
these products do live up to the hype
i can get literally tons of others that come in the amount advertised
like several other mid-20s users with oily or combination skin have noted
i am still wanting to find a product with retinal that does not break me out
now 85$ less in my my bank account
/or having to vary the days
we are parting ways
i've tried varying the amount i apply
i would recommend this only for a bare
the real issue for me is that each time i apply makeup it balls
i tried it under my foundation as a primer
make sure i was using the correct amount
so it's a total fail as a primer.
regardless of the products i used
regardless of what application i use
s that decide to venture into makeup
their makeup products at least
it was perfect for use under my new foundation which
do not use any oil-based products with this or it will pill
no matter how i apply this product
like the mufe or smashbox one
avoid the real flowers at all cost
if they ever make it fragrance free
another downside is the cost
the cost seems prohibitive
mainly because of the cost
it pills even more if you apply makeup over it.
there is a pump for the product to come out of
there was no tube to allow the product to come up the pump
this happened with four different packages.
i went to different sephora locations
even saw that the label looked different on the new bottles i attempted purchasing
maybe after the packaging is fixed
love murad, but this is a total miss.
the problem is the price.
i usually don't regret purchases
feels immediately after application
i love this particular line from first aid beauty
the description stated that it may help with conditions like seborrhea etc
i won't be repurchasing this product.
i can stay matte for an hour at most with this
i will not be purchasing this product.
it's definitely being exchanged for a new
one positive is that a very small amount of product goes a long way
the search continues for a products that really works
find that within an hour i need to either reapply or blot my skin
will not be repurchasing.
i don't think i would repurchase for mattifying purposes
when you first apply it
since the sephora employee was so complimentary of the product
money i could have spent elsewhere.
same result every time
the only way i can keep oil at bay is with a
buy this one instead
foundation does not apply well on top of the product
this product is way to expensive to perform the way it does
i tried the pore professional by benefit after that
i would rather use a bottom shelf
even without any other makeup
this did not help control oil more than any other oil-controlling primer or powder
there is absolutely no difference in lasting power or shine control with or without this product
the most annoying of this product is the promise of the sephora representative that swears that the product works for 6 months if i used a half of the pump every time
push me to buy something with lies
as the "tightness" from this product it's probably due to the alcohol content which is appalling since why would you want to add a drying ingredient in an eye product that is promoted to help anti aging?
not the actual product
even applied it only on one undereye to compare.
also the associate did not mention that the instructions suggest applying the essence
said how amazing it is for my specific issue
when a product doesn't bring value to the customers
that product should be discontinue
using two other products with this same line
i see no difference after using this product.
my no means am i saying that it is wallet friendly either
i find it worth the money to do what it claims i am 23 with dry skin an am not using or in a place where i can afford anti aging products
as i don't think it contains quality ingredients
it's just a regular moisturizer which you can get a similar one from drug store within 10 bucks
it may have been the combo
i like the consistency of the product.
i recommend you do the same if you're interested in this product
guess i'll keep searching for a new wash
i'll not repurchase it, though.
i will not be repurchasing.
i will not repurchase any belif products
i love some other belif products
not being able to use it on my eyes is a drawback
in the how to use section
it also doesn't have many anti-aging benefits
am tired of repurchasing it every other month
however my skin can
this product seemed like any other basic moistrizer
will not be repurchasing.
the amount of product you get is a good value
i'll start with the positives: you get s lot of product for the price
my dermotologist told me to stop using it because this formula is not good for anyone due to one of its main ingredient being denature alcohol which is bad for your skin
find new products to use
this has come in most of theit packages
to be exact) is outrageous.
i frequently get more product from the various deluxe samples in my play
i feel like there are similar products which are just as effective
especially if they cost less than my current cream
i will use this up but won't repurchase.
this time i did looked at the ingredient list
realize there is alcohol in it
i am changing to a different moisturizer now.
get a cream from a different br
wanted a little preventive care.
this is no different than a drug store eye cream.
on the other h
that is about it
no results at all
as others have stated
you can buy gallons at the comparable price of this ineffective product
thought i would give it a go for hydration purposes
prefer the ginzing one over this
redeemed this 100-point perk at sephora to test out other eye creams
it does not address that issue
true first aid beauty
it does make my skin appear brighter directly following application
my hunt for the life changing
this may be good for those with no true under eye issues
for the price tag i would look elsewhere
now its in a pump.
i expect more at this price point
though on the other h
one can find cheaper alternatives everywhere else
i will not be repurchasing it.
though to add to the collection
may also break your skin out
this should be marketed as glitter.
oil free which i like
it is light weight but not for me.
it was nothing special
or even what ingredients are in it
there is nothing on the packaging
im mainly annoyed that there is no ingedients list anywhere
i only apply it under my eyes for extra boost.
i mix it with a cream for better application
i also tried it on wet skin in case that would help with the sensitivity
unfortunately the outcome was the same
i would only repurchase if glamglow fixed packaging
had high hopes for this
the gel by itself is nothing at all special
being able to customize how much of the mud
oil you can use
i would invest that money into other products that you could more value from
still not seeing any benefits
i love all my other glamglow products
s products except this one
i love all the regular products in cling the green just not as this dual bottle cleanser
glamglow needs to do some revamping on this one.
doea not perform well under makeup
primers do not work on top at all
if you apply essence
i like this product because it has high spf
i say this as a fair skinned person
no primer or other product on my face
it will be a waste of money
the fact that it has spf in it
i would day i'm normal
i love the rest of their products
may be it will be better if i use it on top of a serum however i dont like to pile products
on the other h
i might have been willing to overlook that if this sunscreen had more staying power
certainly not suitable for any kind of
not a look you can take out in public!
i wouldn't want to use this on a daily basis as my regular spf
i usually love first aid beauty items
i would use this for working outside or beach
it is definitely a go to for the beach or outdoor activities where i will be in the sun all day
no matter what foundation i choose to wear over this
i love every other product from the first aid beauty br
i won't be repurchasing it.
that it doesn't lift/firm
received two free samples of this mask glad i didnt spend money on this as i will not be purchasing
save your money for a better alternative.
was hoping this could be an inexpensive add to my collecting
it created no difference on the long term for my skin
it's affordable, but i'm returning it.
i would recommend that 100%
that’s when i came across these affordable little gel pods by sephora
i will not repurchase
i like to use one for both.
purchased this because it was recommended by one of the staff members at sephora based on the description i'd given them for what i was in need of
will not be re-purchasing.
very poor design, will not purchase again.
which i struggle with
the packaging should be changed
i continued to try the product
definitely unlike any other mask i've used
it does provide what i would consider a significant amount of moisture
perhaps it will work for others
doesn't make any immediate difference besides being reasonably hydrating
i would not repurchase
i will continue to use
those are where you pores are.
for the price i was excepting a bit more
this mask is nothing special.
i don't plan on using this any longer.
i recently purchased this in hopes of finding a mask that would help with my occasional breakouts
there are other products out there that are more effective for the money you are spending
i like other caudalie products
according to an option in the instructions
i would recommend another brand.
can only assume it was relating to using this product
may try a different charcoal mask from another br
may have been good to use with multi-masking
t may have been one of the plant oils
i applied this product
for a while after application if your skin is like mine
10 out 10 would not recommend testing this out
i will continue to use it
my skin is pretty strange so use your own discretion about using it on your own
it does have a scent that you need to get used to as well
i'll call a sephora store to see if they can offer me some insight for this product??
only added this as "something new"
could see the true results
it was a one time use deal.
i found this to be nothing special at all
i really thought this was on par with any drugstore quality product
not only does it have an overwhelming scent of alcohol
it lists actual perfume as an ingredient
so be frugal with it
however, my initial thoughts remain true.
beware those with combination skin.
overall body care so that must be why
again this could be because most of the products i use are all natural
either i've found military-grade makeup that doesn't budge
who wants to add a seperately eye make up remove
those are my cons
there is plenty of product for the price
cleansing ability was about the same
as of today i'm experiencing same issue
this product is nearly impossible to dispense
would not recommend buying it.
there is no way i can apply makeup after using this product
not my go to for anti aging benefits
both those reasons combined with the fact that it made no difference to my under eye area is why i would not recommend this product
it seems to at least apply well
i love other products by boscia
i tested this product in a small area on my face to test how it would work with my skin
my first use was to apply directly to multiple areas of my face
rub it in than expected from a cleanser in what i assume is supposed to be an "easy to use package"
had to apply pressure to get product on to m face
deally the concept of having a stick form cleanser for travel purposes is great
overall not what i expected
if you follow the instructions
i would say buy it cause it seems to give you a fresh new layer of face
i know for sure it was this product causing my enlarged pores as it was the only new product i was using
the cons outweigh the pros in my opinion
i'd did not reduce oil or increase it
i usually use boscia products
overall not sure if i would repurchase this
i'll definitely be repurchasing that
still... not the same result.
the instructions in the product does give you massage methods for the face
plus i don't think this provides enough as s solo product
i made the mistake of using this as an all day moisturizer
in case you are interested
i am not a fan of the honey feel or the potential bee distress
title disclaimer: i did not purchase the $98 bottle
nor are the ingredients
seems like the cost
its really not that effective.
such as the pre-emt collection
your call to get it!
i did without new hair product
i owe that to healthy habits
products like this one
and what is with the price of this brand?!!
trying to do damage control.
the results are not significant enough to merit using it regularly in your beauty routine
this is the kind of product you would need to use regularly
i say if you have unlimited money to spend on beauty products you will likely enjoy this item
the price is not worth it to me to just have soft skin when i have used other masks for half the cost that gave me soft skin
will not be repurchasing.
i do see minimal results from a few of their other products
i love all the other masks
considering the price tag i expected more
i won't purchase it
i am sure there are other less expensive options in the market which would perform the same way
works the same as less expensive br
if the price was reasonable
mainly from 4 different companies
now the glamglow products have taken the top spot
i like that its its cheaper than the original
i can use daily
none of these products work for what their price is
comparable to drug store brands.
am guessing i have a sensitivity to the ingredients
i did follow the directions
i definitely won't be purchasing this product
why spend money on a temporary fix that does nothing?
don't have to use two products
wish this was a better value.
undecided if i'll be repurchasing.
used it on top of everything else
the problem is that when you click in the 'ingredients' tab
bad product please remove this from industry
can only speak to the short term results:
this sounded like a serious combination product that checked all the boxes
might still try other masks
next time will be more cautious before purchasing
it says the product is not tested on animals
which is why a lot of people are upset right now that some big companies that claim to be cruelty-free have branched out to china
i wanted to speed along the process
on the other h
will be sticking with them
one just needs to find the kind that works particular skin
though i didn't see the formation of any new brake outs
it didn't improve my current ones at all
like that you can get a couple uses from one pod
package is also bad since using a fine layer doesn't use up all the product in the package
i would repurchase in the future
if i apply this in the morning
makeup user for many years
for the price i expected more from this product
i would rate this one as average
super excited to try this cleansing oil since it stated it would remove all types of make-up
which would show the makeup
the only way to fully remove this oil is by using a wipe of some sort
the sales rep at sephora recommended this one because it was significantly cheaper than some of the other br
especially if i was wearing contacts at the time of use
i would not repurchase this.
i would not purchase at this price.
that's about the only plus i found
almost all are five star ratings using the similar promising lines
i cannot wrap my head around these pop up companies charging higher than premium prices for a tiny amount of mediocre products
most of the "active" ingredients fall in the lower third of the list
ingredients are listed in decreasing quantity
you can get double the amount of a truly professional masque with 15 times the amount of active ingredients for much less money
the result is similar to that which can be achieved with any good mask
so do so many other products at a lower price point
according to the package directions
i don't think the strong perfumes are necessary
there is not a single change in my skin
i received the clinique smart line as a gift.
save up and spend your money on a better product.
i shouldn't have expected much since it is an inexpensive moisturizer
the ingredients are cheap and outdated.
tria replaced it with no problems since it was still under warranty
the eye laser is not for me.
i should have a reasonable expectation
i exchanged the laser for a new one with no hassle
i would also like to add that i have tried a lot of products
charged it as per the instruction booklet
meaning it was effective
when i apply it
at least sephora has a great exchange policy!
i think the purpose of these drops are for just that
it works with all my skin care products
don't see any long lasting results
it did what it said on the label
for some reason i usually have issues with ptr products
i will not repurchase.
it contained all the ingredients i wanted
being such a fan of that
do yourself a favor and save your money.
this eye cream is a waste of time and money.
false description use listed here.
the only use listed on the container itself says 'sunscreen'
i am planning on using the whole thing since it was expensive
because they will feel gross
wish that it was a regular moisturizer
thought that this product was simply average
total waste of $$$ and product.... why boscia?!?!
ingredients are on point
this product was recommended to me as such
i love 99 percent of boscia's products.
its doing work on your face
i do use it with other products
i would not recommend using this creme
save your buck for some more worthy eye creams
the product does work well
for the price i expect a better performing cream than this
however must be daytime for non make up wearing ladies
i gave this three stars because it's an effective product
i would say average product.
on to another product for me!
love many other products from this br
i ordered this in a neverending quest to find something to replace the $250 lam*** eye cream i've been using for 20+ years
have not seen any anit-aging benefits at all
"fine" is the only word i can use to describe this
it is easy to apply
a more affordable at day
just an average product.
still no results at all
due to the $108 dollar price tag
that doesn't't justify the high price tag
honestly compares to any generic face cream you could pick up much cheaper at the drug store
this was not effective for me
what the sephora description does not tell you is that the box as well as the l'occitane website specifies it as being for normal to dry skin
i think i will try new first aid rich moisturizer
i wouldn't recommend it for the price.
needed to get to free shipping
customer service was nice enough to email me their return policy in response to my inquiry
since it was over 90 days, i was not eligible.
waste of money due to poor packaging.
may feel different for other people.
thought these were a reasonable price
this one contains more alcohol
with that said i expected more from such a prestigious skin care line
i can put almost any product on my skin
i wish i paid closer attention to the ingredients
there is a lot of alcohol in this
will i be repurchasing?
the problem with this product was the actual engineering of the package
for $90, i expect to see some results.
a serum of a lower price would do the same job!
with this i failed to see any additional benefits
hence for the price tag i will not be repurchasing
this may work for someone that hasn't been using high end- quality products or niacinamide in general
cannot justify the price
the product is fine.
for the price, i expected more.
i just ordered the combo package with the new power moisturizer
this product deserves five stars.
given the price of this product
there are other products just as effective at the same price point where attention is paid to packaging that assures easy application
this product is amazing like most other algenist products
the same issue applies to every bottle
for over one hundred dollars that is just not acceptable
if they come out with a new dispenser
i see the same complaint everywhere for this product
this formula is no exception
i can already see improvements in my fine lines
it will be tough to evaluate the benefits of this product as i don't anticipate being able to get much more of it out of the bottle
as many others have found
saw no benefit of using them for the money i paid
thinking that i would notice the "film" less under my liquid foundation
two stars because you get a lot of product for the price
i needed a new eye cream
i'll finish it because i refuse to waste product.
but i won't repurchase
not special enough for the price
i do not see any major improvements to my eye area after using this product either
it smells the same as other kenzoki productsi feel like the product is overpriced
does not improve my redness- which is intended purpose for this product
think that was likely due to a different product
this product does not layer well with other skin products
it is supposed to be all natural
i only used this product one day on a recommendation for redness reduction
with a $46 price point i would hope for all natural
likely won't repurchase it
however, i wouldn't purchase it though.
if you don't have a special need for this product
i don't see an improvement.
some days i think this product is helping.
it has high amount of alcohol.
will not be repurchasing.
which led to needing to use more of the $125 moisturizer than should have been necessary
why all their products don't have the whole list of ingredients?
this is not something i will be repurchasing or recommending
find there are better creams at same price point
with the price point
it is noooothing special at all
for the price i'll not re-purchase
will continue to use for acne until i find a similar cheaper alternative
sephora for this kind of dishonesty
i expected this cream to perform better than creams half the price
as i don't feel the results justify the cost
there seems to be a flaw in the bottle design
manufacture for this product
lancer need to address the packaging issue
assuming that sephora only sold quality eye treatments
it would not dispense
again, the bottle would not dispense the product.
not only would it not dispense
would neither separate nor budge at all
ordered this online and the pump did not work.
for the $95 price tag, this is embarrassing.
mpressed with its longer term results
i explained to her that i have been using oil free products all of my life
the amount of oil that would build up on my face was gross
it was a poor recommendation for me, but thanks
even if i'm out being active
my issue is the hydration, or lack of in my case.
i think it would be ideal for those with normal to combination skin
for the price i was expecting more product
i won't be repurchasing this one!
use your regular cleanser and save your money.
been trying to find the perfect cleanser to go with the device
not what i originally experienced with this particular one
what this product intends to do
would not re-purchase or recommend.
won't be using this any more
animal cruelty-free approach
i will continue to support this company
please, make a better product.
i would warn others not to purchase
was personally in the market for a new moisturizer
don't have to deal with it under makeup
overall i wouldn't recommend buying this.
i received this as a point perk.
i used it for about a week to give it a fair chance
like other people have said
as many others have mentioned it balls up
however like many other people have said
i tried applying different ways
per the instructions given in the listing
the one required star is for the smell
like all of the other clients said
as many other people have said
not many products have this effect on me
even though it is called rise
including my primer which i use every day with no problem
i felt it difficult to apply makeup on top of it
i apply primer on top
this product might work for some people
usually that only happens with certain primers
i might still try some of farmacy's other products to see if they have potential
other than that it may not be the best product for a daily moisturizer
i wouldn't repurchase or recommend this product
i will not re-order as this cost me close to $100 with tax
it is easy to apply makeup over it
i swear by lancome's advanced genifique
i brought this with me overseas for the military because i wanted to travel with as few liquids as possible
the soap being responsible for this is unclear to me
plus on line it doesn't say it has rose extract
for a while i'd been wanting to buy from herbivore
both immediately after application
i loved every single claim in this product
it would have been so effective
such as this product
two stars for packaging and company ideals!
i will not be repurchasing this oil.
some higher cost options
this would be a good face oil if you are looking only for mild hydration
not nearly as strong
i won't be re purchasing this
i do want to leave my two cents
my skin looks about the same
that one changes the game
my other main issue with this item is the size.
i found that in order for this product to really be effective
despite resenting the fact that it was conveniently out of stock during the sale
i rated this "fair" because it's an average product
there may be something "pineapple" happening in the ingredients
indulge in something with more substantial results
i applied as per the directions
i got this mask because of the ongoing hype of both it
truthfully it was such a complete waste
made sure i was using it the correct amount of times– i was
i agree with others
or it being combined with
for the price tag
i even have afeeling maybe some of these reviews are fake like they do with new br
i still did not find this to be an effective treatment
i won't be repurchasing
overall, not something i would repurchase.
for the price i was expecting to see some results other than just moisturization
don't have the same additional concerns i do
k thought this would work
either give us more product or cut down on packaging
if this same formula was made as a face cream that would be more suiting
this product might be effect on preventing these problems
reading other reviews i had high hopes this was more effective than others on the market to improve texture around the eyes
specifically with this product the shape makes it challenging to get the last of the product out as it clings to the side
i also will reiterate the hatred i have for the dispenser that others have noted
you can use one of those
i should be able to control how much serum comes out
its seems to be an ok product.
i will not repurchase
which is a bummer because this serum was more on the expensive side than comparable br
y dropper measures precisely what you need every time
it's foolproof - i wish more products had it.
i will be using solely as a night cream
when i use this product
it tends to pill up over any other item i use under it
i continued to apply it to my face thinking
cruelty free products before
i will not repurchase it
i still have all of the same bumps
i know i have to give products a change to work
i tried the rest of the de line via "the littles"
like the other viewers said
i will return this product.
wagon before doing my own research
substituting it for something else to see which product was causing this
i will swear by every other product they have
however it is a al
as i love their other products
it would be most beneficial if drunk elephant would include this information with their package insert
after saving up (de products are expensive!!)
the only reason i was willing the spend the money on it in the first place was because it came in an opaque package with a pump to reduce the rate of oxidation
i find they helps
well, it's a mask which is different from others.
two stars because it didn't have any adverse effects such as breaking me out
combo skin on its own
this is a novelty item.
waited for it to be available in canada due to the brutal exchange rate
here's a prime example of an expensive product i gave a genuine try
with 6 ingredients of dimethcone, no thanks.
if you want something efficient don't get this
replacing my other moisturizers with this one alone
it really contains a lot of product in one unit
you just want to experiment with the k beauty trends coming through sephora nowadays
i think it's better to try out the other cleansers available at sephora
it should be advertised as a shaving cream because that is what it is like
the smell is not offensive
this is more of a unique product than a must have
would not be buying or recommending to anyone
maybe the creators of this product should reconsider wording their description different
this product will be good for teens
the price seemed reasonable
will not be repurchasing.
i like to leave it on for a minute or so to see if any active ingredients can make a difference
steer clear don't buy into the hype
they are just mouse.......
i don't see any other benefits
i'll be trying some of this br
the only problem i have encountered with both of my bottles is that the pump is faulty
for that reason i am giving this a 3 star because i feel that for such a pricey product the packaging needs to be fixed
the original product is still available overseas.
i wish there were more regulation in the cosmetic industry
or other specific eye area problems or concerns
won't repurchase just because i can spend less on an eye cream with the state my skin is in
will finish the tube but possible not repurchase.
there is no difference after i use it
the person that helped me at sephora recommended this one to help with my concerns over fine lines
i will continue to use it, but i wint repurchase.
another partially used skin care product goes into my reject bin
i need to justify the $
i see no results
neither have been true.
i do wish it came in various sizes
used whole bottle with no change in age spots.
all the content in the bottle is gone
waste of money so change or improvement in 5 weeks
don't buy this product.
no change at all.
different products work for different people
i hope this helps!
i may try the post acne product
i feel like this product is such a disappointment that i had to share my frustration online
i got this product direct from murad website
that i would have to pay for shipping for a product that made my problem worse
they definitely don't make you pay for shipping a product that made your problem worse
i normally don't expect immediate results
still searching for a holy grail product.
i made sure that i used adequate amount of sunblock
not the other tones
won't repurchase this one
trying out all kinds of expensive skin care if it works
it makes me question whether i should invest this much money in any other skin care products when there are much cheaper options at drug stores
i don't break out very easily with new products either
i feel the need to warn people that this product destroyed my skin
why am i wasting my time using this serum with a questionable
my dark spots are still the exact same
i would recommend all murad products
the reviews about it not effective are true.
which is why i'm giving it 3 stars.
maybe this works for other skin conditions
or at least not mine
always use it for the minimun required time to see results
i assumed it would be a spot treatment however when i read the instructions after receiving it
it tells you to apply over entire face
which is a shame because i thought i found beauty products that include all people
such as others in the past
one of the girls at sephora recommended this product based on my needs
we are all trying to find the perfect acne solution
even though this particular cleanser didn't work for my needs because having combo skin products vary depending on the persons preference
the only down-site to that is the price.
i can get similar results using cheaper products.
a ton of makeup can be seen
it gets the makeup off fair
which defeats the whole purpose of water free
or just in general
my only complaint is the packaging.
i don't recommend this product at all
the description isn't lying when it says that this is a maximum strength product so be careful
still have some uses
decided to splurge on this in hopes it would work based on the good reviews
prefer the other version
i will continue to use it
but it had no benefits.
while i can see it working for those with oilier skin types
any recommendations for a product like this that works
if i try to apply any kind of makeup over the product
requiring me to wash again with a different product
this would rank towards the bottom
unspecified on the ingredients list
i will be discontinuing its use immediately.
i would remove my makeup with another product
given how expensive this product is
i wouldn't buy this this regularly
there are other balms that are cheaper that i find enjoyable to use
and, i did not see any useful results.
as above comment said
what you paid is for the slick packaging
don't spend your money.
i don't like to use this under foundation at all.
i would prefer physical sunscreens that last longer
wouldn't purchase due to price.
t would not be able to use this without using another product to prime my skin
i see no fixes after everyday usage of this product
don't buy this if you can relate to my situation
will not be repurchasing.
especially knowing the price i paid for it
love the product wish the packaging was better would like pump not brush on the end
the product was just average.
so while you are trying to dispense product
you have to press hard
it's the same as the other
nothing special given the price.
once again sephora has not included the full list of ingredients
there are about 20 ingredients in this oil which al
i rate this 6/10 for 'melting makeup'.
hope someone buys it for you xd
not one single product
if you want to choose a luxurious treat for your face then splurge on this
