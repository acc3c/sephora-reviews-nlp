hence minus one star
like i've been on vacay
i love the smell
that's all i need
i am hooked and this is all i need.
this is the product that started my love affair with sunday riley
i did notice that ceo helped to balance out my skintone
it pairs amazingly well with the sunday riley good genes
i went in to get the drunk elephant vitamin c that i usually use
i dont use it during summer
i am floored with sunday riley products.
i can't use any sunday riley serum because they break me out
that nite i just slapped on my nite moisturizer
i love this stuff.
at nite i put it on after i wash my face
awhile later use my regular nite
well done sunday riley!
i cant love this product more
oh, yes -- and it smells delicious, too!
i love sunday riley products so was eager to try this one
ceo is at the top of my list other than la mer soft cream
my skin loves it
the sunday riley line has only been beneficial
could exchange the "meh" bottle for this one
only sunday riley products make me want to write reviews
i highly recommend the sunday riley line of products
omg my face felt amazing
just felt soo good
i love this product.
ed with my skin care
omg i fell in love
thank you sunday riley!!!
i tend to stick to sunday riley products just because they work on my hormonal skin
the drunk elephant vitamin c that everyone raves about completely broke me out
i decide to give this product a shot because sunday riley rarely lets me down
i really love coconut oil
already use luna, ufo and martian.
another great skin care product from sunday riley
i love so many of the sunday riley products as they've completely changed my acne prone skin into the clear complexion i once knew
all in all, i think this is a hit for sunday.
sunday riley has yet to disappoint!
kat von d foundation
sunday riley is quickly becoming the only br
my skin loves it !
very appt with the results
i spend alot on luxury skin care
personally i love the scent
this is my first time sampling a sunday riley product

i love good vita c products
use the luna oil/good genes combo 3days on 3days off
i love this cream.

sunday riley has never disappointed
good genes/luna in the evenings
which i'm assuming is the vit c working
it's a miracle for me.

then i tried la mer
it's amazing for the cold canadian winter
before la mer my skin looked thirsty
so i decided to mix it with my sunday riley oils.
la mer crème de la mer is what is keeping it that way
how i love it.
we used to call this "crime" de la mer due to price
wow wow wow la mer will let me go down fighting something fierce
ed to my skin's look today
i stopped using it because when i hit 31ish
all hail la mer.
nothing has worked like la mer
i used it years ago when living in santa cruz
the last boston winter
i even just used it in the hot carribean with a thous
when i was on accutane this
i can not live without la mer
at night i put 3 drops of sunday riley's luna oil
of la mer creme de la mer warmed up between my fingers
i disliked the luna oil
n love with this stuff
i love this stuff.
my skin loves it
to release the miracle broth that la mer is known for
then i decided to try crème de la mer after reading some reviews that it healed redness
la mer melts into my skin
i love this product
i got it in the ceo set
i never used another creams after i discovered la mer
i put this on my christmas list
f you average the price
u need this in ur life!
i love this stuff!!
i am obsessed with skin care.
korean -- you get the picture
i come back to the coveted crème de la mer
i only use two la mer products
i used this for years when i lived in dallas
is this the same formulation as in johnson
a johnson stuff we all slather on our baby's bums?
everyone must try creme de la mer at least once in their lifetimes
check on the la mer website how to apply it.
i always go back to using la mer.
you can't help loving
i've used la mer on
i enjoyed the products in my 20s
i used that combo last night after sunday riley's good genes
le to creme de la mer
this moisturizer trumps any other br
nothing compares to la mer
la mer is my top choice.
always go back to la mer because it's the best.
lamer saves my life every time.
before i decided to purchase la mer soft cream
i went to do my facial last sunday
i love this cream
there's a reason people consider this a holy grail

she hates it, i love it.
the la mer rep told me to take a little pea size
thank you la mer!
ive tried to stray because i use this twice a day morning
i truly love it and can't get away from la mer.
purchased chanel le lift
just repurchased the la mer eye concentrate again
the chanel version is garbage
das expensive as kl would say.
just like all the other la mer products
the regular la mer cream
followed by creme de la mer cream
it works well with la mer cream
especially in the t zone
i just pour some into my h
i love how lightweight it is

i finally decided to try the lala retro cream before the spring sale
the only product this cleanser had a hard time taking off was my kat von d tattoo liner
has a lot of hardcore fangirls that really hyped this
products) up and it's just sort of meh.
it only removes the leftover makeup from when u removed ur makeup
when u twist the lid closed
if u leave it at that then it will leak
u have to hear the pop and then twist it more.
just as they did with lala
this feels like a cop out
thank you drunk elephant
the design isn't genius
does that make sense lol
i do admit it does sting the @$
another de product for me to love
beste has done the trick
all of which i love
eyes w/ the beste jelly
beste jelly for pm
i am a huge de fan.
have been using all their products for 1 yr
i love that this is fragrance free
noticed i need to work it with my h

il suffit d'attendre 20-30 minutes après l'application et le gonflement s'estompe
ce produit appaise les yeux gonflés et il hydrate vraiment bien
il pénètre très bien la peau.

easily accessible in canada than liz earle
i honestly love it
enlever son maquillage avec ce nettoyant est si facile
je suis du genre à mettre 15 couches de mascara
et ce produit l'enlève comme si j'en avais pas -_-
car je le prends seulement à titre de démaquillant
et en plus il ren ne teste pas sur les animaux ❤️
use it every other nite.
s or with my clarisonic
your skin feels soo soft afterwards
no ren product has let me down!
i think i like the liz earle cleanser better
i love using the cloth.
i love this product
meh i use one everyday so this is just a tiny version of a regular one
i love the cloth that comes with it
i adore the #1 purity cleansing balm so thought i'd give this a try
nothing from ren disappoints
3 oz bottle of the other br
i used the ren ultra moisterizer
very similar to infamous liz earle which is not available here
thank you ren for deciding to give this to sephora
ma peau adore les produits ren!
j'utilise normalement la gamme hydra-calm puisque j'ai la peau très sensible et beaucoup de rougeurs
ce n'est pas évident de trouver un nettoyant qui va exfolier ma peau en douceur
nettoyer et resserrer mes pores sans créer davantage de rougeurs
l'odeur de roses est très agréable et identique à celle du baume démaquillant de la même gamme
ce nettoyant quotidien complémente très bien mon exfoliant f10
que j'utilise 2 fois par semaine
je suis très heureuse de mon achat!
i am not a fan of peter thomas roth lines.

ayant essayé divers produits qui ne m'ont pas du tout impressionnée dans le passé
j'ai été agréablement surprise par la sensation de fraicheur et de lift suite à l'application du gel
dès le lendemain de la première application
le contour de mes yeux était frais et reposé
les poches étaient dégonflées et l'apparence des cernes foncés avait considérablement diminuée
les signes de fatigue étaient bel et bien une histoire ancienne
petit produit miracle pour celles qui
ont naturellement tendance à avoir des poches disgracieuses sous les yeux malgré plusieurs heures de sommeil
this is my hg product.
i love the consistency 100%.
i wanted to de-puff my eye area a bit
everyone is raving about the pumpkin-y smell

j'utilise cette crème contour des yeux depuis une semaine
l'intensité de mes cernes à diminué de façon spectaculaire
avant, ils étaient bruns très foncés.
maintenant, ils sont beaucoup plus pâles.
mes ridules s'estompent doucement et mon contour des yeux a toute l'hydratation voulu
le meilleur produit du monde
pour la quantité de crème en vaut tout de même le coût
f that improves then i'll change my review to 5 stars
i am a lancer devotee

the phoenix oil is way better
ps i also noticed that my cuticles are amazing ever since using this
as i use the sunday riley luna at night
this is holy grail status for me
j'ai vu ce produit sur le site de gwyneth paltrow
je voulais essayer une huile pour le visage alors j'ai tenté le coup
quelle belle découverte et quel produit parfait pour les aimants du naturel
ma peau est plus belle et a l'air plus en santé.
ce n'est pas trop gras à l'application et est absorbé rapidement
je l'utilise avec le masque brighten de la même compagnie
i prefer it over tarte, argan, origins ect.
use it everyday, my favorite for face godliness.
honestly none of them have compared to the phoenix oil from herbivore
since i started using phoenix
i can't wait to try the orchid
i like this product.
people have seen a difference in my skin since ive been using this
it was a god-send when i was on accutane
i love the consistency of the oil
depuis que j'utilise ce masque
ma peau est moins sujette aux imperfections
elle parait plus en santé et moins fatiguée.
je l'utilise avant l'huile pour le visage phoenix de la même marque que j'adore aussi
i should've googled it
i wanted to love this oil
had the phoenix oil for awhile which i also love.
i love both of them
love all the herbivore stuff
i apply dr jart's ceramidin day tint on top
herbivore is the br
i love using it everyday
