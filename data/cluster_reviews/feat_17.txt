at night after cleansing your face
plump in the morning
i used this cream both day and night.
i found it to be better for night time usage than daytime
it needed powder over it during the day to control shine
it's too heavy for daytime in the warmer summer weather
by the time i wake its fully absorbed
this cream for night time use
i don't use it during the day since i use a spf combo lotion during the day
this is great for night time use
evening for a month now
i only use it is the morning before applying my make-up
washing my face in the evening
washing my face in the evening
i've kept mine in the fridge to help depuff during my am skin routine
i added it to my night time routine.
heavy when i tried to use it during the day
then i made the connection that i stopped using these every morning
i left them on for 10 minutes
i instantly look like i slept 3 extra hours :)
i put this on every morning while i do my eye makeup
well worth dedicating 10 relaxing minutes to
i put them on in the morning once a week
you're suppose to leave on for ten minutes
as a "sleeping mask" at bedtime
like to use them after a night on the town
i apply these before bed
leave it on for an hour or so
i usually use these at night
nice to use before a night out or in
just got this yesterday
i left it overnight
i leave it on for a total of 20 minutes in the morning before i apply my makeup
i leave it on for 10 minutes under my eyes
i used them right before bed
go about your day
after 2 weeks of not sleeping more than 5hrs a night
check it out at @yaasssssmine on instagram.
the best part is that when i woke up
i go from not woke to that kerr glow in 15 minutes flat
i would use it twice a day around my eyes
i applied it every morning
didn't crease as much as it usually did throughout the day
i started to use it morning
it's really light weight for morning use
i decided to start using it as my daytime eye gel
wait 5 minutes before starting my eye makeup
felt slightly cooling in the mornings
i put on this eye gel in the morning
more likely from the lack of sleep during the busy work week
i apply it to my under eyes before applying primer in the morning
next on my list is the night balm!
in about 5-10 minutes they look lighter
especially first thing in the morning
this gel cream literally wakes me up every morning once i apply it to area around my eyes
i usually put it on right after i shower
from my summer vacation to the beach my face was also dehydrated
i put this on at night
tried it on the other night before going to bed
i tried this mask for the first time today
i am hooked after first use!
this is my go to when i have early mornings.
well, i used it last night, and oh.
5 minutes into the 10 minutes that you leave this stuff on
when i woke up early morning
evens it out at the same time
i sat on the couch feeling more relaxed than i had all week
ill be keeping this in my bathroom at all times.
love to use this in the morning time on pool/beach days or other times when i plan on wearing less makeup
being in my late 40's
normally with masks i will wake up the next morning with a rash
i love using this mask after a long work week of constantly wearing makeup from morning to night
i feel so refreshed once i take it off
i do apply it twice today once in the morning
once before i go to bed
night cream at night
my face is really starting to brighten up after about 3 weeks
place a small amount on my face before i go to bed
i put them on after washing my face in the evening
when i woke up the next morning i was pretty amazed by the effects
after 2 weeks of puting it religiously morning
night on that spot
am i the only one who use it at night?i loooove to use it at night after my essence
before my night cream
radiant face the next morning
this is heaven to use each night
ready for its morning routine
stay all day foundation
just bought it 11/1 i expect this to last through at least january
eve what usual would show up on the towel i use to dry my face
treat with good genes by sunday riley before using this as my final step
it is more like a night moiturizer.
when i wake up in the morning
smooth the next day
put it on one night
next morning my face was as soft as it has ever been
feels great the following morning
i put it on after i wash
noticed a difference in my skin when i woke up the next morning
apply this before bed
i put this over my night moisterizer.
i used this during august
september while the weather was still pretty warm on the east coast
i usually put it on in the evening after i wash my face before i go to bed
wore this one night after being outside in the cold for a few hours
after my nightly routine put on a generous layer
i will definitely use this nightly
i used both before bed last night
this overnight cream makes my face feel so soft in the morning
my face was glowing the next morning
t won't flake or dry mid day/night
since i don't wear much make up in the summer
perfect for the summer!
i've also used it alone at night
flaky later on in the day
i usually put this on after my moisturiser followed by my makeup
when i'm off to school in a rush i just use this alone
wash my face every night
on days when i don't wear foundation
i get compliments on my skin daily
i also use it before bed i have noticed my skin looks rejuvenated after using now for about a month my crows feet are not as bad as before
i've also used it as a night mask
about once a week i just put it all over my face like a moisturizer after my shower
i get super dark in the summer
like the kind you get when you spend that first summer day out in the sun
i am sure the lift
i wore this alone as my foundation the other day
i used it at night
it is the first step in my morning routine to prep my skin for the rest of my skincare
at this time i'd say this is my favorite eye cream
especially in the morning
it was beginning to show
at night i pair it with a st
enough so that i use it at night
at night before bed after washing my face
no oil through out the day
it was my first day using it.
and the next day my dry areas were not dry!
i put it on right after i shower or go to bed
u may put it on during anytime of the day
the next morning i wake up
i used it once a day
either at night or in the morning in combination with my sunscreen
i put this on morning after washing my face
i mainly used it at night
i put this on before bed
wake up the next day with super soft
summer months when my skin was dry from sun exposure
every time i wear it at night
use it at night as well.
i used this last night
in the morning i put it on
i used it the other night
saw the firmness it provided the next day
as of now my routine for mornings i wash my face
am on my second bottle
i stocked up on this during the holiday sales
is my new daytime routine
i would wake up in the morning
after i started using this product i wake up
usually i am really shiny by the afternoon
with this product my makeup seems to last longer with less shine by the afternoon
the night serum at night
when they dry i use this followed by a moisturising cream
t framboos for night to the next level
in winters i used this only in morning.
i now see virtually zero oil even after a 9 hour work day
(i’m on the 2nd bottle at the moment.)
the like at night
i didn't fall in love with this overnight.
so now i am back to using the bars
this will always have a place in my bathroom!
i put this on during the 'serum' step in my routine
i apply this miracle of a product twice a day
in the morning after letting c-firma settle in for a few minutes
at night i either apply it after tlc framboos on its own
too rich for my skin if used 7 nights a week
i've used it every day sometimes 2x a day
lala during the day
tonight is my first time using this product
then a few minutes later i put moisturizer on top of it
i would keep a bottle in every room of the house
use it on every part of my body
after following de on instagram
i am never oily as the day goes on
even next morning skin
this would probably work best in spring/summer for people with dry skin
i am waiting for my seaberry oil to run out
throughout the day i get more
in the morning i use it by itself
i will use this of the day
i did purchase a heavier cream for the night
especially in the winter
this product is so mosturizing you can use it in the morning or before bed
or if you like during the day
during my last sephora trip i notice it's changed
fresh after i apply it
hours later i will be sitting somewhere
rejuvenation in the morning
i leave mine on close to 10 minutes
i reserve it for those mornings when i've slept in my makeup the night before
had to use it that same night
hop in the shower
then one night i put it on
now i leave it on for 10-15 minutes
fresh which is nice for the morning
literally the next day i will wake up with amazing smooth skin
i used this frequently when i needed to look awake after missing a couple hours of sleep
then one night before i had a final i crammed the night before
got no sleep at all
look like i had a full 8 hours
after about 3-4 weeks of using a little of the eye cream each night i've noticed a house difference
your eyes will look refreshed after a few minutes
depending on how rushed i am in the morning
i tried it at night
which means i wake up puffy every day.
physically depuff with in minutes
i just used this for the first time this morning
night after i wash my face
it's amazing for my morning routine
now im using it in the morning
so on those nights i use this
i also like to use this in the morning.
setting the mood for the day
only used this at night
make up heavy at the end of each day
so for the people saying that the scent got all over their pajamas
night with this on my face
woke up with no morning wrinkles
whenever i put this on
good for overnight though
usually in the morning
when i woke up this morning after putting it on last night i was genuinely surprised to see that in fact there were results
after 1 use at night time
when i did my makeup the next day
every day i applied at night
i apply it nightly after i cleanse
literally the next day i went
last night i was getting ready to go out
use it every single day
i put it on in the morning before moisturizer
at night before my other serum
i am good to skip the make up application on the weekends now
it lingers for a good half hour
i didn't really notice a difference until one day after about 10 days of using this i opened my phone camera
just days after starting to use it i'm watching my skin change
i am using this morning
lasting throughout the day
i put on 2 drops after washing my face in the morning
before bed woke up next morning didn't need any foundations or bb creams it's majic in a bottle i ❤️ it recommend it to everyone
after only 2 days of use i came to bed
at least on my bottle
a light amount on the weekends if i'm running err
then go in with this on my luna 2
it was either due to the sun
although i only spent about 20 mins in the sun walking to class
i recommend using it at night
maybe not every single night
only use this in the morning
often 2 pumps at the end of the day
i love this face wash for day to day use
congested at the end of the day
terrible for travel or in the shower
the eye cream is great in the morning.
i like the eye cream for the morning.
i love this eye cream for the morning!
i still use a more intense cream at night
it's great for rushed mornings when i don't have time to wait for my eye cream to sink in
i put it on at night
i did enjoy using it at night
almost immediately notice my skin tone evening out
perfect for the summer
with that being said during the summer time this cream is god
upon waking up in the morning
on sleepless nights i pair it with guerlain's midnight secret
i now have a very tight morning
i reapply it after i get home when i take off my makeup before the gym
this is the main part of my daily routine
now to see how my skin looks in the morning !
i only us this at night
i love using this after washing off makeup in the evening
this cream is great to use both morning
i went back to sephora the next day to buy it.
the next morning woke up with glowing skin
light at the same time
l applied it at night before i went to bed
you can skip to timestamp 8:00 minutes or watch the full video for other glow-giving sephora faves
i am in my mid-30s
every time i put it on, i feel so refreshed!
i wish sunday riley comes up with an eye cream- i'd be all over it :
i am on my second bottle
i used it mostly at night
i apply this in the mornings
at night after cleansing
i only use this in the morning
then i started using it as my daytime moisturizer- especially when i plan on wearing make up for over 12 hours
i love it on its own in summer
with an oil in winter
i started using it on vacation in very dry
dry at the same time
i will say that i think i personally need to use another night cream after for extra hydration as i do wake up in the morning with a oily t-zone
put this product on in the morning
i used it last night
every single one would break me out badly within about 12hrs
i am using this without any additional cream during the day
i woke up this morning with my face feeling fresh
tery when you wake up
i chose this for the summer because my skin gets oiler during the day
great for summer weather.
i am planning to back off further with the face wash
in his mid 30s
once in the morning
i put it on at night
let it do its job throughout the night
this was love at first wash
first time in my life i'm buying the same moisturizer for the second time
i applied this at noon.
the weather is always dry during the month of january where we go
i put it on every night right after my drunk elephant serum
i always dry by the end of the day
of this with one of my orders that allowed me to use this for about a month as a night moisturizer
great right before bed.
i've finally found one that works perfectly in the mornings
with just this once or twice a day my skin is great
my skin is dry by the end of the day
i apply this before bed
in the mornings before my makeup
i put this on immediately after washing my face at night
it's perfect for day/night use
perfect for a summer season.
jart water drop at my local sephora
i find long lasting results until my next shower
i put it on in the morning instead of primer
i live in a cold
this is my favorite thing to put on my face first thing in the morning
can look dewey throughout the day
u held onto it waiting for midwest winter to arrive to put this product to the dry skin test
applying it once a day
i only used this at night
it would feel great after a day at the beach.
i get extremely oily in my t-zone during the day
at night i use the seaberry oil
i used at night
in the am after washing my face
night time only, one pump for both eyes.
i am on my second bottle
pm for about 2 weeks
even with nightly use
i only use it at night.
just 4 days into using this morning
i noticed results the very next day
this is now my favorite night time eye cream.
s to work them into my routine
the rest of the routine
t sets all night
refreshed in the morning
i woke up once a few mornings ago
the picture attached is what i've used after a little over a month of using it every night
i know this will be part of my daily routine
i put it on at night
t's not something that i'd use in the morning
i love using it after my evening shower
its now a must have staple in my morning routine
i applied it at night before my toner
when i get up in the mornings
waking up in the morning
i switched to using this product at night before i go to bed
this is now my go-to after sun regimen for my face
can only use it at night
went back to play with it again on my lunch hour next day
i only use it at night
in the evenings i apply a bit heavier
i am happy with this oil because i use it at bed time
youthful in the morning
like a day at the spa finish and feel :)
on a nightly basis i use 5 drops of product for my whole face before bed
i apply it before bed
allow my face to absorb it over night
i am in my early 30s
the first week i applied morning
decided that nighttime application of sk-11 was the only way for me
using it only at night works perfect
so after i get in bed i apply
6ounce bottle will last a long time
i also like to use it at nighttime to stay moisturized through the night
i put this product on right before bed.
with the winter weather i had been dry
now the next morning
evening prior to my daily moisturizer
even after a rigorous workout at the gym
during the day i put this on first
not have to blot or powder every hour
i do my night ritual
i let it set for 10 minutes before going to sleep
i woke up the next morning
cold here in winter
especially during the winter
i really enjoy using this sleeping pack
when i woke up that next morning
ready to go about my day
waking up in the morning tho is the best feeling because i no longer see tired-dull face
i don't sleep much at night
i put it on a few minutes before my makeup
i noticed on my commute to work when looking in the mirror
all day, even a 12 hour work day!!!!!!
on days when it's 105 degrees outside my skin still takes a beating from the heat
that night i was at a local sephora
the moment i put this on
i put it on in the morning and at night.
when i touch my face in the morning
not only is it my go-to every single day to fake awake
i start work at 6 or 7 am everyday
i even carry it in my bag to work for a 2pm pick me up with my coffee
i woke up the next morning with the skin around my eyes bright red
it will continue to be part of my daily routine
usually i use it after my nightly routine after using my toner
in the morning i use it after my morning routine.
love it for long nights up with the baby.
i love reapplying it for an extra boost to the eyes throughout the day
i am using the first balm right now
i need 2 one for at home that i keep in the refrigerator
i put it on in the morning before my makeup
dark due to long work hours
i let the cooling sensation last for 5-10 minutes before applying my eye cream for the day
a nice "mini spa" day in the morning!
i tried it both day and night at home first.
the cooling effect lasts for hours
i used it yesterday night
i did my regular routine
used it all in one go after back to back nights of not-very-much-sleep/partying
as long as the rest of my before bed routine takes
i wear this alone or on top of my daily night cream
saw a difference in the morning.
smooth my skin was the morning after using this
in the morning is worth it
i prefer applying it at night
started twice w the same results
i add this to the nude progenius firming youth oil at night
night time cream everyday
i used this every night.
when i'm going to the gym
it recently got super bad when i started wearing makeup for 12+ hours
occasionally on my face in the shower
i am currently using this in the morning with herbivore's lapis oil
at night with their moonfruit treatment as my evening moisturizer
which i find really pleasant at the end of the day
at least for my skin
i like to use it at night
every time i use it i see a huge difference in my skin the very next morning
i usually do it at night
i keep the mask on for about an hour vs the 15 minutes it recommends because i have relatively oily skin
after 1 week of use it's smooth
this is a great face lotion for during the day or to wear at night if you're going out
when i need sun block
sometimes when i'm lazy i don't use night cream in several days
wear no make up during the sunny days
i recently worked a convention under harsh lights for long hours
also tight at the same time
bonus: if i use it at night
after the second it was dewy
i used this all winter
i plan on using it over the summer because i spend a lot of time outdoors golfing
i live in the northwest territories where the weather reaches -40 in the winter
i normally use it during the day before going out
ready for the day
i am going to use one in cold times too
calm through the day
it wakes up the face
in my morning shower
i've noticed my skin tone is evening out
another time at night
s in the shower
i can see the results overnight.
it did knock out a fine line i noticed this morning- within 3 hours of application
when i wake up in the morning
use it at night
for me this is okay since i am using during this cold weather
before my make-up regimen
i did use 2 of the small balls last night
see where my skin st
great for a night cream, to heavy for day time.
softer in the morning
8 hours after application i am not oily
i work under harsh / hot lights for 12 hours
still at the end of the day i can count on this product
it lasted all day for me in 90 degree weather
lasted on me for about 10 hrs
i did my makeup around 5 pm
my makeup still looked perfect the following day
put it on as the last step of night routine
wake up with poreless skin
i added this to my daily morning routine.
stays on all day long
" the first day i wore it to work
to stay in place all day
i do my basic morning routine wash
my makeup last 12 hours with out settling in to lines
my makeup stays in place all day with this on
make it last all day
i put this on in the morning
my makeup lasts from 7 am to 11 pm when i wash it off
normally in the winter my nose will run
now it stays on through classes
after my 10 hour shifts my foundation is still in place
been applying in the mornings
this is a part of my morning routine from now on.
i love using it in the mornings
keeps it on until you take it off at the end of the day
i wear foundation for 10hrs or more everyday
almost impossible to get make up to stay a full 8-12 hour day
this product gives me over 12 hours of fresh stay on appearance
i went to a concert last weekend
my makeup looked so good even at the end of day.
it even held up my blush which is usually gone by afternoon
i put it on in the am
it works well as a sleep pack
firming at the same time
recommend to use it at bedtime
i feel like when i wake up in the morning with jelly pack
i really like what this product does for my pre-makeup morning routine
my makeup did not move for over 12 hours.
if you put this on the night before you will wake up with glowing skin
also great for in the shower
the directions on the bottle say to use this 1-2 times a day
after the first night after using this product
the morning after my first use my skin was less red
every other day or so
usually by the morning
already spend time st
during the day with my primer
my skin is all over the board with one day dry
before it was available on sephora
i am in my early 20s
still a half hour after washing my face
leave on for about 15-30 minutes
i went out an purchased it after a week of trying it at home
when i woke up
i got a mini facial in store on friday
the next day i tried the mask
get compliments on it the very next day
i leave this on for up to 40 minutes without a problem
i tried this out last night and it is amazing.
i woke up this morning with a great complexion
i left it on for 15 minutes before bed
when i washed my face in the morning
i used it today for the first time around 10am edt because i had a little breakout happening on my chin
i left it on for an hour actually instead of 30 minutes
within 4 hours after i've cleansed my skin in the morning
i just got these yesterday
at the end of the work day
use them to blot throughout the day
by the end of the day i only have minimum shine
ntrigued by this product when i saw it on the new at sephora page
i used this from 4pm till 9pm.
shine free for hours
i get a shiny t zone during spring/summer time
12 hours later no shine at all
it helped to keep the shine at bay for most of the day
i ordered this product thursday
paid the extra to have it delivered friday since i was
friday afternoon i applied it after work as a mid/end-of-day oil touch-up
i kept that makeup on for over 12 hours
i used this at night
use it every day
i only use it in the day
glowy after one week
i love putting this on in the morning when i have puffiness
i woke up in the morning
more alert especially in the morning
in the morning i use it with my fab eye duty triple remedy am eye cream
i do use this at nighttime too
especially in the mornings
i just looked overall more awake
under makeup or in the evening
however in the summer in the south i'll still have a place for this in my lotions
for those hot summer afternoons when you still wanna wear a bit of make up
my face is not as oily during the day
especially during the winter
winter as my daily
in the morning after washing my face
for that i love this as a night cream
when i wake up in the morning my skin looks like it has a glow
my skin would look dry again as the day went on
i decided to try the night bright set
i apply every night before bed
i'd break out if i used this every day
night after i wash my face with peekee bar
i find it too heavy for daytime use
i still use this at night
i tried it in the morning vrs application at night
i like it at night better before bed after i cleanse my face
its also not to heavy to wear during the summer
i am more on the dry side
supple in the morning after applying this the night before
not just for the night for what
i apply it at night
i also use retin-a at night
after using this cream at night i wake up with such a smooth face
used it in my morning routine before my makeup
i like to use it at night
combo in the winter
i currently only use it at night
i want to start trying it in the mornings too
while this cream was too thick to use during the day in summer
the weather in my area
especially if i pair it with sunday riley's tidal
have gone into work with 20 minutes sleep
in the morning my skin looks rested
i used this last night
i went to bed late knowing i wouldn't get more than a few hours sleep
looked like i had slept 8 hours
i put it on before bed when i was about to have like 4 hours of sleep
i just look like i've had 8 hours of sleep i don't use it every night or every morning
i usually put it on before i get into the shower
let it set for about 10 minutes
after i use it
i seriously throw it on a few minutes before i hop in the shower in the morning
this is a 3 minute mask.
i got this in my monthly sephora box
i gave it four stars because i wish the glow did last all day
i put this on for the first time
once my play sample runs out i will be purchasing this to use in my daily routine
i can still smell it off my face hours into a hospital round
definitely added into my daily routine!
especially not at the end of the day.
in the mornings, under makeup, yes please!
worth having to add to your finishing product collection for those days that you didn't sleep enough the night before
that is until my husb
for days where i go to campus
perfect for any day!
i never smell it after the first hour or so though
i find it hydrating as soon as i wake up in the morning
this is going to be a staple in my morning routine
on days when i feel like i'm super tired
gets your face ready for a night out
yesterday i was having a no makeup day
went about my day
don't like to spend a lot of time getting ready in the morning
by the end of the day
also on its own on the weekends when i leave my skin more bare
back in the day
i love it during the day over my other perricone treatments
i put it on in the evening after whatever serum i'm going to use
when i wake up
this is a nourishing oil to use as my last step in my nighttime routine
this is my new morning and evening oil.
if you add just a small drop in the morning
i will layer an extra light moisturizer since i work in an office setting with ac blasting all day
on nights i'm not using this its because i'm using a prescription renti-a
i like this for morning.
before i go to bed
murad time release in the morning
this started clearing it up the very next day
i'll be using it every day from now on.
spend the money on another tube once i finish this one
i now use this every day as part of my beauty routine
ready for the day
during the winter time my skin was so dry
this does the job every morning.
clean after every use
ready for next steps in my skin care routine
i love using this in the morning.
gets my skin ready for the day
i used it last night
it works great as a morning refresher
lasts throughout the day
i only use it to prime under my skin for makeup in the morning or just to use as a moisturizer during the day
have absolutely had it with this nj spring/summer weather
it lasts all day
figured i'd give it a go on a day when i wasn't planning on wearing makeup at all
normal/combo in the summer
am always battling the 3pm shine
this stuff gets me through almost my whole workday without blotting
does help combat the shine during the day
i'd have no problem using this on a weekend with my sister or at home
its definitely a start in the routine
worth having in the event of hangovers
or waking up late enough to eliminate any form of your st
i got it in my clinique 10 days calendar.
but once i used it morning and night, i love it!
am writing this review at 8:00pm
can be used morning
i exchanged it today for this.
before i put on spf in the morning
i love this product at night after i scrub the day off my face
sometimes at night as well
use it generously at night
i will continue to use this cream until the end of my days
soft in the morning
i love this in the evening
although it won't make my every day routine
i only wear this at night
it is great for day and night .
clear in the morning
every night before i go to bed i mix it with two drops of the josie maran aragon oil
when i wake up in the morning my skin feels soft
i can go an entire day with applying only in the morning
at the end of the day
smooth after wearing all day
i admit i skipped cleaning last night
box which is all about holiday glow!
in the morning before my foundation
i applied it at night after washing my face
while this will not become a part of my daily routine
loved it so much i made the hour or so trek to a real sephora to buy it

i always wake up in the morning with an oily
upon the first night of using this moisturizer in the morning i woke up
i mean i have almost an immediate reaction where the next day i wake up with pimples
it's now the second night i've used it
depending on if its night or day
my nighttime routine is the same up until the eye serum
i usually get oily after 3 hours
i think using one pump a day as part of my morning routine will allow it to last up to a year

other areas throughout the day
this kept me matter for 8 hours which was good enough for a dull day at work
it is my go to all year round
oily in the spring/summer/fall
does stay matte for about 2-3 hours on my face before i have to pull out my blotting papers
it still gave my skin an unwanted shine in the summer months
not sure if it lasts 8 hours.
last all day without getting greasy
i keep this in my gym bag for when i workout after work
this has became part of my staple morning routine
after about 8-9 hours into my daybi start getting oily patches
doing touch up powder every couple of hours
i am already on the 2nd one

used it last night
fell asleep with my makeup on :
i used this when i woke with my clinique 7 day scrub
i love putting on sublime every morning
i used it last night
put this on before going to bed
on no make-up days
you get a little lazy at the end of the day
i usually use it in the morning in place of a regular cleanser
it's also great for nights when i'm too tired to go through a multi-step cleansing routine
especially after a long day of work when i forget that i'm wearing make
i'll also use this before going out at night to remove my day makeup
i used it before a trip last night
i put this stuff on them 2x a day
i woke up from my nap to see my spot has gotten smaller
i tried this that same day after washing my face
then 3-4 drops at night depending on the condition of my skin
whenever i get an acne it is usually because my monthly period is coming up
how i use: one drop per facial area in morning
i used it that night, and guys, it was overnight.
i just kept applying at night
will be starting the martian toner tomorrow
the second week i had my purging episode
applied everyday in the morning after shower for a week
i apply ufo every night after i wash my face
then one morning i woke up
only use it at night
after a week your skin should stop purging
i only use this in my night time skin care routine
this is part of my morning routine
my morning routine is expensive
morning and night after washing.
i found myself one morning going to work with no face makeup
then at night out with friends
i added the luna to my nighttime routine as the last step mainly
occasionally i'll use a little in the morning
so the first night that i used this oil i woke up the next day
i also use this daily on my upper back
let it sink in for about half an hour
during the day i add it to my spf
i swear after a week
sunday riley's ufo face oil has put that to an end
the morning after my first application
my skin thanks me for it in the morning
i apply 2-3 drops after my night time moisturizer every night before i go to sleep
i put this on at night
let it sit for about 15 minutes
wash it all off in the morning
if you put it on at night
when i woke up in the morning my skin looked so healthy
i notice a difference after using it two nights
it's day 3 of my period
this is likely to be in my beauty routine year-round
o to use with it at night
it's fine since i'm just at home
i recommend using it before bed instead of the morning so you don't have to walk around feeling like an oil slick all day
i recently picked at my face waking up the next morning with bit red spots on my face
woke up 4 hrs later
i only wear this at night
went to bed without it
the very next day i went to the store
i put it on twice a day after a toner
it has cleared up my skin so well after just using for a week at night
i woke up the next morning
i leave this on for 15-30
it begins to dry down
i love using this if i feel particularly groggy in the morning after a late night
i love putting this on after a long day.
i would use it at night sometimes before bed so when i wake up the next morning
the first night i tried it
i used this last night
woke up this morning with less oil
after about 2 hours the redness started to go away
applied it upon returning home from my shopping trip
personally love it after cleansing in the morning before makeup application
despite having terrible sleep for a week
like i have usually been waking up with
looked like i got a days worth of sleep
didn't show results on first time
well i put it on for about ten minutes before bed
i like to use it after a long day
i woke up the morning after using it
tried this last night
5 days later i came back to houston
i let it stay on my face for an hour.
the next day my skin was so bright
i also recommend using the mask at night.
after reading reviews of how sticky this mask is i waited until the weekend when i had some extra time before my shower to hang around in a mask
great addition to my cold weather routine.
i instantly logged in to buy the full pack
followed the directions to use day
i am on my third bottle now.
for the colder winter days
it doesn't work over night
once in the morning after i was my face

i mix it with my foundation every morning
felt comfortable wearing it during the day
no use this in the morning after i cleanse tone
felt good the next day when applied the night before

keep up with your nightly
i left it on for about an hour.
when up the next morning my face was glowing.
i woke up this morning
the day after i used this my skin was glowing i was getting comments about it
also bartend at night
average about 5hrs of sleep sometimes less on weekends
i wake up looking refreshed
when i put it on in the morning
i look like i've slept for 10 hours
when i put it on at night i don't look like i've worked all day
i usually do a double cleanse at night
most likely will be using the llittle leona at night because i like to really get in there in my pm cleansing
the aqua bomb at night for around 2-3 weeks with pretty great results
at night right before bed
i like to use it overnight
morning for better results
used it after my week long desert trip

i leave it on for 15
came back to buy it the next day
the first time i used it i immediately saw results
i left in on for around 20 minutes

but i am getting off topic here.
the next morning my face looked glowing.
calmer in the morning
s before i go to bed
follow it with a night cream
i kept it on about 20 minutes before my shower
left on for 15 minutes
it is a great addition to my morning routine.
since i only do this at night
will enjoy it while it lasts
i recommend leaving it on overnight
tried it out tonight
when you wake up the set morning your face is supple
made it feel so smooth the next day
the next morning her acne had all
have used it before sleeping
the first night i used it
i woke up the next morning
you'll defenetly see the result the next morning
my skin tone is evening out
before this i would get breakouts daily
use this at night
om break out right before an important event
if i use it on the same spot for consecutive nights
leave it over night
that's only because i apply it once at night
i put a small amount of this on the acne spots 3 times a day for one day
when i woke up the next day
use this at night only
i can only use it at night
in addition to using it as part of my morning routine
i like to use it if i'm going out in the evening to freshen up without doing a full face re-do
i only spend about 2 or 3 minutes twice a day massaging this creamy goodness into my face before the rest of my routine
i love the milk to wash my face in the morning.
especially when my skin needs a nice pick me up in the morning
the oils stay at bay all day
this is a good gentle morning addition to my routine
at the same time clean
it's bring life to my face especially in the morning
recently i have added this product into my nighttime routine
when i wake up in the morning after using i feel so hydrated
used this the morning after a late night out before my moisturizer
woke up in the morning
i can't wait until i finish the other cleanser i am using
i used it both morning
this year i'm fighting the dry start to winter with smoother
i love it, day and night.
this plus with the wild rose 24 hr moisturizer is the first combo that has kept my skin comfortably balanced all day
i go the extra mile
press it in following the directions
will fit seamlessly into any morning routine
put it on last night only to wake up to a literal miracle
so this is the first step i use when taking makeup off after a long day or night out
most days i just wash it off
refreshed in the morning
you just wake up looking refreshed
i leave it on for anywhere from 5-30 minutes
i usually do this once a week at night
i do it at night after cleansing
half way thru the 1st application you get the hang of it
will def be adding this into my routine 1-2 times a week
because on my second time using it
takes over 30 minutes to do entire face
one day when i was lacking seriously sleep
i tried this at night
leave it on for a full 10 minutes or more
both in their late 50s
it made her foundation go on flawlessly the next day
after 15 minutes of the mask
but i tried it one night when i was bored.
i used it last night
looked like it does after i get a good night sleep while using a night mask
i put it on in the morning
left it on for about 10 minutes while i finished my coffee
then went about my normal saturday activities of cleaning my house
put it on for 5 minutes
my skin looks younger the next morning
finished with my regular routine
ter the next morning so soft
just got it yesterday
i stopped using my luna the next day
its because i am using it morning
i just used this after being out all day in the sun
this mask is an at home hydrafacial!
i used this mask for the first time this morning after seeing it on the today show
i left it on for the full 15 minutes
it is drying in the morning
i saw instant results from the first over night use
after prolonged use i was able to go from a whole over night layer daily use to just spot treatments when i thought i needed it
i saw results the very next day.
she used it before she went to sleep
ended up ordering a bottle the next day
this is a product that perfect for morning cleaning routine
in the mornings i use the ole hendriksen balance skin care routine
prep my face for the day/night
every morning when i wake up my skin looks bright
mix this with lush's let the good times roll day/night
i immediately saw how refreshed
my face is red for about an hour afterwards
will definitely be in my daily beauty routine
decided to try it again when summer comes
live in a humid area
my tone is evening
felt so soft every morning
use at night while using this in the morning
that was not the case the next morning after i used this stuff
feels better in the morning
i realized the other day
use it at night before i go to bed leaving my face very moisturized
soft when i wake up in the morning
works great as a day or a night cream
definitely good for mornings
i put it on at 10am
especially during the winter
i've enjoyed using it at night as the final step in my routine as well as in the morning as the only product i use prior to going to the gym
at the 3 week mark after using this daily i decided to get the serum too
more on the dry side during this cold winter
again when i woke up in the morning
if i want a glow in the morning
i wake up to glowing skin the next day
i originally bought to use as a nighttime cream
like it for both morning
its just lightweight enough to use in the morning
plan on getting it sometime soon
this is the kind of serum that makes you look awake in the morning
i only use this at night
looking like i've been sleeping 24 hours a day healthy
like i'm going to the gym
i started with once a day
have worked up to morning
usually feel disgusting by mid-day
gross by the end of the work day
depending on the season
so after watching the video
stays on through work an happy hour
it was no where near the l'oréal
then i look in the mirror in the bathroom at work
i also use it on weekends when i run err
was very comfortable and lasted all day.
however with my oily skin it does start to move in the afternoon
i wore it for 12 hours
stays on all day
i took a nap with this cream on
stays on all day
no shine all day.
even look that lasts until i take it off in the evening
maybe on the next go round it???
as the redness relief only lasts a half hour to an hour
it lasts all day.
after applying it at sephora
a new possible fav in my nighttime routine!!!
i always leave it on for about a minute for the extra treatment
the next day i wake up
followed by a heavy night cream
i leave it on for like 1 minute
this product is a staple in my nightly routine.
i just got this yesterday
every other day i use the clinique one
i also use it twice a week as a one minute mask for extra hydration
just massage on face for about a minute
after watching some late night tv
goes away after like 5 minutes or after i wash my face
yet gentle at the same time
i usually use this before a shower
it goes on white at first
i put this on at 6am
this helps my foundation from breaking down until about 4pm which is amazing for me
i put it on at night.
i apply it morning
i only use it at night since it's heavy.
my next experiment is to try it on a morning where i've been up all night
i like to use this at night
if i use it before bed after a night of drinking
i apply this under my eyes after i wash my face morning
some people claim that there are no under eye darkness after putting this on in the evening
when you get up the next morning
i applied a small amount every night before bed
i used this once before bed time
when i woke up
get a full 8 hours of sleep
each packet lasts me about a week using morning
i occasionally use it in the day time
the directions on the tub say to use it twice a day
i do notice a difference when i put it on as well as when i wake-up in the morning
one "day" packet lasts me 2-3 days if i use it morning or night
it works great for me in the mornings.
i put it on at night before i go to sleep
i put it on in the morning before i start my makeup routine
am waiting until next week to see what their black friday specials are
also use it as my day cream
even after long nights with very little sleep
use it day & night.
i wake up to a new face every morning.
literally i woke up in the morning after applying it for the first time
at night before going to sleep
i went throughout my day as usual
later on that night
used it that night
i love that my skin still feels moisturized when i wake up in the morning after using it at night
i tried it at night first
wear this at night
wake up with beautiful
wear this in daytime
then my skin is dry hours later
when i wake up in the morning
when i wash my face at night
i do notice a difference in my skin when i use it from day to day
makeup on from 7am-9ish pm
it is now a ritual to apply every night.
love how my skin feels the next morning
have used it every day/night since
i put it on kind of heavy the 1st night because my skin was so red
i put it on heavier at night
lighter during the day
it's the first cream i've seen a make noticeable difference after waking up the next morning
love this cream, i used it morning and night.
before the bed the results in one week are very notice
i used a small amount morning and night.
i alternate this between another night cream i am using

i am using it at night only right now
when i go to bed
it lasts all day

put this on at night and it lasts.
morning and night, it's all i need.
only use it at night
i can see the difference in the morning
then total repairing in the evening
i got their morning serum last week
as soon as i started using am/pm together my skin completely transformed
started to use it only in the evenings
i switched to only putting it on at night
i've tried this in snow weather
i only use it as night cream
was planning on returning it
i only use this at night
i started using it on my face at night
i put this on every night
except that this morning i woke up after wearing it at night
the corrector in this line during the day
just at night works fine!
the other tiger grass with spf should be used during the day
its been freezing here
good for nighttime use.
especially in the winter time
i prayed that i wouldn't wake up with new patches of bumps in the morning
when i wake up in the morning my skin looks so much healthier
every night i use it
the next day i wake up with literally the most even glowing complexion
after reading what this was
i used this the first night after i got this
i used this again last night
i apply it heavier at night.
the first night i tried this cream
not red over night
in the morning it felt 100% better
the morning after the first night i used it my skin felt soft
i only used this that night
healthier when i woke up in the morning
i just purchased this cream this weekend
when i woke up this morning
i went a little crazy on the salicylic acid one night
yesterday i decided to get it in store
just got this today at a store
am off foundation for awhile
i still become a bit shiny late afternoon
which provided just enough for my every day running around
let it sink in before putting this on in the mornings
on days i need to sleep in
don't use every day
i noticed after wearing this product on a long day
until i apply my foundation
i wear it nearly every day
on sunny days, i apply to my arms as well.
lasts the entire day
this is one of my every day products.
it's almost too much for me on a day to day basis now
i've left it on overnight
just don't leave it on overnight
i wear this to work in the summer as my "foundation"
i prefer not wearing foundation day to day
after washing my face in the morning
i often just apply it in the morning
everything is going to slide off in several hours
when i first apply this
when i want to go makeup free on the weekend
today i got out of the shower
until i found this
by the 6th day
i am in my late 40's
i used it the day after
i actually went out all day on saturday without any make up on
i wear make up almost every day.
i've always hated waking up in the morning
done product to end your night
also wanted to feel like my face was clean at the end of the night when i shower in the morning
i added this to my routine after hearing about it from gothamista
i still cleanse my face as the next step in my nighttime routine
this is the first time i am taking time to review a product
i tried this for the first time tonight
could use this at the end of the day
at the end of the day its charcoal
especially in the winter
i wash my face with it in the evening to remove my make up
n the morning to simply clean my face
typically sleep in my make-up
the very next day i went back to sephora
all nighter setting spray
i'll skip eating out a few times to get this
wake up to a calm morning face
so now i use it on my body after i take a shower
i leave it on over night.
i decided to give it a try after my shower one night
left it on overnight
then next day my skin was glowing.
the difference this has made right at that time of the year when your skin starts getting yucky from sleeping with the heat running all night is just incredible
anyway after 10 minutes i put my make up on
i apply this mask on morning and evening.
i can't comment on lifting because i'm in my early 30s
my t-zone mattified nearly the whole day
i want to use this morning
sometimes i'm in a hurry because i have poor time management skills in the early morning
last night i thought i'd try it alone because i was tired
i put it on at night
refreshed in the morning
even at the end of day
when i apply it in the evening
wake up in the morning my skin is super soft
makes me greasy at the end of the day
i applied it one night
a miracle in the colder weather we have been having in the northeast
even though i am just in my late 20s
perfect with make up in the morning.
usually i can't use a cream during a day
i really like it that when i awaken the next morning after wearing this overnight
loved using it during the day under my make up
it's a pick me up throughout the day.
use this during the day
this is not over night
i put it on this morning

i like that for the evening
took a chance on this product after reading the reviews
i love using this product mostly at night
i used this at night when my skin is very dry.
i like to finish my night routine with this
i used it on a few of my problem areas at night
feel of the skin on my face- after only 4 days
as someone in their early 20's
most nights i just use it as an eye cream
when i wake up in the morning my face looks so refreshed it's almost as if i had a facial overnight
its my daily night time routine
i apply it an hour before bed for a nourishing overnight face treatment
press it on your face
the next morning i woke up
when i wake up
i forgot to put it one one night last week

look when i wake in the morning
this morning is the first i've woken up with no dryness
each night before bed
then peel shortly thereafter
i like to put it on at night
then i wake up in the morning with a total glow
i am only on day 3

i am in my early 30s with combination skin
it is now a must for my daily routine.
luxurious especially when you're having a long day/week
i used this combo for the first time today
prefect for travel or take on as a carry on!
especially in the winter
i wash my face about twice a day
i don't think i have time to double cleanse every day/night
drier patachs depending on that time of the month
i used this morning
i do it at night before bed
last night was day 3
thought it would add too much time to my routine in the morning
this couldn't have arrived at a better time.
am already in love with the cleanse travel set
today i decided to put it to the test
next was the bar.
about 2 months of evening cleanse
when used every night
i did notice my face feeling a little dry later on in the evening
while i'm not sure i'll ever be great at making this a nightly routine
work at the same time
the set is a great addition to anyone's night time routine
i proceeded with my evening skincare routine
my skin was softer than usual in the morning
i look forward to using this in my daily routine from here on out
calm set now for 2 nights
had the chance to finally use it tonight with my routine
i look forward to my new nightly routine.
here are my thoughts on this product after using about a week
for the next week my face look very soft
definitely the perfect size for weekend getaways or even weeklong trips
i will continue to use this till the end
it's an enjoyable process for me though as i am one to take time to enjoy my skincare during the night
for at least the night
they should go the next morning after use of the mask
i did feel smoother the next morning
works against any foundation i use during the day
have been using it daily am/pm
i wake up very early for work
i get 7-8 hours of sleep
had amazing results overnight.
i like to use as my second cleanse at night
so glad i added this to my nightly routine!
i applied it before bed
that's after using it daily on my face
this healed the area overnight
i woke up this morning and my skin healed!!!!!
it worked best for me at night
i love using it before i go to bed on my face
it is perfect to use before bed
wore it around for about 14 hours of the day
i continued to use every other day
i put on a little bit at bed time
i typically put this one at night
the next day my skin was completely back to normal
if you use it before bed
i apply it at night
pat it into my skin at night
have been applying it to my entire face nightly
depending on my mood i sometimes just leave it on in the morning
other days i wash it off
from now on i will use it at night
works great for overnight/bedtime.
i saw that this was on the 100pt perk this week
you apply it at night before bedtime since it will affect vision
i also like use it all over my face on days when i know i am going to be in cold weather like when skiing
i live in a cold
the effects of one evening use lasted all throughout the next day
within an hour they looked soft
this must be what they put on edward for twilight
again when i woke up this morning
thinking because i am in the pool almost every day with strong chemicals
it broke open the weekend in early winter
cold rain so much over the couple of days
have been using it at night when i go to bed
half way through the winter
i leave it on for about 10 minutes
i left this on for about 20 minutes
i used it on a no make up day
perfect for the summer.
i put it on at night before bed n wake up to a perfect glowy look
the line "for faking an afterglow without the sweat session" is very true
chest highlight for the beach or summertime
more like on days where i go makeup free
apply this in the morning after my serum
i do not crease throughout the day.
this product is great to hide the fact that you stayed up all night the day before
if i wake up too late
i used it in the morning before applying my makeup
it does help reduce the tired look that i get in the mornings
if you want a near-perfect before-bed eye cream
i literally get 5-6 hours of sleep on a good day
it makes me feel so much better about waking up a million times during the night with my baby
stays in place all day
especially during cold weather
i put this under my eyes in the morning right after i shower
is applied it in the morning before going to work
brightening with just a few nights of use
meant to be a last step over your normal pm routine
put it over your night cream
when i woke up in the morning
i literally woke up every morning with a moisture skin everyday
i used it before going to bed a couple of times.
when i woke up the next morning
hurray i still use it morning
both times when i woke up
put it on at night
i stoppped using it for a couple days because i forgot to pack it for my vacation
i finally got home today
only a week with the fresh br
by that i mean i'm early 40s
i used it as an overnight cream
in the morning my face looked so good
i am more than happy to see my fresh face overnight
i am in my late 20s
my skin was happy for the next 24 hours
this worked with just one day of am
ran out to sephora the very next day to purchase this
i am in my late 30's
this product is my last stop on my search
when you wake up the next morning your skin feels br
even after waking up my skin looked
i used it for only two nights before i decided to splurge
i love the way my face felt in the morning when i woke up
i enjoy that i can use this day or night
especially in the winter
leaving an all day glow
i put on after cleansing at night
the first day i used 2 full pumps
i tried again the next day
my makeup stays on even after a day in 110 degree heat
it stays put all day
at the end of the day
i even wore it at the beach on a few no-makeup days during vacation
healthy by the end of the day
this fabulous primer hold it in place for up to 24 hours
that's okay because my ud setting spray makes it last all day/night
wear it alone on weekends or during outdoor activity with a little spf over it
to apply in the morning before foundation
at first i used it while traveling
i started using it in my morning routine
kept my makeup on for 10 hours !
my makeup stays on from when i wake up
till when i get home
my face doesnt end up feeling dry at the end of the day
i don't wear a lot of make-up most weekdays
around 3 pm my starts getting really oily
i woke up the next day to clearer skin the first time i used this
use it to freshen up after a long trip
have used it every night to take my makeup off at the end of the night
at the same time
don't sleep on this one!
the product stayed on all day
i used it today
it feels amazing when left on for like an hour
i leave it on for about 20-30 min.
i leave it on for about 15 minutes
this dramatically calms my skin during whichever crisis it's having at the time
i used this last night
that afternoon i happened to stop by sephora
i applied halfway through my 10 hours in the air
i used this at night before bedtime
i used this mask for 10 minutes
this is now part of my weekly routine
this product works much better if you leave it on over night as a sleeping mask or even as a night cream
next morning i woke up with the smoothest my skin has been in a long time
used this on my husb
the 1st time i used it
when i woke up the next morning
i am eagerly looking to buy the rest of the evercalm series once my face cream
the next day it was still red
cold day out on the ski hill
use the oil during the am routine
at night only use the cream
if it's windy or snowy outside
is ready for my make up routine
it's just the first day using this
i can't wait to put it on tomorrow morning.
especially in the daytime.
i will use this as instructed both morning
i love that i get to skip a step in the morning
this product made my makeup stay on even after a full face underwater in the pool
ed in evening out my overall skin tone
it makes it last throughout the day
for me the difference is night
i only use it at night.
continue using this in my daytime routine
don't find myself needing to powder or blot in the afternoon
it looks like i have nothing on 3 hours into my work day
did it before a holiday party
new take on a st
i always use oil at night
t working this winter season
you can use it day or night
i only used it in the morning
i wash my face every morning
right after the shower i use this
so at night i put it on after my retinol
in the morning i put it on before my relatively "heavy" sunscreen
i put this on at night
s after every use
took this to use when i was staying in a hotel for several days as the air tends to be so dry
i've used it every night since
i put it on at night
i am so used to heavy
i will absolutely use this post-shower
slather it on before/after a flight
used it up in a hot minute
each morning it was even better.
avoid my t-zone during the day
after a few days of using this cream after my regular face washing routine
i used it tonight after i did a peel
i am new at all this
i imagine that after an incident with a long day in the weather
try it for day
i put it on at night after i clean my face from wearing makeup all day
then left for a long weekend trip.
am ordering the cream online right after i hit the submit
in the evening before bed
it's great in the morning
as the day goes on
hot as the day goes on
it makes my morning routine more simple
when i am in a rush
perfect for weekends at the pool as spf or for at the gym
its perfect for the after gym routein.
i can't wait to use this in the summer with the spf
i begin using it that next day.
i've only ever used it over makeup/on-the-go when i start to get oily during the day
i put some on in the morning after i've done my makeup
before i go out at night
see their masterpiece from 7 am last till that hot date
i apply this after my setting spray on my t zone
as needed throughout the day
then continually throughout my day
i got through my entire 8 hour day without having to touch up once
i usually finish my makeup around 7am everyday
i start to look a little dewy around 2-3pm
brow area began to highlight themselves only a few hours
i am usually an oily mess by early morning.
i usually put it on before my primer
even after a full day of classes on campus i was a lot less oily than normal
even during winter in pennsylvania
i don't need to blot for hours
then around 3pm i will blot
starts a little dry in the morning
then becomes oily by the afternoon
the oil would literally show up again 5 minutes later
lasts me through the rest of my day
i used it after a workout
is shiny before 8:00am
my t zone will starts to show some shine about 2-3 hours
that doesnt shift throughout the day
ill be good through out the day
this lasted my whole work day
refreshed after using this
i left it on for about 10 minutes at most
the oily feeling goes away within an hour or so
it lasts me all day
i don't recommend it for evening.
then follow up with this daily
every morning in the shower
i can go longer without blotting during the day.
use it in the morning to help wake my face up
the day it expires on the box it cam in
try to leave it on for 30 minutes or so
our skin was changed the next day
i left on for about 15 minutes
i wake up the next morning with smooth
love to use it before i have an event to go to or on date night
when i woke up this morning
i think starting with 10 minutes
the real results arrived the next morning
felt the next morning i love skin care
as i tried it the first time at the end of the day after washing
i leave on for 20 minutes
every time i wash it off
i love using this after washing my face before i go to bed
after 20 minutes i washed it off
i left it on for the full 20 minutes
i felt my skin is glowing in the morning after i used
completely ok at minute 5
use only once or twice a week apply at night you will be surprised
or the inconvenience of leaving your home
i leave it on for the full 20 minutes before bed.
in the morning my face is glowing
i can notice results in 24 hours
i left this on for 20 minutes
every time i use this my closes pimple comes up to a head
i noticed results since the first night i used it
next morning magic happens
woke up this morning with baby soft skin
i used it again today
i will buy this mask till the day i die.
i look forward to using this every week!
i fell asleep with the mask on overnight
i woke up to wash my face
as i've followed the instructions to use 1-2 a week
i used this for the first time today and wow!!!!
put this on after cleansing my face last night
left on for 20 minutes
mostly where i am dry
i left it on for the 20 minutes
looked amazing the next day
at first i used it with the free maricuja oil
i put it on over night
immediately after my first use
the next day i woke up with beautiful
tried it again today
on the day, i used as instructed.
let it stay for the prescribed 20 minutes before rinsing
suppose to use once weekly
when used in the morning before getting ready
the magic is the next morning.
i cannot explain when i cleanse the next morning
i did the mask at night
i woke up the next morning
when i woke up the following day
it stings for about 2 minutes upon application
used this mask last night
in the morning holy heck
the next morning my skin felt and looked amazing!
the morning after trying this
especially when i wake up the next day of ussage
it stays on all day
on my 3rd day using it
i wear it at night
every day when i wake up my face looks like it's glowing
in the morning after i've used it at night
i love it at night at well
i also use it as a night cream
applied it at night after cleansing
will use it at night for sure
end of day after washing off
since i've been applying this cream after my shower each day
as soon as i'm home from work
definitely not twice a day
i saw instant results the first night.
use it once before going to sleep
the results after just one night are great: smooth skin
it was not the refreshed from vacation look i was going for
used it last night on face
night the other two days only at night
i've used this almost every night with the u
it feels heavy for a minute
when i finish one i'm usually on to the next
more help with evening out the complexion
it stayed on all day
this doesn't pill up under my makeup when i use it in the morning
if i put it on at night after my serum i wake up glowing
the first time i used it in conjunction with my origins 10 minute mask
i woke up the next morning with such brighter
fresh the next morning
one day i had a lot to do around the house
then later in the morning i follow my regular routine
at nite i put it on after i wash my face
awhile later use my regular nite
i woke up the day after with smooth
makeup in the mornings
used it last night
when you put it on at night
just last week a woman i work with
i put it on one night right before i went to bed
when i woke up the next morning my skin felt amazing
great for nighttime use.
feels in the morning after use
not greasy, works well am and pm!
if i use it in the morning
i let it soak in for about 5 minutes before doing my makeup
it's also great at night.
i don't know if i'll use it in the day during the summer
i wake up in the morning
was nervous to go outside of my normal skin care routine
i applied it at night
i apply it mid-day just for a pick me up.
use it everyday in the morning
sometimes at night as well
dewy when i wear this until about noon
it almost wakes me up in the morning
wasn't in desperate need of a new day cream
i used this in the morning and tidal at night.
all in all, i think this is a hit for sunday.
this during the day
it lasted me for 2 weeks using it only in my nighttime routine before bed
i actually didn't break out at all since the first day i used it
just by using it at night it made a huge difference on how my makeup applied the next morning
it left my face feeling soft even in the morning after sleeping
tight throughout the day
my face was soft all day.
i love it in the mornings when i'm getting ready
in the mornings under makeup
i started out 3x a week until i got to using everything daily
also light weight at the same time
especially during the winter
soft ready for my night serum's
ready for make up after washing again the next morning
this is great for the morning just to get the oils from the night off without stripping my skin
it's been only 5 days i am using it at night
every morning i wake up with a smooth skin
i look forward to the end of the day when i get to go home
after i get home from work
get very dry during that season
i get more oily during the rest of the year :
the tatcha water cream during the day
worth every penny especially for us ladies in late 40' to early 50
i find it too heavy for day time wear in this miami weather
at night on top of a face oil its perfect
i used it both morning and night.
now live in the humid south
it was 90 degrees here yesterday
sometimes at night on top of a serum
i am maybe halfway through the 0
i usually put it on after i do a face mask or after i shower before i sleep
i am in my early 30s
the only time i am without it is when i am tight on funds
i decided to buy this from sephora on the latest rouge spring event
after the first night
after the second night
after applying this at night in the winter
i put it on at night
wake up with a calm
i woke up the next morning
i started using this at night only
oily at the same time
now use it morning
the next day too
i get compliments almost daily on my skin
i typically like to use this at night
sometimes got irritated after a whole makeup day especially in spring
use soft cream during the day
used it as night cream
i also started to use the creme at night
however that was too heavy for daytime use
i seriously got just the mini sample yesterday- used it before bedtime
my essence this morning
i first purchased this face cream my first winter back in chicago
i like to use this at night when i sleep
ive tried to stray because i use this twice a day morning
i love it at night as my second cleanser
my makeup now looks as fresh at the end of the day as it did when i first applied it
on a morning after enjoying a wee bit too much wine last night
not sleeping nearly enough
vibrant when i wake up
i also use it in the morning with my morning routine products
am finally seeing results
i am only using it once per day as i have a different pm regimen
during which time the weather was extremely dry
once in the morning
i just tried this today for day wear.
i started rotating nights with this serum
some people like to use it during the day
i only use it at night
i apply it at night, after cleaning my face.
i wake up in the morning
lightening after only a few nights
am seriously considering wearing this over my foundation on that day
so happy i found this before the summer heat comes around
i don't like wearing foundation in the summer
my makeup lasted all day with this
this is the last thing i put on my face before i leave for the day
honestly for the times it's saved my day/night
in the afternoon for touch ups
at night for the best results
i don't reach for this every day
i am also planning to use this over my moisturizer on a long haul flight
the shine that comes after midday is not noticed
it actually arrived at the perfect time because i had a few upcoming events that i had to attend
touch up throughout the day
especially after youve spent the day in make up
"go within every day
looking flawless in photos from morning right until night
i usually start my makeup routine around 5:30 am
i don’t come home till 11pm
i tried out this product after about 3 hours of wearing makeup
basically like nothing is on your skini apply it after my morning routine
on a good skin day
when i'm on the go after work
keeps me shine free for hours
my skin thanks me for it every day
i wake up the next morning
sunday riley sleeping oil when i want something just light
plump in the morning
by far my favourite night cream that i've used.
some evenings i skip the moisturizer as i find this is enough on its own
i've used this for 3 nights.
i put it on before going to bed
the next morning my face would be soft
when i woke up
you cannot use this during the day
i used it last night
woke up this morning with super soft skin
before i go to bed
i noticed results right away after the first night
i saw results following morning
when i woke up this morning i was amazed to see not one dry patch or flake on my skin
i added this to my routine last night
i wake up in the morning with glowy skin
after a week i guess my eyes
game changer to my nightly routine.
i keep it in my shower
when i use it the morning i don't need to put on the cologne
then layer this on at night
on days when it's especially humid out here in the northeast
i put this on after i get out of the shower in the morning
after just the first night i saw results
this one at night
another at night with their rose oil
a little comes back after hours
for my nightly routine
at night it is my final step
when i come home i wash
do my usual morning skin routine
i used this day
this is part of my am routine.
i will be using this till the end of time!
i alternate evenings with this
when i was checking out at sephora
i wear it alone at night
wake up to glowing skin in the morning
i tried this oil first last night.
pretty the next morning
one application in the morning
heavy that i can pile on other evening products as well
i also use it under my eyes in the morning
apply it every morning
the first night or two i did wake up with a little bit of a greasy feeling
it going on my h
night after washing my face
probably too heavy to use on the face in the day
great for the evening
night on my face
started using in the winter for dry skin on
when i wake up in the morning i really notice a difference
only used for two nights, but i really like it!
havnt used it during the day
i took a chance during the vib sale
when i wake up in the morning
as it is early in the season
my makeup breaks up after a few hours when i use this
there have been a few nights where this was the only thing i put on my face before bed
a must have for my daily routine.
this is my daily go to
i recently started using this as my night time moisturizer as well
in the past i've had to "double-up" on the moisture during canadian winter
i am up to using it almost every night
i might use a heavier cream at night in the winter
this one will be my year-round staple for mornings because of how fast it absorbs
i put it on every night!
i am at the point in my life where fine lines are starting to appear around my eyes
at night before bed only
am starting to see the beginning stages of fine lines in the crows feet area
after just one week of applying at night
have to be back up at 5 am
get ready for bed i put this cream on my eyes
bags when i get up the next morning
i may only be running on four hours of sleep
this is a decent day-to-day eye cream.
however, i will not use at night.
that was more awake
ready for the next meeting
is soothing for my tired eyes at the end of a long day in front of a computer
i look refreshed in the morning
look forward to using this eye cream each evening
above my eyes morning
i am just starting to see fine lines in the eye area
i am also just starting to battle dry skin.
easy to apply every morning
rub on each night before bed
once in the morning before i put on my makeup
once at night as a part of my nightly skincare ritual
even better i am seeing results after just 1 week
use this every morning!
it is really really hot in st louis during the summer
which i feel wakes up your skin in the morning
i'd have to blot every couple of hours
plan to use it every morning with my clarisonic
i can go through about 10 oil sheets a day.
i am hoping for continued results.
this entire line will be my go to for the hot summer months here in d
i will definitely purchase this after finishing my free tube
relaxed after a long day
when my face would normally be shiny by lunchtime
perfect for every day use
i like using it in the morning
even with the hot weather starting to peek again here in south florida
the cooling sensation wakes me up in the mornings
good for the mornings
fresh everyday that i don't ware makeup on several days of the week
i love using it in the morning because it instantly wakes me up
i love using it during the day after my work out
no more oil blotting all day even last through my workouts
after using for a week my skin felt refreshed
right before i go to bed
i stay matte throughout the day
i can even use it in the morning before my primer
to the point i have to use blotting papers every 2-3 hours
out of my car all day
to completely oily by noon
my skin still was oily by at least 3-5pm whereas i used to be able to go 6am-1am more than 12hours
i still have to use blotting sheets in the afternoon
this is such an amazing moisturizer that i use it in place of a primer on days when im extra rushed
follow up with this after morning
put it on my face after a shower on a day i planned on staying in
later on in the late afternoon i was pleasantly surprised/shocked when i realized how significantly less oily i looked compared to usual
i am all over it
my makeup would be destroyed by my oily skin within 3-5 hours after putting it on
i tend to apply this hydrator in the morning rather than at night
1-2 times a day which helps keep my skin balanced throughout the day
it was perfect under my makeup each morning
while wearing my foundation for at least 8-9 hours
only one week since i started using i can see big change on my face every morning
my skin is so soft after just one application at night
in the morning just before applying my makeup
it gives a really cooling sensation that wakes me up in the morning
it actually also helps hold makeup in place for a solid 5hrs
i find it perfect for day
like when you step outside on a winter morning
all day i'm oil free
before i go to sleep
leave for work immediately after washing my face
stays all day long/ i use it day
night on the daily
can be used morning and night
most nights it feels light which i love
i love using it at night because i wake up with the brightest
after shaking it every night before use
i look forward to opening a new one every week just
the fresh pressed powder as gratis last month
a perfect 7-day skin boost for before a big event
i put this on at night before bed like suggested
when i wake up
it works so well i can still feel the cream at work after washing my face in the morning
making it great for those rushed mornings in which i forget to use it
recommend waiting for about at least 10 minutes before putting makeup under eye
the day i turned 30
i only use it at night
both in the morning
in the evening they don't sting
adjust when i put it on in the morning
i am now in my mid 20's
once in the morning after the shower
right before bed after cleansing
i wake up at 3 or 4am everyday
water within minutes of putting this cream on
it lasted until the following morning
even after a long day at work
make stayed in place all day too.
will keep rocking it throughout the summer into fall
get ready at the gym
i wore this all day
it last me 8-10 hrs thru a normal work day
will be great in hot summer days.
stays on all day
i do start to get oily in my t-zone after a few hours
"every" night as an eye treatment
after about 7 days of using a small amount under my moisturizer at night
i typically use just after cleansing before bed.
i used it that night in my daily routine along with weekly exfoliater
this in the morning
the korres rose oil into my nightly routine
i took another comparison photo this morning
my skin feels super soft every morning when i wake up
put it on at night as well
whether i use in the morning
makeup looks great 12 hours later
or i wake with fresher
he uses this at night to help with the damage
perfect to use at night
love putting this on in the morning.
when i use at night
i used it at night
the next morning it did not leave any oil left
then stop for a few days just to observe your skin
i apply it after i get out of the shower
i begun a morning and night oil routine.
i personally use this every day in my morning routine
refreshing in the mornings
i got my first one in april during the 15% off sale
i love using this as my last step at night especially in the warmer months
when i apply this 2-3 times throughout the day
i would probably not use this one in the evenings
i also use it during the day
i put it on at night
i saw this at sephora last night
i applied this before bed
it is perfect for overnight
i used a few drops at night before going to sleep
after washing my face in the morning
i put it on at night
don't wash it off the next morning
feels in the morning after using it
leave it there for hours
after using this oil every night before bed for about 2 weeks my skin completely changed
all you need is a couple drops before/in your foundation or before bed
two drops at night
i first used it before bed since the box said i can use it in the morning or evening
evening right after washing my face
i wake up refreshed
instead i use it at night after i wash my face
its a must before makeup and before bed
i always wake up refreshed after using this
woke up the next morning
i put this on under my makeup in the morning
night as skin care
not to mention the spring glow i got going on.
after my typical routine
wow i noticed my foundations didn't last as long during the day
work 8 hours in an area with little to no ac
just starts my morning off right
when i wake up
before i go to sleep
it's the perfect first step to make up that will last all day
my makeup stays locked in place for hours
i wore my make up for five hours running around at work
it stays all day
went to sephora the other day
in the daytime before i put my makeup on
my makeup was still perfect at the end of the day
then my foundation stays on all day
i'd be looking dead as a zombie in the morning
by the end of the day
underneath my make up in the morning
before i go to bed at night
i work many hours a day.
i went 16 hours without a touch up my makeup.
hop into the shower at night to wash it off
feel refreshed in the morning
which is great right before bed
fresh after i use it
even if i forget to take my makeup off at night
just apply this in the morning
about a week after using it every night
this doesn't bother me because it will come off in the shower the next morning
use it at night as the first step in my double cleanse
eyes were irritated for an hour after use
as my first step of the double cleanse at night
can't wait till tonight to use it again!
the next day let it down
as the last step to my nightly routine
it can be used both morning and evening.
works well morning or night.
i used this for the very first time this morning
i actually use this morning
i did not expect to wake up with such soft skin the very next morning
after the 1st week
they only made my skin stay matte for an hour.
during the summer i usually break out constantly
i love wearing this during the summertime
i especially like to use it in the morning to give my skin a glow before putting on my make up for the day
for the brief time that its on your face
i began using this at night only
use it in the mornings leaving others mystified as to how i am keeping my skin so dewy
i just used this mask today
you leave it on for only 3 minutes
last night i was taking off my makeup
i just used it again tonight
i focused it on my nose tonight
after extracting everything i could after my first application tonight
this is my new 2x a week routine.
i used for the first time tonight.
i both tried this for the 1st time tonight
i scrubbed around in my t-zone for about 1-2 minutes then let it sit for about 8 minutes
leave it on for 5-10 minutes then rinse it off
i used this for the first time this morning
i am in my early 30s
with a night time moisturizer like origins nightamins the other few nights
i woke up this morning to much less redness on my face
i followed up with an old favorite for a night cream
woke up the next morning with glowing
i am usually good to go for the day
only use it at night
depending on if its night or day
my nighttime routine is the same up until the eye serum

i don't use this at night though
at night over tatcha essence
i only need to apply it each morning it last all day long
i apply this after my evening routine
waking up with soft
i recommend this mask as a weekly routine
i leave mine on for 20 minutes at a time
by the next morning the results are even better
this mask at the half-week mark
especially the next morning
in the mornings i love using this after the cleansing oil
leaving 1 less step in the morning
at least on my face
since introducing this serum into my morning routine
perfect for dry areas on face - lasted all day.
slap some on at night
rinse off next morning
so after a few hours of wear my high end foundation looks greasy
let it sit for a minute before putting on my moisturizer both am
i did this mask before bed
leave it on for about 1 hour
which lasts for another 3 nights
i left the mask on for about an hour
will purchase again for a special event or if my skin was breaking out
will probably add this to my nightly routine when they restock it near my store
i left it on for about 30 minutes
after 20 minutes of this mask
it will do the job during a bad breakout before an event
i used it yesterday
the morning after using this mask
used it as a mask on its own for 3 other nights
however i woke up this morning
although i am using the new line from sunday riley at the same time
used it at night before bed
i am writing my review on the day after wearing the mask
this is definetly to be used at night
i left the mask on for about a half hour
i felt like taking a nap in it
can't wait to use during the summer.
i will use time and time again !
portion of the mask in my refridgerator to chill for about 5-10 minutes ahead of time
i saw results the next day
i kept it on for 30 minutes.
i fell asleep shortly after
disappear by the morning
this will be my sunday night go-to!
healthier the next day
dewy for the rest of the week
i leave it on for 40 minutes
i got compliments the next morning.
i would recommend using it at the end of the day.
i used it last night
i did this after a hot shower
just relax with it
used it the next morning
was very cooling for the 45-60 minutes that i had it on
now the next day my skin was glowing
i didn't immediately see any hydration differences when i took it off after leaving it on for 40 minutes
i drank to nights in a row
so by the end of the 2nd night my face looked dehydrated
it stays in place!
the next morning i woke up glowy and smooth.
depending on if its night or day
my nighttime routine is the same up until the eye serum
just applied it tonight
the first time i put it on
during the summer here in fl while it's very hot
my skin is also less oily in the morning when i wake up
i slather it on before bed most nights a week
the tatcha water cream is amazing during the day
also alone at night when i skip it
perfect for the summer
back in the day
i am super oily during the summer
very cooling during the summer
i find that throughout the day my skin isn't as oily when i have this product on my face from the morning
i tried a cream before this with my routine
i put it on at night
i put it on around 10am
by 6pm i had no oil breaking through
then apply my make-up in the am
sometimes at night as the last step in my nighttime skincare routine
way less oil throughout the day
at the same time
i only use it daytime as i use the expensive stuff at night
i am only able to use it in the pm
in the morning, i towel it off my face.
i took pictures every 3 days
i only use this at night before bed
15 days of just pm use i can't believe the improvement
when i woke up the next morning
will it return to canadians at a later date?
it worked overnight too
the very next day i woke up
i got this in the sunday school set
i got the small version of this in the "sunday school" set
i first tried it today in store.
in the morning i follow this with ufo
in the evening i follow with luna
this is a permanent step in my nighttime routine now
most folks think i'm in my mid to late 20s when i'm almost 40
felt extremely refreshed for days afterward
doesn't leave me with a oily t-zone by midday
after a full week of using it every morning my skin does get a little dry
i've put it on before bed woke up a lot less oily
i only use it once a day despite washing my face twice a day
i wouldn't recommend it as an overnight routine though
this is going to continue to be my summer day/night cream
at the same time once on your face feels so light
then most recently i started to use it at night too
my skin feels great in the morning after putting in on before bed the night before
night as a final step
i started using it at night
in the morning i wake up with refreshed skin- this is even during that time of the month where i usually experience difficult hormonal acne
i can literally see a difference in the morning when i wake up each day
in the day time
i can use this oil morning
i tried it on it’s own overnight
i put it on every night during my skincare routine
after i change my routine
left it on for 5 minutes
i definitely will be adding this into my weekly routine
i can use it in the morning
i am in my late 20s
it's great as a morning wake-up wash
a little water at the end will finish the job.
i mainly use this in the morning time since i'm also a stomach sleeper
great for night treatment though!
fun little treatment to use once a week.
when i wake up in the morning
alll in less than a month of using 1 drop under both eyes morning
even in the dead of winter.

i got this yesterday
later that night i went to use it with the rest of my products
i apply to my whole eye area morning
i love this "mask" in the morning.

right before i go to bed
i like to use it as an overnight mask
in the sun and weather.

when i washed my face in the morning i could feel the product resurface
the product stays on all night even when i slept face-first on my pillow
when i woke up in the morning my skin was glowing
or at least thinking about it every night
the serum in the mornings because i forget to wash my face at night
in both the morning
brighter the next day

not expecting overnight results
night every single day for a week
could relax enough to nap

flat skin where i had breakouts just the night before
s in the morning
leave that on for 3-4 minutes
that i use only at night
it goes on in the morning after i wash my face.
i just apply it before drying my hair in the morning or put it on 10 min before bed
not greasy at all and can wear day and night.
in the am i use an aveeno mosturizer
i am using it only at night before the hope in a jar cream at night
i am beginning to notice that my skin tone is evening itself out
you will see the results overnight!
evening on my post-60 skin

i put this on at night right before i use my night cream
i applied it to my face morning
night for a few days before my moisturizer
then again this morning
this is great morning
put in on my face every morning before my moisturizer
take under 30 mins to get ready in the morning
yet i can use it in the morning before primer
may have to wait till my birthday since $96 is a bit much
how soft it is every night before bed
've used it during the daytime as well
i love putting it on right before bed
i noticed a difference the next morning
especially in the winter
i washed it off in the morning
i store it in the fridge during the summer for a chilly night time refresh
this is the first time i ever use a sleeping mask
right before heading to bed
after about a week of using it at night
my combination skin is living when i apply this before bedtime
bouncy in the morning
love to put this on at night!
after a long day at the beach or full face of makeup
left it on overnight to wake up to a glowing face
when i woke up
my face feels so soft in the morning when i wake up
plump in the morning
this overnight sleeping mask is easy to apply.
plump the next day
i added this to my night time skin care routine
you're only supposed to use it a few nights a week
if you're about to get less than 6 hours of sleep
not just for night, i use it all the time.
i put before go to bed
before i put make up in the morning
leaving it on overnight
i like to wear this at night
can keep hydrating until next morning if apply before sleep
almost the same effect as overnight
not only do i put this on before bed
i wear it throughout the day as well
usually i wake up with my mouth feeling gross from the balm i put on at night
every night before going to bed
to the point where i can't sleep through the night without reapplying aquaphor
i just got this product yesterday
not only slept through the night without my lips drying out
putting this on at night
it's a must have step in my night face routine.
it lasts well through the night
cushy in the morning
on my first use
which i am fine with
used it last night
i am never sleeping without this stuff
stayed on all night
after sleeping with it on all night
the first time i used it i woke up
when this gem first arrived i couldn't wait until bed time to use it
apply this at night
i also use a little bit it in the morning after i wash my face
in 12 hrs i woke up
last night i put a nice layer on
i say improvements after one night
also dab on a little in the morning when doing my routine
in the morning before putting on my makeup
it stays on even after consuming beverages or late night refrigerator attacks for ice cream
even after only the first night of use
i could put this on before bed
it sticks around for hours
wake up with product still on
the first night that i used it
when i put it on at night
the next morning my lips felt
also a thin layer in the morning before i leave for work
i wear it all the time not just at night!
i've never found a night balm that stayed on
the first time i used this i woke up
throughout the day as well
twice before bed as a mask
it stays on through the night
i put this on every night before i go to bed
as a final step in my nightly skin care routine this the perfect finish
i sleep with it on
only used it at night
it's so lightweight yet its still there when i wake up in the morning
i put it on before bed
you put it on at night
your lips will be transformed by next morning
i put it on overnight
to reapply in the middle of the night
this mask lasts the whole night
even on the nights i apply too much
are dried up esp when i wake up because of the night
this literally stayed on all night
it can be used day or night
i really like the way my lips in the next morning
even before a morning run
i put it on at night
put this on every night before bed.
when you put it on before you go to bed your lips feel so amazing the next morning
i slather it on at night
use a little less in the morning
full in the morning when i woke up
i get compliments on my skin every single day
put this on at night
even though i apply it every night
am buying another jar as i want to keep one at my desk to use while i work
until i found this!
luscious looking again in a week of sleeping with it every night
there is no residue next morning
this one stayed on all through the night.
the product appears balmy at first
it is perfect for night time use
i tried it first in the morning
i put it on at night
wake up in the morning with super soft skin
i do think it is a little too heavy to put on in the mornings before my makeup
find it best to apply this after my nightly skin care routine
throughout the next day
i would either use it at night or on a no-makeup day
you can put in on at night or al
n the morning before you do your makeup
i apply this product in the morning
when i go to sleep
i like to go pretty natural during the day in the summer time
my favorite part about this cream is that i can apply it after washing my face in the morning
i'd be happy to leave this sitting out in my bathroom or my makeup area
use it before bed
definitely will be a staple in my night routine
i always use this right before bed
only as an overnight treatment
i would recommend using this at night
already on the third day of using it alone in the nights i could see difference in the hydration of my skin
very interested to try it out during cold months cause it a little bit heavy for everyday usage during summer
looking fresh all day
i put it on before i go to bed
will become a regular part of my night time routine
refreshed after long days in the sun
i put it on once a day in the morning

one at night before bed
again before makeup the next day
found it to works better for me during the day
i wear it in the mornings and before bed.
feels more smooth when i use this the night before
i love it in the morning on its own
at night with a heavier cream on top
depending on if its night or day
my nighttime routine is the same up until the eye serum
the results i see when i wash it off
i am on my second try
after 4 applications using every 2-3 nights
the next morning waking up
each time i am left with smooth
continues to feel smooth even after a nights sleep
i used it for 2 nights in a row after my derma roller
pretty when i wake up

i didn't even have to use my night cream
i will use this a lot in my ritual.
even after many a beach day
i love wearing this when i know i am going to be hanging out by the pool or at the beach because 1
i used it this morning
i am always in a rush in the morning to get to work
most mornings i just use this product
it lasts all day
when i am in a rush
i do 1 treatment a week
this product has quickly become great from mornings
i get on average 4-5 hours of sleep
dark circles because i have a horrible sleep schedule
i used this at night with my normal skin care routine
i only use this serum at nights because of how shinny i looked after application
in the morning my skin looked refreshed
on the third day of using this product the next day after waking up i noticed a huge difference in my face it was glowing
dry at the same time
especially when used at night

i used it before bed after i washed my face.
i used it every night before going to bed

i used this serum every night for a week.
as someone in their late 20s
the first day i used it
i put it on in the morning
it was a little heavy for day time
at the end of the week
today i finish my free 7-day treatment of dual serum the next generation that influenster's sent me
i used it after i washed my face before going to bed
i used it at night
after i used the first night my skin felt great the next morning
even after the first night i could tell my skin was smoother in the morning
first i would like to start by saying i received this 7 day trial completely free on influenster
i applied it every night before bed after my face was completely clean
i applied this at night before bed instead of my usual night cream
the first day i used this
the pore clogging didn't happen on the first day
the second day i applied
after the 3rd day however
i applied it in the evening after my shower
not greasy to have on at night
i applied it every night after cleansing
over the course of 7 days i did notice my skin tone evening
i would wake up the next morning to find my face more radiant
even if i only got 5 hours of sleep
thanks to influenser i got a free week trial.
i've just finished my 7th day
the first day i used it at night right before bed
i then tried it the next morning
i waited 30 minutes before applying my makeup
i kept using it every morning after that in place of my moisturize
i applied every night for u days.
in fact, today is my 7th day.
its amazin i saw results in three days
looked better in the morning after using this at night
i apply it at night
when i wake up

and by day 7 i had all of that and a glow.
i normally use an oil at the end of my nightly regimen
use another eyecream at night
imagine my surprise watching my skin transform with each days use
i held algenist to their 10 day result
i put this on 3 times a day
i used this once at night
next morning they weren't as red
of course i left my murad spot treatment at home
i apply this throughout the day
before i went to sleep i looked in the mirror
i apply it at night
i swear i wake up the next morning to not a zit
i put it on throughout the day
the spot treatment showed results the same day i tried it
it only sits on your face for three minutes.
first i massage it into my skin with no water for thirty seconds to a minute
will give this a 4 starts
leaves my face matte for at least 6 hours
you leave this on for about 5 minutes
when i woke up the next day
when i wake up in the morning my skin looks br
new after using it the night before
i am bad about taking my makeup off at night
use this mask after i get out of the shower in the morning
while i am getting ready
my face is clear, fresh and ready for the day.
i do it before bed

without having to leave it on overnight
i notice that when i use it in the morning
i am shine-free all day

i applied this for the first time at night time before bed
even after a full nights sleep with drool.
i now use it every morning and night!
under a heavier cream at night
when i wake up in the morning
after i shower before bed
which i'm not used to when it comes to a pm eye cream
i mostly use it at night
this week so check em'
i love that it can be used at night or in the day before applying your eye makeup as a base
that means i'm up all night with the baby
wake up at the crack of dawn with both kids
i never really thought of using one in the day time until i saw a woman on their instagram use it before makeup
depuffs my undereyes in the morning
i think this is best used in the morning as i always wake up with puffy eye bags
when used in the am
i apply it am & pm.
at night after i showered
i intend to use it tonight before bed
it also pairs amazingly well with the midnight recovery concentrate
i put this on just about every night all year long
i swear by the midnight recovery concentrate
as well as the rest of the midnight recovery line
the next morning i wake it
a great one to use on the nights you go to bed late
i apply this about 3-4 times a week right before i got to bed
i wear this year round
i will use abbot of this before bed the night before an event
it repairs my skin at night time to leave a smoother
healthier skin on my face when i wake up in the next morning
midnight recovery oil is my go to oil!!
gets me ready for bed
glowy the next morning
way my undereyes look the next morning
i now use this eye cream at night

every day in between

i ran out of sunscreen shortly thereafter
used the cream before i went to the beach
great to get oil off your face every morning
it says to leave on for 5-10 minutes
the midnight recovery eye cream

it still isn't empty even after using it every single night
i will never use another night eye cream!
only get between 4-5 hours of sleep
i'll be using every other night
while using in the shower
the best pairing with this is their midnight recovery concentrate too
i leave it on for about 8 minutes
by morning it feels fresh
however when i got up in the morning
when you are asleep
then applied this gel as a part of my night routine
slept on this one
woke up the next morning
i finally decided to use this night gel last night
this morning my skin was so clear

i've used it every night since then
almost every morning i would wake up with smoother
evening out the skin tone
the first night i used this
usually i apply it at night

i wake up with such refreshed face
since this is a night treatment
aside from that it does wonder to my skin just over night every night
as i continued a regular use schedule i noticed that my face became very agitated

even after the first night of use
i started using it every night

warm weather has hit where i live
in the morning i only use 1 pump.
this will be a part of my daily routine from now on
after using it for a while in a regular routine
when i wake up
before i go to bed
i look forward to washing my face in the shower each morning
it refreshes me with the orange smell when i wake in the morning

i love using this in the morning before.
which is nice after a morning workout

i don't know what was going on with my skin during the month of january
my face isn't shiny into the late afternoon anymore
it lasts all day
getting greasy looking during the day
within 30 minutes to an hour after my routine my face would be glistening around my forehead
while still being mattifying enough to keep my skin nice during summer runs or just a normal day at the office
when i wake up
especially in the winter
ing hold out throughout the day
i put it on every night
which is why i put it on at night
not during the morning
overall it's worth the little bit of shine i get in the afternoon
the first day i used it
within the 3rd day
once i changed up my night routine
just used this at night
i love when i put it on in the morning
i glow after putting it on!
would be shiny in the afternoon
which i used day
i find myself powdering my face only a few times a day now rather than every hour
i am on my third or fourth jar
i i use it at night only
great in the morning or before bed
i took it home and that night used it.

then miracles the next day
i just started using the ole hendriksen night gel at night

i decided to try it with my am routine

i only wear it at night since it does take a while to absorb
i actually can't wait to wash my face at night
i will never again go to sleep with out it
i started using it only at night
much cheaper than the 3 1/2 hour drive to la from where i live
the next morning it's like i never had a face-ripping allergy attack the day before
i would use this at night only.
i always use it at night
dry every minute until this product
within half an hour after applying any of them my skin was peeling again
i applyed everyday in the morning
every time i put it on
hot during the summer it will come in real h
i went on a moisturizer hunt during the dry winter months
at night i slowly massage it into my skin until it is almost absorbed
was pleasantly surprised when the first morning
after using it the night before
the effect of the cream lasts all the next day
in the winter, i use it morning and night.
i look forward to washing my face every night
at the same time
t is now a staple for my daily routine

together with my calrins night cream
smooth the next morning
don't use the cream on my nose every night
great product if you're in your mid to late twenties or early to mid thirties
acne scars- i use this product 2-3 times a week because every night was too much for me at this point
this night cream does it all!
my skin did dry up a little bit during the first week
this is for night only!
at first my skin was a little irritated the first week or so

one in the shower
i live in the south where it is always muggy
is mild enough to use in the morning
i don't come home at the end of the day with an oily face

i will save this for my days off
i tried one day with it
i typically apply it after i wash my face in the morning
as well as full coverage on the weekends
although i still have to blot throughout the day
actually lasts the entire day
an hour after i wash my face i fill up four blotting sheets of any br
there was no point in time during the 18 hours before i washed my face off that i felt greasy or needed to blot
i did blot just to see at the end of the night one night
i used it for the first time tonight after the mud mask

even after a tough day
and, i just happened to be shopping that day.
she made my day :

i really love that it wakes my face up in the morning

it was over 100f that day
i am in the sun 8 hours a day
not just for after sun
i went into my local sephora store earlier today.
the sun is very strong during the day time so this item is really needed during the night
my burn felt ten times better the next morning
i slathered this on before i went to bed
i tried it in winter
when i had a cold

after i take it off in the evening
this one at night
around that time of the month i use it in the morning
i put this cooling gel on right when i got home that night

was in such a hurry this morning that i didn't put on moisturizer
soft throughout the entire day

as soon as i run out of my current night cream
when i come out of the shower

part of the reason i love washing my face in the morning
at night is because after

my philosophy one in the morning for a gentle wash
i wear on the shower or in the morning when i first wash my face
i originally received this eye treatment as a gift at the saks in nyc when i was there buying last-minute night cream
so this container will last me a longgggg time
the next morning when i wake up
somewhere between a week or two into using it i woke up one morning
i think it helps my fine lines stay away during the day
i wear this during day time.
on a good day i look like your average slightly tired student
i might not look like i got 10 hours of sleep

even after i wash everything off at night
was able to apply make-up with-in 3 minutes
for someone who needs to wear at least a 30 spf every day
before this i usually used their aqua
this is better than my prescription stuff my skin was flawless after my 12 hour shift
i tried it during the day
i'll stick to it for my night cream!
now he puts it on every day
especially after a long day at work he comes home washes his face
which also makes it easier for him to shave in the mornings
use it every night before bed.
placed my night look
i am as excited about removing my makeup as i am about putting it on every morning
this has became a main product of my nightly routine after wearing a think amount of make up for the day
on nights when i work late i like to put this on
have really been loving this to take off my makeup at the end of the day
my only struggle is if i use this after a night of drinking
it is also relaxing after a rough day!
i never leave home in the morning without using this eye cream
gave it a try on vacation
i will still use my beloved fca at night
which is fine for the day
i am on my second go round with it
this is my new morning eye cream
with this stuff under my eyes in the morning
was not at all surprised when this eye cream helped me look refreshed in the morning
at night i use shieshedo
i am in my early 30's
i wear this every day, all year round.
start using this now girls
nothing with spf is made for evening.
have a habit of washing my face 3-4 times a day
especially on days when i workout in the morning
i wash my face twice a day
which only stays on the face for a minute or less
after a makeup wipe in the evenings
going into the fall/winter
also that i feel clean hours after using it
i would use it as my everyday morning
if i get sweaty in the afternoon or something
it takes just a few minutes to be ready for bed.
i like to wash my face twice a day
on days where i do outdoor activities i use 2 pumps
so at night i lather my face
get cloudy inside after 2 months of use
this is perfect for morning
i feel it's a great morning routine to freshen
been using this for yearsi use it in the mornings
favorite morning face wash.
both in the morning
like during the winter
i only use this product on those days in the shower at night
after 12 hours i had hardly any oil on my t-zone area
leave you fresh after the use
dry at the same time
a different one for my pores at night
this is my every day face wash for about a year now
it was effective at cleaning my face at the end of each day
soft i try to use it at least once a day at least before i put on my makeup in the morning
is perfect for my t-zone to clean every day
not i order it 2-3 bottles at a time
this face wash is great for once a day after activity
i love it in the morning or at night to take off my makeup
i look forward to putting it on my face every morning
holds my makeup in place into the wee hours of the morning
oily during the day
i let it sit for a couple minutes to set before i my apply foundation
the true test will be in the dead of summer.
this was the only change i made to my morning routine
glow to see me through the day
the first day i used this product i noticed by the end of the night my face still wasn't oily
depending on what season it is
also well into the night
on saturday went ahead
my foundation stays on for about 6 hours before i have to blot when i use this primer
i can go hours with this before i need to blot.
it lasts through the day
it was a good 6 hours before i finally saw my face start to "patch" that's a big difference between 1-2 hours
it stays all day
after 10 hours of running around at work
i'll leave for work in the morning
though the smell does go away shortly after application
5 hrs before i had to use my blotting sheets
i can go up to 6 hrs without blotting
i also like that after a day at work
makes my makeup last all day 13+ hours
keep in mind i'm posting this in the winter
ready for the day
used it every day
the first time i put it on.
8 hours after i put it on
use it about every 3 nights
i only use it at night
at the end of the long work day
i only use it at night
use it morning too
it takes at least two minutes to pump this lotion
but literally lasts all day.
i will update in 30 days
this is best used in the morning
i decided to pick this up for the winter
the minute you pour it into your h
its a product i use daily every night
i look forward to washing my face nightly
another lancome product i use on my lazy days.
am just about to run out
usually at night with the korres wild rose sleeping mask
under the sleeping peel at night
the next day i wake up
only use it at night
i mostly used it for nighttime
i love using it in the morning to get a lovely kick-start to the day
i am in my early 30's.
i follow this with the overnight mask
i put it on at night after cleansing.
after letting it soak in for half hour
my skin is dry year-round
before my night cream
during the day it's hydrating enough on its own
this serum i use at night all over my eyes
plump in the morning
except i skipped 1 night when i used the korres sleeping facial
after every time i washed my face
after the first night
so our heat is coming on every 15-20 minutes
last night on my face
i also use the wild rose 24-hour mousturizing
wash with warm water a 2nd time during the day
i dabbed this on at night before bed along with the 24 hour cream
use this every day
this is my 6th day using this serum followed by the 24hour wild rose moisturizer
it's not needed when i use this on my face during the day
i start my morning by washing my face
every morning i get up
started using this product only in the mornings before my make up
usually in the evenings
i simply put on the serum every night
for like the 1st time in my life
i am in my early 30s
etc i'll use it at night too
i used this during the day at first
so i just alternate them at night.
i've found my new daytime
followed by the wild rose 24-hour moisture
i put it on in the morning
sat at an outdoor table in full sun at high noon with no sunburn or tanning
it is a bit heavy for summer
especially in the winter
i apply it to my face everyday in the morning before i head out
at the end of the day
i wear it every day under the foundation
makeup does slide off after a few hours
i am almost out
i love this for a foggy day
with some powder over the top it works for a sunny day as well
i can feel the difference in face for hours after i use it
i am extremely greasy an hour after applying
keeps me matte for at least half the day
i loved washing my face in the morning
night treatement for just $55
i can apply my foundation in minutes
same goes for the night creme from this line.
at the same time
i absolutely love putting this on every morning
alternating doing one in the morning
the other one at night
within 1 hour my face is shiny
only use it at night
i quickly started using it both in the evening
in the morning under my makeup
i wake up with very clear skin after my nightly application
will start to break out if i miss a morning
this product makes it disappear i swear within the same day or the next day
used this on them when i went to bed for the past 2 nights
i'll probably wait until i finish this
i only use it in winter as a night cream
i am a little disappointed that the spf is only 15 when doctors recommend 25 to 30 for daytime
was also helpful in evening out my skin tone
my skin looks as dewy at night as it did in the day
i am not sure i would need this in the summer or early fall when it is dry here
at the same time algenist cream
right now i use algenist as an everyday night cream
in the end they recommended the absolue day
comfortable after they put on the day ceam
as soon as i put this cream on
i am very happy to report that i love waking up in the morning to smooth
every time i use this
that is using it every day
look forward to putting it on at the end of a long work day
just right for night time
due to inclement weather which made it unsafe to drive home
i am kicking myself as i wait for the new bottle to be delivered
this product is called "take off the day"
i am on my second bottle already.
i am in my early 40's
less oily during the remainder of the day
i wear this if i'm only outside during my commute or if i'm going for a walk in the sun
love to wear it for day time
first night wearing the cream
next morning my akin its feels smooth
i work nights so my previous combination skin is now dry most of the time
i wake in the morning looking rested
use it only at night
plump in the mornings since using this
found this overnight cream to be just the ticket
when i wake up
fresh in the morning
smooth in the morning
also light at the same time
nice i use both during the day
use it as my day cream as well as at night
i opened the jar at night
some days i use it in the morning too
this cream is the last thing i put on every night
i used it just 2 nights
feels great in the mornings
at first this night cream seemed like it would be too heavy for my skin
skin feels the difference the next morning
love putting this on in the evening
it gives me good protection during night time.
i pair this with the benefiance eye cream at night
a nice mid-heavy night cream.
i just recently tried the night cream
when i wake in the morning it looks as though i've had a great nights sleep
i love this cream - i use it for day and night.
in the morning you wakr up refreshed
i put it on only at night
when i wake up in the morning my face just looks radiant
this is one of the best night cream .
i decided to try the benefiance night cream
totally recommending it again to people in late 20s
does get greasy sometime after putting on
i started using this for day-wear.
still on your face in the morning
i live in a dry and windy area.
i used it at night.
then i re-apply it at nite
wake up with nice soft baby skin in the morning
works great at night or even during the day!
i feel like i wake up with beautifully hyrdrated skin when i put this on before bed
some days you need that before bed
just in the winter when i was younger
i jumped on sephora that morning
my skin was extremely dry upon return from my vacation
windy seattle weather in just a couple of days
when i get up in the morning
my makeup lasts better during the day
when i wake up on the next day
i love the light smell on my skin before i hit the bed
at the same time
am going to use it in the winter
this is my normal night cream.
or as a night cream before bed
this is night two.
followed by nights that i just apply a serum
with the addition of night cream
it's the last product i put on before going to bed
the glow stays with me through the night
i needed to put something on at night
return to this one again
only use it as a night treatment
at night after cleansing
the effect lasts all day
i smooth the lotion on at night before going to bed
i wake up in the morning with a very refreshed look on my skin
i've used it for daytime under my foundation as well
tight in every morning
wouldn't use it in the daytime
a could feel the hydration start to fix my last few sleepless nights
i do put this on at bed
i enjoy the luxe treat before turning in at night
i only use it at night.
wake up in the morning with soft
again in the morning after washing my face
annoying when you're rushed in the morning
i do use this religiously every single night
love it and use it every evening.
after about a week of use at night i noticed i looked much more awake
i still only use it at night
a little in the morning before i put on my makeup
it even takes away the puffyness in the morning
the next morning i saw results
as i use a different cream during the day this will last me
you could wear in the day
my eyes look well-rested in the morning
i love it for night--it stays on
it makes me look refreshed in the morning
i do love this eye lotion for wearing around the house or night time
this is an overnight miracle to me
works very well as part of an evening routine
to heavy for my oily eye area to have on during the day time
you could get away with this during the day
i only use it at night
great for day or night.
used it once a day right before going to bed.
i apply this product every morning
i saw hydration results the very next day!
after i wash my face before bed
i apply this at night
in the morning i use very little
it doesnt take away dark circles from a late night or lack of sleep
i usually apply it 30 minutes or so before bed
am too tired to do the whole cleansing routine in the am
it's perfect for those late nights or nights where you get in bed
i follow it up by my nighttime routine without getting out of bed
we did not have water for the afternoon
in the summer time when it is extremely hot outside
these sheets are great for when you're on the go or exhausted from a night out
i found them especially helpful in that grueling first month with my newborn
as a get well gift for anyone on bed rest
perfect for the finals week.
some mornings i come home
one day in my usual sephora spree i decided "why not
they are great for before washing the face or post workout
y at getting my day face off
these are great for camping or for those nights i'm too tired to go through my whole cleansing routine
like after a late night
or after the beach
i've also used it to freshen my face on a hot summer day when i wasn't wearing any make-up
they are great for changing make-up when going from office to evening
great for quick cleaning after working all night before hitting the bed
cleanse properly like when on the road or traveling
use them after the gym
i keep these in my bedside table for when i'm too lazy to go
wash my face at night
after a long day at work
while camping this summer
i used them to just "wash" my face in the morning
i apply every morning before my makeup routine
after i put it on at night
which gets super humid during the summer
use it in the morning
it helps keep the shine under control during the day
use something oil-free with hyluaronic acid instead at night
i apply in the mornings and at night.
my t-zone became shiny within the hour.
after i cleanse my face in the morning i put this bad boy on
i used this daily in the summer
at the end of the day
i spend less at kiehl's for the cream
t lasts for a while even with me using it morning
use it in the morning apply after the toner
once usually in the middle of my day
shiny within an hour after putting make up on
i only have to blot maybe once during the day
i decided to try it before i go to bed
which never fails every time i put moisturizers at night
just put about a quarter-sized amount of this on my face each night before bed
in the summer it gets worse
it will not stop you from getting shiny later on in the day
notice some oil at the end of the day
also perfect for day.
once-a-day in the evenings on my oily skin
overnight the results were amazing
shine-free effect lasts about 2 hours only :( .
keeps my face throughout the day
i am now on my second bottle of this cream.
in the summer/fall months when it's still humid
use them late afternoon
a bit oily at the t-zone during summer
i used this as a day cream during summer
took at least a minute or so for the product completely dry on my face
before i go to bed
since i use it before going to sleep
it's the second time that i ordered this cream
once we were at the airport
i've used this after being out in the sun
i wear it in the am as well as in the evening before i hit the bed
it doesn't make my face shiny after a few hours
a bad day at the end
i put it on every morning after washing my face
after 3 hrs it goes away
this is a great evening mosturizer.
also works great during the day
only use it at night
use it every night
i find it takes about 3 minutes to absorb.
this is my every night cream
yet after using this product as a night cream it's like they disappeared overnight
i put it on at night
wash right off in the morning leaving my skin dry even with day cream
irritation in like an hour
especially great during cold weather months.
when i wake up in the morning my face is so smooth
i put this on after washing my face before bed
rejuvenated the next morning
if you put it on an hour before applying makeup it could probably be used for day
i started using this cream since my early 20s
chest the next morning
in the hot weather i use every other night or every third night
continues to perform with my ski after 3 years of use
i am ready to go
i can't wait to update my review in a week or so
it's the perfect cream for night or day.
was instantly hooked after only 1 night of usage
day -- in summer it will probably b/come a nightcream for me
now in my late 50s
after waking up the next morning my complexion looks brighter
i wear it night and day.
love it as my night cream
i put in on in the morning
best for use at night while you are sleeping
if you use it during the day under your eyes
even look when i'd awake in the morning
once the winter weather came out
i started using this in the daytime too
light at the same time
it seemed like my face was pretty shiny by the afternoon
after using nightly for a week
its great as a night cream
i only use it as night cream though.
i am still on the first jar.
this product is a regular in my routine.
get excited to wake up/go to bed to use this product
it's five years that i use this foam to clean my face in the mornings
most nights since i know i missed some nights
about to apply my daily routine skin care
ie in the morning
i wash my face twice a day
it wasn't until a couple weeks after my purchase that i noticed it was starting to dry out my combo skin
every morning i wash my face
once a week works perfect on my face
i am on my second bottle of this
my only issue with it is it starts to feel sticky after several hours of wear
got a little in my eye this morning
i am in my early 30's
using it in the morning
this is the 3rd day i've used it
until i wash it off
i apply it every morning before leaving the house
but i use this everyday once a day.
really works at evening out my skin tone
never go to bed without my shiseido, period.
this moisurizer is best for me to use at night.
my skin looks better after about a week of regular use
5 hrs before i go to bed or else this stuff would get on my pillows
but i used this as both a day and night cream.
after using it in the morning
when i wake up
i didn't put on my sunscreen for a month during the summer
i been using it since late august
the cream is great for day or night
its a little too thick for me during the day
even if i use it hours before i put my contacts in
after using the product once at night
totally wakes up tired eyes in the morning
i see results minutes when i apply it.
if you put it in the morning
at night i sweep it under my eyes
great for night use
in the morning under my makeup
the regular all about eyes in the mornings
for the first time in my 27 years i finally found a moisturizer that i don't dread using
it feels great going on my skin either in the morning or at night
i work 12 hour night shifts
before i go to bed
when i wake up
i started using it in my daily routine
the second i use this again i notice instant results
especially in the winter
i only use this at night
omg just after 4 nights using it
my skin also get less oily at the end of the day since i started using this product
this is good for a second cleanse after i take my make-up off at night or in the morning to wash off all my treatments from overnight
overnight results with this
i could see a difference in my skin the very next morning
i'd like to go through an entire hormonal cycle to see how my skin is next month
i normally use every night
in the mornings as a pick-me-up
i love using this at the end of the day to clean up my face
in the evening i follow up with a clearasil medicated pad
the moment i stop using this
my go to face wash in the am!
mostly use it in the morning or as a second step of my evening double cleanse
i guess in the evenings i won`t need a night cream because this doesn`t dry your skin at all
second cleanse in the evening
leaving it on your face for a minute to allow it to work its magic
i let it soak in for a minute
after i wash my face in the morning
then a last time right before i go to bed
use it to wash my face every morning
i follow up in the morning with the evercalm global protection day cream
will say that i double cleanse when i have a heavy make-up day
this is the best night cream i ever tried.
i survived a windy winter day of holiday shopping
for me personally it just seems like a cleanser i'd use in the evening before applying night cream rather than something i'd use in the shower in the morning to feel clean
also the night cream
i tried this last fall/winter with wonderful results
i am back for more
i look forward to washing my face at night with this
now, i look forward to washing my face each day!
i am in my early 40's.
i used it at night as well as during the day.
working early in the morning
i put this on before i go to bed every night.
even if i stayed all night studying
again at midday to refresh
especially in my morning classes
i only use it in the morning
obviously lose quite a bit of sleep during the year
20 minutes after i put it on
after using this for one night
this night cream has become one of my fav's.
this is my first ever night cream.
first time using a night cream
night that lasts through the morning
i really look forward to putting this on at night
i am on my second bottle of this wonderful night cream
by far my best night treatment
this is my new go to night cream
the cream goes on a bit heavy at first
because i live for this night cream
such a fantastic feeling to wake up with in the morning
i woke up in the morning with skin felt like silk
this is my all time favorite night cream
i wanted to spend slightly less than my previous night cream
bliss' night cream actually made my skin glow in the morning
finally found the perfect night cream.
i even use it in the day time.
i wake up every morning looking refreshed
at the same time
this night time cream is amazing.
i always tried other new night cream
so far every night i've looked forward to using this cream
i've finally found my perfect night cream!
the skin is relaxed when you wake up in the morning
after a night of sleep with the heat on
which is fine in winter
one morning after glam up my face
every morning after using it i wake up with smoother
i apply this before i go to bed
i like waking up
when i use it at night
i always wake up the next morning with brighter
with this night cream
which i actually use during the day too
i can pat my face later in the day
i used this at night
during the day on some dry patches of skin that i had
even in the middle of the night if i wake up
in the morning though
also like it for daytime
i prefer this to their day cream for winter.
even at night after putting it on
this cream starts to relax me as soon as i massage it into my face
clean in the morning without any bad reactions
it's the best thing in my night time ritual!
dry at the same time
this is the best night cream i've ever used.
rejuvinated from the time i put it on into the morning
i always put on at night before bed
notice my skin is just baby soft in the morning after i wash my face
until i started using this cream
finally a night cream that delivers!
so when i pick a night cream
forgot to pack a day cream so ended up using this twice a day
i didn't pack a day cream so every night
my skin is very hydrated in the mornings after lavishing this on the night before
when i run out of my current night cream
i am in love with this night cream for several reasons
soft both after applying it at night
waking up in the morning
this is my 2nd day using it
skin looks rested in the morning
i even use it under my eyes during daytime.
and i find that last until i wash my face again.
results better same day
next day pores look about the same
yet at the same time it gets greasy on a daily basis
the first time i put it on
when i use it at night i look bright
fresh the next morning
i left it on for 10-15 minutes
my face is no longer oily when i wake up in the morning
at the same time
i started using this product around the end of october
leave it on for 2 minutes before rinsing
she's washes at night before bed and that's it.
i started using it once at night
am going to go back to using it once a day
this is the best ance product i've ever used i use it every morning

i only use at night
for 2 weeks during the end of the month my chin area gets lit up
ful of reviews i went in the next morning
used it that night
the next night they were gone
while in sephora one day
i leave it on for like 5 min or more most of the time
i started using this product ever other night
i only use the full on mask once a week
on my third day
this is my at least 4 or 5th bottle.
i leave it on all night
after only one night
use this at night in areas where i'm prone to break outs
i literary put it on at night at by morning my zit
i went to sephora on a saturday evening
by tuesday morning i had no new breakouts
mainly use it at night when i have more time to wait around
flat by the morning
clearing everything just enough for me to look good on my prom night
can use this morning
perfect for daytime under makeup or nighttime
i apply them at night before i go to sleep
by the time i wake up in the morning
i now only use it at night
i usually only use it at night
since my late teens
used it every day
when i use it in the mornings
my skin was moistured all day
or leaving me oily an hour later
i feel refreshed every time i use it.
after using this product in the morning before applying my make up my skin is fresh
using my luna at night
started using it again in the morning in the shower
i still use it every night as a wash
at night with my clarisonic
i recently bought this product after reading in an article that weekly exfoliation should start in your early 20's
i used it in the shower on my face
i work it on my face for at least 30 seconds before rinsing
second time using it as an am treatment for my no makeup day: every time i had to wash my h
s in the bathroom i would look up at the mirror
then i started using this every morning in the shower
on day 2 of using this product
i used every morning for about 3 weeks because it's that gentle
i went from needing an hour hour to do my makeup
its gentle enough for every day
spf/everything off before relaxing
keep in the shower
only tried at night.
only use it at night although the bottle says to use am/pm
may spring for it one day as my skin practically glows at night
i look forward to putting it on each night
use this only at night
soft when i wake up
i would wait like 5 minutes for it to soak in before you get into bed
i totally forgot about it until i found it last night while cleaning
i put it on this morning
used it one night
the instructions were to smooth on skin- am or pm
this morning i re-visited the sample this morning prior to putting on foundation
usually by mid-to-late afternoon i have to bust out my oil blotting sheets
evening out skin tone
i sometimes pick at my face before bed.
my skin in the morning looked
when i use this product at night i always have radiant skin the next morning
have been happy with this combined day / night routine
the best part for me is that my skin looks more refreshed in the morning
i apply it before bed after my reitnol absords into my skin
happy in the morning
used in the mornings
when i wake up in the morning my skin feels soft
i started using this as a night moisturizer in addition to my ddmg during the winter when my skin was getting dry
i will probably not repurchase after i run out until the winter unless my skin starts breaking out worse
this is a nice night time cream.
it just drinks it up
i break out almost every day
not greasy in the morning
wow is what i said when i woke up after using this moisturizer
when i wake up in the morning i feel like my face is extra greasy
that's my night treatment
i pair it with the daytime product and love it.
i shower before bed
i notice that when i wake up my skin looks fresh.
after the 1st week of using this
i wake up with just a little shine on my tzone
as well as any present acne the morning after i use this
i still notice an improvement every morning after i use it
only use this every other night
i wear it night and day.
i don't go a single night without using this as a part of my face care routine
into the next day
was out in the sun too long one day
used this at night
i also use this during the day
this is great when combined with the moisture surge in the morning
i pair this with superdefense that i use for daytime
i apply it before i go to bed
at night it does the job
it is my gulity pleasure at the end of the day to slather it all over my face
more plump when i wake up in the morning
i got both the day
during the colder months in chicago
started using it at night
it's too heavy for me to use during the day time
i put this on at night along with my regular facial routine
many times i use it on it's own at night
that i can use during the day/morning on makeup days to play nice
i apply at night after lenses are taken out
disclaimer: i'm in my mid-20s
will use this morning
day for the rest of my life
i've never posted a review before
tip: when i'm at the last bit of the cream
am unable to get it at this time
am back to using it twice a day
it is evening out my skin.
i am not wiping oil off of my face at 3 pm at work
ordinarily i would get shiny by afternoon
wore it out that same evening
a few days later i noticed that each morning i woke up with perfect matted skin
i only use one pump a day
this is my favorite evening moisturizer to use during the warm months because it's light
when i take it off at 8 or 9 pm my skin is still perfect
my complexion is evening out
at night time however
i put it on after i wash my face in the morning
i am in my late 30s
it get's very humid in the summer
i don't use this during the day as i use a mattifiier
then i started to wear it at night to moisturize my skin instead of during the day
i normally blot my face 2-3 times a day at work
it keeps my face matte for many hours in the day
my face is oil free all day
keeps my t-zone shine free for hours
this night cream was my master switch to start over again
i wake up with the softest skin i've ever had in my life every time i wear this product
wonderful when i wake up in the morning
this is my favourite night cream by far.
when i apply this before i head to bed
i am in my mid 20's
in the morning you wake up feeling like you had a mask on without noticing
supple when i wake up in the morning
chin before i go to sleep
love the feeling after i apply it before going to bed
i always find myself returning to this night cream
it's my first time using this night cream
my face is soft when i wake up in the morning.
now i enjoy my nightly cleansing ritual because i get to use this at the end
the next day i wake up
this cream prepares my skin for the next day!
leaves it so soft for 24 hours.
this is definitely my best winter night cream.
best night cream i have ever used!!!!
4 stars for this night cream only because i prefer the $93 night cream better for my age
the tub it comes in will last a loooong time
i do use it nightly
i always wake up looking better than the night before
every night i go to bed with the knowledge
i wake up looking like i slept for 10 hours--even if i've only slept for 5
until one day i woke up in september
once in the evening right before bed
i wash my face twice a day
the all over clearing treatment during the day
this is my 3rd day of use
i followed the directions to use them twice a day
i used it in the morning
the other two only at night
this clears it up overnight
time again after terrible results with other br
then i use in the night only or maybe in the morning
after one wash i noticed my skin the next day clearing up
he goes through the whole three step regimen every night
only downside is that i'm on my 2nd bottle in less than a month
(use 2 pumps, twice a day).
started using this to shower with before or/
especially after wearing make-up all day
this is the 2nd time i got it
i don't use the other steps at night
i do use the face wash twice a day
the next morning i woke up
this will zap them in a day
it is the difference between a light vacuuming once a week
one night i forgot to put my regular moisturizer over this after a shower
sometimes ill put it on a spot during the day as well
what i got this month expires on oct 2014.
by the end of our trip
it will disappear by the end of the day
the next morning they were totally gone
i would put it on before bed
i usually apply it in the evening before bed
within a week i could see my skin clearing.
i put a dab on the night before
it literally works overnight.
as part of my nighttime routine
knowing this now i will make sure to put something over the pillow case on nights when i'm using it
it will get rid of it over night
which i just during the day
i put this stuff on in the morning
i used it after cleaning my face in the morning
applying this on problem spots when i wake up in the morning
the only catch is i have to apply it last thing at night for it to work
first thing in the morning i see the results right away
for me this can be prevented by making sure i put my moisturizer on first at night
i usually put it on at night on my problem areas
i put this product on at night
it did dry out my skin after using it everyday/twice a day
if i apply before bed
it is noticeably better by the next morning
it'd look good-as-new the next morning
they all gone the next morning after one apply of the night before
i'll start out using it 2x a day then once my skin starts to clear up ill use it 1x a day
i like to put it on at night on spots
it clears it up overnight
i did this every night for 2 weeks
i put it on trouble spots at night only after i apply moisturizer
until the next breakout
i put it on the before i sleep
i kept using it every night
last august in 2016 i used an expired sunscreen on my face
the product took a while at first to see results
the morning after useing this was the first morning in a year that i did not wake up with a new pimple
i only use it once a night
s immediately after i use it
i will write back in the next month or two in order to discuss my further
when i know i'm not leaving the house or when it's an overcast day
i'll apply it in the morning
i only use it at night
i get compliments on my face daily
literally the next day after trying the lightening gel for the first time
at night before applying epiduo
i am 95% ready to go make-up free
i took pictures the first day i used this
i will forever incorporate it into my morning
i saw much faster results on my chest where i applied it twice a day than on my face where i was afraid to apply the product during the day when i would be exposed to the sun
i did that at first
i stopped using it in early january
started using it at night
clinique in the morning
like being outside in the sweltering heat
i put it on almost every night after i cleanse
can only use it at night time
i didn't breakout unitl my early 20s
i usually do my facial routine in the morning
tone at the same time
after a workout or at the end of a long day.
he uses them every day, twice a day.
i apply it in the morning and in the evening.
although apparently our teen has been using them mid-afternoon
after being outside in the heat
he uses it daily after washing his face
use them through the day
whenever i used this cream the night before
i only apply at night time before i go to sleep.
i then bought the night cream
this is my favorite night cream
when i wake up
i woke up the next morning
i couldn't believe the results after just one night
glowing in the morning
i wake up with a silky soft face every morning
because it is a night cream
radiant the day after i use this
i find that it makes my skin glow after using it maybe 3 or 4 nights in a row
i carefully applied the cream on the next few nights
the results i got in just a few nights were amazing
even skin tone versus the one night st
one day while washing my face
every morning i wake up with plump
came across the vinoperfect night cream
i received my cream on last friday
when i woke up on saturday morning my face was bright
i wake up in the morning
just after three days i was waking up in the morning with brighter skin
evening out my skin tone
i also use this as a day cream when i need an extra boost in the winter
even if i skip a night not putting this on
with a good nights sleep in just a couple of weeks
more radiant the next morning
i am on my second one
in the morning when i wake up
i used it as my night time mosturizer
i would wake up every morning with skin so smooth
use it all over face every night.
i love the way my skin feels when i wake up in the morning
i woke up each morning
supposed you are following the proper cleansing procedure every morning
i used this a while back in addition to the matching day cream
am on the same regime again
i used this cream every night for over a month
when i would wake up the next morning
this is the best night cream i have used.
since using this cream at night
especially for a night cream
after the second time i used it my skin looked awsome in the morning
i look forward to putting it on after i cleanse my face at nite
when i wake up in the morning my skin is brighter
healthy when i wake up
when i wake up in the morning my skin looks bright
after using this in the pm
when i wake up in the morning
i wake up to beautiful skin every morning.
i love this night cream and am on my third jar.
this is my new favorite night cream!
i can't go without my night cream!
she won't go spend good money on herself to help with it unless it's at a drug store so after just a few days she's not waking up with lines on her face
i could see a difference the next morning
try this night cream
seriously woke up the next morning
when i wake up in the morning
i even use it around my eyes at night instead of a seperate eye cream
i apply it to my face and neck every night.
that’s okay since i only wear it to bed
smooth in the mornings when i wake up
this is the 3rd time i've purchased this night cream
this is the best night cream i ever used.
i feel revitalized in the morning
i used this at night
smell off you after a long day outside in the dirt
just daily when i shower
use this in the shower
i even shower sometimes twice a day
wash my face anywhere from 2-4 times a day
i didn't start getting acne until my early 20s
finally end of april beginning.
i only use the bar at night before bed otherwise it's too strong for my face
most recently starting again in october
one in the shower
great for after workout and before bed!
i do wear a rich face cream to bed at night
this bar will last forever
especially during the winter
i keep this in the shower
face in the shower in the morning
i leave this overnight
that's because i'm up late working on work for summer classes
i wake up later in the day sometimes from being sleep deprived
once at night either before i go out or before i go to sleep
i can't wait to be camera ready during all of my performances
wanted to prepare for the summer
i typically wash at least once/day with my clarisonic
what i ended up doing is using it every 3rd day.
lasts a long time-more bang for your buck
i wash in the morning
it removes all my make up at the end of the day
the next morning i do my normal ritual
because i didnt wash my face the night before during the day my skin gets super oily
the cleansing oil at night if i had makeup on during the day
after i use it
if i end up using it twice in a day i typically with follow up with a cream
after a week of this my face looks better
when i break out it usually takes anywhere from a week/week
i used one pump of this tonight to cleanse
it's the summer time
mostly in the mornings
depending on the weather
i am currently on my second bottle
its great for night time
i will continue to use every night.
more dry at the moment
even without using it every day
i saw results the next day
then at night everyday after that
luckily it worked for me only using at night under my regular moisturizer
it either disappears or just dramatically improves by the time i wake up in the morning
best product to use every night
my only skin issues is if i sleep in my makeup too many nights in a row
so used once last night before bed
then at night i used this product as an overnight treatment
i begin to break out again as soon as the next day
since make this a part of my morning ritual its all clear
i like to put in on after washing my face before bed
i wear it under the boscia bb cream as part of my morning ritual
use it at night before i go to bed with my eye cream
i will keep using it till i finish the bottle.
pm after washing my face
isn't sitting on my face fo days
no where near as bad as before
i put it on day
i saw this at sephora one day
it was at its worst at the time
i leave it on for a minute or two
use this in the morning
a regular cleanser leaves my skin fire truck red for at least an hour
i only use it once per day when going to bed
it is a staple in my morning skin care routine
take the day off
i don't use this at the end of the day
it's great in the morning
when i get out of the shower
winter is tough on my completion.
i've used it both in the mornings
now i use it every morning in the shower on my face
in the evening followed by the daily relief cream
to use only in the morning before makeup
that was until i found this cream.
i apply it in the morning
i am super red for about 3 minutes
i apply twice a day after cleansing
i put it on at night
my skin is perfect in the morning after a good nights sleep with this stuff
great as part of my night routine
any contact with my skin leaves me red for the next few hours
use it every night so
with my morning routine if needed
it is light enough to use during the day
i didn't like using this in my morning routine during the summer as it just felt too heavy
tomorrow, i am going to buy this cream again.
i put it on in the morning before i apply makeup.
i am now down to oracea
cooling when it goes on
i can use it year-round in mid-atlantic heat
then i apply it after a more intense moisturizer at night
i only use my skincare routine once a day at night
after my night time skincare routine i go to bed
i saw results within the hour
gives a "near-naked" feeling a few minutes after use
capturetotale one essential in the morning
it is gone overnight
even after a week of nightly
works its magic through the night
no oily next morning
due to the winter cold
i noticed for the first time that my skin was beginning to get dry
bought the night cream a week later
w/ at least an spf of 30 during the day
i always come back to the nutriperfect night cream
i even use it in the day time
my new favorite night cream.
love using this before an event
this is like magic in 10 minutes!
finally used it last night
i did feel some tingling during the 10 minutes
this will be part of my weekly routine.
this will be a staple in my routine
in addition to giving me glowing skin the next day
i am going to add it to my weekly regimen though.
need to look your best by friday night
pre-friday night ritual product!
did it every night
slept with it on
no breakouts the next day
i leave it on for 30 minutes instead of the recommended 10
i woke up with no new breakouts
used it last night
wash it in the morning
for the feel of it on my face-- after 10 minutes
i put it on at night for 10 minutes
the next day when i looked in the mirror mid day
more throughout the day
i tried this tonight
i might try leaving it on for an hour next time
i tried this out for the first time last night
instead of leaving it on for only 10 minutes
my skin looked even better the next morning
i just bought the wake wonderful night-time facial to use in conjunction with the mask
i leave on for 15 minutes
i can hardly wait for sunday nights when i use all of my special face treatments
woke up this morning like my face looks awesome!
this mask is effective at evening out my skin tone
usually use at night
i wake up to feel like my skin is near recovery
i leave it for 20minutes
used it last night
i left it on for 20 minutes instead of 10
until someone at sephora recommended this
more clear by morning
after reading some reviews i left it on for 15min
am using it once a week to get started
i've slept in it before
had excellent results in the morning
i put it on before getting in the shower
making this a part of my beauty routine from now on
i am in my mid-50's
tried this out on a friday night worrying it might irritate my skin
i actually left it on for about 15 minutes instead of 10
i leave it on over night
it works best if you leave in on over night
is it friday yet?
they next day after using the mask my face is glowing
wait at least 10 to 15 minutes after cleansing to apply it to keep it from stinging
last month i went to my local sephora to discuss my skin woes
at home i put it on
the first night i did my routine of taking off makeup with olive oil
the next morning my face was definitely a lot softer
first time i used this powder was at night
generally use it at night before bed
i am going to start washing my h
it gets better with each week.
it's part of my morning regime
i added it into my skii toner every night before i go to bed
i went away for the weekend
i partied for days straight
i tried this on a whim while shopping online late at night
did you get 8 hours of sleep or something?
i wake up with refreshed
this is my go to every day part of my skin care routine
i am in my late 40's
for the first time since i was a teenager i can leave the house without makeup
my skin brightens instantly after putting this on in the morning
night as apart of my skin care routine
i recommend waiting about 10-15 mins after cleansing your face before you put this on
i am on my second bottle
tried it again the second night by combining it with bio-oil as i use it as a moisturizer at night
using half a scoop morning
i used it morning
i would say it works especially after i am under the blazing sun for long time
it's part of my daily routine
i could barely stand to wear it, even at night.)
i mix it in on morning with my moisterizer.
now i use at night
this product makes you look more awake the morning after using it
i am starting to get a few age spots
i only use this at night before i go to sleep
its an awesome add on to my day/night creams!
the powder at the same time
started using it morning
this seems to be evening out my skin tone.
i try to use it twice a day
i saw results the next morning!!!
on days where i get enough sleep
the day after applying this i look refreshed/rested
may begin using a different eyecream for my night-time routine once this jar runs out
tried it on before i went to bed
i am in my early 20's
i began to drink a glass of water every night before going to bed
putting a little on every night
after using it morning
i didn't notice until this morning when i looked at my eyes bam
until age really starts to set in :p
i apply in the morning and before bed.
i saw a difference in 24 hours
will update after a month.
i notice a difference when i don't use this in the morning
tried it last night
it'll hold all day
the next day my skin was almost back to normal
pm where as in winter i use it in the am
in the pm the moisture surge overnight mask
i used it tonight
doesn't feel greasy on my face when i apply or when i wake up in the morning
i've ran out and am dying to get more tomorrow.
unless i drink tons of water every day
i love how my skin feels when i wake up the next day
i can put this on in the morning
at night i put an oil on top
when i woke up
every morning, i put this all over my face.
i actually enjoy putting it on because i start my morning feeling refreshed
i put it on in the morning
i put it on in the morning right before i apply my makeup
use a little extra in the winter
love this product for morning use when i need something light to put on before makeup
in an every-other-night sort of way
i spend a lot of time outside
absorbs super quickly which is important for the mornings when i'm short on time which is frequently
if i go to a friend's house for the night
when i use this morning
i used that evening after i cleaned my face
use again that morning b4 make-up
great to use in the morning and night .
my foundation stays all day
softer the next morning
i wake up in the morning
i apply it at night
still feels that way the morning after i put it on at night
i started using this at night since i use photo plasma during the day
my makeup looks just as good at 7:30pm as it did at 7:30am
used it one night when i ran out of my usual retinol night cream
when i woke up the next morning my skin looked smooth
the texture i accumulate during the day is gone by morning
even after hours i can still smell it.
maybe when i run out of my night moisturizer i'll get this
i am in my 40's with dry
peely skin the next day
under murad's oil control mattifier spf 15 during the day
after an 8 hour day i can normally feel a pimple or two under my skin
use it after i put on the dmae high potency evening repair
glowing in the morning
also alternate some nights
can get slightly oily in the t zone at the end of the day
i first used this when i was having a custom make up session
night for best results
at the moment it's normal/dry in the winter
shine free all day
after a couple of days where i had to rush my beauty routine
i only use it at night though.
i mainly use this at night
it lasts all day
i love this evening cream
when i wake up in the morning after using it my skin looks brighter
face feels refreshed in the morning.
normally i use it only at night
with a little facial oil added for nights/winter
at the end of the day it promises
ilove this product at night
after the first night i noticed my face return to the glow of the past
at first i didnt use it
just got this in the mail today.
i put this product on at night
i put it on every night before going to bed.
when i put it on at night i look about twelve
i wanted a night cream
i am on my third month
it is the only night cream i have ever tried that goes on almost dry
when i wake up in the morning my skin is dry
speeds up my morning just enough to make a difference :
i am in awe of how fast it actually broke down my 24 hour
doing 2 pumps in the morning
3-4 pumps in the evening
wash my face both morning
i wash first thing in the am
before i go to bed at night
i am on my second bottle
while on a prolonged trip i ran out of this product while in france
(morning, post workout, evening).
wash then use it with my clairsonic in the evening
when followed by day or night serum
i hear early 30s starts it
applying this at night really helps keep crows feet to a minimum
often when i wake up in the am
at first didn't see results
the timezone change had my sleep schedule off
while i really like it for the daytime
most mornings i need less makeup than i used to
i only put it on at night
ts going to last a long time
overall after about a week i noticed that i looked more awake
great for using in the morning.
reduced to using only at night
my skin tone is evening out.
i break out if i wash it more than once a day
i spend a lot of time outside
am hoping to see results after continued use
after 2 days of using this cleanser morning
break up during the day
shortly after i started using it my husb
i used it morning
oil off my face after a long day
i am in my mid 40's
i wash my face morning
used it at night
then at night only
i've used this for 10 days every night
another bonus is the tone of my skin is evening out as well
when sephora had the 20% off vib event
am hoping it will last
you didn't age overnight
i applied this for the first time this morning
if you use two or three pumps twice a day on a cotton pad
i apply morning and night with a cotton pad.
it's perfect for waking up my skin/face in the mornings
i started using this last night
i can't wait to use it day after day.
wakes you up when used in the morning
after the very first day i was in love
i went off the bc pill at the same time
for pm use this is perfect
use this in morning
use it in the am/pm everyday
nighttime in the shower
i look forward to washing my face with this each time
then one day i go to wash my face
good for morning skin routine
i only use it once a day in the mornings
at night before bed followed by the sheer moisturizer
i only use it at night.
probably better to try out the lighter version of this during summer time
lasts through the night
its so nice in the winter to wear under a day cream
good to use morning and night.
and during the day with the beauty shot.
i live in a really humid area
dry at the same time
being in my late 20's
i only use it on occasion.
the day cream was too heavy
there's no greasy feel when you wake up in the morning
i wear it every work day undermakeup
wear it alone on weekends
is when i wake up in the morning
with water in the morning
at night with my seaberry oil from fresh
i would recommend using just a dab on each area to begin with
i just wish they had spf in it since it's a day cream
i'll update after a few week's of use
if i am having a dry day
however as a night cream its perfect!
this day cream is my second favorite
not oily at all during the day
until i got my sephora order the other day
i tried it last night for the first time
i woke up this morning
that afternoon i happened to stop by sephora
just got it yesterday
as a result i only use this at night
black seed oil in the evening
as the day went on
i just hope the bottle lasts for a while...
so a small amount is enough for coverage in the morning before i apply my makeup
the best day cream for winter season!
in just one night
my skin is night
i applied it after washing my face per usual.
i am in my early 20's
i reccomend this product during a cold day
for the times i am oily
this cream can be used as a morning
perfect under foundation, at night, anytime.
i also use it at night.
works well alone or as a first layer during the day
only in the mornings
at first i was cautious about using this cream in the summer
i could just keep on applying it for an hour
this product alone manage to keep it shine free for several hours
t will last a while
usually will get shiny later in the day
you will wake up with a balance skin tone every morning
this little bottle of miracles works magic on mattifying the 3pm shine despite being applied at 7am
i don't need to powder my t-zone later in the day
i love this day cream, i use it at night as well.
no waiting time to soak in
however, it is not a 24-hour cream!
for the first week i was using it at night as well
i noticed less shine in the morning
through out the day
after a couple hours it left a terrible residue on my face yuck
during the day ontop of my serum under make-up
i break out a lot at the end of the day
great for daily use, both morning & night.
this mask did a great job evening out my skin tone
i leave it on for longer than 10 minute
this is where it’s at!
the super skin glow kicks in after about two hours
it takes until the next morning to really see the effects of the mask
by the next morning my skin is smooth
when i get home
soft my skin was after only 10 minutes
after 10 or so minutes of wearing the mask
the next morning after i put my normal make up
i received my package of the givenchy black for light mask last night
i couldn't note much of a difference the next morning
yesterday i had a full face
clear for the next day
i am early on using this product
this is a little heavy for me in the summer
looks like i got a full night sleep instead of sleeping in the back of a truck
only using it at night
i also use this every morning religiously.
used in the pm
i only use this cream in the am
the next morning had forgot i used it
i wake up the next morning with soft
it was during the hottest
tried it out in the morning
i got this btadc to use primarily as a night cream
substantial cream, nice as an over-nighter.
my makeup melts off my face nearly 5 hrs earlier than usual
am on my third pot
the morning after i tried it out
i plan on purchasing it to use as a night cream during the winter
using youth preserve as part of my winter morning routine
when i wake up in the morning my skin looks so refreshed
i generally just use it in the morning
a little heavy for the daytime
i did use once for overnight
only use it every night before bed
within a week of using this cream morning
love it for around my eyes at night.
especially during the cold weather season when the air is dry
now i am on my second jar
i sometimes use it during the day
i apply it to my whole face before go to bed
during the day i only apply to the dry part of my face
t's definitely too heavy for daytime
it was a bit heavy for day wear
only used it at night
when i woke up in the morning
i chose to use it at night
only on some trouble spots during the day
i went out the next day
i saw results after using the full black tea age delay line within the first day
that is what i need for a winter time night cream
i get out of the shower
when you wake up
this product firmed them up over night
didnt like this at first.
now i am at the bottom of the container
would have been a less greasy face after i slept with this cream overnight
this is where i will stay for an overnight cream
i feel like i am at the spa every night when i put this luxurious cream on
this morning i took the plunge
since i'm so oily i use this only at night
i only use it at night right now
sometimes i sleep in it.
i immediatley went to sephora that day
i keep it in my shower.
the result will not disappear after i wash my face in the next morning which is really amazing
i work nights full time
when i wake up in the morning
for a product you wash off after 5-10 minutes
and i leave it on for at least an hour.
rejuvinated the next morning
if hours at that
used it once tonight
i leave it on for about a half an hour
despite the fact that most people take it off the next morning
it worked great on evening out my combination skin
whether i'd rather just use a night cream
i usually wear this at night
leave it on until the next morning
in the morning i was shocked
i wore it overnight
in the morning my skin was fresh
this is my go to mask to pep my skin up before an important event or especially the days when i get less than six hours of sleep
makes you look like you've slept for 9 hours
few more hours of sleep"
i left it on while i slept
even over night for extra tightening
preferably on sundays where i try to give my face a sabbatical from make-up for the day
this morning, woke up at 9 a.m.
and am about to head into work here at 4:30.
let it soak in for a good 20 minutes before my shower
i apply it every other night after i've washed my face
i feel the effects the next morning
will continue to use it in my day to day regimen
once i started using this every night/morning my skin became flawless
i decided to put the mask on tonight
bring on winter skin
the next morning my skin is glowing
before i go to bed
i still cry about it at night
take off the day
wake up on a winter day
after i use it
been using it morning
would recommend using a more gentle one in the morning
if i use it both in the morning
if you put on a night time moisturizer on directly afterwards
oil of my skin from the day
to use in my daily routine
this cleanser takes it all right off at the end of the night
good for just freshening up in the middle of the day on non-makeup days too
fresh every night after using it
need to clean your face at night
on my lazy days, this is the way to go.
beucase i can use this every night to clean he back of my neck area
this is my "go to" product when i am too tired to wash my face at night
to tone at the same time
on occasion all over my face
sometimes i'll wear it alone before bed
it sat around my room for months
when i woke up in the morning my skin had drank up all the oil
when i woke up the next morning my face felt absolutely amazing
i used it at night for the first time
literally the next morning
every morning i wake up my skin looks amazing
in my mid 20s now
this is now a staple in my nightly routine.
i pat it on every morning after i shower
when i wake up in the morning i have this wonderful glow
even now in mid-july
i can put this on before work or bed
i apply it all over my face before bed
twice a week i wash
condition in the shower
my skin was dried half an hour after i applied it on
i love utilizing this oil during the winter all over the face as a moisturizer before bed
i love to use it right before bed.
i really like this at night time as the last step in my skincare routine for the extra hydration
leave that over night
i used this instead of my usual night cream
at the end of the day
i put it on at night after i've washed my face.
use it every night
am able to use morning
my daily routine now!
it's a cold/windy day ahead
it is perfect as a night time oil
sometimes i'll just use the oil as a moisturizer itself during the night time
until i found this one
the regular at night
put more on during the night
i apply it in the morning after my regular moisturizer routine
also once at night
the light version underneath make up in the morning
i apply it at night
in the morning after my shower
i put it on in the evening before bed
again after i wash m face in the morning
at first i was a little taken back at the fact that i was recommended i put oils on my skin at night by my facialist
the regular one for day
by the next morning it was almost invisible
i also mix a few drops in with my moisturiser in the morning
s immediately after showering
halfway through my day
i applied it every night on my face
i live in a very cold snowy place
it's the only thing i use on my face at night
since i hav been using this every night i wake up with soft silky skin
using this cream every other day in just three weks i can seee the difference in my skin
which was nice for mornings or before makeup
i will use this every winter!
until i found this
it wasn't until the next morning when i woke up to soft skin that i felt moisturized
i still needed a cream the next day
being in the air all the time winter is normally a nightmare for me
i tried it on my 15 hour flight.
it stays in place
got this hoping my skin would not dry out during flights
i arrived after a 6 hour flight looking just as good as when i boarded the plane
my skin gets back to normal in 1-2 days
especially in the hot summer weather
on the nights i dare to skip it
especially during humid days
a life saver during winter!
i apply it at night along with my shiseido nightcream
just it at night
night before my spf
i decided to spring for the bottle
one pump at night along with the josie maran argan oil
i apply it day
especially during the winter, it's a must.
smooth in the morning
since you're applying it so soon after a shower
then make-up during the day
i then put my regular products on.
at first i used it with the ultimate creme at night
the first morning i woke up
it happens every morning until i finished my creme
used it last night
for those of you who are still in your late teens or early twenties
take care of your skin before its too late
i put this on twice a day
when i apply it in the morning it lasts all day
no need to apply it again at night.
when i wake up the next morning
i wear it when i exercise out side.
was very oily during the day
if you're in a hurry in the morning
which is fine in the winter
and use the superrescue at night.
the sun protection is great for every day.
it doesnt run thru out the day
now i love using this in the morning
at the same time
i apply the clinique superdefense in the mornings
usually about three hours after washing it looks oily
after 14 hours my face still looks fresh!
perfect for summer and humid weather.
more worried about sun damages-texture is just right for fall/winter/spring in boston area
like 2hrs after washing my face
only use this in the cooler months when i am outside less
i would recommend a second choosing in the afternoon
the spf for summer
dry in the morning
oily by the end of the day
love this moisterizer for day and night.
i look like i have a glow every day even when i get no sleep
i put it on before i go out in the morning
if it's very sunny or i will be out most of the day
not good enough for a day at the beach
great for the winter and summer.
i am almost done with my first one
need sun protection every day
i keep going back to this as my fall through spring everyday sunscreen
this is a cream i am happy to use in the summer
i only need one pump at night
half a pump in the morning
i didn't go greasy an hour later
i forgot that this cleanser had a special feature until i used the mini
i wash with it twice a day
this for more heavy duty end of day
philosophy's microdelivery wash in the am
even after an hour long swim session when my face is pretty sensitive this resores it's balance
or alternate every other day
the side i sleep on
rejuvenating in both morning
ready for the day
especially during the day
use it as a night cream
while being greasy at the same time
i've just been using it once daily at bedtime
break-out prone skin that now has to spend 9 hours a day in an office that is as dry as a desert -- seriously: i left a tangerine on my desk on a friday
by the after-holiday tuesday it was completely dried out
i put it away until this winter.
yes i put it on at night too
no more dry cheeks in the mid afternoon
this gets me through the coldest of days.
i instead use it as my "go to" night cream
after using this cream each morning
people think i am in my early 40's
you can use it day or night.
although i actually use it at night instead of day because it's a little heavy for me
i also enjoyed this cream at night to make sure my face was pampered after too much sun
i used for the first time at night
when i woke up in the morning
when i applied it before i left the house in the morning
i am beginning to break out
am going back to this product
i used this cream after a heavy work out
when i woke up in the morning
i decided to give the day cream a try
stays on all day.
i am just about to turn 25
night time which was important to me
great for am or pm.
am ordering the second
i pat it into my eye area day and night.
i applied it at night
it's nice not to have to worry about running to bathroom or a conference room to use oil absorbing sheets before a meeting
one application in the morning is enough!
this is my second day of wearing it.
5 hours after application i would be drenched in oil
after 8 hours i could have used a blot
i usually need to blot by mid day
my makeup stays exactly how it looked in the morning
though it's warm outside where i live
i hope it's gonna work the same way during hot summer days too
that five o'clock shine will forever be my enemy
typically i apply every day
at the 6 hour mark
i am good for 8 hrs or so
i don't have to blot my face with oil papers at all during the workday
at the end of my 9-hour shift i'll still be matte
lasts most of the day and in hot humid weather.
i put it on after my skin care regimen at night
first day i used it
powder once or twice a day
i put this on at 6:30am
my face is still matte when i go to bed at 10:30pm
this kept me matte through my 14 hour days.
my make up stays in place longer
the first day i was in love.
i go on throughout my day not worrying about oil showing up through my makeup
i still have to blot once or twice a day
in the winter it's works better 8+ hours of oil control
within about 1 hr my nose starts to get shiny
the first day i used this i did not need one blotting sheet
you blot every few hours
i keep two full bottles on deck just in case of an emergency
by the end of the day i'm my normal oily.
i've also used this when spending the day at the beach
i work 12-16hr shifts in a very busy hospital where i don't always have time to touch up my makeup
my face would get super oily after a few hours
i go about my regular skin routine
initially i felt like i still saw a bit of shine after 8 hours or so
i am using it for a while
this makes my night cleansing routine one step.
it works great at controlling my t-zone throughout the day
i do was my face morning
i usually use this cleanser at night to take off my make up
in the evening after i take my make up off
i usually will have to wash twice at night
the tube will last you a while
because of this product i am now tuned into the clarins line
leaving it rest on your face for 1-2 minutes
this tube will last a while.
use this cleanser twice a day am/pm i rinse with cool water in the morning
i also use with my clarisonic at night.
i normally use different face wash in the morning
my go to cleanser for the night time !
it is very effective at cleaning the skin at the end of the day or refreshing it in the morning
after using it morning
i also use renova at night.
i look in the regular mirror afterwards
waited to try it until last saturday nite--big nite out w/ the girls
wish i would have tried the night cream first.
every night before bed i apply this night cream
my results after 5 weeks with continuously applying the eye cream morning
great night time eye cream
it's light and perfect for day and night use.
i put this on morning
i look refreshed when i wake up in the morning
this eye cream is perfect for the day time.
people have even commented that i look more awake despite the fact i'm still only sleeping 5 hours a night
about 30 minutes later i happened to go to the ladies room
using it both in the morning
night all around my eyes
i swear i woke up one day last week with my eyes hooding
i noticed last month that i was getting hooding on my eyelids
murad spf 15 eye cream during the day over this
i apply it faithfully every morning and night.
i typically use it in the morning
i massage it to my eye area at night only
because i use an eye cream with spf during the day
best for night use in my opinion.
let's say i put it on before bed -- i woke up
my nightly regimen goes as follows:1.
i am only using every other day
i started using this every other night
tried to go up to every night 3 weeks in
dry the next morning
spf 30 at least during the day time
use every other day to start.
work my way up to mondays wednesday
i started using it every other night
my skin glows the next day after i had it on overnight
i apply it at night
only using it every third night
started using every other night
esp under my makeup sat nights
each day i use it i wake up
also when i use it at night
i did spend some time with a red face
i used this every other night initially
i suspect i will arrive at the finish line with the same results as the retin a
worked my way up to every other night
except for at the very beginning when i used it on my neck
everyone should have poetry in lotion as part of their weekly routine
will make the trip to get it
on my first night
when i washed my face that night
applied it at night
i don't think i could use this every night- right now i use it around 3 nights a week
i am still waiting for full results
started every other night
was able to work back up to every other night after a week of every third night
use every 2nd day
then every other then every night as tolerated
great to use at night
truly i saw results after the first night i used it
i stayed with it until i colud use it every night
i am now on my second botte.
i started by applying it every other day
not every other day
i can only use 1 pump every second or third day
once every other day

i am going a month without
so long as i use a night time
i am in my mid-30s
spf 20 at the same time
moreeven in the morning when i put that cream on
is the best day cream i've ever had
people are saying it is greasy during the day
i actually went out of the house last weekend without heavy concealer
apply this in the morning under my bb cream
it has your daily face sun block in it
i take that thing with me whenever i overnight somewhere or go on vacation since its convenient
its light enough for the summer too!
the tone of my skin seems to be evening out
even after an entire day out in the sun
i applied it in the morning after cleansing
the other correcter at night
after just one night of use
this is a great option for morning routine since its not too greasy

nothing works over night
i am in my early 30s
i can see the result the next morning
i usually use this every morning
i just ordered a day
i can use it as night cream or under the makeup during the day
then i forgot to put it on one morning

as time goes on
after 4 days i went right back to using it am
i am in my late 50's
like i've gotten a good 8 hrs sleep
i tried this product in a sample size when i was on holiday in mexico where it was quite hot
i couldn't believe what i saw in the mirror the very first morning after using this
the sample made me look like i'd slept serenely for 9 hours
keep me mosturized all day
after i am through with this jar i will repurchase until i find the perfect eye cream
until then this will be my new hg
this winter has really taken its toll on my skin here in the northeast

late in posting my review
a part of my daily routine
i usually use this cleaner when i wash my face at night
he uses it at night
ready to apply my night skin routine
because my night time routine
refresh my skin for my morning care
ready for the day/night
i am sure i'll order this again when the time comes
follow with the sleeping mask
i work mostly nights
i used this after another night of tossing
in my sleep deprived morning routine i might not have had an even amount on both eyes
every single morning i wake up with puffy
throughout the day when i need a pick me up
than at night after i wash my face
it was gone overnight
use it every single morning
night after i cleanse my face
let it sit for a few minutes
even when i have a great nights rest i look super tired
i did have to apply it a few times the 1st few mornings
i try to use it every day
sometimes at night as well as in the morning
when i wake up
when i wake up
after using it every day when i wake up i noticed that i looked much more awake
i feel that it "wakes me up" in the morning.
just used them before bed
on days when i don't use it
make me look more awake
i still use it sparingly in the morning
a decent amount at night
would recommend only using at night instead of the morning if you have oily skin
i used this cream every night
the rest of my body after i get out of the shower
i pat this on my face at night instead of rubbing it
i do not use this during the day.
only at night for more like a night cream.
light enough for summer
i put it on day
the moisture lasts all day when i put it on in the morning
in the morning before your makeup
i need it every day especially in winter.
i won't use this in the summer time to much because it can feel like a second later of skin during hot humid days
when i had a cold
under my makeup during the day in drier times of winter
for my body after a shower
i don't wake up in the morning looking like a glass mirror
by using just a little bit of this cream twice daily
within a day my skin is back to normal.
a part of my daily routine
i ran to sephora this weekend to stock up!
you can feel the difference after 12 hours.
at the same time it soaks in almost immediately
my skin usually breaks out for about a week
i put it on at night
the sample lasted me 4 nights
dewy within a couple of minutes
my flakes would be back in a matter of hours
i applied this cream almost every night
ready for the day in the morning

irritation from just applying it once in the morning before makeup
at night after i wash my face to go to sleep
i think i'm going to start applying morning as well
am red most of the time
set me back more than $200 for the office visit
on in the evenings
i started misting my face with avene thermal spring water right after my shower at night
the first time i did this
i now do this every single night
om people this week alone came up to me while i was out
i put it on every night before bed
i look substantially more rested in the mornings than i did before
by morning my skin is
i can see the difference the next morning after using this product
radiant by the next morning after using it
i apply it every night
this in the pm
it's best to start using it every other day
now i do not use it every day-started 1x a week for the first wk
try skipping a day or so
on the nights i am not using it
i am now up to 4x a week
i am starting to see a lightening of my age spots on my face
after i apply out of the shower
i then later with my favorite night cream
apply at night before my normal routine/products
disclaimer: i'm in my mid-20s
i see results the next day
i love using this at night.
i used every night
when i woke up the next morning i noticed my skin looked fairly the same
which i am against
i apply this over night
this is basically all i use at night
the sample was enough for me to use it on a daily basis for a week
the past couple mornings my skin tone is amazing
nearly everyone from their mid-to-late 20s
i only use this before bed.
started at every other day
i started using it nightly
brightens after about a week of use
i still apply my night time cream overtop before bed
i gave it four instead of five stars because my skin looks best when i combine it with the dermadoctor picture porefect during the daytime
after one week of nightly use
by alternating these two products at nights my skin never looked better
thank you 20% off vib weekend
at almost 50 i was starting to pay the price for all of those sun worshiping years of my 20’s/30’s
i’m ready for my 2nd bottle
i put it on my face after my shower.
so at night i place a little algenist oil
a brief episode of a break out
the opening of the bottle is normal
found out that can use it every night
definitely have to wear sun screen during the day
brighter the next day
i can wear this every night
the first night when i used it
in the morning my face was really smooth
i am able to use every nite without any irritation at all
i am on my third bottle
usually just put this on at night with nothing else
when i wake up the next morning
when i woke up in the morning
with it peaking at 10 drops for my face every night
use it almost every night
used every night until i was finished with bottle then reviewed
this product at night
dirt at the end of the day
have you ever spent the day at the beach
which i did with this while waiting on my second bottle to arrive
it was winter when i first tried it
i wear it every night to bed
i did not notice any shine on my face throughout the day
i apply in the morning after washing my face
foundation during the day
my face stays oil free for the majority of the day
the end of the day my face is the same matte finish as the morning
i am on my second bottle now
at the end of my 10 hour work day i'm still looking fresh
my makeup stayed on perfect all day long
the first day i noticed results
i still need to touch up midday
i'll have to wait for the humid summer to return to really test that bit
its keeps the mid day shine away :
mattifies all day after morning application
does reduce the shine on my face that i usually get mid-day
on regular days i can skip it altogether
i will be making it a part of my daily skin care routine
powder throughout the day
i plan to use this on my "days in the house
i am not having to apply powder mid-day for my usually shiny t-zone
my face was matt through out the whole day
i also use this at night, too.
i spend a lot of time in the sun
with this moisturizer i am officially hooked on this product line
i wait about 20 minutes to let it absorb before putting on my makeup
i put it on after i was my face in the morning
again 20 min before i do my makeup
use it every day!
i am just now at that age when the wrinkles really start to show
at night i just put a little more on.
i put it on 20 to 30 minutes after my roc retinol at night before bed
then again in the morning
t jas prolonged my morning routine somewhat
my cheeks would start to feel tight after maybe an hour or two of applying
soft with no tightness until maybe an hour before i get home
takey makeup off which is many many hoirs later considering i work 12 hour shifts
this is my favorite cream to use at night.
was softer in the morning
i put this on at night before bed
in the morning my face is soft
ready for the day
i apply this at night now
am half way through
my face feels awesome when i wake up in the morning
i can put a primer on shortly there after
hot in the summer, very cold in winter.
especially for the winter
i live in a cold
use this everyday- morning
enjoy the morning fresh feel
this rescues me at the end of the day where it can really soak in before bed
i also use a little at night on my h
i mean within a week i started getting compliments on my skin again
hope in a jar during the day
i actually look forward to using this in the mornings
in the winter months i like a thick night cream
i wake up to a refreshed
which i use for daytime
i used this at night last winter then stopped over the summer-big mistake
you will add this product to your night time face routine
i started using this after reading a ton of reviews on it
i love that i can put it on before getting in the shower
normally after i was my face
then i finish the rest of my routine.
double cleaning each time
i go all out full face daily
when i get home from work at night i can't wait to take my makeup off with this
i've found the best way to use it is apply it 5-10 minutes before a shower to let it sit
its a must in my daily routine.
i even use this as a normal face wash in the morning or evening
sensation of rubbing off my makeup at the end of the day very relaxing
massage in around 20 seconds
repeat if double cleansing at night
i only use it at night!
while i am washing my face
i used this product last night
especially when i cleanse at night with my clarisonic
they were gone the next morning
after the 3rd night i am almost totally clear
especially around that fun time of the month
it broke me out hours after washing my face
started using it every morning
after using it everyday in the morning for about a week
clean at the same time
usually am breakout free
i can count on my face staying in a good balance all day
sometimes just in the morning
night i saw a reduction of at least 50%
i began having skin troubles after traveling to nyc for a week
i make this my nighttime face wash
morning around that time of the month as well
at first i saw my skin clear up within the first week of using it 2x/day
i used this wash twice a day
leaving it on for a minute or so each time
i used this one day
when i was in my early 20's i had the return of acne
twice a day on the weekends
once in the morning
i am going to be 37 this year
he no longer breaks out on a weekly basis
i wake up in the morning
night along with the spot treatment at night
then after about a minute i use it with a wet foreo with a focus on those areas in my t zone
now i am in my mid 40's
i wash my face @ nighttime then put it on
mom just to see...).i use it every morning.
looks glorious in the morning
so better at night
after i wash the serum off in the morning
the results from just the first night were just incredible
i saw her a week after that
use it only at night
so now i use the heavy one for night
about 3rd full week of use
i used 2 pumps twice a day
i woke up one morning
use ever 3rd day
because the life cycle of a cell is usually 28-30 days up til usually age 30 or so
cut down starbucks to once a week
on an overcast snowy day
if you choose to use it in the daytime as well as at bedtime
great for day to day use
it's light weight and i use it all year round.
i am almost through with my second bottle of this
even if i put it on at the beginning of the day
if i apply it at night
if i apply it in the morning
would normally be greasy by the end of the day
lately it has been quite oily every morning when i wake up
after a 9-5 work day i end up leaving the office a little shiny
i put this one before bed
it does not feel heavy after hours
i could start going back to my regular routine with serums within a week
every night when i wash my face
doesn't take up tons of room in the cabinet
just let it set in for about 10-15 minutes
i even use it as my moisturizer at night during the summer
with an oily t-zone year round
once in the morning
before bed after washing my face
i put it in the fridge at night after use
t's extra cooling in the morning
this guy will save you from a bad nights sleep
look like you slept for 9 hours
one night i gave it a try.
tube last the entire year with use each morning
i work strictly night shift
i apply at bedtime
in the morning before my normal eye cream
it is liike an evening treat for my eyes
i recently purchased this for my early mornings before work when i haven't slept well
what i use every morning.
i can usually tell the difference between mornings when i use it
very refreshing in the morning
would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to wake their eyes up in the morning
lasts throughout the day
i put this product in my everyday routine!
all about eyes at night
i also use in the morning on eyelids
alcohol the night before
is a welcoming part of my morning routine
perfect cooling sensation that helps wake me up in the mornings
it's very relaxing at the same time
i roll it on every morning before
i put this on before bed
look like a normal human instead of someone that's only had a few hours of sleep
it will take an hour or so to see results
every morning i wake up
sit in bed on my phone for 5 minutes
by the time i'm ready to start my routine
t before it becomes too late
i put it under my eyes first thing in the morning
use it usually once in the afternoon as well
i left my usual product at home
rested even after a rough sleep
apply to my under eye area throughout the day just waking up my tired eyes
i wake up early in the morning with huge puffy bags under my eyes
i don't know if it was the extra hour of sleep i got
i do like this as it feels really cooling to help with my tired eyes after long hours at a computer
by the time i am ready to jump in the shower
i got it around mid august
i woke up with normal
i am in my mid 40s
my face looked like i actually had a good night sleep
move on each night
just one application at night
even better after put on my night
this is just day 2
just tried this today after i got it in the mail.
if i wait 5 minutes or so before putting on my spf/make-up
putting this on morning
specially after one single night
in fact when i was driving in the morning
looked in the mirror the next morning
when i woke up the next morning i was floored
i only use it at night 4-5 times a week.
when i use it at night i put a light serum underneath it
when i use this at night
i look *good* the next day.
it is however, fabulous for nighttime (bedtime).
although i did not see results after the first day
my skin felt oiler than usual in the morning
i just continued with my normal routine for daytime
used this only at night
i used it the first night
it was dry at the same time
tired looking skin from working long hours
my makeup went on flawlessly the next day
usually when i use a face cream at night i wake up so greasy
i really love how my skin look every time i wake up in the morning
only needing to re- apply every 2 hours throughout the day
the sleeping jelly at night
i mostly use it at night
each morning after washing my face
i let it sit for a couple minutes before applying on make up
if i skip a night or two
i got a sample of this gem one day when i was strolling around sephora shopping around for a new moisturizer
lasts throughout the day
am looking to get a night cream now!
i mostly use it as a night cream
when i wake up in the morning my skin has a amazing glow i highly recommend this product
i can still feel it on my skin in the morning
even as a night cream
i don't feel greasy the next morning
plan to switch to the sorbet for summer once i finish this one
its great for morning
glow for a good 6 hours
after a week my skin is beautiful again
apply this when i wake up
when i go to bed
the best part is that i can actually go without makeup on the weekends
anytime i tried a different night cream my face would start peeling again
it's better to use this one at night
into the next day
put this on in the morning
even on a 5 hour plane ride
apply it once a day
i apply am/pm.
i am in my mid 40's
after trying bliss' "youth as we know it" night eye cream
i can get 5 hours of sleep
wake up looking like i just slept soundly for 10 hours
the second night of use was a charm
i look at a computer screen about 12 hours a day
after the first night the dryness is gone
both nice when getting ready quickly in the morning
by the next morning of my first use
at the end of the day the area around my eyes still look good
i like using this at night because i like a eye cream with a spf during the day
i work long hours in a stressful field
after very little sleep
getting ready for a long day
i am currently writing my master's thesis so three hours of sleep is customary these days
i dabbed a little on at night and it the morning.
it doesn't help that i end up short on sleep most night as well
it makes me look like i've had a full nights sleep
in the morning this is all i use
as i reach into my late 30s the morning puffiness started to get to noticeable
i do love it as a morning eye cream to wake up my eye area
use this at night
which is a plus if you're using it in the morning
i wake up every morning in a rush to go to work
i always use eye cream, morning and night.
i am in the sun a lot
it is a bit heavy for day time use in my opinion
great as an over night cream
non-oily even afer hours of wear
this is a must in my daily routine
i do remember the first night i put this on my skin
i woke up in the middle of the night feeling like a different person
i used just a small amount at night to make sure i got the best bang for my buck
on my chin during "that time of the month"
saw the difference the next morning
am on my second bottle
its also evening out my skin tone
i finally got the 1.7oz during the vib event!
woke up this morning to the prettiest skin i've had in years
while i alternate which products i put on afterward
tried it on a tuesday
now it's monday of the next week
literally every time i go home
i saw results in as little as 1 week.
i swear you'll notice your skin has changed in before the first week of am/pm use
another review for another day
another review for another day
my skin looks well rested in the morning
people started to comment on my skin in a week
i am 27 with oily skin and use this twice a day.
an spf during the day
i did break out within the 1st week
the results got better day by day
i get compliments on my skin every day
better textured the very next morning i used it for the first time
am under make up
saw results in the 1st week.
firmer skin after using nightly for a week
when i use this nightly
when i was putting it on in the morning
i apply it every day
basically every other day
people think i am in my early 40's at best
either during the day before makeup or at night before bed
i am now on my second bottle!
it also says to apply at bedtime
i am still in my early twenties
i put it on in the morning
at night after i wash my face
ready for my day or night cream
a lighter face wash in the morning
how can i go back after trying this cream to my old $20 night cream?
plan to order it tomorrow
mostly only at night
alternating with ks eye arrest on particularly dry evenings
i wake up looking refreshed
i tried leaving it on overnight
when i've cheated after a late night
breathing through my mouth til i fall asleep
i only use it at night
every morning when i wake up i see an improvement in my under eye area
my eyes feel so hudrated in the morning after
i did not realize how great this product was until i looked in the mirror one morning just before hitting the shower
i put this on every night before going to bed
i want one product that is going to address my dark circles when i am pulling an all-nighter of work
even after i wash my face in the morning
i put it on everyday
then immediately wash my h
i hear early 30s starts it
works all day even when used at night.
i fall asleep very fast
didn't even notice this morning
in the mornings under my makeup
it is the first product i put on my face in the mornings after washing my face
it lasts like 2 seconds
the odor would last about 10 minutes after putting on the eye cream
i forgot to use it one day
i am using this cream for my eyes both day
which is important to me because i’m always in a rush in the mornings
i just started using this last night
i gave it 4 stars because i only use 1 pump a day
it takes a little while to absorb in the morning
every day i put this on my face
i let it sit for about 5 minutes before applying the foundation
happy in the winter also keeps it from getting breakouts in the summer
no lines at the end of the day
on days when i'm feeling lazy
it lasts all day
my make up lasts all day
my face was greasy by mid-day
this is the only cream i buy for my face for the day time
i put it on every morning before makeup
if i break out during the day
lasts all day, as well!
actually used this at night time
begins to clear my skin overnight
it gets oily in t-zone in 2-3 hours after i wash my face
or get greasy in an hour
or make my face shine like a disco ball after 3-4 hours
keep my skin in the best condition at all times
i only use it as a night cream
my skin was clearing up the first time overnight.
it definitely helps cut down on the mid-afternoon oilies
in every other season
i also noticed that each day i would be more oily than the day before
i've extended my routine to a small h
the rest of the time
upper back after i workout
best used when face is clean in the morning.
if you use it in the pm you'll have to double cleanse
i found using this once a day was perfect for my skin
i still use it twice daily
usually in the morning
i still have to blot 1/2 way through the day
the first month it made my skin very dry in some places
i only use this as my second cleanse at night.
i ran out last semester
leave it on my face for a few minutes almost every day because it is so gentle
i used it before bed
alone in the morning -- it is cleansing
i've found a great place for this in my daily regimen
i also miss the way my old clinique soap was so refreshing at the end of my workday
after using this for a week at night
was instantly added to my morning/evening routine
tight all at the same time
which is great to use as part of my nighttime routine
i will definitely keep using this am / pm!
every day i see less
after using this at night i will wake up
is more like putting a clay mask on your face every day for a minute or two
on a recent trip to sephora one of the consultants did a demo of this on my face
i am planning on trying out the overnight serum with it
i am only on my second bottle
i do use something heavier at night
neck in the morning
it was like night
you can use it for day or night
i even wear this at night
when i got back home i did my nightly routine
every day for the rest of the week
also at night after i wash my face
soft in the morning
pair it with your favorite face wash for the perfect bed time routine
when to sleep n wake up with better skin
can apply my makeup immediately on top of it in the morning
when i apply it at night
i am turning 27 this year
after just one night
i don't just limit it to night time use
this product helps to calm my skin during the night
i just bought this product again for the second time as it is still a great nighttime serum
i never wake up with shiny skin in the morning
i used the clearasonic brush every night with my regular face wash
the best is when i wake up in the morning
sometimes in the morning
i look forward to applying it every evening
it takes me to bed every night.
sometimes i wear it during the day too.
i always break out every time my menstrual cycle comes into town
i saw results after using it everyday
i loved how my make up applied the morning after using this mask
i always leave it on for an hour while watching tv at night after shower
i used it every other day until a ran out
will continue using it every night
i used it in the evening
the next day it was like i had a mini sun burn
stays on all day
i apply it after i wash my face in the morning
this is my daily go-to
as far as evening skin tone
in the morning before i put on makeup
i originally bought it to actually use it at night before hitting the sheets as my skin is combination/oily
let it soak in for a couple of minutes
then went on with my usual makeup routine
by the end of the day
especially in the winter
i apply this in the morning
i apply just a tad more at night before i got to sleep
in for my day cream
i only use it in the day
i usually put it on at night
if you wear it during the day
makes me feel awake when i apply it in the morning
i tried this at the store the other day after walking in the sun for a while
especially when i put it on in the morning
not only does last until my night routine
this is my go-to day cream
for now, this is a staple in my morning routine.
so i would only wear it at night.
a sun block is needed year round
i find that if i use this in the morning
one application at night is all i need
not oily when i wake up the next morning
after one use overnight my face looked fresh
after the first day i was not impressed
by the 3rd day i could see fine lines deminishing
i used this after every time i washed my face
usually one drop each time before my repairware uplifting cream
again at night mixed with tarte's maracuja oil
the days that i don't leave the house the serum is the only item i have used on my face
get mistaken for late 20s all the time
at night i wear it with a clinic eye cream on top
if i go to the beach or park i wear an additional spf 40 in the eye area
cold when i put it on in the morning
for face at night
t will last all day
use a little retinol at night then go over it with the fresh line
as i am on the second jar
at the same time
i am on my second bottle
i started using it at night only.
this morning i decided to try it
after just one night
you can go a little heavier at night
during the day only on my undereye area
then i use the black tea one during the day
just give yourself plenty of time in the morning or might be good for some as an evening eye cream
i also use it on drier mornings
great for am &/or pm routines.
dry during the winter
if i'm extra dry i'll use it in the morning before my makeup application as well
when i wake up
it's light enough for me to use it during the day during colder months
i've used it day and night this entire winter.
i am getting ready to purchase my 4th jar.
which i used up the following day
perfect for the next morning
morning/to revive makeup during the day/night
makeup before a night out
after using it before bed my skin feels really soft in the morning
after the third night
this is a go-to refresher for day or night.
brighter in the morning
f you plan to wear during the day
i apply it in the morning before makeup
at night before bed
felt dryer within a week
i like to use it before bedtime
i wear it at night
smooth in the morning
fresh after i use this
i only use one pump in the morning
night for the next week or so
i wouldn't use it morning
it's nice to put on right before make up in the morning then use a lighter moisturizer at night
it works day or night or before make up
winter with the addition of a face mist in winter time
decided to try it one night before bed
when i woke up in the morning it was like a whole new face
'd use this at night
i did go to the snowy mountains for a few days
use it during the day
perfect for end of day
i decided to try this out at night
needed time to soak in overnight
i woke up the next morning
my skin is visibly healthier after only using it a short time every morning
i also put it on at night
i only use at night
i now use it every day in the morning
just plan on waiting a few minutes before you go to bed or your pillow gets the cream
applied it after my shower
after using this in the morning
i put this on every night
manageable in the morning when i put on my makeup
double up in cold weather
let it sit for a few minutes
so after i wash my face at night i always apply this
for that i use a different one at night.
in the morning i wake up to beautiful skin
see the difference in the morning after using this at night
definitely look more awake after using.
i apply a very small amount after i wash my face at night
after about a month of applying this every morning
left me feeling refreshed for a full 24 hours
i find that the best use is using it at night after you cleanse
let sit for 30s before make up application
i looked exhausted even after a lot of sleep
i apply it at night
in the morning before i use philosophy's hope in a tube eye cream
after using it for 2 nights i knew i needed to purchase it
mainly used this at night.
this is the one i love for morning
when i wake up in the morning i have a smooth canvas
i used both day and night.
i usually don't have a ton of time in the morning
heavy by the end of the day
that's with twice-a-day usage
i put it on before bed
when i wake up
then putting it on in the mornings
the pot lasts about 2-3 months if you use it morning

i personally put it on at night before i go to sleep
my skin gets try this time of year
i initially was at a duty free store to try on the new bobbi brown bb cream
i used the whole thing up on vacation!
lasts all day without sliding off by mid day
now it's part of my every day routine
i held off on another purchase for a long time
a nose that could power a small country with oil by early afternoon
every morning i apply it over a clean face
which is great to start off your day
when i first looked at this creme
yes i do get a bit shiny after a couple of hours
kept my makeup in place all day
i love it for day and night though.
my face will be really dry in the morning with my face shiny by 1pm
if i have a dry spot i can just put this on before i go to bed
really wakes me up in the morning
i love it so much that i started using it as my day/night moisturizer
i love this and i use this morning and night.
i can encounter a full day at work
perfect as a morning wake-up
plus my makeup looks as good at 5pm as it does at 7am
this is probably the 4th day i've used it
cold weather in winter
just save this product for my nighttime routine
i put this on morning
i double up at night
use it morning and night.
use a little at a time
i am flying this week

in the morning i rinse it off
even the next morning my skin feels firmer than before i started using this product
in the morning after cleansing
a face-lift for 2-4 hours after used as directed
just remember to let it dry for about 10 minutes
i put it on before i shower
do not think its a quick fix the night of an event for the first time
an hour later, my face remains tight.
i think nightline for 60 minutes
soon after this application
i sobbed for the next hour or so nonstop
i apply this as soon as i get up in the morning
you are set for the day
firming action stays with me all day
the next day i went on line
this stuff lasts about 8 hours per application on me
when i found out the price at the register
i apply this in the morning
just after one week my skin is not dry
woke up the next morning with glowing skin
i will use it alone at night after a shower
daily in the morning

which means to keep up this routine is to spend 40$ a month on moisturizer
my eyes were watering for hours.
best for summer season.
make-up ready minutes after applying
i get compliments on my skin every other day
i apply this product morning
i wear this every morning
use this every night
my face looks so much more awake after i apply this

i remember i go this in my play box last month
the product was pilling up on my face for about a week
in the mornings my face is soft
am in my late 20's
holds up great for daily pool exercise sessions!
i only get about 15-20 minutes of sun exposure a day
although i wear it every day
use it in the daytime only
my skin tone is evening out.
i apply it in the morning before i go out
out in the sun daily and looking better!
the spots are starting to show again
i let it soak in for 10 minutes before applying foundation
i am no longer worried about the daily being out in the sun
spent the day in the sun without putting on additional sunscreen
i am approaching 40 next year
had 4 days of gloomy sun free weather
i apply in the am wait 15 mins then apply makeup
i get dressed after i put this on
a lighter one in the morning
i put it on in the morning
i tried it for the first time this morning
rubbing it around both eyes when you wake up in the morning
after i take it off in the evening before bed
when i lack sleep or look for a way to awake my face
even after long nights
i apply this product both before bed
in the morning before my regular make up routine
even after a long day at work
no more then 5 hours of sleep
i always wake up in the morning with poofy
/or pm because it needs at least a good 10 minutes of complete drying adherence

sometimes i get up in the morning
refreshed before having coffee

i apply it in the morning
once in the morning
i usually wake up in the mornings with pretty puffy
whether i've slept 8 hrs or 5
i can see the difference every morning
not being a morning person this really helps wake me up as i'm getting my am makeup routine started
on days when i haven't gotten much sleep
i cant leave the house in the morning without this thing
i only used it in the morning
to start off my day
smooth all day/night
the pm after cleaning my face
one day i decided to actually use it when i ran out of my regular moisturizer
one day i ran out of my regular moisturizer i was using at night
let alone twice a day
dry during the winter
i put it on at night before bed
this morning it is almost completely gone
then used the rest of it at night
when it says 24-hour hydration it really means 24 hours
i put it on one day without make-up
i found that during the two week trip it didn't cause any breakouts
now that i'm back in my humid home state i use it every day around my eyes
i apply it in the morning
use it morning & night !
i added this to my order last minute
tried every other night
i actually use this one before bed
this morning when i woke up my face still felt baby soft
not sure how it will work for mornings in the summer months
it's literally my favorite part of my morning routine
i typically only use this in the morning.
even into my late twenties
also oily mid-day
especially for morning use
soft at the same time
this became my holy grail for my night time routine
only on special occasion
it has diminish it in two nights
don't spend a lot of time in sun
i noticed it immediately the next morning after one application
caused mini breakouts for a week or 2 until my skin adjusted
if i am this happy after only 4 days of use?
it is light enough for morning application
this takes about 15-20 minutes to work
if i don't get at least 8/9 hours of sleep a night
i only use it at night about 3x a week
darkness under my eyes waking up most mornings
every time i finish a bottle of this
again after the 1st
2nd month of using this morning
this is the best night cream out there
then again in the morning
i ordered the product that day in the holiday set
i only apply before bed
have at least another 7 days of product @2x/day
inside you will find at least another week
once i finish that, i'll use this in the day too.
only use it at night
i used less than a pump for both eyes at night
i am still in search for that perfect all around cream
through out the day
every time i go back
use it before going to bed
this creme does the job at night
i wear this in this in the eve because i feel like i'm treating it to a special treat after a long day
i love waking up to a fresh
rejuvenated face in the morning
i used it daily until it was gone
i wear it every day.
works wonders for a day out in the sun.
this cream is perfect for the cold winter days!
i first bought this to wear in the summer.
after cleansing at night
my skin gets dry during the day
since i'm closing in on 50
i wear it during the day
i love this cream for both day & night!
i am now using the benefiance wrinkleresis24- night cream
more vibrant every morning after i use this product
one constant in her bags is this day cream
soft all day long
have to try the night cream next time i order
great for day and night use.
i am in my early 30's
within an hour after putting this cream on i noticed a difference
as i apply it at night time anyways
it the morning after i wash my face
i put it on in the morning
when i used this at night
even though i apply this at night
at the end of a long work day
then one morning when i was out of my usual eye cream i reached for it
to stretch it out even further i only use it in the morning
every time i use it it looks like i got 9 hours of sleep- when i didn't
will instantly wakes you up
put it on every evening
i used it everyday twice a day
this is the first to provide moisture all day-- i can touch my outer eye area in the afternoon
from the first night i used it i saw a difference
it was a hot day
it's best on weekends
i used it morning
if you use this both morning
only in the morning before makeup
i am really enjoying the soothing effects it has each time i apply in the am
i only apply at night
my skin was staying dry for days.
:) i use it at night after i wash my face.
if i wait til the next vib 20% off sale
my skin would stay oil-free for a good 12 hrs
dry when i neglect using this product for the night
to only apply this at night
or maybe this line needs night cream
plus every time i put it on i feel like i'm at the spa :
just got another today
may place another tomorrow
i've never paid so much for night cream before in my life
i generally only use this at night or when i'm not planning on wearing makeup during the day
at least when its warm out.
at least for my skin.
while waiting for a new one to arrive i tried this out
i put it on before bed
i also apply it in the morning as part of my daily routine
off for quite sometime now
i look younger and fresh and it lasts all day.
i usually have to wait half an hour before putting on my make up as i'm more of a bronzer
i saw a transformation in my skin after the 3rd day
other seasons, winds blow on average at 150km/hr.
this product gets me thru every single day of whatever the weather
i put it on mornings and evenings.
when i woke up the next morning i was amazed at the texture
i love my skin in the morning
said i could use during the day or night
you have to religiously use it during the morning
night to give my skin a boost
i didn't mind it at all since i put on a creme afterward
next morning after the mask i love my skin
it probably holds off oil in my t-zone for a good 6 hours before i have to blot
i wear it alone morning
applied it before go to bed
before makeup in the am i put this on before base
i do only use this product once a day in the morning
dry skin at night
only use it at night instead of twice a day
worth the money directions say morning
when i did that i noticed some white heads the next day
night on clean face
's eyes going to them when we were in daylight
only if i use it at night before bed
in the morning before i apply my makeup
it says to put on day
i only do it at night
after my first application of this product i saw results
i am in my early 20's
i put this on last night after washing
this morning i woke up
it's amazing how just adding this before my face lotion in the morning
after a tough workout session or two
signature cream every night , and in that order.
i normally use this over a retin a type product followed by another light night cream
i am just about to finish my first jar of this
just use a little each night.
refreshing in the morning
night as part of my waking
every night for awhile
i hear early 30s starts it
night on top of cold plasma for about a month
instead i skip a night
i am back on it, probably on my 6th bottle.
also the daytime with spf i wear daily.
am starting to see fine lines
after using this on a 5 week vacation in denver for the winter i am a total algenist convert
after the 2nd day of using this my forehead
i am literally on the 10th day
even on a 4 hour sleep schedule
did my own 2 week test
just use a little bit at night after i wash my face
i love using this with their night cream.
then apply your am or pm cream
on average 25-30h/week of sleep
i am getting ready to order my 3rd bottle.
try it with the overnight cream
i do not use it in the morning
after washing my face in the evening
the next morning my skin was so even in color
i saw a differnce in my skin the next day
when i used it i immidiately saw results
i put it on twice a day after cleansing
i could see a difference in 24 hours
i put this on every night after i wash my face
i started to see results on the second week.
night use in addition to their day cream
i am going to purchase the night cream
i do it morning
change your pillowcases every 3 days or so especially during hot summer months to keep acne away
using nightly/ every other night you won't regret it
even after applying it the first night
apply that to all of my face in the morning
started using it daily
i love this cream in the summer
there were algenist's reps at the store saturday
it sat in my medicine cabinet for a couple of weeks until one night my face felt a little dry after my shower
been using it every night.
leave it on all day
the girls at sephora even noticed a difference when i came in the next time
none is left on my pillow at night
the evening application feels like it works all night because when i wash my face in the am
i am in my early 30's
light at the same time
just put it on lightly during the day
must use retin a at night
not too heavy in summer
i only wash my face at night
only use this at night as well
will be giving the night cream a try as soon as my perricone runs
my morning routine goes like this:
i unexpectedly spent the night at a friend's house
when stormy conditions made it safer to stay at her house instead of driving home
since i ended up spending much of the next day at her house
put this on at night
do use it during the day
i picked up a regular jar at the sephora near me today
i pair it with algenist's night serum before i go to bed at night
one of my favorite things is putting on this cream at night before i go to bed
i woke up after the first night of using this
since i was stay late every night
despite not getting much sleep
i started using morning and night.
especially before i go to bed
only use it at night
i woke up after the first night of using this
i can tell the next morning
i saw amazing results the very next morning
stays put all day till you wash it off
for those times when no sleep
i imagine on a normal day
they didn't return to their early morning state.
i put it on the first day
let it dry a minute or two
in just minutes after applying this gel to the eye area
it made me look like i had a good nights sleep.
at the 1st time i used it
then wait 5 minutes before putting on my makeup
by evening my eyes have zero bags under them
let it dry for 5 minutes
i wear it every day
i went in one day
i got this on friday
used it saturday morning
mportant to wait about 5 to 10 minutes to let it set
without warning after a minute or so
continue with your make-up routine
it's a very nice pick me up for those early mornings when i need a little help looking more awake
if i use it first thing in the morning
just be sure to wait a few minutes after using it before doing your makeup prep
end up making my t-zone look oily within a few hours
once in the morning
once in the afternoon
i still have to touch up at midday
that's nothing compared to using blotting papers every hour like i did before
this also does not sweat off when you sit outside in the heat at a baseball game all day
stays on all day
so this morning was the first time i tried it
people regularly think i am in my early 30's
the finish can st
i go all day without having to use blotting papers
use it every day
every time i put this on
i put it on at 7am
it's still going strong by7pm
oil free for the entire day
i also normally have an oily t-zone withn about 3 hours
it lasts all day
and i had an hour and a half dance class!!
make sure to wash off at night.
i usually leave it on a minute or two prior to washing it off
takes the day off
originally purchased because i forgot my face wash at home for a weekend getaway
on days i wear make up
i notice that with this cleanser i only use my clarisonic 1-2 times weekly now
makeup would slide off my nose within an hour or so
first i use this oil then i go in with my murad time release cleanser
at night after work as a nurse
let it sit for a minute while i put my pjs on
i wake up in the morning
so far the heavier night time oil
let it soak for a few minutes
my face was in shock due to the cold winter weather
after one night of using my set
so this is perfect for daytime
until i found this
the softness of your face will last the entire day
normally i'll see a breakout happen by the end of the first day
discovered this on vacation when the daily sunblock i got for my face caused a massive breakout
i put this on before bed
when i woke up
after cleansing in the morning
now i use it every morning
neck in the mornings
each jar lasts me about 2/3 months depending on how regular i am with my skin care routine
or spf on "outside" days
i put it on before bed
i love using this at night.
i apply it at night after cleansing
just tried this on fresh skin after i left the beach yesterday at one of benefit's stores
put it on at night
i put it on very generously before bed
when i wake up
almost like a day at the spa
it will always be my go to winter/fall/spring lotion
looks after using this every night
it's a little heavy for every day use during the summer
sometimes i'll wear it twice per day
so after washing my face at night
the first morning after trying this
i love this stuff use it in morning and night
it lasts all day
i ordered it around the beginning of july
i now use it as a night cream too
i also use this during winter times when my skin is dry
put this on before i went to bed
healthy the next morning
its part of my daily face routine.
i apply it right before bed
it made my whole day!
i live in a place that gets three feet of snow a month
i put it on before sleep
kept it on overnight
i shower in the morning before going to work
soft in the morning
i only use in the nighttime
only need this in the late fall/winter/early spring when it is very dry
i tried this cream for the first time today in a store
use it in the morning as well
then apply benefit total moisture all over before bed
can be used day or night
it is now the 1st thing i put on every morning
one morning i forgot to put it on
i generally use it at night before bed
when i wake up in the morning
definitely for the night
soft for the whole day
especially in the winter
before i go to sleep
before i go to bed at night
i used it last week without any face make up on
i put it on after i wash my face at night
after about 4 days of am/pm use
i love it and getting a jar of it this weekend.
10 minutes after i put this on before bed my dark circles were noticeably lighter
if i stop sleep late
before i go to sleep
i apply it every night under my eyes.
get by on 4-5 hours of sleep tired eyes
i can't wait to see the results in a month!
i used it before bed
every morning i wake up
once it starts to work
my eyes feel refreshed even hours after putting it on
if anything, i get less sleep on the weekends.
then i remembered that i switched to it's potent on the weekends
on nights where i stay up late
am using morning and night.
work before sleep again
the sample lasted me monday-saturday using it morning
used it during a visit
i apply at night that way when i wake up they are ready to be prepped with concealer ect
i like using it as my eye cream during the day.
apply lightly in the morning
brought a different kind of eye cream on a trip due to it's travel size for one week
i put it on before bed last night.
this morning my face looks 100% better.
this works well on my face as a night cream
i can tell when i've missed the step in my morning routine
after using this product every night before bed for a week
this is a great cream to be used at night.
let it soak in for a couple of minutes
i only use it at night
amazing effects-after a couple of days of using it nightly around my eyes the lines have rolled back to what they were in my early 20s
i am on my second bottle of this product.
which isn't a problem since i only use this at night
i put it on my face right after my morning shower
after washing my face at night
for the first time since my early teens
started using it morning
i put this on for the first time
i don't wake up with that tired "raccoon" look in the morning anymore
t makes my eyes look a bit more well-rested the next morning
way better than sleeping for an age and a day.
missing maybe 5-8 applications a month when i get lazy/busy
i plan to at least finish the bottle before writing this product off
every use after that
my "observation" is that when you don't use it for about a night to two nights
i usually use it in the morning
something different at night
every day twice a day
i apply it every night before bed
when i apply this at night
the next morning i wake up fresh-faced no matter how little sleep i got
use this at night only
use another eye cream in the morning
i look like i've slept 6 hours instead of 2 hours
i like it especially in the morning
found it by chance browsing in the store on day
i found the best results after i leave it on overnight
especially when i am low on my beauty sleep
leave it on for about 3-5 minutes
then go in the shower with it
i used this for the first time tonight.
great for every day use.
and it's a great wake me up in the mornings.
a perfect pick me up in the morning.
always compliments at the additional glow i get the next day
t lasts a while for me
probably about 6 times instead of my usual morning cleanser
i looked in my every day mirror
this is a part of my daily skin routine
t will last a while
t's nice to use in the morning shower
twice a week is all u need
when i start getting peely i use this at night
i don't want to wake until my night-time routine to remove everything
anyways because of this i've switched over to using it only at night
i definitely notice when i skip a day.
i've used it every day
perfect under a day cream or for night.
every morning my skin has looked a little more radiant than the day before
threw this on the morning
caught myself in the bathroom mirror a few hours later
healthy when i wake up in the morning
i just started using it at night too
i love how my face looks energyze when i wake up in the morning
i went without makeup for the first time on vacation
because after daily use
it was looking red during the day
use concentrate for 7 nights
normal skin in the summer
i'll be good for the rest of the day
stays on all day
one morning i woke up
it is a must have for those "late nights
even with applying morning
i only use this in the day.
it wakes me up in the morning
which is to be used at night
i only use this for daytime
i will save my shiseido eye cream for nighttime only
give it a try, apply every morning.
am amazed with the results i am achieving in such a short period of time
perfect for my am routine
heavy enough to last all day/overnight
i apply it before bed every night
i look forward to using it every single night
i also use this in conjunction with my clarisonic which is a match made in heaven
love this wash for my morning routine.
i am now so relived since finding this face wash.
can get slightly oily in the t-zone area during the hot summer days
the last stage of my cleansing routine
i wash my face with this each night
even in the winter
i am in my late 30's
i woke up one morning
i put it on morning and night.
i put it on after i take my make-up off before bed
then before i apply my make-up in the morning
at first when i used it
one day while i was in a sephora
i am in my early 30's
works well at night
started using this eye cream once a day at night for a week
re-apply mid day
using it every morning
it feels so soft minutes after application
once in the morning lasts the day
i only use it in the morning
in which case i'll wear it at night
so i use it only at night.
got up this morning
i've only used a little of the cream per night
so glad, i found it before winter sets in.
massage it into your dark spots religiously twice a day
definitely part of my daily routine
5-2 weeks i began to see the spots lighten
after developing dark spots on my face from prior years in the sun
i did use religiously morning
then apply this at nighttime
a tad bit in the morning before putting makeup on
sun exposure last spring
that was until i visited a lunch spot i regularly go to
my plan is to continue with this regimen until the de-spot runs out
i will be going on vacation in 2 weeks
i would reccommend waiting at least 10 mins after applying in the a
walk around in my sweats
the first night i used it
see the final results
i woke up this morning with the option of not wearing makeup bc my spots have lightened up so much
i originally planned on using this only for my h
until i found this.
at the two week point i started barely using any concealer at all
i am praying that the results will continue
massaging it in for a minute or two is a treat at the end of a hard day
my makeup had been on since 8 am the prior morning
just one use of it made my skin glow like no tomorrow
if i one day i had the chance
am on my third jar
30 seconds later i was really for bed
even the next morning
use it as a morning or a second cleanse
irritated during the winter
use it almost every other evening
massage it for about 20 minutes
i wouldn't use it during summer
leave on at night
will use them until the day i die
when i wake up the next morning after cleansing at night
finally decided to try it tonight with my clarisonic
if i use it twice a day
using that at night
this in the morning
especially during the winter
i also use in the shower in the am with my clarisonic
leave it on 1-2 minutes cleanse it
wash my face 4 times in one day
in the morning by itself
immediately after my first wash
i am mid 30's with skin that breaks out like i am young
so for me it will be a 4 star morning cleaner.
at first i used it at night.
put it on at 6:30 am
still looks good at 9:00 pm
am using it everyday since then
i apply it as my night cream
at night use the genius ultimate anti-aging cream at night
or use it after an intensive mask or anytime of the day or night without fear of my skin freaking out
i changed my nightly routine
i am using it morning and night.
it is perfect for morning when you are going to add makeup on top

i notice results after one night.
i started using it every night

use it the night before all of my big events
refreshed when i get up in the morning
skin feels amazing in the morning after washing off
after first trying it out with a sample overnight
after just one application over night

when i wake up in the morning my skin is baby soft

a very unique mask that you put on before bedtime
wash off the following morning
not a bad way to start a day.
the first time i used this i woke up to smooth
supple when i woke up this morning
received yesterday, used last night.
i even used it earlier this evening before applying face powder
i started using this after realizing i needed a different nighttime moisturizer than the one i was using during the day
especially in the winter time.
i put it on after washing
working throughout the night
i wake up to soft
you will wake up the next morning to a soft
when i wear this at night
i wouldn't recommend using it during the day
when i use it at night
i used this product during the day and at night.

i am anxious to see how a week turns out of using the same routine
my face feels great in the morning when i use this cream
the first morning after my face was so smooth
first time every using clinique
when i woke up in the morning it felt even better

the best night cream i've ever tried.
when i wake up
this makes me feel fresh when i wake up in the morning
i feel a difference for the entire day afterwards
this is my first night using it
i used it once the next morning i had forgotten i put it on the night before i looked at my face
i recently went without the tunaround night moisturizer for 5 nights
i apply it on my clean face at night
i used it last night under the treatment oil
when i woke up this morning
my face is comfortable all night
is not dried out in the morning
made my make up go on more evenly in the morning
i woke up the next morning
this cream took care of them overnight
i just skip a day or two
bright in the morning
its a little heavy for me in the summer
put nothing in it until i got a sample of this night cream
i used this moisturizer only for a few days at night
i started using this as the third step when i wash my face at night
this is now a staple in my nighttime routine
i put this on nightly after washing my face.
because i use it as a night cream
even after a good face washing that morning
is more normal throughout the day after wearing at night
just bought this as my first official night cream

when i wake up
i wake up every morning with my skin feeling plump
i started using this cream at night during the summer
dull skin during the night
i woke up the first morning after using it
now that winter is upon us i found myself waking up with tight dry skin after applying this cream at night
i am definetly going to start using it again once the warm weather is back
this one is just right for the current cold season
so you get new cell turnover while you sleep
dry on the outside
the next morning my skin is just so soft
this is perfect after a cleansing before bed
i began using this moisturizer several months ago when the winter winds started to wreak havoc on my face
bring on the snow!
look great in the morning
now everyday i wake up
in the summer time i had a layer of oil on my face in the morning
when i first tired this night cream i was in love
every morning when i wake up
i've gotten into this routine at night
"plump" in the morning
i wake up with my face looking refreshed
every morning when i look at my skin
depending on the time of day
i used this in my morning and night time routine.
clense my face before bed
they had it in store on the st
or bed this is it
i'll check when i get home tonight.
for the nights when i'm in a lazy mood
i love using it in the morning as a way to wake up
use it every night
night it lasts my husb
i usually use this after the gym or when i have super light makeup on/ no sink around
i also use it in the morning before working out

refresh your face anytime
i noticed that my undereyes were less puffy after using this product in the mornings
instantly wakeup my eyes
i did use it morning
now i just use it in the morning
i incorporated it into my morning routine
i wake up early for work
this is the first time i've used an eye cream on a regular basis
coffee extracts really do have a "wake you up" effect in the morning
i used this one night before bed
after a week of using this each morning
just made you feel more awake overall
because i can put on make up right after in the mornings
prefer to use it in the morning
i feel like it wakes me up in the morning
it's an excellent eye cream day and night!
it's a great addition to my morning routine.
as a mom it helps give me that awake look on only a few hours of sleep
i only apply it in the morning
helps wake my eyes up in the morning!
now i use it in the morning
i love using it in the morning to remove any tiredness
i instantly felt more awake upon applying it
i used it last night
this is quickly becoming my go to in the mornings
it helps my dull eyes brighten up after a long 12 hour night shift as a nurse
after working night shift
am a first time mom to a 7 month old that has yet to grasp the concept of sleeping through the night
i try to remember to use this every morning or at least before applying makeup
in my early 20s
as if i had several good night sleeps
i woke up the next day after use
use this when i wake up in the mornings so my eyes don't look that tired
every morning use it when waking up
it helps wake me up in the morning
one bottle lasts me a while.
i can use this wash twice a day
i can't go a morning or night without using this facewash
about me: i'm in my mid-30's
i start to use this.
or preparing to go to sleep
before this product i could go about 2 hours after makeup
good for early morning risers since it wakes you up
s nice enough to use at night
at night before i go to bed
like greasy by the end of the day
it was a great eye opener first thing in the morning
i like to use it at night with my foreo
ard evening cleanser for about a year now
the first night i used origins
when i woke up the next morning
which is why i usually use it at night
put it on my problem spots in the evening
it lasts me a while
i also follow up with a little bit of their night a min oil ten minutes after i put on the acne treatment to help it
then 30-60 minutes later i'll put on the night a min moisturizer
i used it twice a day at first in the morning
i began to use it once a week after i noticed that it was clearing my dark spots
they'll be vanished by morning at this rate!
it did dry up my skin for the first week of use
apply during night time to see results the next day
i've had it for about a week now i put it on my dark spots
it is a spot treatment after all
i always apply before i go to bed
just apply one day before
preferably the night before
in the morning nothing will be there
i notice the best results when i put it on before bed
'd recommend using at night
i apply the gel at night
by the time i wake up
i just use a little on each problem acne area before i go to bed
this knocks them out in about 24 hours
this isnt a product that will work over night
i'll put it on in the morning
i will notice a difference by the afternoon
or if i put it on at night
it will be gone by morning
i put it on before i went to bed
woke up the next day
it works over night
i found if i only put it on after i shower
i just got this in the mail from the last day of the vib sale
soft the next morning
you could use it morning
i only use it at night time before going to bed.
this is my must-have for mornings
now i am on my second week
i find the cream a little on the heavy side for day use
i wear this every night, all year.
not too heavy in summer
after using it the first night
let it sit for a couple of minutes before you put on makeup
it's my favorite night and daytime cream.
summer for me too
i can only use this product at night
will see how it holds up during the montreal winter
i only use it pm 4 times a week because the other 3 days i use my acne treatment
i love putting this on my face day
i will use it until it runs out
then if i skip it in the morning
doesn't get oily until late afternoon
when usually it's late morning when that happens
i do use it as a night cream before bed
i put this on before my day/night cream for an extra layer of moisture
when i wake up in the morning my skin feels soft
i just relax when i put it on
i would love to use this twice a day after cleansing
it immediately begins to calm
during summer when my face gets oily
preparing my face for whatever comes next
when i touched my face mid-afternoon
i'll touch my face at the end of the day
've been slacking on my night time routine lately
soft in the morning
i am sure you could use any cream for morning or night

the perfect eye cream for people in their early 20's
at night since the weather has made my skin really dry
this is my day time eye cream
which i've worn every day since high school
about2 hours after putting on makeup
even after a month of origins zero oil i woke up with hydrated
it's a part of regular face routine.
i usually use this in the morning
the oil-free effect doesn't last all day though
is amazing to use in the am before putting my make up on
when you use it for the second time
soft after every use
continues throughout the day
even throughout the day
it washes away the products that i used the night before
i am now treating it during the day as well
even after washing my face at night
20 minutes after makeup application
in the morning i'm not oily
by mid-day i do see oil on my t-zone
i love using it as my morning cleanser before i put on my makeup to help keep the shine away throughout the day
shine free all day
i noticed my makeup was smearing by early afternoon each day
i started using this the first day i got it.
i tried it again tonight with a face sponge
even if i skipped a day
breaks down my makeup after a long day/night
it is so cooling on a 102 deree summer day
sometimes sleep with it on
i also used this every other day when i was on accutane
comfortable each time after use
glowing throughout the day
decided to try the overnight one
i leave it on over night.
left it on for 10 minutes
so good to use during the winter
even though it says to leave it on for 10 minutes
had 3 days till it arrived so
almost everyday during winter
i left it on overnight
i put in on for about 20 minutes
i noticed that the next morning
after using this mask the night before
leave it on for the entire flight
i also use it in the winter.
i like to do this at night
i love to do this drink up in the morning
especially on days of special occassion
before putting on my morning skincare
which is fine if being used at night
i love that it only takes 10 minutes.
this did just that -- after just a couple nights of using this my skin looked so soft
i also use this weekly during the wintertime.
s before i go to bed at night
t could stay on all day
by afternoon i was already having dry
heavy hitting hydration in 10 minutes flat.
this can be left on all day/night or used as a treatment on dry patches
when i wake up the next morning my skin is smooth
my video is on the overnight version
especially in the summertime
i am on my 4th day with this product
this mask is my favorite during the winter when my skin is dry or when i have been outside on a windy day
i used this the first time after a winter's day hiking
after 10 minutes my skin is dewy soft for the rest of the day
i also leave my mask on overnight
when i wake up in the morning
my face feels great the next morning
abosrbs enough that i can use in the morning before
great to use at night in dry weather
i put on night cream as usual
especially during the winter
since i don't have enough time to do a 10 minute mask in the morning
i put some on trouble spots every night before bed
it does reduse the shine on my face through the day
use this both in the morning
good for day and night.
as we're switching from winter/spring to
i apply this before bed
at first it stops oils but not for the whole day.
my skin is oil free at the end of the day
apply it twice a day and i'm good to go.
i still get breakouts around my period
at the end of my 8hr day
only use it either in the morning or the evening
especially in the summertime
i find best results using it at night before bed.
i wake up with clearer skin every time :)
perfect for daytime use in the summer
love that my face it still matte when i wake up in the morning
when wearing during the day
i am on my second bottle
light but lasts all day!
i am noticing that i can get an 8 hour wear out of my foundation
by the end of the day
good for a little pick me up on morning skin.
i applied it after washing my face at night
did not think much of it since i typically don't apply anything on my face until mid day on saturday/sunday
now it's mid day monday
if you put it on at the beginning of the day your face is less shiny at the end of the day
on the coldest week they had so far this winter
in the morning under my make up
therefore i only put it on at night after washing with the origins face wash
it is a staple in my daily routine!
i spend a couple of hours a day at the gym
get oily throught out the day on my t-zone
in the morning before i put my makeup on
i tried this last night for the first time
waking up this morning
try to use it overnight
this is my 3rd night using the mask as an all night spot treatment
will keep working after 10 minutes
i tried it for the first time last night
when i woke up this morning all my acne was reduced by a l
this is my second night trying it.
told me to leave it on overnight
wash it in the morning since it's only on two or three problem spots
i used it in the evening
even the morning after i did the mask
i usually use it as part of my nighttime routine
was clearer the next morning
use this at night
tonight i am using it as a spot treatment
just a couple of tiny spots that i'm sure will be gone tomorrow
when i use it at night
you can leave it on for an hour
the first time i put it on
i wash my face each day
all of that regular routine
just wash it off in the morning
sometimes when i feel like my skin is about to break out i immediately put this on during the night time
let it stay on my face for the entire night
to leave the mask on for 10 minutes
i break out really bad around my monthly time
i kept it on over night
i would leave it on overnight
i left it on for 45 minutes
if i put it on at night
i used this mask seriously once a day
i noticed after leaving it on my face for about 20 minutes
i leave it on for about 15-20 minutes every other night
also as an overnight spot treatment
i keep it on for 20 minutes
perfect for relaxing at night
it's part of my weekly routine
decided to do it on a whim last night
wow i woke up this morning with amazingly calm skin
you'll feel better in the morning.

i used this one night
i saw results in the morning
colour by the time i wake up the next day
i also use it as a spot treatment before bed.
used it each day under my make up

at night, one full pump.
right now i am only using it at night
i used the 2 products last night
when i wake up in the morning after applying at night

usually i only use one pump in the morning
it wakes me up in the morning

the cooling sensation is a plus after a hot shower on a cold morning
gives me a nice healthy glow when i wake up in the morning
this will be perfect for the summer

before i go to bed
it will not leave much oil on my face even in the afternoon
every day necessity for me.
drinking alcohol almost every day of the vacation

especially for night time
i do use it twice a day.
during the winter i sometimes use the plantscriptions eye cream with it at night
i used it morning & night faithfully.
the eye cream at night
tighter around my eyes when i wake up in the morning

n the morning i use vitazing after i wash my face under my eyes
those mornings i forget
i also use it at night.

at night i use kate sommerville's eye cream which is great for overnight
i feel like my eyes look awake even after a night of virtually no sleep since i've been using this
it is great for am or pm usage.
so combine sleep with plantscriptions

i woke up the next morning
i added them to my night time skin care routine
i started using them the day they arrived as well
when i wake up in the morning

this is lovely used in place of a day time moisturizer during the warmer months as well
i wear it at night
i decided to buy it again on sunday
i also use boscia night cream in pm and am.
i used the regular version before this
in 3 days my skin is clearing up
every day to even out my skin tone
however, i am amazed at the overnight results.
after the first night
i am on my third bottle

my skin tone is evening out
this product worked immediately at a reasonable price from the first night i used it the next morning my skin felt more radiant
twice a day, every day--i'm a lifetime fan!

even though i only use this at night
preferring to use them at night
when i use it in the am

at night i spot treat with teatree oil after my face dries from the shower
refreshed after i use this
great for night and morning.
i only use it once in the morning
i do this during shower
only when i am just washing my face
it amazes me how when i use this i wake up in the morning
break out when i leave makeup on overnight
heavy make up event
calms it down from a day to day stress
i didn't notice the warm sensation at first
every night i use this after i get a breakout
i wake up the next morning
i love it in the morning
one in my gym bag for post workout
just used it to wash my face tonight
i used it twice a day in the morning
during midterm exam week
i look forward to washing my face morning
the next day it continued to be soft
similar to the night time cream that i love from algenist
i started using this on my forehead every morning
most of the time i am fine with this on its own
i only apply this at night time
which gets me through the entire day
only it's gone once i wash my face in the morning
lifting cream has become part of my daily routine
night as my regular beauty regime
am starting to get fine lines
i got a 10-day trial of this before
when i use it on the rest of the face
i like that it is light enough to use under my make up in the morning
sensitive than it was in my early 20s
i apply it twice a day
can wear this under my foundation during the day
i will report again after a month's use
i look in my early 50's.
i do rotate in the overnight restor
i only use it at night
have discovered that on nights when i will only get 3-5 hours of sleep i can put this on before i go to bed
like i've had a full night's sleep the next day
'm keeping it around forever to be my magic "of course i slept last night" weapon
massage it all over my face for half minute
refresh in the morning like i have enough sleep
whenever i see my pictures taken during this summer
depuffs my under eye after a long night
it works well for my morning routine
i put this on while still in bed after waking
after 20-30 minutes i hop in the shower
you'll see results in 10-30 minutes.
i can apply this at bedtime
now i keep one in the bathroom
my eyes still water for about an hour after use
lifting during the day
i am using it twice a day
lifting eye gel in the morning
when combined with the algenist overnight restorative cream the results were great
making them burn halfway trough the day
am anxiously waiting to see if i get similar results on my face
found that when i apply it twice a day: after my shower/before bed
when i wake up
after i shower or wash my face in the morning with water
you're not getting shiny just hours into the day
keeps oil at bay for hours
the way it improve your skin after 3 days
i include it in my daily morning routine before makeup
i do sometimes still get a little oily late afternoon in t-zone
after a week i notice my face very smooth
i look forward to putting this on every morning.
i love this in the mornings
for fall through spring it's perfect
my skin is less oily at the midday
usually after 3 hours i'm super oily
after 10 hours i'm still not oily
again in the morning before i put my makeup on
soft all day long
i've started paring it with the korres wild rose cream at night
an hour later my face started looking greasy
i only use it at night.
i used it every morning
night after washing my face
reapply throughout the day
this is my favorite night cream
i also use the one without spf at night as it is heavier
i wear it year round
it is too heavy for day
i love it at night
i put this on at night because it is a little greasy
5 minutes later i can put on my make up
as a day cream on harsh winter days
i miss being able to use this as part of my nightly routine
i used this 5 nights a week in the winter to soothe my dry winter skin
they'd be gone by morning the next day
in the morning after use
i wash my face 2-3 times a days
night with great results
woke up the next morning to beautiful
if you're at the dermatologist every month with little to show for it
i wake up with better skin
after the first night
i woke up after 1 use
feel great in the morning
i wash my face at night
i've used it consistently every night for close to
continue working at night on the computer for 2 hours before i go to sleep
i am in my mid-late 30s
brighten my skin since the first night
bright in the morning
i didn't notice it was just a night cream.
i ended up working on my computer late into the night
i literally saw results the morning after i applied this facial in a jar
glowing in the morning
i mainly used it at night.
i used this as my night cream
i put this on before i go to bed
it is really nice when i pair it with the rose oil at night
it's the perfect night cream for those who can st
this is my favorite night cream.
after a few nights of use my skin is softer than ever
over my advanced night repair before bed
then went on vacation
my face was super soft the morning after applying
i wake up every morning with a bright fresh face
maybe, a little heavy for summer.
after trying out a few night creams in between
smooth the next day
it did wonders with my face overnight
when i wake up
perfect for a night time sleeping facial
after one night of use
nstead iust wear on weekend morning while run earr
because i use this at bedtime
amazing for night time
perfect when i wake up in the morning
typically enough that i am complemented on my skin the day after i use it
note: i accidentally posted this review over on the wild rose moisturizing
when i wake up
i put it to the test one night
after the second night
i saw results first time washing my face.
i'll definitely return to this in the winter time again
let it sit for a minute or two
i am just about 1/3 of the way through it
i usually catch up on tv at night
massage it in for a good 10-15 minutes
i go to this when i have that sudden dry phase
i massage it into my face for at least two minutes
i prefer eve lom more
massage it in for about 30 seconds
can't wait to wash my face at night!
one tub will last a long time
will easily last me a full weekend
clinique take the day off
by the next morning my skin looks amazing
i now use it day and night.
firming for those special nights out
washing my face tonight
i am using this again tonight
at night after cleaning my face
an over night cream
i tried this for a few nights.
i don't just use it morning
check out kate's retasphere night cream
i will be making this a part of my morning beauty routine everyday
i continue to use my moissturizer at night.
i am in my early 40's
once in the morning
the next day morning
at night it repairs itself
my night routine was a huge question mark
in the same lighting once a week
used it only in the morning yesterday
immediately put some on that night
at night i pair it with fresh's black tea night mask for that extra boost
dry again within an hour
i used it every day during the winter
best used at night.
using this at night helped my skin to not dry out
at night after doing a daily peel
dry at the same time
so when i wake up
use a night treatment in the evening
i used this every morning under my makeup
try to use it morning
i am happy to put this cream on every day.
i woke up the next morning to a much brighter
in the morning after i wash my face
in the afternoon after i remove my makeup at the end of the day
i didn't like to use this under makeup as a morning moisturizer because my face would look greasy after an hour
people think i'm in my late 20's
will probably start wearing again in the winter due to its hydration benefits
i swear the first morning after my skin looked better
even in the summertime
this took me a few weeks of nightly use to get comfortable with the smell
that i wish it had spf for daytime
in the morning underneath my foundation
i get a tiny bit of shine by late afternoon
fresh start eye cream in the morning
when you come home at night
i used it once during the morning
no more tightness in the afternoon
to help calm me down before sleep
i hope it gives her a few minutes of peace in the middle of her long days
especially in the humid summers here
am still using the same bottle
my newest use for this though is in my carry on bag when traveling
i love using this before bed!
it stays on my desk at work
helps me to relax so that i can fall asleep
i tried this for the first time last night
i get headaches from looking at the computer all day
f things get hectic at work
also helps with relaxing when trying to go to sleep
i blot less throughout the day
have tried many products to wear under makeup to control the shine i get after a couple of hours in the summer
after going out all afternoon
night at midnight my skin was not showing oil
i am an oil slick just a few hours after applying my foundation
my oil is at bay for almost the full 8 hours i'm at work
i did notice that my skin is less shiny in the afternoon
looking at my face on the fourth morning using this
used it at night as well
on the third night
my skin was still shiny by the afternoon
since adding it to my routine
i put it on at night
during the day i only have to blot ones which is great
like it won't move for hours
i notice a positive difference in my face throughout the day when i apply this product in the morning
i am all set to go
today my skin didn't look shiny even well into the afternoon
am on my third tub of this.
this is now the only product i use morning
when i am in a hurry
in the morning i look fresh
so the small tube will last a while
use it once daily
applied before going to sleep
will use it every night now
i'll just give my skin some rest til then.
my face looked flawless the morning after.
i apply it first thing in the morning to bring down my puffiness
the cooling sensation lasts over a half hour
so bought one for my morning ritual
i love using this in the morning when i am not totally awake
was searching for a product to "wake up" my eyes after long hours of studying
i work nights so i'm tired a lot.
pocket or apply at least once in the morning
i got sick my first week at a new job
my eyes went to normal within the next hour
now i use it every day
under eyes every night
it's great for early mornings when you don't have time for a cold pack
after a long day at work felt fabulous on under my eyes
this morning i work up

i put it on first thing after my morning shower helps with the puffiness
i waked up every morning with huge bags under my eyes

at the end of the work day everyone kept asking me if i was sleepy
on my lunch break
use when i get coffee or tea in the am
i am using every morning
great for mid day pick me up even over makeup.
my dark circles just start to get interesting around 4pm everyday
then apply this afterwards for a quick "wakeup
i wake up looking like a slept 8 hrs.
is the best pick me up/wake up call in morning before applying make up
i tend to use it every morning
4 times a week at night
i do find that i need to reapply it after about 5 to 6 hours for the puffs
it helps wake me up in the mornings.
ling the baggage i get after a night with little sleep--or sometimes my eyes reacting to the weather
perfect at night after long working day
still want to put on in the morning to refresh feeling to my eyes
gives your eyes a wake up call
i put it on in the morning
i wake up in the morning with huge
in one night my skin looked 80% better!
i went back to it for a night
skin felt super good next morning
this is my all time favorite night cream.
every morning i wake up with smoother skin
best night cream that i've ever used.
i will use this cream until i turn 50
it is now part of my winter routine.
t was too much with makeup on top of it for the day
it was perfect as a temporary night cream
took my makeup off that evening
e it to the day cream until next morning
i am on my second bottle at full price
at night i just wear it on it's own after cleansing
any time of day or night
the rejuvenating night cream as part of my nightly skin routine
i see the difference the first time i used it as a night mask
generally on a sunday while i'm in the bath
i will probably start doing overtime at my job
in the morning i can feel
after a few nights of use the changes were awesome
this is a must have night cream.
i came across this night cream on a blog i follow
light at the same time
refreshed after i've used this
perfect for second or morning cleansing

tery soft in the morning
at night after washing my face
i'd put it on at night
it lasts for hours, it's great.
i am on my third jar now.
during the winter season
then at nights after washing my face
the next morning my eyes looked refreshed
given the lack of sleep i ended up getting that night
i take these to conferences or use the night before a big meeting
i leave it on for 20 minutes
the next morning my makeup goes on flawless
woke up this morning with stress
never have time to sleep
throw them in my fridge at nights
apply the next morning when i wake up
i used this after a night of crying
worked well until the 3rd time
put it in the refrigerator over night
put them on the next morning
i used it after a night out
i used one of these on a whim this morning before an event
after a long night out
i woke up at 6am
slept for another 2 hours with it in place
ready to take on another long day
i like to sleep with it on and it stays in place.
i used after a long haul flight
i took a quick nap wearing this
i used them on a long flight
felt wonderful when we woke from our naps
i saved it until i had a very stressful day at work
they're perfect for a 20-30 minute nap or break.
left this on while napping woke up like i'd had an extra night's sleep
usually keep on all night.
ever had a sleepless night
need to look rested in the morning?
by after a late night out
more awake after using this
relaxing saturday morning treatment
my tired looking eyes refresh as though i've slept well all night
this definitely did the trick -- i put it on for 20 minutes
caused me to fall asleep
wake me up afterwards
i woke up this morning
i just combine it with another product for a mini pamper session
don't expect overnight results
feel nice even after the 10 minutes
works great for those mornings where you were out all night or had a crying session the night before
i left it on for 20 minutes
i used this one morning after showering
great to refresh after a late night
i am a flight attendant so the waking up at 3am in various time zones
actually used it before bed
i sleep with it open next to me
lay down in dark cool room for 15 minutes for spa like feeling
before use put the mask 5 minutes in the fridge.
really nice for a nap
being in the air 8+ hours can take a toll on your body
once at the hotel
i wake up every day with bags
i put this eye mask on this morning for like 20 min
after going out all night
i woke up an put this on before my sister's graduation
or to wake you up in the morning
especially following a late night out
since my day to day life is so busy
i put it on before bed
sleep with it on
well rested look in the am
this made my evening 900% better.
because honestly i'd put one on every morning before showering or before a date/day that i have a big meeting
this mask made it look like i had gotten 8 hours of sleep
i looked so refreshed after a hard at work
i gave as a pre-wedding day gift for a bride before going through the hustle of the rest of the day
i put it on my eyes and go to sleep.
huge difference in the morning when i get up.
throw one on after a long night of fun
the first time i tried it i didn't have time to leave it on for the full 10 minutes
for big events or days when i didn't get enough sleep the night before
i did it at night time for 15 minutes
leave it on overnight
after a night of not enough sleep
after i wear it for about 20-30 minutes my husb
i used this during a cat nap before a special event
both times i got complimented the next day that i looked refreshed
went to sleep with it on
he was waiting by the register for me one day
upon the ring of the wake-up call
let it sit for a few minutes then place the mask on my eyes in the morning
left it on for 30 minutes
i will stay stocked up on them for all flights from now on
i put this on at night
my advice is to start once a day then.
that's when i switched to just once a day
it was so bad that i found myself in tears every morning for about a month
on problem areas in am before applying make up
i felt the moisturizer let an oily film on my skin when i woke up the next day
tone my face at night
i applied it every night before my sleep on my blemishes
after one overnight use
i wear it at night before bed
night since early january
only use at bedtime
evening out the skin tone
i apply it twice a day
one pump is all i need in the day and the night.
i apply this alternate day on my face around the nose
once in the morning
now i only use it in the evening
i am at the bottom of my first bottle
i also wash my face only once a day
as soon as i started using this morning
night they started clearing up
it's best to use at night
if i remember to use it every night before bed
i recommend using a good face oil during the day
this is my go to every time i wash my face morning
at night n it works great
i still use and love this every day and night.
night after i wash my face
try it once a day
i didnt like this at first
just in one day i saw awesome results
the first night i used it i saw a substantial change the next morning
i saw this at a local sephora
i am in my late 20's
i've had this bottle since early november
i apply it once a day at night.
my face cleared up in literally 2 days i put it on every night
i am shine free all day
during the winter, my skin also became dry.
however i use this product after every shower
didn't get shiny in a few hours
i go all day without getting a shine
this is my go-to product for daytime.
i only wear this at night since there is no spf!
last time i got the cream
will stick with you throughout the day
up until my early twenties
then i tried this one day
i put it on every night
wake up with beautiful
soft skin the next morning
which is winter here
with on a clear day
almost after the first day my skin was smooth again
i can use it in the morning
i like using this during the day
it is light enough for summer
this line in the day
i used it day and night.
t zone is oily mid-day
i love it for my night time routine
able to keep the oiliness in my face down through even a busy 12 hour shift
this is my daily go to
my mid day shine has stop
lasts the whole day
effective at keeping my skin in check all day
shine free for about 8 hours
i applied it in the morning
my oily t zone stayed matt until afternoon
i am in my late 20s and have combo skin.
i apply it every morning
lasts all day really
not shiny at all the entire day
before the last tube runs out i am ordering a new supply
although the recommendation is to use the cream once daily at night
after a month of use i am hooked
i am into my second month of use
just make sure to use it at night only
i can actually skip foundation in the morning
i looked 10 yrs younger- as if i had slept 16hrs every night for the last month or just got back from vacation
especially when used overnight
is evening out my skin
think this will be a regular winter routine after the summer sun fades
my skin looked better the next morning after my first use
because you use it just at night
saw results the next morning
i am now using it on the back of my h
i actually look forward to washing my face at night
every day i wake up with a brighter
was just about ready to call off the searches
this is now my every night treatment.
i started working sephora at 39 till i was 43 .
always wash your face at night time !!
maybe until the next morning
started using this in the morning
i put it on in the evening
especially in the winter
so the bottle will last you a while
light at the same time
some days i even skip the moisturizer if i'm in a rush out the door
now i am back.
perfect for desert weather as well as winter up north
this product was used on me during a makeover session
is nice for spring through fall
i saw results after the first use.
especially in the winter
i apply this product in the morning
until i find another
decided to use this during the day for hydration
was using it under my previous night time moisturizer
i love to use this serum during the winter time for an extra boost
especially in the winter time
i put in on in the morning before my moisturizer
this is a staple within my morning routine
i keep some in my fridge during the summer
on my body for after sun or a special night
i usually use this after my shower
i've noticed that when i'm at the gym
i love using this in the evening after i use a face mask to revitalize my skin
i put this on every night before i go to bed
after cleaning my face in the morning
great for moisturizing on the go or last minute before going out
thru out the day to give my skin a soft
pat this in every night after my shower
i tried a caudalie dry oil sample before for night time
this is my 4th time purchasing this body oil in the last 1
it doesn't last of the whole day
i put it all over my face at night under my moisturizer
i would recommend only using it before bed
letting it soak in over night
i will wake up
the first time i used this oil i used it as an all over body moisturizer after a long hot day
wanted to try something during the day
just a drop or two before bed
the smell lasts for hours
i tend to use it at night after a bath or shower
the shine goes away within the hour
i usually end up leaving it on for 20 or 30 minutes
especially after i get out of the shower
i left it on for a good 20-30 minutes
the next morning i am still chap-free
i just tried this product for the first time tonight
good for using before bed or before putting on make up in the drier winter months
with fall on the way
i used them last night
let it sit for 10-15 minutes
since i use it at night
the next morning my face felt wonderful
didn't get around to using it until one day i went tanning for a little too long
i used this in the evening
the rest were gone in the morning
i used it again in the morning just incase
tight throughout the day
i sleep with it on my face about twice a week.
i picked this up on a whim during my last visit to sephora
while i think i won't really need to purchase this again during our humid summer months
as soon as i put this on my skin it was instantly soothed for the first time in days
it says to leave it on for 10 minutes
i leave it on for a half hour or so
the next day you see a difference.
in the morning my face would look so good
after three applications, it was right as rain.
i usually leave it on for 25 minutes because
i apply it every second day in the morning while i am doing other chores
especially during the winter
leave on for about 15 minutes
i leave it on overnight
wash it off in the morning
when i woke up the next morning
i apply it once a day
got this as the yearly "birthday present" from sephora
i get no oil throughout the day
it keeps my face oil free for the majority of my 12 hour work day
no grease even after an 8 hour day
i only use it in the morning
i tend to get a mid day shine on my t zone
i feel ready to take the day
the summer months brings extra shine to my face.
to blotting once in the late afternoon
it works well for me in winter and summer.
after this product my foundation last about 7 hrs matte
after application i experience an oil free t-zone for about 5 hours
especially in the summertime
in the summer it is perfect on it's own' in the winter i find i require vinosource s
i get a little shine by the end of the day
it gets worse in the summer
no shine all day long
i used it through the winter
i live in a very humid area
wouldn't start the day without it.
i think this will be my go to for hot summer days
especially in the winter
is especially nice during the cold canadian winter months
great for the coming winter season
i've used this as a day cream when i was visiting a drier climate
i apply twice a day
after my first night using it i woke up to glowing
without anything covering my face in the early morning one day
not only did it save my skin overnight from the winter damage
i used it that night
the next morning when i woke up i had no dry flaky patches i usually experience
i think its a great night moisturizer that would be washed off in the morning
i think if used in the morning
i tried this at night
after washing my face the next day
i am ready to go to bed
if i change out my makeup for evening
tight minutes after leaving the shower
when i woke up
which is why i only use it at night
i will begin to use it before bedtime
so much so that i can use it in the mornings before "applying my face"
i recently used it for a week in seattle's cold weather
leaves it wrinkle free in the morning
there's some brief shine that takes a minute or two to absorb in completely
did not peak through at all throughout my day
for me it works overnight
masks at the same time
it has become a staple in my morning routine
it wreaks havoc on my appearance day-after-day
i wear it every day.
i am on my third tube of this stuff
i spend an enormous time on the computer all day
the applicator helps wake up my eyes first thing in the morning
i usually put it on at night
i am right at the 12 week mark
it makes me feel awake in the morning
it is soothing after a long day
what i like best is the cold touch in the morning
it wakes you up
i work late hours and get very little sleep.
let it set for 10 minutes
under my eyes at night
the cool tip is perfect for early morning puffies
she said to use it every morning
i put it on twice a day
i am not yet at the end of the bottle
he uses it morning
at the beginning of when i started using it
i've only tried it for a week every night
especially in the winter
all you need is a couple drops each night
i saw it in the store for the first time
it was definitely closer to my price range then sunday riley
or just all winter
after having the deluxe sample sitting around for the longest time
i used it every night for a week
am ready for a second bottle
into the next day
sometimes in the day
at first when i apply the product
in the summer when i'm only wearing eye liner/mascara for beach i tend to start using it again in day time
i mix two drops with my night cream at night
then again with my day cream in the morning
after using this oil under my night cream
before my makeup in the am
i also use this at night
the next morning i wake up
i now use it every morning before putting my makeup on
especially in the winter
just a few drops per night
until this winter when my skin once again got so dry i was desperate
happy in the morning
glowing in the morning
i add 2-3 drops to my cerave pm
each morning i would wake up with an incredibly oily forehead
every morning when i wake up now i have normal skin
.......on days i was make up free at that!
i put this on at night all over my face
as in the morning my face is so soft
i apply every night all over my face
i put this on after any masks in the evening
then after night cream.
not snowy at all
i get compliments on how glowing i look almost every day
use it every night
at night when i've taken my makeup off

perfect for the dry, cold months ahead.
i put this in a night
in the morning it's glowing
use it at night
'm not shiny by midday
the first day i used it
this is the perfect night time oil.
it was last night
when i woke up this morning i noticed the dry areas pretty reduced
it's not fixed overnight
ready for the day
in which case i'll apply it in the morning under makeup as well
i put it on after my facial cream at night
i put it on every evening
you can even use this during the day under foundation or at night
i'll apply a few drops of this to my face in the morning on days when my skin is feeling a little more dry or on days that i'm not wearing makeup
use it after every shower
slap on some sunday riley luna night oil with it before bed
i only use this at night before sleeping
wouldn't use it during the day
this one doesn't leave my skin shinny in the morning
expect a miracle over night
i will continue to use this on my 42 year old sun damaged skin until the end of time
my skin feels brighter the next day after i have applied at night
next morning a lot brighter
tried this once every other night
i cleanse am/pm
i am on my fourth week of using the product twice daily
after one week i noticed a sun spot starting to fade
i only use this at night
since i use an aha treatment in the morning
i only used it for 3 nights

on nights when i want to give my skin a break
day or night or both
i apply this before bed
after my second night using it my skin cleared
this is my new night treatment.
this bottle will last you about 30 days if you use morning
night without the pads
i only use at night after my face wash
this is great for evening out skin tone
this isn't an overnight miracle so you have to stick with it every night

i am now a week in
will wait to post until i am done with the bottle
i've now added it to my daily skin routine.
i am on my second bottle of this stuff
i usually use it once a day
in the night before i sleep
i am on the last few drops
i am 35 this is the first product i have tried on sun damage
i typically apply makeup in the morning right after an application
considering i use just a few drops in the morning
i started using it every night starting in december of last year
it's a wonderful feeling to wake up in the morning
while i was on it
by the next morning
i dab this on them at night

i've used it both overnight
put it under your eyes in the morning
i mostly use it as a spot treatment overnight
i when i wake up
i usually apply it before i go to bed so even after i wash it off
i don't recommend using it in the morning due to the
wash it off in the morning
during the day i blend it until is clear.
if i use it overnight
after the first use i saw results

it also helps to reduce//control the overall oil on my face during the day which is great on days i wear foundation
left it on overnight
the next day i put it under my make up
put it on again overnight
i usually do a 10 minute mask every night then spot treat to sleep
after to using it as an over night treatment
i can sleep in it.
i also use it as a spot treatment under my makeup in the morning
wearing it every single night as a mask

by morning my skin was 95% back to normal
i used it only at night.
i just leave it on over night for best effects

i will continue finish the trial set
i actually mainly use it at night.

it became a mini luxe ritual in my daily routine
the next day i couldn't stop checking my skin in the mirror
pm for 3 straight weeks
for normal skin it is perfect for the fall/winter
at night before bed
the tone appears to be evening out
after one week of using this cream morning
using this in the morning helps my skin stay nice
that means i wash my face several times a day.

it's hard for me to justify spending nearly $200 on night cream
i apply it after washing my face at night
i apply it before i go to sleep
the next morning i wake up to a nice soft looking skin
softer after a nights sleep
although the smell does fade after about an hour or so
i wake up the next morning

after i take off my makeup at night
i put my estée lauder intensive night repair serum on then put a full pump of this over it
then in the evening i add a couple of drops of the drunk elephant marula oil
all you have the next morning is plump
night after my showers
ive been using it for 3 days in the am after my shower
in the pm after washing my face
is perfect for day/night
with this i am good all day
i only use it in the morning
i found later on in the day my dry patches would come back
works beautiful underneath make-up or for night time
when i used this i woke up the next day to dramatically clearer looking skin
i usually apply nightly
and my makeup stays set for hours.
i put this on at night
as part of my am routine
however this moisturizer was a shocker to me i put it on one night the next morning my skin felt amazing
thought i would try it during my morning routine
reaplied during the day i can feel the sun more then before
could wear it in the daytime
i mix it together with an spf during day.
i wear it any season
i also put this on before bedtime
light for during the day or evening
i only use this in the morning
shesiedo night recharge at night
only use it at night because of the shine
ok so a while back i posted a less than wonderful review on this cream
i saw improvement in my skin when i woke up the next morning
for a week day and night i used twice a day!
i only use it at night as i prefer an spf during the day
i do use it only at night
because i have noticed that if i put it in the morning
i wanted a cream since winter is here
after easing my face at night
i put it on the same way as soon as i get out of the shower
it lasts all day
sometimes forgetting at night
once in the morning on my nose
what i've figured out is that if i use this every morning before putting on my makeup
so that when i clean my skin in the evening it is so much cleaner to begin with
night after the intensive pore minimiser
this summer the weather here has been extremely humid
use it at night
i sleep with the origins drink up intensive overnight mask on
left it on for 12 minutes
i leave it on for over an hour
use a mask every night
used this the day before prom
i used it before bed
when i woke up
drinking my way through a week away
i got a sample to try it left t on my face for about 12-15 minutes till it got dry
i wash my face morning
24 hrs later still feeling the effects of this mask
i like to leave it on for 15 minutes
because i usually use this at night
by the next morning my skin looks 10x better than normal
i leave on for 2
i left it on for 12 minutes
dewy for days after
so when i saw the 3 pack go on sale before christmas
today was the first i used it.
when you rinse it off after the 20 minutes
after wearing this mask for only 10 minutes
it is more dry during the winter
brighter the morning after i use this
every time i use this
leave it on for 20 to 30 minutes
the first time i did it
i got this on my sephora play box this month.
not just for the night
i feel comfortable during my work week without foundation at this point
it in the evening
usually have to wait a few hrs to head out in oublic
i used am and pm and sometimes 3x a day.
especially during the winter
after all i did tried to sleep earlier
how can i lose my terrible dark circles by just sleeping a lil early for 3 days?
in air conditioning all the time
after one application i look like i've gotten the most well-rested sleep of my life
use the lancôme only at night
am not even half way through the jar so this will last a while
which was at night
now that i am approaching 50
perfect for the summer
that would only be for my morning application
i just stop thinking about my day for the few minutes while i use it
i put it on every morning
at night before bed
i am in my mid 30's
i noticed the first few times i used it at night my skin was very oily the next morning
i am in my late 30's
i leave the house most days without foundation or powder on
cannot use it during the day
it is excellent during the day
some nights i used my regular night cream.
it seemed that shortly after starting to use it
so, i stopped using it every day.
i would recommend only using it at night
with my nightly routine
after a long day at work my makeup is not wet nor do i look like i've been working out when i'be been sitting at a desk all day
once in the morning
again in the evening
i place it on my face
not during the day
after a week of use my skin was much firmer
my skin tone is evening out
it's light enough for twice daily use.
i apply this every morning and night.
even now in my late 20's
light at the same time
it actually makes the face cleaning session a pleasant one
i double cleanse at night
do a light wash in the morning
this bottle is going on strong to month 2 or 3
they work for me in the summer.
fresh after each wash
softer time after time
i am currently on my second bottle.
before jumping in the shower
dirt at the end of the day
i love that i can use one product in the evening to remove my make-up
i tried this on before bed after a full day of work
now im on the second week
i am currently on my second bottle.
smooth in the morning
i definitely will continue to use it at night.
the first night i put way too much on
use this in the morning
then i'd recommend putting it on at night before bed then can wash off the leftover moisture in the morning
when i used it in the mornings i'd have to plan ahead to get other things done while the cream was sinks by in
i feel like i am having a spa experience every evening after applying the cream
this is a nice face cream for night use
in the morning my skin is nice
skin feels just as silky smooth in the evening as it does in the morning after application
i apply it both in the morning
prior to my make-up
again at night before bed
which at first i thought ‘meh’
by the morning my skin feels oh so new again
then decided to just use the product once a day in the mornings
in the morning when i wash my face
again in the morning after i wash my face
using this cream in the morning
my skin is on the dry side in the summer due to being in the sun
i find it comfortable for use both in the morning
you should stay out of sunlight for at least an hour after applying
i apply it on clean skin twice a day.
it has been a great addition to my nightly routine
after just a week of using nightly
i look forward to slathering it on each night
even when used daily
which means extra time in the morning
i couldn't stop caressing my face during work in the first few weeks
i definitely notice when i haven't used it in the morning
because of this, i only used it at night.
pm i use the essence
just add this at night
stays 'happy' all night long
every time i try to use different night cream i get disappointed
one of the best night cream i have tried
started using it as my last skincare step before bed every night
right before lancome renergie lift multi-action night cream
i like to alternate nights between the renergie night
i used this the first night
i don't put this on at night because it travels over night
this is divine in the morning
i exercise 5 days a week
every morning before my make up
when i put it on last night
i apply the cream in the morning and at night.
even the night before it makes for reduced puffiness in the morning
especially after a not so great night of sleep
just continued to use what i had on h
spring from the tube
lasts through the day
don't get much sleep during the day
this makes me look like i slept eight hours
the morning after i used this mask
i made sure i tested the product at home at the end of the day
when i wake up in the morning
love this mask in the summer time.
sometimes i spot treat during the week
we'll use this as a full mask 1-2 times weekly
after 5 minutes it stops
i do a full mask weekly
after shower i use this mask for 20 minutes
i kept it on about 15 minutes
my key is to apply it at night
wash it off before bed
i did this ever night for three nights
when first opening it
i washed it off after 15 minutes
i washed my face in the morning
literally half an hour later it's so greasy
use immediately upon returning from a trip to detox
20 minutes with this mask
tightening at the same time
i put it at night for 30 minutes
the next morning the same small pores.
only leave it on for about 10 minutes max
it does leave your face pretty red for about half hour after you use it
keep it on for at least 20 minutes
that was until i found glamglow.
thanks to using this in the morning
it wasn't until i read up more on it that i resounded it can also
one of the ladies at sephora recommended this treatmemt for my oily skin as a daily am
my face gets oily just within an hour
perfect for winter time.
t's something i have to put on before bed
good for any time of the day or night
put it on in the morning
worked in the garden for 4 hours
i tried again the next day with the rest of the sample
i feel it comfortably absobs within 2-3 minutes enough to continue with regular makeup routine
is the only part that usually gets greasy during the day
my face is so soft in the morning
use origins with spf during warm summer days
nightamins during warm summer nights then in the winter i switch to this one since it's more hydrating
stays on for the whole day4.
during a bout of really dry
its perfect all day anytime of the year
with the winter coming need this morning
i just happened to run into this while i was at the store browsing around
after washing my face at night
by mid-day it was oily
i try to make sure i put it on within three minutes of being out of the shower
this cream actually gave me some relief at night
for my personal skin type about the 5 hour mark i'm having to use blotting papers
by the time midday came around
i can easily go about 5 hrs
that 5hrs is amazing
it does dissipate in under an hour
fresh i look forward to applying it every day
after a hot day of being outside with friends i put a bit of this stuff on couples with the wake up call product
s my 12 hour shifts at work
nights out with friends
by midday my skin starts to get really oily so this is perfect for fighting the midday shine
my skin stays matte almost the entire day when i put this on in the morning
i find best results if i wait a couple minutes after applying this before i put on makeup
i also use it at night right before bed
it is also great during mid-day touch ups!
now a staple to my nightly skin routine.
i only use it at night before bed to allow for maximum benefit
i found that my face remained slightly oily all day when i use it in the day time
at night it had time to absorb
when i wake up in the morning
is relaxing before i go to bed
i tried just the maracuja one night
i put on a full face of makeup the other day for the first time since i began using the oil
i am almost done the bottle which is a first for me
i put it on every night before i go to bed
was surprised after about 6 hours of wear
another great product to my nightly routine.
sometimes just on my dry patches at night
i put a few drops on every night
i usually put some all over my face either right in the morning or before i out on make up
am in all weather all the time
wake up every day with my skin soft
two drops at night after washing my face
it is a life saver at the end of the night.
i wake up in the morning with super soft

if i decide to use it during the day
throughout the day i am blotting less
i put it on an hour before work
love my skin the next morning.

i would recommend this at night time before bed!
i noticed results around the 2nd day.

and tried it the past couple mornings/nights.
especially in the morning

exams all the time
i apply it on the mornings
i couldn't believe when i began to see my skin transform after the first night of using it

my single complaint is that some nights if my eyes have been watering
its too heavy for daytime
i like it at night

this is my morning favorite
also before bed after i wash my face
twice a day to get the best results

in the morning i wash
even after wearing foundation all day

i'll try applying it over-top of my night-time skin care
if used at night
started using it that night until the end of the work week
every night i used it the next morning my skin looked plump
like it did in my early 20's before the binge drinking

this overnight mask is a must!
used it that same night

after one night if using it i will be buying another tube when i run out
is thick enough to stay on through the night
i noticed that the next morning my face was less red
does not wear off at all even during the long night of sleep
my face looks about the same in the morning
at the same time i can't put heavy/a lot of moisturizer on in the morning or my foundation will just slide off within hours of applying
love how this makes my skin feel when i wake up in the morning
i don't recommend using this during he day time
i notice that when i apply this overnight
brighter looking the next morning
i see an incredible difference the next morning on the nights that i do use this
feeling oily every morning i wake up
i only used at night time
smooth the next day
so when my nighttime skincare routine came i did my usual stuff
then used another night cream i had

i also love the scent; very calming before bed.
after a night application my skin looks fresh
gross in the morning
put it on right before you go to sleep
my skin feels like my 10-year old's in the morning

love this for every day use.
dry on the outside
i switch between this in the winter
i do let the cream stay on my face for at least 10 minutes before putting on my make up because if not it won't stay on
this will be fantastic for the chicago area spring/summer/fall
i wear at night
i've added this to my night time routine.
this one is my favorite for the winter.

depending on the season
usually at night after i wash off my make- up
will be on my 3rd bottle soon
especially in the spring
i put this on first thing in the morning
i only use it in the mornings
this is a great over night mask
i put it on a few hours before bedtime
at the same time
the first few times i woke up with more radiant skin
i started to use this as a nighttime moisturizer because my skin started to look dull towards the end of the winter months
apply the mask all over then go to sleep
wonderful in the morning
i usually leave it on for about 15 minutes or longer
great for before a special night out
it's mostly great at night after a hectic day after washing your face
i usually use it in the morning
a little bit dabbed on the face mid afternoon is the perfect refresher
tsubaki beauty oil had become a must in my morning
i put this on at night
with literally just a drop of this oil in my morning
now that i'm in my mid-20s
this is perfect for the morning time.
however i use this product in the morning as well as evening
i found my skin is much better in night than during the day
we have the coldest weather
i cover my face with this oil every night after cleansing
in the morning my face is so smooth
as soon as the fall/winter weather hits
lighten up on use in the humid summer months
whenever i wear it my skin is glows after a few hours
i apply 2 drops mixed with my foundation in the morning
when i wake up in the morning
i am afraid to use oils during the day
rub it in in the morning
i put two drops on before bed
three in the morning before makeup
in the morning i do not use a moisturiser i just tone

i saw a youtuber put this under her foundation so that is what i do in the morning
i also use it at night
i mix it with my daytime
in the mornings i just use 3 drops
i only use this product at night after i was my face
even in the morning
it was mixed with my old moisturizer at night before bed
i've used it every night
by the next day i'm glowing again

reapply powder after my 20 minute drive to work every morning
i received this as part of the holiday set that came with my foreo luna for normal/sensitive skin
i put it on day & night.
i mix it in with my night cream
i add 5 drops of this to my day
i dab it on at night before bed when the weather is warm
at night i apply a few drops
i also happened to have a cold when i first purchased this
for the first time in a while i feel like i can leave my house without makeup on
at least not a night time one.
i wake up every morning with perfect skin
even using it morning
i now use it morning and night.
i ususally just leave it on for about 30 minutes then shampoo it out
every morning i wake up with bright
apply over my night cream
in the morning my skin looks
every time i would be getting ready for a night out at her house
i may stop or reduce the amount i use during the summer months when it's humid
now i just use it at night
every other day at night
morning before putting on make up
i apply a few drops at night
in the morning about 10 minutes before i put on my makeup primer
you only use 2-3 drops at night
is perfect for the dc spring/summer/early fall weather
glow to wake up my skin in the morning
i applied this before going to bed
the next day my skin was glowing
i applied every night for a week
i leave it in the shower hoping my husb
being in my late 30's
i started using it at night only
i apply this product every night before bed
in the middle of winter
i put it on last night
i wear this in the winter as well
had just tried it on this morning
i will decide when i take off my makeup tonight
see if my skin is baby soft from having the product on during the day
i put this on after i shower
i used this.during exam period.
very amazing after the night i applied it.
the next day i woke up
no one would believe i slept at 3 am yesterday!
i actually look forward to applying it to my face every morning
is recommend it for use on non-make up days or under a moisturizer in the evening
especially in the summer because its light
the last one before i go to bed
i put it on like a night cream
when i looked in the mirror the following morning
by the 3rd day my dry patches were gone
put it on every morning
let it soak in a few minutes
not oily after whole night sleep
gets oily later in the day
love this as a night cream.
it's in the 'get worse before it gets better' phase
i only use it for the night
this is the perfect cream for the spring-summer season
while i get a bit oily in the morning
the only thing i've noticed is that by the end of the workday
it is perfect as a night cream though.
so i wear it at night and love it for that!
i do the same exact routine for the daytime!
especially in the winter
use this before my night cream from origins.
clean after i use this
upon waking up in the morning
as if i am putting roses on my face.
i also use the eye cream every night
t's important for me to get all makeup off at the end of the day
i only use the product at night after a long day
i applied before go to bed every day when i woke up i can see my skin look brighter
after the first night of using it
i love this oil and use it nightly.
s with it before bed
although it was a bit heavy during the humid summer
i i've been using this morning
i only wear this at night
i can't live without this oil in my nightly routine
put it on at least 30 minutes before applying my makeup
i love this oil for the am before i put my makeup on
told myself i would use it only at night
i started noticing that i was waking up in the mornings like i had make-up on
night time is not enough!
i only use it at night for this reason
i only use it at night
when i wake up
s on your face for a few seconds each time
i am on the dry side
i can wash the color off in the morning.
whenever i put this oil on my face after my night time routine
as for making your skin orange during the day
the first time i used this product was during my morning routine it left my face with a bright orange glow
i suggest putting it on 30 minutes before bed
the morning after using this for the first time
i put it on before bed one night
when i woke up in the morning i was shocked by how smooth my skin felt
wait a few minutes before you put your face on your pillow
now i just use a little bit of this every night
powder during the day
in just a week the results in my skin are fabulous
great in the morning or evening under moisturizer
i love this oil for nighttime use.
on the nights i skip it
by the time the morning rolls around
i apply this once before bed
once in the morning along with my toner
i am in my late 20's
i woke up the next day
leaving me with gorgeous skin in the morning
it's worth having to smell a bit odd for an hour or so at night
continue with the rest of my routine
going to school full time
probably due to the fact i never get more than 6 hours sleep
can't wait to wake up every morning without my fine lines
i only use this at night
or at most put a small drop in my moisturizer during the day time
use it morning and night.
this is what happens when you shop on your lunch hour
ter every morning under my make up
never use it in the morning before i apply my makeup
i only use it as part of my night time routine
use it in my nighttime routine
especially in fall/winter
use it for the night only.
prefer to use it only at night
i am on my third bottle of this.
definitely a night-time only cream
the next morning my eye area was smooth
after applying a third night
my conclusion after using it for an entire month is that it works great to keep my skin moisturized at night
when i wake up in the mornings
i only wear it at night.
have also began using it in the morning prior to applying my makeup
i apply this balm all over my face during the winter season
i don't notice any color difference after using it for 3 mornings
starting in april i started using this again
it makes it look like i spent an afternoon outside
i put it on in the morning after washing my face
i apply it to my whole face before bed
easy to use for day and night.
the next day my makeup went on so smoothly
i usually try it in the summer at night time
my coworkers all said how rested i looked the very first day i used this
around the same time
as i did once before
i am nearly out
however after the first use i noticed that my skin wasn't as oily during the day
sometimes at night too
for a pick me up during the day
it's got a nice orange scent that i felt went good for early morning to help wake you up
i will definitely be using this in my every day routine
it's a fantastic addition to my morning routine
i've used this 2 weeks straight every am/pm
prefer to use it in the morning
i loved using this on my dark tired eyes each morning
need a nice boost in the morning :
i just apply it on my face morning
makes it perfect for mornings
perfect to wake up your skin in the morning
light for the summertime
it lasts all day
is a great start to my morning routine
i used it morning
i prefer using this during night time once i've cleansed my face
i struggle with oily areas during the summer
it really perks me up in the morning when i use it
i used this product both in the morning
love using this every day.
a definite must have for your morning routine!
i only use it at night because dr
at night after i shower
in a few hours my face would feel dry again
looks so good throughout the day after my one use in the morning
i usually put it on at night
at night before going to bed
wake up with a smooth feeling base to start my day
which i love, especially in the morning.
ready for the day :
even tried it this morning
i i apply on my face every morning when i bathe
i love adding this to my morning routines!
the moisturizer didnt leave me looking pily after a few hours of sitting under my makeup
it's my morning go to product.
i used it every morning
ready to begin the day
especially in the morning
even when i think my skin is shining after 6 hours
stay on all day
keeps my makeup on all day and i work 12+ hours.
went to the ladies room in the afternoon
if i am wearing make up
wear extending properties make it perfect for weekend/special occasion use
my last stop at sephora
it stayed matte for hours without overdrying
lasts all day and into evening.
southern summer is the worst
meaning long-hour drive
i can wear it alone or with a cc cream on hot summer days
firmer all day until i take it off at night
everything looks the same in the evening as it did when i applied it in the morning
i decided to try it out this morning
i am in my very early 30's
the thing that made me fall in love was the day i wasn't going to leave the house
i paid no attention to it until after supper when i wiped my h
was using it as a night cream
my skin was noticeably different when i woke up in the morning
after about 6 weeks i started to use it just in the mornings
i work nights so my skin can look run down due to lack of sleep
i only use this in the mornings
i only use it in the morning
i apply it once at night a few times a week when my skin super clean from the clarisonic
i am all for spending when it comes to skin care
i only wear this in the daytime
will do another round in september for my dark spots
i know only use it in morning
the algenist overnight cream as well
have found i need the overnight cream morning
i tried that last night
this is definitely a serum you put on at night before bed
from the first night i used it
i put it on at night only.
although the directions say to use in the morning
only use this at night
am now on my third bottle
it's my daily routine
my face is baby soft after using this for a week
it's great at night under my night cream
great for day under my make up
i used this every night before bed
i am now on my third jar
am now on my second order
it goes on smoothly at night
in the morning my skin looked much more even
i apply this after cleansing my face both am
i put it on before bed
i felt results first thing in the morning
i will never use another night cream!
i wake up with better skin everyday.
when i put this on at night
wake up in the morning my face feels baby soft
i can use this every night
returned that night cream
i wake up with glowing skin every time
i can feel it working when i put it on at night.
when i wake up in the morning
i am only on day 2
after using this at night
i woke up in the morning
this will definitely stay my night cream for a while
i got the 3 pack value set they had during the holidays
when i wake up in the morning it looks amazing
in the morning if i'm not wearing makeup that day
i've used it both at night
i put this on in the morning after cleansing
i used it last night
when you wake up it feels like you slept on a cloud
use right before bed
in the morning i notice an even tone
i wear it at night
the next morning my skin is glowing
tthis is the best night cream of life
ready to face a new day
when i use this night cream on a regular basis
i will put this on for the day
started using it nightly
i wake up with glowing skin and use am as well.
in the winter i use it day
oily at the same time
oily at the same time?
i get compliments on my skin on almost daily basis
just a couple nights of using this mask
while i do notice my face feeling softer each morning
it's so nice to just put it on before bed
especially in the winter
i feel this product lasts well overnight
when i used this product before it was not an overnight facial
it was just your normal leave on for a while
it is now overnight
for those mornings you need your face to look flawless put this on the night before
this is my go to night time facial.
i needed a new overnight moisturizer so took advantage of the 20% sale
i wake up looking refreshed
i will look at my skin in the morning n it was bright
i never really knew what "evening" or "brightening" meant until i tried this
i used it as a mask instead of leaving it overnight
tried it last night
i don't use this every night
i applied the whole packet to my face before i went to sleep that night
i actually use it 4 days a week as a daily morning moisturizer
i love this product and use it night and day.
no oil on my face in the morning
i usually wake up every morning with a really oily face
i wake up with softer skin every day that i use it
i apply before bed
am going to purchase the other sleeping facial
always in the sun daily
this was last sunday 06/11/17
i used the oil morning
by wednesday it was completely flat
gives your skin a nice glow the next morning when you wake up
but only using 4 drops at night, it lasts awhile.
i wore it that night
the next morning my skin was significantly less red
while my skin was a bit on the oily side in the first couple of days
i recommend this at night, not for the day.
this is great for an addition to a regular skin routine as an added bonus in place of moisturizer before bed
the first night i used it i just used the oil
so the next night i used it
i just apply the oil at least 15 minutes before i apply my makeup
i really enjoy using it in the mornings
usually every other day
i absolutely love putting this oil treatment on each night
regular use every night
went back to powdering my face every three hours or so
i wash my face twice a day now
when i wake in the morning
i made another change to my daily routine
after the first use at night
i only use it at night
i like to use it on my face after a shower
this is for night time use
my skin is so soft in the morning when i wake up that i really don't care what i look like at night
it feel so luxurious to put on every evening
in the morning i wake up with plump
waking up looking like you spend at least 700 $ at facial spa last night is amazing
by noon my t zone is oily
night after cleansing with my clarisonic
i am less oily in my t zone during the day
however everyone should wash their face morning
only need 2 drops for the face at night.
mind you i am already in my mid-30s!
the next morning my h
started using it twice a week at night from that point onward
definitely too heavy for me for daytime
this during the day
it is the perfect pair for my summer routine.
stays non-greasy throughout the day
at least i put it on my face
dont wear it during daytime
i usually wear it during night time
the next day i wake up n it looks amazingly good!
dewy by the afternoon
neck every day since the age of 16
i don't end up 'shiny' later in the day.
i found this before for $10 at check out in store
apply this in the mornings after having first applying both toner
be good for the day
my skin felt dry after a couple of hours
am on my second small jar
even if i don't wash my face at night
i will apply this first before heading to the beach
i put it on like 2-4 times a day
this is great for during the day
i used this cream during the day due to it's 30spf
i walk 5-6 miles outside every day
in the winter anyway
i am on my second bottle
the next morning it was softer
i will be keeping this in my daily routine
i first used it at night
was amazed at how soft my skin was the next morning
one drop at night another at day hours later that day looked in the mirror amazing it was drops of fresh air for my face i'm prone to get acne i also use proactive extra strength skin care pack cause i get cystic acne as well i'm 34 going to be 35 soon my skin a year ago decided to go crazy on me one day just woke up to dull skin
it works well at night or under makeup during the day
the instructions state to use under skin routine in the morning
loved it: pulled the trigger in november during the vib sale
s of time on my skin
in any case i reduced the applications from twice a day to only in the evening
i would suggest morning
i used this in the morning before makeup
as a part of my nighttime skin care routine
i just put it on at night
after just that one night was pretty amazed at the results
definitely in my late 20's
i am in my early 20s now.
came across this the other day
put it on at night under a nice face cream
man if i had a month of putting this on
i put it on before bed
kind of just made it part of my daily/nightly regime
it took me one day to see results
be sure to wash face thoroughly the morning
i used josie maran's argan oil before bed every night
i used their vissionaire before
i saw a difference with my skin the first morning after i applied it the night before
using it in the morning
i am on my third bottle of this product.
however during this heat wave we are experiencing in wa
i do use a separate set of eye products at night.
i am normal to dry
use as an overnight treatment and thank me later.
also during the day when i need some extra hydration
will keep as a year round staple!
it's great for applying it right before bed
i see the difference the next morning
i kept it on for 30 minutes
just 15-30 minutes i believe
i love it more as an overnight spot treatment
ncredible that i am taking the time to write my first review ever
when time was up
when i woke up in the morning about 1/4 of the acne on my forehead was gone
then 1-2x a week from then on
literally saved the tiniest bit to put on the night before an event i have this week
i usually leave it on for an hour vs 20 mins.
by the next morning
after a stressful week or a long flight
leave for about 15-30 minutes
i usually use it at night for about 30min.
have also used it in the morning or before an event for 10-15min to feel extra radiant
seriously two nights using this as a spot treatment
woke up the next day to soft
noticed the next morning with makeup on that my face looked glowing
used it one night after washing my face
wash it in the morning
tried this out before bed
i used what was left of the mask as a spot treatment overnight
i put it on for about 20 minutes.
when i was at sephora
next morning, bumps were much better.
used it last night
didn't notice much the night i put it on
i did like this mask- a noticed a glow the next day
usually sleep with this mask on once a week
after using i can go makeup free the next day
i just used this product for the first time tonight
left on for 20 minutes
literally the next morning my skin was glowing
when i use this 3 times a week it really helps to keep my breakouts at bay
i live in a cold
i still use it every night
the smell alone will wake you up in the mornings
once a week is good with my routine
i just got today.
i only use it at night
also the instructions say to use morning
when i take off my makeup at the end of the night
wakes me up in the morning.
then just wash it off in the shower
i only use this product in the morning
refreshed after using this
the directions say to use this at night as well
i double cleanse at night with this as the second step in order to get all the makeup off
i usually use it on the weekends- it definitely makes my skin 'glow'
at the same time it is gentle
or to get ready for the night
i would not use this as my first cleanse in the evening
i usually leave it on 10 to 15 minutes for a quick mask
which i still am
it makes my skin look like i slept for hours longer than i did
will keep it as a staple in my routine
i only use it at night
then i follow up with the rebuilding moisturizer in the day time
use it as my cream during the day
this product is like a wake-up call
i usually wake up in the morning with oily skin even tho i'd just washed my face the night before
then i reach for my breakfast
that 2pm pick-me-up for long photo shoot days
even during the day
i don't get a full night of sleep
i go to sleep late sometimes
mostly at s reasonable hour
i love using it in the morning.
roll it under my eyes every morning
i've gone to sleep with tired
when i wake up in the morning
best applied before bedtime
apply at night before bed
definitely helps on hot nights
fresh when i remove my make up at the end of the day
the morning after i applied this for the first time
i used it mostly at night
left my skin lighter in the morning
also keeps me shine free during the day
spending so much time in the sun
i've found it better to use at night for me
so during the day i use murad's oil control mattifier
keeps shine at bay for at least 8-10 hours!
i only use this in the mornings now
i work in the sun
then mix the rest with acure day cream
i put one drop in my night serum
fine lines are gone in the morning!
after 1 day, i woke up to radiant skin.
look in the mirror in the morning
use this product in the morning.
use about 3 drops in morning
can be used morning
while i used it regularly for a while
on days after using this oil the night before
i can use it once every 2-3 nights
had only 4 hours of sleep
in the summer time i notice it really brightens my face
started only with 2 drops only at night
could see a difference after using the oil with my regular moisturizer the first night
as i was spending more time in the sun
i started using the oil in the morning as well
this product was amazing during this past chicago winter
i look forward to applying this oil after i wash my face before bed
i apply before bed
the same day my husb
i noticed my skin was dry again at bedtime
i wake up in the morning with soft bright skin
i tried it first at night
tried it the next day as my moisterizer
using on a nightly basis
with dry co weather i also use this every other night
twice from the same person at work
my skin looks great on the following morning
my makeup goes on nicely the next morning too.
the first night i used it i woke up with radiant skin
i put it on at night and under my foundation.
i put it on at night after washing my face
oils i cycle through at night
i put this on at night before bed
i am on my second bottle.
it can be used in the daytime
feel so smooth each morning
when i wake up
can last for a day or night
this oil for night time
i mostly use this at nighttime
im on the oily side during the early afternoon
i found that the days where i am lazy
i am in my mid 50's
while in denver i also used this in the day
now back at sea level i only use it at night
i've used 4-5 drops every morning
after the first night
i don't have to worry about waking up one morning just to find i've run out of product
three days of using the oil at bedtime
my skin isn't drenched in oil when i wake up in the morning
in the morning on my forehead
the bosnia is heavier and i like that at night
t's easy to use in the morning
that same day i was at sephora
bought this to use at night in lieu of the eye
thought that by using the oil at night
night with my day
i am in my late 20s with oily skin
evening out skin tone
plump in the morning after i use it at night
as an estee lauder specialist told me that it can be used in the morning as well as evening
i pair it with the eye cream in the evening!
this is all in only one week of nightly use.
since i'm in my late 40's
the first night i tried it the next morning my skin was radiant
after some time of using this every night
results after first night !!
i used it like 3 nights in a row until i first saw the results
at night along with moisturiser
the next day morning my skin looks like i had enough sleep
if i skip a day
2-3 drops per night is more than enough.
really helps it glow the following morning
feels so better in the morning when i use this
after even just one night
you have to apply it at least 40 mins before sleep as it will come off on pillow
i look rested and will continue to use it daily.
it has been evening out my skin tone
the morning after i used this for the first time i woke up glowing
looking refreshed even though i only got 4 hours of sleep
knowing i will see results in the morning
use it under my eyes during the day as well
after an hour my skin is glowing
i usually use it at night
in the mornings when my skin is on the drier side
like in the winter
it's a must in everybody's night time routine.
love it, makes my night time regimen complete.
this didn't happened over night
honestly when i wake up in the morning my skin looks totally refreshed
one night of use i was hooked
this product will change your night time routine!
i saw the difference the following day
the majority of my girlfriends have also added this to their evening routine
the next morning it had dried out all of my breakouts
my skin is so happy in the morning
it is even evening out my skin tone
i woke up next morning and wow!
i wear it during the day too
i used it last night
i went to get my daily starbucks before heading into the office
each night i use it i wake up to brighter
in my late 40s
i am in my early 20s
night after washing my face
not oily at all during the day time
i love using it during day time under my make up.
spent a lot of time at the beach in the sun
today was my first day wearing this under my moisturizer
the advanced night serum for the night
at night before bed just cause i love it lol:
i am also on my second bottle of advanced night repair
im set for the day
i still have to blot oil about 1-2 times in a 12 hr work day
use it every day
also a great start for long weekends with outside activity
or alone before going outside
i am getting close to 40
i put this before i drive to the office moisturizer
after applying it in the morning my face looks like a grease ball in the afternoon
i started to use this cream day
added it to my nightly routine before going to bed
next morning after i used it my skin felt so much softer
great stuff i will also use it in the pm before i go to bed with my other skin care
i stumbled upon this one day while at sephora.
feels like i've had a day at the spa.
need it every day.
just to leave this review
every once in a while i stop using it
only once a day at bedtime before i put on my shiseido benefiance eye creme
i am in my early 30's
i woke up one morning
i started using this at night
pm despite it saying night repair
the first night i used it i woke up
used every night with an eye cream
this product is wonderful after only a week of using in the morning
i live in northern quebec where winter temperature can get to -40 during winter
using just a tiny amount at night makes me look less tired in the morning
i woke up in the morning
refreshed right after application
do not sleep as much as i would like during the week
at night over estée lauder advanced night repair
dry by the end of the day
since i'm in my early 20s
your eye will return to normal
omg the first time i used this as a night time facial wash i saw a huge difference when i woke up
i used it as a mask the first night
a cold cream at night to take off my make up
i like that you can use it a couple times a week as a mask or every day as just a wash
i leave it on for about 5-10 minutes
i love to use this in the morning when i wake up
i like to use 2-3 drops at night after i wash my face
at night with my night serum
every morning i wake up
it's like a mini pampering session for my skin every day
i apply it every night
during the day before i put on my foundation
thought it was too heavy for daytime
used it at night instead
the original one at night
i put it on at night
i like using this as the last step of my skin routine at night
a little goes a long way during the day or a good amount at bed time
it lasts me a while
the regular at night
i like to use it in the morning before i apply my face cream
by the second day using just a few drops morning
this one in the morning before makeup
only use it a night time
i apply after i wash my face at night
after i put it on my face at night
as i apply it day
when i apply it during the day
i add a few drops to my spf every morning
this one i use daily under make up.
t can soak in over night
i apply the regular argan oil on my skin at night
the argan oil 'light' during the day
i wake up in the morning
also use it to go to bed at night to help keep my skin nice
refreshed in the morning
i apply this daily in the morning
eye cream at night
i only use a drop during the day
i love putting this on in the evening
i wear it every night
i love putting it on before bed
my favorite part is after i clean my face at night or after i exfoliate i put this stuff on
don't worry if you put it on in the morning or at night before bed
lightweight enough to use morning or night
i go back to this every time
sometimes a little during the day on my dry zones
of course i do use sun screen if outside all day
i like to use it after i wash my face before bed
the only downside is that if you use it at night before going to bed
i always like to wash my face in the morning
i went from using blotting papers every hour
i just started using this last night
waking up this morning i felt a difference in my skin
i put it on before bed
when i put it on that morning
i ended up using less oil absorbing sheets during the day
it is definitely light enough to work during the day
i woke up the next morning after being scared to use it since i had an iffy experience with the sc retinol
the next day my face is soft
am waiting for my skin to adjust a bit before i try to use it twice a day
i will continue to use it each night
couldn't live without this in my night time routine
been using it a lot this summer as a morning cleanser
i hate washing my face in the morning
i love this as the last step in my cleansing routine
pm following with the sos
it's the only thing i use in the morning.
i also like to use this as a refresher mid day
i used this in the morning and at night.
i probably use this every day
love this in the morning or evening as it takes off my makeup
at the same time
like, almost every time i wear it.
also just after i've washed my face as a toner or as a midday "drink" for my face
after i wash it off i'm always happy with the results
nothing has done more during cold weather or after an indulgent evening
made my t-zone very oil throughout the day
i began using it religiously every night leaving it on for about 30 minutes
after a weekend of nonstop drinking
for 3-day straight we party till 3am with lots of drinks
during the vib 20% off sale in the winter
i usually i leave it on overnight
skin so amazing in morning
if i apply it in the morning before i put my makeup on
the key is leaving it on all night
does magical things during the night
i follow up with my regualr regime
the effect lasted till the next day.
used it tonight after work.
it lasts all day.
only every other night
i started work at 9 am the other day
am now on my second bottle
only do it at night
i apply it every morning and every night.
i apply less in the morning
cake it on at night
i apply this before i go to bed
morning + night after washing my face
for someone who has the oiliest of skin a fee hours after cleansing
at night after i wash my face
i am currently on my second bottle of this
or the coldest winter days
i got this in my clinique 10 days calendar for christmas
i feel that it sits heavy on the skin for a minute or two
some mornings i've woken feeling more oily
after using this for only a day or 2 my skin was super moisertized
i used it the night before
in the morning my skin was just as soft
use only half of what you normally would in the morning
i put it on after my shower before bed
i get compiments on my skin on a regular basis.
i am on the dry side
it get the job done in the summer or winter.
great for morning and night!
so the bottle lasts for a while
the peeling was gone the next morning
usually use the gel during the day
i actually use it at night
this is light enough for summer
this is my go-to morning/daytime eye cream!
it became my favorite morning eye cream
on the smell alone i would use it twice a day
feels and looks like i got 8 hours of sleep!
always look super tired in the morning
i feel like i don't look awake in the morning till i put this on my eyes
keeps my eyes looking vibrant even on days i get less than 8 hours of sleep
this is my first time using an eye cream
at night i use my other new favorite
i found it to be more like a day cream then a night cream for me
i used this for a long time until i just recently switched my entire skincare routine over to drink elephant
so just covers me enough during my commute
my go to in the balmier months.
i'll apply my night cream first
i used this in the winter time in the cold new york weather
ready for the day
throughout my years i've always washed my face in the morning
at night with different r
pump bottle for day time use
i used 'the pureness' in my early 20s
i am in my early 30s now
i used it every night after i wash my face.
i am not one to change up my skin routine
for night in spring/summer
all over at night
i put it on after i wash my face in the morning
had dry patches on my face during the winter.
i don't get oily until very late in the day
i feel amazing after applying it every morning
night after i wash my face
have to wait a while in the morning to put my makeup on
i actually look forward to using it at night
is great even at night
i wear it before i go to bed
when i wake up
since my early teens
now in my mid 20's
best used for morning/day time.
i tried it one day
when i wake up
could use it at night since i already have sun protection in my make-up
i personally use it morning and night.
now that i'm in my early twenties
be around people all day
le it for about a minute or two then you're in the home stretch
i usually use these once a day in the morning
around the 5th day of use
i cut the pads in half for morning and night use.
once a day at night during the rest of the year
i noticed instantly that at the end of the day
i literally woke up the next morning
i'll be powering through this daily until the wedding
i saw over-night results
the first night i began the treatment i won't lie
every night after the intensity began to wear down
after one time i saw results.
use them every night before bed
switched to every other night
of course it will sting at first
i got these pads in the acne kit a few days before a job interview
every time i stop
i only use one pad every other night
only use it at night
itching for about a minute
then down to every other day
now i use a pad once a day
i did them everyday for a month
even if i had a zit pop up in the morning it was almost gone by night time
once your skin is through the first week
at night i use it with my clarisonic.
with this in my routine
at night when you are hanging not going straight to sleep apply to your face
i try to do it after a night out
even great to leave on overnight
by morning i am good to go
this will be a staple in my routine
you use it after washing instead of your normal routine 1-2 times a week
the next day my entire face
it was a hot day
eve lom is far better
also, i use the eve lom rescue mask.
i enjoy using it twice a week to vary my routine
i do use this with my clarisonic nightly.
fresh on the second day
i love to use this during the fall
you would need to dedicate at least 15 minutes to your nightly routine to really get the most out of the system since it takes some time to apply
was planning to purchase the cpb cleanser when i came across eve lom
now in my mid 40's
i started using eve lom when i noticed that my other face wash was breaking me out on a daily basis
the result is even greater if i leave the eve lom moisturizing mask on over night
before proceeding on with your skin care routine
throughout the next day
i normally get a pimple or 2 at that time of the month
i look forward to cleansing my face every day.
a different cleanser in the morning to make it last longer
it also gets every last spot of makeup off of my face during my nightly routine
the cleanser takes off everything at the end of the day
the routine is so relaxing
what i find most impressive is that after using eve lom before bed
it became a ritual for me every night
takes more time to cleanse at night
i only use at night since i thought i might get breakouts if used twice a day
i really hope sephora starts carrying eve lom products in store
i now only use eve lom.
the morning time cleanser in the am
take 5 minutes before bed
the tlc cream at night as well
now using this in the evening
i only use at night.
i would love to see sephora carry the eve lom new range of makeup
will get the 6.8oz one later.
after i use this at night
i first tried this when i ordered the travel essentials to try some of the other eve lom products
i follow the application with omorovicza gold night drops
i normally apply it in the morning if i did not have time to apply a mask the night before
leave it on for 20 minutes
leave on your face for 2-3 minutes
i may be switching to this combo permanently for my morning routine
i leave it on for 2 minutes like it says
eve lom's morning time cleanser is a perfect fit for me
this is for use in the morning
i apply this right before i take a shower in the morning
ready for the next step in my morning routine
this is the perfect cleanser to use in the morning when i am only wanting to take off my nighttime serum
i put this on before i step in the shower since you are supposed to leave it on a little while
or a second cleanse in the evening
neck in the morning
i only use it in the evening
this is ideal for me in the mornings
do the rest of my morning business
i just received my eve lom morning cleanser yesterday
after washing my face last night
then again this morning
fast to use when you are in a hurry compared the the regular eve lom cleanser
s before you apply to face
leave on for a few minutes and rinse off.
i leave it on for like 5 minutes
by the end of the day
i'll likely also get the night cream
so using it with verso's night cream in the same day is too much for my skin
i wanted to try the night cream
never at night b/c i build up oil anyway by morning i'm a bottle of olive oil practically
i can wear it during the day
i'll also add that even after i wash my face in the morning
i do not go to bed without putting on this night cream first
i wake up the next day with my skin looking brighter
for night use only
after a month of pretty much nightly use
trying this every other night or every two nights for a week or two
i love putting them on at night because the scent is
i am in my mid-20s
am just beginning to get a few fine lines
i got this night cream
along with the day cream
the very next morning my face was smooth
i feel i am getting a luxury facial every night
i apply the night cream every night before bed
i even use the night cream on my neck
use it every other night to start
i ended up buying the day cream
this has gained a permanent spot in my nightly routine
some mornings as a spot-treatment
i cut back to just using at night
for night use only
after a month of pretty much nightly use
trying this every other night or every two nights for a week or two
i love putting them on at night because the scent is
in the morning you will awake with both plump
i am in my early 40's
actually use it 4-6 nights a week
i wake up each morning looking like i just had a facial
will purchase again along with the night cream!
i will use it as a part of my daily routine as long as i'm around
be sure to put some sunscreen on during the day
it magically disappeared after waking up in the mornings
it lasted me a good 7 nights
with am/pm use
after a week i am at about 50/50
still use my regular eye cream at night.
t was a bit hard for me to give up my usual anti aging one in the morning in lieu of an spf
am still on my first tube
this eye cream does it all for day time.
where we will be out in the sun all day for over a week
when i wake up in the morning
would continue to use this as my morning eye cream
i̇ts perfect for dry skin i̇ start using dreamtone every day morning
i̇ am using the second bottle
on to my next bottle!
i am now on my third bottle
my friend was over at the pool with me the other day
am on my third bottle
next day sun spot gone
then reading other reviews i only put it on once a day
when i used the dreamtone in the morning
i used a sample of dreamtone all over my face before bed one night
they all help with evening your skin tone
saw results in what seemed like overnight
even after a not so great nite of sleep
my skin tone is finally evening out
i look forward to putting this cream on at night before bedtime
it's never too early to start using night creams
i rotate through about three different night creams
it is my "go to" night cream most nights
they are gone in the morning
i like a heavy moisterizer overnight
thought i'd try this night cream
this is the best night cream i've used.
i like to use it day
evening or if i forget to put it on in the evening
i don't have to reapply cream during the whole day
goes a long way night cream
i find that my evening moisturizer sinks in better after using this
i did notice that every couple days i need to use a heavy night cream to get things back in balance
only use it twice a week not every day or my skin will get red
i only use this in the mornings
in the morning by itself
it's not as silky in the morning as i was anticipating
i also use the day and night cream.
this winter took a toll on my skin
is a great pick-me-up in the morning
even before i apply the night cream.
i've also used it overnight
i also love to use it after a hot day.
i woke up the next morning
tonight i put this stuff all over my face
will keep it on overnight
great for this hot summer weather
allow to sit for 10 minutes then wash off it also claims to leave on your face over night for a extreme detoxifying hydrator as i use this 2-3 times per night in a week if my face is extremely dry
smooth until the next morning
leaves my face almost flawless the next morning
left it on over night
this will be my new go to overnight mask
put it in the fridge in the morning
then at night leave it on for an hour
cool when i apply it first thing in the morning
i am still in the dry skin stage
i decided to leave it on for an hour the second time i used it
all at the same time
wash off in more than 20 minutes
i put a thick mask of this on in the evening
i usually use this in the morning
before i go to bed
i put a layer at night and sleep on the mask.
leave it on overnight
i tried this one first and left in on overnight.
then one day i was out of my regular night time moisturizer
i woke up the next morning
the best results are sleeping with this on or keeping it on all day
after sleeping with this i won't even need to moisturize for like 2/3 days after
i left it on overnight.
i also use it on the weekends
leave it on all day/night
i leave this mask on for at least 15-30 minutes to get super soft skin
then use this as the final step before i go to sleep at night
when i wake up
i leave it on overnight
leave it on as you would if you were using this as a overnight masked
like sitting in a cool pool on a hot day
is perfect for early mornings before school
leave it for 30 minutes to an hour
as soon as i put it on i felt my pores waking up!
last night i used it for 20-30 minutes
left it on for hours
i leave it on overnight 3 times a week
i put it on at night
the next morning i wasn't as red
putting it on before bed every night
just rinsing it off in the morning
wear it over night
especially applying it on a hot day/night after it's been sitting in the fridge
by the time i wash it off
the next morning my skin is bright
<which is almost all year round haha >
great for a quick eye depuff in the morning also.
this is perfect for the morning
at the end of an average day it is enough to wash with this followed by moisturizer
by the end of the work day
after this step i apply moisturizer: at night-time i currently use dr
it's a great cleanser for the morning to wake me up
when i get back from my daily bike ride after work
i can smell it hours after i apply.
my all-year-around, everyday staple.
i usually use this stuff in my night time skin care routine
i only use it at night as i'm hesitant makeup may slide off if i use it in the morning
i went all weekend without it
especially during the wintertime
i only use it once a day right before bed
the softness lasts all the way until i wash my face in the morning
at night i wash with the clarisonic
i am normal to dry
after 2 days my skin is all good an back to normal
i apply two to three drops twice daily either before my moisturizer or mixed in with it
i apply it at night over my retin a product
i wouldn't apply it during the day
i look forward to putting this on in the am
pm as it is so soothing
fresh after i use it
not be broken out in the morning
usually by noon my skin has already felt dry
i probably will only use it occassionly in the summer while it's humid out
my skin was transformed overnight
literally over night my skin was 50% better
i just applied this morning
the first night my skin was so dry i remembered i had this sample in my bag
it was my first stop the next morning to buy the full tube
would use it occasionally at night
with the winter in full swing
i got it on monday
that later in the day my dry patches would come back
use it every morning.
making it perfect for daytime
every morning when i wake up my skin feels fresh
i can comfortably wear foundation during the day to the office
start again the next day
f i use it durning the day i focus it more on my dry parts
at night i lather this on
leave it on overnight and you'll wake up glowing.
i am finally at the end of my tube
by the end of the day
apply this cream before bed
before i go to bed
s were next morning
the next day i'd be a disaster zone
i picked this up last weekend as a 100 point perk
evening as a night cream
also throughout the day
while a moisturizer helped to solve this right after the face wash it would be the same next day
it seemed to work before i went to sleep
conditions that i went through
when i woke up
so of course i went back to sephora that day
tried this one in store today
prepping it to receive either my day or night cream
see how it goes through out the week
am about to buy my third tube of the cream
now that the weather in new engl
i pair this with the ceramidin cream in the winter
in the summer heat i used it on it's own
in only 3 nights of using this
may have to check my bag on every trip now just
ifi need held it topit off with a sleeping mask or the belifmoisturizing cream
the same day i applied it
will not leave my routine
every morning before i put on makeup
in one day my sun burn started to disappear.
at lunch my skin was flaky again
continued using is each night
the ceramidin cream in the pm
i am on my second bottle.
every day is a good skin day
pm for a few days
come day three i was amazed at the results
i apply this before my night cream
when i am extra dry
i put it on immediately after washing my face in the morning
s in the winter
s in the summer
this winter was brutal in the northeast
recently i was outside for several hours in 10 degree windy weather
even when i fell asleep with only this product on
i still woke up the next morning with soft skin
a little bit in the morning before makeup
i saw results overnight!
after 9 hours at work my face still looks so fresh
the first day i used it i noticed a glow.
i am on week 2
i used this moisturizer on a daily basis both in the morning
i love how it feels in the morning when i wake up
nights when i don't use it i definitely notice a difference the next morning
brightens up after a week
i then use the night cream with it and man!
my skin was looking a little aged from working outside in the sun this summer
i'll keep using it at night untill the weather cools off to use during the day
i used this before i went to bed
i did not start to take care of my skin daily till i turned 26
this is best used in the shower
left on your face for 3+ minutes
i like using this in the morning since its gentle
i only wash my face twice a day
i put on retin a at night
this is the perfect choice for the morning wash
i almost forgot to put on moisturizer this morning
i am on the second bottle now.
am now on bottle 2
of course i still break out a little around my monthly cycle
multiple compliments on my skin this week after using this line
until i found this product
i switched to ibuki for the wintertime
only use water to wash my face in the morning after using this product
i am 29 with no sun damage
use this one at night
for me it lasts all day.
i also use it as a night cream year round
dewey all day long
i apply on clean skin every morning
before sleep at night for a month now
i literally have people ask me on a weekly basis
great for daytime before makeup or night.
even during humid east coast summers i think the weight will be appropriate
it is perfect for me day or night before i apply my make up or go to bed
evening out my skin tone
i will say that i use to live in high humidity on the east coast
once in the morning
then once at night because i work out a lot
have to give my face a good scrub every night
perfect for fall-winter
i am on my third jar of this
i am back on this stuff again
i sometimes get a little oily if i wear it during the day for long hours
i slather it on at night
the mornings after i use it at night
only use it at night
i am in my late 20s
i apply it at night
i began using this product on a friday
i can still use it during the day
on the 4th day and will update later.
t's good for night cream or use in the winter time
i love putting it on at night
it made my face so soft day and night.
the results were overnight
this is my first time leaving a product review on sephora
i will continue to use this only for night time
stick with what works during the day
it was only useful at night since it makes it skin oily during the day
great for night time
i am also able to use morning
after i use the shiseido eudermine
during the winter it more on the dry side
i happened to come across this while window shopping at sephora
i work 13-16 hours every day so this has been a god-send
after using this just once overnight
i always wake up after using it at night with my face not even slightly greasy
leaves it baby soft when i wake up in the morning
i am also using algenist pore products during the day as well
i usually use small amount once daily at night
i'll use the rest for night and dr. jart for day.
when i wake up in the morning
perfect for use both in the morning and at night.

i apply it morning and night after toner.
i wear it during the day under my make-up

i love this stuffi normally use it before a night out
it smells like walking through a rose garden in the spring after a rain storm

after trying this with a clarisonic at night
i now look forward to washing my face before bed!
am going to get a full bottle tomorrow

this is one of the best night masks i've used
waking up in the morning my face is soft

this is great i use it as a nightly moisturiser
brighter in the morning
like any mask though i only use it a few nights a week
washing it off in the morning
like the title of this review says this boscia mask is the answer to my nightly skin routine prayers

when i wake up the next morning
i'd wake up to smooth skin every morning
my skin looks so dewey after i wash my face in the morning
i put this on at night
i don't end up with dry patches by the end of the day
i put it on at night
wake up with baby bottom smooth skin in the morning <3 the sephora employee who recommended this to me even suggested to put it on during the day if needed
i only put it on places where i'm the driest for daytime usage
i went through a really dry stage with my skin earlier this winter
how fresh my skin looks the next morning
the following morning my skin is baby soft
when i put this at night i wake up with my skin feeling much much better
i do so about an hour before going to bed.
no residue or film left in the morning.
when i woke up this am my skin was smoother
refreshed in the morning
you just leave it on over night
i used a sample pack of this last night that came with my "girl on the fly set"
in the middle of winter
the next morning my face was so smooth
when you wake up the next day
i put this on before i go to bed when i wake up my face feels like "baby skin"
typically when i know i am going to be putting on a full face of makeup the next day
entire day my face is just glowing
just every minute or
it stays that way until i wash it off in the morning
i also use tsubaki oil in the morning
to the point where i don't have dry skin the nights after i use it
began using this mask every night as a night cream for 4 days straight
i would wake up to soft
i worked it into my routine at night
glowing face every morning
i just put on instead of night cream
i went to sephora for a night cream
i apply a very little at night
i follow with the tsubaki oil when i wake up
especially in the winter time.
i put this on all over my face overnight
when i wake up in the morning
after i wash it off
results fade after cleansing in the am

i actually use this 5-6 nights a week on my face
i just put on a thin layer at night before i go to bed
i might start using it every night
ed on your face overnight
renewed your skin overnight
so you need to put this on a least an hour before bed for it to dry down that is why it gets four stars instead of five
i am only planning on putting it on my h
i layer this on top of my kiehls routine in the evening
in the morning i feel like that opening scene in cinderella where the birds
i put it on before bed
this cream should only be used before bed as it is too heavy on the skin for daytime use
then it will get oily an hour later
in the office or at home the air is just dry
i wanted to try it out as a night cream
only wear it before bed
at first i thought that it was too thick for daytime
put it on before bed
it stays that way all day or night
occasionally during the day if i don't go outside
it is very good to use at night so you wake up
to start your day off well.
use their day cream as well
it is perfect to just get it back up after one application over night
when i wash in the morning
i look forward to my new night routine because of this product
let that set about 5 minutes
i wake up feeling not as dry in the morning
mainly in the night time right before bed
i packed a different product by mistake on a recent beach trip
i work the night shift
this helped a bit and it's only the 3rd day!
i look more awake at least.
night every day since i have purchased it
great for morning or night.
after putting it on my h
then wait a minute or two before putting makeup on
up 3-5 times per night
very calming before bed
never go in the sun
i apply before bed and wake up wrinkle free.
really dry at the same time
my makeup during the day has even been staying better
i am in my mid-20s
i decided to give this a try as a night time moisturizer to switch out my drug-store night cream which was no longer cutting it for me
use this product morning
works as a good hand cream at night also!
it's not that day and night.
i put it on at night
when i wake up in the morning my skin is visibly brighter
it's for use at day
night meaning one less product for my traveling beauty bag
i put it on at night
when i wake up in the morning
i applied this at night after cleansing
n the morning before my makeup
i am hooked on this moisturizer until i can see results from another br
this was too heavy for me as a day cream
tried it at night
if i put this on at night i wake up to better looking skin
i used it every night for a week
tried it just for fun as a night cream
the first night i woke up in the morning with skin smooth
am enjoying it while it lasts
i get greasy in the matter of hours
used this 3 mornings in a row
in the evening after cleansing
i saw results in just a week.
after the first day i immediately saw a difference
the next morning my skin was amazing
i put this on for the first time
it helped control oil on my nose for hours afterwards even in the summer
sensitive at the same time
i can use this under makeup during the day without getting shiny by the end of the day
after 5-10 minutes of wearing it i don't even notice a smell
frigid winter was ending
when winter comes around again
nstead i use it at night along with the rest of my routine before i go to bed
i just was using it at night.
in the morning my face was firm
i just started the nightly routine with this cream so hope it's a keeper
i only put it on once in the evening as my skin is fine without more
i can wear it at night
the next morning my skin felt refreshed.
probably best as a night cream
love it for daytime.
the minute i put it on
although i am over 45
not even every day
one night i ran out of my night cream
i only used it at night
i used half a pack a day
when i used another night cream after it
after a few hours could get a bit greasy
i recommend this more as a night cream for them
instead of using up an entire packette each day
i'll be using this as a night cream
i am only using this in the evening since it may be too much during this very humid weather time of the year
i actually look forward to washing my face even when i'm dead tired after a 12 hour day
i will keep using this mask weekly!
i would recommend putting this on at night right before bed then do an astringent
i woke up in the morning
even an hour after using it i cant stop touching my face
i like to indulge in a mask at the end of my weekend if time permits
tried it the first night
then over the next two nights after waking up for work i noticed lightening effects
waking up each day i saw more
i used this mask for the first time last night
i never leave the house without make up on usually
my skin looks great on the following morning
the next morning i woke up my skin was more even toned
when i wake up
tried it last night
in the middle of summer heat
when i wake up in the morning im usually very oily
ter the night before
washing my face at night
in the morning my face is not oily when i wake up
i will keep this product in my daily routine!
this actually got the oil off every night
great for using in the shower or on its own!
so washing my face with this in the morning
night really helped control my oil during the day
yes i did the steam room thing multiple times
when i wake up in the morning my skin is softer than a babys bottom
where it's extremely humid during the summer months
i wouldn't use it year round
i don't have any oil on my face when i wake up on the morning
as in the humid summers my face was greasy in two hours
on the same spots
i love how bright my skin is in the morning after i wash my face
i put it on about 30 minutes before bed
i am in my mid 50's.
i've actually been using it during the day under makeup or bare-faced bc i use my spot treatment at night
night i would cleanse the area
when night time came i would apply it
leave it over night
i started an everyday night/ morning routine
i used it everyday for a week
this is the best sleeping mask i've used to date.
after finally putting an end to my years of sunbathing
holy guacamole tonight is my third night in a row sleeping in this mask
if i wear it at night
my skin was so bright the next morning!
i just got this night must
simple: wash face before bed
then put this over it to sleep
nstead i just use it in the evening between getting home
i am on my second bottle
i've used it nightly for a week
my skin is improving day by day
when i woke up the next day after wearing the sleeping mask my face was brighter
when i wake up in the morning the redness
i wear this twice a week.
i do the whole-night routine
use this at night even around my eyes
sleep on my face
just smooth this on clean skin in the evening
wash off in the morning
i did wake up one morning with a few new whiteheads after using this
i plan on buying a bottle as soon as i run out of my current sleeping mask
went home that night
i woke up the next morning
using this after workouts
within one week of using the serum at night before bed other people noticed how great my skin was looking
pm whenever i wash my face really
i usually sleep very late
typically get 4-5hours of sleep
this sleeping mask literally makes me look like i had full 8 hours of sleep
i used it mostly during night
i felt like my face was too sticky throughout the night when i used it as an overnight mask
leave on for 15-20 minutes
smooth not only the next morning
when i used it as an overnight mask
i can´t answer at this time
i tried this overnight mask
i put it on before bed
i put this mask on at night
i used it every night
the very first night i applied individually on each spot
in 10 minutes that is special in my book.
leave it on for 10 minutes
i get 7 hours of sleep
i do both morning
i am in my early 20s
i used it only at night
i am in my late 20s
i only use this in the morning
fresh looking when i wear this at night
i will say i only use this as my night time eye cream
after i apply to the eye area
i used it morning and night.
work a 12 hour job as an emergency 911 call taker
i apply it mornings
reach for it every morning
a half in the morning
i apply this cream every night
i went in today to look again
after one apply each night with a little fingers massage
try a sample when you go on your next sephora trip
using it just at night
t will last a while
cause from staying up late
good pick me up in the morning
i waited a while before posting a review
i used this morning, and night.
at the end of the day
the effects last even on days when i'm lazy
t's great for at night
on the third or fourth night
i only use 1-2 drops in the morning
i put this on day
at night i also put on glamglow's blue mask on top of it
now i do that every night
i decided to try one night
i applied it at night
in the morning when i woke up my skin felt super smooth
the next morning my makeup goes on flawless
i do not have shine in the morning
i only use at night
got two nightly uses out of it
night for about a week
chose to use it at night
tried it out this morning
used it before bed
i used it again in the morning
i applied it at night after i washed my face.
after a couple of hours i went to the restroom
saw results the next morning
this in the pm
enjoy using it at night
i wish i could wear it during the day!!
night after i wash my face
i tried it before going to sleep one night
the next morning i woke up with beautiful
can't wait for the big bottle to arrive.
so after washing my face at night i put this on right after
you just sleep with it on
its so dry to the point where when i wake up
i apply this before i go to bed
i press this into damp skin morning
my skin just drinks it in seconds!
the fine lines on my face look so much better in the morning
in the cold northeast i always use a serum under my moisturizer in the fall through the spring
i also use it in the afternoon to give my skin a moisture boost
i like to use this at night time every now
33 oz bottle didn't even last a month of me just using it in the evenings
the three drops that i use a night go quickly
only used it at night
my skin tone is evening out
an amazing gift for your skin after a day in the sun
at this point in my life
after spending a lot of time in the sun
evening for a week now
applying it at night only
i apply it after cleansing at night
the next morning my face is so smooth in the shower
it cannot be applied at all in the morning
especially in the fall/winter
now i live in a dry windy place
stay away all day
on some days when my skin is super dry when i wake up
let it sit for about 15 minutes
one quick layer before i go to bed
when i wake up
i would leave this on for a few hours while i'm at home
this overnight mask is always in my routine
i put this on right before bed every night
looks restored in the morning
miserable winter where i live
this is the only wash-off mask i am using during these months with my towel
didn't try it until i ran out of my night cream
i put it on after my shower one night
this one didn't make it greasy at all plus the results lasted past when i washed my face in the morning
then use this mask either for a half hour or overnight
i leave it on overnight
i leave it over night
recommended i put it on during the flight home
left it on for 15 minutes
the next morning my skin looked so even
i put it on at night
sleep with it on when i want my skin to look great the next day
tried this as an overnight mask
i let it soak in for an hour or so
i just let the thirstymud sink right in for the rest of the evening
i also love it on my lips at night!
i won't use it as a night cream at that time of year
after applying it overnight
massage in before i get out
when i wake up in the morning my skin looks
keeps soaking in for hours which i appreciate.
i put a layer on before a flight once
i did it overnight
by morning it's like i spent a day at the spa
when i wake up after using this product
always use it the first night
my skin is back to normal the next day
i put this on after i shower
i got this in the holiday set
using as night mask in
i used it over night
it made my skin smoother for the following day
love this during the winter season .
after washing my face of course
i definitely look brighter when i wake up in the morning
i used it every night for a week
i can tell a difference in my skin the next morning
i put it on after washing my face and go to bed.
when i wake up
i notice that my face soaks up more of the products when i leave it on all night vs
i saw results after one use.
the next morning his pimple was gone
after using josie maran moroccan oil that dried out my face one evening
i apply it once to twice a week at night
then after that day your skin goes back to how it was before
then run it in before i go to bed
the morning after, you're just glowing!
great for the winter time
especially in the winter !
put it on over night
when i awake in the morning
lasted through the night
have never come across a better night time cream
especially for the winter
i apply it once in the morning before leaving to work once before going to bed
i used this once at night
i often have a hard time forcing myself to go through my skin care regimen at night
i only apply this at night time
pat into my skin after using all my other nightly items
for days i'm staying in i use it during the day because nobody will be seeing my shiny face :
i've used it in the morning
one morning i was really dry
when i started trying this one in the evening
when i wake up in the morning
night infusion together at night give me incredibly smooth skin
i could see a difference after only one night
i am wary to try it as a day creme that would go on before my primer
i used it only at night for 4 days
i love it for nighttime.
its so perfect in the winter!
only at night because i have combination skin
i am in my late 30's
i've put it on am
lasts an entire day til washed off
other days, i just roll with it :)
a day at the beach
i would say i usually wait only 10-15 minutes after applying this to start on my eye makeup
when i apply it in the morning sometimes i'll forget i put it on
on lazy nights or nights when i'm too tired for my entire skincare routine
this gets that last stubborn bit off at night
i tend to use this in the morning instead of a full cleansing routine
just to do that at night
lovely in the morning.
at the end of the day
in the morning before i exercise
it takes the night off my face
then i can easily prep for the day
i used this for the first time tonight
i wear 24 hour make foundation
before i use this
i've always had difficulty getting 100% of my makeup off at night
wash at the same time
after reading the review on clinique'stake the day off
it's now part of my nightly routine.
"take the day off"
take the day off is h
use it every night
i live in humid sofla
i usually use this once a day to take my make up off
just remember to give it a few minutes before applying makeup
it says ladies saw results in as little as 4 weeks so stay tuned ok girls
used it almost every day until it ran out
my makeup lasted well throughout the day
wear well during a long work day
pm which works great
i put it on after my moisturizer etc in the morning
also use the night cream love both
i spent an afternoon with a sephora rep
sometimes i'll use it mid day or under my makeup where my heavy duty daily moisturizer would just cause my foundation to separate
i personally use it in the morning
soft all day long
i work this into my morning
i just moved from dry heat in arizona to the humid northeast
using it at night it works more like a night time mask
during the winter i like to use the cream version
especially like it when i use it at night
i also love that it can double as a night cream
this is my first time to use fresh
i put it on my face in the mornings.
the cream version at night
which i am using for night
before i go to bed
my favorite way to use it is to actually sleep with it on
wake up to the best skin!
forgot about it until today
i used this on weekly basis for a while
do the mask literally the morning of a day when i'll be out
i used this mask last night for the first time
when i woke up this morning
use it twice a week before bed
when i wake up in the morning
she told me to put the mask on three times a week before i go to bed
after an hour after removing the mask
great mask to use at night or after the shower.
i apply it once a week at night to clean damp skin
when i wake up the next morning my skin is radiant
at least the day u use it
leave it on for 10 minutes or so
you get a fresh look in 2-3 minutes
my skin looks great the next day after i use it in the evening
i mask every 2-3 days, depending on my schedule.
i leave it on for 1 hour
oily spots were evening out
where do i begin?
the 1st time i used it
at the first try
i put it on the night i went to the beach
even more so the next morning
amazing results after just one 20 minute mask.
i can not wait for my full bottle to arrive.
goin to try round 2 tonight!!
after a trip to the desert where i failed to use sunblock
left it on for 10 minutes
i leave it on as a spot treatment
this morning i woke up n it was completely gone
in the mornings for over a month
the next morning once the product soaked in
within one night my skin felt 80% back to normal
i wear this every day
too thick to use at night.
decécolleté area in the morning
really wakes up your senses in the morning
it also lasts throughout the day
it didn't make my face break out or get super oily by noon
it kind of helps wake me up in the morning
he uses this at night
i put a few drops of this on an napped for two hours
have put this on night
i only use 3 drops in the morning
every time i walk past the mirror in the morning
because i thought i would reduce the darkness over time
cold on my undereye in the morning
it lasts all day
applied before any other products in the morning
ive been using it every night before bed.
some days i just wear this
on days when i didn't get as much sleep or i have the time to dress-up
i love this eye cream for the morning!
i've loved putting this on in the morning cause the metal sort of wakes you
this really wakes up my face in the morning.
especially when i have to go to work the next morning at 600 am
sleep or no sleep!
as if i haven't slept in days
if i am rushing out of the house or running late
every time i fly somewhere
this product is a lifesaver to help my eyes in the morning
really helps me wake up in the morning
ncredibly refreshing in the morning
especially if i dont get a full nights sleep
literally the morning after i put it on i noticed a difference in my under eye area
i put this on at night
weekends when i'm chilling at home
dab on at 5am before ice fishing to look awake
personally use a different eye cream at night
i am on my second tube now.
since it was the only way of trying this mask outside of praying for a bi points reward one day or splurging $59 on the full size
honestly i saw the results the next day my face was brighter
woke up after first time wearing it
i saw this at sephora
j typically leave it on for 20 minutes
used it this evening
the next morning my face is clear
wake up to beautiful skin the next morning
i like putting in on before the shower
i leave it on overnight
i leave the mask on for a minimum of 10 minutes
i will use this mask for 6 more times before my vacation
today was just day 2.
which i just started last night
i am using it every day in the morning
used it as an overnight mask
when i feel i need an extra boost during the day
irritated in the morning
i can wear this on a 8 hour day
this is my go to in the morning.
it feels so luxurious on the skin i am amazed by this product just after 2 full days of usage
the experience was a relaxing way to end the day.
is best as a morning or second cleanse
use it every other nite.
look forward to this routine every night
this is a relaxing way to cleanse that i will enjoy a few times a week before bed :
i just enjoy cleaning my face at the end of the day
i always double cleanse at night.
a delight to use every night
told me to use it as a overnight mask
after waking up the next day my skin felt beautiful
when i first apply
i try to leave it on over the recommended time
i left it on overnight
leave it on for an hour or more
after a long day of sweating
i left it on for 20 minutes
washed it off after about 10 minutes
i literally use a mask every night
i leave it on overnight
and i sleep at night with it on.
left on over night
my normal routine is putting the mask on before i go to bed
sleep with it on
i used this mask overnight
give it time to work overnight
when i wake up
wake up the next day with the most clear smooth skin ever
i woke up the next day
i've continued using it every night
into the next morning
i used it this evening.
i tried it twice at room temperature
left it on for about a half hour after a shower
sometimes overnight so when i wash it off in the morning my face is all ready primed for makeup
i opened it last night
if i'm tired or hungover
i love the ritual of putting it on
when i woke up this morning went
i looked fantastic the next morning every girl need this as her post party weekend treatment
when i woke up the next morning
wanted to do the overnight
nstead i kept it on for a few hours at night before i went to bed
could check up on it every once in a while
i apply it every other day for 15-20 mins.
i did the overnight treatment
i left it on for the 10 minutes
i'll see if this repeats
i left it on for 10 minutes
i woke up today
this mask is everythingg after a long day 10/10
i love using it overnight
leave it on throughout the day
after washing my face in the morning
leaving it on all day
i leave on for 20 minutes
i apply it and leave it on overnight.
this is my official i-need-to-wake-up-now mask!
i put it on in the morning when i need to refresh my skin
get ready for an early day
when i woke up the next day my skin was brighter
people use masks at night time
by the time you wake up it will be back to normal
it does leave it red for about half an hour
wait a few minutes before going to bed
as an overnight treatment
wash it off after 10 minutes
'll probably only use this before bed
apply this after your nightly regimen
sleep with it on
after using this mask overnight
i used this as a treatment on my day off
you are missing out on the best night time moisturizer i have ever used
if you leave it on all night
i used it last night as a mask
i also mixed it in with my night cream
slept with it on
perfect for the summer!
i woke up in the morning
i only use this about every other day or at night with a heavier moisturizer
by morning my skin was back to normal
i will say i only use it at night.
i tried the first week using it in the morning as well
so i switched to using it in the morning.
after 3 or 4 nights of using it
overall i look froward to washing my face every morning
which makes for a really nice pre-bedtime routine
i used it in the shower
i only use it in the morning to start off my day
night after taking off all my make up
i used it as an overnight mask.
smooth when i wake up
i put it on at night after cleansing
when i woke up in the morning i felt as if i didn't even need to apply moisturizer
even after my multi-step nighttime routine
my old foundation would be running down my face at the end of a 12hr work day
it lasts all day without a touch up.
while evening out your skin tone
ready to face the day
balm then i am ready to go
use it almost every day
put it on in the morning before work
am only about 1/3 through the bottle
it lasted me all day with my man
can wear it during the summer
before i found this
at the end of the day
it stays on and on and on.
i wear it every day.
i noticed this morning that i'm almost out
also, it last all day and into the night.
it tones down after an hour
after walking around the store for an hour
not at all greasy by the end of the day
t will last a while
after that, my face was set for the day.
i didn't have to reapply throughout the day
this is my all time absolute favorite foundation for summer time
am not sure if i will still be able to pull this off in the depths of winter when i am at my palest
the level of oiliness i end up with at midday is so negligible that after using this for almost a year
i find it easy to put on in the morning on top of the bb cream
perfect for hot days.
i am going on my third bottle.
i find it lasts all day
it is a must for monday mornings
puffy faced from lack of sleep or an all nighter out with your buddies or a long day at the office
i prefer to use the product at night even though it's advertised as a "wake up call"
use it right after a shower
i put a little bit on in the morning
a night out or just part of my regular routine i love using this product
use an extra pump on days i have go into work with a hangover
all worked well as night oil
fantastic overnight face oil
if i sleep with the mask on
probably only use it when i'm giving myself a spa day
i am using it over the ren rose face oil at night
light at the same time
i follow with a night cream
love thisi brought detox one as wellno breakoutsput it on in the morning before my day cream
the next morning my skin was softer than ever before
i used it again the next night
can't wait to add it to my nightly routine
i apply at night before bed
use another eye cream in morning
i really saw a difference when i stop using it when i was on vacation for 2 weeks
more awake appearance after one night
that little spot on my h
when i come back to start my makeup minutes later
then again with my nightly regimen before bed
i'd apply it at night
it would be absorbed by morning
now that it is nearly june i have found that when i apply it at night it still feels tacky in the morning
on its own at nighttime
definitely suggest as a nightly routine eye gel before bed
stay smooth throughout the day
i can still feel the gel on my eyes during mid day
combined with a good night's sleep
only use it at night
this is my favorite for day time
when i wake up in the morning my eyes don't feel dry
i am new to the eye cream game
this cream has made me feel human again in the morning
love using this at night during
i wear it every morning after i use the face cream from the same rose line before i put on my "lady armour"
every evening before i turn in
sometimes during the day
really wakes you up in the morning
i am in my late 20s
and by the 3rd day my eyes were perfect!!
t's great in the morning
i've used it just about every morning
every time i apply this to my under-eye area
i work in the sun
at night however i use a little extra.
i apply twice daily
cover it with another eye cream at night
i look at them after
the second strip refreshed
i would use it every day!
night cream religiously for a week now
night cream in one unit
the night cream was good
i tried the night time cream first and loved it.
i like both the night
i tried the night cream first
i used the am one the next morning
i like that it has spf for day
after the first day/night application
suggest putting it on at the beginning of your routine
night time eye cream
i usually leave this on for 15 min.
along with regular skin routine
use the supermud every day
its the 4th time i use it
fell asleep with it on one night
after rinsing in the morning no problem
like a reset for the beginning of the week
it went away the next day after putting some on the spot treatment the night before
i used this last night because of how congested
let dry for 15-20 minutes
at the same time
i like using it after an intense workout
i left it on for 10 minutes
this morning when i woke up my face was very smooth looking
masks almost every night after my cleansing routine
always use this on sunday nights
leave it on about 15/20 min
i left it one for about an hour because it just felt so good on my skin
the next morning i used water to soften the product on my face
it did go back to normal over night which is good
i wake up refreshed
the morning after the first use i noticed my face looked brighter
something made me open it one night
the next morning i was very happy to see my skintone looked more even in just one night
enjoying the cooling relief it gave during the warm months here in the midwest
it's meant to be used at night
i usually use this eye cream in my night routine
night even though it says to use it at night
i don't use this every night
it feels like it's lifting my eyelids so that they are held up while i sleep
i put on at night
i am shocked at the difference within a week
perfect for a late night remedy.
put it on the night before
have used it every night
saw results the next day
got this eye cream, used it for a couple nights.
great too for evening out after a long day.
you need to apply the gel at least 15 minutes before you go to bed
i only use it at night
i do see a difference when i wake up in the morning
it helps me prep for my morning make up
i only use this at night time
i don't look tired in the morning
no bags or darkness under my eyes this morning
i put it on for an overnight treatment.
in the morning i had no puffys around my eye
i just ordered it the other day
it is meant for night use
i also use it in the morning
then i let that rest for a bit until i move on to the rest of my makeup routine
during the day i use my shiseido eye cream.
had to try the night gel
the cream is meant for day
i will continue to use this at night
this is a night gel only to be used only while sleeping
when i wake in the morning
it doesn't last until the next morning.
on nights i don't use it i have serious bags
also notice the difference if i skip a few nights not using
i peel them off in the morning
i only use it at night
after one use at night i woke up in the morning
only use it at night before bed
i don't use this exclusively at night.
sometimes when i wake up in the morning
one night after a long day
my skin felt much more firm than usual the next morning
since it's just for overnight
it's to sticky to stay awake for long with it
which means i stay up late
still get up for my 8am starting time
it's only left on for 3-5 minutes
every time i use it at night
you're only supposed to keep it on for 3-7 minutes
i only leave it on for 2
in the morning about 3/4 of the spots were completely gone
i woke up looking like myself the next day
i saw results the first time i used it :
used this for the first time this evening
i used it last tuesday
i woke up in the morning
i try this mask the moment it arrive
it is a huge part of my weekly skin care routine.
i keep this in my shower
i would suggest starting at 3 minutes then working your way up
it does sting after 5 minutes
i've used it in the morning before work
i didn't just start with 12% glycolic every night
after a couple minutes of hearing him dramatize the burning sensation
glowing the next morning
i put it on about once a week at night
i did that the second time
use it at night
will use it weekly
celebrated the first day of fall by doing this mask with my friends
i will definitely be working this into my weekly routine
i looked at my skin in the bathroom at work today
it does sting/burn for the first 1-2 minutes
i leave on my face for over recommended time though since i am a male
after leaving this on my skin for 10 minutes my face was glowing
i left it on for 20 minutes.
refreshed after using it
i put it on my face in the beginning of my shower
this is what i use every saturday
it does burn a little bit for a minute or two in the beginning
it gets better after the first minute
never mind the results i saw the next morning!
after i wash it off
that's using it twice a day
after the first day i saw
i am not one to take the time
would i use this day and night?
refreshed i use it every morning
its like a summers eve wash for your face
red spots daily- am/pm under my moisturizer
i really like this as a night cream.
used only at night.
until i found this
before finishing with this cream
skip one day because i'm tired
after the first night using it
i only put it on at night after cleansing
since it’s working while i sleep
the first morning i marveled at how soft my skin was
since i only smell it for a little while before i go to sleep
even when i waited an hour to put makeup on it just didn't work
i do find it a bit greasy to use in the morning before my foundation routine
'd recommend using it as a night cream
my makeup a good hour before being with my husb
when i apply at night
every time i put this on my clean face
fine lines at about the 4-6 week mark
one night after cleansing my face
the first night i used it
the day i woke up i noticed that my skin is healthy
i used 2 pumps every night.
if applied in the morning
the sample lasted 4 nights
i only use half a pump of the serum in the morning
at first i didn't notice
i wake up every morning with nary a bag
i came home with a bit of a sunburn on my face after a day at the park
faded it by the next morning
usually at night i'm afraid to go to bed right after moisturizing because it end up on my pillowcase instead
bought a bottle of each the same day
this healed my skin 100% by just putting it on my face for 2 nights
i used it morning & night for three days.
i need less day/night cream when i use it
i did notice that if i put some of the cream under my eyes in the morning
i am in my early 20s
when i did they seemed to stay on my face for weeks
now am in my second large bottle
i used it morning
i would never use a cleanser before in the morning only water
every night before bed
every morning when i wake up i notice my face is radiant
at this point in my life
i wear this at night with the korres rose night cream
i can't wait to see the results after a month.
and only has made my mornings longer.
i like to use this alone during the day
under it at night
it lasts all day into the night
i only use it at night
i am in my early 30s
i left a review on the night cream by mistake :
i do use the black pine night cream every night as well
i put it on at night
while browsing in sephora one day
woke up one day
the next morning i am good to go with brighter
at the end of the day
massage for a second minute
leave on for a minute
i leave on for 2-3
i love that it only takes a minute or two in the morning
do try to use this every other day or every 3rd day
if you leave it on in the wet state for more than the recommended minute
because it does separate after opening
firmer at the same time
leave for at least 5 more minutes like a mask
i just had that "8 hour sleep
i'd suggest just using it at night right before you go to bed
i used it last night
every few days ill use flash rinse in the morning
sometimes ill use before a night out for the same effect
this is now my mid-week mask
that too in only a minute
which i appreciated after a rough night
after using in the morning
i love to use it right when i wake up before i apply makeup
this pair will be my new weekly treatment.
didn't use it until yesterday
after one full day so
didn't have to wait to continue on to the next step in my skincare routine
i used this at night after washing my face.
wore longer throughout the day
i am usually oily within an hour
by the night time
am not parched by lunch
i just put it on alone at night
before serum at night only
i applied this after cleansing my face at night
the very next morning, i could see a difference.
depending on the season
after using this at night
i really like it as a first serum at night
i've noticed that after the 3rd or 4th day of using it
2 pumps in the morning
i've used it before bed once a day
i only used one pump that night
in the morning too
after using it the first night
plumped the next morning
have incorporated it into my morning/nightly skin care routine
chose to use this only at night
spring when the weather changes
i will be switching to the cream in the winter
i put this on at night before bed after all of my other skin care
right before i go to sleep
i usually apply this mask during the evenings
go to bed at night
i can use this mask every day
i will keep it on overnight
the best for when i've had a long day of makeup or traveling
occasionally i will sleep in it
i left it on for about an hour
next morning my skin was baby soft
happy the next morning
it's like my skin went from tired to awake.
i can see this being amazing during the summer as well after a day in the sun
when i put this on the next day my skin is glowing
i kept it on for about 30 minutes and wow!
i normally remove my make-up 1st
let it soak in overnight
you can also wash in the morning
there are occasional nights where i will take an extra make-up removing wipe
i received this product in sephora's travel pack they had this summer
i swear- rub it around for at least 1 minute
i find this cleanser really takes my make up off at the end of the day
am just starting to run out
it wasn't until i started using this regularly
then do a second cleanse with this product at night or use it in the morning
the algenist will pick up what the take the day doesn't compleletely take off
i let it sit for a few minutes when i have on makeup then wet
whenever i set my full coverage foundation with powder for that extra 5 hour lasting power because i work as a nurse
no more sleeping in makeup at night!
on days when i skip makeup
i left it overnight.
also easy to wash the next day morning.
i managed to use each one for a morning
evening application to the eye area
after about 3 weeks of using this product i was putting my makeup on while chatting on the phone
after an hour or so my eyes feel dry again.
by morning it was gone
smooth by the morning
i only apply this at night
though i run in the early morning pre-sunrise
it only lasts for about 5 minutes after you wash your face
clinique take the day off balm this year
decided to try it tonight after a long day of full face makeup
i don't use this as part of my daily routine
just remember to use this first with dry h
i used this last night and it was awesome.
i wake up in the morning
if i'm using it during the day
i tried this first during a makeover at sephora
i massage this in for a few minutes
i used it in the am
i will use it in the mornings, though!
i look forward to washing my face at night for the first time in my life
my morning makeup routine remains fine
used it last night after a full coverage makeup day to really test it
i see a difference when i use this product after one day
this will be a staple in my routine from now on.
just rinse off in the shower because i wear lancôme 's 24 hour foundation
at night i put a bit on my upper eye
i used it twice a day, morning and night.
since i have started to use this serum morning
it doesn't work overnight
i will put a thin layer all over my face than put the night a mins night cream over it before going to bed
and that's just over night of use.
before my night a mins
i like using this in the winter.
helps maintain my day time make up through the day
i don't like wearing foundation on a regular basis
works great on my skin for day or night use.
i am in my early 20's
i plan on continuing to wear it on a daily basis
within a day or two get compliments on my skin
even the next morning.
looking fresh all day
in the summer i can wear it on its own
wake up with normal skin
i love putting it in before bed
i put this on twice a week at night after exfoliating
i put this on before i go to sleep
the next day my skin is good
when i wake up in the morning
greasy for the first 20 minutes at least
my skin drinks this up whenever i put it on.
i only put it on at night
in the mornings i use the olehenriksen truth line
i apply it at night to go to sleep
usually next morning my skin will no longer be red
it's also nice to use when i go outside during a windy winter day over my day-time skincare routine
i apply this at the end of my skin care every night
this is my go to after a long hot day on the desert
i picked up the mini pod to travel with me to refresh my skin after a long international flight
i put it on at night
decided to try it one day
firm my skin was the next day
while it is an overnight mask
every morning when waking up my skin is so soft
i used this on my husb
it is an over night mask
can only be layered on at night
even though i wash off when i wake up in the morning
i used this at night
use this every night.
i woke up the next morning with wicked hydrated skin all over
as i am at the moment
your face will feel amazing in the morning if you put this on before bed
i put it on the first night
feels the next morning
my skin still flakes in the mornings from time to time
glows the next morning when i wear it to bed
love this overnight mask!
one use of this overnight mask
the first time i wore this i woke up the next morning
i put this on at night after washing
when i woke up in the morning my face felt moisturized
when i woke up the first morning after using this mask
actually used it every night
i like to use this mask once a week.
i put on at night about an hour before bed
after wearing it overnight
live where winter is snowy
truly see results the next morning
love using this at night also during the day puts a nice glow on your face
rejuvenated in the morning
i us it every 2nd night
i've loved using this as a night time moisturizer a few nights per week
i always leave it over night
i wake up in the morning and my skin feels soft.
after just one night was amazed at how much moisture was in my skin
look forward to putting on at night
i just throw some water on my face in the morning
in the winter i just use this as a night cream
this is the best overnight mask
i try to apply it at least an hour before i go to sleep
i put it on before bed
i've used this every night after another hydration mask
i used it back to back night after night for about a week until my dry skin was completely cleared up
traveling for the holidays did a huge number on my skin
i woke up the next day with not only one
i sleep in it almost every night
/or night on my really dry days
when i use it during the day
i personally use it morning
while you can use this as an overnight mask
i leave it on for 15-20 minutes
i apply it in the morning and at night for bed.
use this mask every night
i love how it makes my face feel the following morning
i break out daily
i used it night
after using it for a while every night i started to see those dark patches
my skin is evening out
only used the creme at night
i am about to run out
i've have sun damage on my face for the last year
definitely a new night staple.
all my makeup is of by the end of the night
after a long day i hop in the shower
i follow up 2-3 times a weekend with the same br
use this at night time
especially when i use it at night
i like using this morning or night under everything else
all of those issues gone in 2 nights!
clear in the mornings
the tone is evening out too
with good skin from staying out of the sun for the last 30 years
i just keep it in the shower
this is my everyday, twice a day face wash!
more on the dry side in the winter
i don't use it at night
on the first wash
so gentle that i only use for morning
is great to put on as you head into the shower in the morning
i only use at night now to avoid the issue.
definitely w/in the 3-5 days advertised on the bottle
i've never slept with it on
usually leave on for 2 hours before rinsing
will update in another month.
used it as an overnight mask
when i woke up the next morning
light at the same time
it's great for using in the morning or following make up removal
could leave it on for an overnight mask which was what i did
woke up the next morning
leave it on for 10 minutes
then wash off or use as an overnight mask
woke up this morning with smooth
plump the next morning
glowing in the morning
sleep with it on
wake up with a shine free face
left it on all night
left it on overnight
after using it the first night
kept it on all night
when i woke up
the first night i used this
i just washed it off this morning
put it on your face like a mask keep it on for half an hour wash off
i sleep with it on nightly
i initially planned to leave it on overnight because my skin is crocodile dry
it felt different" on my skin in a way that i wanted to take it off after an hour
can't wait to see the result tomorrow morning
i used it only as an over night mask
especially in the winter
i would end up peeling throughout the day
i woke up this morning
the next morning i looked so much more refreshed
i used it first overnight
then under makeup after seeing my skin the morning after
tried it for several nights in my forehead
left it on over night
like i usually do in the morning
applied in the evening
was pleased with the results after leaving the mask on overnight
left it on for about 2 hours before rinsing with water
woke up this morning with noticeably clear skin
keep it on overnight
sometimes i go to bed with this on
wash it off in the morning
i will be using it on a 19 hour flight next week
you can leave it on overnight or slather it on for an hour pamper session
i prefer leaving it for an hour
by the time i went to bed
fresh fresh i had the following morning to the trio
must have before sleep.
i would sleep in it
i apply this mask at night
then i sleep in this mask
definitely the best sleep-on mask i've used.
applied this on my t-zone daily
this before primer has kept me matte for up to 8 hours
like i am rested
i added this to my morning
especially with summer approaching
start using it daily
pm before my hyaluronic cream
before make-up or
i apply 3 to 4 drops at night
i used it at night before bed
the next day when i did not use this product i noticed that my face looked a little more puffy than the day before when i had used the serum
that takes only an extra minute of your time
the main point is that you have to follow the massage instroction every day
i usually barely had enough sleep time
this will now be my day serum for winter
after morning showers it's amazing
even at the end of the day
before bed now i use the drunk elephant night serum instead
started using it each morning
pick me up during the day
patting this over my makeup can be a much needed refresh/plumping mid-afternoon or late-night
first time i did this
let it sit for a few minutes then apply my makeup
it stays put all day
when i use it as a nighttime product
it didn't have staying power to last all day
started adding 1 drop of this every morning with my primer
stays in place all day
i leave it for a minute or two
then add a light moisturiser on top for day
smooth like it did in the morning
as well as at night time
this is my go-to after traveling
one day i was in sephora
i prefer using it at night
after wearing this at night!
returned to my daily routine w the balm !!
i always put it on before bed
will update after a month to see if it stays non irritating
especially in the winter
i also use it on my hair a couple of nights a week
i wouldn't use it in summer but for winter.
the sleeping mask next
i only used it in the evening
then started using in under my makeup in the morning of the results
the cream in the morning
i see results in hours
during the day, i apply my make up as usual.
when i went into work this morning
as i wash my face at night
sometimes at night depending on whether i used retin a that evening or not
let the product absorb for about a minute then apply spf 30 for day
i'll keep this in my routine.
am on my fourth
i like to use this in the morning instead of washing my face
i love this for lazy late nights or just wanting to get that make up off :
then i started to use it to cleanse my face in the morning
i usually use this product to cleanse my skin with a cotton pad after waking up in the morning
when i get home after work
i am on my third bottle of this 'water'
i am on my second bottle of this
i regularly use this at night when i'm too lazy to wash my face
i now use it everyday right before my night cream
i decided to try this as my cleansing step in the morning
so now this is a regular part of my post-cleansing routine
/or bedtime make up
i am about 3/4 through my first bottle
i usually use it after my shower
i also use it in the mornings when i wake up when my face isn't shiny enough to warrant a full on face wash
i need to get off the night time grime before putting my face on for the day
with this product i don't have to get out of my bed to do my nightly routine
dirt at the end of the day
it makes it easier in the morning when i'm in more of a rush
most nights i do follow with my regular cleanser
am good to finish the rest of my routine
had to buy it after i started relying on it for quick morning cleansing when i'm running late for work
when i take off my makeup at night
i'll use this as a follow-up after i wash my face
just once a day before sleep
this is my second jar of this overnight mask
use it most nights
size over night- i cant say i use this twice a day as i like it over my lxmi at night for a mask :
then sleep in this baby every night
i think the heaviness of it will make me use it once or twice a week instead of every night
i finally wake up in a cold
not when i use this at night
i wake up in the morning
my face felt luxurious the next morning.
i will never live without this amazing night mask
i wake up with soft baby skin every morning using this product
i got this as a sample during the summer when my skin was dry
with the winter approaching
or will eventually its sitll 60 degrees this late november
foundation was part of my everyday make up routine
gets better every morning.
commented on my skin after the 2nd night of usage
this overnight mask feels wonderful going on at night
supple when i wake up in the morning
the skin looks amazing after using it overnight
this is definitely going to be part of my nightly routine
this is my go to mask twice a week.
i can tell the next day when i wash my face
feel amazed after washing my face in the morning.
i wake up every morning looking fresh faced
in the morning get this mask
i started using this product after my weekly application of the boscia luminizing black mask
the morning-after effect is like i lost 15 pounds overnight
i put it on every night
the next day my face is so
i apply it at night as suggested
in the morning my skin is supply
in the morning i can feel it wash off in the shower
no need for face moisturizer the next day if i used it the night before
i find this product calmed my skin after my nightly regimen
i tried both on last night
your skin feels wonderful the following morning!
inmediately in the morning you can see results
its a must have for your nightly beauty routine.
that goes away after an hour or two as your face absorbs it
smooth the next day
i put this as the last step of my nightly regime.
last night before i went to sleep
at the time i wake up at 4 o clock in the morning
i woke up the next morning with super hydrated
i put a good amount of the cream at night
which i like as i am going to bed
when i wake up in the morning
i sleep on my back throughout the night
when i feel my face in the morning
when i wash my face in the morning
i wake up the second morning with a radiant
the results are worth sleeping on a towel for the night
at first when i told my husb
the first time i used this cream i woke up
i love this overnight mask.
i saw immediate results after the first night of using this rich
depending on how much time i have in the morning
i notice every time i use it in the morning people always comment on how my face
wake up with a refreshed look.
she explained that you can use this every night more as a night cream
my first time to try overnight maskamazing!
wash off in morning or i leave on till i shower which is usually after the gym
used it 2 nights in a row
looked like i had sleep for 20hrs
best night cream i have ever tried!
after using it for just one night i'm in love
i seriously couldn't stop touching my face in the shower this morning
forgot about it until i looked in the mirror next morning
will continue to use as a part of my nightly routine
youthful in the morning when i wake up
tried it out last night
had forgotten i had it on until i went to eat breakfast
it was my first time using an over night cream
on the third day i just use my regular face cream
using it as my nightly treatment
after the two nights i got from that
every time one opens that big jar
each time my skin looked fabulous in the morning.
the second day i did not wear make up which is unusual for me
got to try this product back in feb 2017
i am in my mid 50's
the forehead lines were especially bad after waking up in the morning
i started using this product before bedtime
with just morning use
my face is line fine throughout the day
i am currently in my mid 20s
lasts for about six hours if you spray setting spray on after
stop it before it starts.
i used it nightly after i cleanse
keep me going to my normal april schedule
i check my makeup later in the afternoon
pm around her eyes
i didn't see results on either of us until later on after the first month
how "refreshed" i look at the office all week
i should say that i wash my face morning
tried this product for the first time after watching a video on people magazine's website
i did my normal night time routine: dermalogica toner
i am in my early 40's
time in the sun
i put it on both morning and night.
used half of the dozes than before
use it regularly at night
have to clean that part of the bathroom every time i use it
the day 1 photo just so happens to be the day my cycle started
on the days when my skin is normal
i got a new zit every single morning.
i love using this during my morning shower to help wake me up
use the clearing mud about every other day
you can leave it on for a few minutes
only a week after using it every night i noticed a huge difference
i continued using this daily
shiny free throughout the day
with my clarisonic in the pm
it's fantastic i wash my face with it twice a day
only use it at night
only daily facewash from here on out
this is also perfect to be used before bed.
especially in the winter
i put 6-8 drops every before bed.
it easily washed out the next morning
for the day i use it
4 or 5 drops alone at night
i apply this at night
my skin is clear by morning
making it a pleasure to use every day
then i wake up
as a recent caroline hirons convert i have been using this as my pm second cleanse
i even use it sometimes in the winter mornings
just my nightly/morning face oil
especially for the winter
i put it on right before i get this the shower
ready for the day
when it does work it will shoot the product across the room
gentle enough to use twice a day.
let it sit for a few minutes
for me this is a must have in my nightly routine
i always wet my face in the morning
not in the morning when i am rushing.
usually second cleanse in the evening.)
it's better at night
fresh after i use it
at night because at the end of the day i am an oily mess
using it in conjunction with the overnight
when i used it at night
i put in on every morning
i specially like using it at night because my skin feels really soft soft when i wake up in the morning
since my skin is extra dry during the winter
i love the way it makes my skin feel during the spring/summer/fall
at first i didn't notice it
i mix it with fresh's seaberry face oil at night
that it helps me to wake up in the morning
for i am not a morning person
bright that i never have to rush to put my makeup on in the mornings
i put it on before bed
i usually put it on at night before i go to bed
the night cream in a set
flakey by the end of the day
it works great for both night and morning.
because once i take my makeup off at night
use it during the day
spend a lot of time outside
i only use it at night
cleanse before i go to bed
it doesn't dry out during the day
i am in my early 60s
i put it in my shower
i am in my late 20s
incredibly hydrating for this time of the year where i live
great addition to my morning and evening routine!
even though i'm in my mid-20s
yet continues to hydrate all day/all night
until i tired this
thanks philosophy for helping this 30 year old woman look like she got a 9 hour sleep last night
depending on if its night or day
my nighttime routine is the same up until the eye serum
i would wake up with little
can't go one day without my tatcha routine now!
i can't use during the summer
i probably won't include it in my morning routine because my skin gets oily throughout the day
i massage my face with it for a couple of minutes
i got home from going out last night
i am religious to my purity for taking make up off at night
i just choose to only use this in the morning once per day because i wash my face in the shower
as i would place it on my face
this is the best part of my nighttime skin care routine because i get to watch the day melt off of my face
after massaging it in for a minute
now i use it every morning
i only need to use one pump every night
i am on my second bottle.
when i tried today!
since switching my morning
a bit irritated from trying sunday riley products for a week
tried it this evening
the small travel size lasted forever as i only wash at night
since you start with dry h
every morning i wake up with a super soft
i honestly look forward to taking my makeup off at the end of the night because of this product
i put it on before bed
i wanted to start wearing more during the day
i can't wait to get this in the mail to start using it nightly
especially in the winter
i used this at night
when i woke up
as of now my routine for mornings i wash my face
i hate heavy oils on my face at night.
in the morning after washing
watch my review below for more...
the next morning my face feels so soft
still glowing the next morning when i woke up
one night i was sitting at my vanity getting ready to put this on
every night i look forward to wake up in the morning
i put this on at night after the clinique
give it about 10 minutes before i apply my makeup just
if i fall asleep with make up the next day i'll have a pimple or too
so went to do that next morning
by mid- day i always have a little shine
i started using this oil every night.
when i wake up in the mornings
since adding this to my night time regimen
then two drops after exfoliating in the pm
i do use it both day and night.
not just use as a st
i noticed instant results the morning after use
by using this oil day
i am less shiny by the end of the day
i prefer using by night
during summer i will probably use this only as night moisturizer
when i wake in the morning
i only use the oil as part of my pm routine after washing with the juju bar
i wake up with perfect skin the next day.
if i suspect i'm due for a flare up i slather this on at night
it's my third day in a row using this oil on my dry skin
i also use this on my lips at night
i loveeee using this stuff on nights i'm not using a sleeping mask
i look like i've had hours of sleep!
my skin looks incredible when i wake up in the morning making makeup application a pleasure
how it makes my skin look in the morning
the very next morning
or on its own at night
press it in on my face
i wake up with brighter
i put this on at night after i use my pekee bar
let it dry for 5 minutes
i went on a vacation where i'd be in the sun a lot
putting it in before bed
waking up the next morning with such radiant
as of now my routine is mornings i wash my face
once i tried it the first night
my face looked amazing the morning after
tone improved by the very next morning
i stayed dewy through the night
i didn't see overnight results with the tlc
one night off which did the trick for me
warm it up between my h
it didn't work overnight
i saw results as i continued using it every night
i saw results overnight with this.
i woke up the next day with my face just feeling so soft
i still get oily during the day
fresh skin in the morning
fresh before going to bed
i only need 1 pump at night
first morning after use i could tell a difference
omly use one night before bed
when i woke up in the morning
tried again the next night
continue to get amazing results day after day
i wake up in the morning with my face glowing.
it's noon right now
finally tried it last night
i used it 2 nights in a row with no irritation.
when i start using it again
i started using this once before i went to bed
cut down my usage of this product to every 2-3 days
i just used this product last night
the first night i used it
the next morning when i applied my foundation
with just one night of using this i woke up with radiant skin
has you waking up to clearer skin as the days go on
if i miss a night with this
tried it every other day
use sun screen in the am if you're going to be outside
clear at the same time
since i'm in my late 20's
definitely use it every other night or a couple times per week until your skin is accustomed to the ph
to using it every night
no miracle happens in one night.
i apply this at night after washing my face
during the first week i wasn't sure that i would
the occasion pimple around that time of the month
healthy when i wake up after wearing this
got this in the night bright combo.
i look forward to putting it on every night.
normal/combo in the summer
now i am into my early 30 s
am only on my second bottle
the next morning i woke up with my skin noticeably more glowy
they cleared up in 24 hours
started using the pekee bar tonight
every morning i wake up with brighter skin.
it did burn in the beginning
an absolute ride or die in my routine now!
i am on my second bar of this
i love using this in the morning.
after i use it
it is now a part of my daily routine!
even takes off my makeup when i have occasionally used it at night
i wash with the pekee bar in the morning since my face doesn't get too dirty overnight
i love washing my face at night with this bar.
the juju bar in the mornings
great face wash to use in mornings.
the occasional make-up day
am almost done with my first bar
i only use it at night
in the morning i'm using something very gentle
the juju bar in the mornings
to take it off before bed
even after the first wash --
anti-ageing in my early 20s
the pekee bar before bed
refreshed after using this
now i've started using the juju bar in the morning as my wake my face soap
ps: also try the morning bar soap
refreshed after using this
i used this pekee bar for the first time yesterday
ready for my nightly oil ritual
the juju in the morning
the pekee bar is great to use at night as it calms the skin
i find if i use this bar in the morning
use it at night
then i use peekee in the morning
going to try out their night serum next!
just once in the morning is enough
finishing with pekee in the evening
i work-out twice a day
the peekee bar in the pm
after using tlc the night before
just splash warm water on my face in the morning
in the morning i don't double cleanse
am all about the jlo glow year around
i wrap it after each shower in plastic wrap
i wash with the pekee bar in the morning since my face doesn't get too dirty overnight
i love washing my face in the morning with this bar
i've noticed that on mornings when i don't use this bar
is for evening time
i got both the morning/night facial bars
i notice that by the next morning the area has calmed down
worth every penny to not have to wear any make-up in the mornings
note: i'm using the juju bar in the mornings
the pekee bar at night as they suggest
the eye cream during the night
this bar will last forever
i can use this morning
anti-ageing in my early 20s
the pekee bar before bed
i've faithfully been using it to wash my face every morning
after i wash my make up off with this at night
i've cut back to only using this in the evenings
once i get my routine down i will use this regularly
use the pekee bar in the evening
my face gets oily during the day

i don't see my face getting shiny until later afternoon
i put it on before bed
with some t-zone oil during the day
i only use aqua bomb at night
first thing in the morning
i just got this yesterday
use the farmacy eye cream during the day
by day 2 i was using the belif cream on both eyes
then this weekend i went on a trip
my eye wrinkles were back on monday
within 24 hours of using the eye cream all was good again
on days where i leave a bare face during the day
i can apply it thick at night
i put this on at night
it is the first time that i wake up in the morning
works well with eye make-up for the upcoming hot summer
was on the lookout for an eye cream to use during the day
i wake in the morning without dryness under my eyes
i woke up to a brighter complexion the day after!
definitely a staple in my pm routine.
i apply this at night
and the next morning, the spot lightens up.
healthy to face the day
every morning i notice my face getting brighter
i wake up the next day with my face noticeably brighter
bright when i wake up in the morning
every other mask i tried made my face feel heavy or grubby when i woke up the following morning
i always wake up the next morning with smooth
i wake up the next day with bright
my face looks very fresh the next morning
it is not an overnight fix
super soft the next morning
maybe it's something to use before a shower or at bedtime
the next morning it's gone
where my breakout usually starts
after using this mask that night
the next morning when i woke up i was like "
i must say my face has a nice glow to it in the morning
i put it on after i washed my face at night
healthy when i wake up in the morning
i used it day n night.
it helps with the shine throughout the day
the first morning after using this i saw an immediate difference in the darkness under my eyes
i apply it morning and night.
this morning i skipped it
it is a great cream to use before a night out with friends
in the winter i get dry patches on my whole cheek after putting this cream on in the morning just before my makeup it was gone in two days love love love this i just wish it was less expensive
before city block spf 40 or
great for the summer or very tired, dry days.
i am usually oily a few hours after i put on my makeup this stuff is amazing
next day i'm dry as the desert
perfect for the summer
my face looks so much better every morning after using this product every night
usually struggle with a summer tzone
then once blotting excess oil away in the afternoon
using this at night has absolutely transformed my skin
i used it last night on top of the turnaround night treatment
when i woke up this morning
gave it a try one night with my favorite moisturizer for a week
mostly i use it at night
a half for my face just in the morning
i love to use it alone at night
the next morning my skin would glow
during our dry winter
last week on a whim i mixed this in with my h
after using a 2 drops in my moisturizer every morning for a week
although it's meant to be used as a sleeping mask i use it every day
the bit added at night to my moisturizer has actually helped slow my oil production during the day
most radiant skin when i wake in the morning
i us this morning
night along with my clarisonic at night time
gentle i use this at night
tone of my face is improving day by day
this is a good was to start my daily face routine
two of the mud before bed
again before i shower in the mornings
i noticed a difference the next morning after using this at night
use only 3-5 drops for your face at a time
will never be without it from my daily routine
i usually wear it at night
i only use in the evening.
i tried to wear during the day
i love it during my morning routine
you only need two drops at night to cover your entire face
i am just starting to run out
wore it at night first
i only use this in the evenings but i love it.
i took a 5 hour nap later
still too thick during humid summer days
my face wasn't greasy at all even after a few hours
i don't wear make up so this is the only product on my face during the day
just the right evening out of my skin tone.
this during the day
i wear under my foundation every morning
i wear my makeup for more than 10 hours each day
i still don't look like i've got any makeup left by mid afternoon
i will never use another spf day cream again
now that i'm in my early 30s
i only use in the am
i wanted something with an spf for during the day
it's the best i've tried for prepping my skin for the day
i go tanning once or twice a week
i actually use it on my 7-year-old's face in the mornings
used it every day
it still washed off easily in the evening
i used for the first time this am
even after spending all day at the pool/beach x 3 days
we'll see how it goes for later on in the hot summer season
thought i would give the 40 spf a whirl on a recent trip to aruba
i put this on every morning
this is my new go-to for summer and vacations.
i used it each morning before applying my normal makeup
used a deluxe sample every other day as a part of my night time skin routine- i kid you not- saw a difference in the brightness
did not read the reviews until on this until a few minutes prior to applying to my face
waited about 10 minutes before rinsing it off with warm water
when i woke up in the morning my face was oil-free
let it dry during the rest of my shower routine
cleaned up my skin after a rough weekend of camping
when i woke up the next day
it looked like i got 9 hours of sleep
drank 20 bottles of water every day for a week
the next day i tried it out
wait half an hour before washing it off
this smoothness lasted into the next evening for me which was huge surprise
the first time i put it on
even after waking up
i look forward to using it every week!.
i waited 20 minutes and it still wasn't dry.
it made my face brighter for about 24 hours
but the next morning wow!
about the 4th or 5th time using it
by the time i dry off
even when i get out into the summer heat
just picked this up tonight
sun screen from the weekend
you can use in the shower it only takes a couple of minutes to use it
use them in the morning you will be refreshed
recharged for the day
i put it in the refrigerator before application
i left it on for 10 minutes
these pods are so easy to put half on at night
after my my flight back home to sunny
i left on overnight
then washed as normal in the morning
let it ice our sun-exposed skin for a half hour
it was 115 degrees out today
i left it on about 20 minutes or so
i slept with this on rather than tissuing off before bed
massage it in for about a minute
once i'm in it's a lot warmer than following the instructions
it feels great after a day of trekking around the city
it definitely cleared my face after one use i defiantly recommend this product to be used at least 3xs per week
best for using before bed.
i never put this straight on my face or mix in with my night creams to sleep in
just recently starting using it on a nightly basis
i wake up in the morning with super smooth feeling skin
this is a nice light oil for nighttime
i put it on before bed
the morning after i see immediate results
this oil can also be used in the morning ten minutes before your daytime moisturizer
i wake up with bright skin in the morning
i feel like when i use this at night my skin looks better the next morning
watery for hrs after the first application
i ordered the night cream
my t-zone will soak a plotting paper by 10 am
every morning i would wake up the softest skin after using it
i only used it for 4 night
even through i really loved this oil i plan on buying the night-a-mins cream
i put it on at night after washing my face
put night cream over it
i didn't break out even after using it every night for a week
even acne because when you wakeup the next morning your skin just looks so rejuvenated its worth the money
my skin the next morning was still soft
it literally fixes over nigh or over two nights
i am half way through my bottle
the next morning my skin was smooth.
i really had my qualms about it since i have used the night-a-mins night cream before
i put it on last night
this morning i woke up
after the first night of using it
i ended up selecting this instead of my usual night-a-mins cream
i went to bed last night with irritated skin.
i applied it last night after washing my face
especially at night before going to sleep
this has been great to apply at night
soft when i wake up in the morning
i wake up to fresh baby soft skin every day.
it was one of my first relaxed nights sleep in a long
i saw a difference after 2 nights
it feels so soft when i wake up in the morning.
even the next morning
i wear it at night
in the mornings under my makeup
added this to my night routine
you only need a couple of drops per night
i put it on in the morning after i've
like you just got 10 hours of sleep
use 3/4 times a week in the morning after cleansing
i tried it last night before going to bed on a clean face
invigorating at the same time
will use after a late night out to brighten my face up
relax for 5 or 10 minutes
i usually use after i shower
was glowing last night
i spend whole night
applied this in the morning
it did feel a little tight after about an hour
friday morning while i'm brushing my teeth before i put any morning products on
applied it in the am before my bath
my preferred application is in the morning after staying awake all night studying for exams
i don't want to look like i've had an all-night cram session
looked like i had slept for 12 hours after the first use
when i woke up this morning my face felt amazing
i got to test the product during my 90 minute session in the beauty studio
5 minutes with this mask
it took until the night after that until i felt i "needed" it again
i sleep with this so i use it as a night mask.
sleep with because it's there when i wake up
i wear it at night
in the morning your skin will be glowing!
in the morning my skin is refreshed
i like this product for at night
used it on a 12 hour plane ride
when i wake up in the morning my face is glowing.
am not even going to finish my old night moisturizer
i'd use it at night
i used it in the mornings in the winter time.
when i wake in the morning
it's now part of my regular routine.
apply it in the evening before bed
once in the morning before the day begins
once at night before bed
the other day i went in a pool
t can be used anytime during the day
even for nighttime use
during fall it's a great cream
i used it twice on my face for day and night.
got up at 3:00am on day 2
'pure' when i wash this off
i put it on right after i shower
decided to try it out tonight
started to break out the days i wasn't using it so now i use it every night
the next night i noticed the spot was gone
used it after an entire day of travel.
this mask was on my face for only 8 minutes
in break-out mode for weeks on end
it is a regular fixture in my weekly routine
best use is at night
following up with a heavy night cream or overnight mask
i woke up the next morning with visibly smaller pores
used this mask for the first time last night
after i wash it off
i left it on for 10 minutes
they subsided in the morning
the following morning i noticed my skin was waaaay softer than the night before
a day later the detox part hit me
i tried it that evening
you only leave it on for 10 minutes.
not having to wake up with a new pimple every morning
when i woke up my forehead was way more clear than the night before
i leave it on all night
my skin is not dried out at all after having this thing on my face for hours
i saw results immediately after i used this the first time
because i wear make up every day
nightly as a spot treatment
then go to sleep with it on
i usually leave it on a little longer about 15 minutes
i put on a good amount at night
i started putting this mask overnight fee times a week
i prefer to rinse off before continuing with my nightly routine
i left it on overnight
leave it on overnight
when i wake up
the morning after i use it
winter months i actually wear this mask overnight
really opened during summer usually
i like to leave it on overnight
brighter in the morning
leave it on while i'm sleeping
i usually leave it on for about 30 minutes
my home is extremely dry so my face has felt gross since the first week of january
i usually use it as a night cream
after you remove it in the morning
i plan on keeping it on overnight.
this one is my favoritei tried to leave it on overnight
also love slapping this on after a crazy week of flights
my face is very oily in my tzone one hour after washing
maybe just for the day i use the mask
i used it again last night for the same results.
i used this lastnight for the first time
look forward to that day in the week i get to apply to my face
i will continue to use it twice a week since i am a daily full face make up user
i saw results the first time i used it
feels the next morning after i use the product
left it on my face for about 15 minutes
let it dry for 10 minutes
it works great for overnight spot treatment too!
up to 30 mins to an hour on
i leave the mask on for hours at a time
i got this yesterday.
when i woke up this morning my skin was luminous
usually when i get up in the morning my skin is dry
in the winter its just awful
i just wear it to bed at night
adding this product was truly the last step i needed to finish off my nightly routine
it would spring back to life
i put it on last night without moisturizer to see how it acted alone
i woke up this morning not oily at all
i put some on again for my day face
i am on my second bottle of this oil as i use it every morning
on makeup free days i'll use this as my daytime oil
use the rest of the sunday riley line
i woke up the next morning with my skin looking more alive somehow
i applied it at night after my regular cleansing routine
i applied it the next night
woke up to even better results the next day
i am going to incorporate this into my routine.
looks younger the next morning
stays on all night long even when i wake up its still there
i applied this after a hot day in july
is perfect for night or under makeup in the day
leave it on all night
it's my go to plan of attack for dry summer skin.
then i use this as a sleeping pack
after my daily routine
this smoothes it out so well after the night or throughout the day
this masks works best when left on over night :)
both when i woke up in the morning
like 4 or 5 hours after my morning skincare
tight later on in the day?
i usually leave on for 15 minutes before washing off
i would have to stop my meds for a couple of days at a time
overnight my skin was 100% better
now i use it every night as my regular nighttime moisturizer
i apply it to my clean face before bed a few times a week
just sleep in it
i put a layer of this on every night before bed
sleep with it on
used it three nights as a leave on treatment
i apply it last and then go to bed.
i find myself opening the jar even on nights i don't use it
every morning that i wake up after using this
i used the mask at night
my skin looked amazing in the morning
my face can look old in the morning.
will be a staple in my routine from now on!!

i love having this product in my night rotation
i wake up in the morning with beautiful skin
smooth when i wake up
i leave it on overnight as a sleeping mask
i apply a thin layer to my face at night a few times a week
i really only need it during the winter time
after a long beach vacation my skin was so dry
i don't use this year-round
clear the next day
warm it up in my h
not as red as it tends to be when i wake up in the morning
using it is a pleasure each night.
i take my showers at night
the best find this summer.
want an easy removal routine at night
wash my face a 2nd time with micelular water
feels like a spa visit at the end of the day
i love using this in the evening
i've noticed i spend an extra couple minutes at the end of the night now as i never knew how relaxing washing your face could be
use it in the morning when i don’t have any makeup on
i will continue to use it as part of my morning routine
at the end of the day
it is great at taking off makeup at the end of the day
in the morning i can put my makeup on
half an hour later when i get to work my nose is shiny
the oil starts to pool on my t-zone
by the end of the work day
i typically have to blot every 45 minutes
is gone in like half a workday
will look a tad masky for about an hour
i am in my mid 40's
at first i just noticed my face looked more awake
which makes this product an amazing addition to my routine in the morning
i put it on every morning after showering
leave it on my face for 5-10 minutes then rinse off
continue with my routine
depending on the week or season
refreshed after using this
this was a better daily wash
it was a great daily wash!)
i leave on for about 15 minutes
got really dry after the second day
so now i only use this daily on my t-zone
he also says he definitely notices a difference in his skin when he showers at my place
i will use it once in a while on my t-zone if my skin is having a rough week
only every other night
at first i was using it daily
i also leave the cap off for about 1/2 hour to an hour after using it
when i use this daily
when i get some on my h
i typically only wear heavy makeup fri-sun so at most i use this three times a week
after using this in the morning my skin is so clean
went home used it that night
use this in the am
because i got busy i stopped using it for a week
that could be due to i used nair the day before
worth the minute it takes
this is perfect for day and night!
i am on my second bottle.
when all the following failed:
i forgot to put this on twice last week.
tried it this morning after cleansing
last night i used this instead of the sunday riley oil
i woke up this morning with such soft
i put a little on before i go to sleep every night
applied it at night
in the morning i had plump
especially when i stay up late
looks tired when i sleep to late or not sleep
my skin was a disco ball by hour two
i just use this now at night before bed
either from nighttime wear
it will plump you skin for a good 12 hours after washing it off in the morning
i put it on at night
however after using this oil with my regular evening skincare routine
a few more drops as a night treatment mixed in with a night time moisturizer
like to use 2-3 drops of oil on my face almost every night
i am turning 49 next week
i apply it every morning before heading out to the office
i am already on my second bottle
then leave it on for 15-20 minutes
today was my first using it
hours later while looking in the mirror i saw that my dark marks were about 50% lighter after just this one use
after an evening shower
i recommend using this the day before a big event
every morning i wake up
the first time i used it was an evening i ended up meeting some girlfriends for main/pedis
i started sleeping with this mask on
i get an amazing glow in the morning
used it 3 nights in a row
might have helped a little evening out the tone
after one use my skin was radiant after the three day booster my skin was so even
leave it on after for 10-15 minutes
at the end of the day
i used this mask nightly every day for a week
by morning it is a full wow moment
it is now night 3
i made sure to get this on tonight
saw results in clarityby the 3rd use
i both use them on our faces before moisturizer in the evenings
your good to go for the rest of the day
asked me the other day if i had had something with mustard on it for lunch
i am half-way through my first pack
am placing my next order now
when i am too tired to do my full nightly face regime
used it the morning of a hangover
i woke up to new skin.
the only downside is that the effects start fading after 48 hrs
use it every day
used it this morning before speaking at a national conference
i live in a humid area
am adding to my morning routine two days a week
the next day i'm not as oily
clean the rest of the day
wake up the next day with smoother skin
the trick is to use it before the shower
after i use it
i also noticed the next day that my makeup went on smoother
i leave it on for 20 minutes
i normally wear a light coverage foundation every day
tried it that night
when i am starting to break out
i used it before bed
followed it with a thick night cream
when i woke in the morning
i just got it today
i noticed right away the difference when i woke up the following morning
especially in the winter
this morning was my first time using the mask
the burning lasts for a minute before subsiding
the instructions say to leave it on for 10 minutes
perfect for winter time.
i applied this at night
in the morning they were all gone
on sunday nights before bed
use one at least every single day
occasionally in the mornings
then 2 hrs later i get super oily
every morning, i would see a new breakout.
stays on all day
as long as i put this on at least 5 minutes before climbing into bed it dried enough
when i get home
after showering in the mornings i put the pink
recently i was out of night cream
plump the next morning
my skin looked great the next morning
glowing the next morning
a little dry the next morning
i usually purchase the rose sleeping mask
i wait about 3 minutes after i put it on
my face was almost flawless the next morning
in the morning my face was clear
when i woke up in the morning i was shocked of how soft it left my skin
was not sticky and i slept in it just fine.
i love using this mask at night
tried it last night
sometimes during the day
this morning i woke up with glowing skin
i put it on before i go to bed
by the second night of using them my skin was back to normal
when i apply this mask at night
i used a third of the lotus mask last night
but hard to sleep in.
pomegranate make me look like i got my 8 hours of sleep
i used it last night
waking up to see the difference from over night
i put it on overnight
due to my approaching time of month sigh
i get the "glow" after each use
use them every night.
i put a layer of it all over my face at night
i like the way my face feels the next morning when i wash it off
i swear by the overnight masks.
i used this mask the night before my birthday this year
when i woke up
the entire week after it was much calmer
if you use a moisturizer first then this pod will last you 4-7 nights depending on how much you use
part of my weekly routine.
just on the first night i saw results
this is in my routine from now on!
i went to exchange a product at sephora today
i look so refreshed when i wake up
one packet lasts me about 4 nights
i will apply the rose mask overnight
after about 4 days i noticed a difference in my skin when i woke up
when i wake up
i used it during the travel
added it into my nightly routine
now do this sleeping mask once a week
on the weekends i'm makeup free
when i would wake up in the morning
when i put this on before bed
around noon time it looked like i was ready to fry a fish on my face
by 5pm i started to get a little oily which is usually the time i head home from work
after a long day of work my face was not oily.
i stay shine free even after a 8-9 hour work day
i know longer have an oil slick t-zone by lunchtime
i am oily within seconds
i usually apply this before benefits' s porefessional
then i use smashbox 15 hour makeup
after a couple hours i am a mess
i put it on in the morning
i also apply it at night for better results
i'll wake up the next day with horrible raccoon eyes
of course i go in with a face wash afterwards
my make up would be melting off after a few hours
a had little chat one day with an employee at sephora
this is my favorite way to clean my face every night
especially in this cold season
have used about a fifth of it using it every night
i follow this up with a regular face wash
sometime i will use it to take off my makeup
i put this on at night
when i wake up in the morning it feels like i just put moisturizer on
i follow with origins ginzing eye cream in the morning
just tried it last night
i can wear it all night
soothing until the last second before rinsing off
i this morning i applied it for the 4th time this week
the effect lasts throughout the day
when i go on vacation
used them every day during my vacation
night my skin was normal
then massage it into skin every night
i add a little ddml cream only at night.
after the first night alone
after the second night they feel so much more plump
i literally looked in the morning this morning
stays on all day.
i've finally found the perfect every day face cream
day cream on the go
very generously in the evening before bed
especially in the winter
during the day under my make-up
i also use it in the morning before my primer before makeup
especially in winter or post-shower
will be using this as a night cream
it stays on for a long time
by morning its all absorbed
picked this one up for winter to use at night.
won't start my day without it especially on a makeup-free day
i definitely don't use this during the day
i wait a couple minutes before putting on any makeup
found this one when i was at sephora
would be great in the day for super dry days as well
which happens year round
that goes away by the next morning
i used the tria eye wrinkle correcting laser two nights in a row so this is a preliminary review that i will add to over time
stayed that way all the next day
skipped them the second night to allow healing
the full minute on each side is just too much
i reduced the time the second night
i will increase the amount of time each night
will check back in a week or so
i returned to sephora the next day
i just finished my first 8 week session
after i use korres night cream
at this point i can only use it 2 nights in a row before the skin is red
le this is three nights straight
then two nights off
every night at first
down time to wake up to better looking eyes the next day
you're supposed to use it at night.
nothing heavy to wear at night
if it is still red the next day
with my foundation in the morning
these drops have allowed me to add to my night time routine
when i wake up the next morning my skin is always soft
i now also use it at night after washing my face
wake up in the morning with a great

since receiving it i used it every day after my shower at night
during the day if needed
a heavy night cream before bed to balance things out
even in the winter
i wear it alone on lazy days or under foundation.
soft at the same time
as long as i give it a minute or
go to school full time
i put in on in the morning
gross by the end of the day
after results on skin
i really needed the 30spf as i live in a very sunny climate in the summer
i am also using the ultimate day and night cream.
i put this on one night
only thing is when i use it at night over my treatments
i only use it during the day since i use retinol at night
my skin feels so good after applying this in the morning
just a little bit is needed morning

even better in the morning
sometimes when i wake up after a night with night creme on my skin is super shiny
it just feels so amazing when i wake up in the morning
it's a night time product
i've searched for the perfect daytime eye cream for years
i wear this during the day and it is amazing.
i only use it in the mornings
it's said to be a morning eye cream
i saw results when i first it on.
put it on at night before bed without it feeling gross

lasts throughout the day
in the morning i use it under my sun protector
especially for night use

it works well as a day cream in the winter too
i almost cried the morning after the first night i put it on
i pair with the eye cream and use at night.
i am still on the same container
the only item i changed in my regemine was adding this product to my night time routine
by the next morning
i work up looking refreshed after only a few hours sleep
i am in my mid 20s
this one suffices for night time also
i got this in a kit at the airport waiting for a flight
i wake up in the morning and look refreshed.
my complextion tone is evening out
will never use another night cream again.
i love putting this cream on at the end of the day
n the mornings during a particularly dry period
even in the middle of winter
one minute it's rainy
the next it's sunny
initially, i wanted to use it as a night cream.
after two nights of use my skin felt softer
great for day in winter or summer nights
isn't enough for winter nights
in my time in switzerl
always light through the day
smooth in the morning
unless you have time in the morning to wait for the mask to dry
or use it at night
then going about my morning routine
i used this for the first time this past sunday after a weekend of excess: too much sun
i went to sleep after
the next morning my skin was glowing
only leave it on for 3 minutes
2 times per week in conjunction with my regular cleanser
the white in the mornings
get in the shower or wash off about 5-10 minutes later
which i let sit for 3 minutes
then run around the house for a good 15/20 minutes getting my coffee
this is the only way i start my day.
i put this on my face while preparing my bath
i workout 4-5 days a week
you keep it on for 3 minutes then when washing it off
you leave it on for 5 to 10 minutes
depending on the season
i began using it after my monthly hormonal break out
a wanted a mask that i could use a couple times a week in addition to my regular nightly face wash
i applied prior to my shower
even into the morning
use it at night
so when i had some friends meeting up for a week of fun
i love putting them on before hopping in the shower
this is great when you don't have time for a full pampering session
then after you leave it on for 3 minutes
dry in the morning
once in the morning
i tried this for the 1st time
i apply it at night first
i also apply in the morning
if you use it the morning
even in summer temperatures
until i used this!!!!
i only put it at night time.
i used it as a day cream on its own
i am trying another product this time around
can tell the effects immediately the next morning
i live in very humid place
i used it at night
i usually use this at night
wake up with refreshed
use it both morning
after about a month of using this serum every night before bed
continued using it every night bc the results are incredible
even after sleeping in my make up
after a few night only use added to my usual routine
even after a shower you still notice the results
i actually think i'm less shiny when i wake up in the morning
i also use the product at night on my entire face
then layer on an evening algenist cream
sometime i forget the cream
night after washing my face
perricone 800 line says once a day preferably in am
am glad i've added this extra step to my morning routine
i only use them once a day in the morning.
i plan my morning routine around it
later in the day it's fantastic
not as a night cream
i used it before bedtime
don't forget each morning when i drink my orange juice
until i found this product
that afternoon i happened to stop by sephora
within a week of using this every night before sleep
until i found this product
in just one night
my skin is night
i used this product before bed
i used it again in the morning
then again the following night just as directed
i decided to try it in the mornings
since i am out
about in the daytime
it's now a staple morning and night.
night after i wash my face with the juju bar
during my weaning-off stage
not just for only the night
when i wake up
if sephora runs another special
was able to snatch it when it was $12 for black friday
i put it morning and night.
in the morning it lasts throughout the day.
i put this on under my night cream just on my nose
so now i use this as part of my morning routine
i am early 30s
only use it in the evening
i made this my nightly routine
this has become a part of my nightly routine
i wake up every morning with dewy skin
i used this during the day
i wake up every morning with dewy
i only use it at night
now i use it every morning before my regular moisturizing routine
where do i begin!
feel awake every morning
or when i need a little lift during the day
i mostly use it at night because it sits on my skin
i am on my second bottle
the retexturizing treatment at night
this has become part of my night-time routine
i only have to blot once in the afternoon
that works well for skin it's late-20s/early-30s
i actually look forward to putting this on my face every morning
dry at the same time
at night before bed after washing my face
the best part was waking up to non-dewy/greasy feeling skin the next morning
after using it on my own the next day
when it's a work day or i need my base to last all day
i went back the next day
i knew after one morning that i had to have it.
last treatment before bed
gave it a try last night
this morning when i woke up
t-zone oil in the summer
as well as the daytime one
the day time version of it
since my cleanser is on my skin for such a brief time before i wash it off
not the night version
the nighttime cleanser since it came together
it adequately preps my skin for the rest of my morning routine
which is nice to wake up to
and using this at night.
i started using this cleanser along with the night time one
a great for the morning use
i highly recommend this and the night time one.
i wake up in the morning with my skin feeling plump
after 10 minutes i washed it off
i leave it on overnight
i did it prior to bed
i see the biggest difference in my dry skin when i use this one: i also have the holiday mini masks that came out last year
it does brighten my skin for a few minutes after application
it says wear for 10 minutes
i left it on for at least an hour or more while laying around the house
i can use it in the morning after my show
prior to my tinted mosterizer or at night before my night time beauty creams
i tried this mask the first time today.
also love that it only stays on for 3 minutes
while this is advertised as nighttime
also at night right before i go to bed
get oily during the day in some areas
it packs a little to much punch for my morning make-up routine
i am using it in conjunction with the night balm
am getting very little sleep
the only product i'm not in love with is the night time "balm"
tried that night before going to bed
i found the next morning that i got even skin tone
then i tried the night balm which is nice
it's just the right magical cream to refresh mid day or early morning
t says for morning
i actually put it on at night or after a shower chilling at home
so before bed is great.
i apply this every day
night for a week now
i put this on after i wash my face every morning
when you sleep with it
i put it on after my shower
especially in the winter
perfect for the summer
/or after i get out of the shower
i've never used a product that was as effective at evening out my complexion as well as brightening it
every morning i wake up with super smooth skin!
she recommended it for throughout the day touch ups
make the bb cream stay all day
keeps my make-up in place all day
a new "must" for my morning routine!
do the same thing for my nighttime routine
especially during the winter
before my makeup in the mornings
i've never used daily oil before
ts going to last a long time
putting 1-2 in my foundation for my morning routine
i've reduced my nightly amount
i still use 1-2 drops with my foundation in the mornings
night not to heavy at all
i keep it in my shower
since he began washing at night with this bar
i used it both this morning
this evening when i got home
i swear by this product in the morning.
so happy to have this product just in time for the cold weather season
i do get one pimple the week before my period
it's smaller the next morning
i only use at night though
kiehls midnight recover eye cream
i no longer wake up with a new blemish every morning
night after washing my face
i applied this overnight
it is probably the best oil i've used during my morning routine
my makeup is usually a hot mess before lunch
the shine doesn't show for several hours after using this
s down recommend this oil over any of sunday riley's because 1
only lasts for 5ish minutes before it completely disappears
i used it the first night
the next morning my skin looked almost clear
tip: i use the 10 drops at night
then i only use about 5-6 drops in the mornings
i would still wake up with a couple every day
wearing it under my foundation on the days i don't see much sun
i am on week two with this
i'll be reviewing luna oil at a later date.
azulene used to be a spa secret back in the day.
i only use this at night
i only use it at night
it has made its way to my regular skin care day routine
it is only my 5th day using this product
after about 15 minutes of it soaking in
then in the morning when i wake up
however, i am the complete opposite.
also at night sometimes before bed
hang around for months at a time
it's still not finished even after i've used it twice a day every day
i'll always have to blot mid-day
i've used this oil alone the last few mornings
i would have to blot my face at least 4-5 times a day
perfect for the winter time
i put this on at night
i wake up the next day glowy
i actually woke up with a glow the morning after i used it
all were just too heavy for day.
when i use this oil at night
i can look forward to waking up in the morning
youll wake up with glowing skin every time
a true staple to my nightly routine!
each morning after using this oil
i pick at my skin all the time
only in the mornings
its too heavy for daytime for me
just use this at night
or under night cream
i also use cream over top of this oil at night
i wear this oil overnight
i also use a bit as a part of my morning routine before my makeup
i used this at night only
i apply it at nighttime to my face and neck.
i originally used this oil at night
don't sleep on this
i especially love after i shower at night
whenever i apply this to my face at night
it's light enough to apply in the morning under your make up
can't wait to see my face after a month!
i started to notice a difference by the 3rd day.
then on the 4th night
after only using the blue tansy in the morning for 5 minutes on a rushed day
when i woke up in the morning it looked like i had different skin
in 10 minutes i can see
i like to put it on a few minutes before i get in the shower
i usually use this product for eventful nights or days when i just want to have especially glowy skin
i am getting ready to purchase my second jar.
it’s a great pick me up for your face when you’ve had a long day/week
get it one day
i do this every week.
that i notice on me at least
using it every other night
never had any breakouts until my late 20s
i would use it 2 nights in a row each week.
after just one use of this i woke up the next day
my skin was clear in just after a week of usage.
i love to use this when i feel a breakout coming on or during that time of the month
in the beginning i followed its instructions
i used this mask everyday for the first 3 days per the instructions
it takes about a week to show results
i've used this 3 nights in a row
used this as an overnight mask
i often leave it on while i have breakfast in the morning to save time
now in my mid-20s
then follow up with 2-3x a week
i used it the night i got it.
i look forward to using this mask every night
i leave it on the maximum 25 minutes
so far i'm on my 4th day.
i used this mask for three nights straight
i would put this on a zit before bed
leave it on overnight
im on week two
i've used this mask multiple nights in a row
the directions say to use it every day for the first week
i used it for 4 nights
super hard to rinse off after leaving on for 20ish minutes
my dermatologist suggested putting it on once a week before the start of a shower
my follow-up routine
i tried this mask last night for 20 minutes.
when i did my makeup later in the day i actually was like wow
after my usual morning routine of serum
i've tried using it every day
let sit for 20 minutes
i leave it on for a while
leave it on for 20 minutes
i went in for my monthly facial
with periods of my usual oilyness
have been wearing night
or when i get home from a long day out
when i woke up
during the day i use keihl's eye alert which is another awesome dark circle product
i pat a bit under each eye every morning before makeup
every night after i wash my face
if i put it on at night i wake up with lighter dark circles
i put this on night and day in my eye area.
probably even yesterday so two days when i put ths cream on
i used it primarily in the morning
sometimes at night for about a month
sometimes i apply this during the day
this goes in great in the morning
i pat it around my eyes, day and night.
2 minutes later be able to put on my concealer without any issue
look more refreshed after using it in the morning
wake up looking like i've slept for 8 hours :)
i put on a very small bit on morning and night.
as soon as i get out of the shower at night
night for almost a month i am seeing results
i try to use right after my shower or immediately after i wash my face
its my go to at night for a long time to come
i used this once in the morning
i woke up this morning
so light weight is great for day and night.
i do use this every night
2 nights ago i tried this serum with the sleep tight
immediately the next morning my skin felt amazing
what a way to start the day
i am now on my second bottle of this product
seems to last through my 12 1/2 hour shifts of work
after just one day of using it in the morning
then i apply it much lighter in the mornings
as of now my routine for mornings i wash my face
this skin i only use during the day
also once i started to use the framboos night serum that took care of my dry patches
all comment on it on the days i use this
fresh-- it's 8 hours of sleep in a bottle
at first i only used c firm in day time
i would apply it in the morning before going to work
i are a little over a week into our new skin care day/night routines
i get a super oily t-zone during the day
i love this after i wash my face in the morning from my face to my neck
with one pump a day
glowing the next day
it makes my skin wake up in the morning
i don't really wear make up unless on a day to day basis
i am out for the day
i live in relatively mild climate with an average of 72ish days of full sunshine a year
s all day long
i wear this almost every day because i live in florida where the exposure to sun is almost constant

especially in the winter
in the morning i've taken note how soft my face feels
use this with my clarisonic after
if you notice when you bought it at sephora it was on the hot now station
i look forward to washing my face at night
used it before a night out
let it sit on your skin for 10 minutes
then the next morning it was so smooth and soft.
no sitting for 20 minutes with a mask on
i love to sleep with it on over night because it does sink into the skin after 30 minutes
definitely not on my daily/weekly list
i also noticed that the day after i used this mask
they have been keeping me up late at night
i saw immediate results the next morning
we both saw results the next day after she applied it the night before
i don't apply it in the morning
i like to use this cream in the morning

it was just too heavy for daily use
i usually leave it on for at least 5 minutes then simply scrub it off
leave that on your face for a minute before rinsing off
if my skin looks this good every morning after using then it's worth it
leave it on for about 20 minutes as an extra hydrating mask as well
i've switched it into my morning routine because i find the scent
bringing it into my morning routine had resolved this
in the mornings, my face needs a dose of this.

refreshed when i wake up in the morning
being in the sun all summer

i felt like i was glowing the whole next day.
the next day woke up with very smooth skin
stays on all night
i apply it at bedtime after i've cleansed my face
my first time using a night time mask
i applied it after cleaning my face before bed.
the next morning it looked like i went to the spa
very tempted to use during the day time due to light weight

i immediately noticed a difference the next morning
every time i open the jar
i love that i wake up to a fresh
