the price for this moisturizer is steep
def overpriced for the stickiness it leaves your face with
there are a lot of other creams out there that also soothe my skin without the price tag
oil free deep moisture
it would not absorb
it doesn't absorb into the skin .
this cream did not absorb into my skin at all
it is fine for the nighttime
however, it does soothe my skin a lot.
it just sits there, thick and will not absorb.
on the upside things tend to burn my skin
absorbs quickly without the greasy feel.
that it quickly absorbs
less for the function
a top ingredient is alcohol
the price is steep
because sonic is on it
it applies so unevenly
skin by skipping this product
you have to apply a thick layer to make peeling easier
combination skin this summer
it has a neutral smell
this takes forever to absorb
very soothing, but took forever to absorb.
the applicator tip is tedious
i didn't find any impact on the elasticity or suppleness or find that my skin did any faster healing while using this product
it has a gel-like consistency
once i discontinued the serum automatically my skin did a 180
much prefer this than an eye droplet.
i stopped using relatively quickly
i am a loyalist to fresh products
to have a "corset like effect
find that it absorbs quickly even though i have relatively oily skin
my skin look so dulls
therefore exaggerates my dark circles
it does absorb very nicely though
they all about the eyes rich is good for treating early aging skin
does not blend well
takes a while to be absorbed
it's an average eye cream.
i like this thin consistency that works well under concealer
as opposed to thicker ones
it's a poor manufacturing/design feature
it absorbs quickly, but it's not brightening.
it squirts extra product
the plastic cap cracked rather quickly.
you might wni regularly use clinique eye cream
i normally use the bio performance advanced super revitalizing cream
produce oil throughout the day
i normally use 1-2 blotting paper
when i use this i have to use 4-5 blotting paper throughout the day
this is a pore-clogger
want to avoid any more sun damage
for it's anti-aging value
go back to my winter product murad hydro-dynamic™ ultimate moisture
the benefits are undone by all the exfoliating necessary to keep your skin clear while using it
i felt the cooling properties
continue my search for other methods for reducing undereye wrinkles
have used their anti aging line on
while it fills in fine lines
also, it dries too quickly to apply it smoothly.
try their pores no more primer instead
save the $ and get real injections.
i adore the needles no more product which greatly reduces any fine lines
based upon my skin
it says apply on clean skin
no hydration and no tightening or lifting.
this product has absolutely no anti aging properties in it- it basically is a topical product that sort of blurs lines
depending on your makeup
the other issue is the flaking that occurs shortly after application
i really like the repair wear laser focus
don't increase oils in the day time
its function as well as the simplicity
different with the foam
this is a great product for superficial
temporary plumping of the skin
the retinol content is so low that you may as well toss this for kate's micropeel cream which is 100 percent retinol based with no gimmicks
it doesn't foam effectively each time
then switch to a different retinol product with a different application system
have used a variety of clay/charcoal clarifying masks
did not actually remove/extract impurities
at best it made it easier to do manual pore extractions
this is a standard foaming face wash.
i found mainly reviews for the mud mask
i'll stick to the anti aging gel for now.
it was like it stripped my skin from its natural moisture
the mask is life changing.
love the rose stem cell products
no better than other hyaluronic acids i've used at much cheaper prices
the roller ball is difficult to get product out of
be proactive about my anti-aging
storing it upside-down helps
applicator leaves a lot to be desired
its not greasy and it absorbs quickly.
(i use the oils as well.)
i layered my argon oil on top
mix that with this product to get the level of moisture i like
absorbs quickly into clean skin
will stick with josie's original argan oil.
being a fan of the original argan oil
the grains are far too large to actually exfoliate
the raw sugar crystals in my free sample were really sharp
it dissolves which is nice
does seem to balance moisture levels
it fills with water
plus it didn't remove the makeup as good as the essential c cleanser by murad
helps to clean out my pore
still i'll keep using it to satisfy my inner self
the one main ingredient is corn starch?
then about 2 minutes later my olfactory system was overwhelmed by the noxious perfume overload
i wanted my pores to shrink
my skin is fairly clear aside from my enlarged pores
fix the smell and lower the price!
"minimize pores, blur imperfection".
and the packaging has a massive flaw.
this is stickier than good genes is
stop changing winning formulas.
anti aging or firming
it also didn't brighten or soften or reduce fine lines
if used everyday it caused irritation.
the breakouts stopped as well
it goes on flawlessly
loved the former bare minerals skin care line with active soil complex
radiant as it used to be since they stopped adding their active soil complexn in the skin care products
instead it is a salve that is inadequate to other products
as a supplement to my nighttime regime
rolling directly to my face results in uneven application
it took longer to absorb than the jojoba
i've spent money on high quality carrier oils
including the essential oils
while it did soak in quickly
the price is steep
this product consists of chemicals
i would suspect the silicone interfered with absorption
the stick goes fast.
it is pure oil
it doesn't spread well
i like the cooling sensation
the cooling part is true
the stick is wide and clunky.
i've used much better cooling/de-puffing eye gels
it does have a cooling effect
it does have a cooling effect
it outweighs the cooling
this stick has a real cooling effect
makes makeup apply unevenly on top
the wide tube is also kind of clunky
it glides on well
this is so unnecessary
does give a cooling effect
as it is a cooling water
distinct smell once it is applied
after awhile the smell dissipates
it fades very quickly
that creates a physical barrier on your skin
after using it for a week my normally clear skin was completely congested with clogged pores
although it absorbs fairly quickly
it only contained spf 20
it also has a strong scent.
i used this alongside the clarifying cleanser.
it feels like a heavy cream
it didn't seem that effective in helping prevent acne or lessen it
it is a good lightweight moisturizer that absorbs quickly
my acne is mild to moderate depending on my stress levels
absorbs quickly into the skin
i preferred to use a night cream with heavier hitting ingredients at night
just average regular moisturizer!
the spray is very direct
even with different types of masks
claiming it helps with masking benefits
this helps applying any clay mask much easier
it did nothing to optimize the masks.
it essentially acts as a toner
used a favourite non-origins mask of mine
it didn't even spray on evenly.
the maskimizer is marketed as a pre-mask primer.
i don’t doubt that using this product immediately before applying your mask will help to make it easier to spread your mask on evenly
it may make it easier to rinse off
as for making it easier to rinse your mask off
moisture loosen the mask
use a mist or essence first before masking
then might as well use a toner at that point
it does soften your skin
help spread your mask
it's not an essential step in your masking routine
additionally, the packaging is a nightmare.
i tried this mask primer with 2 different masks
its cleansing ability was poor
as someone that suffers from periodic dry patches
this is your run of the mill cleanser.
the double cleansing method
while it removed makeup well
it has reduced the frequency of breakouts
when i used their skin care line with activesoil complex
e brings back their previous skin care line with the activesoil complex
it made breakouts flare up
still searching for the elusive holy grail that does it all
it did not absorb well at all
doesn't absorb into the skin quickly
my skin gets easily congested
since this was the only variable i added to my routine
i often experiment with skin oils
t is absorbed fairly quickly
the more i used it the more i could smell the rancidity
it was cheap plastic
the lids wouldn't close properly
the dual jar packaging system is terrible
well it comes in 2 steps
it doesn't blend it well
does not absorb well
the "radiance" part translates into a slick-looking face after a few hours
it was light weight which i enjoy
dries quickly- calming to the skin
preventing whatever helpful ingredients actually are in this product from being properly absorbed into the skin
hence my low rating
it helps the foundation apply smoothly
like a boost or a quick feeling of hydration
unfortunately i was continuously trying to compensate for the lack of moisture
this ingredient is known to create a barrier over the skin which doesn't allow your skin to breathe as well as if any bacteria gets trapped underneath the moisturizer
it also stretches your skin
i've used a fancl cleansing oil before
much of the product was wasted while typing to dispense
the cleansing oil was disappointing
i always double cleanse
it removes my makeup
it has a "cooling" sensation much like the boscia makeup breakup oil cleanser
it dispenses the perfect amount
such as shrinking pore size
i love that the product is dispensed by a dropper
i didn't suffer from large pores to begin with
smoothness i receive from the product
different amounts to in hopes to find the perfect blend for my skin
my pores did become smaller
didnt help any of the wrinkles or the deep circles
went to tap in the excess moisture--
doesn't interfere with makeup
works well as far as applying concealer over it
as soon as it absorbs
it contains peptides which helps to reduce the appearance of dark circles
fast-absorbing as i hoped
in addition, it is not cooling.
the cream almost absorbs too fast.
focuses less on the anti-aging
the major drawback - beware - it pills up.
the fact that comes in a pump like container
long lasting hydration for the under eyes this is not it
make sure you allow plenty of time for the product to absorb into your skin before applying makeup
not oily/tight/or resulting in breakouts
i've used shiseido's micro targeting spot corrector night
didn't absorb at all
as in didn't absorb well
i prefer my plant based enzyme products they work better on evening out skin tone
it also sank in my skin fairly quickly.
the only cream that has effectively moisturized
you can see every single granulate
the packaging of the "beam" in the cap of the "hydrate"
this product works better on normal-oily skin types
really like the liquid component of this product
it was light weight
base for my foundation
the cream highlight in the cap is
not heavy on the skin
to appeal to a more diverse audience
my skin is more medium toned
it mixes well with my foundation
i could see using it more for contouring actually
i especially like the colloidal gold mask so my expectations were high for this product
make it adjust w my skin
i think an ingredient might be pore clogging/comedogenic
it really enhances your blemishes
does not absorb well
it does not absorb well
doesn't absorb very well
it does take a long time to absorb
soy face wash then i find it works way better
i think the rose fragrance was an irritant for me as well
when i mix with any other products it starts to peel off
it didn't absorb into my skin
this product feels and behaves like a primer.
stickiness went through the roof
dries out to be this tight layer of solidified product on your face
it absorbs very quickly which is a plus.
need a layer of cream on top.
spread this very quickly after application
it also feels a bit sticky for a while after application
after i've applied a face oil
it also claims to tone
it absorbs so fast
layers well under makeup.
the only thing i like about this product is that it reduces the size of my pores
the pump is separated
my skin type is combination
appreciate the air-tight pump
my skin type is combination
its not providing the moisture i need
absorbs quickly is spot-on
there irritants should be eliminated.
i normal use fab
had to wash it off due the strong cheap perfume scent similar to bug spray
wide for a new moisturizer to love
smoother after the use
t keeps germs out of the unused product
i love their new re texturizing mask as well as the overnight mask
messy to apply because the product gets released so quickly
the consistency of this product is akin to raw egg whites
was not miscible with a simply face oil
that blends into your skin
yes, it absorbs quickly.
the way it dispenses with a bit of waste
love korres products overall as skin care
the second ingredient is alcohol denature this dries out skin
it felt like an unnecessary step
in order to use had to add to another serum just to get it to spread
the stickiness goes away after about 5 minutes
it does absorb well
my main issue with this serum is the scent- way too strong
it also clogged pores on the lower half of my face
my skin absorbs it in seconds
i mix 4 drops with my face oil
it does absorb very nicely though.
soaks in almost too fast
it removed makeup well
this packaging keeps me from using the product everyday
it is also glass
i always have to lean it downwards towards the sink
directly into my h
as well as some mild rosacea
i like the glass packaging
i kind of mimic washing my face with just water before using to ensure that my h
sulfates are bad for the skin in general
or alleviate dark circles
the liner goes on well
that the applicator was shaped differently
quick length, definition, volume and pigment!!!
i find i have to stir it every other day or 'oily' bits will seep to the top
my skin is regular
lightweight on the skin
it doesn't absorb all that well into skin.
dipping in your fingers over time not only destabilizes the product
it quickly sinks into the skin
sinks quickly into my skin
it caused more blockage for my breakouts
it was fast absorbing
also found it to slightly clog pores
it doesn't combine well with other exfoliative/enzyme products
if i skip the tidal
the texture is lightweight
i usually buy the clarins gel moisturerizer for combination normal skin
use this as an arm
lacks the essential ingredients for a great daytime product
it doesn't layer well with any of wide range of products i use during the day
i love multi-active day cream
too organic for me
the first few ingredients is a type of silicone which means it has the strong possibility of clogging your pores
this product has comedogenic silicone-based ingredients that will potentially clog pores
this is like a watered down version of the previous line
product leaks out of the pump as you try to dispense cleanser
tube was so easy to dispense.
all these creams have the same idea of light weight "water based" formulas that are good for oily skin because its not heavy
just dries very quickly
lightweight formula for the summer
doesn't absorb at all
spread the product out
this tends to absorb immediately with no significant benefit to the hydration of my skin
it immediately turns from cream to water.
it does sink in very quickly
the combination of high alcohol
will break out with silicon
it absorbs into the skin really quickly
it wreaked havoc on my skin
well this product is innovative
it definitely absorbs quickly
i've never gone through a serum so fast
does absorb fairly quickly
skate the product well before dispensing it into your palm for application to the face
smells good, absorbs quickly.
direct from the br
while it does provide a "blurring" effect
for a "mask" this absorbs so fast.
i even tried applying a 2nd layer
then generously spread on a 2nd layer 20 min later
should really be denser texture
except the entire point of most sleep masks is to provide hydration
avoiding my eye area
is suited for every skin
the pump makes it difficult to control the amount of product pumped out
goes well with makeup
started eliminating items from my routine
the cooling effect is amazing
this does leave you with a cooling effect
as the bottle directs
it oblast for about an hour
or mixed with it
except when you're in direct sunlight
love the light weight moisture
it will further exacerbate the skin problems.
can dilute this product
immediately splash with water?
the concept of individual balls is revolutionary
just because the capsules don't spread easily
i love the delivery system
after using this cream it has smoothed those lines out
the cream itself absorbs well
the odor barely dissipates through the day
although it says it lifts
the stickiness was not for me
my main concern is pores
topping it with different products
instantly makes your skin firm and tight.
it exaggerated every pore and imperfection.
as a primer it only works for the initial flawless application of makeup
i try to put on as thin a layer as possible
it is hard to put on evenly at 1st as this product is quite thick
it does get absorbed quickly
it gives you a smooth layer or canvas on which to apply make up
better face primers without all the headache
my estrogen levels plummet
with a smoother gel-like consistency
after around 2-3 weeks of continual use
tried to reconstitute with water
packaging seems to outweigh product, in the case.
is it possible for a product to make you more oily?
my makeup does go on smoothly when using this
does not blend well with other products.
works well before foundation
mixed with my foundation
i mixed it into foundation.
i layered it on top of the foundation.
doesn't remove excess oil
my foundation still settles into my pores
i even mixed it with the cover fx drops
this does nothing for reducing oil and shine.
tried it as a primer
mixing it with foundation
mixed it in with my foundation
i mixed it with my foundation
i already use primers
also, make foundation hard to blend.
the product description said it will "reduce the look of shine
this product when added into my foundation made it super thick
i've tried benefits matte rescue
as it worked to reduce the redness
which increases the look of dark circles
protect my eye area
once it is absorbed into the skin
makeup can be applied easily over it without slipping
i find it doesn't fully absorb
merely sits on top of the skin
all of which proved ineffective
it also failed to absorb quickly enough in the mornings
i developed more lines
which may have been the pore clogging ingredients
beware, this can clog pores.
which helps absorb the oil
when the humidity is lower
the water content was low
rich on your skin
the b hydra mixed with a few drops of their marula oil is plenty
it also had a weird dimethicone silicon texture despite being silicon free
look for more complex formulations that took effort to develop
i did my normal skin care routine
also has been clogging my pores a bit from the heaviness of the product
love their acne clearing solution
this product just exacerbates that
it does not illuminate
nor does it provide much moisture at all
i see some mixed it with foundation
or a thin layer of cover up
i mixed it in with my foundation
this works best by itself or blended into foundation
i'd use the benefit watts up
it acts more like an illuminating primer
have it absorb quickly for makeup application than this will do the job
it also has a strong scent
i prefer that they stay hidden or at least minimized under makeup
the benefits are thin to non-existent
under medium coverage foundation
this isn't a daytime product
it works well under makeup to create a smooth base
i usually stay away from all illuminators as they seem to accentuate large pores
this product makes a lot of woo-woo claims about stem cells
ideally help prevent breakouts
exchanged it for my other cleanser
it foams up nicely
they need to work on a more sturdy material.
this helps the larger pores on my nose
only use this to cover pores
this works as a primer.
it takes more than an hour for my skin to completely absorb it
i typically use a primer from smashbox
when i'd use it before or after makeup for blurring or dryness
when combined or layered over this it did not.
this is the opposite of lightweight.
their essence for normal skin types
i found that the thickness of the product
nor does it prevent/reduce/block oil production or affect the appearance of pores
it had the downfalls of a pore-filling product
it does blur my large pores
it works well under primer.
it took a little time to absorb
by attempting to combine a primer
i neither moisturizes nor primes that effectively
the additional non-greasy moister was great
it smoothes out uneven texture
i'll stick to their dramatically different gel.
after it absorbs for a while
in a somewhat wiping motion
the product doesn't flow freely onto the roller ball
feels heavy on the skin
my pores instantly shrunk
after incorporating this product into my routine
while i liked that it absorbed quickly
after my skin absorbed it
after it soaks in pretty quickly
the effect of it gets compromised
this product is just designed to create a barrier on the skin
the bottle is poorly
also long lasting on the skin
this only tends to exacerbate that
it eliminates the need for a primer
cannot endure the intense artificial smell
it goes on smooth
the strong smell dissipates
it went on nicely and absorbed quickly.
has some oil control properties
pores look smaller by illusion
still have some lightweight moisture
without various other pore primers
as well as with
the application is so smooth
lightweight feelthe bad: too much glitter
was a complete oil slick by the end of the workday
reduce the size of my pores
turns out super oily as the day progresses
it did not absorb into my skin at all.
the tackiness can act as a primer
didn't absorb as quickly as i'd hoped
this packaging sets it apart
instead of the fresh smell that characterized the other items this smells like a chemical mess
it went on fairly evenly
when it dries its such a thin layer that its hard to peel off bought it
add some copper glitter
i only used a thin layer
peeling this off is such a hassle.
drying but average results
i normally like the smell of mixed drinks
yet effective enough to remove sebum/oil
am unlikely to repurchase as a drugstore micellar water works similar without the scent
the dispenser stopped pumping foam
how well it cleans
it felt smooth upon application
performance: it provides a deep cleaning
it does not absorb smoothly
the new applicator wastes product
does not work to blend
does not absorb - makes makeup peel off.
was so light that it smoothed on nicely
the booster does not absorb into my skin
delivery system is odd
this product works well with my combination skin
my skin is not absorbing it
i expected it to be cooling
quickly absorbs into the skin
the part where the paper covers the bottle
the product was absorbed
it was ineffective at removing my makeup especially around the eyes
effective at removing makeup
this may clean well
my nightly beauty routine should be effective
i like that it can provide instant moisture.
as it works well
it was like putting a mixture of oil
slow to absorb on my skin
it does absorb quickly
i believe it is the serum aspect that hinders quick absorption
even stickier on my face
which took micellar water
the consistency is thin
with miniscule amounts of plant extracts
my only con is the stickiness of it
it dissipates before you even finish applying
have to apply an extra layer over it
this product doesnt absorb onto my face
it keeps my skin oil free
i would need to blot
it blends well with my foundation
spf needs to be higher than 30 according to my dermatologist
absorbs into the skin quickly
it definable takes off all my makeup in my opinion
wasn't that easy to spread
on top of the producting feeling like it didnt absorb the appearance is less dewy
i tried layering foundation over it
it does illuminate well
this cleanser is effective in removing makeup
micellar water for about a month or two
not absorb into the skin
it does not absorb well at all
does not absorb into the skin

my pores clog easily
was hoping that the oil would help decongest my skin
such as my contour/lower jaw area
shortens the wear time of my makeup significantly
any mask could bring that cleanliness.
unfortunately applying the mask evenly is difficult because of the pulp like consistency
they could've easily blended the chunks in since it wasn't contri
the product itself has a texture much like a condensed jam
it's kind of hard to evenly distri
once i got past the unpleasant application process
didn't blend in well.
i love fresh and use a lot of the rose products.
it reminded me of jam or preserves
it is 50 percent fruit with the main active ingredient being derived from the fruit
the tool is cool
just need some firming
improved" version of their clinical dark spot corrector
i would dispense 1/2 a pump
with the double spout
sinks into the skin well
if you relied more upon an airless treatment pump
has two problems:--it illuminates more than it moisturizes
--it runs out fast
really did nothing to illuminate the skin
the upside to it is the smell does subside as it absorbs into skin
dries a bit white if not blended well
the product doesn't absorb well
highlights them instead of masking them
other reviews suggest being judicious in your application
it's an effective mask
the fact that it is self foaming
it does help improve tone
its easier to peel off than the black mask.
you have to apply a thick layer to be able to peel it off
the product doesn't apply evenly
the new formula is thin
average peel off mask
this is a good basic eye cream for minimal needs.
to optimally evaluate the product
also, the product does not absorb well at all.
since it had all natural ingredients
i've tried it on multiple types of breakouts
it foams and heats up on my face.
smooth after i use it
t's probably a chemical mixing issue
honey products start to lose their activeness over time
also my bee venom cream gives better result
new day cleansing grains though
it did not clean my skin effectively
it will accentuate all the dry parts
it works well in unison with the soy face cleanser
continuous quenching so oil based products work better for me
while i like the theory behind this treatment
it is an unnecessary added chemical that tends to irritate skin or cause breakouts
it is heavily rose fragranced.
contains mineral oil as the main ingredient
expensive for a product where the entertainment is the magnet that removes the product off the face
then i like the wow factor of using the magnet
goes on smooth with the spatula that is provided
the magnet in theory is compelling
if you get the cream on the magnet
i could get these results by using a heavy moisturizer
upon removal it was messy
product kept sticking to magnet through the tissue
made it difficult to move the magnet from the tissue once it had collected enough product
no lifting or firming
main ingredient is iron powder
while it is "fun" to remove the product like your face is an etch a sketch
it applies very smoothly
so many tissues to remove all of the mask
poor design on the jar as well
once the magnetic novelty of this new mask wears off
then deal with the magnetic mess that ensues
the iron will stick itself so firmly to the magnet that the tissue rips
the instructions want you to use a tissue between your magnet
the iron dust so you can keep your magnet clean
it will likely wreak havoc
it says use one to two drops daily
i've never had a product deplete that quickly
the texture makes it nearly impossible to apply an even layer
had high hopes for this cleanser
the ph is on the high side
a higher ph can strip your skin
be sure to follow with a balancing toner to restore your skin mantle
minus 1 star for packaging.
i will dispense into a plastic bottle
quickly discovered that the dispenser was leaking
it serves good as a second cleanse step
it takes off my makeup semi easily
it goes on smoothly
my skin absorbed it
this one is light weight
i washed my face with my clarisonic as per norm
then followed my usual routine of utilizing my beauty oil
had to apply another layer to alleviate it
three starts for my oily zone improving
for a non greasy quick absorbing lightweight texture
my skin is average
i try and use cleaner more natural products.
improve the quality of my skin
a good product for younger skin looking to prevent aging
applying my usual rich night cream over it
reduce it over time
when using beauty blender it covers my face a bit more natural
that kind of defeats the purpose of a color corrector
i used thin layers
i've had to mix the product into a mixture of cream foundation
the video showed how it covered up blemishes flawlessly
also really cakey from using 2 highcoverage products on top of each other
i will continue to experiment with various brushes
i prefer a natural look
the coverage does work to cover redness
there are tons of melting oil
it doesn't clean as well or quickly as an oil
which allows it to be more effective
the milk it melts into is al
have combo/normal skin
this is more like an oil based remover that you wipe off
purity by philosophy works better.
quickly emulsifies with water
effortlessly takes off stubborn makeup
this product works well to remove makeup
i also noticed that it has mineral oil in it.
it removes make-up well
which is irregular for me
definitely didnt minimize any pores.
foundation with high expectations
many primers do that as well
have tried many pore filling primers
it did not refine my pores
the product also separates in the tube
it really minimized my pores
the primer has separated
squeezing it to see if i could "mix" the contents
it does create a smooth surface
2 stars for ease of use
it is super heavy so apply it to undereye area was a struggle
eyes are dryer than usual!!!
foundation went over it smoothly
beware: this product goes from fresh to stale at lightning speed
the search continues for a miracle under eye cream
there was zero hydration.
it lacks the moisture i need
will use up this supply along with grape seed oil for undereye area
besides the intolerable smell
the thickness of the product
the cream is not transforming
i usually buy belief moisture bomb
i will return to my moisture bomb
does not absorb at all
slow absorption make it a poor fit for my skin type
caused smaller breakouts all over
their amazing sheet masks
closed comedones from this
less like an effective concealer unless i apply multiple thick layers
reducing redness was a bonus
despite the high spf
i tried to use a moisturizer to make it blend easier
the product barely color corrects
the product also leaves my face lighter than my skin tone
which defeats the purpose
the fact that this treatment is said to neutralize redness was very appealing to me
whether i applied a hearty amount of the product or a light layer to my face
i'll stick with applying my regular light color corrector
it actually enhanced my pores
even with a setting powder.
this does neutralize it
when my work stress drops
the color correcting treatment was a bonus.
did not stay on evenly
by midday it is even oilier.
matches my skin well
the color blends in well initially
this product does a decent job of efficiently removing all types of makeup without clouding your eyes
i closely follow instructions
even other charcoal products
i even double cleansed
looks like tiny spores growing all over it
i tested its efficacy using a make-up wipe
it removes my makeup
right now i use micellar water w/ cotton pads
faster i can do it at my vanity desk
as opposed to melting into an oil
i notice very minimal hydration
my skin does not absorb the product
as it does not absorb
it was like using a typical
doesn't absorb well into my skin
replaced that with this cream
it still won't absorb
it remains at the surface of the skin
helped shrink my pores
it definitely shrinks pores
it never fully absorbed.
heavy on my skin
hoping that it would absorb
the product spreads easily
it does not absorb well
it feels heavy on skin
it did not absorb into my skin
don't anticipate a d breakouts with this cream
ter is hailed for its protective
other natural active elements
ter aids with the re-hydration of dry
ter is solid at room temperature
reduce a very faint fine line
like permanent wave solution
provides some oil control
i typically wear bb cream or light foundation
on the plus side, it's non-drying.
used the sephora triple action cleansing powder
i find the oil is great for makeup removal
it dries up fast
won't buy it again due to the stickiness
is nothing more than a run of the mill vegetable based cleansing bar
double cleansing is already part of my skin care routine
it removed most of my makeup
which is the main reason i double cleanse
i applied step 2, the cleansing bar.
it also caused my skin to purge severely
how it removes my makeup
while not stripping it
the oil part of the cleanse cannot be used alone like other cleansing oil
this oil needs to be dissolved
the oil to this doke cleanse set is really heavy
as someone who regularly oil washes
is as natural as it gets
it comes with an oil
the oil part of this cleansing set worked well at removing my makeup
the oil removed my makeup just as most oils.
my normal cleansing routine has always been a 2 steps process
maybe pair the oil with a corresponding liquid cleanser in a pump bottle instead
the concept of double cleanse
i like the duo concept of a cleansing oil
the packaging design made storage easy
it caused more breakouts
all the natural oils from my face were gone
the oil comes out way to fast
it almost feels like a semi silicone primer
this product is mixed for me.
the double cleanse concept
it does remove makeup well
easy to incorporate into my skin car routine
after i decided to deal with the scent i made the mixture with the measurements the instructions said
it does not apply smoothly, sort of thick.
will cause irritation beyond imaginable
i just use it as a primer for my powder highlight
it would be amazing under foundation since this is super holographic
in direct sunlight it looks ridiculous
the excessive amount of glitter is too much to h
it helps highlight my cheekbones even more!!
the sparkles were covert operatives
the glitter was extreme
nothing natural about it at all
i plan on thoroughly double cleansing
masking my face tonight in hopes of eradicating all the glitter
one uses micro glitter
apply before foundation or foundation powder.
also like to apply just a minimal amount after concealer under eyes with ring finger
applying it again below eyes over makeup end of day is difficult to blend
good for eye self massage because of a smoothing effect of dimeticone
the main ingredient is not something that can even penetrate skin
long term use of dimethicone makes the skin drier because it disrupts the skin's natural ability to hydrate
skin becomes dependent on the synthetic oil.
it absorbed into the skin quickly
absorbs quickly for make up application
in terms of reducing fine lines
this product goes on smooth and absorbs quickly.
not genetic dark circles might find it more effective
it definitely helps with puffiness almost instantly
my skin absorbed it rather quickly
smooths out the undereye a bit
works well underneath my foundation
it absorbs super quick around the eye contour
the product is lightweight
absorbs easily into the skin
it is a great addition to my nighttime routine
it never fully absorbs into skin
don't think absorb fast enough.
topping it off with a thick moisturizer to prevent further damage
i love the packaging and that it absorbs quickly.
this product has the texture of a pore smoothing primer
it goes on very smoothly
helped smooth fine lines
the product wouldn't absorb
it also had a sticky consistency
there is an uneven sheen from the primer that ends up emphasizing the pores on my face
it is very light feeling/ absorbs quickly
it’s just that “dewy glow” from the light-reflecting substances in the primer
my makeup lasts way longer with other primers
it goes on smoothly
it goes on smoothly
telling me that it colour corrected with particles
it does work well as a primer
i sometimes use sephora's micellar water to cleanse my skin without any real issues
as it doesn't remove makeup as well as the micellar water
struggles to remove my non-waterproof eye makeup
it did foam that easily.
it cleans most makeup well
like purity made simple
no foam which is fine
love the pump/packaging
the ingredient list shows it's packed full of silicones with any useful
my skin type is normal.
removed excess after 15 minutes
i typically love masks
i found the product to be rather thin
expected the product is heavy
it smooths on nicely
works well as a primer.
cons - doesn't moister well.
helps foundation wear all day
the makeup lasts all day
applied "liberally" this $140 product.
absorbs into my skin
that would absorb into my skin quicker
although it does absorb quickly
mainly to oil-free products
the foundation is pilling as in
it is heavy with silicones which just left a layer of film on top of my skin
moral of the story: always patch test!
i also felt like it was clogging my pores.
they praised it for its potent hyaluronic acid in it
all it does is provide the smooth glide over ease over the face
it's just multipurpose and vet convenient.
t's pores no more primer
the pores no more primer is everything
large pores are par for the course
the pores no more primer is h
i found the formulation to be an effective oil controlling primer
it does manage to blur skin a bit
works well as a primer
it can be blended to a point
if i blended any more
the spf, the no pore look, the ease of use.
the formula inside the sponge dried up very quickly
did really well to get rid of any excess oil that i accumulated during the day
it removes all the foundation
the packaging is cheap feeling
it's a cushion foundation package
it absorbs oil and provides a matte appearance.
although this product delivers on its matte promise
then apply the "liquid" with the sponge
controls the shine like any other blotting product
wearable formulas on the market
this product lacks elegance and is unacceptable.
i'd tolerate all of this for a waterproof
is a must to have sun protection
creates a greasy base unsuitable for makeup application over top
shows no signs of replenishing your skin
can lead to irritation not only on the surface
in deeper layers of skin
i've followed the usage directions
it works well without causing irritation.
when the boscia oil-free daily hydration was discontinued
poorly absorbs into skin
it is fully absorbed
additionally it made my skin flake.
it dries up quickly
the gel/cream sounds interesting in theory
don't get much by way of benefits over the argan oil
i can get more from the intensive lotion
it absorbs fast into my combination skin
such as help with controlling oil
i found this to soak in faster
glass portion contains the concentrate
claimed to be instant skin changer
mixes well with other products
not fast to absorb so nighttime use only
t was hard to spread evenly on my face
it does absorbs quickly though
quickly fights the signs of aging
it feels like i'm spreading
it hasn't caused additional clogged pores or breakouts for me
if not, get tidal!
it seems that the stability of the product is jeopardized by the oxygen exposure
i found this to absorb pretty quickly
make it more liquids by mixing it with my oil free lancôme spf
i will only be sticking with tidal
while i find that the tidal one doesn't
doesn't absorb into skin
did not absorb into my skin at all
it foams up slightly
this may not be gentle enough even though its sulfate free
product works well at cleaning face
constantly had mild breakouts
while my acne breakout started to subside after 2 uses
which is normal while your skin adjusts to a new formula
also does not absorb as quickly as some of the others i have tried
time to switch to a more natural brand.
it doesn't go on smoothly
this formula causes my foundation to oxidize so much that it looks orange
which should be expected with a product made of kelp
the problem is that anti oxidants
oxidize quickly when in contact with air
wonder how the anti oxidants contained in this product are stabilized in an open jar container
healthy skin is the result of a system
my main skin concerns are moister and anti-aging.
is an elite line
the coverage is light
it's absorbed very quickly
it doesn't absorb oil
this product can also be worn under your make to create a smooth canvas for your foundation
the smart filtering serum is a good addition to the shiseido range
it helps close my pores
the product absorbs quickly onto the skin
the best one to work for me is as a pore reducing serum on days i'm not putting any foundation over top
really reduces the look of my pores
it acts as a smart filter
i'll keep it focused where i want to blur pores
does help blur imperfections
it is a rather unique product that smoothes out the skin
i received the shiseido ibuki smart filtering smoother serum free for review
it offers zero moisture once absorbed
which it does quickly
there was no protective plastic lid over the product
the positive is that i like the lightweight
kinda pricey for an average eye cream
that it absorbs quickly
my primary concern is combating dark circles
it dries on top of it
it is heavy oil
as well as their other oil with the rose hip
i'd leave it to fully absorb for 3 hours
i like the pump dispenser
it says it "diminishes
prevents breakouts while soothing skin"
is that it takes a bit of time to absorb
power eye cream radical new age
i do like that it absorbs into the skin quickly
hydrator from the find your balance line
i found that it performed as an average "oil control" cleanser
i reduced the usage of it
it just lays on the surface
half a pump vigorously rubbed in will soak in.
i am blotting within 2 hours of application
that is with benefits porefector primer
which does soak in
decreases oil on my skin
the overall formula feels sticky after applying
this hydrator absorbed quickly into my skin.
along with the balancing toner
absorbs quickly into the skin
all 3 products in this line has a strong eucalyptus
it absorbed quickly into the skin
along with the cleanser
it also has the same strong eucalyptus
the skin adsorbs it quickly
the dispenser was inaccurate
application was inconsistent with the dispenser problems
even with setting powder
i tried using it lightly
sheerer alternative to a traditional foundation for spring
like every other slow
i personally found that the serum did not absorb into my skin fully
this does nothing for smoothing of the eyes!
causes breakouts around the orbital bone
with or without makeup
regardless of skin care routine
didnt absorb too well either
when i applied straight to my face for hydration it took ages to absorb
it does not absorb into the skin.
it absorbs so fast
when i'd try mixing it with foundation
makes removal of the lipstick easier
from the description it says it’s suitable for oily skin
the first ingredient is water.
it absorbed so fast
it never fully absorbs into my skin
slick as an oil field
other than the meaningless gold infused marketing
this product works well as a makeup primer
after integrating it into my skin care routine
all skin types widely vary
the dropper is actual glass
helps minimize the look of my pores
helps with my makeup application
the smell is manageable.
it absorbs fairly quickly
prefer a more natural/toned down look
the rose gold elixir is a much better choice.
it smelt so strongly
ssssttoooooppppp with the excessive fragrance
primer which works well
which means your skin will react when exposed to the sun
it was recommended to me as a balancing cleanser that would reduce environmental irritation
it easily removes eye makeup as well as waterproof mascara which is impressive
does removes everything as intended
probably due to butylene glycol
saw that their's contained dimethicone
this product is strictly for people with oily skin
this new formula is greasy
it takes a while for it to be smooth
if the temp is low
compared to origins oil-free night cream
gross it doesn't spread properly
the new formula is thick
this new formulation is much heavier
the new one is heavy and sticky.
this new formula is thick
the new formula leaves a white film on top of your skin
it did nothing towards its claim as a pore vanishing primer
it is sticky and does not absorb into the skin.
this is a complete reformulation of the classic
the ingredients are vastly different
the pump up top pushes through too much liquid
simple has a very similar micellar water with no scent for a quarter of the price
the pipette doesn't hold the formula
it would be much better in an airless bottle.
it takes a while to absorb
it doesn't completely absorb into the skin
s down love the extended thirst relief cream
i love the clinique moisture surge line
then becomes completely ineffective
variants on the market
the mask is in 2 parts
keep smoothing it out for it to work
on arms etc- recommended not to as its sticky
due to product being layered underneath the mask
the mask fell apart easily which made for a complicated application
the mask aspect of it is a little different from other sheet masks
the mask does wear easily over the serum it comes with to allow for ample time to absorb
the mask aspect of it is a little different from other sheet masks
the mask does wear easily over the serum it comes with to allow for ample time to absorb
compared to their vital hydra mask
i would recommend the vital hydra
many better moisturizers at lower prices
sits on top of the skin rather than absorbing into it
i believe it was the gold particles in it
my pores have minimized
caused breakouts all over.
it does absorb well
as a lower-priced alternative to la mer gel cream
cheap cream for 3$ leaves same effect on the skin
it was kind of sticky,slow to absorb.
the cream consistency makes it hard to spread
namely the alpha beta daily peel
along with the ceo oil
combined it with the fairly new clinique fresh pressed serum
the way it absorbed quickly into the skin that i would like it
the encapsulated water "rises" to your skin's surface after a minute or two
another de product that remains sticky on the skin for a while
my dark circles are genetic.
because it preserves the ingredients
it also wears well under makeup.
it is fast-absorbing as well as slightly firming
the consistency is so thin
the fact that it has no scent that i can detect
while it does remove makeup
the lid cannot be closed tightly
if used to remove eye makeup
removed my makeup easily
hope it gets reformulated or a gentler version comes out
even when i closed the bottle as tightly as i could
completely removes makeup better than most cleansers i've tried
continued using it for both cleansing
is more drying than the juju bar
i advise anyone who purchases this to close the lid tightly beyond the click
as far as the actual function of the cleanser
collects bacteria after every single use
the stick contains microbeads
the saving graces include it not being drying
it uses microbeads that are known to cause environmental damage
also holds water in the tube
which could be a breeding ground for bacteria
this cleanser is nice i can see the appeal due to how compact it is
the benefits cannot outweigh the awful scent
it doesn't spread evenly
use at the risk of your nasal passage.
when you activate the crystals with water you have to be careful how much pressure you apply
it smells super gross.
it foams up easily enough
countered with some lotion and all is good.
the ball shrinks when drying
store it as directed as well
is because it shrinks so quickly
so it was slowly dissolving before being used.
removes make up well
it is a blast to cleanse with
that it is shrinking quickly
will be switching to a different charcoal cleanser
this is a basic mask
however purchased their lotus youth preserving cream several times
it sinks in quickly upon application which is nice
the issues that make me give it three stars is that this contains sodium hyaluronate
this also contains lemon
but they dissolve almost instantly.
have also layered it with other products
i've also used it during the day because it behaves well with my oily skin
when applying the mask
by applying a thin layer
is easy to apply with fingers
reactive skin which breaks out easily from the wrong products
no breakouts from it
that's only because i don't have extensive experiences with serums
it does get absorbed very quickly
it also roll into tiny balls under some primers
this is also goes very well with turbo booster c powder
it doesn't absorb very well
i do mix this every few days with the turbo booster c powder
the elevate cream contains gold particles
as alguronic acid which is in the majority of algenist products
you'll see there are a tonne of beneficial hydration
i assume to aid in firming?
a slew of other beneficial ingredients
heavier mask to wear overnight
normally use clinique moisture surge overnight mask
it does absorb quickly making it feel less like a mask
while it didn't absorb
although it had a cooling effect
i've tried a couple of laneige products with mixed results
the scent is so heavy
if, your skin handles the product well.
due to the high amounts of alcohol
it helps to remove shine
use this after to lessen the shine
use the spf/environmental protection daily
the spatula that magnetizes to the top is so unique
their packaging is always great with the magnetic spatula that sticks to the lid
this also contains denatured alcohol which is thankfully near the bottom of the ingredient list
when i'm sketchy about the ingredients
kaolin as the first ingredient
could be the strong fragrance added to this mask
i like to use different kinds if masks from mud to gel
it spreads easily onto the skin
see if this mask produces results
i quickly applied my clinique moisture surge to try to salvage my skin
in an air conditioned room
the white cast eventually dissolves
the smell is tolerable
need a low maintenance routine
there is no moisturizer that can boost your energy
on the shade range
it makes sense due to the spf
it blended out ok
created extra shininess to my skin by the end of the day
due to aging i'm getting fine lines.
which is necessary for akin repair
see how my skin progresses
the product felt heavy
after the product had all night to absorb
seems to take a while to absorb into my skin
for use for anti-wrinkle or anti-dark circle
also this product is hard to absorb into my skin
feels like average sephora under eye cream
most likely from the air pollution
calms down the skin
will probably use a micellar water beforeh
since it is a gel consistency
it really smoothes them down
this new "look" comes with a new watered down formula loaded with fillers
pore size or smoothness though
i also think that it might have been internally drying therefore increasing sebum production
which of course gives a tightening effect
i've begun to use it during the daytime with some of the givenchy prisme libre powder over to keep it light
it absorbed into my skin quick
as well as the formulation
i found it didn't absorb well into my skin
what is if formulated to do
it foamed up fairly well
required multiple passes with the cleanser
my skin is overworking to regain balance
boscia warms on contact with water
within hours my skin starts to become bright because its shiny from the excess oil my skin has produced from being over dried
i do enjoy how light weight
i recommend this for normal skin types.
it is so thin in consistency
throughout the day i noticed that instead of counteracting my oiliness it just appears to add to it
it immediately clogs pores
too many pore clogging properties
my skin absorbed it nearly instantly
it then compensates by making my face super oily
only use if your skin does not react negatively to dimethicone
it didn't absorb well into the skin
for some reasons it doesn't absorb well
using my usual primer
which can cause reactions
the new formula contains alcohol
the product absorbed very easily
lower on the actual product packaging include orange extract
the problems with this product are the stickiness
which i don't like in face treatment products since they are an irritant
essential oil or otherwise
my skin still feels tight from the stickiness for at least a half our after
if the balance is off it goes into high gear trying to moisturize itself by overproducing sebum
unable to test out its effectiveness for scarring
i found that it was not effective in reducing pore size
heavy throughout the day
not absorbed into it
i developed little white heads from using this product
this is a thick cream that takes a substantial amount of time to fully absorb
live i the harshest of climates- avoid
too soon to tell regarding wrinkle reducing properties
this product is not absorbed by the skin.
fresh all day without getting the "shine" that oily products can create
s to be able to spread it smoothly
so this was definitely the source of my clogged-pore problem
for containing ingredients linked to developmental
powered through the smell
it doesn't dissipate throughout the day
i find this product absorbs so slowly
my face can barely absorb it
my skin won't absorb it at all.
the product is effective
e product evenly over face
the new formula does not immediately absorb
it doesn't absorb well
it absorbs very quickly
does nothing for my skin in terms of delivering moisture
does not blend into sin smoothly
t does spread easily as you
the formula now is completely different it is lighter in texture
i know there's a "purging" phase where the skin just needs to adjust to the product
it isn't uncommon to have an initial purge with retinols
because i'm now dealing with hyperpigmentation from the breakouts
the wax in this cream formula could be problematic for other skin types
keeping acne under control
i felt like this product was constantly purging my skin
making concealer easier to put on
it is absorbed so quickly
provides decent moisture for the delicate eye area
or dark circles as is promotes
the gel sits on top of the skin
such to disappear cause it won't with this eye gel
the product is light
there is only product basically around the outer edge of the container only
no benefits or retained moisture.
hoping that i'll love it as much as the toner
after changing of packaging from tube to jar type
it didn't absorb oil
this takes forever to soak in making it suitable as a night cream
that it's a tube which i find more cleanly
i continued to use this product because i'm acne prone
my makeup goes on smoothly
it absorbed almost instantly.
no calming or moisture to speak of.
using it as a typical cleanser
so - no on the cleanse.
it has a powerful scent now
stung immediately upon using
i specifically requested a cleanser that removes makeup
i've tried other milk cleansers at a much lower price
it still needs to cleanse
the buildup is in your pores
also tissuing off the product day by day will potentially over exfoliate your skin
as well as the formula
other reviews have recommended using a cotton pad during removal
additionally the product has been modified.
plenty of other cleansers that are gentler
gives me more clogged pores
or probe even normal skin
the twisty part at the bottom also kept breaking
there's a sizable flexible plastic cap like a lip balm applicator on the top
liked the cooling effect it has
it minimized my acnes
the tube is poorly packaged
i've tried this on multiple blemishes
the product oozes out from the top to the bottom
this product relieves irritation
it didn't provide relief for redness or prevent bumps from forming
i found that a sulfur containing product was better for me
also wears nicely under makeup- no peelies.
it absorbs into the skin fairly quickly
no amazing anti aging properties.
which helps foundation application
it is non greasy and absorbs rather quickly.
even with prolonged usage
as for diminishing fine lines
it does not absorb well
the texture is lightweight
lacks on the brightening part
nor dies it brighten
it sent my skin into oil production overdrive
its lighter than i'm used to
soften up with a facial oil before using this clenser
the cleansing power is pretty minimal
my skin didn't develop new breakouts
i do use micellar water to take it off though
advertises as "removes makeup"
it did nothing to help control/prevent breakouts
it also caused my pores to clog.
i would recommend the murad clarifying wipes instead
improved with use of a clarisonic unit
it upside down very easily
how it will "get to the root" of problem pores
my pores were unchanged.
i found it difficult to layer makeup over this product
my makeup settles around the pores
just emphasizing the pore more
picture porefect does not minimize the appearance of pore
i think it helps my pores look smaller.
my pores did shrink though
i'd rather have large pores
the new formulation is thicker
the specialists suggested using this moisturizer as it would calm
my poor skin was going through some hormonal imbalances
this cream reduces my redness only temporarily
now i use the murad anti aging/anti acne line with much better results
that the reason behind the pump is to keep the product sterile
especially the daily face peels
it stings both under
it uses a lot of water to get the clay to the face
as this is clay
has not helped with breakouts
was hoping for this to shrink my pores
it wasn't the "deep clean" or "pore cleansing" quality i expected
although i like the idea of selling clay in a compact bar
used it as a body mask
tried as spot treatment as well
needs lots of water to spread.
shoulders as i tend to get blemishes on these areas periodically
it dries out quickly
the texture was as well
in the milk version
its hard to remove it with this cleanser
requiring extra attention to cover up
summarizing: if your boyfriend wants a pore cleansing solution
one last thing: the smell is penetrating
it also claims makeup removal
the negative: this is a not an effective cleanser to remove makeup
the oily consistence only makes removal harder
which are deep inside
smooth after i use it
it felt like shortening at application
kind of exaggerates my pores when i apply makeup
even with a pore filling primer
it also doesn't absorb into the skin
makeup doesn't blend at all when used along with this product
establishing a routine that works for me
which often causes more oil production since the skin has to compensate
the excess oil production caused me to breakout
she has normal skin
second ingredient is listed as toxic.
it seemed to absorb quickly
allowing foundation to go on smoothly
still provide some level of hydration
for foundation i use a full matte finish product
kind of defeats the purpose
also provide a more matte finish
it does get absorbed quickly in to my skin
dark spot correcting claims
it sinks in quickly
even helped slow some breakouts down
which is difficult to produce from plants
absorbs quickly into the skin
the product is light weight
reduces existing dark spots
found the experts opinion to be: "eye contour gel is primarily water
for a product that is specifically designed to decrease puffiness
reduce sodium intake will be the solution for this problem after all
addresses hydration but that's about it.
although i lead a very healthy life style
loss of elasticity around my eye area
true formulas from now on that contain peptides
i expected some benefit of hydration
it does disappear quickly into the skin
which one would expect for being part of the restorative line
i used sephora's written reviews to help narrow the search for puffy under eyes
it moisturizes but only temporarily!
varied the amounts of use
hoped this balm will help my skin tone
applied foundation as usual
there is not point because applying makeup on top of this is a nightmare: it dries very quickly
is impossible--the product starts to peel off.
being a frequent traveller who wants to look fresh
my face instantly pruned up
it stripped away all my natural moisture
avoid the eye area.
with consistent small breakouts every now
i still love the idea of a pore-refining cleanser
have to be removed manually
it's been difficult to find products that help me treat enlarged pores
which usually benefit from a robust cleanser
the pump is hard
not heavy at all
e it to a better overall regime
stick with the pores no more vaccuum cleaner alone
my face is slowly returning to the sensitive
well absorbed by the skin
the vacuum treatment quickly loosens blackheads
minimize the look of my pores
like the controlling oil production part
my regular anti-aging spf during the day
after using this diligently as directed
with no permanent clogging
creating a nice evaporating effect
the bottle suggests putting the gel in the freezer for the best effect
think my skin is sensitive to the menthol used as a counter-irritant in this product
unlike the old style that cleanly
conservatively pumped the gel out
additionally, it left a residue on my face.
it has a similar sticky feel after application
after the product absorbed
despite how rich the cream is
the high percentage of shea
ter mixed with the other thicker
exchanged it for the lighter weight face cream
however it contains only 5% of shea
dryer environment inside due to increased heating
i needed instant replenishing
it instantly reduced the dryness
it did not provide a cooling sensation at all.
like the tube packaging rather than the normal tub form
fresh like the rest of the essential c line
it feels like it absorbs in
i need a multi-function product-lines
my pores are the same
as for the cell turnover
i like that this dissolves quickly into my skin
is a good daily spf
it goes on well under powder foundation.
used just a minimal amount thinking the oiliness was a result of using too much product
i think the main problem with this is it doesn't absorb into the skin
this moisturizer does not quickly absorb into the skin
it has an ingredient octinoxate that is not the greatest of things to have absorb into a human body
it says apply liberally
it goes on smooth
my skin type is combination
this one absorbs quickly
it evaporated pretty quickly
the cream just does not absorb into the skin
it did not absorb into my skin at all
irritating throughout the day
it also takes a while to absorb in to my face before i can put powder foundation on
it doesnt absorbed quickly on my skin like the other viewers claimed
this cleanser is average
my skin adjusted as i continued to use it
the fact that it absorbed quickly
this product doesn't absorb into my skin
the tester had an undesirable smell
hoping it would dissipate
didn't really absorb properly
goes on smooth and sinks in.
thick white stuff that doesn't absorb or blend easily or quickly
it smooths on nicely
there is a little "plug" of semi-hardened product that comes out at the start
if its formulated without all those chemicals
cucumber mask will have a similar effect without breaking the bank
its a clear gel mask thats slightly cooling to the skin
mixing in a few essential oils
would absorb into my skin
this product works well under makeup.
it applies more evenly
protects from strong winds
my normally clear skin developed some break-outs
the heavy artillery in this cream might be too overwhelming for you
hydrates for a long period of time
loss of volume under eyes
this could be related to maybe needing a different product- one that boosts collagen/volume
i don't see any anti-aging effect.
this goes on smoothly
it leaves some stickiness
additionally once it dried
it does not absorb well at all
the cream is easy to spread
it disappears fast upon application
the consistency was more liquid-y
it wouldn't absorb all the way into my skin
applying this felt light
specially in winter time i have breakouts around my mouth
it should haven more moisture
it just does not absorb into the skin
when i first apply it the lines seem to soften
allow five minutes to allow it to absorb before concealer
upon application it separates into a watery substance
such as this sports mineral oil as a main ingredient
it doesn't absorb quickly
it interfered with my eye makeup
i've used a full tube without residual hydration or wrinkle reduction
it came in the mini makeup optional skin kit.
i found it not easy to absorb.
the dead skin cells that help create the fine lines
the thickness of the formula made it a little difficult to spread around the eye without pulling on the delicate skin there
works well around the eyes
it didn't absorb into my face
wash my face more frequently
overall, it works well.
it acts like a regular cheap bar soap
it was only because it stripped my skin of all its natural oils
are not absorbed by the skin
promoting the formation of acne
unfortunately clinique doesn't create any men's products that are free of mineral oils
didn't absorb super well
did it fight gravity?
works well under makeup
i applied it normally
it won't help with acne or large pores.
yet effective toner so this is what was recommended
in the future i will stick with the comforting cream cleanser for removing makeup
it is good for reducing puffiness
this product was lightweight
it takes a while to absorb
the majority of my skin care routine consists of clinique products
dehydrated skin with minimal fine lines
don't expect it to reduce puffiness
needed something light that provides a little sun protection
as it gets absorbed
the flare ups dissipated
my skin started producing more oil
it covers the skin well
it goes by super fast
even $25 for the 1 ounce seems steep.
it slightly softens the skin i think you could find a drug store equivalent
this face mask works well.
the result is at best minimal
i felt it absorbed well into my skin
burn even though i avoided the orbital area
i am currently using retina micro to treat the reaction caused by this product
tried the benefait 50spf fluid also
i pat it onto my skin for it to absorb
had high expectations for this lotion
gross on my skin
though easily removed with my regular cleanser
this product removes makeup
i usually oil cleanse
in a long term block pores
formula is super light
loved it for minimizing my pores
i need the spf protection around the eyes
becomes hard on the tip
the texture is light-to-medium-weight
spf 15 plus it was on the rich side
just the sun factor counts.
use a more effective eye cream that does brighten
it absorbs really quickly
i also really appreciate products in pumps because it keeps the c from oxidizing faster than it already will
it did absorb quickly
it seems to protect my skin
average cleanser in my opinion.
have to use makeup removing sheets + clarisonic along with this product
good for generic cleansing
though i'm mostly not getting the "makeup removal" aspect
it wouldn't foam properly
for it being all natural products
cleans the skin, non-irritating.
not inducing any dryness
it does not clean properly
does not penetrate enough for a deep clean.
daily clogged pores on a face which normally is blemish free
it does cleanse well
it pairs great with clinique's moisture surge extrended thirst relief mostuirizer
its described as "non drying"
the clinique overnight moisture mask to return my skin to how it was previously
it helped my pores
it helps with pore diminishment
keep oil production at bay
i expected it to fill in my pores seamlessly
it fills in pores & quite light.
this primer is amazing for reducing the appearance of pores
i do not think it made my pores minimized either.
the primer reduced my pore size
has a cleaning supply smell
now i am going to try out the new urban decay one
please consider making an untinted version
it also seemed to clog my pores
it definitely minimized my pores
this primer will cause foundation any foundation to oxidize within minutes of applying
non-recyclable canister is very misleading
version is of a thinner consistency
it does balance out
when i apply a cc cream on top that provides a bit more moisture
really soaks in fast
it also led to some breakouts
something i've noticed with products that have more anti-aging ingredients
after a month of continuous use
it gets absorbed quickly2
it caused anything i layered on top to pill
does soak in well
it also seems to highlight my pores
it didn't absorb in
the texture is lightweight
it's absorbed fairly quickly
it goes on smoothly
dark circles are often at least partly genetic
it is lightweight compared to other spfs
did you blend into skin seamlessly.
once on my face it seems to evaporate to quickly
the way it blended onto my skin
dosent smell good dosen't absorbs quickly
i like the high spf
without the pore-minimizing aspects
the extra strength alpha beta peels
fills in your pores
i goes on easily
so never see the full affect of reducing blackhead/acne
i prefer lancome refill over this.
but the refill 3x does good job on my skin.
it goes on very smoothly
despite its great anti-aging claims
this just wouldn't absorb into my skin
giving my skin time to heal
i like this better than the argon oil
its consistency is thin and ineffective.
use a dedicated eye make-up remover for that
i wear the barest amount of foundation
does not remove makeup adequately.
i also typically have dewy skin during the day
water just skids across the surface
it works pretty well compared to makeup wipes
may remove makeup well
the balm format is the bomb!
product does effectively remove makeup
it does not absorb well into my skin.
i think it lacks the moisturizer component.
this moisturizer did not absorb.
my wrinkle was more defined in the morning
it is not "intensively addressing the lines" as it claims
like most of the shiseido products it goes on smoothly
that removes the print on the glass bottle
the scent was slow to wear off
you apply it, and never absorbed by the skin.
may be it is because the mineral oil
it is an extra heavy product
seems to be reducing wrinkles
such sticks to your face
revitalizing emulsion does not provide enough moisture
then it interacted with my acne medicine if i spread it too low
i do like that it absorbs well
mineral oil are used which are so awful for your skin
it definitely smoothes wrinkles
the temporary smoothing effect could turn into long term damage to my delicate skin under eyes
that spread everywhere because of the greasiness of this product
the product doesn't absorb into the skin
did not blend well with makeup
better suited as a foot cream
plus active ingredients break down quicker in a pot
it doesn't absorb well either.
overall hydration in my eye area
makeup removing wipes much better
it absorbs quickly and that's it.
it's the only one that prevents my foundation from oxidizing
don't absorb which is a total waste
it absorbs quickly into the skin
keeps the oil at bay
it absorbs quickly but and keep your face fresh.
my skin type is combination
doesn't absorb as well as something milky
this moistuizer seems to create more oil that it absorbs
has a cooling sensation once applied
layers well under foundation
that can cause breakouts
as opposed to controlling the excess oil
causes excess oil production
it's a lightweight gel that evaporates quickly
their benefiance wrinkleresist24 intensive eye contour cream is the best out there
i own the spy 18 brightening lotion for face
i found the cream was hard to apply evenly on the face
the cream tends to stay in one area
it provides plenty of moisture for my normal skin
it helps other brightening products to keep them faded
it absorbs quickly, and that's it.
it does foam well
double cleansing just to experiment
not strong enough for a deep cleaning
it is light and absorbs to the skin fast.
there is no oil control or oil-friendliness
does not absorb quickly or completely.
works for combinations skin
this moisturizer doesn't absorb well.
it contains foundation in it to make your skin look brighter
i would go for shishedo ultimate sun protection line for spf
as i spread this on my face
also, it feels a bit thin.
also at the same time provides sun protection
bottling too cumbersome to use
it brings fine lines
did not absorb quickly at all
this cream is so heavy that i had to stop using it 2x a day because it was causing moderate acne
it not not absorb quickly
have fine lines caused by dehydration
since it advertises that it targets puffiness
a toner removes more than this does.
no oil control, no balancing out my skin.
the claim that they helped with enlarged pores
even with the new pumps/acne flare ups
it is not "calming" in the least
this is a product you need to double cleanse with
preferably with a different cleanser after to remove all of the excess makeup it leaves behind
daily toxins are removed
not effective at cleaning pores.
it is not very effective at removing it without significant scrubbing with a washcloth
it drys almost instantaneously
when it seeps in near corners
i'll keep it just for cooling
too liquidly for me.
it seems like a different gel
it was light-weight
the dispensing pump is also difficult to use
after 2 pumps excess product comes out from all places wasting it
whose products formulated for sensitive skin
as a result my skin would overcompensate by secreting extra oil
makes applying it a chore.
also, the removal method is bizarre.
it will shrink your pools for a short while
usually go for more detoxfying masks of peels
it helps eliminate breakouts
tisi product claims to "this mask reduces the appearance of pore size
it works well as spot treatment on blemishes
rubbing briskly worked better
my spot treatments were more effective
it's the only wash that has effectively controlled my light acne
the packaging is heavy
the pump is poorly shaped
the squeezable tube from before was perfect in comparison
it is heavy and the pump is not convenient.
a glass bottle instead of the tube is not ideal
easy to transport when traveling
it did not prevent any breakouts or improve skin.
the new is a glass bottle
the old is plastic thus allowing easier use in the shower plus easier transport for travel
the bottle is heavy
its the only thing that controls my breakouts
the bottle is heavy
the actual cleanser gets 5 stars.
what i love about salicylic acid is that removes a lot of oil without stripping my skin
this wash does a poor job of removing oil
bases with 2% salicylic acid that are cheaper
used for two weeks to help control my moderate acne
i wanted something that would prevent as well as heal
this product has a strong medicine smell.
it helped a little in preventing more breakouts
which is usually flawless
clear gel works just as well for a fraction of the price
all the particles seem to dissolve completely
the "new formula" added orange peel extract
i will switch to a different cleanser that can be used daily without causing flakiness
the formula also smells different.
the exfoliating agent didn't effectively unclog my pores
i used proactive wash
this wash is more liquid
i did not know that it contains propylene glycol
i started developing clogged pores
the packaging needs a makeover
which is more organic
it seems to instantly shrink pores
reactive skin that's starting to show its first aging signs
i started to incorporate all kind of anti-aging products with chemical ingredients on them
reactive skin that's starting to show its first aging signs
i started to incorporate all kind of anti-aging products with chemical ingredients on them
yet fully absorbing consistency
it is not lightweight but absorbs nicely.
it doesabsorb quickly into the skin
overall was ineffective to maintain my skin oil free
i typically love the fresh line
easily absorbed by skin
application of this product doesn't interfere with makeup
while it is lightweight
their soy cleanser both being huge pluses in my book
does not blend as well as other brands.
absorbs into the skin well
it definitely gives a non clogging moisture benefit
i mainly suffer from pms breakouts
i love their anti aging line
even with two pumps
plus the foam disappears whenever i use it with my clarisonic
i used this product to try to clear up mild acne
this product works, but slowly.
it seems to be drying the area out extensively
i used this product in conjunction with the clinique 3 step acne system
needed something to relieve my skin
is still treated with ziana gel every night
use it in conjunction with 1/2 water
i usually use another dark spot corrector which worked
on top of that it clogs your pores
the second ingredient in this product is denatured alcohol which is harmful to skin
the smell did dissipate quickly
this ingredient causes free radical damage
continue to suffer from breakouts
t smooths in great with a moisturizer
as well as blemishes
after following the recommended routine of using a peel pad
so adding the night cream as the final step only augments the heaviness
it did nothing to reduce wrinkles or firm my skin
i much prefer his mega rich intensive anti aging cellular creme
the liquid version is much more effective
i must use an acne soap daily on my face in order to keep blemishes under moderate control
this soap works well on preventing
it has helped with my breakouts on my body
it keeps my face breakouts under control
now red marks + breakouts
i found this product affective
would rather buy a drugstore cleaner.
had high hopes for this cleanser
also felt stingy as i cleansed affected area
such as pre cycle breakouts
the pump top detached from the bottle
controlling some excess oil production
not effective at cleansing does not melt away makeup or impurities
while this product works fine as a regular daily cleanser
it twists to reveal a hole which the product comes out of
i prefer a pump or flip-cap.
or clean deep in the pours
i need something that deep cleans
natural makeup that i re-apply occasionally
works great with the other redness solutions products
it moisturizes adequately well
it gives it a cooling effect
it does take a good 5-10 mins to absorb
my skin gives me minimal issues
the moisture-restoring has happened
in my defense, "redness solutions" is misleading.
causes breakouts within a day or two
it is thick, but it absorbs quickly.
i am a normal skin type
it didn't seem like it adsorbed well into my pores after adding my normal moisturizer
t smooths your skin some
it makes more problems then it solves.
large groups of deep bumps.
acne prone skin tread carefully with this one
reduces the appearance of fine lines
it inevitably causes my to break out
perhaps the ingredients aren't as potent after a while
i've switched to using the algenist bi phase peel
my skin usually responds well to them
the lid falls out of my h
laa requires a carrier to penetrate the lipid barrier of your skin -- zero benefits
studies show that skin improvements require a concentration between 10%-20% to penetrate the lipid barrier
mixed this with my moisturizer for about a month in a half
i settled on the turbo booster powder.
while it seemed effective
settled on a much easier to use liquid serum instead
the pores seem smaller
despite blending it in well
as it pertains to actually lightening my dark circles
become more uniform with the rest of my facial skin
cheaper eye cream on the market
a little excess just sits there emphasizing my wrinkles
slowly not using it at all
the product began to peel
thick but fast absorbing.
that comes in the packaging
soften my skin again
if you layer it over rose seed oil it does a good job locking it in
only wish it minimized pore size.
works well with makeup
this stings upon application.
i feel like it does not absorb quickly
it absorbs well...at first.
it is a light gel-cream texture that absorbs quickly
it doesn't absorb well.
this product created a film
did not apply evenly
the fragrance is very slow to fade
this moisturizer does not absorb into my skin at all
did not spread well
it does contains a wheat ingredient
some manufacturers label products with this ingredient as "contains wheat
my makeup did not apply evenly over this product.
applied it on my face i automatically felt stinging
will keep it in my kit as a primer
can tolerate harsh products
it does absorb very easily
lightweight, non-greasy and absorbs quickly.
this did not penetrate through the surface
the toner opens your pores i guess to allow other products to work
put it non breakable container.
whichever one has the smaller particles
i love the high potency eye lift no bad reactions with that one
i'll sag not have lines
it absorbs immediately to my skin.
it absorbs quickly which i like
after using advanced eye area therapy
e to under eye circles
the "cream-lotion" takes quite a while to absorb.
i much prefer a heavier/creamier eye cream that actually absorbs
it cleans without stripping
along with the cold plasma disappointment
keep aging skin at bay
serums have a much greater degree of the active ingredients to repair
the container is maddening.
my skin type is normal.
the product said it was a solution for "dullness"
would pump out half liquid half foam
this product foams nicely
a straightforward cleanser that removes makeup
this is energizing on the skin
i switched to a different cleanser
my sensitive skin prevails again
of course, this is after oil cleansing!
it removes all my makeup with one wash
i used it for a quick wash
it absorbs super fast
supplement with my fresh seaberry oil
i suspect it's because of the inadequate hydration
it seems to be a natural
i found it to be way to lightweight
i want a more lightweight for daily use.
i normally have normal skin
it did not absorb
it also doesnt absorb quick
this cream has a medium consistency
it does absorb very quickly into your skin.
maybe i should have chosen the matte balancing fluid
you could layer spf on top of this cream
though this product is lightweight
it also didn't absorb well at all
everyone's skin reacts differently
as if my skin is struggling to perform its stretching duties
appreciate the pump packaging
no breakouts after using this product.
did not absorb well
my skin reacts poorly to creams of any kind
found that with use my pores became congested
the claim that they helped with enlarged pores
/or quality of my skin
does not absorb in at all
i typically love fresh products
seems like it sits on top of the skin without fully absorbing
a huge air bubble appeared
their quality control really lacks
did not absorb at all into my skin
does not absorb well into my skin
it takes hours to absorb into my skin-very unfortunate
takes a long time to absorb into the skin
this does not absorb.
it baffles me that anyone can claim that this is fast absorbing or lightweight
it does seem to absorb somewhat quickly
it doesn't outweigh how thick it was
the cooling effect it has on my skin
immediately after my skin feels smooth
this mask is cooling and soothing.
other steps to remove your makeup before you cleanse
this does remove impurities
the pump dispenses the product as a light foam.
upon contact on the skin
this is a good product to use quickly in the shower
leaves a gross film on my face
i like it because it cleans well
most micellar waters have just an opening with little control when pouring out the product
not for the heavy makeup user
it dissolves make-up quite well
the argan oil dispensed very quickly
it would not rub in or absorb into my skin
had to wipe off the excess off with a tissue
i've mixed it with out clarifying oils to put on my skin
the oil didnt penetrate my skin even after 30min of having applied it
as well as oils
you want to moisturize deeper into your skin
it attracts water to itself which in turn can create a plumping effect on the skin
you would then apply the product followed by a topical application of water mist which would then plump the product on the skin
have normal to combination skin
s to give maximum moisture
not sealed properly at the factory or something
the formula also pilled on my skin when applying makeup in spite of waiting a sufficient amount of time for the product to soak in
also use argan oil all over face
especially since i love the oxygen mask
it almost feels like mineral oil
this new formula caused my face to be very oily
although it absorbed quickly
it does easily blend in
it does not absorb quickly.
combination formulas with no problems
it induced huge red acne every time i've used it
it causes me to breakout
had anti-aging properties
it did absorb quickly
it breaks out easily
reacts to smallest of changes in my skin care regime
clinique changed the formula
they lowered the spf from 25 to 20
though it does at least absorb quickly
it does absorb quickly however and smells fine.
it was like a light version of a regular soap.
i used this in my t-zone area as an extra oil blocker
apart from that it's fast absorbing
ed to nothing to enhancing the skin
the bottle partially deflated
making the packaging rather dysfunctional
have developed allergies to other br
it seemed to zap out any moisture as soon as it was absorbed
in terms of anti aging
it disappear in 3 uses
it felt heavy on my skin with a light application
i already have enlarged pores
it does absorb oils
it does not absorb quickly
help control my oil
didn't absorb into to skin
heavy on my skin
a lot less oil than normal was on the oil blotting sheet
doesn't spread out that well
still in search for a good oil control moisturizer
it doesn't spread evenly on your skin
this moisturizer absorbs really quickly
this did help with controlling the oil
this will strip the moisture out!
as well as their anti wrinkle day cream
this cleanser does the basic job
i normally use caudalie foam
completely stripped of natural oils
exacerbates my already problematic zones
it is not a deep penetrating moisturizer
my face shines immediately after applying it
regardless of how many oil-blotting papers i use
my face skin cannot absorb it at all
skin can absorb it quite well
absorbed by skin quickly
this product is lightweight
it also crumbles if i apply this
further research into the ingredients showed a level 4 comedogenic ingredient: ethylhexyl palmitate
not as concentrated as renergie lift.
the absorption is not 100%
also it did not absorb well .
it is supposed to be anti wrinkle
the cream instantly smoothes the lines
it tightened my lids
the eye lift is easy to use
my skin returned to its normal stage after 2 weeks of heavy exfoliation
i used some buffering cream
i did like the hygienic dispensing packaging though
the pump is very hygenic considering you're not contaminating the rest of the product
was anti aging as well
immediately associated it with that
i used ptr max complexion pads on a daily basis with never a sting
does not absorb well into the skin
should really rethink their packaging -- the lid is huge
my skin needed time to adjust
massaged with water as a cautionary practice
removes minimal makeup though
no worse than a basic $10 face cleansing gel
didn't remove my eye makeup as effectively as purell
i need something that prevents
depending on your skin
my big problem with the cleanser is the packaging
had to stop using it to avoid more breakouts
: continued daily use resulted in a small
stable number of zits around my mouth
it has a pump inside which keeps the rest of the product safe from germ contamination
it worked well on my acne-prone combination skin.
absorbs into the skin quickly
my skin does not absorb it
i struggle with acne as well
didn't provide my skin with sufficient moisture
i ordered this after extensive research on a new moisturizer
this is a lightweight moisturizer that goes on smoothly
that would help with wrinkles
i wanted to like this product as my skin typically responds well to benzoyl peroxide
gradually use more if need be
i still have tons of breakouts
loved the lightweight formula
if you apply a thin layer
take a long time to absorb
my pores are on the aging/larger side
don't need the extra illumination
it readily absorbs into the skin
the container's dispenser is great for those concerned about maintaining sanitary conditions
ton' to get a pre-measured amount of moisturizer to use
only contains 1oz of product
the formula is powerful enough that it kept my acne at bay
my skin absorb it quickly
i found my skin to be more oily than average by mid-day
my pores seem smaller
a dullness that comes with age
the title, "deep tissue repair" is pushing it.
expected a more moiturizing eye cream
it is a superior product
i layer it under nourish
im hoping its helping my newly aging skin
in addition, the pump is annoying.
after you depress it
not like oil heavy
the bottle also leaks a bit
it does soak in relatively quickly
does not actually impart moisture into it
which eventually clog my pores
i do feel it has a form of silica in it that makes it a functional primer for make-up
quickly gets into the skin
this product is loaded with fillers
silicone acts as a barrier
how are the other active ingredients in this going to penetrate into the skin?
i found breakouts occur
perhaps i will need to layer with other products to keep the moisture in
more effective cleansers out there for less $$
will clean face very well without striping all good natural occurring oils in your face
it easily removes all traces of makeup.
the scent is over powering
due to the strong scent it carries
it does draw out impurities from the pores.
i prefer an oil cleanser that removes everything in one wash to eliminate the need for a separate eye makeup remover
it removes makeup rather well
only need one pump to fully cleanse my face
it seems difficult to fully rinse this off your face
packaging is completely non-functional
the amore pacific oil free gel made my face tight
see if it provides more moisture
i used it alongside the enzyme peel
it has a light gel consistency
not concerned with anti-aging
additionally, the packaging is a little wonky.
daily renewal complex by murad is far superior
which can be damaging on a daily basis
dark spots really quickly
because of the excess oil production
i like that this product has high levels of vit c which are good for toning
wasteful the packaging is
can be beneficial to the skin
i used a thin layer of product and nothing.
neither for the pores.
hence my mixed feelings
this is one of the many blackhead clearing/pore refining products in my collection
i would recommend a clay mask if you want pore tightening effects
this coming from a new yorker
i've closely inspected my nose both before
it works great for minimizing pores
while the vacuum cleaner works okay over time/with continual use to minimize blackheads
t pore effect refining cream
the product comes in a cheap squeeze tube
it absorbs very quickly.
peptides are excellent for repairing damaged skin
i've used peptide products before with good results
sort of slippery serum that absorbs readily
in a product with this high a peptide content
it hard to control the dose.
its in the stabilized form
that it had a dropper to decrease the amount of oxygen getting into the bottle as much as possible
it is absorbed very quickly
does not deliver lifting / anti-wrinkle results
less wasteful to unscrew the cap
one squirt no matter how carefully done
shoots the contents all over
while pressing the pump with the other h
it seems to absorb well
i really wanted to like it because it has a high concentration of dmae in the amine form which is the one that supossely provides more lifting properties
is supposed to help maintain a youthful look
easily suffer from dryness if using the wrong products
for the duration of the week my skin's oil balance is maintained
it helps control the oil
the product itself is lightweight
needing to get a moisturizer quickly
it did not absorb into my skin
doesn't absorb that well into the skin
except for the breakouts
scents this strong are loaded with toxins, also.
it falls short of its promises
the consistency is light to the touch
the smell is a bit of a hurdle
have such an offensive odor
initially goes on nicely
seems to lessen the odor
smoothing the entire face
look younger and lose weight!
the smell is weakening my resolve with this trial
this product absorbs quickly
or something aquatic in this cream
a product that is unbearable to apply
it smells strongly of fish.
i believe that any product which has such a repelling smell that prevents me to use it
absorbed quickly into the skin
i switched to clinique moisture surge
it has spf as well
i normally use the moisture surge
which created more spots
it seemed to absorb well
i keep using it in hopes my skin will adjust
am stcking with spot corrector only
what i like about it is how quickly my skin absorbs it
this eye cream doesn't help improving the condition
switching over to rénergie lift multi-action eye
does not blend well with make up
i liked its light weight
in all seriousness its a great cleanser
i normally like fab products
i prefer something more deep cleansing
the product is ineffective
because it fails to cleanse my face property
it smells strongly like medicine
the roller dispenses too much product
the product itself stings
it dispenses too much liquid
it takes too long to absorb into the skin.
as the patch has developed
some help with dark circles
it also does not absorb quickly at all
since the product description states it helps dark circles
this does not absorb into my skin whatsoever
i break out easily
no matter if i apply a thin layer or a thick one
a bit on the stickier side for my preference
it just won't absorb into my skin no matter what toner/mask/cleaning solution i use
in order to achieve its desired effect
it feels kind of heavy
which is one of my redness triggers
it does minimize the redness
it also worsens the oily nose look as the day progresses
it does minimize the redness some
i would recommend more for burning skin that needs to be cooled off
absorbs quickly which i like
good, clean pump dispenser.
this does not relieve redness at all
i can easily find a h
it reduces redness when i put it on
or some other ingredient that my skin reacts to in the first aid beauty line
many products sting my face
i like this product because of the simple ingredients
glass packaging is spot on though
it drips down so fast
essential for the contents
is about as effective as water
acne-prone because of those two factors
i don't use oil to primarily remove make up
also the pump leaks
not good for contact lens
the viscosity needs to be increased
because it's water-resistant the instructions recommend an oil-based cleanser with it
the shiseido also does not emulsify as well as shu
it removed my makeup well
i love the fact that it absorbs quickly
the oiliness returns very quickly
it does absorb nicely when applied
based on the claims that it is good for oily
the search continues to decrease shine
by 10am blotting papers are a must
it does absorb some of the oil
if not stirred on a regular basis will become chunky
does not absorb well at all.
i quickly began rinsing
5 ounces that is usual
it didn't absorb quickly
it also didn't remove my makeup as effectively as it advertises
adds an extra step to cleansing
even after multiple washes.
my overall skin texture has been improving dramatically from using this product in combination with the detoxifying black cleanser
the face feels artificially oily
like the cooling effect
it removes makeup well
it still manages to make my makeup adhere to my skin
as well as setting sprays
which led to my skin producing more oils to compensate
reactive skin could tolerate it
the grim facts are
with all thoseamazing neuropeptides,etc.
lines are slowly smoothing.
it also feels as though my face is overcompensating for the lack of moisture by producing more oil
the product didn't absorb into my skin.
lightweight, and i'll keep saying it.
everybody's skin reacts differently on different ingredients
my acne spread everywhere
it did give me a great experience because of its fast absorb rate
i found that my pore size somewhat growth
securely clicks between the open
it failed to hydrate as promised.
for dark circles that are genetic like mine
i've heard of different "quick fixes"
a lack of sleep exacerbates them
i like the rollerball because it lends a cooling effect
however the roller has its drawback.
does provide a good amount of moisture
it was neither cooling nor refreshing
the product doesn't dispense evenly
as for dark circles
i think this rollerball does a good job at increasing circulation
it absorbs nicely and works well under makeup.
it is definitely "corrective
" producing a smooth skin surface that de-emphasizes lines
contains nothing to correct your skin
this serum goes on smoothly
i used this along with the shiseido bio performance super restoring cream
i do like the super restoring cream
as an anti-aging product junkie
the effects are non-existent
cannot stress how strong the smell is
it didn't absorb well
guard against environmental damage to the skin
it goes on smoothly
concealer applies over the top of it with only minimal creasing
it absorbs quickly and moisturizes effectively.
easier to get out with the included plastic stick
an average eye-cream for me.
cannot comment on the removal of under eye dark circles
it smooths the skin under my eyes
it did not absorb well
it goes on smoothly
targets toxins in the heart of the cell
metropolitan life with lots of pollution
bit by bit the lid stopped functioning as a lid
since the creme costs $100 a pot
because cold plasma eye is expensive
i expected to like the eye cream as well
it feels lightweight compared to the face cream
the plasma eye smells worse than the plasma face
it also doesn't seem to absorb well when used in conjunction with a serum
i agree that it absorbs quickly
the cold plasma face as well
total waste of money - unusable.
formula needs to be updated to be more wearable on the daily
this moisturizer falls flat
makeup apples well over it
mixing in a little bit of too faced anti-shine primer helped
happens that this product contains a fairly high amount of balsam resin
which is a well know irritant
once it soaks in
i went through the product fairly quickly.
the 5 in 1 face cream spf 30 did not absorb into my skin
i loved it the first day its light absorbs quickly
this neither cleans nor clears.
wanted clay for a deeper cleanse
my biggest skin problem is excess sebum.
that is if you pre-cleanse!
effective at getting rid of acne
it helps control my oils throughout the day
even though it was natural
the product does not spread
texture or prevent breakouts
a sephora consultant recommended this to help 'bring out all of those impurities from my skin over time
the smoothness when putting on
it did slightly minimize my pores
it also adds an extra layer of grease to my face
fully dried in about 30 minutes
it also has a strange chemically/elementary school smell
extract them with my tool
it doesn't minimize the appearance of pores
i used a nice even thick layer as stated for directions
to be honest normal drug store nose strips work better
i tried this because of the excitement of social media on the charcoal masks
this won't help you with pores or clarifying.
it does not remove any impurities
you have to apply thick layers to get this to work properly
so the amount of uses you get out of this is minimal
heavy for a daytime product
the thick consistency made it harder to spread evenly on my face
i typically love her products
the cream is heavily concentrated
i would also suggest trying murad essential-c day moisture broad spectrum spf 30 pa+++
good for a heavier winter creme.
the jar style is a breeding ground for bacteria
does not absorb into the skin easily
blended into skin easily
called clinique who suggested removing the dropper
only the laser focus to my face
this product does tighten skin tone
it glides on just as smooth
absorbs right into your skin
it doesn't get to absorb into the skin very well
smoothing would be better for this delicate skin
it did not absorb
well, those pimples spread.
however it takes forever to absorb
it absorbed super fast
it does seem to hydrate adequately
when mixed with water
not ideal for removing eye makeup
a less expensive alternative to shu uemura's cleansing oil

if any water touches it
mixing it with my foundation
it really erases lines
not impossible if thinly spread then cream moisturizer bad with oil

it's also like a clay-based mask in the sense that it provides that firm/tight effect
which is that any moisture you put on top of it will essentially dissolve the product
using it as a mask
a lighter application with minumal results
it smooths out lines
when you apply this product it tightens your face
upon application it tightened the skin almost immediately
i'll stick with clarins instant smooth

while this product certainly transforms your entire eye area
t does improve the under eye surface area
it adds to lines under your eyes
this is the only treatment that removes my under eye bags instantly
sephora gets 10 stars for their easy returns
the cons outweigh the pros
makeup underneath makes it less effective
although this product does firm under the eyes it leaves a white film

this is an effective product if you tap it on your pores
i found rubbing in to skin too vigorously makes it not effective
did needed something to minimize my pores for summer
it would make my skin look seamless
this product has an odor compared to stale cigarettes
its always my go to primer for enlarged pores or acne scarring minimizing
the consistency of the product is now thinner
which in turn makes it like all the pore minimizing products out there i have tried
my pores are often giant
it doesnt really minimize my pores
liked the consistency,because its lightweight.
after many different primers/ pore minimizers
not as effective as other available pore minimizing products in changing appearance
fails to truly transform into a rich milk with water
doesn't give any boost of amazing hydration except for a greasy outer-layer on the skin
skips instead of gliding on effortlessly like an oil cleanser should
i do prefer a higher quality clean feeling in a cleanser
causes the oil to get onto the bottle
this stuff easily removed foundation
get something more effective at makeup removal
this was effective enough for cleansing my face
it works great at removing all makeup compared to other oil cleansers
i still need to use a separate eye makeup remover
it is easier to massage

dissolves your makeup quickly
instead of being a traditional cleansing oil
i normally love all differ types of smells for makeups
this provides lightweight moisture at best

it would never absorb into my skin
it seems to be mostly thickeners
it is thick but it absorbs quickly.
i could not even use the cream after i squeezed some out of a sample vacuum pouch because the smell was so strong

which thankfully fades fairly quickly.

i am desperately searching for an effective eye cream that reduces dark circles
the product promises to help with dark circles
it absorbs quickly enough
kept smoothing it in
i gave 2 stars for one reason: it hydrates well
as everyone's skin reacts differently to products
i prefer an eye cream that has intensive anti-aging results

all the products are natural
this eye crème migrates
it tends to migrate into the eye
this cream does have thick consistency as the descriptions states
lines are starting to lessen
does not absorb into the skin easily
i couldn't stop my eyes from continuously watering
doesn't have as high a level of sun protection
need an eye cream with extra protection
with the unneeded spf
it stings when applied
it does not absorb
which makes it difficult to apply evenly
it has the potential to clog pores
did not find it to be effective although the cream is thick upon application
in need of additional hydration
it degrades much faster
difficult to spread around the eye area without stretching or pulling the delicate skin
algenist's complete eye renewal balm
i also need something extra in my eye cream: brightens my dark circles or helps with puffiness

this comes in jar packaging
when the product is exposed to light

it should be in more stable packaging
it sits on top and doesn't penetrate the skin.
skin irritants are known to accelerate the aging process
this comes in jar packaging
on a nonallergic related note this also does not absorb well at all
it provided some hydration
a cast member directed me to this product to help diminish dark spots without the risk of hydroquinone
putting a product with hydroquinone all over the face would lighten my entire face as opposed to the areas i needed
perhaps the most ineffective product from ptr
the murad rapid age spot treatment might be a better choice if you are using this product for hyperpigmentation
it does remove your makeup nicely
this cleanse balm is too heavy for me.
additional tools to work properly
i overlooked the word "balm"
i want it thoroughly cleansed
washed away more cleanly
it doesn't cleanse nor does it have "thermal" effects
its impossible to wash off
it didn't even heat up at all as the name "thermal balm" would suggest
$30 price range that i found more effective with make-up removal
nothing removes makeup better
caused my combo skin to be oilier than usual
or is that specifically copper peptide?
i also like the fact that the product has algae in it
it does not absorb
my pores look enlarged in the morning after using it
a tiny bit covers evenly
it feels sticky and cannot be absorbed.
it dries very quickly
but it does not fully absorb and feels sticky.
large amounts of alcohol in products can cause dryness
the intense fragrance started triggering migraines
beneficial for my skin
no breakouts while using this product
it doesn't heal my acne scars any faster than normal
bought moisture surge instead
this product does absorb quickly
i like zero gravity cream better.
it wasn't fast absorbing at all
i found this to be a really ineffective makeup remover
ran out of micellar water
effective at removing makeup
easily irritated or breakout prone skin
the pump made saturating cotton pads super easy
i recommend sephora collection's other micellar waters
works like other micellar waters
this cleansing water is not cut out for removing makeup
it does take a while to absorb
it goes on smooth
i may stick to this when i'm wearing very low key or no makeup since the radiance helps with the darkness under my eyes
despite being formulated for morning use
absorb nicely in the eye area
the ginzing moisturizer in contrast absorbs much more quickly
normal sometimes combo skin
it does foam up well
it does clean well
the rest is healing quickly
sticking to simple drug store skin care
introducing them or substituting them into my skin care routine
still had to use a separate eye makeup remover
cuts the healing time in half
had high hopes that this would help calm that
with algae at a higher price
even though it boasts "age-erasing"
i am sticking with their ginzing energy-boosting moisturizer
it focused on age prevention
it goes on smoothly
absorb into my skin quickly
i like to apply a thicker
it's quick thick and smooths on nicely.
i would only use it on the outer part of my face
going back to my shiseido bio performance revitalizing cream
it removes makeup well
i also need to use an exfoliate cleanser once a week to get a deeper clean
it fully cleaned my face
i recommend the rose clay mask from origins
typically with charcoal masks
doesn't correlate with its effectiveness
pores are my main concern
i love activated charcoal
i've used charcoal activated products before
good mask for tightening
it applies thin on the skin
it doesn't help with creasing in the under-eye area
low and behold it was this product.
it also works well under makeup
besides providing a slightly smoother surface for concealer
it is heavy, does not absorb easily.
absorbs easily into the eye area
the cream absorbs well
the only plus is that it is fast absorbing.
it helps with oil
it definitely helped cleanse my face
this is overdrying my skin especially after paring it with my clarisonic
pores were the same
it also enlarges my pores
it is effective against my adult acne
cons: salicylic acid only treats certain kinds of breakouts
the zero oil deep pore cleanser from origins is great
as far as helping reduce my breakouts
it'll spread over your entire face
my skin is combination type
how it works on skin
i prefer the origins overnight intensive mask in the green tube
i tissued off the excess one time
it gives you very minimal hydration.
i compared how much oil was on my blotting paper
it goes on easily
definitely helps reduce shine
this product goes on smooth
heavy feeling on my skin after application
fairly slow rate of absorption
typically use a moisturizer with clarifying properties
i found that this product makes my skin purge
it is a light gel texture that absorbs easily
it was from stress
sometimes with small pumps
affordable clay mask aside from this
would only recommend if you need something to reduce the redness quickly
i much prefer origins active charcoal mask
true active charcoal one
love how light weight it is
i felt like it absorbed
did not absorb well
i like gel moisturizers because they absorb quickly
it has a cooling effect
made it feel sort of elastic
applying foundation seems to go on smooth
the gel was not spread through
if your skin is normal
i topped it off with the urban decay powder
to decrease the size of my pores
it definitely has a cooling effect
pore refinement etc etc
it is super light-weight
not for minimizing the look of pores
adjust to the new product
it has not helped diminish fine lines i'm starting to develop
this one seems thin
nothing special for normal skin.
light texture and dries quickly.
could be that the retinol substitute was too strong
since it is called an anti-aging eye treatment
think this product may contains much silica in it
such as fading the dark spots in my skin
unlike previous containers over the years the newer container is opaque
breaks out more easily
also give yourself about 5-10 min for the product to absorb before putting on a primer or foundation
i usually use the moisture surge
it does not absorb quickly or entirely.
but it just does not absorb thoroughly.
it took a long time to absorb into the skin
didn't blend well into the face
i love clinque's other moisture surge thirst relief
it doesn't absorb into the skin.
rather an "industrial" like strong smell
i am a huge fan of ciinique's moisture surge gel
it is a bit heavy
the serum goes on smoothly
flimsy for a higher end product
the wrinkle revenge eye balm from an aggressive dermadoctor saleswoman
it goes on easily
no lifting, no nourishment.
the high rating comes from
will provide a level of firmness
i will continue to use on the lid
don't firm the skin as well
as soon as it dries out
because the product went on smoothly
while it does provide temporary lifting after a very short time the lifting effect entirely disappears
this product is not useful to someone with aging eyelids
absorbs into the skin easily
it did absorb quickly with no residue.
including helping to fade acne spots
i tried combining with a scrub from another br
the formula is so thick that the pump starts clogging up
the product itself is black
i'd use this "cleanser" to increase the size/amount of pores
the bottle claims that it also reduces pores
it doesnt reduce your pores
my pores still the same
despite mutliple efforts of cleaning the components
or excess spills out while i'm pouring
its reputed abilities to transform adult acne prone skin
for example argon oil
wrinkle depth or repair
even after applying generously
no lifting or firming.
the product feels light
help with reducing lines?
presumably from the hefty dose of hydration
preferring the lower contamination/oxidation risk of a pump
gave it 3 stars because it absorbs quickly
no lifting or firming in upper lids
it does absorb easily
could use some help with puffiness
it does absorb well
it is not an instant depuffing eye gel.
the gel formula absorbs quickly into skin
doesn't interfere with eye makeup
light for under makeup
and it does nothing to minimize my pores.
my skin is normal
it emphasizes the texture of your pores
it also doesn't absorb like normal moisturizers.
also clogged my pores like no other
the skin care specialist at spear recommended this product for my combination skin
i switched to a different korres primer
use the brightening nighttime mask for at night
the extra repair oil
it starts to peel / pillage
fine bumps on the areas i applied this product
i don't like the heavy rose scent in this product
effects take a while to take affect
errors in attempts to correct my skin problem
i usually apply a layer
which means it attracts water
if strong smells trigger your headaches
it doesn't absorb into my skin
will lead to a lot of waste
this takes off makeup well
used as a first cleanse at night to remove makeup
turns into an oil
it has a strong gel
it removes make-up decently
unlike the cleaning oil i use
doesn't efficiently remove makeup
pre-cleanse to remove make up
it's such a long process for removing makeup.
the new formulation does not completely remove eye makeup
it was very liquidly immediately after applying
for the steep price tag
this product contains lavender which aggravates skin
i tried spraying directly on my face per the instructions
requiring fast fingers to spread
which must be the propellant
the label says it evaporates when expelled
dissipates before contact with the skin
the dispenser sticks also.
like with the deep tissue repair
the fast acting one as well
have been using deep moisture therapy for a week now
not heavy once absorbed.
the product works well
didn't absorb as fast as i'd have liked
it also smells like low tide.
having this level of bad odor in a product is unnecessary
the end result is a cream that smells pleasing due to these processes
the sales person recommended this cream instead of a lip-specialized product
it didn't fully absorb
lightweight on my skin
it is quick absorbing
it didn't absorb well into my skin at all
and it lingers for a while.
this claims to be a brightening product
it feels like it takes a while to absorb into my skin though
it does absorb quickly
it is lightweight and skin absorbs quickly.
my skin broke out almost instantaneously.
as it is "all natural"
the smell dissipates after about 5 minutes
for being so light-weight
i exchanged it for the sheer transformation
it also absorbed very quickly into my skin.
pulse points instead of my temples
when i applied this product onto my skin
it seems to help with my moderate acne
thus the three stars
it's oil control abilities
it keeps giving me congestion
part stays on the surface providing glide
felt like the product did not absorb into skin
the clinque gel works better
inevitably there is a fair amount of makeup on my cotton ball when i use toner after cleansing
you have to blend a lot to get it to disappear into the skin
dimished any spots or prevented spots from forming
also the product doesn't stay stationary in the stick
does have a cooling effect for the under eye
looses its coolness after that
the cooling effect was inconsistent
then there were the various degrees of cooling in between
i liked the cooling effect.
it works, improves puffiness up to 80% for me
so even if the product builds up potency over time
t's extra cooling in the morning
definitely gives a cooling effect
the packaging seems convenient
shrank in the tube
the product itself does a decent job of alleviating puffiness
the balm itself is also only about 2 centimeters tall
one "wrinkle" under each eye
it did have a cooling sensation
wears well under makeup
had to go to other products for firming /anti-wrinkle affects
for those with normal or combination skin
i also needed it to help with puffiness
did not absorb well
i applied a very thin layer
and i do love the fact that it is magnesium rich!
i got better results with just bentonite clay which is just a few dollars
creating an oil slick
it creates a situation where i either have to contaminate the remaining product
it wouldn't absorb into the skin at all
get acne marks easily
after applying this formula
s helps with dryness
this didn't absorb well
you can still detect it
it dissipates after about 5 minutes or so
this oil sits on my face for quite a while before fully absorbing
which doesn't protect the integrity of the oils
didn't absorb into my skin
it is like a top layer on the skin
the feeling on the skin is heavy.
the price is steep
if it delivers on its promises
rotated with the night oil
i powered through it
it says it helps with pores
concealer on it loses its apparent effectiveness
it leaks out of the tube too fast
not for combination or normal skin
it says pore-perfecting
still feels like a minimal clean
or breakouts at all
i don't love the inclusion of essential oils for the scent
i would warn anyone with reactive skin against this product
i would recommend murad perfecting lotions for a lower priced product with much more punch
greasiness would lead to breakouts again
hundreds of tiny bumps everywhere!
shouldn't it be in a pump instead of a dropper to reduce air exposure?
it takes a little while to absorb
it's an oil but does gradually aborb.
however great the idea of naturally derived
its derivatives has underlined the importance of opaque packaging so the clear
it would minimize the wrinkles a bit on application
this is a deep wrinkle minimized which did
minimize any of my wrinkles
the discontinuation of sephora's instant wrinkle filler
it is impossible to blend foundation over this product
i needed it for makeup priming
it does smooth the look of the wrinkle instantly though
i wanted a daily serum to eventually reduce the wrinkles not just cover them
i've applied this cream diligently
i think the product is more akin to primers that "fill" wrinkles for the application of make-up
meaning i think this product stiffens the fragile skin
the effect is zero
i realize that deep wrinkles are hard to address
it appears reduce eye bags for 6-8 hrs.
i struggle with various forms of acne
i like that it sinks in
have acne it is equivalent to using water as a spot treatment
about the product being thin
the design of the tube causing the product to leak out
it can create little cracks in the surface which bacteria can get trapped in
i do struggle with breakouts
seem to provide a sufficient amount of hydration
has a mattifying affect which doesn't keep my oil at bay throughout the day
it does create a smooth canvas to apply makeup
it may be the salicylic acid that my skin isn't responding well to
it seems to prevent breakouts
i need to take care of it meticulously in order to avoid blemishes because it is sensitive
it does help clear up breakouts.
the formula should packaged more in a pump
the dispensing tube i find to be problematic.
if the dispensing tube were more like the dispensing tube of the former "on a clear day"
it also didn't help with the active pimples
the product sinks in quickly
was it taking all the impurities out?
the product itself feels cooling as you put it on
i also think it doesn't absorb as well as some of my preferred face lotions
my skin is tight within minutes of application.
it absorbs right into your skin
unlike the under eye gel mask i have been using
i reused it a second time
it can be reused
i'd say, the mask material is sturdy.
the overall refreshing feel of the hydrogel material
after removing the mask
exaggerates the flaws on my skin
i've used everything to control my adult acne
takes a while for the stickiness to go away
heavy for my skin
it did not absorb as quickly as some of other products i have tried
even using it as a night cream helps add some needed moisture without clogging my hypersensitive skin
feels matte on skin but oil continues to build.
i go through the tubes fast
while it glides on well
it helped some of my breakouts heal faster
as a face oil however
it did soften my skin
no volume or body
it prevents my skin from drying out
it absorbs quickly and mattifys my face.
while i love that it controls the oil
i am cautious with moisturizers since they tend to clog my pores
also doesn't keep the oil under control
this fluid is "non-acnegenic"
it takes a while to vanish
cleansing properly as well
can congest your pores
it did not absorb
it doesn't absorb very easily
use many other rich moisturizers without breaking out
for those with normal skin
its a tad greasy hence the thinness of the product
given that this is marketed as a dark circle corrector
doesn't conceal well at all
as the formula dries down it begins to sting
also helps concealer go on smoothly
blends into the skin nicely without being greasy or affecting the appearance of makeup
made applying concealer go on much more smoothly
i love their even better clinical corrector
the cream itself is light
i love the cooling sensation the applicator gives onto my under eyes
it is very light weight and quick to absorb.
when the supply was depleted
it goes on smoothly
the cream does not absorb well into skin.
this product primarily works on the outer edges on the eye
sometimes even accentuates the dark circles further
t will reduce some puffiness
as well as after stopping use
may coop raw essence
did not absorb into my skin at all.
much less explosive breakouts that cover an entire area of my face
when i paired it with the alpha beta peel pads it made such a difference
this made my skin develop bumps wherever i applied it
it absorbs very quickly to the skin
it is a lightweight oil that will leave a grease film on your skin not allowing it to breathe
need to start balancing an acne prone t zone
the dropper on the bottle decides to loosen
$85 down the drain because of a malfunction in the dropper
helps with fine lines
it causes more breakouts
t overnight resurfacing serum as it helps with breakouts so much better than this product does
it worked great by making my pores smaller
as a mask or a spot treatment
it is definitely helping reduce the amount of oiliness on my face overall though out the day
it has help my skin as far as a breakouts in certains spots
it works as a dispenser
the directions called for a thick layer in affected areas
effectively dries out my breakouts
then as a thin primer treatment under make up
with less healing time
as well as intermittent bouts of acne
spread your bacteria into the product
while simultaneously giving my acne of a kind
i gave it 3 stars because when you apply a thin layer like the directions say to absorb oil
stripped it of moisture which actually lead to more breakouts
this is on the heavy side
it's heavy in the jar, but it absorbs quickly.
my sensitive dry skin seems to absorb it readily
the skin does seem to absorb readily
my skin looks smooth and firm after i apply it.
i much prefer shiseido's bio-performance advanced super revitalizing cream
the product leaked all over my counter
required a moisturizer to follow immediately
the stickiness of it on my face
none from an anti-aging perspective
slick marketing versus solid science
initially it provided a little hydration
does not brighten instantly as it claims
switched to a regular eye cream from clinique
i combine it with another eye cream.
even though i only apply on the lower lid
it made it difficult to put on concealed.
it says not to use it on upper lid
how much i blended it into my skin
this cream did not absorb well
does make concealer easier to smooth on
on the plus side it does hydrate well
reduced the fine lines i have as well
it interacts well with my other skin care products
the gel-like texture was absorbed into my skin quickly
i'll stick with the ultra repair cream.
it does absorb quickly
goes on well, non-irriating.
and it's lightweight and quick-absorbing.
does not absorb well
does not absorb quickly, not intensive.
yes, this product does absorb fast.
there are also 2 other ingredients that are pore clogging
almost gel in consistency
takes forever to absorb into the skin
this product only softens the skin
after about month the auto pump stopped delivering a full dose of product
the pump mechanism stinks
the pump lid is not user friendly
this moisturizer measures up as average product with high cost
the built in pump dispenser is annoying because it causes the product to waste
it doesn't absorb well
my skin is normal
tried both the intense treatment with the pore minimizer
enlarged pores are in my genetics
control oil as the perricone md line has a lot of beneficial ingredients
it also didn't absorb well on my skin.
i followed the application technique
nor does it seem to unclog the pores at all.
in my quest for a truly pore minimizing
i carefully review every ingredient of everything that goes on my skin
this has at least 3 super pore clogging ingredients
find it helps to soothe my skin
i tried adding water to it to soften it
this mask is an effective
although it contains clay
while i have normal skin
it include the glamglow super mud clearing treatment
second, the applicator is a big fail.
did not absorb into the skin well
applicator deposits too much product
since it didn't absorb well at all
it prohibited my eye cream from absorbing as well
the applicator was designed by some crazy person who has no idea how applicators should work: easy
it took forever to absorb as well.
takes a little time to absorb
eye cream and slowly lines are disappearing.???
i find the applicator deposits way too much product
as i tissue away excess.
it sits well underneath makeup
minimized lines as it promises
which ultimately translated to "sweaty"
high 90s- low 100s
pricey, so use sparingly.
sk-ii is easy to use with a convenient pump.
as i only use minimal makeup
it does dissolve makeup
which by the way is an stick/spatula to use while applying said product
rose gold with an included spatula
a place that spatula can be stored
offers premium moisture benefits
it takes so long to absorb into the skin i can only use it as a night time cream
the non-stop indoor air conditioning
it goes on lightly and smoothly.
if it causes increased sun sensitivity
the bottle is heavy
the pump works nicely
it made it easy to spread on my face
it glides over the skin smoothly
the product's packaging hides the amount of actual cream inside
the pump will cease to produce any more fluid
the dispensing top is genius
since the treatment essence
dense it was actually suffocating
this product absorbs well into the skin
it also makes my eyes heavy
goes on very smoothly
it does absorb into skin really well though.
petroleum can migrate into your eyes
these dried up chunks of product make it more difficult to apply
feels heavy while it's setting/absorbing
though it did absorb quickly
it does absorb quickly
love the natural element
i am transitioning this to an intensive moisturizer to the back of my h
love this for the nighttime
which was non greasy
this lotion absorbs quickly
get rid of the original "make a difference" moisturizer
use it as a primer
it did not reduce the appearance of pores.
nothing has reduced excess oil on my face like this
it also dries fast
it was non-greasy
it takes a while to absorb
it did not absorb into my skin
super hard for skin to absorb.
as for the anti-ageing
it does not absorb
i didnt feel like it absorbed into my skin correctly
usually acne prone skin that is on the normal side
rate the product higher
see some of my lines soften
can make you more susceptible to wrinkles
it does smooth the eye area
i kept it away from direct sunlight
love the pump, love the gel consistency.
despite its description as non-irritating
is easily absorbed by the skin
it will sting a lot
it goes on smooth
this goes on smooth
e to breakouts/congestion under the surface
avoid areas with active acne/breakouts
would not absorb into the skin at all
t absorbed into my skin
at the same time i was using my sirius aurora light therapy system which also gets rid of scarring
it doesn't blend well into the skin
the lotion is light and absorbs quickly.
it seems to do a fair job of minimizing wrinkles
its very harsh for daily usage
the product helped me a lot with reducing oil
while it did absorb quickly
pores are smaller in appearance
i need to use an additional moisturizer after this one settles in order for my makeup to go on smoothly
it immediately felt cooling
it did absorb quickly
it is mostly managed by topical rx
my skin didn't absorb it well.
it goes on smoothly
it absorbs really fast
pores are the same
this moisturizer absorbs quickly just like it says
which is known to combat oil
i love how light weight this product goes on
how lightweight it is
my pores are the same
except for this pore corrector
was hoping to tighten pores.
it does not minimize the appearance of my large pores
really shrink my pores after 2 pregnancies
it does not help with shrinking my pores.
the multi-perfecting pore corrector
my main concerns are my undereye bags
the serum goes on nicely light weighted
it improves fine lines
i would wait for it to absorb
is immediately effective at brightening up my under eye area
have even done intense chemical peels
it seams to be very basic everyday shelf eye cream
mainly in the hydration
as for reducing dark under-eyed circles
gives a sort of brightening effect
i loved the texture of this as it smooths out the eye area beautifully making a good surface for make-up application
look into other under eye treatments
even reordered this with the oil
i find other facial oils far more beneficial for my complexion
feels smooth while quickly absorbing
this product effectively hydrates the under-eye/orbital zone on your face
since it does not absorb much into the skin
've switched to josie's argan oil light
the oil separates from the cream very easily
the texture of this oil prevents this issue
better try the original josie maran argan oil.
instead it feels like neosporin with some oil mixed in
applied overtop a moisturizer it gives extra nourishment
my acne is non existent
2 stars only because it is 90% natural
it does absorb easily
it does not absorb into my skin well
it feels more like a heavy moisturizer as opposed to a true mask
it absorbs nicely onto skin
is attached by screws at the rear
use it frequently in my moisturizer rotation
as with other laser products
it goes on rich
it doesn't absorb all the way.
did not see any improvements in "smooths lines while plumping"
it provides average moisture
the regular moisture surge
after 20 nights of continuous application i'm giving up on this product
minus the ultra moisture cream i normally use
each pod can easily be two masks
the wei mask really didn't help unclog them at all
combined with my allergies
it does 't absorb the excess oils in my skin.
not enough moisture retention.
it hasn't crazily improved my skin
absorbs fast, smells like jasmin.
while this produce was lightweight
as it does cause irritation
provided a moderate amount of moisture
it doesn't absorb into skin
it causes severe product balls with my primer
it also absorbs in so quickly.
it does absorb quickly
this product did not absorb well into my skin
the texture also of the cream was divided.
squeeze the product together
very light and absorbs quickly.
coli should be in a contained science lab
it leaves something to be desired
how lightweight it is
i really like it absorb instantly
my acne grows more
then i realized it never lets any liquid or mineral foundation set
it did not absorb well at all
i made it a priority to cleanse
i switched to a different oil
i don't have a clinical explication why this oil led to no breakouts on my face
performs the same as cheaper oils
it truly helps dissolve my oil
the dropper/lid design needs to be revamped
add in another nourishing carrier
this product has lavender oil which if used frequently on the skin over time gives you wrinkles
it does provide serious hydration
i mixed it with my day cream
makeup glides seamlessly with it under
wipe the residual oil off my face
mixed with my foundation
i developed acne breakouts along both sides of my face
makeup does not go on smoothly over it
the stickiness lasted all day
was impossible to deal with when applying powder foundations
it more masked on top of my skin rather than absorbing
i find the stickiness
nor do i find that the texture provides a cooling effect
also it's not that fast absorbing.
i think because it is partially a gel
opt for a more intense moisture cream
i love fresh products overall.
so well after two washes
normally i like fresh products
it does take more than 1 pump to cleanse your face
this wash cleanses well
how quickly the foam disappears
the scent of rose in general
at the cost of this foam
the rose foam doesn't
does not absorb into the skin
even after the oil soaks in
the scent also embeds itself in the skin
it feels like none of it is absorbed into my skin
as it absorbs that goes away
it kind of adds to my general repulsion
absorbs fairly quickly compared to other oils
it turns my face into an oil slick while not managing to penetrate for deeper moisturizing
i used his nurture me makeups
the orange color plays havoc with any fabric it gets onto
this is my 4th bottle of the activating oil
even after it is absorbed
it would correct the dryness
it dissipated faster than the smell.
it also causes some minor irritation when you use it daily on sensitive skin
the lack of absorbency then by all means buy this
trying to take preventative measures
i don't find it absorbing quickly.
it creates more dryness
this product does provide a firming result with prolonged use
it does not absorb quickly
interferes with my make up
the irritations ceased as soon as i switched creams
i did apply to upper lid
doesn't absorb well at all
i also alternate a moisturizer
pore minimizer on a daily basis
i do feel it smooths out my face
the smell is gross
the color tended to accumulate in brown streaks -- using less reduced this
the product is exposed to air every time you use it
ing exposure to air causes products like this to decrease in efficacy
it goes way to quickly
giving it only 3 stars because i need to prevent aging of my skin
large pores around my t zone area
of large pores is so minimal with this product that it is not worth the time it takes to apply another layer before makeup
primer goes on nicely
it creates a smooth base for foundation application
as all primers should
that is a far cry from the "visibly refine pores" this product claims
blurring from other primers
spreads easily and absorbs nicely.
but skin becomes smooth.
i tried it for the anti aging properties
the triple acid mask
the pore corrector primer was not for me.
it had a tendency to pill off when applying foundation
hoped to add this primer to my daily routine
it goes on smoothly
have found a regimen that works for me to effectively combat shine
it absorbs into my skin quick
i followed it with the matching cream- not enough moisture
was no longer marketed for"oily
i prefer clinique moisture surge.
i've found the source of my skin woes
i figured it was something your skin had to adjust to like retinol
denatured alcohol is the sixth ingredient listed
denatured alcohol causes free-radical damage in skin even at low levels
this oily does not get absorbed quickly
my now-existing acne began to heal
the face oil did slightly lessen the production of oils throughout the day
with the severity of the breakouts
i'd use 1-2 extra drops of this oil
this enlarged my pores
the oil goes on light
did not absorb well into my skin
used just as said with the toner still on
then look at the ingredients in this "advanced" restoring cream on sephora
which is a stabilizing oil that helps preserve antioxidants
the consistency is rather thick
that it provides spf
like the fact that its lightweight
had an effective spf
it does absorb quickly
evens out the skin
there are some really great positives to it: it uses titanium dioxide instead of chemical spfs
it the beginning i thought this stickiness will absorb into my skin
causing massive clogging of my pores
it does absorb quickly
spreads into a lightweight layer
i find it a little hard to evenly spread my foundation after using this moisturizer
the packaging is airtight when it needs to be
lots of ingredients deteriorate if not in the proper packaging
erasing marks or reducing acne
after it dries its invisible
the alcohol content makes this a bit drying
i gave 2 stars because the tube isn't durable
when applied very thinly
does create a tightening sensation
the upper lid gel was not noticeably effective
as far as the amazing claims of improved collagen or elasticity?
especially on the upper lid
it gives a feeling of tightness.
didn't absorb very quickly
it is simply a blend of oils
for a company which promotes eco-friendliness
in my quest to find more natural products for my body
along with this specific moisturizer
the replenishing nutrient complex
using nightly after cleansing
natural things take time
the gel like consistency sort of dries/hardens on my skin after 15-20 mins where it becomes tight
it also has a strong smell from the essential oils
pregnancy hormones are likely the culprit
however, it is lightweight and absorbs quickly.
it provided no protective barrier for my skin
for a company which promotes eco-friendliness
moreover, the product does not absorb at all.
i realize this is a natural product
everything promises smaller pores
the only way to use it is to unscrew it
how it leaves a refresh
the pump clogs up
sprint the $$for this cleanse
love that the product is natural.
the glass jar is super heavy
packaging is also rather wasteful given the natural angle of this line
after a few weeks the dispenser dispenses drops instead of squirts
it gets 2 stars for the natural ingredients
extensively research it for safety
the smelly process to attain it
putting these ingredients on skin is increasing the liklihood of an allergic reaction
it was wasteful because of its viscosity
illuminate under eye area
it caused acne instead.
it does not provide effective eye bag relief
while the rollerball felt cooling without irruption
i like the cooling affect
it is cooling on the eye
this is mostly because of the applicator
lets get this strait
even after being refrigerated
i normally use "modern" by origins
this product tends to make my skin produce more oil
really gives my skin a boost of moisture
my skin care consists of the clarisonic
adding this anti-aging oil was supposed to help
for an oil it is fast absorbing
it did absorb fairly quick
it is the algenist oil.
it does absorb it quite quickly
which also doesnt absorb well
or what anti-aging ingredients does it contain?
how it protects the integrity of the product
large pores on t-zone
which was expected as my skin was adjusting to the ingredients
i've tried dozens upon dozens of serums on my combination
it dries instantly when it hits your skin
the dropper disconnected from the cap
it feels very much like any of the primers loaded with silicon in it
made my skin temporarily smooth
most importantly it helps with my pores
i do notice that my pores look smaller upon application
that's something i've basically eliminated with constant cleansing
used all the necessary means to deeply cleanse
a better option for smooth skin is investing in a great toner
like the essence water that shiseido makes
in spite of it being a rather thick
it didnt absorve quickly at all
it is supposed to be light weight
it is not easy to be absorbed
usually i get breakouts when spf is mixed in
to combat this fast drying
the oil didn't absorb well
have to use multiple removers
it is quick absorbing
rather than reducing it
didn't absorb into the skin well
it did seem to blend in quickly though.
so much for anti aging.
large pores on t-zone
which was expected as my skin was adjusting to the ingredients
this does absorb quickly
large pores on t-zone
which was expected as my skin was adjusting to the ingredients
causing unbalancing of the skin
serves double duty for me
combo-oily skin reacted poorly with it
it absorbs quickly into the skin
while it helps with applying the products more smoothly the dropper has dissuaded me from buying it again
pushes out the liquid comes off
although i do like it for adding w my foundation to lessen the viscosity
this product was not fast absorbing.
heavy that i use it to remove eye makeup
very heavy cream that doesn't absorb quickly.
literally a cheap toner does a better job of removing dirt than this
this was my introduction to micellar water.
i love this product for the grape extract because it instantly plumps
it also evens out your skin
draws out excess dirt
as far as makeup removing
actually removes a lot of dirt.
feels like regular water
agreed with previous reviews that it leaves a sticky residue
get the simple micellar water instead!
not a heavy duty remover
it does remove non waterproof make up.
after applying product to face
so i had to use an oil based remover.
this works like every other micellar water i've tried
lower priced micellar waters
i've tried it over normal to heavy makeup
when i'm using 5 of my shiseido rounds i use primarily for my toner to finish the job it seems wasteful
its sole purpose is for freshen up
any residual eye makeup this would take care of beautifully
this does an average job of removing makeup.
which causes more wrinkles
because the ingredients were so minimal
this works to remove light makeup
this removes some makeup
a double-cleanse with a cleanser is more effective
simply using this to remove surface dirt
i usually use bioderma to remove my foundation
did do a formidable job removing my matte eyeshadow
it does not help with eye makeup removal at all
it used to be amazing in that it could cleanse
fresh masks are normally amazing.
for reference i'm combination skin with light oil in the tzone
pore clogging chemicals inevitably clogs up pores leading to breakouts
their skin care is harsh
most likely casused by the mineral oil
i also love the moisture surge.
i saw that one of the main ingredients is mineral oil
i cannot risk clogging my pores.
it did not absorb into my skin
it takes a long time to absorb into the skin
crows feet which are rapidly emerging
seems like there is no moisture functionality...
i tried this primarily to help with dark circles
help with dark circles
almost non existent crow's feet
doesn't layer well with other products
is it because my skin is immune to it
absorbs quickly, but the smell is really strong.
it also caused breakouts
i tried using matte foundation to counteract the shine
i also differ from pore visibility
almost a mix between a cream
however the formulation caused pilling on my skin
i struggle with pore visibility
this also claims to improve pores
doesn't refine anything about the surface
no refining at all
i felt like the product was poorly absorbed in my skin
the richer/thicker version of this product
l-carnitine was the key that would help
depending on the severity of your acne
my skin becomes crystal clear
the burn eventually disappears
unlike the extra strength alpha beta peels
the treatment is strong
using the pads quickly flatten
the product advertises clear skin within 10 days
these definitely produced a moderate burning sensation while using
after application the burning subsided quickly
this has little microbeads which i'm concerned about
much like the essence inside of a gel sheet mask
my first impressions of this serum was that it really absorbed very quickly
the difficulty of removing it
cleanse effectively that are much less harmful
the ingredient composition is disappointing
discovered it is derived from wool
as well as the smart little square of muslin cloth which cleanses well
a simple wipe with any of the other above products cleaned my face thoroughly
i found out that this has a lot of mineral oil in it
unlike natural plan oils
it comes from petroleum/crude oil which is a fossil fuel that has to be drilled out of the earth
would be "easier" to mix into a thicker "mask" consistency
over priced, smells, & doesn't spread well.
due to the amount of skin damaging alcohol which i don't underst
it seems to clean well without stripping
the cleansing power of this is less powerful than the regular one in a bowl
i mean its less powerful in removing the make up comparing to the normal eve lom cleansing balm
the pump is a bad setup.
once on the skin the scent disappears rather quickly
is smoother over all
may work better with a liquid foundation
stinging from the product
this does sting as well
i found it didn't absorb well
there is a learning curve to get this eye cream to work
also enjoy the smoothing effects even though it does take a few minutes to blend in the morning
tends to build up if not thoughtfully applied
it didn't absorb well.
doesn't absorb as quickly as i would like
it will absorb in well
this is sold as a dark spot corrector
much prefer skinceuticals pigment regulator.
after first applying this company's other newly touted serum
i don't normally breakout in spurts
i like that the pump provides a measured amount
intended for medium skin tones
it absorbed into my skin quickly
my makeup goes on smoothly
this is a heavier cream
simply unclean after using this product
my skin develops a shine sooner than with other cleansing products i've used
it does seem to soften the skin
put it in the fridge as suggested for maximum cooling an puffiness reducing benefits
i'll keep it around for after pore strips
this product is not transforming
i've tried clinique moisture surge
only helps the surface of my skin
it has a nice cooling effect on the skin
calming mask from ptr
seasonal skin that also has acne flare-ups
it sinks into the skin
the downside is like i said it absorbs quickly
so the cooling/soothing effect is short lived
calming with this product
incorporating this product had no visual results other than drying out my skin
thicker oils seem to absorb into the skin better.
powder over this oil to reduce the shine
i do believe this is a well formulated oil
the oil does not absorb well
absorbs into my skin
i consequently break out
with the design of the applicator
the pump dispersed way too much oil into my h
need mid-day replenishment
i break out in a small hive or two on the daily for no apparent reason
easily absorbs into the skin within 5-10 mins
need mid-day replenishment
or lessen dark spots
abundant in the formula
this foamed twice as much as the lancôme with my clarisonic
i specifically wanted a cleanser that would work well with my clarisonic brush
it foams up nicely
i need extra cream to smooth it.
if you susceptible to sebaceous filaments do not buy this because it will clog
it helped shrink my pores
this product absorbs real quick on face
it doesn't absorb well
seemed to magnify my pores
just an average cream that is lightweight
since most samples are specially formulated to maximize results quickly
i like how quickly it absorbs into the skin
which immediately plumps the lines via ha
porous it did nothing flattering
eye cream that would dramatically reduce my fluid pouches under my eyes
it does leave a film so use sparingly.
i exchanged it for the dna line which targets deeper lines
the pump is not well designed
regulate the oil production in my skin
slow the aging process since i'm approaching my 30s
it was light weight
honestly it preforms as well as plain location would on your skin
i ditched this for the spectra 360 electrode gel
the ingredient containing alcohol which is bad for skin
absorb quickly into the skin
i prefer eye cream with more cushion.
when i tested its make up removing ability by putting some tinted moisturizer
i prefer the calming oil cleanser instead.
i usually use purity with the clairsonic.
hence i retuned it.
didn't penetrate/dissolve any makeup
will stick with the purifying one
it smells like a cheap industrial bathroom cleaner
its best for morning cleansing rather than taking of makeup type cleansing
this is ineffective as a makeup remover
it does soften the skin
massage onto the face until fully absorbed helps
keeping it as a h
this cream is easily absorbed
lacks the level of moisture i need
large pores on t-zone
which was expected as my skin was adjusting to the ingredients
just a regular effective eye cream
the effects were super minimal to me
only slightly reduces dark circles
at this point i've weeded out origins as a source of skin care
blends well with the foundation
compact i use as it doesn't separate
use eye cream on a daily basis -- morning
the eye cream is not heavy
it does absorb quickly as a plus
the cream has an instant brightening effect when you apply it
avoid chemical burns in the future
is not effective in diminishing dark circles
it does help to camouflage them
as for the dark circles it is supposed to minimize?
figuring i was building immunity to the formula
almost gel like consistency
just absorb in the skin
the cream also minimizes fine lines.
making my skin tighter
or reduction of fine lines
this did not absorb quickly
doesn't absorb into skin as well as the firming
thus it gives me breakout
applies very smoothly on the face
when i read claims of "patented anti aging breakthrough"
after scrutinizing my skin during
applied the thin layer
oil returns pretty quickly
i realized i put on too thin of a layer
because of that the mask didn't spread on my face evenly
so i applied it liberally to my face.
control excess oil" at least for my face
controlling oil for about 10 minutes
aside from the dryness
put on a thin layer
then apply water to remove any residual
i applied a thin layer
it claims to reduce pores
buy a more traditional clay mask elsewhere
tried doing a thin layer
this mask is easy to spread
use minimally, and have a backup product.
it doesn't prevent breakouts or help reduce oil
which are necessary for the peel-off film
i gravitate toward clay masks
tight after using this
face washes that work just as well
it barely removes any makeup
it caused my skin to produce even more oil.
the only silver lining of the lame packaging is that it preserves the effectiveness of the vitamin c by keeping out air
loads for face products
another product for the landfill.
it might be natural
the product that comes with the pads is too liquid
stays in the recipient
it is light weight formula
stays on skin-reduces puffiness
one that reduces fine lines
it does absorb well into my skin
i've use it faithfully 2x daily for 2 months.
which is fab for an eye concentrate
the moisture imparted did make under-eye products apply more smoothly
also use the face cream
this concentrate is thick
does not absorb evenly or easily in the skin
while the dropper may reduce the cost of the packaging
become aggravated at the waste
thus the three stars
my skin didnt absorb any of the product i applied
which leads me to believe its not easily absorbed in the skin
it didn't really absorb fully into my combination skin
pairs really well with the argan oil
in hopes of getting it to penetrate
does not spread easily
doesn't absorb fast like other products
it didn't absorb into my skin.
good mask for non reactive skin.
it doesn't absorb well into my skin.
this product contains alcohol
the premier cru anti-aging set
they do not absorb
it does not absorb well at all
accentuates my fine lines with its stickiness
does not absorb well at all
it does not apply smoothly over skin
there is no way this removes eye makeup
the cell renewal cream sits too heavily on the skin
this product was heavy
while it does glide on
there are way better micellar waters out there.
environmental debris in the air
it also kind of burns
i am left having to use micellar water
as a long time user of cleansing oils
i choose oil cleaners to avoid the extra step of using an eye-makeup remover
while it removes surface makeup
dissolve all of my makeup off
cloud your vision until your eye does its job
be very cautious when splashing water to activate the oil above your eyes
as it might seep into your eyes
very average make up remover
this takes makeup off very effortlessly
instead of minimizing creasing it makes it even worse
not so enlarged pores
it is not a pore perfector in my opinion
i typically use an eyeshadow primer in that area with much success
i would go for a full bottle of smoothing primer instead
as a solid pore filling primer, it's fine.
the formula is light
mute all make better primers
drug store pore blurring primers do a much better job
tried to dissolve it with the heat of my h
it wouldn't dissolve in to my skin regardless of application method
i returned this for the smashbox pore minimizing primer
i will continue my previous method of using a good moisturizer before concealing
then divide that in half
fill in the lines
i feel that throughout the day my imperfections seep back through
the cap on the tube
it goes on fairly smoothly
doesn't absorb at all
which is a synthetic silicon
it basically hinders air flow to
the dimethicone will "trap" oil
the primer is lightweight on the skin
it will smooth it for a better application foundation
as a primer before foundation
smoothes on easily with no greasiness
all the effects of this product dissipated
upon allowing blur to dry for the specified 1 minute i didnt notice any difference in results that my normal morning or evening facial routines provide
requires the right cleanser before h
great for a top sealing layer over other moisturizers
which might be quick considering it takes 2 or 3 pumps of lotion to adequately provide coverage of lotion?
it has a lightweight texture
it doesn't seem to fully absorb into the skin
in the description it says this product contains ingredients "which [are] specifically designed to minimize
the smell dissipates quickly after it absorbs in your skin
spreads easily on the skin
some minimal fine lines
i like the individually packaged sheets masks much more
such as the karuna
that fun along with a temporary tightening
silky formulation that provided some immediate benefits
because i struggle with texture
in terms of correcting hyper-pigmentation
my search for an eye cream continues!
work in an air-conditioned office all day
i've also mixed it into my makeup
it went on very smoothly with the applicator
squeeze tube was a disaster
any pressure on the tube
the metal applicator feels great for putting this on
the peach color works well for a base layer of covering my dark circles
the triple remedy helps to moisturize my under eyes so that the concealer goes on a lot more smoothly
what it doesn't do is absorb/blend into my skin
i found the applicator to be kind of gross
the metal is very cooling.
the product soaks in nicely.
i don't find the metal tip to be an effective applicator
i like that there is color correction in here as well as a cooling metal depuffer
the metal tip is great though!
the product itself is messy
found an article that stated algae can be extremely pore clogging
this brightening mask became available
skin starting to look congested when i use this
with its hyaluronic acid component
would create a barrier to boost my moisturizer
dennis gross hydra-pure® oil-free moisture with chelating complex

the place for storage for the gel is a refrigerator
it dries very quickly

i did see tighter pores
its refreshing because its in gel form which makes it cooling when applied to the skin
improved tone and texture, easy to use
was excited by the idea of rose stem cells
it does absord well with slightly cooling sensation
maintained my regular skin care regimen
it is too drying for my face as a daily cleanser--entirely subjective
have the patience to use a micro spatula to portion the cleanser
one that is a bit more effective at removing impurities/make up
extracts from six separate types of roses: that sounds nice
there is no attempt to explain how these "patented" technologies are meaningful when applied topically to human skin
fresh however my skin is combo
is enough to spread over my face
it blends seamlessly into the skin
the foundation feels heavy
its more for medium color skin tone.
i normally use light weight foundations
is the incorporation of a dropper to dispense the product
setting powder is a must
this formula is flawless
the generic light to medium shade was disappointing
hoping perricone md will make a lighter version
it wasn't shear enough for me
for choosing to use so many unhealthy acne causing ingredients in their products
i really like that this protects against the sun.
plasticity layer on my skin
i've had issues with dimethicone before
the smell is gross
it is the opposite
find some good quality organic rosehips seed oil instead
it did not seem to absorb as quickly
t does not absorb quickly
resurfacing mask is amazing
application is easy as it glides on under eyes
it is kind of likely a gels.
it dries relatively fast compared to heavier creams
this does not provide the continuous moisture i need
loved the cooling, quick-absorb texture.
i even use a primer for my shadow daily
not effective on fine lines or dark circles.
i'd prefer a more traditional cream
it stings some when applied
i've used pore strips in the past
drugstore pore strips work way better then these.
standard pore strips work better than these.
their version of pore strips
building up excess oil
also pore strip only covers nose unlike other strips that reach out further
takes twice as long as regular pore strips
the drugstore versions of pore strips work better than these
the strip works amazing
the nose strip didn't adhere very well
a sephora employee recommended this to me when i asked for advice on minimizing or unclogging pores
i regularly use drug store nose strips
do nothing for deep embedded ones
get a monthly facial for the resistant ones.
while this product did remove more blackheads than other strips i've used
found that even the cheap drugstore pore strips have greater effect
after massaging in the remainder
almost acting as a hydrator
crows feet stuff was minimized
the stinging prevents me from purchasing this otherwise great product
not with the "duel" packaging or stinging
i started with the nighttime portion
along with its lack of effectiveness
the smoothing effect it has on my skin
the mask has a nice texture that applies evenly
lightly spread across my face while avoiding the eye area
no stinging when applied
just purged my skin
i followed up with a generous amount of facial treatment essence
i also experiences a burning sensation when using this product
which can be beneficial or irritating depending on which part of the plant is being distilled
the product itself is light
the packaging recommends pounding on the counter to "encourage" the process
vs correcting signs of aging
the formula does not seep into your under eyes
the stickiness really negates a lot of that
other properties beyond stickiness
i prefer gels because they tend to skin in faster
it smoothes well onto the skin.
nor can i speak to its ability to remove dark circles or deep wrinkles
i also don't like the stickiness of it
cause even more creasing
heavy for my liking

once i put it on a chemically smell becomes apparent
give me that cooling effect
does not effectively absorb into the skin.
it did not absorb well at all
it did absorb quickly .
my wrinkles are super exaggerated
on the product a crease is created giving the illusion that a new wrinkle appeared
it did not absorb well at all.
i went into sephora for a contouring class
swapped this product with my usual purity
i immediately experienced a flushing sensation
made the skin tone uneven which is a con
takes hours to fully absorb to the skin
i found better quality creams with lower price.
less wrinkle as well
fine lines as well as lighten dark spots
it absorbs very quickly
pairs well with make up.
it smoothes my skin like a primer
will stick with dramatically different moisturizer
it goes on smooth
does not induce breakouts
there are better cleansing oils out there.
trying to fix the damage this kit has caused
note that oil doesnt always equal moisture.
especially for eye makeup removal
other than not stripping the skin
my eyes watered with each application
than the regular oak line
as for the performance of the cream
it claims to be "anti-wrinkle
i used the entire jar with the latter portion aided by fresh's seaberry oil underneath
though i have thin
followed the simple instructions
gross film on my face
defined the fine lines
minimizing pores or anything else
in terms of stabilizing my skin
night after the brightening infusion
it has the consistency of water.
serums by their nature absorb quickly
effectively into your skin
it absorbs easily into my skin
as it does not seem to add enough nutrients or enrichment for my skin besides hydration
this serum absorbs quickly into any area
put it towards a laser treatment
this cream did not soften them at all
it only creates more
it tends to congest my pores
i tried this due to bare minerals changing all of their skin care products
it did remove makeup well
it clearly contains oil as you circulate the product onto your face
it still struggled with removing even non-waterproof mascara
new blemishes every day
"it is non foaming
after i cleansed with this
it has a great texture and absorbs quickly.
help any forming wrinkles
i used it as a pre cleanser to remove my makeup before using my main cleanser to tackle my skin issues
it blurs your vision
the product does melt makeup
however it easily gets into your eyes which causes them to blur your vision
it does leave a heavy
this gel-oil cleanser does not remove my minimal make up
it did transition from gel to oil.
i never experienced the emulsified milk phase not matter how long used it
like to keep methods simple
it was great at dissolving makeup
it doesn't fully emulsify
purity made simple after this
cleanse this would be perfect for you
feels like it will clog pores
to remove my makeup foundation
you must have to use a lot in increments of rinsing
amazing product for removing makeup
had to follow up with some toner to remove the film
i quickly checked the ingredients
the first one is mineral oil
this cleansing oil easily removed my make up with one pump of product
main ingredient in this oil is mineral oil
you are better off purchasing olive oil for $4
it takes off makeup well
it is almost all mineral oil
it is pure oil
sits on top of the skin, does not absorb.
i also use under eye masks
i did like that it absorbed quickly.
it cannot be worn by itself
this product is for normal skin
despite its claims of the micro-particles of hyaularonic acid penetrating deeply
providing long-lasting hydration
mainly due to the extensive use of dimethicone in their products
put a thin layer on
your skin is seriously in need of quenching
its name is drink up intensive
it contains a ton of blue
this didnt help my uneven skintone even after using 1/2 the bottle
assist with the size of my pores
not great at removing makeup residue
the foam breaks down quickly.
while this did soften my skin
how people are saying its calming
as soon as you open the product any beneficial ingredients will start to evaporate
did nothing for oil production or pores.
skin feels smooth when first apply on.
absorbed very quickly and not greasy.
which is actually inside of the sparse "beads" within the carrier product
eventually i stopped using it because it contains potassium hydroxide
it instructs you to use 3 drops 2x a day
1% hyaluronic acid is pretty much all you reap its benefits
even from the natural products
easy to be absorbed into the skin
especially if you consider the fact that actives are inside the tiny capsules
producing more oil to compensate
for that much money i'd rather buy a cooling facial pad
too sticky, and ultimately ineffective.
i switched over to a hydra concentrated serum which is working very well
it feels tightening on my skin
it is light, hydrates and absorbs quickly.
or as a skin hydration boost after a harsh winter
jart ceramidin oil balm to be a fail
i started forming bumps
i go in with the ceramidin liquid
it kind of lays on the top.
the product degrades faster since more if it becomes exposed to air
the solid to liquid state that this oil is in reminds me of coconut oil
it led to full on pimples
act as my "second cleanse
this did not take off eye makeup as seamlessly as desired
easy for the eye makeup to dissolve
also unsure what ingredient caused the staining
this not only wipes away makeup efficiently
using this in conjunction to a real cleanser
used this to remove makeup before cleansing
which defeats the purpose of a cleansing water for me
removes majority of my makeup
however for something that promises to cleanse
i found myself saturating multiple cotton pads to achieve the same results i would have gotten with a single makeup remover wipe
normally i use makeup removing wipes
how does a product go from dense
instant perfecting mask for years
says it has a "corset effect" on the skin.
firming the moment this is applied
the rose serum by fresh sinks into my skin nicely
super drying and no effects.
with the super heavy price tag i expected an overnight miracle
did fresh have to make such a heavy packaging?
for this price i prefer the black tea instant perfecting mask
normally i love fresh products
will cause breakouts gallore if use frequently
like it doesn't absorb.
it said to apply a "generous layer"
rather it sits on the surface
1 star for the permanent smoothing
aside from some cooling effect
that nothing topical can erase fine lines or wrinkles
on areas i applied the cream
i already completed 3 cycles of clarins double serum with really no results
which makes it look uneven
hoping it would be a great anti-aging preventative measure
my much cheaper collagen filler works better
i did see relaxing of wrinkle immediately after applying
it was easily able to be layered with
i prefer "crease relief" leaps
crease release works better
the amount in the bottle is minimal
other than the breakouts
plus, the pump is super faulty.
only get very minimal foam
even after numerous attempts to unclog it
minimizing pores it's not very effective
the small container pump sticks to the point that it won't dispense the product without invoking excessive force
i'll continue using the masks
both times the spring in the pump mechanism failed to work properly
i currently use proactive because i like how it exfoliates
i'd rate this above smashbox primer
i like that it absorbs well
the pros outweighed the cons
not as effective when removing the eye liner which i draw on my upper waterline
the way it removes makeup
the pump gets clogged
takes off makeup effectively
this product is currently collecting dust in my shelf
want to create a barrier on your face
it has a great cooling effect to the skin
despite all the essential oils
due to all the essential oils
because the formulation turns into milk as soon as it touches water
did not absorb well into my skin at all
i also experienced pilling
breakouts with this product
causes it to be red
it is essentially a moisturizer
concealer doesn't go on smoothly
the product goes on easily
i developed a cluster of both milia
it does not absorb easy
turns out that this product contains algae extract that is a major pore clogger
feels like a normal cleansing oil.
i think the product is great for a makeup removal
i typically stick to higher end products
it removes the makeup
removes all my makeup
i've used tons of other oils before to remove my makeup
it hurts to extract them
marula oil on top
after i tamp an oil absorbing towelette on my face it looks much better
this does tighten my skin
for me it only caused additional dryness
hoping this would help to normalize my skin
i didnt have breakouts from this
non stripping for sure
do avoid eye areas because the particles are so tiny
$35 for a bar of soap that is smaller than a bar soap you get off of the shelves is steep
clay in the bar works on drawing out impurities
it does causes drying leading to a build up of dead skin
i'd suggest to sticking with oils with minimal ingredients like d
it did absorb nicely
only stays on the surface
it does not moisturize, does not absorb well.
cream are absorbed very quick after applying this oil
the quality is high
requires multiple cleansings to get a good clean
are for toning more than final step cleansing like western toners
needed the makeup completely gone for the toner tone more effective
who has time to cleanse in three steps
makeup remover separately rather than this product
usually a light layer of foundation with a little setting spray
same with the toning.
as a cleanser that falls into the "precleanse" category
it also claims makeup removal
the processing of wiping off is not good for your skin
the fact that you have to wipe makes it stimulating
it does reduce puffiness
it tightens your skin
it also reduces creasing
iron applicator warms up too quickly.
i do believe that it reduces puffiness
cover my generically under eye rings
foundation or full makeup because it makes the other makeup fade
the tip is cooling
far from optimal results
while it cooled on contact
i usually use origins
didn't hydrate nor refine my skin lines !!
actively work to prevent aging
this works well as a primer
or "fresh" than normal
because i often use my josie maran organ oil before it
it absorbs really quickly
the fingertips i used to apply the serum seemed to lose traction
it does have the consistency of a primer
i layered in on very generously took it off
as an everyday mask?
like the mask made new impurities come to the surface
for anti-aging benefits
the rose stem cell mask
cleanliness that always follows the washing off of a mask
i think the ptr rose stem cell mask is much better for firming
my older dry skin needed a boost.
is paraben free which is another negative
i applied the mask
whilst it curbed oil production a bit
i've used many charcoal masks
it did not do anything to decongest my skin.
it do has some effect in deep cleansing
my skin is usually normal
in addition to other anti-aging products
has promises helping with hereditary dark circles
it does nothing for my genetically dark under eye circles
it works well for fine lines
it stung so bad i had to use cold compress to wipe off
while this product did minimize
the beads in this product are a nuisance.
the product has dots of product included in the cream
need to apply moisturizer over it to relieve tightness
for anyone with genetic dark circles
i've had to unscrew the cap to use the product
it include the glamglow super mud clearing treatment
risk irritate the skin
as it says daily
which is a bit synthetic to me
oil or mask to prevent that
it moves makeup better than products developed to remove makeup
i normally love fresh products
i found it cannot be absorbed.
the hydration was average
have a mixed relationship with this product
instantly alleviates any tightness resulting from cleansing
the cream absorbed nicely
kind of like spreading on liquid
works fine in a pinch
i found it lacked in its cleansing ability when compared to other oil cleaners
the blackheads built up slowly
in my experience a lot of products with natural oils will turn over time
formed chunks on the bottom
this product has a lot of ingredients that are known to be irritants
there are also irritating plant oils in this.
it would be better served as a toner.
it def gets dirt/makeup off thoroughly
don't like the potential for bacterial growth.
need an intense spf with our high altitude sun
so don't apply to dark uneven areas of skin
it works as a mosturiser under my makeup
it also absorbs very quickly.
it softens your skin considerably
in combination with my daily spf 40 usage
had to remove it quickly mostly because of the smell
the texture absorbs quickly, which is nice.
to be patient because it will draw out impurities before you notice glowing skin
although it cleanses well
they focused more on the color changing aspect than actually creating a superb mask/cleanser product
ingredient created that sensation
cons-designed to be applied to dry skin
has a cloud-like appearance
which disappears as it makes small popping noises
loved the cooling effect
my first impressions of this product is that it is marketed to have this "oxygen penetrating the skin bubbling effect"
should help to control acne
rather that it is supposed to soften
it is possibly causing more breakouts
its consistency is similar to jell-o
the high alcohol content is counter productive as well
the complete opposite of the original super corrective serum
the regular lucent moisturizer is much better!
if the product weighs in according to the packaging
make the component smaller to better accommodate the contents
it does clean my skin effectively
the particles are so small?
the size is deceiving
fast absorbing into your face.
above in hopes of achieving overall refinement that his product claims to achieve
likely due to the silicone content
my skin has become immune to the product
with the form of vit c that is most effective
i also had a breakout which i believe was directly related to texture leaving a sort of gummy film on the surface of my skin
it does not go on smoothly.
actually exacerbates the look of pores by causing foundation
it doesn't refine my pores or make cosmetics go on better
high reputation of the bb line
trying to shrink, and cover them.
i own the brushes
it doesn't moisturize as evenly as the previous formula
it takes too long to absorb
it also made my face basically repel makeup
the spf version is heavier
it's heavier than the original light moisturizer
which makes applying primer
it doesn't absorb very well
does not absorb at all.
as far as anti aging
the product blends into nothing on the skin.
it usually takes time for it to adjust to a new product
if they fixed the texture
hoped that this or the good genes would help "elasticity"
it doesn't spread well
the oil in this is green
i find this intolerable for daily use
it also stays in your pores
accentuated my large pores
you're lead to believe that this product is equivalent to retinol
hoping for pigment lightening or pore shrinking
based on her entrepreurial bio
i received my customized blend
creating one serum instead of using 3 or 4 what a concept
it absorbs really fast which was a plus
it will not layer well.
does it erase my pores?
it goes on smoothly
that causes it to pill as well
this does an amazing job smoothing onto my skin.
i do find that it worked ok over makeup to minimize pores
use a pore filling primer
it replaced my current [no-spf
drugstore] primer well in terms of making my makeup application smooth
less "greasy" than most blurring primers
to achieve the effect of the spf
both lead to pilling effects
this product feels great on the skin--it absorbs quickly
while the formula is smooth
it goes on so smoothly
it immediately begins to pill
trying different application styles
i combine this with the primer from stila
my entire face is affected by seborrheic dermatitis
not oil-inducing for my skin
it absorbs quick into the skin
i also tried the fab daily face cream
sits well under makeup.
overall an average product.
i've never experienced such grease on my skin before
the older i get the more oil my skin seams to produce

this "eye essence" was $95
it is cooling to the eye area
alcohol has destructive effects on the skin.
this wouldn't absorb on my face at all.
this is one of the only products that provides lasting moisture
i've tried it with multiple primers
going to return and exchange for moisture surge.
it almost has a firming effect as well.
breakouts on my face
also performs well under sun screen
the cream is to heavy
tight when i normally have regular skin
took my skin a couple of weeks to normalize.
it does absorbs quickly and lightweight.
tends to lead to the dryer side
the product never sinks into you skin to provide actual moisture
causes skin to age more
has a high content of alcohol
absorbs into the skin quickly
tried this after using the moisture bomb.
the gel texture didn't absorb into my skin
i also found it slightly reactive.
has no other factors like brightening or cooling
it failed to sufficiently moisturize under my eyes
it goes on smoothly
have been using for a month along with the belif tea tree toner
it absorb very quickly
i tried multiple times using different thicknesses
it peels off in chunks, and not very easily.
hyper pigmentation looks the same
raw coconut oil works better
i need an eye cream to use under makeup as well
minimizes the fine lines
due to 10+years of tugging from using contacts
this product created lines
while i give it a few points for quick absorption
it does absorb quickly and easy to apply.
also, it does not absorb quickly at all.
it helps my foundation apply smoothly
feels lightweight and absorbs quickly.
absorbs to the skin quickly
thick to evenly apply my whole face
my skin doesn't absorb it well
specifically in the triangular area under my eyes
getting both sides to work evenly just is not working
was great at eliminating dirt
the dual pump constantly got clogged on me
my skin is normal.
i tried more pumps of oil
the how well it cleansed
cause i had high hopes for this cleanser
it causes a reliance effect.
one of skin care's marketing techniques.
it does not strengthen your skin.
it weakens it and make you reliant on this.
it doesn't absorb into the skin very well
i can use cushion foundation directly on it
the blurring part is true
it doesn't adhere makeup well.
it applies a bit heavy
but absorbs quickly and smooths my skin.
it absorbed well/went on smoothly
however, it does not absorb well at all.
then quickly accentuates dry areas
my foundation would not blend
it is hard to incorporate into your face
the way it smooths out my skin tone
applied my makeup like usual
if your skin is normal
can be difficult to spread
the texture of it is not smoothing at all
doesn't absorb very well into the skin
its much easier to blend into the skin
it doesn't absorb well
did not absorb well
it can be hard to spread on
as long as you let it absorb properly
it refuses to absorb in without serious harsh rubbing
work quickly to spread this
i know physical blockers tend to be thick
it started clumping even more while being applied
this product dries ultra fast
the mask definitely reduces my pores
i don't remember it being radically mattifying either
i felt like fully 1/3 of it clumped
so when the oxygen hits the gel it begins to foam up
pass on this, love sephora's cleansing oil.
who uses two cleaners
this gel helped minimize my pores
overall its an ok facewash.
expensive to buy every time spills.
i seriously question the presence of salicylic acid
i liked the bubble action on the skin

very heavy face oil, doesn't absorb.
find in other oils
the representative at the counter mixed it with some liquid foundation
ntrigued by the bamboo aspect of this mask
i can find plenty of residue with a swipe of micellar water afterwards
it removed my makeup well
doesn't mitigate the fact that it does cleanse well
it is neat how it changes from solid to oil to a cleanser texture that washes off
even with a generous scoop of the oil
instead if tissues off
or removing the excess oil with a toner
both methods kind of defeat the purpose of the cleansing oil
it leaves an oil residue which requires a follow up with a foam cleanser for me
i know that this is specifically for gently removing makeup
had my oil mostly under control
does not absorb quickly.
but it doesn't absorb fast at all.
i like that the texture is light weight
didn't absorb into the under eye skin fast enough

i will keep using this in hopes it helps my pores

eventually my skin started to crave more moisture
the stickiness goes away
i found that it didn't absorb well

the eye cream mixed
i went back to using clinique all about eyes serum because it absorbs quicker
feels relaxing to apply with the rollerball that comes in the packaging
it just flakes easily!
it tries out very quickly
i completely fell in love with the precious fluid with spf 40
it seems like smoothens the eye area
this is a really lightweight cream that goes on easily
it definitely reduces puffiness
i don't suffer from seasonal pollen-related allergies like many people do

the pump does not function.
the bottle did not come with an inner tube which connected to the pump
this is a formula that creates immediate/temporary benefits due to its velvety texture
it is super light weight when it is first applied
it absorbs super well
yet the way it moisturizes is different
liquid serum applied nicely with good converge using fingers
it makes the device drag across my skin
was not an easy circulation
organic products as much as possible
utilizing different methods of exfoliation in advance
each time it requires a rinse off to remove the pilling
my skin was never able to absorb this moisturizer

i like the idea of more natural ingredients
i mainly purchased this for reducing darkness under my eyes
it took a lot for it to absorb
the intense amount of rubbinh could lead to premature wrinkles
lightweight enough to wear under makeup.
correct my dark circles
the issue i have with a lot of farmacy products in general is that they always seem to underfill their packaging
the cost was more manageable
prevent from unnecessary air exposure
the top is tapered
delivery system is awkward
the design of the bottle is efficient- it uses an eyedropper so you don't waste product
since it does not seem to help facilitate the absorption of lotion which is kind of the point of a serum
you have to rub it in very quickly as it dries quickly
search for holy grail continues...
the formula also takes awhile to fully absorb into the skin

the foam is really heavy
which defeats the whole purpose of a foam soap
could be toned down
it does a fine job of cleansing

the ungodly texture this has on the skin
avoid like the plague!!
will irreparably damage not only the surface level
the core of your face
not as fast as it claims
the name says "rapid age spot"
bhas are only effective as chemical exfoliants when they are left on the skin
pros:- affordable- lasts a long time- i used to get frequent white bumps
this helped lower them
decided to add this cleansing oil to the mix for double cleansing
i've used drugstore priced micellar waters that have done a better job
but the bottle leaks!
i paired this with the clinique dramatically different moisuturizing gel
i like the cooling effect it has though
still dealing with acne
the product keeps spilling out
have continued to have uncontrollable breakouts
to oily skin where i'm constantly trying new solutions
i switched to the murad renewing cleansing cream
my acne has built a very strong immune system to salicylic acid
the effect was that my skin overcompensated by producing more oil
thus created more acne
this cleanser effectively took off makeup
may be more suited to nighttime use.
i am trying to forestall injectables
it is just a temporary film on the surface of the skin that temporarily might make wrinkles look softer
the hype is that it penetrates the skin.
ceramic slip works so much better!!!!
the texture is gross
use my deep cleansing oil
which i like better than using it as a cleansing balm
i've used much cheaper cleansing balms for a fraction of the cost
as well as ceramic slip
i finf micellar water does a better job
heavy for what it contains
more trash in the environment
alternating every other night with another product
this product absorbs quickly
also the spf is a drawback for me.
need to get rid of excess oil
as far as makeup/grime removal it does nothing
definitely need to double cleanse
this has soybean oil
the trace amounts of makeup it leaves behind
get the original gel
the "actives" are down near the bottom.
this is simply a low makeup remover
still needed two makeup remover wipes after using this
when mixed with water only slightly changes into a milky consistency
