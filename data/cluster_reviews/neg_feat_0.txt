i feel like this could easily last me nearly six months
there was a film even hours after i applied it.
i tried this for at least week, every night.
my face started burning after a couple of minutes of having it on
stayed red for a few hours
for the hours of the day after you've put it on
i ran out in about a month after using only 1-2 times a week
effects last for a very short amount of time
it will last a long time
happy for the first few days
the bumps went away after a few days
it did smooth my skin somewhat after a few days use
bought another one a few weeks ago
did the formula change in the last few months?
i gave it a few stars for the container.
after using it several times for a couple weeks
irritated last month due to over exfoliation
for the summer time
even make an order of moisture balm for my boss every few months
it just felt extremely gross after a couple of hours
i've used it for a few weeks
have been wearing this for about a 6 weeks
it lasted over 3 weeks of daily/twice daily use
i am on the cusp of thirty
applied this for about three weeks
or cuz it just works only on beginners for the first few days?
i tried this product for a few weeks.
it only works for one or two hours
seems to wear away a few hours after i apply
30-45 minutes later i would have to reapply before putting on my makeup
this product made my eyes ten times worse
i returned it after 2 weeks or so.
it's a huge bummer to have spent one hundred points
the bottle is almost gone
it says to use it with the moisturizer a few mins after
i've used religiously over the last few weeks
i saw no change in my skin at all over two weeks of use
change your pillow cases every couple of days
switch the side of your face you are sleeping on every few months
have been using this product now for about 3-4 weeks
it takes weeks to often notice results
within a few hours you are right back where you were
the benefits last longer than about 5-6 hours
tried it out for a few more days
i used the product for a few weeks
no long term changes after a month of daily use
after using this for 3 days
for nearly forty dollars, i expected more.
nearly three weeks after using this cleanser day
used for several weeks and no improvement.
this dried my skin out within the first two days of using it
it really made a mess of my skin after just a few days
after completing the full month long treatment
that wrinkle disappeared over the course of the day
she suggested i wait a few months
after a few minutes it pulls off
it has taken me over two weeks for my skin to go back to normal
evening for about a month
after a few seconds of rubbing it on
an giving the new formula a two week testing period
tried a few of their items
five minutes on my face and i had to wash it off.
within 2 minutes it started to burn
the next morning after using once
the following days after the first time using everything
i been using this for three months possibly
i exchanged for luna after a little more than a week with this
other than that i don't see any improvements in my skin since i started using it a few months ago
have to go over my face a few times
beautiful for several hours
it made my skin look dewy for a few minutes
the cooling effect lasts for about a minute
within seconds after applying
after a few months of hyping myself up about it
the cooling honestly last for a couple seconds
i just can't make myself reach for it after the first few times
my pores were huge after using it for a couple of weeks
a couple hours later my t-zone would become oily
i stopped using it a few weeks ago
just got around to it several days ago
i've tried it with several masks
three days later my face goes back to normal
really only flares up a couple times a month with a few pimples
now it seems i'm battling one or two pimples every month
night for about 4 months
got it a bit close to my eyes for the first few applications
i only use a few drops
like i get a few zits around my period.
every time i use it for more than two days in a row
that since it's only been a short time
it lasted beyond half an hour on my face
it lasted me only 1 month.
i break out more the following day
after using it for a couple of weeks
gave it a fair shot and used for a few weeks.
it worked well the first couple of days
1st one the battery lasted only 10-12 days
battery lasted only 1 week
every few times i use this i end up with stinging
took one at 2 weeks
after over 3 weeks of use
way hoping to experience the total benefit of its claims within at least 2 weeks
however after 3 weeks now of repeated use day
after three weeks of using it, no change!
it was about four weeks
i used nightly for a few weeks
i've broken out for the first time in a decade
if i stop using the product for a few days
this one is just mediocre (got a few samples).
taking at least a half hour to sink in
used it a few days
i put it on about 30 minuets ago
within minutes of putting it on
even tried layering it a few times
it made me break out after a few hours
i returned if after 3 weeks
lasted all day long
i gave it a couple weeks to try
my face has already already settled down some
used it for a few days
after a few days of using this i kept noticing more
before starting it 2 weeks ago i had red dry spots around my mouth since a really long time
it took a couple days before i could feel the hydratation
did find within the first few days that my skin was looking more hydrated
after a few days i started to react to this product
then after a few more applications i started to break out
i kept it for about 3 weeks
more oily during summer months
a month in, i had to return.
changed to this for a few days
especially in the winter months
this was the first product that did absolutely nothing to my skin even after wearing it nonstop for two months
after a couple days of use
marks are nearly gone
this last time they changed the formula
it got better after a few uses a few days a part
i've tried this a few point
i've tried it a few different ways
didn't last long at all.
i waited about 3 minutes
i will try this a couple more times before giving up
night for a month or so
i got this 3 days ago
it goes away after about five minutes
i've used it every day for the past four weeks
only in the morning
every night for 5 weeks
that's twice a day for 5 weeks
night for the last 10 days
it lasted about three weeks
my skin looked exactly the same after the three weeks
returned it the next day!
i tried to work with this over the period of two months
my bottle did at least
goes away after a few minutes
it does dissipate quite a bit after a few minutes
after month 2 the moisturizer started to separate
only problem is that after a few hours of applying it
been using it for 2 weeks now.
unlike the power couple
after only an hour was already fighting off a migraine
a day cream for summer
the bumps disappeared in a few days
whereas before it would last all day
i used it for a few weeks
fragrance is found within the first dozen ingredients
there are several pros
it ended up breaking me out worse than i've been in at least a year
after about two weeks of use i found that my face was becoming more splotchy
i started noticing a few blemishes after using it for just a few days
even after a month of use
not five minutes later
i felt like within 20 minutes
i used my sephora points to purchase this a few days ago
this only lasted about a month for me
masculine odor that last several hours after you put it on
i keep getting whiffs of it over my own perfume several hours after applying
however after using it for 2 weeks my skin just keep breaking out
it has been 15 minutes
it's been five minutes since application
this broke me out within hours of using.
ugh why must i try new things mere days before concerts
maybe last 10 mins i think
i tried it a few times at bedtime
i tried to use this mask a few times
especially during the summer months
then 10 more min later, dry again.
it drys out less than one minute after i put it on
off for a couple months
i tried few other products from here
it will last a long time
it took me a few weeks to get use to the smell
been using this eyelids cream for about 2 weeks now
after a few days my skin on face felt irritated
less than five minutes later my eyes were irritated
i noticed a few hours after my first try my eyes weren't so puffy which is great
three hours later its flakey under my eye
within weeks i got more black heads than ever
a few hours into the day
tried in for 2 weeks morning
it hasn't even been a full week
the product is almost half gone
i tried it a few days with different foundations
it does go away anyway after several minutes.
this product started to dry my face after several days
several days may not have been enough time to produce changes
took home samples on two separate occasions
after a few hours i noticed my tzone was very oily
i tried it several times
i even waited a few minutes before applying my foundation
i stopped using it for a few days
by the first hour after makeup application
does dry down after a few minutes
i read about this a couple of months before sephora started carrying it
i didn't see any difference in my skin after two weeks
for over fourty bucks
so i had to have it just for those hot days.
two hours after application
i tried it over several days
i tried it a few times
for the first few days
after one month of morning
night every day for over 30 days
i tried this over a 3 week period
after 2 days of using it morning
my skin just feels like an oil slick after a couple of hours
after using it for a few weeks
during the winter months
off for a few weeks
i still smell like bubblegum after several hours
it took two weeks to get my skin back to its regularly scheduled condition
it lingers on the skin hours later
after a few weeks of using this
i tried it a few different ways for a few days
i really only saw a few of the results
after using this for a couple weeks my skin started to break out
i tried it for several days
after about two weeks of usage
i kept smelling it even 6 hours after initial application
i am having to wash it off 10 minutes later
out for a long time
breakouts went away a couple days after stopping this
night for about 4 days
i like the five in one concept
found several spots of streaks that i missed during my application
did i get oily within the first couple of hours
which i will say lasted quite about three months
off three weeks now
which only lasts for maybe an hour
after waiting 15 minutes every morning waiting for it to dry it still doesnt
even half an hour later the stickiness still sits on my face
after about an hour
i gave it three days of trial before making this decision
reduced from twice a week to once a week
my issues haven't completely cleared up since i stopped using it a month ago
at most two months?
even skipping a few days in between
might have lasted less?
it only lasted for 3-4 uses
smooth though at least
tried it a couple of times
two or even three pieces
since i have a few other masks from origins
after leaving it on for ten minutes
made me cough several times after intially applying
at least for me
also the after about 2 weeks of use
after about 3 weeks of using it
within 3 days of using this once a day
fresh for the summer months to come
it remained for a long time
number two is the smell
after two month of use
the store had only two in stock
after about a couple minutes
i tried this several times.
box a few months ago.
it made my skin feel sticky after a few hours
after a few days i sarted to notice that i was breaking out more
unfortunately i had a few breakouts myself
get about 9 hours before my current routine begins to breakdown
after a few minutes i notice it becomes sticky
been using it for a few weeks.
my face was still greasy a little later in the day
this product kept me matte for a couple of hours.
after over a month of use
only for about 3 hours
wasn't really expecting the eight hours the product promised
flakes in few areas
next day i noticed many red spots all over my face
within less than an hour
after using for about three weeks i have not seen much difference in my skin
it made me breakout in just a few days of using it
after using it for 2 days
i broke out after using this for two days)
it was gone the next day
to leave it on my face for more than a minute
i gave it several weeks
it took me several weeks to bring my skin back to normal
i've had it for a couple months now
after about a month of use
just after using it 2 nights in row
it goes away after a few minutes
i've gone through the whole bottle which has lasted me about 3 months using it once a day
the formula sits on my skin for over two hours before being absorbed
it does linger for a couple minutes
i didn't notice a difference in my skin after using it a couple times
a day later i was peeling in those areas.
i did not see any results using the product once a week for ten minutes
tried it out a couple of times
i would see dark acne spots disappear within a few weeks
lingers for a few hours
has several dark marks from acne in the past
the tube will last you twice as long
in just the short time
it works for about an hour
so i ended up buying it the next week.
tried on 2 different occasions about 3 month apart
the next day after using this i had two small pimples
less than three hours later i looked in the mirror
a few minutes after i applied it
the next morning i eve had a spot or two
within hours my skin began to breakout
there are only so many hours in a day
the box has four masks.
had to wash it off within one hour
night with my clarisonic for 3 weeks
tried it for 5 days
put it away for a couple weeks
a few days later, more of the same.
a few minutes later it felt like i hadn't put anything on
even in the summer
i used it for a few months
for about three weeks
even after several layers
i've only had this product for a short time
seems to last through a long day
one bottle in less than a month
and i broke out a few times when using this.
wash it off later
i got this about a month ago
it helped my foundation last longer
i've had it a week now
got a good two weeks out of it
albeit it only took a few mins to dry
then after using the product for a few weeks
i've had dark circles for 20 years now
i didn't see any difference after using this cream for a few months
have been using this cream 2x a day for about two weeks
after using it for weeks i saw no improvement.
this made my eyes dry after a few days
after weeks of using this every morning
just bought this product a few weeks ago.
after a few uses it became too thick
it gave me several new whiteheads every morning.
i'll use it up because i'm past my 30 days to return it
returned it the next day
returned after a few weeks.
this should last me a year, five or take.
looks cake-y after a few hours
loved this product for the first few days.
within a week of use i began to see breakouts starting
've been using this for about 3 months now
after three weeks the actual product went bad
i've given it about 15 minutes
this product made me break out like i haven't experienced in decades
after a few days use
its gone within 2 days
tried this product for almost 3 weeks
i am breaking out for the first time in many years
after at least twenty minutes
there were only two or three other ingredients
stings for a few minutes after i put it on
an hour later though
after the first week
three more weeks went by
after one week of use
by after a few days i was breaking out all over
i've use it for about a week now.
the next morning i had a couple of breakouts
broke out within a few days
three weeks after using this twice
i will be returning this product along with 4-5 others i should have returned a few weeks ago
it will last you a long long time.
within two days of using this
have been using it for a few weeks now
it gave me a headache after a few minutes of applying this on i just couldn't st
other people could smell it even when they were a few feet away
let it hang out until i wash my face a few hours later
later in the day
i got it as a sample which lasted me a couple of weeks
have had way better results in a short period of time
after using this product for a few days
i tried this eye cream several times
ten days later i've gotten 3 pimples
i decided to wait to review this until i had been using the product for a few months because of the 95
it's been two months
it has been a month now
after six weeks of use i can't tell a difference
this effect only lasts a few hours
if the lines were softened for a longer period of time
about 5 minutes later i had to wash it off.
it didn't last long
i started using this product about 5 months ago
for a few hours afterward
i picked up a second bottle a few days ago
not even a minute later it is flaking on my face
i waited a minute or two
10 mins later my face started to itch
put it less on the next day
around 4 foundations the last few days which i thought were the problem
this bottle won't last me a month
probably will only last a couple weeks.
a few problems i have with it though are that the bottle leaked about a quarter of the product the first day i got it
i tried it a few times this past week
waited 3 days between tries
it literally lasted me less than a month
after taking it off after about 20 minutes
i applied the mask last night about an hour or so before bed
on 5 different occasions within two weeks
after giving it a good couple weeks
after 5 days of trying it out
even after 10+ hours
had been using for weeks a little goes a long way
mostly just at night
it's almost gone at 6 weeks
however i noticed my skin starting to break out after a few days of use
i end up feeling dry again within a few minutes of using it
i tried it several times as my only moisturizer
at least for me
if this came in at least several shades it could be a 4 or even 5 star product
it actually made it flake off in certain places after a few hours
i gave it a few tries with various foundations
i've had it a few months
then twice a week when i noticed no change
i barely got half a dozen uses from this
texture for about 4 weeks
within the first few uses
i usually break out when having my period
this time its been a week after my period
after 2 weeks or more of use, it is not.
it lasted for me, using once a day, 2 months.
my pores started to clog after only two days
which is moisturizes for a few hours
night for about a week
that i am literally still recovering three weeks later
in a few days i had several large breakouts on my face
on for over a month
for the next few hours my eyes were in fire
i used for two weeks for a ten days for a fair review before returning
after a few hours i began developing dry patches in the t-zone area of my face
the last time i used it was over a week ago
this cleared up all of my acne within two days
i returned after just a few days
i tried it a few times
over ten years ago i used this product for over two years
this is a more recent formula
my skin looked the same after a fews days use
there are also a few that i don't like
as an almost thirty year old
after a few hours my makeup wears like it usually does
i've tried this product a few different ways
been using it for at-least 3 weeks now.
it broke out within two days of using this oil.
been using for six weeks
after using it a few weeks it didn't do anything for my dark circles
night for almost a month
it've been using it for a couple weeks now
most of us would like to use the product for a few months
power eye cream for about 2 weeks now.
used it for 3 weeks which is how long it lasted
i loved this product the first two weeks
i've used this for a few weeks now
night for the last 3-4 weeks
still have two packets left
had to try a few times for product to come out
however after a few days i'm having to give up
several new under-skin blemishes came up after using a few days
2 hours later my skin is an oil slick again
after using it daily for several weeks
have been using it for >2 weeks at this point
i tried it out for a couple weeks
the redness lasted too long to make the product worth using more than 2 weeks
i tried it several times
then for the price of it for seven days??
one $20 bottle is only for one week which means this costs almost $80 a month
other times just a few drops
with it only lasting 7 days
after the first time it now leaks out
i've used it for the last few months
i used this for a few weeks
after i wore it for a few days in a row
after a few hours of wear the product balls up
dark spots on my nearly 40 year old face
that smell wouldn't wash off for a few hours
i only had it for one month
i tried it a few different ways
i got the farsali oil about 3 months ago
left it for a couple months
i tried this oil for a few weeks after hearing people of all skin types raving about it
over a couple months i think it went bad.
the first two times work on my foundation amazingggg
within two days of using it i had breakouts in just those areas
i've only been using it for four days now
first couple of days i did notice it kept my makeup on longer
i ended up returning it after a few months using it
however after 3-4 days of using it
i can literally still smell it on my face 7 hours later
only problem was 2 hours later my face was an oil slick
then came a few little zits
tried for about three days.
i tried several times with various foundations
after two weeks of use
this product made me break out after a few days of use
which i use during the warmer months
after an hour or
two days later my face was super red
came back with a few hours
will update in a few weeks.
i tried it a few times
i saw no results even after a couple times of use
i still had a few tears occur around the nose
after using this i was flaking all the next day
the camera really adds ten or twenty pounds
there were a few problems though
i did get a few compliments on my skin the next day
the bumps were like little welts that thankfully went away after a few days of not using this product
after six weeks of daily use my final verdict is this product just doesn't work for me
after three days of use
it took a few hours to sink into my skin
it took a few days for the breakouts to come
i've had this for 3 months
it still remained separate
i tried this for a few days
i waited a couple days and used it again.
i stopped using it for a few days
after a couple days of use it broke me out in the sensitive under eye area
pm daily for the past 5 months
it’s way past the return window now
it's been almost a week of day/night use
i am undecided on this eye serum currently after approximately six weeks of use
night for about 8 weeks
it's been several times
a few uses in though
after using this cleanser for two weeks
if tried them several times
until the pimples started forming the next day
i used this for a few days
it only lasted on my face for 2 minutes before i had to wash it off because of the smell
i left this on for the recommended 15 minutes
over half of it is gone
have only gotten to use it just one time a day in the mornings for a little over a month
it is almost gone
i've only had it just about 2 weeks
if it makes it to ten washes
even after a few days of use
didn't notice any difference after using this a few times
after a couple nights of use
it only lasts a few seconds thankfully
after a few days of using this product i had a few blemishes
it's been two days since i gave up on it
used the entire bottle over a few months
it took a couple of weeks for the ones it caused to go away
after a few weeks of use my face started to break out in little red dots
off for about two months now
have been using it every night for two weeks
stopped using for a few days
i've used it a few times before bed
even after allowing a good half hour for it to sink in
who has a half hour to wait around?
however after two weeks of use
i felt like i needed to reapply a few times throughout the day
i tried this several times over the past couple of weeks
oily after a couple of days of use while making me break out at the same time
which honestly has only been a couple days
since it just released last week
in a few weeks time
after about 5 minutes i had to wash it off.
there are a few others like myself
after i've been trying for one week
after about an hour
after a few hours it was gone
i did break out after a couple days of use
perhaps seven days isn't long enough
if it takes me more than seven days to get a positive experience
i didnt see any change in my skin after the seven day trial
on day three i noticed several blemishes starting to appear
i tried for several days with same result.
has been tied for two weeks
improve blemish ppearance within a few hours
that time of the month
i always get at least two or three at the same .
so four hours later
i applied it every four hours throughout the day
atleast five minutes later my face had beaded bits of
after using it for about a week morning
after using it for three days it broke me out
this worked amazing the first few times
after few seconds from cleaning the emergence of drought begins in several areas of the face
i started using this cleanser a few weeks ago after all the great reviews i read
after two weeks i woke up with a few breakouts
been using this moisturizer for almost three years now
i've tried it on three or four separate occasions
long-lasting breakouts even after i've stopped using it
i hope to see some of the benefits over the next few weeks
even during the day
two hours after i put this on my face
i tried it out for a few days
it's lasted me around 3 months now
the powder lasted all day without a primer
night on my face for about 3-4 months
i broke out two days after using for the first time
tried for six weeks, my skin worsened.
after the couple of days i noticed red spots on my face after a few hours
they lasted for days until they healed
have been using it for the past month
i would put it on then after a few minutes put on my moisturizer
i didn't notice any changes to my skin while using it for two weeks
i only use it once every few days
product dried up in the container only after about 6 months
breakouts were all over my face in 30 mins
it has been nearly a month
i used this for a few weeks
this explains the breakout i had a couple months ago
returned product after 3 days of use.
even had a few break-outs
it has been over an hour since i put some on my h
after less than 30 mins on my face
i can only have it on for 6 minutes the most
after a few weeks i just can't st
lingered on the skin for hours.
on for many years

a jar lasts a long time
it has been 3 weeks
then stopped for several days
my tube lasted me five months using it every other night
it's been two months since i started using it
the first few nights of applying it to my under eye were great
a few hours later the hydration is non-existent
tried for 3 weeks, no difference seen
it has lasted me a long time
only lasted me 5 months maybe
purchased a couple of weeks ago
there was a cooling effect for a few seconds after applying
i applied it twice a day for a few days
bought this couple of weeks ago
i returned this product because i saw no results after three weeks
the mask left my face red all over after five minutes
4oz for almost one year
i however am a little over two weeks into use
unfortunately i had to return this product-i had a sample that i used for a few days
i've had it for probably three months
apparently it is the "original" formula though it had made my skin burn the last 36 hours even though i ised to use this for almost three years no issue
it does last a long time
i returned it after trying it for about 2 weeks.
for the next bottle
with a few days of am
within two days my breakouts will disappear
it usually takes at least 3 days
takes a few days to see results
after a few days of using it i did see results.
i only use for two week
i didn't notice one difference in my skin after using this a few times
i see results in a few days.
at least for me
finished the bottle about two days ago
i just got wrinkles around my eyes for the first time about 6 months ago
been using for at least over a month
i stopped using it after a few weeks because it really wasnt doing anything for my skin
made my makeup almost disappeared after an hour or so
for the first two weeks it made my skin brighter
hours later my skin feels just as dry as before
after using this for over a week
i tried to give it a few chances
after a few months used it again
almost hitting 4 weeks now
i've gone through a couple bottles of this
i stopped using for a couple days
i received this in my sephora playbox for one of the months
i remember liking this a few years back
i did a few experiments with it
i normally get a pimple or two before a period
the redness stayed away for less than an hour
i decided to give it a couple weeks
within a few days my complexion was more normal
after 2 months i'm giving up
my skin feels firmer after using the product for two weeks
it is 8 weeks already
for me at least
i would have given this a three star
i used fir a few weeks and saw no change.
pore size were back to square 1 after 8 weeks of twice daily use
has only been 2 weeks.
after 2 weeks of twice-daily use
i just started using this two weeks ago.
after a few hours the redness was even worse.
tried this cream for a couple weeks
i tried it out for at least 2 months
i've tried this product a few times over the past few years
i tried the product for 3 weeks
the past couple of days my skin looks better
it lasted a long time
i tried it for about 4 weeks
it started crumbing within a few days of use
two weeks later and it's almost done.
i will keep using it until it runs out in roughly 92 years
has cracked in several places after only two weeks
the bar itself lasts you a long time
have been using it for a few days
after a few days of use i started to break out much more than usual

after using this product for about two weeks i felt that it made my break outs worse

i gave it another try two days ago
my local sephora made up a sample for me that lasted about a week
as all three are at the same price point i would have to give clarins five stars
after waiting a long time
it did last about 5 months
then after a few more minutes the residue appeared
something great will be out in a few years
gone in a few minutes
it only lasted about an hour
after using the product for two weeks
yes, slightly, for a few minutes.
it has been about 3 weeks
i tried it for a few days
i started using this three weeks ago
i tried this on clear skin three weeks ago
for two weeks my skin looked amazing
this was 2 weeks ago
over the past week
night for about a week
within minutes after putting it on
after two months of daily use
it left a white cast on my skin for the first ten minutes
i don't have 15 minutes every day to sit
bought this about 2 weeks ago
stopped using it after two days
as i've only been using it a few weeks
it leaves me really shiny after only a few hours
night for roughly 2 weeks
i tried it over about a 3 week period
’ve been using it for a few weeks
tried for a few weeks
i tried it for two weeks
night for two weeks
it takes a few minutes
after using several samples of this cream for a week
i now have huge breakouts after just a few days of use
this product lasted for about 3 months
later in the afternoon
which only took a few weeks
after i started to use this product about 20days
a few hours later my lids were super dry
an hour or so later
have used it for a few months
when i received this 3 weeks ago i was in love with it
after a few uses it actually gave me wrinkles under the eye
it lasted a little over a month using morning
have been using it for about 2 days now
night for one month
which is 1 to 2 times a day
no difference after a month.
there was enough product in there to last me another month
my skin is more broken out than it has been in 20 years
i returned this after a few weeks to find an oil free moisturizer
i've had it less than a month.
five stars on that note
this cream just stayed on the surface for hours
i stopped using it after a few days.
after a month of continuous use i ended up with white spots
the product lasts maybe 2 months
it lasted me five weeks
i used it for a few days
after a few weeks i saw no improvement.
that was over 2 hours ago
the positive: the product lasts a long time
after only 10 days of use
i started getting breakouts within an hour
a half spent in hope
tried for a few weeks
i wore this for several months
have been using it for almost 3 weeks
so far i have been using it twice a day for 4 weeks
that was a few months ago -- i'm almost done with it
so even after months of use, nothing at all.
used it for a few weeks
i only have 2 weeks of results
will report back after 2 more weeks
according to the reviews they saw results within a few days
i did not make it past 3 days due to stinging
ten days have long past
i tried this for several months
mostly, after 3 weeks, i don't see any results.
even though i used this serum consistently at night for a few weeks
i've used it for over two weeks now with no changes at all
with a few subsequent applications it burned holes in my skin
i look ten years older.
caused me to break out after a couple of weeks
this stuff was glorious the first few days
an hour after applying
have been very successful in keeping my skin clear in the last ten or so years
it took about ten days
after several days of using it
because i had gone a few months without using it
lifting for a year now
nor after a few weeks
i've used this cream 2-3x a day for a few months
i've used this balm for a few months now
even for just a couple of days
it has taken a couple of weeks
i need an eye cream that i can go a few days without
nightly for about two weeks
after a few weeks of wearing this
i've had it for almost a year
i've bought this cream few weeks ago.
it was enough for a few days
it was 0.5 oz and lasted until just last week.
i started off with a small sample for a few weeks before purchasing
used this for a few months
this within seconds makes my skin look a few years younger no doubt
it lasted about 5 hours
after having used this product for a few weeks
after about an hour
only lasted a few hours
i put it on 2 days ago
this also doesn't last 8+ hours
after using a few times
after a few hours though
i tried it for a couple weeks
within hours of using this for the second time to wash my face
i tried it for several days
only problem is that after a few days it broke me out
i took a break and will try again in a few days.
my makeup separates within a few hours
i gave it two stars because it must last long.
approximately two weeks after i started applying this product daily
stopped using this for a few weeks in favour of a facial oil
couple of weeks later- dry
i tried using this for a few months now
i started using this two weeks ago
over the past year or so
this cream does last a long time
after a few days i started to seriously break out all over my face
after hearing a few friends talk about it
have had for a long time
it lasted me for quite some time
i used this for a few days
have been using this for a few months now
have been using for 6 months now
product lasted longer than i expected
have been using 2 weeks
i returned this after using it every day for several weeks
this product actually irritated my skin the first couple of days
the following couple of weeks redness remained
i will wait a few more weeks to complexity decide on that
after two weeks of use
continued to burn for about 15 minutes
after a few weeks of using
i used this eye cream a few weeks before my wedding because of all the reviews
i've only been using this for 3 weeks so far
in fact they seemed darker after a couple weeks use
it's been about 3 weeks now
the first few days i thought that it really reduces dark circles
after waiting for a while
after a couple of minutes the cream started 'curdling'
tried using it for a few days
cakey--even after i wait at least ten minutes
even in the short term
after a few weeks of using it i didn't notice any difference
i received this as a sample in two separate orders that were spaced about two weeks apart
i still use 4-5 days a week
was trying to save a few bucks
night for 4 weeks now
since i got this 3 months ago it's impossible to return now
i tried it a few different times
for the first few days i did love it
this was only after using 3 days
disappear within an hour of application
use a few others from him
i actually returned it within a few days.
within a few minutes of applying my eyes were burning
i switched back to another eye cream for a few days
have gone through several containers
it has been about 2 weeks.
takes a few minutes to absorb
it wasn't until a few weeks later that red spots began appearing in the places where i had applied it
or at least it was for me
i got a few samples of this a few weeks ago
after 4 days of using this
after just two weeks
after using it for several days
i only used it for a few weeks
i've only been using this for a couple weeks as my day eye cream
which i have noticed in the last year or so -- i am 32
continued to use it for a couple days
i returned it after 2 weeks of nothing.
for about six weeks now
have been using faithfully for four weeks
i've seen several complaints about the product not lasting as long as people thought it would
was rather unhappily surprised to find that the container only lasted for about 2 weeks
after about two weeks
after six weeks i did not see any further change
then some hours later
i've since gone through countless jars of this
after a few weeks of use
i mostly use this in the winter or light make up days
smooth the next morning
headache within an hour's time
after 6 months i had to return both products
the next morning i had two pimples
i gave this a try for a week on two seperate occasions
have been using it for three weeks
you probably have to use it a couple of times per week
after one month use
returned it the next day
i applied this before bed for a few weeks
this is the first time this has happened in years
for day or night
the first couple of days were great
things changed about a week in
used this for a few nights in a row
i tried for 3 weeks
caused my skin to break out after a few days of use
noticed that my skin cleared up within a few days
after doing this for a few consecutive days
i've only been using two weeks got to give it more time
it usually lasts for around 30 seconds.
i've had dark circle for like 3 years now.
the reason i'm giving this product three stars is because for the past week
i tried it for about two weeks.
i tried it a few times
in the two or three days i've been using this wash
i stopped using it two days ago
after using it for a few days
within a few days i started breaking out really badly
only lasted me a little while
do not use more than once every couple days
after four or five weeks it has shown somewhat improvement
these marks lasted nearly 3 weeks.
it should last a long time
hours later or even the next day if i apply it at night
after using it for a few weeks i can't tell a difference
maybe after i have tried a few other lines
at least for me.
that the hydrated feeling only lasted an hour or so
i'll give it a few more weeks.
after a couple of minutes of applying it on
so the following day
after a few days i began to feel a bit of irritation around my nose
i gave it another try a few weeks later
about a week ago it occurred to me that this was the only product i added to my skin care
i stopped using this a few days ago
woke up the next morning to several little breakouts on my face
been using this for a few months
after a few days i had dry patches
after trying it for a few weeks
this alone for a couple of weeks
after nearly finishing the bottle in the course of 4 months of twice-weekly use
maybe except some of them like two or three
my skin has been near-flawless for weeks
a few on each cheek
i tried it several times
on for the past two years
used the whole thing a couple times a week over about 6 weeks
i left the mask on ranging on many times from 15 minutes to 45 minutes
i also used another mask a few days after this one
have been using this product weekly for a few months now
will give it a few more attempts
i tried this for 6 weeks under one eye
i waited almost two monts before posting a review
day for about 3 weeks now
after a few hours it looks as though i never even applied it
after two weeks of using this cleanser once daily
after using it twice a day for two weeks
this was a while ago
for me at least
the benefits don't last that long
i returned it after five days of trying to make it work
i tried leaving it on for longer then ten minutes the second time
i might just have to try it a few morw times
i tried this mask several times
within a day or two
made me break out after several attempts.
i usually give a product several tries before writing it off
just a couple hours after applying
have acne flare ups every few weeks
i returned it within 2 days.
after a few days i noticed that my nose area would sting after application as well
the face wash that goes along with this product i have had for almost 3 months
good product, but lasted less than 3 weeks!
a couple hours later i could tell my dry areas looked worse than when i use my regular cream
about 5 hours passed since the application
the few breakouts i had got worse by then.
off for a few years
i waited a few minutes before i went to prime my skin
only lasted about a month
and it didn't last long.
this was one of my most recent orders
in the last few years i've started to notice fine lines under my eyes
after using this product for a few weeks
just visibly reducing wrinkles for a few hours would have made it worth it
about six months ago
two times a day for two months of patting on this on
i started using this about 6 months ago
i've had this product for a couple of months
patchy not even five hours later
6 hours later it still sitting on my skin
the next day however
one bottle lasts a long time
my time limit to see results is usually 4 weeks
after 6 months this has done nothing for me.
after about 3 weeks, it does nothing!
after a couple of days of using it
after 2 weeks of my other eye cream
after using for several weeks
we have been using it for a couple of weeks
after only a few days
a regular one during the day
i heard of many people having a purging period
about 2 weeks after starting to use it
after 3 weeks of use i am still breaking out.
spending almost 200 on this?
for nearly $100, i would expect some results.
after one month of use
that didn't last long
kept trying it out for the next 5 days
for the first 2 weeks or so
only the first week or so
after 30 days of using the product before bed
which is a lot more intensive than my previous moisturizer
for the last 3 months
i loved this for about two months.
tried it for about 4 weeks
the moisture doesn't last more than 2 hours
just a few hours after putting on my skin felt heavy
t will last for at least 3 months for me
found several new blemishes all over my face
then i wanted to use my glam glow a few hours later
within an hour or
ice tried several times to make it work
this product was ok after few uses.
would recommend spot sampling several times before using all over your face
the sample lasted me a good three weeks
i received this in my play box a few months ago
then add another layer later
i tried several times
with a week in between
2 months isn't a very long time
lasting a longer period of time
had a couple of break outs
i gave it two rounds about two months apart
with only a few lines around my mouth
it lasts a few weeks if used daily
used faithfullly for a few weeks.
my face was an oil slick within a few hours
i returned it 2 days ago!
face for over 30 mins
bc i've spilled it several times
after a few weeks use
i still gave it a chance over the next few days
as it doesn't last once the product has been on for 15 minutes or so
i could still smell it a few hours later when going to bed
you get over the smell after a few uses though
for me it had a sticky residue that remained several hours later
i ended up breaking out the first few weeks of it
however -- it's only for about 1 or 2 hours
not for more than a couple hours
works only for the first hour
i've tried this a few days in a row
i left the house an hour ago
at almost half the price
i've never in my life had a product make my face look greasy after a couple hours
half week trip to europe last year
night for about two weeks
it's nearly all gone
after i tried it in a few days the smell wasn't that bad
for someone who regularly has to get up at o'dark-thirty
be at work at six in the morning
using for over three weeks
after less than 2 weeks i already see the bottom of the stick with maybe a week's worth of usage left
i didn't see a difference after using it for a few months
i returned it within 48 hours of purchase
within 3 weeks the rest of the product was dried out
lasted me for about a month
i used this a few more weeks
got more all around results in 3 days than 2 months on the ren product
there is enough product only for a few masks
left it for less than ten minutes
approximately 2 hours after application
pluses: it last a long time
i've had it for a year
i just used it again for the first time in a couple of weeks
i got a few little pimples during the first week
after trying it out for 5 days
pm for almost 2 months
after using this for two days
continue the craziness for two months
didn't make my face hurt :/ i used it for a few weeks
i used it for a few weeks
even 2 months later i can still smell it
i tried it a couple times
night for about a week
i've tried it several times
i did get a few small bumps on my face the next day
my skin was oilier than normal a few hours after use
its only been about 3 weeks tho
i don't really notice a huge difference after using almost 2/3 of the bottle for a few months
then continue to breakout for days after
it's been an easy three months at least
i used it a couple times a few days in a row
its been four months
i tried this for four months
after almost 2 months of bad skin
after about 4 days of wearing it morning
had a few pimples in the morning
it is the first thing i have returned to sephora since i started purchasing here a couple years ago
also after 2 hours i was still an oil slick
couldn't see any difference after a couple of weeks
only been using it for two weeks
i did so for about 3 weeks
however after a couple of hours the makeup still settles
i tried it for several weeks
result don't seems to last all day
until the next day
after using this for a couple of months though
after only a few uses my skin was clearing up!
i ended up with redness for about 2 days after
i tried for two weeks
i felt like after a few hours my skin was shiny
it hasn't lasted very long
after a significant period of time using "clear day ahead"
it helped one spot after about two weeks or applying twice a day
it takes a few nights to get some results
for a few years now
i've only been using this product for three days
it only lasted me about 3 weeks.
i only lasted two nights before returning.
i tried to reposition it a few times
after 15 minutes i removed it
works fast for a ten minute solution
i spent many hours this particular day crying
plus i do not have twenty minutes each day to just lay down to use the mask
that hasn't happened for months
'll give it a few more days
for the price i'd expect it to work overnight or at least after a week
the bottle lasts a long time
half bottle left after 4 months
first weeks was not as drying though
i let it set for a few minutes
i used it for a few months , 3 to 4 times a week.
it seems to last a while
after 3-5 days or so
i must say that within a few days of using this product
worked with this for three months
within two hours i was soaked with oil
maybe i should have waited longer than a minute or two to apply this
getting barely a week per tube
which took 2 weeks as they said
just don't expect huge results in the first 2 weeks
nevertheless, i have tried it about five times.
i know it lasted less than 5 minutes on my face
t lasted about 2 months
cons-pricey for only lasting less than two months
the serum has a initial strong smell to it that goes away after a few seconds
because it only lasted 5 weeks
after several minutes my skin went back to dry again
i usually break out more around the few times i have tired it
i tried this moisturizer a few months ago since i needed one for my acne-prone
after a few days i did get some pimples
night for about a month
a few weeks later i feel that my skin is very dried out
after a few days of application
i noticed that about a week into it
lasted like on month
i also noticed that after a few days of using it
just after one use
it's been about 4 months and no results.
on to the next one.
enough to use every day for several weeks
i never noticed much of a change from day-to-day or week-to-week
two or three months later
been using for months now
even after a few weeks
wears off after only a few hours.
will give it another few weeks, and may return.
after using this for a few months now
missed maybe two days
minus a few misses here
the tube split at the base after barely 3 weeks of use
i tried it a few times
i tried product for several weeks with no improvement whatsoever
overall i can see no improvement after several weeks of use
the tube barely lasted that long
have been using this product for almost 3 weeks
night religiously for the last 3 weeks
using it for maybe 4 days
it went away after i used it for a few weeks
i continued to use after months
i noticed a couple new breakouts after three days of using this
this oil unfortunately led to a few breakouts
usually just a spot/a couple spots here
after only 3 days of no use
i hope for this price it lasts at least 2-3 months
its been two weeks
i tried two bottles a few months apart from one another
i've gone through almost one bottle
within a few days created a continuous breakout situation that is still plaguing my face
it has been 2 weeks
i just started using this product 2 weeks ago.
unfortunately after over four weeks of twice daily use
they were a bit calmer the next day
have had a few accidents with it spraying all over
after a few weeks, i decided it wasnt for me.
i began to have breakouts a couple days in
even after four weeks for continuous use i did not see any change in my skin
i used it for a few weeks.
i don't see any improvement in my 53 year old skin which looks ten years younger anyway
it was fine for the first few weeks
spent some time with me
i tried it for a couple of weeks.
within the 3 weeks i had the product
stung for two days after using
however i've been using it for a few months now
after an hour on
after a few days i stopped using
in less than a week i started to notice results.
it's been two weeks.
my skin was good for the first few days
lasted only two months before it ran out.
neck within a couple of days of using it
i tried to give it a couple of weeks in case my skin was purging
this is breaking me out after less than 24 hours of use
it only lasts about a month
after only 2 weeks the pump has stopped working
i ended up returning this after a few days of use
however within a few hours
really...three weeks and i'm out?
all three time the pump stops working after a week
over the last 8 months
i tried it for about 2 weeks
it lasts me for only about an hour
for the next 10 minutes i felt like a layer of my face had been removed
you're supposed to leave this on for ten minutes
i gave this about three or four tries once a week
after a few months what product i did have was completely dried out
within 24 hours of the first use i had breakouts like i haven't had in years
have been using for over 5 years
i needed an eye cream that would treat the few fine lines that have cropped up in recent years
6 months later... i am not impress.
been using product for a couple of weeks in the morning
after two weeks of usage
have been using it for about two months
a day later i noticed/felt bumps all over my face
after using the cream for a couple of weeks now
after testing this product daily for the last several weeks
after using it for a few weeks now
milia after a few weeks
i am just starting to notice some fine lines on my face in the past few years
did get a few breakouts
my spots are still there after faithfully using this twice a day for almost 8 weeks
is absorbed in less than 5 minutes
maybe due to length of time on the skin?
within a few weeks of continued use
im using it for 2 weeks straight now
i finished a jar a few weeks ago
pm for two weeks
after using it for a couple of days
i stuck it out for two weeks
for a few minutes after
after a few minutes i felt this burning sensation on the areas i applied the product to
i tried using it a few times a week for a month
a couple days after the mask as well
i left it only 10 minutes
after about 30 minutes it was less red
an hour later it was almost back to normal
my cheeks stayed red for a few hours.
lasted four applications for me
after a month or three weeks of using this product
in fact i developed another blemish a few days ago on my cheek after using the supermud mask
having been using since the winter months
those days are long over for me
this fell short in those two areas
in less than 2 hours
after a few days of using it under make-up during the day
this product worked for only a couple of hours for me
the dryness lasted for about 6 hours
i felt like it only lasted three to four hours
run in the bathroom every couple hours to "reapply" this product?
works all day long
the first couple of weeks using was nice
it has lasted quite a long time
this happened a few other times after that
i've added it to my foundation routine for like the past couple weeks
ive been using it for a few months
have been using this for 2-3 weeks every morning
a sephora employee recommended this over a few others
it made me break out two days after i started using it
i tried it for about two weeks
its been a week now
its only been a week
even in the day time
it lasted a very long time for me so this was a plus
i waited the two hours yet saw no results
tried it over the course of a couple of days
unfortunately this one consists of a few.
tried it again a few days later- same result.
even after months of routine use
i tried it for a few days
i tried it a few times just in case
i even tried it a few more times
after a couple of weeks as soon as i applied it under my eyes it burned
i stopped for a few days
i ended up taking generic benadryl several times
not just for a few seconds but for 1 hour+.
it lasted me almost 2 weeks
within minutes of applying it
saw no changes after a few weeks and returned.
after pictures at 2 months
night for a few weeks with no change whatsoever
a few days ago i realized that the scar was raised even more
the next morning i had three giant whiteheads in the area that i applied it
i breakout after i use it for couple of days.
after using it for 2 weeks
waited a few more minutes
for about a month now
even hours after you’ve applied it
i tried them separately for a few more weeks
i put a bit around my eye area two days in a row
two days later it still hurts to remove makeup in that area
it's been over a week
it took months for these to clear up
my break outs were few but annoying.
tried again and within two days had break outs.
this week i applied it 2 nights in a row
i tried it for two weeks, with the mask.
got almost 4 months out of it in case you are wondering about how long a jar can last
i tried the product for a total of 2 weeks.
it was wonderful the first few days i used it
after about 3 days it made me breakout
returned it after 5 days
on a few other occasions i've changed my foundation product
the gals at the store both swore they saw results after using for just a few days
the moisturizer 4 days consecutively
i'll try it overnight for the next few nights
after using it every day for over a month
after 2 weeks of daily am/pm use
i've used this almost every night for at least three months
only lasted for 3 months
after just one use
with that being said this product did start to burn my skin after a few days
have been using this product for almost 2 months now
pm for several days
it's been several days since i stopped this
sensitivity has not yet improved several days after stopping it
by the last few days my skin burned when i put it one
after using it twice a day for one month it seems eyes are puffy
this has rarely been a problem in the past.
after a few weeks of using this i am stopping.
one at night- one during the day
night for approximately 2-3months
i've had this for a couple months now
especially when i had skipped a couple of days
so far i have been using the product for 4 weeks
after several months i have seen no results.
i switched back to an old cream a few days ago
as the months went by
night for about a month
night for over a month
i got a tube 2 weeks ago
it has happened several times
only a few days after i started using its product my face looked radiant
the smell last a long time
after using it for a few weeks it just didn't do anything for me at all
or at least it doesn't last for long
have been using it for the past few days
after a few days my skin got used to it
was nice for the first few weeks
at least a quarter of the product has dried out
in just two weeks
i look at least 5 years older in the eye area now
after a few months of use
it may have been breaking down chemically or something after a few months
it didn't go away until about a day later :(
still continued to itch for several days
purchased this a couple months ago.
my skin has felt dry for a few weeks now
the bottle lasted longer than expected
woke up maybe three hours later
i tried a sample of this a few hours ago after i got out of the shower
it lingered on my skin for hours
because it takes hours
after using it for 3 days
this stuff made me break out within three days of using it
have given it more than a few weeks to get used to it
applied it the next morning within an hour i had an oil slick on my face
so much that i started buying the bottle about a couples months every now
takes several minutes to sink in
after 20 minutes or so
its effects last a long time
bumps that lasted for 3-4 days
i returned it within 24 hours
even after it had been absorbed
it is already half hempty
not having breakouts for 8 months
then i switched to once per day for a couple weeks
have repurchased it several times in the past 2years
loved this product for the first few nights
i ordered this oil a couple months ago
using it for a few weeks
i used it for a couple of weeks before returning
i applied it about an hour before bed
i've seen no results from this after using for 2 months straight
i actually returned the product after trying it for a couple of weeks
i broke out again after a few nights
night for nearly a week
i tried this for four days and had to stop.
after a few months of debating weather of not to buy it i finally caved
the entire bottle barely lasts 6 weeks if you follow the application instructions
i've tried it for a couple of days now
in the morning too for about two weeks
dennis gross products for a few months now
i decided to try it out again this evening--i've had it on for a few hours
the price is very hard to take in addition to the fact that this barley lasted me a month
after testing this out for two weeks
even in the summer months
i break out like crazy about 1-2 days after using it
third use in two months
at least over time
while it did provide a satin finish for a few hours
i gave this a good two weeks of use
it takes me several minutes of pumping to get enough product out to use
decided to give it a few days to see how my skin reacted to it
blotting a couple a times an hour
where i've had just a few white bumps develop
after starting with three times a week
after about three weeks of once a day use i started to notice good results with increased firmness
for the first 2-3 days
the next few days were a mess!
this has only happened one other time
tried it a few more times
had to return it after a few uses
few days later they have developed into pimples
at least on my skin
judging by my skin for the first few days
i am taking a few days off
had lots of break out after using for two days.
returned it after 2 days.
tried for a few days
during the summer time
after using it for three days
during the winter months
water are the first three ingredients
bottle lasted about 2 months.
after using this serum for a few weeks
have a few fine lines
had a breakout within a week
will use it a few more times
tried it for a few days
after 4 days of use with new break outs every 12 hours
put a few drops in my h
i tried the above-mentioned samples for several days
it has been a few days
let it sit for atleast half an hour for about a month then i ran out of the product
i ended up using more than half the container within the 2 weeks i tried it
7oz bottle over the course of 2 1/2 months
it's been about 3 weeks
after about a week i started noticing my skin feeling really dry later in the day
i needed three to four for my face
after using it for one month day
you will run out of the product in about 3 weeks
half the product was already gone
i've tried nearly all of them
got this about a month ago
after leaving it on for not even an hour
even after washing my face several times
it off about an hour ago
from the ingredients to just a few reviews
however, after 2 weeks of using during daytime.
i still have to blot my face several times a day with this
by the way i've been using this for two weeks now
within an hour of using this
after using it for three months
tried it for a few nights
i hoped for an improvement within a few days at the most
it lasted for a few weeks
7 oz over 3 months every night after cleansing
i put it on at night only for one week.
but after 5 days of use, i started to break out.
the stinging disappears after a few seconds.
i've had this for almost 9 months
i stopped using this for next 3 months
i can say that after using it for several months
night for about a month
night for about 6 months
it has lasted quite a while though
i still have almost a 1/4 of the bottle left
night for weeks now
after two weeks of use
wish i hadn't spent the money--about a month later i started to see some dryness under one eye
which lasted me for a little over a month
may try again one or two years later.
i actually could only use this for a few days before i ended up returning it
after only a couple days of use the skin under my eyes looked
then my dry skin would flake up again just a few hours later
after about 5 days or so
i've had my bottle for about 10 months now.
about a month ago i decided to give this another try
this has happened 2 times now
it's lasted me about 4 months
2 times per week usually
several things happened after using this product: a major break out
out or fall short
bought this a few months back
its been over a month
i still tried to use it a few more times
i waited past the 2 week period of adjustment.
good for winter months.
the result was a few breakouts
that lasted me at least a week
it usually disappears within 2 hours
on to the next one.
have been using it everyday for the past 5 months
i will stop using this for a few weeks
by noon i'm counting down the hours until i can leave work
i did see results the first week to about 3 months
after two months i started getting pimples again
one after another at a time
well after 3 month of use all bottles were about 25% gone
it has not been 6 months
dissipated after a few minutes
i felt so oily within a few hours
my skin felt smooth the first few times
used this for several months now
it on for about 5 minutes before i had to wash it off
after about a week of use
was hopping to see results after a few weeks.
i know it days see a different in 10 days
noticed a glow after using this for a short period of time
le for a few minutes
i've only been using this a couple days
my skin is only now getting back to normal almost 6 months later after religious use of retin-a
i kept using it for two weeks
i am only about a 15 days into the product
stopped working after about a month
have had this product for over a year
haven't had a breakout in many months
i received this product a couple months ago
evening for about the last 6 weeks
i felt like a had a lot more breakouts the last couple weeks
for those two reasons
stopped using after a few days.
i continued to use this for about 2 weeks
as after three days my skin was red
it's been over a week
for the first few days
it has been about 6 weeks now.
after a few weeks i have noticed no change.
worked in the first few weeks
later in the day
an hour to several hours
i even took pictures every couple days to track the progress
10 mins later it rolls off
i waited a few weeks
in the first two weeks
it was great for two weeks
the bottle lasts for three or four months
within days of starting to use it
one container lasted two months
night for four weeks
others are noticing a change in a few days to a few weeks?
been using this now for 3 weeks
a few hours after i put it on
it has been a week
used if for a few days
that i've done many times before
i returned it after using it for 2 weeks.
this is the only product i have tried in the last five years that has broken me out
i gave it another try months later
absorbs completely after about ten minutes
i experiment several days with this oil under my foundation
after using this product for several weeks
each time within the day
for almost $50 i was expecting more
it lasted me about 3 months
has led to some breakouts in the past couple of weeks
made it to day three
after trying this for a few months i just don't think this is the product for me
i tried it for three weeks
i've had this for several months
after 3 months of use i see no difference.
i just couldn't get past the first two days
two weeks later things are just settling down
i tried it for a few days
it has been over 2 weeks since i stopped using the cream
when i went to return it two days later
i just started using this stuff a couple of weeks ago
after using this for about 2 months
after a couple days of use
i tried it for a few days
about an hour after applying this
it last on me for about 5-6 hours which is okay.
after an hour or so
after a couple of days of using it i started breaking out in little pimples all over my face
it has been a week of continuous evening use
in addition to giving me a few break outs
after a month an half
after using the product for three days i started seeing breakouts
had to discontinue use after five days
couldn't get past the intense burning that occurred about 10-20 minutes after every use
have to re-apply in a couple of hours.
i get a pimple every few weeks
if it was on clearance for a few bucks
its only been a little over two week since i started to use it
i also didn't see any results after two weeks
i can't even finish the basic 5-minute nuface regimen without having to reapply this gel several times
it should last as long as the 5-minute regimen
which can last throughout the 20-minute advanced regimen without the need to reapply
it took about two weeks for my skin to clear up
after using it for a few weeks
for at least one minute
rritated on the next morning
then about an hour/hour
i will try it a few more times
few tiny zits risen up
within 20 minutes it seems to have disappeared into my skin
it did fix my problem after a few uses
which lasted about 2 1/2 weeks
it's been about 2 months of using this twice a day
break out just two nights of using it
after less than a month of using it
i started using this product a few weeks ago.
night for about six weeks
should last a long time
about an hour after putting on foundation
i found my skin looking drier after a few weeks of use
i applied it for several days just to be sure
the first few days of trying
i used this cream for a few weeks.
for about two hours
with 3 weeks of use now
it's been several months
i've only been using about three weeks
after this trial period
maybe if it were fifteen to twenty dollars instead
then after waiting a day or two
mind you, i just did it 5 mins ago.
my face feels nearly the same afterwards
i attempted the mask two additional times over a three week span
i did a few things, waited the 20 minutes.
it took probably 10 or more minutes to peel the majority off
off for a few weeks before finally giving up
a few hours later my forehead has about 4-5 small pimples
despite using it once or twice per week for the last few months
lasts for a loooong time
after using for two days
over the last few days i have been trying to figure out why in the heck was my skin so dry
it deserves a few stars for that alone.
i've ordered it three different times though
i kept using it two or three times a week
after a few hours it starts to peel off bit by bit
i tried this a few times
used it a few times before returning.
i just began using it after having it on a shelf for just under two months
i saw no difference at all after using it for about 5 weeks
wanted to wait a few weeks before giving my results
a few weeks later i tried it on my husb
there for a few seconds with my nose over the container just drinking it in
after using this product for three weeks
on to the next one...
reached for another sample of this a couple of days later
it lasted me almost a month
after a couple of days it burn my eyes
i've tried it over two weeks
if it were in a pump i'd give it five
it lasted maybe a week
it lasts for all day
there's a huge problem however- all the benefits my skin has been receiving from other products the last few years diminished after a few weeks of using this
after i stopped using it for a couple of weeks it is starting to go back to normal
i waited almost 45 minutes
even after having it on for a long period of time
after two mins i had to rise off since it was too overwhelming
i used it for a few weeks
on to the next one
my skin is soft for three days by just using it one time
i tried it a few more times
two stars instead of three for the price.
when i use this cream it balls up after a couple minutes
in just the past 2 days
after a few minutes it completely flakes off
it did after using this product for a few days
its been over s months
flakey within several minutes
wow, i've tried several times.
my sight is blurry for at least five minutes after i've used this product
after the recommendation of a few you tube gurus
it only lasts about an hour
only blurred them for the first hour it was on
i used it for a few days and sadly returned it.
at least with my skin
downfall was, the benefits lasted about an hour!
have makeup-less days recently
have had it less than a month
the jar cream lasted me almost four months with twice a day use
its almost gone within a few minutes after you moisturize your face
another thing was that after a few days of using it
after an hour of application
some huge bumps were showing after three days using it
i've had this mask for about 6 months
after only a few hours of wear
this cream gave me three pimples after three days of use
and i gave it a good try of at least 3 months.
burned for over a half hour
after 2 months my skin is brighter.
it is too oil and my eyes hurt after few hours
i felt like it made my dark circles worse after a few weeks of use
i tried it a few times
it went back after two weeks.
i just started using it not long ago
fast forward to two weeks
now that i've had it for a little shy over a month
i've reached for it about three times.
almost each one of them were glowing
i tried this product for a full two weeks
the first couple of times
which is to use a normal amount for 10 minutes
i've had it for 9-10 months
if the break out does not get under control in the next few days
i've owned this product for a few weeks now.
i just used this mask ten mins ago
i finally eliminated several products
leaving on for 10+ minutes each time
peeled after a few days
its been two days i stopped using it
within another use or two
a couple days ago i discovered really dry
the first several days were good then my skin completely dried out
you use it a while even months
it will last through the day
this broke me out in just a few hours of using it
i loved it for the first two weeks
i've tried a few different primer
after wearing it for a couple of weeks
it's been a couple months
washed it off after less than 5 minutes
went blotchy red after just a few minutes
it took a few hours for my face to stop burning
the cooling affect until like ten minutes later it looked like i had an acid peel gone wrong
or at least for me
well, it has been a few weeks now.
i used it for few more days just to confirm that it was the cream that was causing it
at least in the beginning
after the first couple times of using this
we've all had those nights where we're exhausted
i just finished my first jar after a few months of use
during the spring time
after 2 months of regular application
after four solid months of twice-daily application
the spots were not removed after several months of using this treatment
this was about a month
night for almost three months
cleansed for the next 2-3 days or so
just move past these
four-stars for that.
tried it out in the span of a week
i could tell a difference from using this after three days
it took a couple weeks to get my skin back to normal
the first few minutes are really intense- almost too intense
i tried it several times
even several days later
i feel like i lost several weeks of progress in minimizing my lines from another regimen
it went away after a couple of minutes
i ended up breaking out a few hours after
also that one side stopped dispensing over three weeks before the other side
my break outs cleared up a few days later
a couple years ago i tried ptr's camu camu moisturizer
even after several applications
the break out took a few weeks to totally go away
i'll give it a couple more days.
i've had it for a few weeks
seen no results after 2 months.
it really lasts for a few times of use.
i invested in a jar a few months ago
however it has been almost 3 weeks
after several minutes it drys up
when i first started using this about 2 months ago
two days later my face was covered in tiny bumps
after using it once daily for three consecutive days it began to break my skin out from dryness
night for two months
this cream made me broke out after trying out for a few weeks
she has been using it for couple months now
i tried this cream for a few weeks.
the problem came about 5 minutes later
i spent the next hour with horribly running
night for a month now
-breakouts for first two weeks
however this product lasted me 2 weeks
at least that´s my first impression
1 pump every morning for 1 month
after just a couple days use i developed pimples
i tried it a few more times
the bottle lasted me 2.5 months.
after a few days it broke me out on my nose
it also lasted me a long time.
i didn't see any results after using it consistently for a few months
no change using this after about 6 weeks
it took years off by smoothing
smooth a few fine lines i have
i tried for two weeks and saw no difference.
after two weeks only i had had enough.
have only been using it for a couple weeks
will post another review in another two weeks if i note a marked improvement
it goes bad within three months
three out of four hardened in the tube before i could use them
expired into this gross brown goo within a few months
only left it on for about 30 seconds so perhaps it would have been worse if i left it on for the full minute
i've used it every three days for two weeks
a couple week's use and still no different.
havent finished it in several months
just started using this product for two days
tired it for 2 weeks
there was no improvement in my skin after using if for three months too
have more than half bottle left
even after trying each variation for at least 2-3 weeks at a time
the bottle is nearly empty now
you can put your moisturizer on just a minute later
it fixes everything within days
it lasted almost 5months which was great!
it has been so long since the last time i saw acnes on my cheeks
had to wash off about 3 hours later because the smell never goes away
i didn't notice any difference after several uses
took it back after a few days of using it.
off for about 5 months now
i've had this cleanser for about 2 months now
i tried this cleanser for a few weeks.
within the first 2 weeks of use
sadly after applying it every night for over a month
i used this for a few months
twice a day for 3 weeks.
the first few times
i broke out badly a few days after adding it to my regimen
i've tried this for a few nights now.
few months is all it lasts
tried it for 3months!!
been in it only for two weeks.
well i've been using this for almost 2 weeks now
this is a three times a week kinda mask
i could feel my face getting tight after a few minutes
for the first few days, it did work for me.
after using it for about a month now day
it's been a couple of weeks
after just one use
the pump broke a few weeks in
had to return it the next day
after less than a week
nearly close to all makeup
only have the beginning of crows feet
i've had this for a couple weeks
i waited about 45 minutes
after a bit more than a month
after 3 months of daily use
it lasted me under two weeks
after that amount of time
any effect of course only lasted a few couple of hours
when i removed it later
within 2 days of using however
after a few applications of this
i wrote a review a few months ago
3 days after i had stopped using this
my pores are clogged from just a few days of using this product
i've had this cream for three months now.
i tried a few more nights
i tried it every night for two months
at least until this jar is gone
imagine this will last a long while.
i got several samples of these with my most recent purchase
and 16 days from my wedding none the less!
i waited few weeks later then use this again
a few of the other nighttime masks
using a few times a week for three weeks it started breaking me out terribly
as soon as i stopped using it my skin returned to normal within a few days
tried a sample a few days ago
been using this product for few weeks
eighty nine dollars is a lot of money for something that doesn't work
after another several uses
it did absolutely nothing for my crows feet after using it twice a day for 2 weeks
night for over 1 month
at least in the short term
about 3 weeks now i think
i tried it for about 2 weeks
i've only been using for a couple weeks
tried it before for almost a month.
or live with the fine lines that just started appearing over the past year
she's already gone through two bottles
it is now the last week of december
that only lasted for about ten minutes
it only last 4 weeks
it lasted me about 2 weeks of daily use.
saw no difference after using for 2 weeks
i returned this product after using for 5 weeks
after the two months
especially in the first half hour
2 to 3 days later my skin started feeling bumpy
it has gotten oily just a few hours after using it
all my issues cleared up within 2 weeks
then cleared up for a few days
i still have that acne and it's been two weeks.
despite having this product for over a year
using it everyday in my routine for six months
it lasted about 4 months with daily use i must add
i tried this a couple of times
after 2 weeks i still have a few of the blemishes
i've had this cleanser for about 2 weeks now
after a few consecutive days my skin looked dull
i tried it a few years ago
the first two weeks were amazing
its lasted me about 2 weeks for the small jar
been using it for a few months now
have been using this cream for at least a couple of months
after three weeks of trial
took photos every few days in similar lighting to compare
i waited about 10 minutes
however, after 2 weeks, i notice something odd.
it broke my skin out after two days of use.
a couple of months into the product use
have been using it a few weeks
i've tried a few face oils
the first 2 weeks were fine
i used it every night for a few months
i started using this product 6 months ago
this bar dried out my face completely within the first three days of using it
the first couple of times using this was fine.
after a couple of days my face would smell like chemicals
peekee in the morning maybe once every couple weeks
still have half of a bar left after 6 months of using
after one week of use
after about a week of use
added this into my routine for three days
three days later i had to return it
after several months using it i unfortunately haven't noticed any difference in my skin
lines on my forehead that weren't there two months ago
this happened a few days ago
two hours after application
did it's work first couple of days
used it for a few days
tried it several times
failed to remove any eye makeup after several rounds
a half weeks with no improvement at all
you can tell the difference in a couple minutes
after using it for 4 weeks
i tried it several different times just to give it a chance
i tried it a few times.
the past five years it really has gone down hill on quality
the only positive i can share is that the product absorbs well after a few minutes
now that i've been using it for a couple of weeks
picked this up a month or two ago because my pores were out of control
after the two days before that ran out
after using this for a few days
after about seven days of continued use
this dries in just a few seconds
i still have almost half the jar left
i used it 5 times already for the past three weeks
i recommended leaving it on for less than an hour like i did
i just tried couple of times from the set
here we are five days later
i’ve used this more than a few times
left it on for ten minutes
i couldn't last for more than 2 minutes
after just one use
less than five minutes later i had to take it off because my skin felt like it was on fire
after a few days, my face still has small bumps.
tried it a few times
after 5 minutes of it on my face
bright red for the next few hours
to leave this on my face for about 5 minutes
i took a break for three days
it's been over two weeks
the first few days of using it was good
bottle lasted me about 3 months.
i've only been using it about 3 weeks
been using it for three days
i got for a month now
a few weeks ago i finally decided to phase it out of my skin care routine
while it worked well for the first few applications
it really dried my skin out over the next few
i tried it for a little over a month
after 2 weeks i haven't seen any miracles
has lasted about 40days
it's been about 3 weeks since i've been using.
i used this for several months before finally giving up
does nothing for dark circles after 2 months of daily use
the product has made no changes in the three weeks of use
within the next few weeks there will be a remarkable difference
it did last a long time.
it has been a month
the stinging went away after a few seconds
after faithfully using this product for nearly 3 months
i tried this cleanser a few years ago because it came in one of my glossyboxes
is peeling in several places
everything seemed perfectly fine until a few hours later i realized that my face was stinging
it's been almost 2 weeks now
like two months of daily use
the whiteheads disappeared in two days
the next day however
i've had the reaction for four days now
a few hours later it will start to dry up
have been using it for about 2 weeks
after about a month of use i've noticed a couple of problems
have several of their masks
still tried it for a few days
i think i gave it a few hours
it only lasts 3 months after opening
i just bought this a few months ago in a set.
this thing resulted in one within a few days
three days in a row caused a major breakout
after a few days i started noticing a couple of breakouts
after walking around the store a few times pondering
it is still slightly sticky 6 hours later
the smell disappears after a few minutes
i've only used this a few times so far
had to give it few days off
s where i've been getting a few age spots
i tried a few times
a few in places i never normally break out
after 5 days, i had to stop.
a month later i am still recovering.
not even 30 seconds later
after using it a few weeks
i ended up returning this product after a few weeks
after a few days, i didn't see any difference.
the first couple days i tried this
have been using them for the past 15 years
several hours after i first tried this product
waited a few days later to try it again
after using it for months
i tried only for a few weeks.
i gave this product several days' use
using it 2-3 times a week for almost a month
i tried it for a few weeks
after 2 months of use i do see some fading
have not had a major breakout in months
each time i used it i found a new zit a few hours later
within 2 hours my makeup was no longer matte.
help keep my foundation in place where it will normally break up after a few hours
which i've been using for several months
some reviews said after a few weeks
i just started on accutane a month ago.
i started using this balm about a week ago.
spend just a few dollars more
is that it has been about 3 weeks
i did notice that after using it for about a month i have more whiteheads than i've ever had

didn't really notice a big difference upon waking after using it several times
which did take about 7 months or more
i broke out for two weeks all over
that fades after about 10 minutes
acne for many years
the bottle only lasted about 4 weeks
i gave it several attempts
after using it for almost 3 months
gave it several chances--same issue.
after two weeks of using both
when i combined the three bottles together
3 months later i haven't noticed anything different
for me at least
i gave it two months
after about 3 months of use, i have to stop.
've been using it for a couple of weeks now
it also caused my makeup to come off within 3-4 hours
s look ten years younger with this thing on
the smell persists for hours at minimum
after a few weeks my skin has become so oily
maybe three or four pumps
rolled off my skin several hours after putting on
while it does help to mattify the skin for a few hours
after 3 days of using it, i had to return it.
three hours into my work day
hours later you're oily again
returned after a few uses.
the best that happens is a few hours
i began to have oily skin within the past year or so
i've had the tube for less than a year
probably has only been opened for 6 months
used it for a few weeks
i stopped using it after a couple weeks because it pills up so much
it lasts maybe one hour before i have to blot
you can only see a difference for a couple of hours
there was no difference after a month
been using for over 2 weeks
was using it every couple days instead of my normal moisturizer
it takes a couple of minutes to sink in for me
i tried this out for two weeks
after two weeks of using this day
my skin was an oil slick after a couple hours
this happened about 4 days ago.
after a week or two
within the first few uses it broke my face out
i've tried it for a couple weeks now
i applied every night for a couple of months
i've used this almost every other day for the last two months
it took more than 2 weeks for recovery
i tried it a few more times
i returned it not even a week later.
after only a day or two
then a couple months later tried this cream again
i began using this cream about three months ago
never really sinks in i usually end up taking it off a few hours later
after using this for the past week
after a few times of having to do this cumbersome task
after two weeks my face continued to get worst.
have been using this product for the last week
tried it for a few days
the blue one the next
for weekend no makeup days
i've had this for over 6 months now
've been using this for a few months
after only wearing for a few hours
i tried it several months apart to see if it got any better
after a week of using this every morning
tends to separate after about an hour
within a few days after use
for a good hour after applying
less than a minute for me
with it being on less than the recommended 5 minutes
will try a thinner layer later on this week
i tried it a couple times
only kept me matte for just a few minutes.
i used this product for a few weeks
i just tried this over the weekend

will pill later in the day.
the colder months are coming up
my skin was burning after only a few minutes
made my face red for several hours
after 2 weeks my skin is smoother.
lasted a couple days before my skin recovered
have been using this product for more then 2 weeks
night for 1 month with no improvements
however i am nearly 3/4 of the way through
it has been about 2 weeks that i have been using it
i used it close to every day for a few weeks
found there was at least 1/3 of the product remaining
've been using this once to twice a day for the last two months
after about an hour my face
my face is still a few days later :/ id be cautious if you have dry
i started to break out a few hours later
now that i haven't used it for a few days
but this product gave me several blemishes.
i did the first three treatments three days in a row as recommended
my results did not last for 24 hours
i started using it a little over a month ago
definitely evens skin tone after a few weeks
however just when i started to notice a change 4 weeks in
the bottle lasted me a little more than a month
i kept it on for a few more minutes to see if the irritation would calm down
the next week or
within two days of trying this
the next morning i had some new pimples :(
after using for 4 nights in a row
i tried a few different kinds
it takes a few minutes to sink in
i tried drying his product for as long as thirty minutes
even after using every so often for a couple months
would've given it four stars
by week two my eyes were very smooth
besides it doing nothing for under my eyes it also only lasted two weeks
it only lasted the two weeks
my under eye area calmed down a few days after i stopped using it
makeup for a few days uuntil my face calmed down
i used it again a few months after
5 weeks in it just stopped
after 2 month i have already started my second treatment
it leaves me very red for the next 36-48 hours
laser for two weeks
so seven weeks total between the two lasers
then it died after a few weeks
was using it for a few days when i realized that my face had started breaking out
in 2 weeks my skin was smooth
i returned it by week two of use.
i've used the miracle worker moisturizer for a few years
after two weeks i noticed dark spots
after 5 days it was still stinging once applied
after having it on for a few seconds
after using it for just 2 weeks
the next day i had breakouts
thankfully, it went away after a couple of days.
after about two weeks of using this my under eyes are completely dried out
i used a couple samples of this for several days in a row
tossed it within two days because of the fragrance
had this product for a month
it got dry all over again after just a couple minutes
for over two weeks
the dark circles are nearly gone
however i've been using it for a couple of weeks now
that lasted only an hour
i been using it for 3 weeks now.
however, after two days of use my skn is on fire!
i tried it for two nights
have been using this cream for about two months now every morning
after three weeks of use
after only a few minutes on my skin
by the next morning
dryness in a few places which didn't stop until i limited use to a just a couple times a week
been using for a few weeks.
i ended up getting red spots after using it for a few days
it's only been a couple of weeks
already broken after just two weeks use.
stopped using on my face after a few days.
i've had the product for less than a month i'm a fifth of the way through the bottle already
night for over a month
seen very few results with no long term benefits
even from over 2 weeks of use
in fact i had a few more pimples
the first two bottles have lasted me 3 months each
the last one had a different smell
so while touching my skin a couple hours later to check its lasting hydrating benefits
for a total of about 8 times
but three minutes in, my skin was burning.
it burned so much i couldn't even have it on the full ten minutes
after trying it for a few months
wait a few minutes before applying makeup
after a few seconds it gets very hard to spread
a totally let down a few minutes after applying
i've tried it a few times this week with different serums
it seemed to almost separate from my face.
night for almost two weeks now
didn't realize it was this until i used it several days in a row
smooth skin with a few hyperpigmention spots here
actually caused me to break out in a few places
i tried this for weeks
i've only been here a week
a few days ago i went back to my old facial wash
i broke out all over my face after using this for a couple weeks
after about a week i noticed more
kept on for a month
after a few weeks i realized it was just breaking me out
after using it for 2 weeks
the first month i had no issues
still have over half of it left
didn't notice any difference after using it several times
feels a little bit tingle at first five minutes
it only last for an hour
the next few times it essentially did nothing
then twice a week for a month
have been using this for weeks
it took more than 2 weeks to go away.
day for over a month
after using for two weeks i have not seen a difference in appearance
decided to give it another chance a few days later
let it sink in for a few minutes
after using this product for several weeks i noticed that not only had my skin not improved
after using a couple of days in a row i did notice a glow
i tried it for several weeks
i only noticed about a 10% improvement within the first week then its efficacy kind of just tapered off after that
unfortunately it caused breakouts within a few days
after a break of a couple of weeks after my skin had cleared
after 6 weeks of daily use i saw no difference
after just half a day
after 4 months there was no improvement
it would look patchy even if waiting a few minutes for it to dry first
after using it for a few days
the first few days i loved it
it was fun to use the first few times
for me at least
been over the moon about them
after 5 mins most of the foam is disappeared
barely lasted me a couple months
after using this product for a few weeks i have seen no difference
i used this for a few weeks
the last few weeks i've been thinking to myself that the wrinkles around my eyes look worse
didn't work for me, gave it several months.
four weeks of use everyday and no improvement.
started using it every night 3 days later.
three weeks later and this has done nothing.
i've given over couple of months now
i've purchased it several times
used it for about two weeks in two dark spots i have on my face
i typically use it every day for a couple weeks
then i pick it up again in a few months
in the last few months i noticed age spots
two weeks to be exact
tried out two months... no signs of improvement.
my face is still recovering even after weeks in use
i didn't realize until a month later with no improvement
i've had it for two months now
been using for about 3 weeks
patchy skin in only a 3 day span
after about a month of use
at least as of late
this made it ten times worse
for awhile they worked (about 6 months).
have been using it for almost 2 months
later bought another murad product ever weeks later to give it a second chance
fortunately this fades after a few minutes
i used this for several weeks before returning it
after a couple of evenings of continuous use
fever for three days
the two times i've tried to put makeup over it
the container has already lasted 8 months
