thjs has got to be the worst moisturizer i have used
to me personally i try my best to avoid using products with alcohol in the first 6 ingredients
so far, not my fave.
it wouldn't be the worst product
the biggest things that made me stop using it
not the best to be honest.
this okay but not the best.
it works best when i put it on a while before makeup application
it is the first ever moisturizer that made me break out
my biggest complaint is the smell
the worst thing of all
let's start off by saying that josie maran milk is one of my favorite facial products ever in life
this product left the weirdest film on my face.
the worst cream i ever tried
i don't like the feeling of product on top of the skin
i'll stick with that one for the most part
that's the closest i could compare it to.
i've only ever had them on my nose
it caused me to have the worst
it was an average moisturizer at best.
only to be met with the craziest of breakouts
which is really the best way to use it
aesthetics is the biggest thing going for this product
overall: this is a novelty item at best
it just wasn't the best moisturizer for me.
this was one of the worst moisturizers i have tried from sephora
the worst beauty product i have ever used!
boscia ones being my favorites
the most horrible product that has ever touch my face
this product was the worst face cleanser i have ever tried
afterwards it is the worst my face as literally have ever felt
this might be best for oily skin.
the worst part is that it has a powerful
after 20 years of using the best moisturizer on the planet
and it was not the best idea.
the biggest disappointment for me is how much it stings my eyes
this was the single worst thing i have ever used from sephora
when hydration is the biggest thing needed
i really don't adore the current over-the-top highlight
my favorite part of the product
my biggest issue with this though
might be best to use as a nighttime waste riser only because of this
i think it works best combined with other products
t is not the best moisturizer
the original formula was my all-time favorite.
best way i could describe it
that is probably my favorite part
the best way to use it to mix it with face oils
wasn't the best at removing makeup
it was the best product in the set
it's easily one of the best mascara i've ever tried
i figured it is best to use 1 a day or every other day
this is the strangest smelling beauty product i've ever used
my biggest issue though is the fragance
overall i have no desire to use it ever
this is perhaps one of the worst moisturizers i have ever used
this is the worst moisturizer.
the worst part is
the biggest problem is it gives me monster zits.
not the best i have tried for puffy eyes
this is the smartest face cream formulation i have ever seen
it is not the best i have tried many better creams in my recent days
this is by far the worst
this product may preform best as a primer
at best, it made no difference.
if i had to choose i'd say it worked best as a primer
this is the worst product i've ever bought.
this eye cream really was one of the worst ones since i used it for 5 weeks
the fact that it is a 2016 best of beauty winner
this is probably best suited to be used by itself with a bit of setting powder
best used for its light effects
one of the best smelling moisturizers in my opinion
if i didn't already have a favorite
this is not 1 of clinique's best cleansers.
not the best exfoliatior/cleanser.
overexfoliating is one of the biggest skin care mistakes people make
this is just not the best moisturizer or the best primer so
the worst part about it is that itstarts to peel off
the smell isn't my favorite
not the best moisturizer for my skin
this left the weirdest texture on my face.
the worst part about this product is it's price tag
honestly this was my least favorite
this product would be best as a primer as opposed to a moisturizer
an oily t-zone are my best friends at all times in the summer
this is the stickiest moisturizer i have ever used
this one is probably my least favorite
it says it's best for this type of skin
this is going to have to be my least favorite
the worst part was how difficult it was to peel off
but the worst part by far was peeing it off.
really this mask was the worst i've used honestly
love origins products but this was the worst.
it is not the easiest way to remove your eye make up either
this one isn't my favorite
this one was my favorite
the worst part is it smells awfulllllllllllll
with my combo skin i don't know if this is the best option
it's basically a primer but worst.
it is the worst moisturizer i've ever tried
dont buy this worst skin care product i have ever used
one of the worst masks i've get tried.
it is sticky and the chunks are the worst.
its always been my favorite skin care br
even after using my strongest moisturizer to try to fix it
this may not be the best product for you
however this one is not a favorite.
this is the scariest eye cream i've ever used
definitely not the greatest
farmacy has the cutest packaging
my skin is bad as ever
it didn't do the greatest job at removing the makeup
it was the worst facemask i have ever used
the biggest wow is the magnet
this is the messiest waste of time.
it wasn't the worst or the best.
it's perhaps the worst moisturizer i've tried
not the easiest to blend out
maybe this works best for someone with actual rosacea
this balm has given me the worst acne
this was the worst one i've tried
that is the best eye liner i have ever used
am currently on the hunt for my favorite eye cream
that wasn't the worst thing
it's not the worst i've ever used
it's not the best
it's a primer at best.
have found they work best for my combination skin type
for the longest time i've been trying to figure out what's causing my conjested pores
it's literally the worst thing i've ever used to remove makeup
you have to use a ton to get off even the lightest makeup
this one is the worst.
this one is not my favorite
this was by far the greasiest cream i have ever used
it goes to show expensive isn't always best.
this is the worst moistureizer i have ever tried
i wish i liked this more because i have the worst skin
this was my favorite part of the two step process
the bar is my worst nightmare
coconut oil since less product works best for me
probably best used as a subtle highlight or highlight primer
i think it would be best used underneath makeup
my largest problem area
it's not the greatest scent
my smashbox primer on top
my skin is back to the most rough texture ever
going back to my old favorite.
i've only ever had a reaction to one product
this is at the top
on top of my makeup
on top of it all
this by far is one of the most disappointing products i've ever purchased at sephora
perhaps it would be best worn layered with other products
it's one of the greasiest moisturizers i have ever used
i loved this cleanser at first.
this has been the worst facial cleanser that i've ever bought at sephora
this was my first ever splurge on a face cream
also the ingredients are not the best
my favorite thing to splurge on is a great moisturizer
my biggest complaint is the fragrance is really strong
this is the most disappointing product ever.
i must say that this cream by far is the worst cream i have ever put on my face
it was the most disappointing moisturizer i've ever used
i only recommend this if no makeup is worn on top
not the best moisturizer but also not the worst.
the best way to use this was really suddzing it up with water first in the h
the cleanser was my favorite product of the three
this was my least favorite
my least favorite part of this product is that my face felt sticky
worst part of this product is that it seems to draw the humidity right out of the air
this is not the best choice for oil-control hydration
overall it wasn't my favorite
it wasn't my favorite.
not my favorite moisturizer.
maybe not the best for this purpose.
not only was the lightest shade wayyy to dark
alternating skin care (for me) is the best thing.
i couldn't believe that it was the worst of the worst items i've paid for
then hope for the best
the worst product ever.
this product gave me the worst breakouts
i wish you the best of luck!
not the greatest primer either
so many youtubers raved about it being the best primer ever
had the biggest pimples i've ever had in my life
saw the biggest white cast over my face
this new re formulation is the most disgusting thisng i have ever put on my skin
this was the most expensive makeup remover i ever bought
this is the worse dropper i've ever used
jart + products however this is one of the worst products i have ever tried in any beauty line
that was the worst idea ever
this made me break out in the worst way
good genes is still my all time favorite
gel is the best option for cooling
the worst eye cream i've ever tried in my life.
you'll have the best cleanser ever
i find i get best results by rubbing it over my face
the biggest issue i have with it though
that seems to work best
this product was one of the worst cleansers i have ever used
the smell isn't the greatest
firming was the best one
even the best skin can be better
i decide to buy this worst mistake ever this mask don't work the money
unfortunately this wouldn't be at the top of my list
although not the worst serum i've used
even the cheapest ones
super disappointing as this was my favorite cleanser
this was a good product, but not my favorite.
it leaves the nastiest film
its not my favorite
for the most part
it's the cheapest moisturizer i've gotten
this is among the worst moisturizers.
the best thing about this is that it is a light weight moisturizer
worst part after washing my face
this product was a favorite of mine
but the worst of it is the major pillage.
biggest waste of money i've spent on a moisturizer that's supposed to mattify
this product is the best i've found for my oily skin
i think it would be best to use this during the colder months
i must say that this moisturizer is the worst one i've ever tried
this is the worst moisturizer i have ever used.
most use this at night.
i think that it would be best to use at night i work with makeup all the time being a freelance makeup artist
however this is best to be used at night
maybe best for mature skin.
i got the worst headache from the smell of it still on my h
this is the most disappointing product i've ever bought from sephora
the worst product i've ever put on my poor face
this used to be my favorite moisturizer back in 2006
this is literally the worst facial product i've ever bought
this made it worst
this product works best perhaps after a deep cleansing
not the best moisturizer out there
it is not their best
i tried my best to blemish the acne away
not the best fresh product i have tried.
this mask is ok at best.
one of the best moisturizers i've used
think that is the best moisturizer i ever used
my favorite milk cleanser is no longer stocked
it smells like the worst detergent
the worst thing is after you use it to wash the face
the one i hated the most
worst cleanser ever tried.
this stuff is the worst!
the applicator isn't the best
it's not the best or most convenient use
one of my favorite br
it was one of the most gentle acne treatments i have ever used
makeup goes on top well
not the best it did moisturize
my favorite night cream is the origins vitazing is my favorite
it was okay a best.
has the worst chemical smell ever after a few seconds
the "soothing gel cleanser" was the furthest thing from soothing to my skin
the best for my skin is 20%
i really wouldn't hand his to my worst enemy!
this used to be the best product ever
most of the clay is on my h
this could be the best cleanser ever made
this was the worst moisturizer i have ever used in the sense that it made me such a greaseball
not your best work glamglow
which has been my all time favorite
which is the best i have ever tried
definitely not the best option for normal to combination skin
it is the worst product i've ever tried.
i liked the cleanser the best out of the whole set
it is the best i 've used
not the worst, not the best.
it wasn't my favorite
my face broke out worst than it ever has
this was not my favorite.
this was the best moisterizer i used for under my make up
but the worst thing is the smell.
this is the worst cleanser i have ever tried.
it only made it worst
the biggest problem with this product is that it is nearly impossible to use any bb cream
telling me it's the absolute best in the entire store
it was the greatest product ever to help dark circles
this was recommended by a salesperson at sephora as being one of the best selling eye creams
the smell isn't my favorite
least effective eye cream i have ever tried.
one of the worst eye creams i have ever used.
i only found it average at best.
this is probably my least favorite korres product i've tried
i don't have the best sense of smell
it was not the best moisturizer for me
it has the worst consistency ever
this is definitely not my favorite
even worst was that it really burned
it was the strangest feeling.
this is my first review ever!!
i know this is a cult favorite for oily/combination skin
this is truly the worst moisturizer.
it is not the best product i have ever used.
best yet has spf
this one ranks as worst
best product they make
but is is legendary?
my biggest need is for a makeup remover
yet when it came to removing even the lightest makeup
one of the best moisturizers i've ever used in my life
its not the best cleanser out there
my favorite sephora girl ever recommended this
it was worst when i put foundation on

it is the stickiest cream i've ever put on my body
all at the top of the ingredients
s down one of the best eye creams i've ever used
since shiseido's ultimune eye power infusing eye concentrate is one of my absolute favorite products
it's not the worst moisturizer
for the most part
i love most of the shideido products
this is the worst product i ever used
for the most part
estée lauder in the gold jar has still been the best so far
applied my favorite light foundation on top
it's actually the worst moisturzier that i've ever used
worst of all it makes my whiteheads even more prominent
this one is not the best of them
this is the worst cream with spf i have ever had.
trying to spread it as best as i could
so far best eye product i've come across
while this is the best night cream i've ever used
it's one of the best
this is definitely the worst mask i have ever used
the new packaging is the worst

sephora has the world's best return policy
it is the worst moisturizer i have used in terms of causing my foundation to "pill"
it's one of the worst moisturizers i've ever used
my acne is the worst it has ever been in my life

best of luck for whoever does buy it
the foam works best alone on my skin which is combination
this is the first time i've ever had this problem
worst part, it didn't even clear up the acne.
im not the biggest fan of clinique
i think it actually made them worst
much i had the worst reaction to this product my skin became very red ball full of pimples
this is the first night cream i've ever used.
now my skin is the clearest it's ever been
my skin looked the worst its ever looked
the redness solutions products work best
i also started to get the worst acne
i always test a new product on one side of my face compared with my current favorite
the texture isnt the best
definitely the grossest thing i have ever used on my face
it's the worst money i've ever spent on a beauty product
the worst exfoliator i have ever tried.
this is the worst moisturizer ever!
i like it- but it's not my favorite.
the worst thing about it is its disgusting old gr
still on the search for my favorite
within a week i had the worst break out of my life
most eye cream do that
gave me the worst reaction.
that's about the best comment i can make for this product
i think this product is best for people who have normal skin
not my favorite wash
decided to buy the best of perricone kit
the best part of that "package" was the eye treatment
no one ever answers
this is easily the worst face cream i have gotten since subscribing to play over a year ago
not the best for me but better.
it works for most of the day
this is by far one of the greasiest creams i have ever tried
this has the strangest smell
i like it best at night
it is one of the nicest smelling products i've ever tried
it is one of the best masks i've ever tried.

this was the best face cream ever
sadly this is my least favorite clinique product.
this is one of the worst eye creams i ever tried
in time it became worst
'm not the best judge of this product
this is not the best line filling cream out there
hope for the best
not the best for oily skin
where everyone brought at least ten of their favorite cosmetics products
i do want to point out that this is one of the favorite moisturizers of one of the women at the party
my biggest gripe with this cleanser is that it has silicone in it
but the cap on this tube is the worst.
t's not my favorite for everyday use
it isn't the best make-up remover
my favorite part of this moisturizer is the packaging
what i like best about this is the container.
perhaps play or a sephora favorites kit
not a bad product, but far from my favorite.
worst $$$ ive ever spent.
which works best for my skin
this is by far the worst cleanser i have ever used
it's not the worst, but it's not the best.
this serum is the worst
the biggest complain i have is the dispenser
s down the most poorly designed product i've ever purchased
this has by far been my least favorite
of all the cleansing oil i've used this was the worst
this line gave me the worst breakouts of my life
the enzyme treatment is my favorite right now.
somebody should get fired for the worst packaging ever
my biggest issue with this is how it leaves my skin
the active radiance is my least favorite thus far
my skin has gotten worst as i get older
i think my biggest mistake with this moisturizer is that i trusted it to be my every need moisturizer
the worst part is the smell.
i received a deluxe sample of this as i had wanted to try it for the longest time
this is the worst smelling product i have ever used
it's definitely not the greatest smell
this is the worst smell ever!
i think my main purpose is best to just keep my skin moisturizer
not the best from lancome..
i am still on a quest to find the best eye cream!
the biggest size work well.
by far my worst purchase of a life time.
my dark circles worst
it used to be my fave thing ever
received the worst acne breakout i've had in years
this was the worst yet
one of the worst products i have used
i like this but it is not my favorite.
tatcha by far has been the best
i feel like this made things worst.
the more i used it the worst my face got like breaking out alot of what head
worst money ever spent
probably best for summer.
my previous favorite eye gel
not my favorite smelling product.
dare i say it makes it worst
this is the worst.
this may be best for oily skin
shiseido products are the best
best bet is to find creams without the alcohol.
it may be the greatest eye cream in the world
the most disappointing product i ever bought.
the best way i can describe the smell is dead fish
so probably not the best for combination / oily skin
biggest flaw is the smell
boscia is my favorite skin product line
my biggest problem with this cleanser is that it is very thick
this is the worst thing i have ever purchased
this is one of the very best skin creams i have ever used
it was the best product i had found.
i recently got a sample of this creme since i am trying to find a new face creme favorite for my skin
this is some of the worst stuff i have ever used on my face
set my rosacea to the worst flare i've had in a long time
this is the worst i've ever used.
i never get acne, ever.
the worst creme i have bought by far.
i never had acne or breakouts ever!
the best part about this oil is the smell.
my biggest complaint about this product is that is made me breakout
try another cream this one is overrated
has ever helped with my dark circles
the best way to describe this is a combination between a primer
the white lines if leaves on went on worst
the best thing i can say about this "sorbet" is that the scent is non-offensive
workong my way through each eye cream/gel to find the best one
it wasn't the best product out there
this eye cream is the worst cream in my eye cream history
the best thing i can say about this product is the packaging is beautiful
even though i'm convinced this is the best eye cream out there
caudalie happens to be one of my top 5 brands.
ingredients at the top being the most concentrated in the product
this is not the worst product
the former pore minimizer refining lotion was the best oil-free primer i have ever used
i called perricone to check best if used by date
provided the best possible results
the worst skin care product i have ever used
algenist is probably great for most
this was a decent moisturizer at best.
wouldn't recommend this product as a top choice.
not the best smell
not the best eye cream i've ever used
they have some of the best products on the market
leaving it alone is the best
this product comes closest to working
this was my first ever cleansing oil
the dispenser isn't the best design
this is one of the worst cleansers i have ever tried
this truly is the worst cleansing oil that i've ever tried
worst cleansing oil i've tried
worst product i've ever used.
not the best ingredients
greasiest moisturizer i have ever had the misfortune of using
best part about this is the cute packaging.
truly average at best.
most of their products have been amazing for me
i've had dark circles for the longest
which is my biggest concern in eye care at this point
is that it works best on mature skin
may be the spf but it's not my favorite.
for the most part
yikes - not the best henriksen product.
not sure its the best
tried this because i love the murad ultimate moisture face cream
which was my favorite
they work best and there is no odor.
best factor of this cream-- zero irritation!
not the best product for the price.
after using it for couple of days unfortunately it made my skin breakout in a worst way possible
not the worst reaction i've had
the worst part is that is triggered major acne
that describes it best
this is by far the worst face product i've ever tried
which isn't the worst part
the worst part is the smell
the worst smelling cream i have ever tried.
that's the best way to describe it.
it was the worst smelling product i have ever smelled
its not the best either
it's supposed to be one of the best of the best!
the worst part for me is that my skin actually looks courser
also reading paula's choice website the jar is not the greatest way to preserve the ingredients from what i got from the review :
the thing i dislike most is the fragrance.
this is the best product of the three
consistency wise not really my favorite
this is the second eye cream i've ever given a try
this is one of the worst cleansers i have ever used :
this is one of the best one i have came across
not my favorite face wash
it actually made my skin worst
this is the one they felt was best for my skin type
this was the worst face cleanser i've ever gotten
using this made it worst
can't say this is favorite
the biggest problem i have with this mask is how difficult it is to wash off
this is the first eye cream i've ever tried
its only made my break outs worst
that is the best one i have ever used
this has to be the worst product i've ever used
you used to be the best skin line
the requirement for best results is morning
this one is not my favorite
i don't think using it every day is best
unfortunately this caused the biggest break out :
best to use over night
after one of my best friends raved about this product for months
i must say they have the worst
cheapest packaging of any br
sephora stopped selling my favorite serum so this was my first attempt at finding a new favorite
it seems i'll still be on the lookout for the best
might not be the best c
not the best not the worst
i realllly wanted to like this since it's supposed to be a cult favorite
the worst part was that i would still have makeup on my face
is not the best
would only recommend using this on top of a moisturizer
this one is top notch in my book
it really is the best.
product has a strong rose scent which is not my favorite
rodial cleansing balm is by far the best
but the worst part is the aerosol.
one of the worst products i've probably ever tried only because i couldn't get past the aerosol
not the best by any means
it's average at best
we actually manufacture one of the most famous marine based
to make matters worst it smells horrible
is honestly the most rancid smelling cream i've ever tried
not sure this would be my favorite product though
it had the worst smell of mildew that i've ever experienced in a beauty product
the biggest drawback is the awful scent.
i wish i'd just gotten my favorite to begin with
this was my least favorite.
that being said it's not the greatest clay mask out there
worst part about this product is the smell
i found it best to use 1 pump
this cleanser was one of the top things on my list
one of the worst i've ever used
the smell of this product is probably the worst smelling skin care product i have ever used
at best a mediocre temporary filler.
it is also named a one of the best products on paula's choice
my biggest issue with this is that it did not moisturize my face at all
this is probably the best facial moisturizer i've ever used
this is my first review ever
maybe this is best suited for those who don't wear makeup
this isn't my favorite mask.
the best is to use a fluid instead of a cream on your skin
who is well trusted
it is really a light undereye consealer best used without other products
and worst thing i've bought so far.
i can deal with a tiny breakout while it soothes the most epic breakout i have ever experienced
after a week of use my usually clear skin had it's worst breakout in years
this may be the best product in the world for your skin
made the redness worst
it has a strange smell not the best
the smell is not the best
the worst part of all is i cannot wear this cream under my foundation
is the best way i can describe
this line gave me the worst breakouts of my life
not better or worst than anything i have tried before
works best if you use 2x daily
the best part of this product is what it doesn't have it in
worst "tingle" i've ever gotten from a face mask.
i believe this has been the biggest disappointment of a product ever
sk-ii has always been in the top list when it comes to good skin products
the best thing about it is the smell.
this was definitely the worst mask ever
after my skin settled i've learnt that this works best for me as a spot treatment on my tzone
was really hoping for the best
the new formula may not be the greatest for sensitive combination skin
i'll probably move to the a perfect world moisturizers since i have the rest of the collection
the worst skin care product i've ever used
fresh most of the time
it also does not smell the greatest.
that's the worst part about beauty products
moisturizers that i would of liked to use on top
it faded some of the darkest ones quite well
which is where my acne is the worst
the worst part of it is that it had the strangest pilling/balling up texture every time i applied it
the worst product ever.
this has to be the worst eye product i've ever used
i think this is my least favorite
this is not my favorite product
honestly not the best
t's best used at night
the worst thing was that it dried my lips
i would not give this product to my worst enemy.
it was the worst mistake
the worst product in sephora
it has the worst smell from a product i've ever used
this is the worst sephora product i have ever bought
not my favorite moisturizer overall
by far is one of the most best smelling oils i've smelt
even my best moisturizer didn't help.
this has to be one of the worst face creams i have ever used
this is definitely not my favorite
the worst thing was
only made it worst
one of the best smelling face products ever.
also not the worst
should've known i'd have a problem since the first ingredient is dimethicone
which wasn't the best feeling
it did nothing for even the finest lines around eyes
probably one of the worst beauty products i have ever purchased
like the worst i've had in over a year
the worst of all it smells like bugspray
it's an average moisturizer at best
it actually got worst after using it
s far superior to this one
this is my favorite tata product i have tried so far
there needs to be a cleanser in between the biggest
may not be best for combination skin.
this is the best oil, and i have tried so many.
for the most part
i found its effectiveness was strongest at the beginning
i think this is best for someone who has oily skin
i believe i get best results when i take a hot shower at night
this bio-chemical retinol is the worst nightmare my skin had to endure
this is the worst micellar cleanser i've ever used
this would be best for using as a second cleansing step
they are a lazy girl's best friend.
it's probably not the best option
unfortunately it isn't the easiest eyeliner to remove
just not the greatest
on top of which it wasnt even a great moisturizer
this is probably my least favorite of any collection
it'd be best for younger skin
not the worst moisturizer out there
its not the best and it's not the worst.
honestly burns the worst i've ever felt
it has the stickiest
my favorite balm removes makeup
i wanted to try this product because it is famous for cleanser
actually one of the best i've had in a while
one of my least favorite smells
this is the worst cream that i have ever used.
i am the biggest supporter of lancôme
have been on the quest to find the best product for it
as well as reading recent reviews from beauty-experts that this product is the greatest thing to revolutionize skincare since
acne spots or what so ever
this cleanser is the worst it didn't take off my foundation at all
not the best, not the worst.
the best thing about this product was the aroma!
the tube it comes in is the worst
one of the worst anti aging creams i have ever used
best cream i've tried so far
t's dna was going to be the best product for me
skin started to look worst than before
this is the worst cleanser i hav ever used it just moved my makeup around my face instead of removing it
i wasn't the biggest fan of the scent
they caused the biggest bags ever
asking what the best eye cream would be for dark circles
i don't have the world's darkest circles
matter fact it made my dark circle go worst
is the best one out of all the algenist ones i have tried so far
perhaps the worst mask i've tried.
but for me, it was at best mediocre.
based on allure's best of beauty award
like i do with my other favorite cleansers
the pump was the worst thing i've ever seen
results are dismal at best.
my absolute favorite part is the smell.
this is the most dissapointing eye cream i have ever used
this eye cream is not a high performer
i'd say this is my least favorite glamglow mask.
the worst he has seen my skin in the past 3 years

this is not my favorite product by any means.
the overall impression is just okay at best
is actually best used over foundation

it is the furthest thing from hydrating
drying out my undereye area is the worst thing about it
for the most part
the best product i found is glamglow in the white bottle
this was the worst
this may be the worst product i have ever tried from sephora
the closest i've come to find is algenist
this is my least favorite mask from glamglow
the breaking out isn't even the worst part
this eye gel is the worst.
this was the stickiest gel ever.
this this cleansing oil was not the best i've used
in my opinion by far the best
leaves the worst smell on face
it's definitely not the best oil cleanser i've used
this was the worst cleanser i have ever used
my take is that this cleanser would be best for a two-step regimen
this is definitely the worst
it cleanses okay, but not the best.
this isn't the worst
this is nothing short of a moisturizer at best
this used to be my favorite melting cleanser
not the best cleaner
is this ever a big "

let's start with the worst thing about this product:it includes alcohol
benefit it one of my very faves
biggest waste of money it did nothing for me.
finger tip worked best for me
for the price, it's average, at best.
it would probably be best for you
this was the least favorite of the bunch
this is one of the top ingredients in some primers too
for the most part
best for a younger person
washed it off thinking this would be the best product ever
think its best to give it more time
it was the worst experience ive ever had with a facewash
best smelling cleanser i have ever used.
the second time i used it i started to get the worst irritation around my nose
my biggest problem with this product was the smell as it was not appealing
the biggest problem with this product is the smell
with no makeup on top
if you ever use this
not the greatest makeup remover
this is the worst product ever
the next day was the worst
except for the fact that it was just too dark since i'm literally the fairest shade in the word
the biggest problem was the color.
the next morning i had the worst breakouts
let's just get the worst thing about this for me out of the way
the biggest turn off for me is the smell
the worst part is that his serum smells horrible.
this is the worst product i've ever gotten from sephora
cleanser i have ever used
it seems like a gimmick at best.
you waste most of it
this is the first one ever to make my skin breakout
it remains on top of the skin
it isn't the worst
one of theeee worst under eye balms i've ever tried
i find it so hard to believe that the first top of the ingredients are natural
this one wasn't the best
this was the weirdest thing i think i have put on my face
this first aid beauty is among that category.
it would be best only at night.
oily or combo it may not be the best
no cleansing water should ever be the first
this almost made it worst
the worst combination ever
for the most part
and i put the finest layer on my face.
i loved this eye cream at first
it's not the most expensive eye cream i've ever used
for the most part this is a decent moisturizer.
honestly this is the worst cleanser i have ever used
as its mask counterpart is my favorite
gave it to my best friend with more oily skin
one of the worst cleansers ever
perhaps best for those with oily skin
algenist is my favorite skin care br
the worst part is that it really sits on top of your skin
it takes for ever to rub in
it wasn't the worst mask i've used
worst product i have ever purchased from sephora.
it's not my favorite cleanser
i didn't do the greatest job at removing makeup.
that's the nicest thing i can say about this
i will say that this is probably one of the best makeup removers i've ever used
this cleanser just worst one i have ever used.
had the strongest scent
this was my least favorite of the 3
this is the worst lotion i've ever purchased.
it's the worst product i've ever tried for oily skin
the essence is a win
unfortunately the scent they've chosen is not my favorite
no way i'd ever buy this.
this is seriously the worst mask i've tried before
this is their worst product
this is one of the cheapest oils
it isn't the best cleansing oil out there
it's definitely not the greatest
i don't know if it is the best for makeup removal
i believe castor is the oil in greatest concentration in this product
this cleanser wasn't the best choice for me.
this was the first cleansing oil i ever tried
my dark circles around my eyes feel worst.
my greatest issue with this product is that it smells like alcohol

thought this would be best suited for me
not the best eye cream
isn't the best feeling
this has been one of the worst eye creams i have used
thought it was the best eye cream i'd used in a while
not the best eye cream
meadowy smell of the original cream is what i loved most
never had any problem even if i put the cheapest one
the green clay is my favorite of the three.
the one i like best is the green one since it has a cooling effect unlike the rest
my biggest gripe is the bottle.
i will never know because this is the worst packaging ever
average at best.. back to la mer...
if you're a person that needs hydration this is the best product for you
seriously the strongest not pleasant smell i've experienced in a face product in years
the night cleanser was the most underwhelming item in the set
my favorite sephora consultant suggested this too me
the worst part came when i was applying makeup
this is my least favorite day moisturizer that i have tried
this is possibly the worst product i've ever put on my face
perhaps this is best suited for someone younger?
that's the biggest issue/pet peeve of this moisturizer
the best thing to do is use it at night
first things first - the dropper is genius.

it gives me the worst breakouts ever
it's just not my all-time favorite 2nd-step cleanser after oil cleansing
this is by far the worst face soap i ever purchased

my favorite one being the ren rose balm.
