it lasts very long if you only use a pea size amount
i also love the travel size
a small small drop goes a long way.
the product sizes are quite generous for those on a budget
however, the bottle is large and heavy.

i really recommend to get the larger size too since it is better value
thinking about buying the larger size
i ordered the 1 oz size through a gift set
you use a tiny dime size of the wash
a small pea-size amount is all i need to lather up my whole face
i only have to use a pea sized amount of product per application
i take probably a size of a pea
smaller than a pea sized amount foams up nicely
i only need about a pea-sized amount for my face
you need less than a dime-sized amount
all you need is less than a dime size drop.
you literally need a half-a-pea-size with this
using it small pea sized
a mere pea sized amount is sufficient
will purchase full size of it!
the tiniest amount does the job
you literally only need a little over a dime size
you don't even need to use a "dime" size amount
a pea size drop goes a long way
half of pea size is all you need
a pea-size dollop is more than enough
a dime size gives tons of foam
you really only need a pea sized amount to get the full face cleansed
a pea size is sufficient.
you only need about a size of a small pearl
you literally only need an amount a tiny pbit bigger than a pea
so be sure to add about a dime's size of product
you only need a little pea size amount to wash your face so this larger bottle can definitely last a long time
a literal 'pea' size amount will be definitely sufficient for a clean fresh face
a pea size does the job
all you need is a pea size drop
be cautious that this will foam up with only a pea sized amount
bought the full size
less then a dime size amount
creamy that you really shouldnt use more than a pea size amount
