definitely left a slightly blue/purple tint to my very fair skin
most colored products don't actually color the skin
it is blue in color
i expected a more luxurious texture.
my face also feels more moisturized and smoother.
i liked the blue color
skin has a gorgeous luster
yes your skin is more toned
this seems like it was more designed for mature skin with visible wrinkles
my skin did look smooth after peeling offf
first time i tried glam glow.
my skin looked more radiant for sure
every glam glow product i've ever used my skin reacts too
i always love everything from glam glow
it also helped to smooth out my skin a bit.
the peeling is nice
while the chrome/silver aspect of it is cool.
this serum made my skin really smooth
it has a gel-like consistency
it feels similar to a sticky lip gloss
adds a glow or something
makes it feel silky smooth
or make the skin around my eyes super smooth
not impressed with this eye cream.
medium job of making my eyes look better.
the texture of it is soft
the texture is great
i'd wake up with a tinge of brightness
pleasant on the skin
it feels light but also waxy.
really enjoying the sun coverage
seems to make my pores look larger
the texture is greasy
it made my skin feel like a glazed doughnut
leaving a perfectly matte finish
good for combo skin
this stuff makes my eyes so bright
smooth the appearance of my fine lines
i noticed my skin was smoother
i am always the lightest foundations with cool/neutral undertones
it has a horrible sticky texture
it didn't even improve my skin texture.
i do enjoy the tingly effect of the product
turnaround overnight radiant lines
the cream feel nice
has a really nice texture
my skin tone could use some brightening up
didn't change the texture or tone at all
it does have a very satiny smooth finish
an overall more even complexion
the smoothness is worth it
my skin looked flawless
i do recommend the the exfolikate 2 min facial that made my skin so smooth
developed a weird texture on my forehead from it
it makes my face feel smooth.
make my skin look great.
my face looks like my skin peeled
it didn't feel smooth
makes my skin so smooth afterwards
it makes my skin feel nice and smooth.
my pores look amazing
made a awful bronzed orange colour.
using it as a primer it gives me a beautiful glow just as the lmercier radiance primer
once i put it on it looked amazing to have a "natural glow"
i will say that the shimmer in this is very fine
doesn't seem like shimmer at all
gave me a slight tingle
i did not notice a glowing look to my skin
my face definitely feels smoother in the am
make my skin smoother i couldn't st
legs to get a nice shine
my legs looked shiny
it made my skin look dewy for a few minutes
the cooling sensation is nice
it glides on well
i do feel like this brightened up my skin tone especially when i used it in combination with the vinoperfect radiance serum
is much healthier for your skin
my face was instantly shiny
everyone's skin is different
it make my skin shiny
this makes my masks go on smoother
my skin felt smoother after the mask
polished like their previous skin care line did
my skin looks dull.
this product also leaves my skin with a strange texture
slightly tacky to the touch
make it feel smooth
to the touch feels like it'd be weightless
it was just a bit too light in texture
it made my face look shiny
despite having oily skin it was incredible- my skin was luminous
it looks more dull and rough.
i prefer a thick consistency
it also gives me a nice radiant glow
ok so this left skin softer/smoother
as far as brightening goes
i don't see any "brightness"
this oil didn't enhance the oiliness to my face
step 2 didn't smooth any wrinkles
the cream has a nice texture
dry mature skin i need something creamier based.
although silicones give a smooth feel/appearance to the face
it feels super light
made her skin glow
the burgundy red color of the whole line is not very appealing
it feels super lovely
the skin around my eyes looks very supple
the gel-like consistency feels cool against the skin
the texture is really fun
i like the texture
the cream looks white in the photo
saw some even chunkier
surprisingly the glow part didn't add much of a drama to the moisturize
this was a nice illuminator mixed with foundation
it gave we a great dewy glow!
complimented my tan really well
looked great in sunlight as well!
the consistency is nice and light.
just wore this with finishing powder since this color complimented my tan so well
the shimmer stick on top and is a nice bonus.
leaves a dewy like complexion
felt that the "glow" made my skin too shiny
did add luminosity to my skin
the glow it gives is nice, but subtle.
it made the rest of my makeup look extremely cakey
it does leave a nice luminous glow to the skin
i ended up looking over bronzed and fakey.
which is what i love as it gives you a hint of glow
pigmented with a nice satin finish
it makes my skin look bright and alive.
my skin is more medium toned
the actual glow was very subtle!
can be used under foundation for a dewy glowy look
glow gives a very pretty glowy finish that makes it look like you just spent an afternoon at the beach
the builtin highlighter gives you even more glow
a nice highlight for your cheekbones
it added a nice dewy glow to make up
it has a satin finish which feels nice
the shimmer that comes along with it
the shimmer highlight in the cap is also a great touch
the flip cap touch-on-shimmer was a bit dark for my complexion to be used as a highlighter
it gives a very nice champagne shimmer color to the skin
immediately thought the color was beautiful
i looked like an oil slick
i suspect it would also look really nice to mix a little bit with your foundation for a more dewy glow
it made for a pleasant bonus
it gave a good glow
it gives a nice glow with your makeup
this is beautiful, if you have a tan.
nice "glow" about it too
left my skin beautiful
to me the texture left different
it also makes my nose look so shiny
it really enhances your blemishes
it has a great texture
am hoping that will make my skin smoother
everyone's skin is different
while the texture is nice
it has that silky silicone feeling
my skin did not look any brighter or plumper
gives the skin that beautiful healthy look
if anything it was less supple and radiant.
i thrive for my skin to feel cool
the texture itself is quite thin though
though it does have a smooth texture to it
my skin seemed brighter
it makes my skin feels a tinny bit fresher
smoother after the use
the consistency is really runny
the color is really nice
it didn't brighten the skin either
the texture is great too.
it is a gold color
my skin wasn't more radiant
it looks so luxurious
it looks like glittery gold nail polish in the bottle
it was lovely in color
i don't need to sparkle that much
the texture is nice
i love the glow it gives my skin
my skin feels more glowy
it actually feels matte after application
the promises made are glorious
it's like a illuminating skin primer
it is pleasant to use
the eye cream is awesome
the color is a black blue
it makes skin nice
the texture was very thin
i don't feel brightened.
it does make my skin more radiant and brightened.
the texture is amazing.
leaves you with a magical glow
i do think it brightens my complexion
makes you look greasy4.
it brightened my skin only because it has very fine shimmer in it
it felt light weight
brightened my skin well
just little bumps that change the texture of your skin
it was recommended to me for brightening
the texture is lightweight
as another reviewer said appears to have a shimmery quality that isn't noticeable just looking at the cream itself
i still really enjoy the texture of this cream i just wish it was thicker
the texture is really nice
texture is so cool
didnt make my skin feel smooth at all
the texture is very unique
it has very fine subtle shimmer in it
refreshing against the skin
and my unevenness in skin tone was magnified.
i liked the texture
fine lines or radiance
this lightened it a bit
i noticed a difference in her skin texture
i like the texture of the product
should really be denser texture
the texture was nice
it has a cool gel-cream texture that feels nice going on
i also find that it makes my eye make up cakey which adds to the crepiness of my eyelids
feels tingly and soothing but that's about it.
i like the tingle effect.
i noticed instant warmth on my face like an irritation
i love my glam glow and origins .. took it back!
this has a pink pearly effect to it which looks nice on pale skin
not too shimmering as some said
this "glotion" is very nice as brightening your appearance
surprising too sparkly in the sunlight
hate the matte feeling.
i love the glow/shimmer it gives
looks flawless under foundation
it is shimmery, sparkly and just not for me.
it made me look sweaty rather than "glowy".
i love the way this mask made my skin look
nor did this brighten my skin
on the richer texture
0% smoothness, 0% brightness.. 100% oily look.
it did improve my skin's texture
gives a very slight plumping effect
primes the skin perfectly for makeup
her skin is flawless
was hoping it would make my skin look firmer
looks drier than normal -almost like i have used a powder foundation when my foundation is actually very creamy
didn't make my skin smooth
created horrible texture under my tried
it left a shiny gleam on my skin so that i looked very oily
it leaves your face a slight shine
texture were so rich
with a smoother gel-like consistency
just to make their skin matte
made my foundation look less smooth
i layered it on top of the foundation.
you still see the shine
the matte didn't last long
my skin almost seemed to look
a brightening cream that actually darkens
whipped texture feels very soft
this cream does have a whipped consistency
i like the texture.
it has a whipped texture
the glow is nice, very subtle.
want a dewy natural look sans any foundation
i like a good glow
i love the glow it gives my skin underneath my foundation
perfect for summer glowy perfection!
nothing special, no glow.
i know better than to buy something with glow or luminous in name
it gave my skin a beautiful glow
it was a beautiful shimmer under my everyday foundation
sparkles more than illuminates
saw how beautiful the nude color blended in with my skin
this product in the deepest color gives me face a nice healthy tint without wearing makeup
it also has a watery consistency
the glow is a little lack luster.
i don't see any glow or illumination
the product has a light tint to it
your skin looks radiant with it.
this cream made my skin look nice
it does give a beautiful luminosity to the skin
***i feel that illuminating drops added to tinted moisturizer will achieve the same sought-after glow that this product gives for much less than $50
i loved the subtle illuminating effect
this is a no go glam glow.
it's just unfortunate that naturally oily girls tend to look shinier with the illuminating effects of the product
this is beautiful for formal looks
you get a really nice glow
your skin looks flawless
the shade is flattering
it didnt really make my skin glow too much
it also made my nars sheer glow foundation ball up
i didn't notice any blurring or mattifying qualities to it
while it provided a nice silicone-like feeling
it instantly makes my skin look matte
making my skin feel smooth
this has a thick, matte primer-like finish.
despite the initial matte finish
although the product feels great on my skin- weightless
there was nothing matte about it.
it goes on super grainy.
t's definitely got the thick consistency
at first the product seemed to really blur imperfections
i like the texture
dewy look i achieved after using my play
it smoothes out uneven texture
i didn't see my pores smooth out or imperfections blur
i love the dewy look
this eye cream sounds amazing
unfortunately didn't improve my skin texture or tone
my skin seemed duller than ever
the consistency is very thick
the texture is pleasant
it goes on smooth
it is a nice thick cream
texture is very thick
it's weightless on my skin
i wanted a dewy complexion so a staff member recommended this product
glittery/shiny is not the same thing as dewy!
made your skin luminous
the shimmer is perfect for a summer glow.
translate into something less misleading: radiance = glitter
it gives a nice glow when you apply it
the gold in the gel gave me a glow
it leaves your skin looking luminous
with a little bit of shimmer in it
this sounded perfect for my skin needs
lightweight feelthe bad: too much glitter
i didn't care for the gold sheen because it made my forehead look shinier
the consistency was thick
the gold sparkles were nice
my skin did not look matte as it was promised
the gold sparkles in it were stunning
it gives you a subtle glow
although i get the concept of the luminous look
i still looked shiny
clarisonic my skin was noticeably dull
that the color is pretty cool
glam glow mask does come with a brush
my skin feels smooth
i honestly thinks the smoothness is from all the peach fuzz
the color is also really cool.
only good thing about this is the metallic look.
sure the metallic copper is a cool look
just splurge on the glam glow one
its fun to see the copper color on your face
in fact it reminded me how nice a copper sheen makes my eyes look greener
it dries to a beautiful bronze color
it did feel weightless
was so light that it smoothed on nicely
loved the texture and absorbs very fast.
my skin feels like silk day
i liked the texture of it which was sticky
face does feel immediately supple
it has not improved my skin texture
it feels absolutely divine on the skin
makes your skin feel plump
it gives you a healthy skin glow.
my uneven texture started to disapate
the consistency is thin
it did make my skin look glowy
make me shinier than usual
this moisturizer seemed to work well providing a nice glow under my foundation
a little more dewy than i'd like
not an enjoyable sensation.
on the bright side it does give you a nice glow
maybe i just like the green color
my face look so shiny/oily
my skin felt velvety smooth right after
it sits on the skin so nicely
helps keep me matte throughout the day
the texture of this stuff
it does have a matte finish
this did nothing to matte my skin.
my skin looked shiny
plump on the skin
this mousiurizer gave off a slightly pink illimunated glow that was very pretty
the texture is so pasty
was hoping for a dewy or natural soft glow
on top of the producting feeling like it didnt absorb the appearance is less dewy
made me feel glittery
the simmer makes my face look pink with hint of glitter
the glow it gives is nice
was initially impressed with the pink glow it gives skin
it looks like a quartzy holographic highlighter with some shimmer
my smooth skin now has a bumpy texture all over
not ruin my skin texture
makes skin super smooth
especially when i'm at my palest
i noticed smoother skin
it can also feel slightly striping on my skin.
doesn't seem to make a difference in skin texture at all
my skin did not feel softer or look brighter.
i did not enjoy the consistency or texture of this product
i didn't feel or notice any more vibrant/radiant like i do with other masques
the texture is difficult to apply
it gave me more of a glowy/dewy look instead of a brightening
this one leaves my skin actually glowing
did not see an instant glow.
the texture is chunky
would much prefer a smoother texture.
it gives you a nice natural glow
i liked the texture
it did give a slight pearly finish after application
i expected a slight glow
in my opinion gives your face a much softer more natural glow
dewy glow to my face--
the glow is more golden than pink.
i like the texture
the level of glow is dim
really did nothing to illuminate the skin
my skin just looked shiny
is farrrr too shimmery for individuals with medium to dark skin tones
it's more like a highlighter with excessive highlight powder takes forever to blend
it does "brighten" my eyes
it does brighten under my eyes
it left uneven pearlescent streaks
slightly iridescent eye cream that doesn't do as much as tata's other eye creams
it leaves a whites film on the eyes i like how it's shimmer
was excited for this eye cream
all this did was accentuate them due to its shimmer
it left my skin smooth
looking brighter over all
the consistency is super super sticky
the tube looks like a healthy size
i love how bright it makes my skin first off.
the color is an opalescent white which is pretty
ok so the made my face glow.
like the instant brightening effect
the texture of my skin can be compared to an orange peel
which performed beautifully on my skin
the heaviness of this cream made it worse
it made my skin look firmer
smooth after i use it
i can feel my skin was brightened after using it
this feels luxurious on my skin.
the warmth of it on my skin is very relaxing
the warming sensation it gives
has a nice warming sensation
thickness of the mask just makes it feel like its truly working
the consistency is very thick
it was bright, silky smooth and plump.
the warming sensation was nice
or my texture better
the tingling sensation was nice.
my skin is glowing
i also liked the warming sensation on my skin.
it goes on very smooth and thick.
i like the color
the gooey texture on my face was not very pleasant
it does brighten the skin
gives only a nice glow.
i love a good glowy dewey look to my skin.
all about the supple appearance.
no highlighter appearance, no glow, no shimmer.
it made my skin look very sparkly
the moisture element of this mask was superb
my skin does look plumg
the texture of this product is great
the texture is marvelous though!
my skin felt smooth
the texture for this product felt more like a gel
it still looks very cakey
"one tone fits for all skin tones" is quite an over statement
smooth on my skin
i just wish it came in a lighter shade!
i found it makes my skin look
it made my skin look very pale
then i'm also left with color that doesn't blend well with my skin tone
i do like the texture
the light weight feel
it covers redness beautifully.
for more medium toned faces with redness-- i'd say definitely take a chance on this cream
i am a very pale natural redhead.
it still sometimes looks a bit "cakey"
my complexion is fair/light
milky texture it doesn't set matte
actually makes my makeup look less appealing
the texture was nice
your make up will look beautiful
while it gives my skin a nice finish
had almost a dry scaly texture
the first thing i noticed was the white color that made my skin look really pale
the finish was too matte for my skin
leaving my complexion looking dull
it doesn't have a matte finish
it does create a smooth surface
brighten my under eyes
i like the texture
it did not brighten
i like its texture
the consistency is very thick
it looks more like thin layer of good color over the redness
the slight tint it gives
since this is tinted
in fact the texture of it made my skin redder
it seemed to just take away all the liveliness in my skin
the product also leaves my face lighter than my skin tone
im pale so this won't work for darker skin tones
out on my very fair complexion
made me look greasy
my skin looked so even in regards to color
when i saw myself in the mirror with natural lighting
the color was fine
might work better for those who have darker skin tones than me
it's basically greenish white foundation
it is a very thick consistency.
i liked the color correction
i wish is was more matte
it's a creamy green color that goes on effortlessly
the consistency is very thick
it made my skin look dewey
i like the texture
the consistency stays really balmy
i gave it one star for the texture
overall my skin looks smoother
leaves the skin smooth
the texture is great
it actually looks greasier
left my skin plump
it also did not really help blur my pores/slight imperfections
didn't brighten my under eyes
the texture was slightly sticky
it made my skin look healthy and supple.
this was nothing like my normal "oiliness
hard to smooth into the skin
it makes my skin feel like velvet
i did see some results in smoothness
the texture reminds me of the benefit porefressional
overall it made my skin feel smooth
the texture is too thick / hard to blend
makes my eye area look greasy
makes you sparkle, not glow..
it does make my makeup sparkle
makes it glow brighter
s looking like a sparkly mess
once i entered natural light the product was all sparkles
"natural looking glow" in the description made me laugh
it definitely brightened my skin.
it is so sparkly
it does give your skin a subtle illuminated look
in direct sunlight it looks ridiculous
and it is very noticeable and glittery!
it helps highlight my cheekbones even more!!
it is not illuminating
just coats your face in sparkle
it left me looking oily and shiny.
the highlight is a shimmery sheen
about 10% of the glow would've been nice
it seemed to highlight my pores on my cheeks
the weird sheen it gives is very off putting
it does make my skin does look brighter
the pink tint didn't work for me
t just made my foundation look glittery
this is definitely glittery
doesn't give you that refreshed glow!
want some glow to my skin
it left my skin way too shiny for my taste
reflects in this pink
t was obviously sparkles
looks gorgeous in sunlight
the sparkle that seemed to be on my h
had high hopes for a nice illuminating moisturizer
you can see the sparkles
mind your skin tone
too much shine and sparkle for me.
i do like using it top of cheekbones for a glow
looks good as a highlighter worn alone.
i also blend a cream highlighter on top of brighter days for even more intensity
under eyes look so moisturized and dewy looking.
and does not accentuate my lines which is great.
like the look for what i'm using it for inspire of the sparkles
it is way too shimmery
the sparkles look white on your face
it has straight up chunky glitter in it
not in a "sparkly" way
maybe in a shimmery way
it is definitely not a soft illumination
until i looked at my face in bright lighting
it accentuated all of my skin texture
it did give me a nice highlight on my cheekbones
the accentuated skin texture was terrible
it also has a fine micro glitter that looks very obvious in bright lighting
the sparkles stay on your h
for reference my skin color is is light with neutral undertones
shiny also really soft
has shimmer in it which i don't like at all
to me it just looked like awkward shiny under eye skin
i like the smooth texture of this product.
it has the texture of a primer
it is definitely smoothing!
just want to smooth out the texture
shimmery finish which was great for highlighting during the day
i like the shimmer color it has to it
it has a nice texture
i don't think it really brightens or helps with dark circles
i did feel that my foundation applied a bit smoother
the consistency is nice and light and non greasy.
it does provide a smooth feel.
it gave an instant blur affect to my under eyes making my concealer set
there was definitely less smudging
eyeshadow colors showed more vibrantly
the texture is nice as lancôme has great quality.
my face actually looks duller
my skin feels nice and silky but that's about it.
the texture is like a gel consistency
the consistency is very light
i loved the immediate change to my skin texture
helped smooth fine lines
my foundation looked crackly
my skin looked dewy
it has some shimmer to it
it made the foundation textured
not sure how i feel about the shimmer/tint
the texture of this product are fantastic
the light hint of humor highlight in the product
doesn't change the texture of my skin
it made my face look shiny
it makes my texture look even worse
it sat on the surface of my skin emphasizing all of the texture on my face
it has fine shimmer which unfortunately clings to texture
i liked the texture and how it looked on.
the sample made me glow
wear this the shimmer aspect is not to bad
makes my skin dewy
doesn't really control the shininess that i am used to in a primer
makes my skin feel smooth
my skin was smooth
it's that typical pinky iridescent tone
my foundation alone wears beautifully
this left smooth skin
make me look like i had spray tanned my face
it added a little more of a glow to my skin
the texture is nice
goes on smooth without feeling sticky or too matte
sure it looks a little brighter
everyone's skin is different
i liked its texture
my skin has looked incredibly refreshed
the texture looks a little bit weird: it is not very smooth
didnt glide on smooth i am going back to korres
no difference in skin texture
while at first i loved the texture
all it does is provide the smooth glide over ease over the face
it is a very dark color
i wish this comes in more tones
the color is off for my tone
the tint in this product left a noticeable makeup line
would be ideal for an oily person with medium-toned skin
it does manage to blur skin a bit
gives a sort of ruddy looking cast to the skin
the tint of this stick is darker than what it appears online
it made my fair skin look orange-y
maybe it should have a few more shades available in order to match more skin colors because it does blur pores nicely
it looks light with pink undertones in the picture
would have given this 4 stars if the shade had been universal to all skin tones
for very fair skin tones
it made me look ashy
if this came in a paler shade
the shade was too dark for my light skin color
it absorbs oil and provides a matte appearance.
not like greasy shiny
didn't make my face look less shiny
shiny even through my matte foundation powder
it feels refreshing and doesn't irritate my eyes.
just because it does make my skin feel smoother
3rd uses face felt softer
my face looks/ feels more textured
glowiness or improved skin texture
the perfect swirls made me happy
it didn't improve my texture or combo skin either
i also like the texture.
your skin looks glowy
can keep my skin smooth
my skin looks as shiny as an oil slick
it definitely gave my skin such a pretty glow
it completely made her skin look flawless
everyone's skin is different
it also doesn't help that it comes with a faint orange tint
product has an extremely liquidy consistency
weather was dry and it made my skin glow.
and it makes my pores seem more pronounced.
my skin seemed drier
makes your skin feel supple and comfortable.
the texture is oily and feels cheap.
i don't see a difference in texture or quality of my skin
made my makeup look ashy
has uneven skin tone
keeps my skin clear
it is great for smoothing the skin
make my foundation patchy
you can really see its blurring effect : it suddenly makes your skin matte
does help blur imperfections
it is a rather unique product that smoothes out the skin
it's also got a lovely smoothing effect that makes my skin feel soft
not a great quality in an eye cream
my skin ends up looking pale
i definitely like the texture
the cream is smooth
does give an instant matte finish
this left a tingly feeling and a matte finish.
it helps me stay matte
family said that my face looked dewy
i love the texture, it is so light and smooth.
the only shade that really matched my skin was the darkest shade
not only was the lightest shade wayyy to dark
gives a nice light even-ness on your skin
i love how it makes my skin look glowy
darker colors so that everybody can enjoy
the thicker soft cream actually works better for me
i think this helps with the texture
gives the skin a very subtle glow
i think i'll go back to vinoperfect radiance instead
this does nothing for smoothing of the eyes!
my make up was super "dewy" that day
went on well and made my skin look bright.
i looked like an oil slick
when i added to my foundation i did not look dewy
it does make your skin so smooth
it makes the foundation smoother in my opinion
makes my foundation look blotchy
makes his skin look great
blemish prone skin that can look a little dull
my skin looked more radiant
creates a textured finish with makeup
notice my skin looks a little brighter which is nice
it is also gorgeous to look at
it left my 60 year old mom's skin super smooth.
cool color of the product
makes my skin look radiant
helps provide a natural glow under your constructed complexion
the product looks beautiful
there is a shimmer to it
my skin seems to be smoother
the texture of it was nice
buuuut if you don't really like sparkle/shimmer
prefer a more natural/toned down look
the color is captivating.
this for the sake of sparkle
is a cool glowy pink color
my skin looked great
its sparkly pink format
f you're sensitive it has fine glitter/sparkles in the formula
it comes out a pink color
it is a nice primer due to the tacky texture it leaves
while this product does give some glow
this product didn't give me a dewy glow
i just lost my vibrancy
my skin looks shiny even hours after i use it
it also leaves you looking very shiny.
it's like a thicker gel consistency
i like them to have a silky feel
for a mask that claims to brighten
maybe it's for more oily complexions.
it didn't make my skin look glowy or radiant.
the rubbery texture was something very interesting
this mask looked very unique
the appearance was cool
however it has a very thick texture
didn't fit the contour of my face well
refreshing on the skin
at the start the warming tingling sensation was amazing
i also liked the texture.
it sounded nice "the water cream"
made my cheeks bright red/ sensitive
feels weightless on skin
my complexion is even
i really love its texture
left my face shinier than i wanted it to be
the texture is very interesting
it does make your skin feel super smooth
the texture is very lightweight almost water like
the consistency is so thin
the my skin smoother
the texture is silky and easy to apply.
it felt very silky
i take excellent care of my skin
had such a nice glow
it was like glitter
the texture of the solid is off for me
my skin looked radiant after i used it
pros: made me feel like sonic
my face was so smooth
it feels beautiful while applying
well the ball is swishy
it makes my skin drier
the ball is super bouncy and just looks cool.
everyone's skin is different
no glow at all.
i normally like what the glow recipe team delivers
plump the skin under my eyes
i don't feel like this makes my skin brighter or smoother
it is a light gel consistency.
this product is just a lip gloss.
it looked really beautiful in the jar
it has a glossy texture
my skin just glows
the texture is great
kind of giving you a more matte complexion
no glow at all
the rest of my skin however was glowy
my skin did not look more youthful.
leave you with glowing skin after use
it didn't make my skin any brighter or smoother
not brighter, not smoother, not softer.. nothing.
lasting glow with continued use
my skin looks no brighter than when it does when using my usual mask regimen
i experienced more intense brightening from the glamglow brightening mask
however, this is a more gentle texture.
my skin looked pretty luminous
gives my face a smooth finish
i loved the way this skin tint felt on my skin: silky
i would definitely recommend this skin tint
the color light is too pink
that color matched ok
it leaves my skin smooth
i don't feel like my skin was any smoother or firm
overall the product smoothed my skin
this made my skin glow
created extra shininess to my skin by the end of the day
as the product claims to help with textured skin
gave my skin radiance upon application
not an improved amount of radiance overall
it made my skin smoother
i noticed my skin was more supple
it doesn't control shine
doesn't control shine well
it will make your skin glow.
my skin no longer looked matte
the product is very smooth
texture of the gel feels nice though
product gave a little tingle
would wake up to an oily complexion
the only upside to this product is my skin does look more radiant
i do love the way it makes my skin seem brighter
i really liked the thick texture
my skin would literally be glowing
the texture was fine
leaves me silky smooth
i would say instead of a "glossy" texture according to the description
i gave this two stars only for its brightening qualities
it is so thin in consistency
had an almost watery weightless feel to it
gave it a glowing look
or smooth out the texture
it stays pretty matte
wish it was thicker
didn't boost my skin's radiance at all.
it maybe made my skin a little brighter
my makeup looked patchy
after one use my skin was noticeably glowing
makes my skin look great
never made my skin matte
it definitely has a matte finish however
the consistency is quite thick.
it has a lot of good ingredients to improve your complexion
the texture is nice, too.
they make my skin glow and feel so dewy.
it is extremely waxy in texture
my face became smoother
& foundation ended up looking chalky.
it gives me a youthful glow.
my skin started to tingle
it looks like a thick product
milky consistency that doesn't absord well into the skin
i remember it being a richer silkier cream.
the texture is way too thick
this gives me a whipped and fake texture.
leaves your skin plump
the formula now is completely different it is lighter in texture
my skin looked better again
made my skin smoother
weirdly enough seemed to make my skintone more uneven
the texture of my skin
this is a very lightweight eye cream

the texture is lightweight
lacks on the brightening part
as far as brightening goes
i would rather be dewy than matte.

not in a youthful taut way

my skin was so textured
the result was a nice matte supple face
made it look glowy still somehow
made my face very oily/shiny
the glow was nice though!
i would say this is definitely more matte than glow
its supposed to be "matte"
so very disappointed glam glow
definitely leaves my skin looking matte
goes on the skin nicely
by keeping my skin matte
for foundation i use a full matte finish product
it makes my foundation go on super smooth
it definitely provides a matte
not at all matte
also provide a more matte finish
the only thing i can give positive feedback on is the matte lip plumper by them
gave me a slight glow
i notice how even my skin tone looks
it does beautifully brighten the complexion
no difference in dark spots or radiance
this explains the softness/calmness
the consistency is odd, kinda runny and thin.
it definitely made my skin a little brighter
my skin was brighter
it's supposed to promotes even skin tone
or for radiance overall
other than feeling refreshing due to its gel texture it has minimal benefit for skin around the eyes
gives the sensation of opening yours eyes
while it soothes my undereye it has not improved my dark circles
my skin feels refreshing
you smooth/ swipe this over your skin
the tube says it "brightens
my skin does not look more radiant or smooth.
hoped this balm will help my skin tone

i usually use a radiance primer
because the glow/radiance comes mainly in the form of shine

it's a thick cream that make me look shiny
leaves a little bit of a glossy look on your face
get shinier throughout the day

now it is smooth & soft & holds moisture better.
texture were pleasant enough
give my face a smoother feel/look
the texture is nice
this eye cream goes on very smooth
a sephora associate raved about this eye balm
get many compliments on the clarity of skin
my eye brightener does not go on as smoothly as it does with a creamier product
this is a nice cream for your eyes.
my complexion is normal
the texture is weird
this is a good calming mask.
it is very calming
i did not notice a brighter skin tone afterward
i love how smooth the cream is
is the perfect consistency for a night cream
i feel the tops of my eyes are smoother also.
i love the smooth texture.
texture matched the facial cream
i like the way this eye cream blends into my skin
the texture is really fluid
hard to work with it's texture is literally like yogurt maybe slightly thinner
i fail to see a longed-for plumpness
the product feels pasty
the texture is a little odd
so maybe it is better as a lip contour cream
this is a thick cream that goes on very smooth.
i wanted a an eye cream that would blend easy
this is a thick and tan.
i like that its a matte finish
everyone's skin is different
he didn't like the texture
i mean it glides on good
on the plus side: nice texture

so much for brightening and firming!!
didn't like the texture at all
after 2 splashes i can still feel the creaminess on my skin… after 4th then that's when my skin feels "squeaky" clean

definitely felt my skin looking brighter
its improved the texture and tome of my skin.
leaves a very smooth film on my face
the texture is light-to-medium-weight
it does not brighten the undereye
it doesn't firm or smooth the fine wrinkels
use a more effective eye cream that does brighten
it doesn't brighten or firm my eyes really
leaves the eye area smooth and soft.
it does brighten a little
i loved its texture
made my skin look
it did nothing to smooth fine lines
the texture of this primer is so smooth
it is a tinted primer
if your skin is darker than the primer
works for lighter-skinned people
not darker-skinned people
it does leave my skin matte
after maybe 10 mins it was highlighting my flakiness skin
initially my makeup looked flawless
it makes the skin super smooth
keeps me matte half of the day.
velvety then actually helping my pores look any better for my dry-
it looks like it sits on top of my skin
t makes my skin look yellow
however maybe on lighter complexions it's more noticeable?
the color of the formula turned my very fair skin orange
version is of a thinner consistency
gives your face an instant glow

i can tell my complexion is healthier
the texture is thick
it also left like a cakey film on my face.

it doesn't plump or brighten
it makes my skin color fade
normally i have a bright hue to my skintone
my skin color looked faded
leaves my skin silky smooth once i'm finished
it is more on the thinner/runnier side
the white lucent set
shiseido's satin finish foundation without having any problem

as this cream doesnt feel like it delivers
leave skin so smooth
i liked the thick texture
the texture was too thick
the consistency was also a bit watery feeling
i also like the texture
it definitely smoothes wrinkles
everyone's skin is different
the texture of the wipe is rough
i do get a lil dewy on my forehead
it doesn't keep my skin matte
as a moisturized i like the lightness of this product
i looked like a shiney
wish it kept my skin matte longer
the texture however is very nice
it helps other brightening products to keep them faded
the texture is not great.
my skin never really got the brightness i was hoping for

though my skin has become more radiant

i would like to see clinique create a undeye cream that brightened

it's texture is way too thick
was the very nice creamy feel of it

it was completely smooth
although my skin felt smoother
feels a little rough and scratchy.

the silicone texture of the product seems to sit on top of my skin

my skin was radiant
the texture is smooth

my skin looked fresher the next day
undereye circles looked darker
actually made my eyes look gritty
made my overall complexion look worse
my skin tone is still uneven
it has a great texture
that has made my skin perfect
made it turn a dull color
i like the matte finish
my thoughts for this is that it is very smooth to glide on to my face
evened out my skin tone more than the murad gel
the product changes color from a clear gel to a orange
mostly lightening on the coloration
looks more even in tone
this product does give you a slight glow
caudalie's night correcting cream did not lighten my dark spots like caudalie's "vinoperfect radiance serum" has
feels lovely on the skin
i liked the texture
the color is darker

way softer than normal
kinda gave me that halo glow celebrities try to achieve with lighting
it made my skin have an oil slick like shine
this made my cheeks
smooth out my skin overall
made my skin look worn
it had a nice texture going on
the only thing i liked about this cream was that it did give my skin a more youthful glow
very soft and nicely absorbs.
the consistency is more greasy
i didn't like the texture.
skin does feel smoother
wasn't really brightening at all.
if anything the color was a little darker :(.
it actually accentuates the wrinkles
also doesn't matter how little you use there is always that funky white film that makes for a very uneven texture for concealer

this product goes on with a thickish consistency
i got the brightening one, and it is very drying.
it does leave a nice matte finish

my skin doesn't feel radiant
however the radiance perfection makes my skin oily looking
doesn't do much to brighten my skin
this cream has a nice texture and absorbs well.
i liked the texture
helped my undereye concealor go on much smoother
feels smooth calming at first
both have a nice texture
i felt a cool sensation which was nice
i also need something extra in my eye cream: brightens my dark circles or helps with puffiness
am torn -it does make it smoother
silky like my old one was
doesn't have an appealing texture
it has a nice rich texture
this eye cream has a great texture
though the cream has a great texture

origins ginzing refreshing eye cream is nice is some ways
it goes on smooth
i love the radiance that comes with it
leaves me looking cakey
i honestly think it looks like it lightens your eyes because its a pearly pink color
it left my eyes feeling soft and subtly radiant.
ingredients seem to instantly brighten under my eyes
the color is almost like a foundation bur very sheer
it helps cover the eyebag colors a bit which is wonderful
a nice brightening eye cream.
does brighten your under eye a little
i didn't like the refreshing eye cream because of the pasty feeling
wasn't worth having uneven textured skin
it does go on matte
the gel went on beautifully
at first it was nice leaving a nice glow
the texture is completely different
this cream is a nice texture
it did impart a glow to my skin
the texture gave me silicon feel
which leaves false smooth tactile impression on my face
it felt refreshing and light.
this did nothing to improve the texture of my skin
the consistency is very thick
the cream consistency is nice
feels super luxurious when first applied
the consistency of the cream is lovely.
my face is quite shiny
just perfect balanced clean skin
the mask glides on nicely
it helps with oiliness
second it left my complexion very ruddy looking
the next day i feel like my skin was more reddish

besides providing a slightly smoother surface for concealer
i like its texture.
to the point where your face shines
definitely helps reduce shine
this made my skin look
this product goes on smooth
however my skin begins to look
it didn't make my skin matte
their charcoal mask is phenomenal
nice on the skin
gel consistency was nice
complexion got clearer and pores became smaller.
at first i was captivated by the smoothness of my skin with application
that it clouded my complexion with the activated charcoal
applying foundation seems to go on smooth
it was all black like the color of this gel
primer together leave my fingers a weird color
i think my complexion looked a little less night
there is very obvious shimmer in the black gel
plus this moisturizer has the grayish tint to it that i never used to
the texture is nice and light.
it feels so smooth when first applied.
it made my skin velvety for a short while
it feels that my skin so smooth which is not the normal smooth
which can make skin feels smoother
my skin was glowing and felt like velvet.
or making it softer or brighter
make it feel like silk
while the texture is nice
makes you look super oily
the cream version is very thick
the skin doesn't feel smooth
works amazing after a glam glow mask
warming sensation is nice
it does nothing for my complexion.
i feel like my skin looks duller since i started using these products
my sister's skin looked gorgeous
leaves a somewhat shiny look to my face/youthful glow more than what i already naturally have
the product feels light
other than providing a bit of a plumper look
my skin looked so radiant and youthful.
product does not smooth the crepey look around my eyes
this cream feels light
in terms of skintone evenness
the texture of my skin look worse not better
if it maintained my oiliness better
that never happens with my glam glow.

everyone's skin is different
my skin did indeed feel smoother
this cream has a nice light texture
it was relaxing to wear
the weight of the mask was soothing
the sephora collection instant depuffing eye mask was certainly refreshing
it was just a weird thick smooth/clingy eye cover

paired with my origins eye cream
the texture is bumpy
the complexion pads are way better
leaving a smooth greaseless finish

the shiseido white lucent eye cream works much better
eye cream is toned down
make me look like a shiny teenager
leaves the skin very shiny
dry texture showed through
would keep me matte
i tried using matte foundation to counteract the shine
i looked so greasy in pictures even with my matte make up
it's super thin -- i'm not impressed by the texture
blemishes have lightened maybe slightly.
the richer/thicker version of this product
the thin texture is fine
it definitely lathers nicely with my clarisonic
nice gel like texture
it gives you a healthy glow

great for soothing skin.
not very consistent in texture
makes your skin super smooth
my face looks like it's flaking
color #1 for fair skin
by now it has only given me a beautiful glow

no change in radiance
that colors my impression of its worth

i like the texture.
this mask helped to calm my skin
the next morning my skin looked much brighter with a more even skin tone

the texture is not as great
my skin is smooth
although i like the texture
the moisturizer's texture is great
provides nice moisture with very little shine
i gave it 2 stars because it does brighten my skin

however, i think it has tiny little sparkles?
the skin under my eyes now feels thinner
it doesn't look "cakey" or "flaky"
this eye cream has a nice consistency

helped in brightening skin tone
my complexion is not brighter
it turned a dark orange color
my skin isn't smoother after using this at all.
it gives me a bit of an orange cast
my skin looks much smoother.
i also noticed a glow in skin tone.
the texture is a little odd
all i want is an eye brightening
it had a good texture

i look my skin in the mirror
i still had a layer of shininess
this is just a light milky oil that gives the surface of the skin that light oily glow look

"radiant" skin after using this product
i still have an uneven skin tone
make my skin feel silky smooth
it just has an oily texture
it looked amazing at smoothing the skin
really blurs the appearance of the lines

very smooth on skin
your skin looking smoother

the texture is just ok
because it does give my skin a nice glow

smoothing of my skin made the overall the experience fine
my skin looked brighter
because i struggle with texture

doesn't look chalkycon's: it has not brightened my skin or dark marks at all
it also makes my makeup feel cakey.
i didn't find that it improved my skin's radiance or gave it a brightening/luminous look at all
it has a great texture
it has pinkish color in it
the tint isn't enough tint
it was never smooth.
after 2 months my skin is brighter.
doesn't have enough pigmentation to replace my peachy under-eye corrector
really like how it brightens my eyes
i liked the brightening of the eyes
the medium tone is too pink for my olive asian skin tone
the color was way too pale
the color is very pink.
needs a gentle touch with blending.
the fair color is almost too dark
i didn't like the sheen it leaves on my skin
the produce gave my eyes this strange shiny opalescent look that wasn't attractive
the color matches great with my skin-tone
the mask started getting a really weird texture
does seem to very mildly brighten
it definitely looked cleaner
looks like 90s hair gel
really does make your skin feel smooth
this is a thick gel like consistency
improved tone and texture, easy to use
it does absord well with slightly cooling sensation
my skin looked a bit brighter
the pink color still on my face
everyone's skin is different
the actual texture is very thick
it also did help brighten my skin a bit
i would love a bigger selection in colors!
toes that one of the new shades will work for me because the glow this imparts is to die for
orange for my skin tone
refreshing on your skin
more even skin tone
gave a nice dewy glow--i could never tell i was wearing it
the color is too orange for my skin tone
its more for medium color skin tone.
it was way to dark for my skin tone
looked strange on my skin.
they need to make a shade lighter so more fair to light skin tones can use this as well
this foundation is very watery
this product made me look pink
color is too obvious.
looks super dull after application.
am thinking i should just return it because the color is way too dark/yellow for my alabaster pale skin
nice foundation looks natural
not all of us have a light-medium complexion
also, the color is orange on my fair skin .
dark shades because i was so happy with the formula
i love the way the serum makes my skin look
it does make my skin "dewy"
made my skin look dewy
the color is perfect
i feel like it looks like a powder
the new version leaves a chalky
while the shade is fine for my skin tone
expected it to be tingly
with this my skin is glowing in the morning
i found this product to have a great light texture
noticed that the cream makes my skin feel thinner
other then that cream texture is nice
it made my skin smooth
application is easy as it glides on under eyes
a nice gel-like consistency3.
the texture feels good.
it feels amazing gliding on the skin
it sits on it looking very shiny
the skin underneath was indeed lighter
they made my nose smooth
my nose was super shiny
my eyes were brighter and smoother looking.
left a very frosty white shimmer behind
the day really brightens up my eyes
the pm is fantastic: made my eyes appear smoother
the am did brighten
the mask has a nice texture that applies evenly
hoping the other glam glow muds perform better than this one
there is a somewhat tingly sensation
it sort of tingles on the skin a bit
this glam glow purchase does not work for me.
this is my favourite of the glam glow masks!
it also didn't brighten my skin as i wanted
while i think i saw s subtle glow return to my skin
seemed to smooth fine lines
i feel like it accentuated my fine lines
has an awesome texture
the product seems having good texture
on the product a crease is created giving the illusion that a new wrinkle appeared
in the past during facial pumpkin peels have really brightened my skin
made the skin tone uneven which is a con
i really don't see a difference in the texture of my skin
her skin looks much younger
it feel very luxurious
although it leaves the texture of my skin supple
i think it's been healing with brightness
does it help even and brighten your skin?
while it made the texture of my skin better
it does calm the skin
it does make your skin smoother
it made my skin smooth
it goes on smooth
the texture is rough not smooth at all.
it would make my vision blurry
the consistency is a nice smoothy thick cream which absorbs quickly
it made my skin so smooth
leaves my skin smooth
i liked the texture
while it does brighten the complexion
makes skin look smoother without irritating skin
it really smoothed my skin out
brightening or firming like it promised
it made my skin bright
it gave my skin an awesome glow
the texture of the product is nice
really liked the texture
i like the texture of ultimune a lot
my skin is still dull with uneven texture.
still have uneven skin tone
could improve my skin tone
making my skin more youthful
this product would "calm" my reddy skin tone
since it is cream like in texture
it has a very nice texture
as others have noted the texture is thick
this eye cream comes in a weird texture that's between a cream
well i love the texture the second it hits my skin
it blurs your vision
excellent for aging skin
the oily film it leaves is a lot lighter
nice thickness and smells great.
it has a tad of a sticky texture
without it looking cakey
was hoping on more vibrant skin.
this serum however only slightly smoothed skin.
my skin looks blotchy
my skin does feel smooth after use
i would like my skin to look more glowy
my skin does feel smoother
it brightens my skin
this didnt help my uneven skintone even after using 1/2 the bottle
in the morning saw a brighter looking complexion
bought this cream to even my skin tone
besides the watery consistency
this product did make my skin feel smoother
my face feels silky smooth after it absorbs
skin feels smooth when first apply on.
light texture that feels amazing on the skin
it made my skin smooth.
i -think- it helped skin tone
think a richer/more concentrated texture would feel much more satisfying
makes my skin look
the texture is nice
this product did absolutely nothing in terms of contouring/slimming my jawline
this product "lifts" facial features such as cheeks
makes my skin very smooth
my skin stays shiny after i put it on
it did brighten my skin
the texture still remains
my skin felt a little more firm and perky.
slightly more youthful looking
5 stars for the immediate smoothing
1 star for the permanent smoothing
it plumps the skin and it's good for baggy eyes.
which makes it look uneven
the texture of my skin changed
especially my cheeks to a rougher feel
it feels refreshing on the skin
the glam glow power cleanse is a better product.
skin was fine looked good
i love the glam glow mask
has a beautiful slip to it
my skin looked great
this made my face very oily n shiny
while my skin does feel smoother
it was so unflattering and weirdly texturized.
my skin looked dull
this eye cream feels great
it definitely didn't brighten
makes me look greasy.
texture of my skin was significantly improved
gives it a subtle glow which i like
my rough texture may have improved slightly
like the serum because it makes my skin bright
this is a gentle facial bar
this is ideal for combo/oily skin.
its nice and soothing, lathers really well.
once i started adding a drop or two with my mattifying primer my skin looks gorgeous
texture on my skin
does make it a little brighter
i love how it feels so refreshing with a cooling sensation
it was semi-brightening
it does not leave the skin silky smooth
i also feel that it adds some brightness
only makes the undereye area a bit smoother
it feels like it makes a difference on my puffiness
it turns matte, with an almost powder finish.
there's some brightening from the mica
texture when worn alone is nice
the featured "blend of optics" seem to be extremely tiny micro sparkles
loved the way it made my skin so smooth
it makes your skin very smooth
perhaps this is better for oilier complexions as i have combination skin
loved how silky the serum felt
didn't make my skin look any more "bright"
"pure luxury" made me somewhat starry eyed
the restoration of your glow
it's got a thicker texture than what you'd expect from a serum
the texture reminds me of an eye cream
the color of this product is pretty
however it definitely brightens my face
this is how poor the consistency and texture was.
did not make it look more radiant
it left my skin glowing
my face looked brighter after i used it
a little bit more smooth
my skin felt smooth
this mask makes my skin feel smooth
skin didn't really look or feel any smoother
gave me perfect glow
gives you a glowing beautiful complexion.
it makes my skin smooth
it does deliver on its promise to give you soft supple skin
it does tingle a little on application
my make-up seems to on smoother
it claims to visibly brighten
i didn't like the texture
makes my eyes look slighty worse.
i like the texture of this product
now the skin doesn't feel as smooth
the cream does not make the under eye look smooth
it does look like it brightens the area somewhat
i loved the way it made my skin look smooth
made my skin look great
my face texture was completely different
my face felt like fine sandpaper.
my skin also appeared matte
i definitely noticed my skin looking much brighter
it left my skin with a smooth
my face was glowing
my skin tone appears brighter
my skin felt smooth
your eyes look glowy.
the texture was also very refreshing.
overall it's a nice eye cream
didn't deliver on the dullness-to-radiance
this is a very nice eye cream.
makes the skin feel plump
made my face really supple
it does smooth over the skin nicely though.
the color looks way too dark on my pale nc15 skin
alpa assured me that this only gave a glow
i like the glow the product gives my skin
want a glow with spf
slightly darkens the skin
pinker color than my own skin tone
the tint makes that apparent
it tinted my skin a funny color
the tint capsules that are supposed to produce a flattering glow merely turned my skin muddy
i didn't feel difference in texture or see a more radiant mewas just another moisturizer for me
it softens your skin considerably
it brightens it too
would be my hg for brightening my skin
the 2 stars worth of pros: great texture
the texture is nice
the texture was immensely sticky.
feels good on -- light moisture
she said it really helps improve skin clarity
my face was super shiny
it makes my skin look
my skin looked wonderful
general brightening of the skin
the color changing effect is neat.
didn't notice any major radiance or brightness after regular use
it's enjoyable to use since the bubbling sensation feels cool
my skin did not become smoother or more beautiful
the texture is extremely weird
my skin did glow
it says it is brightening
what it actually does is it puts shimmer
also, it says it gives bursts of radiance.
was it made my face whiter than normal
this plus the shimmer
shine gives my face a very weird look
if u look in the light you will notice it has shimmer in the cream
looked in the mirror i noticed shimmer all over
so don't know if it actually brightens or if it just shimmer to make it look brightened
it claims to be brightening
my face does end up smoother
makes my skin soft and glowing.
my face texture is amazing
my skin was in decent shape before
smooth so my makeup looked very nice
made my skin breakout.
it leaves my skin shinier
the original gave my skin a shine
leaves a greasy texture on my skin
the texture is very odd
the consistency is pretty creamy for how thick the balm is
i prefer the texture
my skin does look brighter than before
the dissolving blue color was pretty neat.
it's very aesthetically pleasing to me
i don't have amazing skin but its smooth.
it helped a little texture
it's more thick texture
makes them look bigger because of the blue tint
it also started to change the texture of my skin
as far as complexion-brightening
recovers from dull skin textures
give it some glow
at times textured skin
this does an amazing job smoothing onto my skin.
was impressed by the texture of it
the texture is silky
smooth on my skin
noticed how smooth my face looked
feels like a silky primer
it makes my skin look
is most of the day pretty matte
it makes me very shiny
my face was very shiny
my skin actually looks much shinier with this on
makes my pores look bigger and my face shiny.
i don't feel like this really keeps my skin matte
matte to natural finish foundation over top of this
my makeup looks so cakey
my nose does not look shiny
also performs well under sun screen
i feel like sometimes it promotes texture on my skin
doesn't make my cheeks
it sits on top of your skin creating a weird fim layer
it's more like a primer with a similar on-skin texture to smashbox's iconic primer
this eye cream is totally underwhelming- provides some moisture
i like the texture of it
i gave it a try because i really like the light weight cream gel texture of this brightening mask
when i woke up i can visually tell my skin got brighter
so far it has made my skin smoother
also mads my face very oily and shiny
the texture feels more like a face cream
a really nice rich cream
radiant eye cream still continues
this is quite shimmery
the shimmers can't really be seen under foundation
not shimmery in a good
my face is shimmery all over like i am some sort of show dancer
i got the rose/blush
the look it gives my skin
i still want that healthy glow
the deal breaker for me is that its got tones of shimmer in it
i didn't see any smoothing or radiance
this has a nice texture
makes my skin appear dry as it accentuates lines
blurs out my skin imperfections
the consistency is very clumpy and thick.
it goes on very matte
creates a white cast on my skin
i agree the texture
really gave my skin an "airbrushed" look
this cream blurs well and looks great on.
leaves my skin so smooth
this definitely leaves a noticeable white cast
the texture is/feels cool
the way it smooths out my skin tone
my skin looked chalky
it also leaves a white hue
bumpy texture to the skin on my chin
the texture of it is not smoothing at all
it made me look gray
this sunscreen leaves a white cast on even very pale skin
its much easier to blend into the skin
leaves a really white cast on my skin
so forget darker skin tones
leaves a white cast even on my super fair skin
leaves me looking super white
the white cast of the sunscreen seemed to accentuate the flaky patches on my nose
it feels lovely upon application
i like its texture
it felt chalky, not smooth.
it did leave my face looking a tad brighter
it has not improved texture
does not make my face smoother
my entire jawline was dry
this mask did make my face appear brighter
the pinkish color is unique.
this is more of subtle mask
my skin looks plump
after 2 weeks my skin is smoother.
to the touch feels like hair gel.
it has a nice texture
it has a nice texture
i like that the texture is light weight
it hasn't left my skin smoother or changed my tone
i wouldn't say it helped with brightening
it definitely livened up my dull skin
the tone was brighter
it does give your face a glow
my face appears refreshed.
the appearance of my face is smoother
does not help my complexion
does not improve my skin's texture
i do seem to notice smoother skin
as i smooth it on
my skin was smoother
while my skin seem smoother on the days i used it
and i do feel that it brightened my complexion.
did not brighten my complexion
did not make my skin "luminous"
did not boost radiance
did not improve skin tone
only saw it brightened my complexion
then this brightening mask
overall the product did brighten my skin.
my complexion was very ruddy
the mask did help to smooth out my skin
my skin is really shiny all day.
it makes my skin shine
for the most part still textured
it is a nice refreshing mask
it gives your skin a blurred angelical effect
not so much radiance
more like a overal perfected look
tone of the eye cream is nice
will brighten the undereye
it's makes my skin matte
refreshing on the skin
it made my complexion soft
this will make your skin look matte at first
it seemed to make my skin look brighter
products that give me "glow" which i didn't feel this mask gave me much of a glowing or brightening effect
smooth on the skin
for me it just brightened
i think it does create a sort of radiant glow
i think for brightening
the texture is quite good
it does leave my skin smooth
my face did seem a bit brighter
seems to smooth up complexion around the face
i also tried adding it into my foundation to make my skin look more dewy
have the drops for radiance
he suggested pairing this with the radiance drops as he said my redness wasn't bad enough for the calming
i got the radiance one
i love the thick consistency
in 2 weeks my skin was smooth
i did notice my skin looked plumper after using this
the texture is nice
didn't brighten me up.
i got this because of the light texture.
a gel-like consistency that's a bit bouncy
this new gel balm seemed pretty neat
bouncy gel like texture
i love the way it makes my face look dewy
does not plump the skin as promises
i did like the texture
under my eye is smooth
the texture is light
i liked the texture
the texture is gross
seems to plump the skin a bit
it makes my skin very smooth
it does leave skin nicely toned
pink is nice as well
consistency of clay makes pink a bit harder to spread
my skin turned a pretty bright red
it's so creamy that it gets stuck in all your eyelashes
especially when it also promises luminous skin.
including their radiant deep brightening serum
the texture of my skin after just one week
the shimmer i think doubled with my face powder to give my face too much of a sheen
the texture is good
it left a very matte finish which i liked
the texture is a bit thick
this is a silky and smooth serum.
however is the only ingredient that "visibly brightens the eye area"
it makes my skin feel so smooth
the consistency of the cream
i instantly saw a brightness
it has a great texture that left your skin smooth
with a gel-like consistency
smooth it over your skin
liked the initial texture
it didn't smooth over my skin nicely
i prefer a luminous look.
there was an instant glow
just lovely, smooth, gorgeous skin.
just gorgeous, glowing skin.
didn't like the texture
i felt like it was a very nice texture
it was a brighter blue
shiny not necessarily "brighter" like it says in description
brightening look i was going for
skins feels a little bit brighter after the mask
texture is nice and refreshing.
tingles a bit so its working!
it is definitely soothing
my skin does look brighter after i've used it
slightly uneven skin tone
this eye cream feels great
while the texture is nice
the texture was good
this helped to brighten my skin
i don't feel like my complexion looks any different
it didnt make my skin seem brighter
my skin had gotten darker
the stuff works- the texture of my skin
even skin tone all takes place
it made my face darker
gave my face a orange dark tan look.
this really changed my face color to a different shade
would have toned my skin
everyone's skin is different
while this serum did make my skin smooth
the glowing kind of tan
my blush wouldn't go on evenly
skin looks better in the morning
the texture of this product is great
i really enjoyed the texture
super cool texture, easy delivery, very gentle.
overall i felt the shaving cream texture was a big gimmicky
different (in a positive way) texture!
my skin feels very dry and looks shiny.
maybe my skin looks tighter
i certainly liked the texture
the texture is very smooth
the moisture it brings helps my eyes feel less irritated
the only decent quality is the texture
it made my skin texture worse
this made my skin darker
i've noticed my skin is brighter
it hasn't brought about any dramatic changes to brighten/lighten up my darks spots
instead this gave me textured skin
as well as a weird texture
i also can't really vouch that it made my skin smoother
i will say that the texture is lovely
it looks like my skin is peeling
despite the beautiful blue hue
hard to smooth around balm
the texture is gross
i like it a lot for its consistency/texture
goes on smooth on your face
it feels completely luxurious.
it makes me look greasy.
it leaves my skin with a matte finish.
i like the texture of this
it is a little thinner than the original gel
i liked the texture
