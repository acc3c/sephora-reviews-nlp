these little patches blow all other products away
unsightly additions to my right eye area

never thought to use an eye cream
i started noticing some very faint lines below my eyes
fairly dry skin around my eyes
this is the first eye cream i have ever used that i am able to rub on my top eyelids
so every eye cream of my past would make my eyes swell just a little
finally i can care for the skin around my eyes.
really nice eye cream for younger people
for their first eye cream
has never irritated my eyes
i don't feel a burning sensation around my eyes like i have felt with other products
the ones under my eyes are also much less visible
this eye gel helped me reduce the appearance of the fine lines on my under eye
my dark sports around my eyes are diminishing
in the past year i have noticed that my eyes are much puffer
darker than ever before
less puffy in a few days
this eye cream is great for both nighttime
wrinkles under my eyes making me look much older than i am
i even think my dark circles appear lighter
my dark circles seem lighter
it doesn't have any effect on darkness or wrinkles
so this is a nice eye cream for times that my undereye area looks
fine lines are smoothing out
dark circles are now not as apparent in the morning
it cleared up the dark circles
de-puffs my eyes in the morning without irritating my very sensitive
crinkles right underneath my lower lashes that really bothered me
the crinkles are gone
the fine lines under my eyes aren't quite as noticeable
my dark circles are a little less dark
now my under eyes are no longer dry
the wrinkles that were forming are softening noticeably
cooling on the eye area
they look darker in the morning well
no tugging,no tightness.
i can already see my eyes becoming less puffy
i can already see my eyes becoming not so puffy.
by next morning the little bumps were gone
my face felt ice cold
i also feel like this is a dupe for the fresh rose petal face mask
slight tingle at first.
first of all when it hits your face it's the most soothing
the jar is too small for a mask
my face is simply glowing.
i stretched it out to 3 generous uses
i've managed to keep major wrinkles at bay
seems to soften the face
the smaller spots have almost faded away
the darker ones are less noticeable
uva rays will just make your dark spots more prominent
by using a dark spot corrector you can remove the spots already visible
my sun spots are fading
i read about how this serum removes dark spots in 7 days
i feel like my dark spots from acne are already almost gone
some spots are definitely diminishing
after only a week scars were starting to lighten on my face
along with a lot of spf
careful with the bump
it says to avoid the eye area
along my jaw line
which means i am always bouncing between oily
my skin was noticeably less red
is still super light
perhaps a littler brighter as well
to my amazement no dry skin at all
use on my legs
it has a little highlighter pot on top of the tube thats also a nice golden tone
it also has the extra little highlighter too
just under my eyes towards the top of my ear
a little "spark" to your face
the flash illuminators have a much better texture as a cream highlight than whatever was thrown into the cap of this
i received a shade a bit too dark
it comes with a little extra product on the lid for more glow
cheekbones when i'm getting ready in a hurry
it thinned out my foundation just a bit
as a dark skinned woman
i also used it on my lip for an ombré affect
not orange at all
i usually put a little extra on my cheekbones.
the highlighter in the cap is a little too dark for my skin tone
just a little streak across the top of my cheekbones when i'm getting fully "done up"
the tiny highlighter hidden in the cap makes this product great for travel
the cap has a touch-on beam creme to highlight key areas on your face
the highlight in the bottom of the cap is a little waxy for my liking
the highlight in the bottom of the cap is a little waxy for my liking
just focused the product on the parts of my face that i wanted to glow
not to mention the highlighter attached in the lid is beautiful too
the tip of my nose
the color was a little bit off for me
i also apply it to my neck to aadd some shimmer.
or alone to just look naturally glowing
on days that i'm not wearing lots of powder
i love that when you flip the cap there is targeted beam creme that i just glide on or sometimes use my finger to apply
look a little sun-kissed
it was light weight and very sheer.
the glow in the cap is hard to reach
i just use my fingers
i felt like a mermaid at times because how much it shimmered
the concentrated highlighter stick under the cap is awesome
i also love the cream in the flip cap
the highlighter in the cap was a good idea
i wore it under light powder foundation
i've only been using it on my body to highlight collar bone
this cream is a little too dark to use all over my face
it's a little hard to press the tip on your cheekbone to highlight as the cap can get in the way
i simply rubbed my finger to get some product
then patted the finger onto my cheekbone
as someone who is light-skinned
the bridge of my nose when i don't wear any foundation
lit from within glow
youthful with this sitting underneath any foundation
i tend to get somewhat pale in the winter.
otherwise, it looks orange on me.
the colour is a little orange
it's a mature "lit from within" look
that you can pull off gold glow
the gold flecks collected in the lines around my mouth
e rubbing the foundation off or sitting too thick on top of foundation
it covers the trouble spots
a little across the collarbone
chest to give a pretty glow
you're literally wearing gold on your skin.
great on my arms when wearing a sleeveless top too
also, you notice right away tighter skin.
i dab on top of my regular foundation for highlight
itchy in the exact spots where i applied it
seriously you would need to examine my face with a microscope to find a speckle
it also does in fact seem to camouflage small spots or discolorations
i notice my smile lines aren't as prominent when i use it
even deeper wrinkles have softened
i didn't have a dry spot in sight
my skin tingled the first couple of times i used it
this is gentle enough for my children's faces
my dark circles are lighter for the first time.
i only use this eye cream during my morning routine because it soothes my tired/puffy eyes
i hate sticky eyes
doesn't feel like i'm wearing eye cream.
my dark circles are genetically inherited
especially around my eyes
which i love for the orbital area of the eye because it won't cause milia
i've flirted with so many eye creams over the years
i've always had little tiny fine lines under my eyes
not like that crazy woke up with 6 big pimples
just use a tiny bit for those areas
each new product invited large cystic bumps on my face
dried out my face like a bumpy
cracks especially in the winter months
face were dried out more than usual
areas on my skin
was always left with small white flakes on my skin
once i tried this one no more white flakes!
a bit too heavy for summer though
warm it up between my finger tips real good before pressing it into my skin
usually have to blot continually throughout the day
get bad flaky patches
started looking more wrinkly
my big dry patches are gone
more on the dry side esp under my eye
face cream is great for keeping the dry patches at bay
although it may seem a bit on the creamy-heavy side
growing up i've struggled with oily skin
my skin has recently become dry all around
ive always had issues with dark circles
just a little bit of this product has lightened my dark circle
my under eyes look 30
it did help somewhat with dark circles/puffiness in my under-eye area
it was not stinging or irritating to my eyes at all
used only a tiny bit
after only a few uses the dark circles under my eyes are gone
doesn't do anything for brightening or dark circles
under my eye has more fat or something now because there isn't much of a hollow circle around my eyes
don't have too many issues with my under eyes except for puffiness
occasional dark circles from a lack of sleep
sleep has become a bit rare for me so my under eye area has left me looking much like the walking dead
have natural lines under my eyes
yet my fine lines
wrinkles have erased away as if by magic
there under my eyes
eye area is already really soft
helps with every eye concern.

excessive sweating on my face
dry on the nose areas
others i'd have dry patches
then rubbed it in more with my fingers

no stinging or irritation when it's applied.
started getting a lot of black heads
i also like to apply it underneath sheet masks for an extra boost of goodness
dry patches that my foundation tends to get hung up on
my skin has gradually become less red
my cheeks were horribly inflamed
my undereye fine lines were literally cracked
the dry spots on my face really are pronounced more
my skin looked congested
my pores even appear to be getting smaller.
after applying the tingle was really intense
i tend to pat on two pumps all over my face
this has helped clear up dry patches on my face with daily use
still have plenty left
it makes you skin feel like angels have kissed it
i doesn't sit on top of my face heavily it is very lightweight
whereas the blue one had no scent at all
i'll be red immediately after but it fades.
a few times a week i use the glamglow mask on my nose
more like a serious mask
like most of their masks
my face was a little tight
dry skin on either sides of my nose
looked as if i had two black eyes
not only did it help brighten my dark circle

put on my fresh black tea eye cream on top of this
no burning or stinging with my sensitive eyes.

om dry spots around my nose
just under my bottom lip
it is a very thin consistency which becomes milky white when the two parts are shaken together

lots of other creams have made my eyes water throughout the day

first i color correct the dark circles
my under eyes no longer look tired

irritated under eye area all winter
the slight cooling sensation on my under eyes
was giving me milia around my eyes because of that
i struggle with dry
wake up with a much brighter
all skins are different!
sensitive skin with some dry patches around my mouth
this moisturiser is the only thing that keeps me from looking like a snake shedding its skin
rub it in in circles
my nose has always been my problem area for dry skin
while it turns to be hotter
tired all the time lately
causing small bumps all over my face
it keeps those dry patches at bay
i put all over my eyelids all the way up to the brow bone
i've always had a couple of dry patches on my forehead
not a glittery over done highlight
it made my face actually a bit too shiny
i wore this on bare skin and under foundation.
the soft glow, on naked skin, perks you right up.
it kind of calls attention to it by adding shimmer to it
also on my neck
shoulder areas when i wore my sleeveless dress
when i do it's hourglass veil
also looks lovely on my chest and collar bones.
i've worn it everyday since.
saw they had a darker shade
the glow is not over the top
i just use it under my eyes
adds just the right amount of glow without being glittery
my face looks dull or pale i just slap on some of this beauty in a jar
i just end up looking sweaty and gross.
just out a tiny bit of concealer over problem areas like my under eyes
it applied nicely without streaking or finger print lines that tends to happen to me
i just have too many scars
it also tightened my skin nicely.
it tightens the look of the under eye.
even some of the deeper ones disappear
my cheek area is also less saggy.
dark spots on my skin
the scar from breaking out start fading
i noticed that i started getting white bumps around
the white bumps disappeared
i now only use it on my cheeks
since using it on my cheeks
just keep the layer very light
the dry skin has disappeared
i started using this on my red flaky skin
it's slightly scary to see it on the shower wall at first
forth between products that are gentle enough not to tear up my sensitive skin
all left my face irritated
make it even more red
my breakouts are almost completely gone
have enough abrasion to definitely remove the little bit of dead skin on the top
the only part of my face that flakes is my nose
bumps on my forehead
my breakout is receding, the bumps, barely there.
leaning more towards dry
visibly a little brighter than before
plump after every use
it doesn't sting my face at all

amount to cover my face
spots on my cheeks
now on the primer side
to use as a small blur effect
this actually blurs when worn under foundation
it is a little thick
it improved my dark circle
at first it seemed really watery
seemed to control the oily parts of my face
may be too much for sensitive noses
excellect firming for my face.
not noticing much on my neck and chest.
it helped to soothe my angry dry patches
ias my twenties are slowly receding behind me
i still saw less pep in my skin
flaky on certain areas
heavy enough to let a red spot pop up on areas where i am already more prone to oil
my skin is so dry it has shrunk
eye bags that seemed permanently etched into my skin are not as dominant
it's also light enough as an eye cream
i tap it around my eye area
eyes has been very pleasantly surprising
i suggest patting it onto your face then massaging like the directions state
leaves your skin/under eye area looking fresh
also it's an eye cream as well.
one pump is enough for my face and neck as well.
i've done diy egg white masks on my face in the past
fresh while wearing this
dry patches under my eyes
even under my eyes
i initially felt a little burning sensation in my eyes
leaning towards oily in the summer
more on the oily side
or on top of any small area of irritated skin
some days it’ll be as parched as the sahara desert
my skin seems calmer as far as breaking out
chin tend to get really shiny while my cheeks are dry
especially near my nose
does a great job of controlling the oil on my forehead
then pat it on my forehead
my skin was too tight from this in the colder months
my main problem area however is the crevasses of my nose
as that happened i have slowly been adjusting my potions at home for my new glowing skin
fine lines around my eyes are noticeably less visible
my pores were barely visible
i usually blot at least 3-8 times a day to the point where i end up rubbing my contour on my nose off from the excessive blotting because i'm that oily
so now i wake up without an oul slick in my forehead
the few dark sports i have
it's thick enough i just pump onto my finger then spread on my face
they were immeadiatly less red
my pores looked smaller and felt tighter.
i used it on my lips
bumps from my breakout/ black heads/white heads
noticing my pore looking smaller
just like others said i rubbed it on gently all over my face used it as a mask
my white heads are gone
left my face soft
especially on my cheeks
so far, though, i'm all smiles!
since the black charcoal masks are all the rave right now
it was so dark
there was a plastic very pointy neddle-like thing in the center that scratched my face
chin area have visibly diminished
you just swipe it all around the face in circular motions
more like glide this over your face
the mask lifted my most problem areas
had no issues with peeling it off
it did tingle a little at first
peeling it off made my eyes water slightly
i mainly had it on my nose
it was pretty fast fora peel off mask
it does also fade out as the mask behinds to dry
you're left pulling lots of little bits off
it made my eyes water
a face cloth to get all the pieces off
since it burned my eyes
it says keep away from brows
part of the tail of my brow
really who would apply a peeling mask to a fragile area like the eyes?
i applied it to my forehead between my brows
unfortunately i had a few damp areas left
dry areas on my face
all without harsh rubbing
my breakouts are almost completely gone
it is a little irritating in the small crevasses around my nose
out of trouble face mask
it's leaves a white/grey cast on my face
a small pump of this murky brown
with in days my face has a glow
the tea leaves at the bottom are definitely present in the smell
the green tea leaves floating at the bottom of this is super fun too look at
my face had irritated
dry red patches all over it
om little breakouts or spots on my face
including those green leafs that are in it
mostly on my nose
can sting the eyes though.
this face mask is such a hidden gem!
i've tried so many different face masks
leaning more to the oily side lately
not tight at all
then normal skin in my forehead
my pores are also noticeable smaller too.
there are also tiny beads in it
like to splash my face a bit with water
my pores were also noticeably smaller.
lid is so pretty
especially next to my nose
i've also noticed my skin's fine lines fading
i pump out half of a pump of the line release under eye repair cream dab in the center of my under eye where the soft tissue is between the lower lash line not to go down to upper cheek bone
by using all three products my deep under eye wrinkles
crows feet are still visible
oil areas around my nose
dab on the troubled area
helps lift droopy eyes as each product is slightly different however
i always hated how dirty my enlarged pores looked
pores are now hardly visible
already my pores look a lot smaller.
like i blot my face multiple times a day
baggy skin under my eyes
there is a "blurring" of fine lines
even after one use my skin felt more firm especially around my forehead region
it left my face itchy
i found that using it on my cheeks
my forehead gets very patchy
love that it seems to be smoothing out some of my age lines
i couldn't see the tiny lines at all!
which they hide with that paper cover
the other one was really eye catching
it did not blur my eyes or burn
balances which left my skin too tight
i like to rub it in with my fingers
am currently *literally* scraping the bottom of it
sometimes a little more on the dry side
less ruddy or red
while this keeps my oily spots from getting out of control
rough patches or lines
patted in to the areas my face that show lines when i wear make up
it helps makeup glide on over those parts so they appear less wrinkled
the bags under my eyes are gone
middle fingers of one h
middle fingers of one h
light enough for my nose
no white cast, no smearing, no problems!
it keeps me from being shiny all day.
it can sting a little bit
my dark spots are fading.
i put a little between my finger
rub it to warm it up a little between the fingers of the h
it has lightened up my dark spots
turning my skin red
it doesn't irritate my eye area
eyelashes without worrying that it'll harm your delicate eyes
with just a few pumps
on a whim just to try it on this massive zit on my face
i put a little bit on my zit
my scars have lightened
my bumps are almost all gone
my face was always peeling
an underground zit on my check that actually had a visual hole at the top i can no longer feel under my cheek
to give a little bit of a background
some blemishes were gone completely
the others were softer
most were just smooth red dots
once rubbed into the skin it's barely noticeable
i am almost getting a little bit teary-eyed talking about this product because of the change it has made
suffered from a few dark spots on my cheeks
it really gets rid of those embarrassing little red bumps aka razor burn
milia around my chin
already see my big pimple is getting smaller
the spots are fading!
congested pores for so long since my early teens
masks weren't cutting it
my face was more even in tone
along with the occasional whitehead flare-up
i've had clear skin my whole life aside from a pimple or two here
flesh colored bumps that always remain on my face
i still will get the occasional flare up
two on my cheeks that usually take weeks before the "head" of the pimple will reveal itself
black heads are slowly dissapearing
tried quite a few to cover my problem areas
keeps it from getting super patchy from dry spots
even got ride of the blackheads on my nose that i've had for forever
i even mix a drop of this into foundations sometimes
i just use it for my chin
now i occasionally have a superficial whitehead during that time of the month
glowing since using it
as i've gotten older they have moved to my jawline
my face purged a little bit
my once congested skin is now clear
it cleared up my breakouts on my forehead that has been wreaking havoc on me
i occasionally get breakouts in my t-zone
dark spots lightening up
cleared tiny lil bumps on my face that i can never get to go away
i should be a mess with several painful bumps already
it is so light
end up looking really shiny
i rubbed some of this on
i would break out along my hairline
then i found this little green bottle of magic
3-4 drops is plenty enough to spread across the face
i no longer get the small pimples around my chin area
shrunk the ones that are left
ive only had one deep pimple as opposed to several a week
at first i found this mask to be chunky
i've used a lot of brightening mask
burning sensation like many other masks
just a little over $20 an ounce *sad face*.
it felt like your face is shrinking
i still give this mask 5 stars
my skin is very fair with the tendency toward ruddiness
rather than leaving my skin angry
best face mask for brightening the face
i even ate a little bit gel
there are little parts of the crushed fruit in the mask
it brought some nice colour to my cheeks too
it's a close second to the black tea instant perfecting mask
the chunks of fruit are a bit off putting
some red spots have faded
it evens out my extremely red cheeks
dark mom under eye circles
instantly my dark undereye circles were gone
my bags looked a bit more volumized
or came in a small size... hint hint!
my face felt tighter
i like trying different masks.
i can put up with that for glowing skin.
skin was turning slightly red by then.
my cheeks looks like they are swelling
at first sight i was a little put off it pretty much resembles orange marmalade
i found myself to have the same peachy glow moments after i washed off the mask
a little difficult to spread around
my cheeks look lifted
my forehead looks like i've never been grumpy
nothing for the forehead lines until i tried this gem
i tried everything to get rid of dark spots
then was left with dark spots
it's been like an eraser for the dark spots
just waiting for the scars to vanish completely then will give 5 stars
the only reason i gave it four stars is because it irritates my eyes a little bit
small white heads would line my jaw line.
it actually looked like it has a more pink under tone than anything
after it sits on your skin a little bit it starts to bring some color to your face
then i smooth it out in a circular motion around my entire eye area
this stuff really does do a good job at hiding dark circles because of the diamond dust
well rested while wearing this
split it between both eyes
puffy eyes have diminished
little just under the eye
lately i just look fresh
if you extend it a little further toward your temples
has a slight coverage for dark circles or blue in the inner eye
it sometimes leaves some white stuff around my eyes
face masks often on for a while
but it do nothing to the dark circle.
with this one the consistency is already thick
decided to try this mask because i have red blotches
me being pale they show a lot
purple blotches on my skin fade away
it keeps my spots under control
it has little shimmering left after you peeled it off
the scars were lighter
i applied it on the parts of my face that needed brightening
i find it to help my small hooded eye look more lifted
bordering extremely fine micro glitters
help with puffy under eyes and darkness.
my eyes no longer look puffy or tired.
my undereye area was looking rough
i've tried their genius eye cream
then slick on another layer if my eyes are feeling super puffy or i've been burning the c
which reflects light off of my hereditary dark circles
still have a tiny bit left
mostly on my chin like right under my lip
the overall appearance of the tiny whiteheads on the rest of my face
just a small background about my skin.
my pores seemed bigger for a little while after
looked in the mirror
the jar is quite large
only downfall, is this thing burns!
your face feels like you rubbed too faced lip injections all over your face
i just massaged it in using circling motions
his cheeks are red

farmacy is starting to slowly grow into my 'favorites' for troubled skin
no stinging or burning!
i've always had a few bumps here
the skin is dry, cracked and patched badly.
applied all over face neck
lips since i've been dry
a little warming sensation a lot like warm water hitting your face
staring at the cute little jar i decided to try it
the warming sensation is just right
woke up with glowing skin
it does have a warming sensation which can sting a little
the less i feel the warming or stinging
my face burned like a thous
the next day my makeup looks even more sharp
it also made my forehead wrinkle less noticeable the day after i use the mask
eye are is extra sensitive
am leery of many masks
it pulled out all my clogged pores on both sides of my nose under my eyes
all those little breakouts on my forehead were going away
black heads are leaving in bedded dirt is going away
like a new pimple every other day this has really prevented my skin from breaking out i still have some scars
the ones on my forehead cleared up instantly
barely any blemishes have popped up
all my blemishes are now flat or gone
tend to break out around my bra area
i recently had a bad breakout on my cheek/jaw line
their max complexion pads just in the area of concern
you only need a tiny bit to use as a highlighter.
not even a third of the size of a pea to highlight cheekbones
a dot on nose forehead
less is more to really play up a cat eye with megawatt lashes
i feel like it just smears it all around my eyes
i got these nasty crusty dry patches near my mouth
my crows feet have gotten better
am creeping up on 40
plumping are good words in my world
no rough patches and it looks healthy!
it tingles for the first few seconds
this winter unfortunately has wreaked havoc on my skin
omly thought of those fine lines that were along my forehead
around my laugh lines
sunken skin under my eyes that disappeared soon after application
red/inflamed due to cold weather
soften those less-than-fine-lines
no dry patches, no tight spots.
i usually have dry flakey patches of skin around my mouth
eyebrows that eventually turn dark
there are no dry spots
a little goes a long way if you dot small amounts over your face
people have noticed my skin looking more plumped
then dabbing on a bit of water made a huge impact
then slowly help fading my scar
dark spots have faded significantly in just a week
it also has really balanced out my faces dry
it keeps my face from getting breakouts
going to try other black pine products!
face any body in one bar!!!
i feel like i'm on a cloud
no tingling or tightening feeling during the wait
i imagined myself going to bed with streaks of black goop on my face
right away i could see a glowing swath of skin where the mask wiped off
i actually prefer to use it flat with the triangle parallel to my skin rather than using the edge like a razor
one of the deep expression lines on my forehead almost disappears after using
i preferred to spread with my fingers.
watching the magnet suck up all of the mask
blurs those tiny lines
3 as outlined in the flaps when you open it
mask comes clean off when it makes contact with triangle
my chin is so dry from a recent cold
wrap your magnet in a tissie then hover it over your face to remove he mask
my lines on my face is visually less visible
the fine lines under my eyes have lessened significantly as well as my forehead
i did just a portion of my forehead
so pretty heavy with wrinkles
the only thing that is better is the fresh black tea mask
the forehead lines were noticeably more shallow
i lightly touched the bare magnet to my face
softened-- like seriously smoothed
the technology on the mask its mind blowing
tiny bumps on my face
i've tried so many masks

the lines that were spreading across my forehead are gone
some small lines that are starting to form from expressions

never wanted to be seen bare faced because i had dark dots all over
bridge of my nose because i too afraid to draw attention to it

it gets rid of the red undertones in my face
apply it with my finger
such a small amount covered my rosy cheeks perfectly
rolled my eyes because nothing had ever made my bright red blotchy cheeks
all i need to do now is dab some in a patting motion
was worried that this only comes in one shade
it is a little on the dark side
as well as other small blemishes
covers every last ounce of the red in my ruddy skin
so this actually tones it down
only gave 4 stars because without the cc cream it dried me out a tiny bit
very small amounts cover up the redness on my face as well
it completely covers the area around my nose that is red
emphasized a few dry patches on my face
just this as a base on my nose
fingers work well too!
my cheeks are always quite red
it also left a slight white cast
- don't be put off by the dark shade.
i dab on a little of this on my checks
the occasional blemish that might appear
i put a few dots on my cheeks
on my cheeks it's magic
my face is red above the jawline
after my skin care regime i use a few dots of this over my face

i can finally start on a blank canvas instead of a splotchy red one
some days more severe flare ups

i've actually used this to hid a spider vein on my leg
the tiny jar just doesn't last very long.
area around my nose
my chin are always red
now i just use this to cover the red patches
i've struggled with the ugly green color correctors
two spots covers each side of my face
the are still visible
don't even have shades light enough
still use it because its a lot easier to lighten my skin then cover bright red
it is matte, however after awhile it will crease.
i love using this product to cover my dark circles
my dry patches were under control
particularly on my forehead
blur my eyes constantly
the jar looks big
it is very gentle especially around the eyes.
creaky this is without being greasy

this helped with my dark under eye bags.
i also feel like my under eye area became less puffy

bumps on my forehead
get flare ups a lot
it has almost completely healed the bumps

i wake up with less "bumps"
my makeup is so much smoother all over my trouble areas
sometimes all over my face
i like to thin mine down with a few drops of light facial oil
kept my dry patches down

reputation through word of mouth
use it as an eye cream now which completely transforms my under eye circles
really prevents them from leaving a lingering red mark
raw spots on my cheeks
the spots were completely healed
this stuff is on the thicker side
my dry patches have disappeared
red from the irritation
they even out my complexion

this has kept the rash at bay
saves way more than just our fingers pressing this tube

i've also tried the cicapair tiger grass color correcting treatment which is different
the spots on the left side were significantly smaller
the white patchy skin i would get around my mouth completely disappeared
next morning my face looked much more even toned with less redness
this stuff transformed my skin overnight.
i wore mask over mask
when i woke up in the morning some of my new blemishes were noticeably smaller
used as a spot treatment for a horrible dry patch on the side of my chin that showed up out of nowhere it's been a month like that
when irritated, it gets red and stays red.
my skin is much less red
especially in my chin area
my dry patches were gone
not even a little roughness on my forehead where i'm perpetually dry
nose have been very red
since i'm only 20 i don't use an eye cream
i'll be smearing it around my eyes too every night
lightly dot all over my face
i just make sure to dot on the bad places
so they are colorless
i've literally tried everything to get rid of the consistent red bumps
i've noticed my face gets a little more oily throughout the day now
i could see this leaving a pale wash on the face
yet still covers my blemishes
if you are fair skinned with red
my problem was so severe that most people would stare
dab a few dots of this all of my face
concentrating in my t-zone where the redness is worst
no irritated eyes from rubbing
it really works miracles when it comes to my red patches
not thick or heavy
heat bumps on my forehead when i get too much sun
whenever i get these bumps on my forehead
was the only sun screen i wore
it totally works to remove/cover red spots
with as many red areas as i have
especially in my cheeks
dusting of my favorite pressed powder to even things out
bobbi brown sheer in white
not much red coverage
for darker skin that still shows a lot of pink
with red undertones that regular foundation never really seemed to cover correctly
i dapple it on my redder areas
if you are the girl with red cheeks at the gym
while this covers my red spots usually pimple scars or just red little patches it also gives me a great amount of coverage i love it
my chest is naturally red
it was too orange for me
this goes on green
is starting to get "ruddy" as i age
a little goes a long way to even out my reddish skin
i also use it for my dark circles, amazing!!
it comes out a little too pale to wear without something on top
the seemingly permanent red bumps on my forehead had disappeared
there is no green cast at all left.
especially around my nose
i just dot a concealer over the red spots.
i am now head over heels in love with this tiger grass treatment
just the tiger grass treatment
my cheeks are pretty pink
sometimes i put a bit of powder on top
the spots have vanished
which hides most of my spots
to my surprise this cream kept my face pretty matte throughout the day
without leaving a green tint
that i did best by using a chubby round brush that is flat on the end
i get red under my nose
have small veins around my mouth
it even takes the purple out of my dark circles.
rubbing it in makes it appear in orange like streaks on my face
leaving my face to be all red
it goes on green
even the most glued-on stuff
yet a bit too thick to spread evenly
it won't sting your eyes for eye makeup either.
i get nasty little dry patches on my cheekbones from them
even my eye make up without irritating my eyes
hated it because it would cloud my eyes
then take two dime sized dollops for the rest of my face
skin around my eyes gets easily irritated with other products
all eye make-up
rub it all over my face
including my dark blue
i read the directions and rubbed it on my face.
struggle with carrying eye make up remover around
my eyes are so sensitive that everything i've ever tried to remove eye makeup irritates my eyes to no end
for the eye make up
little bit to spread it all over the face
i'll typically follow up with the deep poor stick
wiping around my eye area
rubbed over my face
it spread around like a balm.
didn't hurt my lips or skin
dry spots on my face for a long time
nothing was making the dry spots disappear
splash the water onto my face several times
when i noticed that the dark patches around my mouth
more on the oily side
pat the mask in
s in to the bowl with some tsubaki splash mask in it
the lines are gone
i got to try this from the most recent power of the petals set i have dehydrated
reduced some fine lines
at some parts of my face
some fine wrinkles around eyes
the wrinkle lines around my mouth instantly disappeared the first time i applied the cream with the little quantity i used
the wrinkles around my eyes are better
that almost look like scars
more on the drier side
wake up with super soft
that are hard to conceal
my skin goes through a weird phase during season changes so my cheeks have been on the flaky side while my t-zone area has been borderline oily--
my bumps were gone
just put a light layer of this on top
i rotate between this
the said that wrinkles have started tightening on her arms specifically
the lack of scent is a plus in my eyes!
it looks flawless in the morning when i usually look like an overtired raccoon
get in my eyes
the tiniest bit of this balm goes a super long way
my fine wrinkles have softened as well.
i am fine with this around my eyes
's face cream awhile back
has elimated the dry patches i had
i get particularly dry around the cheeks
a very small amount rubbed between the palms will give you good coverage

the dark circles were noticeably faded.
it definitely brightened my under eye circles after just a couple uses
i notice a slight tingling for a few seconds
my fine lines were starting to fade
from all the tugging
my eyes are lifted.
it's hard to use retin-a around the eyes
on my crows feet
the creepy skin i had around my eye was all of a sudden looking smoother
the moisture around my eye area is significantly better
softening of those little lines
even puffy in the tops of my cheeks.
i used this once and my dry patches disappeared .
i've barely made a dent in the oversized tube.
which no lip balm or mask could ever fix
my lips have never felt better
usually about two thin layers on my face
that night i had 4 raw patches around my mouth.
chest since due aging i got a bit of skin darkening on my chest
the tightening of my neck
to the point where it flakes
uncomfortable in the summer
no tugging or stinging
it takes off make-up extremely well without scratching
when i get stressed my eyelids start looking like a desert
it takes hardly any product to cover both eyes
just pat it a couple times with one fingertip
even when my eyelids were dry
little tiny dark grey spots appear
less dark spots showing up as it dries
virtually had no dark spots appear as the mask dried
it removed the whitehead from a tiny pimple that i've had on my face for months
where they are famous for their clay masks
this little pot catches my eye
has helped with my smile lines
it sits on the top of your skin
which left my face red
i also had quite a bit of texture around my nose
both face and hands have to be dry.
specifically my crows feet
my laugh lines looked deeper
i used it mostly for my crows feets

especially under my nose
flaky patches are gone
t's super helpful to my dry areas around my nose
i slathered this on a couple times
its a really rich cream that creates little white patches at first
my dry red patches have completely disappeared
i woke up with such soft skin.
almost like a lightly mask.
my face was so bright
my uneven skin tone is starting to even day by day
mostly oily with some mild flakiness in the colder months
this turns very white on the face
the bottom of my nostrils was very irritated due to blowing my nose so much after i came down with a head cold
let it absorb before massaging in the last few patches
then press my palms onto my face.
despite being so thick
giving me little white bumps on my face
the tip about leaving a white layer on your face works wonders overnight
dry months to stop the flaky dry skin from rearing its ugly head
was on the hunt for anti aging that didn't bug my poor eyes
it doesn't bug my eyes one bit.
it's light weight on my face
noticing some smile lines around my eyes
yes including eye lids
now obsessed with face
it's basically the same tech from the blue diamond line
am prone to dry patches
which kept my skin mostly clean
clean without making it red
using the duo has gotten rid of the dry patches
noticed that it helps control my red
i get a lot of congestion on my nose
since i stared using this cleansing duo i have hardly had to use my harsh exfoliators at all
my skin issues are clearing quickly
my pores seemed so much smaller
usually around winter time my face would have dry patches around my nose
have never gravitated toward the darker
the corners of the bar soap are great for the corners of the nose
shoulders for almost a month now
my face has noticeably cleared up more
i still have mixed feelings on the bar
i got the detox which can be a little intimidating seeing the black bar at first
although the product seems tiny
it has tiny holes that let the water out
t doesn't look like an eye sore
this will be a staple in my facial routine moving forward
pairs nicely with the more intense soap
the "proof was in the pudding" when i dried my face with a bright white towel
just the bar is too small
the neck cream is the best i ever used.
a little unsure about the bar soap
i often poured too much
the dry air is taking a noticeable toll on my skin
the oil was light
with the little tray to keep the bar from getting gross
i feel like rubbing your fingers on the bar
rubbing the bar directly on your face makes the bar go by faster
mostly dry except for my forehead which is a little oily
mainly in the cheek
stuff deep down in my skin
normal with a slightly more oily t-zone
my skin feels more awake due to the massing of the oil into my skin
after using this product i've notice that my black heads have minimised
just a little awkard rubbing a soap bar all over my face
as a darker skinned black woman
living in the north east means fall my skin starts to really struggle
soft like a baby's bottom
i've always been very lax about washing my face
the cheeks were fine
rub that all over the face
or a smaller hole/ability to squeeze it out of that rather than pouring it out because pouring the oil out of the larger size hole at the top did get a little messy
the videos show you rubbing the bar on your face
after using this product i've notice that my black heads have minimised
not been extremely red
clearing up some red
i actually realized that the zit that was coming out on my chin was diminishing
the roughness of my face is gotten lessen as well
it felt like a slight stinging warm sensation as i first apply the mask
the fact that it is a green grainy mask also adds a bit of i actually quite like the scent
feeling rosy is probably my favorite mask of all time
my smile lines were completely gone
it even got rid of most of my forehead lines
noticed my friends are getting bags or dark circles or fine lines under their eyes
omg the dark circles are gone

sagging under eyes then this will be amazing for you
my dry patches completely disappeared

a bit obsessed with avoiding fine lines
i always suffer a dry patches under my eyes
my dark circles fairly dark

i still get flaky patches
in the morning my lips are smooth
just a small small dab on the back of my h
i put this stuff on mixed with tea tree oil just in the area of the pimple/breakout
it's the best product i've come across for dry/cracked lips
any place where skin is cracked or raw
i mistook it for lip balm
the type where my nose had been rubbed raw to the point where the skin was peeling
surrounding areas are chronically dry
flaky in some places
the dry patches are diminishing
feels like olive oil when sitting on the skin
it's great for rough skin on other parts of the body

noticed that there were literal sparkles scattered all over my face
where i would normally highlight my brow bone
after taking some flash-photos
look strange on my face at all
it's highly concentrated with the glitter
shoulders if i'm going out
then shine on you crazy diamond
it is not glitter chunk filled like some reviewers have suggested
i can put it just at the tops of my cheekbones for a highlighted look or all over for an all over healthy glow
as far as the glitter goes yes there is glitter in it
focusing mainly on the cheeks
it's also not got glitter chunks in it.
felt like it helped with the dryness around my eyes
some say it has chunks of glitter
was a little nervous because a lot of people reviewed it as too glittery
by no means am i into glitter or strobing
sallow in these winter months
down the bridge of my nose

sometimes i do notice a few white patches on my forehead where i didn't pat the product in completely
i did notice some white residue-like stuff on the edges of my face where the product ends
on the evenings when i've used these to take off multiple layers of eye make-up

the eye cream is just average
rotate it with a few others
also pulled the trigger on the serum as my skin looks very bright

a small rash under my nose
before looking in the mirror
inflame that little patch
my pores were starting to look large
dark spots on my face
year round black heads
my pores seem to have gotten larger looking as i've aged
it took 2 -3 weeks to feel the slight burn or tingle as i had a lot of dead skin to get through
all of the little bumps on my face are starting to go down
so far through the end of the week i've had lots of tiny white heads come out which i figure its my skin purging
more white heads came to the surface
my main problem is blemishes below skin which never really surface
they just stay as tiny light red bumps which annoy me
the darker ones have faded significantly
my scars are smaller
i will say i've noticed a lot of freckles surface since i started using

the cream is on the heavier side
just yesterday i had 2 huge dry patches
one around my mouth
one on my eyelid
recommended it to me because after 2 years of having horrible dry patches on her cheeks
lately my skin has gone nuts
evened out some color spots
it was to the point where my cheeks were so red they constantly looked sunburned
the texture was destroyed due to a lot of white heads
other then on my eyebrows where my face gets slightly dry
the product is mostly yellow with a tint of green
has erased my flaky patches

just a little dab goes a long way
i've even got a bit of glow going on!

although a little on the pricey side
imperfections on my face
i've found that applying a small amount to the areas that i would like to "blur" underneath my foundation
i can add a tiny bit more to trouble areas that need extra blurring
i used it on my forehead
left me very patchy looking
especially those around my nose
alone gives the blur effect
it's like walking around with a filter on
if i'm getting fine lines
it cuts down on shine and is super lightweight.
i've worn it both ways
all the fine lines
were noticeably blurred out
a little odd after applying it with you finger tips
pair this with the ibuki quick fix mist
i only use about a dime amount around my nose

it really helps with covering up lines under my eyes
just dab some of this on the spots that need refining
say goodbye to fine lines and makeup creases!
then smooth all over face with a brush
i loved how this really blurred some imperfections on my skin
it still smoothed them over
i didn’t have to blot at all
it was a great "primer" product to smooth out the laugh lines around my mouth
the foundation stuck around longer on my nose
helped with limiting the creasing around my laugh lines

don't be alarmed cause foundations blend beautifully on top of it
while sometimes a product will make my pores appear a bit smaller
they're usually still very visible

because of how dark my bags were
which look hooded when i'm tired because they can get so puffy
this stuff is the bees knees

as to the big glaring elephant in the room
my skin has every problem under the sun
haven't seen one of those ugly clogged up pored since
it did nothing for the darkness around my eyes as it states in the description
it only takes a few "dots" of the product to work: just put 5 drops in the palm of your h
dot it on with a finger
gently work on those other places where i have "laugh lines"
it tightens my neck too
always seemed to have tiny bumps which were very obvious in certain angles/lighting
i see the 11 lines between my brows lessened
part of red acne spots still left on both sides of face
brightening masks per week

my skin will appear a bit lackluster.
my face has a nice glow in the morning too.
my 11 lines have vanished
then i began getting itchy dry pink bumps all over my face
the fine lines are hardly visible anymore!!!
i even use it as a serum around the delicate area around my eyes
fine lines are kept to a bare minimum
it seems to plump up my face
seems to reduce the appearance of fine lines when i'm wearing it
seems to firm up my face and help even the tone.
other than some fine lines around the eyes
after patting my essence into my neck
top it off with this neck cream
i can now say that my neck looks firm
it helps repair the lines that a long day of flying exaggerates under my eyes
it goes on fairly thick
flaky around my nose
in fact not quite as thick as regular face cream
it comes in a large jar, so plenty of product.
especially the skin around my lips
sometimes my skin would swell up
the skin around my lips were starting to improve as well
the small scaly dry skin bumps on the skin were starting to disappear
this mask makes me wake up with a legit glow.
i wake up with bright
i often bite my lips when i get stressed out
this has healed any cracked or loose pieces of my lip
the only downside is that the lip brush has no resting place on or in the package
so it rests awkwardly on the lid.
hands down this is my favorite lip mask.
always peeling, and gross looking.
this lip mask is everything!!
peeling lips that have gotten much worse since i started the process of a full dental reconstruction a little lass than a year ago
1-2 times every a month my unfortunately quite small mouth is being stretched waaay beyond reason
my lips would crack
now that i don't have feeling in any of my implanted upper teeth
fix my poor lips
my lips are finally no chapped
in fact my lips just look
lips will always look bigger
i always find it that my lips are cracked or have a little skin hanging
i put it on my lips
there is still some on my lips
all the fine lines on my lips are gone
chapped at a ridiculous speed
during the day when my lips are feeling extra dried out
there's still a little bit left on your lips
i love this lip mask
moving my face over my pillow
doesn't move around on the lips
waking up to some still on the lips is perfect
lip balm wasn't enough
my lips have never been smoother and less dry.
my lips are never cracked or peeling anymore
this kept my lips soft
after 1-2 months my lips are no longer dry
my lips get severely dry during fall
are always somewhat dry all year round
this little guy has helped my lips out a lot
never really focused on lip care till now
this helped my lips overnight
my lips are softer than ever before.
flaky lips for weeks now
my lips are continuing to improve
my lips have been terribly chapped for the last 6 months
my lips were terrible!
this lip sleeping mask fixed my lips in one use!
loving this overnight mask so far
you still wake up with soft
your lips are baby smooth by morning
must have for people that suffer from chapped lips
my lips has not been this soft in a long tome
my lips are always so fry that lip balm wasnt helping anymore
my lips aren't as dried as they were.
my lips were dry out easily
i've using this lip mask for about a week
i wake up with soft lips
i've never bought a lip mask
my lips were still rather dry
in the whole realm of the world decided living with flaky lips is not the worse thing
when i wake up my lips are soft
i wake up to my lips looking so plump after wearing this over night
there was one lip balm that i've been faithful for years as my holy grails
my lips have never looked so good
wake up with some still on my lips
unlike the bite mask
i've also found that blotting my lips at this point
my lips had been acting up
the flakes were completely gone
my lips were soft again.
however, this lip mask is amazzinggg!
for years i have battled with chapped lips.
this is the best lip mask i've ever used.
i rarely use lip protection in the day time
after decades of chapped lips that nothing has helped
this mask was better than the bite lip mask.
i love this lip mask.
it's really a huge size pot for a lip mask.
after just a week of nightly use my lips are so much softer
i love this lip mask
i "pay" for it for 4-6 days afterwards with peeling rough lips
to just stop my lips from peeling for a day or sometimes two
even after one use i've noticed in the morning my lips are slightly plumper
the fine lines are gone
this lip sleeping mask did just that
i recommend both lip masks!
the next morning my lips were plump
my lips are plump
in the morning i wake up with the softest lips
this lip mask is so nice!
i wake up with my lips looking full
when i wake up my lips are so smooth
i love the ease of applying lip stick
came wth a cute little spatula in a clear sleeve
i've tried so many lip maks/
my lips have been dry
when i wake up my lips are still super soft
this product may finally end my lip issues!
i love this lip mask!
chapped lips are no longer a problem for me
i would always end up with peeling lips by midday
the next morning my lips are so smooth
my lips are not cracking
i always keep a lip balm by my bed to use at night
i wake up and it's still on my lips.
was in the habit of keeping lip balm on my nightst
i wake up with the softest lips
i even made it through a week long head cold without my lips cracking
runs outside my lip lines
removed the dead skin like this lip mask has
wow my lips the next morning were baby soft
a tiny bit at night
this lip mask is amazing.
wake up to plump healthy lips
no more biting and no more dry/flaky.

this worked great for my red cheeks
many of the times especially along the jawline
specifically on the area in the corners of my mouth/chin area far more than before
the bumps were noticeably smaller in the morning
i also notice quite a reduction in the pore size on my cheeks
my mom had noticed that more pores were smaller
this resulted in my forehead breaking out in huge painful acne bumps that were the size of a nickel
they were purple, painful and so hard to cover.
this stuff keeps those at bay
which basically looks like tiny whiteheads all over my cheeks
gnarly dry patches were significantly better
sometimes i even skip my forehead or nose as my cheeks
chin are my bigger problems
not quite a burn but a little tingling.
my pores were definitely tighter

fades marks pretty quickly
it got stained with some pink marks
i can always count on this to soothe and calm.
for having such a dry patch on my forehead
especially on my cheeks
i would get very dry in the middle of my forehead
in between my eye brows
my face tended to be over oily
i normally have dry patches around my nose
i've noticed that my forehead lines are beginning to lessen
the fine lines around my eye corners are disappearing
extremely dry patches on my cheeks appeared.
the redness on my cheeks has gone down more than ever before
stick to ole sheer transformation during the day

flakes are still there
i noticed it stings a little around my nose area where there is dry patches
i've struggled with dry skin forever
i love this i suffer from dark spots
it has toned down my skin tone to a light pinky peach instead of angry spotty red
i only have to use the tiniest bit

the dark patches are now barely visible
it also seems the dullness endured by using those terrible products is now subsiding
even my eye make up
lift me up eye cream
blemishes vanish within a day
tend to get "shiny" about halfway through the day
i also struggle with little bumps on my forehead
sometimes it would get red and itchy.
the biggest improvement i've noticed over the old formula is how easily the product glides onto the face
it seems to leave my face a little sweatier than normal
like my cheeks are both covered
only two options- the blue
dark spots after each breakout
my face is prone to them

my dark spots faded within a week
red itchy areas on my skin have subsided with the use of this product
the high points of my cheeks
my oily forehead was my biggest concern
i noticed that my pores are a lot smaller
always on the hunt for better one for my super oily skin that still manages to have chunks of skin pealing off
i even noticed that it holds back my oily forehead for longer
so the jar is lasting forever
or making it tight
the old jar had a smooth
leave the corners of my mouth
now i have a smooth forehead
feels like my skin will tear apart from tight
planned to use it on my peeling parts at night only when my shiny forehead doesnt matter
though the creme is heavy i have had zero breakouts
my jar is empty too
've been using it on my elbows
i tried a tiny bit everyday
my feet finally are soft
warm up between fingers
smooth all over face
live in a small mountain town at 7100 feet it's cold
you need the tiniest bit

maybe a tad more on the dry side
once it's warm up you dot it all over the face

it was terribly red and irritated and itchy.
apply it to my eyes
around my fine lines
my dark circles vanished
it reduced my "11's" to near invisibility.
under my eyes over fresh lotus eye cream
its a little thick for daytime
like around my mouth
now i'm trying to fight off little wrinkles
before i got this product i would have scabs on my eye lids from where i rubbed my eyes
for trouble areas like dry skin patches
i like to dab some on my lips at night as well
living in the north east the wind just drys my face
spreading it over my face
it feels like a protective barrier against the -20 degree wind chill
i only use a tiny tiny bit
i also use it around my eyes
also on my lips
my fine lines are getting deeper--
spread it across my palms
it will make them puffy
this one stings my eyes pretty badly
kind of like cream rose to the top
it is so light
is an auto lift in your skin down chin
not too thick or thin for summer nights
very different from take a deep breath
has spots of oily areas
its not all thick
about a week later i notice my pores are now completely gone on my forehead
barely noticeable on my nose
now squeezes out of two places
literally started poking at my face
has been slowly disappearing
at first i was skeptical because it did sting a tiny tiny bit
on my forehead had diminshed
even when i "scrunched" that part of my face they were noticeably less deep
i only got a little dry on my nose
works wonders when i feel a pimple coming around
staring to struggle with aging
starting to get fine lines around my eyes as well as uneven tone in some spots
some fine lines are gone and my skin is firmer.
have it skip the middle stages of being painful
now i just dollop help me on my problem spots
my pores are even beginning to become less visible
i feel like it is helping on one of my 5 large forehead wrinkles
i am concerned about the lines in my forehead
i see one or two pop up occasionally
while my lines were super duper fine
so far after 3 days pores are smaller
especially in my perioral area
tingly for a couple of days
it is mush more clear- not that i had major breakouts
the small red scarring on my chin is also lighter
old marks are fading much more quickly than normal
even at my age still prone to congestion
leaving my skin red
it cleared the bumps off my skin
can use around eyes.
tried it on a few very mild sun/age spots
on my under-eye area
lines appear slightly minimized
spots slightly less prominent
now i make myself up for me vice having to hide imperfections
a my face a tiny bit firmer
my smile lines and forehead lines were less.
nose look expecially good
dark spots started to fade a little bit
i still have spots
at day 3 i got dry patches around my mouth
it also hasn't lightened a brownish sun spot on the side of my face either
i am very happy that it's keeping my face clear of occasional pimples that have plagued me since i was in my late teens
the fine lines around my eyes
it's great for helping fade post-pimple red marks quickly
to pat them on troublesome areas
or to tap a generous amount directly on a mark or scar
there's plenty left in the tube still
this cream keeps my breakouts to a minimum without making my skin appear red
i noticed my sun spots/dark spots seemed lighter
already getting smile lines
just a bit 'fresher' in appearance
my eyes would get puffy
my main issue is dark circles though
i've had dark circles under my eyes my whole life
it got rid of that little line that creeps beneath the eyes within a few days
my dark circles look less noticeable
to brighten or depuff the eye area
i looked in the mirror
i still have yet to notice any dark circle help
not dark circles though
i work 8-9 hours a day looking in a microscope so my eyes get tired really fast
when i stop using it my eyes get puffy again
i dap a little under each eye before bed
my dark circles were nearly gone
my dark circles have come back
in the summer when the smog is more severe
dark circles were almost completely gone
don't count on it for reducing dark circles or fine lines
highly recommend for puffy eyes
no more fine lines, dark circles and puffiness.
the area around my eyes is completely rejuvenated
my skin takes a turn for the worst especially my eye area because i tend to scratch my eyes a lot which causes bags
i just wish it did a better job on my dark shadows under my eyes
it seemed didn't help with my dark circles
all you need is a little pump to pat around both eyes
i gentle pat it all along my under eye
around the outside corners
between my eyelid/eyebrow
within a week this stuff minimized my dark circles
smoothed some fine lines
toned some redness i was having around the corners
i look tired with a hint of bluish streak at my worst
dab it on with my ring finger
i think this product helped with my dark circles.
i noticed that the area around my eyes looked younger
the dark circles almost completely vanished
as well as at the corners
the dark circles are significantly lighter

i def look less tired in my eyes in the morning
it's helped firm the skin around my eyes
i notice dark circles from time to time
she recommended this one for dark circles
her dark circles were less noticeable
her eyes looked less puffy
a pale yellow skin tone so to say i have seriously dark circles is an understatement
it keeps the circles
the area under my eyes are really sensitive to eye creams
usually sting or hurt
this has helped brighten my under eye area
to help with reflecting light in the place of dark cirlces
then the dark circles started diminishing
my dark circles have faded dramatically.
maybe a bit with dark circles
it works with my puff eyes
it also reduce my dark circles
it does soothe the eye area
i don't have dark circles under my eyes
it is great for crows feet
it could do a little better on the dark circles
wanted something to correct the black circles under my eyes
i am young but, still have bags and dark circles.
it de-puffs the eye area just moments after application
however the dark circle are still there not as pronunced
deep lines under my eyes
has lightened my dark circles
my main concern was to use this product to help disperse the small fat pad under my left eye
perhaps even less bloated face
i found my fingers worked lot better than a brush
the blackheads that were once huge are so much smaller now
literally one of the best face masks i've ever used
i usually get small bumps on my face before they turn into a real pimple
i keep stroking my face
i've always had rough skin growing up
it hurt the wallet a bit to spend the $30 on the small tube
really reduces all the red that's all over my face
the price stung a bit
finally used it last night after i noticed a pimple trying to surface
in the morning my pimple was barely noticeable!
makes them less red
only on my forehead
you can feel the build up under the skin around the bump that's protruding
i've put a light layer of this on my face twice
i tried the white glamglow mask
put it on a little unevenly
annoying deep pimples that usually stay for weeks on my face are gone in two days with this stuff
my black heads have also gotten smaller.
my pores on my nose are noticeably smaller
made the mistake of trying out the glam glow clearing mask
why someone thinks that a mask that turns bright silver or blue is good for your skin is a puzzlement
this mask is a great all over mask
than other masks you have to wear for 15 mins
not really a clogged pore- i dap a little bit of this mask on it
50% of the time turn into a pimple
my face gets a little pink after
good for the occasional breakout as a spot treatment too
i also leave small spots of the mask over night on some really dark red marks on my cheeks
i've also found that the leftover marks seem to fade/heal a lot faster
give me a teeny few spots
more gentle on the face
the mask is not as thick as some other masks i’ve used
use it as a mask over any red areas
only need to squeeze a bit out
also corners of lips down chin
spread over that a little more
even the deep frown lines that went down from my mouth are almost completely gone
love how my face has a nice soft glow since i have a dry face
maybe just the tiniest bit heavy
it is getting a little chilly
especially in my chin area
now the dry spots on my skin have gone away
try the eye cream too!
especially around my eyes
is generally uneven in tone
two pumps are enough to cover my entire face.
still not irritating my eyes
i went from clumps of troubled skin to clear brighter
especially in the forehead
a half pump is plenty
so unpleasant to put on the face
so not purple or any odd color
maybe because the black one has a warming sensation to the touch
neck area with the help of a foaming net
does not sting eyes
the are around my mouth can get very dry leaving dark marks
chin clearing up some
i do not twist the pen rather i squeeze the opening to get the remnant from my first twist from the applicator
i also put a little bit of tea tree oil on my blemish along with this
this product has been my savior when i get the occasional big pimple
a red blemish or pimple pops up on your face
the sides of my face
it diminishes the size of my pimple by the next day
as soon as i start getting a big pimple
with the exception of the very deep ones
just a few irritated areas
end up with red marks that linger long after the actual zit has healed
it was reeking havoc on my self esteem.
seems to fade old ones
cleared up tiny little trouble spots on my face as well
i find my blemishes are noticeably smaller
the skin on my forehead was still reddish
had a bunch of little bumps
the bumps were gone by morning
i will refer to them as craters
it's one or two small spots
i dab a little on at night when feel a pimple brewing
by next day, pimple is virtually gone!
i used it on a pimple that was forming on my chin which is always hard to heal
so when i feel a bump under the skin
this gentle spot treatment seems to work best on deep blemishes that have not yet surfaced
it works quickly on all my blemishes except for the giant ones
i apply this to any red or bumpy areas at night
touch it to the problem spot
i generally break out on my forehead
sometimes on my cheeks near my nose
when that pimple comes out of no where
great travel size blemish shrinker.
makes it disappear a little bit quicker
break-out prone skin
when the little blemish comes to a head
leaves a tiny red spot that is gone in a day
no more volcano of hurt!
it didn't brighten my under eyes though
for preventing dark circles
i don't have any darkness or puffing under my eyes
apparently i have sensitive eyes because i've tried several eye creams
my dark circles have reduced 50%
i notice that my under eye area
my under eye area had gotten dark from long sleepy eye rubbing days at work
how continuous use fades dark circles
this is by far my favorite eye cream!
my eyes look less tired
caused the skin under my eyes to dry up
look even more tired
i saw improvement with my dark circles under my eyes
with regular use it keeps the skin around your eyes looking young
the under eye area still feels soft
i also saw a big difference in the numerous freckles around my eyes
eyes don't look puffy or tired
i can resemble a skeleton
there is no real for the intensity of my dark circles
it has helped with my dark circles slightly
it keeps my under eye area looking even
all around great eye cream
sometimes eye creams cause me to get little clear bumps all around my eyes
did diminish the dark circle quite a bit

for my dry eyes
is working very well to prevent sore
it is so light
although my dark cicles are still there.
my eye area feels so smooth and tighter.
my fine lines look a lot finer then they wete before i started using this eye cream
my previous eye cream was heavy
i swear my wrinkles were a little less visible :
how it spread so nicely around my eye area
it's just keep my eyes look rested
the puffs under my eyes
slight darkness are not helping
puffs gone darkness gone.
i couldn't spend triple digits on face/eye cream
the fine lines vanish
it is a little on the heavy side
i don't see any puffiness or dark circles disappearing
especially on such a delicate part of the face
i like this for the way it smoothed the fine lines around my eyes
it hasn't done anything for my dark circles
pray for brightening of my raccoon eyes
as someone with under eye bags
i don't have darkness under my eyes
i guess it's on the cheaper side compared to other under eye creams
dark shadows when i'm sleep deprived
a lot of eye products in the past have irritated my eyes
no problem if a bit gets in my very-sensitive eyes
while my under eye circles are definitely not gone
seems to make the dark circles appear lighter too
i don't really see a reduction in dark circles
mine are more thin skin than being tired
somewhat with eye bags
keep going back to it because it keeps the skin around my eyes soft
my dark circles as well as puffy eyes disappear
fades my under eye circles-a little goes a long way

i've always had dark circles
it was very gentle around my eyes

my pores have become noticeably smaller too!
sometimes i have just a little bit of black under my eye from mascara
the other flares up
any little mark shows up bright
as a red head with oily
ihave used this on my eyes
those areas get tight when washed
i work in a pretty dusty/dirty outdoor location
making my face red
flaky with tiny little "baby bumps" on my cheek
the red blotches have started to dissapear after a couple of uses
this face wash is good for the sensitive parts of my face: the part of my cheeks right by mouth
as for my nose
noticed that my sensitive cheeks flaired up
so naturally sections of my face are red
and my chin/forehead are shiny.
thought i needed new make-up to cover up the red splotches
my face is no longer red
easily irritated face my whole life

i've tried a countless number of products from olay to arcona to anastasia beverly hills
the ones nearby moving toward my cheeks have always been large

smooth rather than red
a skin issue around my nose that is so easily irritated
i wore blush the other day.

the bar tends to break
started to break out into welts

not inflamed or irritated as it used to be

causing these skin colored bumps all over my forehead
rub them along the bar
any new blemishes that pop up are visibly smaller or dried up completely the morning after i use it
the bar never gets smaller
rubbing the bar directly on my face

my fine lines are diminishing
the nude face oil is very nice
i bit the bullet
i rub it all over my face
no stress lines from sleeping
rather than a cotton ball
the reason i'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is because it stung my eyes terribly
didn't sting my skin
stings my eyes really bad.
rub on my face
for those reviews that said it burns the eyes
not at all irritated
looks red at times
one pump spreads over the face and neck well.
do not have one wrinkle or crow's foot
seems to even out the red/sallowness of my fair skin as well for a more even complexion
one pump is plenty to cover the entire face

s my face itched
usually i have to mix a couple of drops of rose water to thin it out a bit

i am now eyeing the eye cream by them as well!
no irritation to my eye area either.
i've noticed my under eyes are so smooth now
probably from years of yanking on my lower eyelid to put my contacts in
it doesn't irritate my eyes
you only need a tiny bit
my eyes are the one spot starting to show my age
this stuff helps my dark circles
i've noticed them going down in dark circles
as long as you dot a tiny bit you're set
since the jar is tiny

all the up toward my temples
my eyes look good in the morning
i do the same thing with the shiseido white lucent eye cream during the day
dryness starting to show under my eyes as well as crows feet
this eye cream is a very thick
i just apply some eye shadow primer on my lid
it has also helped very much with my dark circles
i could see a big improvement with this eye cream right off the bat- dark circles finally lightened
the fine lines softened
i got fed up with them flaking despite wearing eye cream
most younger women find it too thick
when the skin around the eye is dry that will creates crow feet
i've tried literally hundreds of other eye creams through the years -- i'm one of the first sephora rouge members

i still have darkness underneath the eyes
dryness under the eyes that i don't want perpetuated into fine lines
decreases the crepey look under eyes
the fine lines at the corner of my eyes have disappeared
the dark circles that had started to form under my eyes have diminished as well
i always had fine lines really pronounces dark circles
i tried so many eye cream
my fine lines are reduced

you only need a fingertip patted around each eye.
a bit thick so for daytime use- an even tinier bit brightens

on a stubborn crease on my forehead
this stuff will plump those lines up in front of your eyes

after pictures of my eyes
my lines are diminishing
everything i tried irritated my under eye area
crinkly crepey skin under my eyes in just a couple of weeks
the area around my eye is vry dry.
my eye area looks almost blurred!
looked into a bunch of different eye creams
it's like a tall drink of water for my eyes
they are barely damp
i've noticed a pretty big difference in my under eye fine lines/wrinkles
firmness around my eye plus the reduction in fine lines is worth the greasy-ness
i often get little red bumps around my eyes when i use a make up remover
no more little red bumps or oily mess when i wake up
were rough on my skin
they're large when unfolded
while they were softer
the clothe itself can be a little rough on the delicate skin around eyes
i just wish the sheets were a bit softer
3 to 4 swipes on the face
incredibly lax about washing her face
gentle enough to use even around the eyes
yet really get all the grim
the little bit of remaining stubborn texture i had on my cheeks
forehead is now completely gone
oily in some areas
i tend to get shiny in the forehead mid-day
flaky areas in the winter
my only bone to pick is that the cap is a bit wonky
doesnt sit in the groove very tightly
it is one of those alternating oval designs.
i still have to blot
huge shine in my t-zone
the pump barely works
keeps my face clear fom blemishes
my cheeks are often alittle bit rough
another pump for the skin around my eyes
i tend to get very dry patches around my nose/eyes/etc during certain seasons
since i only wear primer once in a blue moon for special events
smooth out my face a little
forehead are shiny just two hours after i wash my face
my cheeks are normal
my skin is prone to break-outs
just a little dab goes a long way~~
i always have a jar on hand.
i've just started graying so that adds to it

no more dry patches after this
there's just a hint left on the surface of the skin
quite a few fine lines
after a year the deeper lines on my forehead softened
under eyes as well
feels a little heavy in the summer
prior to using it i had these faint forehead
have been dabbing just a little of this under my eyes
on that little frown line between my brows before bed
it makes the lines look like they vanished instantly
for having such a thick consistency
no break outs, no black heads.
i think it even has staved off wrinkles
this facial cream has helped diminish the appearance of fine lines under my eyes
too heavy as a day cream
helps with fine lines around the eyes
i wake up with a plump, glowing face.
no red, dry patches, no flakes anymore!
i am always a little nervous trying a new face cream
in other dry areas
the skin near my nose
no break-outs or watery eyes when applying
it has faded spots
got an itchy rash on the back of my h
generally i use it under my eyes
it looks heavy in the jar
especially on the edges of my eyes

i actually bought it for my mom who complained about having uneven skin color on her face
i recommend this for dark spots
my face is less dull
sun damage spots that i have
i just dip my finger tip in and that's enough.
i first got the eye cream in a jar
i am now wearing only clinique's newer powder foundation
i noticed that my face was startin' to become blotchy
wanted to use it to lighten some darker patches of skin on my face
i used the white lucent line for about two years.
neck- i applied mostly to my face only
i am noticing that my dark spots from sun damage have begun to fade
i noticed i was a bit dry in some places
caused my face to turn red
nothing has made my sun spots vanish like this has
bright my face will become with continued use
it's best to use the entire white lucent line together
there are no beads
i seriously love this face wash/entire white lucent line
and a tiny tiny bit goes such a long way!
i used some too because i needed some brightening to my dull face
almost scaly on the sides of my face
you'll see it slowly
it goes great with the other products in the white lucent line
i notice the brightening effect right away after washing my face
has lightened up my dark spots.
and i have plenty of sun-spots.
it never lightened one dark spot
entire white lucent line was removed from my routine
as far as the brightening goes
the dark spot afterwards goes away much faster
loved the way it lightened my brown spots!
other than my eye make-up
it goes on super white
within the past 9mth have had sun spots develop on my forehead
under one of my eyes
really hides my age spots
i love the fact that it has slowly minimized the redness around the mouth area
she noticed that her brown spots from sun damage look much lighter
others said it was too thick
which may be from the white powder
a very tiny dab will do just fine
even though it is thick
i also use it on my neck to keep it soft
to get rid of brown spots
spots are still visible
since the cream was a bit thick
my face really got whitened
beware- it is a very thick cream
have noticed mild brightening to my eye area
most eye creams make the corner of my eyes turn red
this eye cream is different.
as a someone who struggles with chronic dark circles
under eye puffiness seems to vanish within 10 to 15 minutes
don't see any new lines or my dark circles aren't getting darker
dark circles to begin with
that my overall eye area was looking a bit dull
before using this product i was getting noticeable dark circles under my eyes from being tired

this is the best product for dark circles.
including the eye balm from skinceuticals
i've noticed a decrease of the dark circles under my eyes
i love this eye cream mostly for overnight use
i dont have super dark circles under my eyes
been on the hunt for an under eye cream that could drastically lighten my dark circles

i tried a lot of eye products
my under eyes were exptremely dry before
hide my fine lines
but it doesn't help with my dark circles at all!
my dark circles are also diminished.

my skin roundly eyes look great
the best eye cream if you have sensitive eyes!
there are some pricey ones that lett me feeling groggy

her dark circles has diminished a lot
her eyes looks more wide awake

doesn't really brighten the area or help with the darkness
it doesn't seem to help my dark circles much

it seems fine for crow's feet.
i noticed the other day to my horror that my under eye area was looking very dry
my under eye area is no longer dry
i didn't think it was possible for my under eye area not to have puffiness when i smiled
after only a couple days of use i immediately notice a difference in the dark circles around my eyes
i've never used an eye cream before.
the dark circle were lighter
hands down the best eye cream.
i used a whole jar of all about eyes
i know my dark circles aren't heritagity i was really skeptical about about eye cremes
desperate for help with my under eye circles
my eyes look brighter than my pre-all about eyes rich days
not long after a found that the dark circles under my eye became more noticeable again
i've found my must have eye cream
with the weather lately
softening lines around the eyes
i did not notice any help with shadows/ dark circles
i've often said that "an eye cream is just an eye cream"
found that it did minimize the look of my dark circles
with less defined wrinkles you would get from smiling a lot

my bags under my eyes were huge
crows feet are gone.

this winter has been brutal on my skin--i'm using argan oil under thick face cream multiple times a day to stay ahead
ended up with patches of dry
my spots from old acnes fading away
with a tendency to get congested very easily
you guessed it red hair
irritated during the harsh winters of the northeast
i noticed the bumps began to disappear
everything i've tried breaks my skin out with little red bumps on my forehead or reddish blotches on my face
not one pimple, red spot or dry patch!

even after washing my face at the end of the day the dark circles still seems much lighter than before using this
i doubt it because those pesky circles are usually st

the area around my eyes is brighter
less puffy than ever before
4 stars only because the pump sticks
it has even helped to stimulate my eye lash grow

i'd describe it more as crumbling off than 'peeling'
i find it uncomfortable to rub this mask off the face

the usual stubborn small bumps along the side of my face has either went away or there's less of them there now compared to before using this product
the spots are clearing up

in between my brows
it was lightening dark spots
have only had the occasional blemish on my forehead or chin
i no longer have those little bumps everywhere
they were mostly on my cheeks
my skin is almost perfect with just the occasional bump or two
meaning it's all centered on my chin
so mostly i just have a chin full of little red spots
many fewer clogged pores elsewhere on my face
which has occurred mostly all on my chin
sometimes on my cheeks
the occasional minor break out
let sit until the mild tingling subsides
all throughout college i suffered with small tiny closed comedones all across my cheeks
my face was so bumpy too.
though it can sting a little
white heads were gone
even the skin below the surface started to smooth out
becoming increasingly frustrated with my breakout-out skin

my scars are slowly going away as well
my breakouts are more spaced out
the bottle is quite stiff
i struggle with lots of scars
general texture/bump issues

dark spots along with frequent breakouts
like stray beads that get everywhere
maybe twice a week on my cheeks

my chin due to lack of sun
somewhat dry once you've patted your face
recently my skin was going through a pimply phase
dry skin in different seasons
i get really stubborn breakouts all around my chin

some fine lines look a little better
it is helping with my deep wrinkles on my forhead

it clears up any little spots or issues i have on my face
was red in certain areas
it wasn't crystal clear as usual
sun spots/red spots fading too!
i no longer get breakouts along my forehead like i used to
by august my skin was free of white heads
just all around unruly skin
so the occasional spot does rear its ugly beginnings
i only get the occasional white head

isolated to one part of my face
mostly many small ones
still struggling with the occasional breakout

i pat it on the spot (never rub).
a tiny dap on the pimple right when it appears
just very thin layers over my problem spots
i put this on this giant pimple i had.

the bigger blemishes take 1-2 days
this is my go-to for when an unexpected "face demon" dampers my day
the tube is quite small
by morning they're flat red spots
only on active spots not on my entire face
i just dab on a very small amount on the affected area at night
my chin is a major problem area
around the front of my ears
white heads around my nose
some between my eyebrow
then, of course, i got a huge pimple on my chin.
still have plenty left
i noticed the dark circles are diminishing
this is especially great on those pimples that start down real deep
you see a red bump
it never turns into a full-blown zit
just a small dot on the problem spot
days of having a big ugly pimple while you wait for it to heal
makes the blemishes disappear a lot faster
i dot this on my trouble spots
within 1 day my pimple is noticeably smaller
just a dab when the blemish appears

i still have a few visible scars
except for a few 2-3 tiny scars left my skin is smooth
it also helps any bumpy blemishes i have go flat overnight
the spots are noticeably fading.
specifically with a bit of a nasty area on my cheek
my scars aren't completely gone
within a minute the rough texture had softened

i've noticed a lightening of the darker spots
some big red spots on my cheeks

still working a couple large spots
they are slowly diminishing
i still got some pesky break outs that were cyst-like

in two weeks my spots are barely recognizable!
i woke up with less irritated skin
my dark spots are significantly lighter

even my darkest spots acnes left me are gone
lightening of scars or dark spots
the scars were particularly bad on my left cheek
a few on the right cheek
most of the new scars were fading
by february i noticed that the scars were still fading
my entire left cheek is now scar free
usually it takes months for my dark spots to fade
really works at getting rid of those dark spots.
i don't see all the dark spots
little red marks every where
i still have the dark spots left over from before
it not only dramatically cuts down the fade time for the dark spots
i still had ugly dark spots left over
my scars visibly lightened
my scars are very red at first.
they leave long lasting red

scrapes from stubble wreck my chin

fingers crossed for improvement of dark circles soon
mostly from lack of sleep

then i used the instant depuffing eye mask with it
so my eyes look baggy
the puffiness under my eyes goes away fast

although it disappears right way
its too soon to see if its lightening my dark circles
my fine eye wrinkles literally almost disappeared overnight

there are still scars
just a few on my cheek/nose area

i only use it on my t-zone which is really the only spot on my face with visible pores
they are no longer big holes on my cheeks
my pores were so large in some places i was embarrassed
especially on my cheeks
nose seems to be working better than the cheek
even these depressions became smaller
i've noticed that the pores on my nose have gotten larger
since it's just my nose where i have enlarged pores the sample will last me for awhile
and my t-zone has pretty serious pore problems.
my face looks soo different my pores are so much smaller
especially on my cheeks
my largest pore problem area is my nose
i only really have been using it on my cheeks
as i age my pores were getting larger
two weeks later the area from my cheek bone down to my jawline look years younger
more supple than it has been in awhile
my pores are still slightly visible
my pores were visably smaller in a matter of days
my pores are now only slightly visible
the area under my bottom lip

my forhead and eye area are looking better.
especially in the 2 inches or so on the sides of my nose
fine laugh lines around my eyes are softened
i really see a difference in my forehead lines
this last winter i started getting red patches on my face
above my upper lip
dark spots get lighter
prone to breakouts even though i am in my mid 50's
it tightens lines around my mouth
the "11 lines" are disappearing
the area that i am so shocked by is the area above my eyebrows
where i have deep "expression"
something deeper beneath the skin
as well as the creases in between my eyebrows

not to mention my baby smooth forehead
the creases i have my my eyes
"marionette-lines" have started to smooth out already
after using this product i still didn't have dark circles
no more dry patches
along with some fine lines
however, my cheeks, nose, and eye area were fine.
my cheeks look like they're glowing from within.

i think it keeps my skin from getting deeper lines
use the serum on my neck which is a big help
neck to keep my skin firm
with a lot of lines on forehead

my only disappointment is that the deeper wrinkles around my mouth
often skip eye cream
would fall in my creases
my dark circles are gone
this balm keeps my eye area firm
including my eye lids because those get dry
also a little on lips works wonders.
the wrinkles on the corner of my eyes are gone
the darkness has lightened
i struggle with dark circles
of course the eye area is the first to show aging
this balm completely erased my dark circles
somehow made my eye area even smoother
my under eye area can look
'cos i was already using an eye cream
didn't see any effect on dark circles
reduced my dark circles
has helped soften those pesky little creases under my eyes to where my concealer would creep in

there was a bit of sticker shock
my eyes are firm, brighter, and no more circles.

i'd like to think my dark circles aren't as noticeable in the morning
also on top of my nose bone
in between my eyes

too much sun chasing
i'd never used an eye cream before
rub my eyes occasionally during the day
noticed after the first couple uses the skin around my eyes were not as dry
my dark circles are less pronounced
my eyes look fresh, and well rested.
my dark circles are much lighter
i tried many different eye cream
on top of that i have major dark circles really purple
nearly 40 i have dark circles
suffer from dark circles
i applied it to my under eye
my dark circles were almost non existent
i don't really suffer from lines or dark circles
my eyes look more awake, less dark circles.
my eyes were burning once i started sweating
it's already helping the darkness under my eyes
this eye balm is up there with the best i've tried

even around the eye area
couple with this i've got pretty bad dark circles
have always had dark undereye circles
it takes a surprisingly small amount to take care of both eyes
my dark circles had vanished & i was in awe.!!..
this eye cream is by far one of my absolute favorites
while their are a lot of good eye creams out their
dark circles are genetic so no eye cream is going to completely solve that problem
those will help deflect light
make dark circles less visible
that makes the area around my eyes even more sensitive
any other eye creme i used was too thin
thick without feeling like a thick balm is sitting on your eyes
particularly around my eyes
even better than clinique all about eyes rich
i do not have dark circles
definitely notice the skin around my eyes is tighter
i notice a lot of reviews about white residue.
you need the tiniest bit!
my lines are gone
my eyes look years younger
i usually put this product on the forehead lines as well as the under eye area
i pat it around lightly
it makes my fine forehead line disappear
not the deeper line
obvious under-eye bags are my only issue.
had some dark spots under my eyes
i don't just have bags under my eyes
quick upward strokes on my crows feet
made no facial expressions for 5 minutes
there was just the tiniest spot of white under one eye
has lines on his eyes from working in the sun
being 56 years old is taking a toll on the skin under your eye
mine were really puffy
i've tried almost every eye cream on the market
on the lines on my forehead
very bad under eye bags
up into the temple area--leaving very little white residue
i've had large bags under my eyes my entire life
looked at my face in the mirror under my eyes
no more sunken in eyes
but boy, when it's on right...zero wrinkles.
don't smile or make expressions for 10 minutes
i put it on with a brush over the puffy areas
i look much more rested.
feel like it really tightens the under eye area
i've had puffy eyes my whole life
fine lines around the eye
dry skin with those big puffy bags that make my face look 10 years older
they decrease my puffy bags but only slightly.
instantly tightens the area around the eye without surgery
no puffy bags or wrinkles under your eyes ladies
with the tip of your finger put a little bit of product under your eye
not too close to your eye
use it mainly on your puffy parts
have fine lines under my eyes
wrinkles in the area at the upper end of my nose
where are the wrinkles between my eyes?
work it in small circles
onto my ring finger
the only problem for me is that i still have a slight darkness under the eyes
just smoothing the skin takes away much of the shadowing below the eyes
avoid the area right under my eyes
use the other side of the eyeshawdow brush to do the remaining eye
then i try not to make facial expressions
it will hide the bags under your eyes
there is an intense white film left on your eye
simply pat the very tiniest amount onto your under eye puff
sometimes i see a little white flakiness
i just lightly swipe with a dampened cotton swag
it firms up the skin under your eyes - instantly.
firm up the eye area where applied
now i also have wrinkles in the under eye area
1 part of my regular eye cream mixed together
there are seldom white areas
under just a light touch of foundation
really does tighten lines and creases!
it smoothed the wrinkles right off her eyes
it's really just shadows from the bags
(that was a hard pill to swallow!)
she whips out this mirror
sticks it in my face
about putting it on lightly to avoid white
you only need a teeny tiny bit
the beginning stages of crows feet
not only on the eye area even though it is for the eyes
the deep furrow was less defined and relaxed.
forhead lines gone and crows feet smoothed.
the area under my eyes!
i don't use this everyday just when my eyes are puffy
this is the third product of its kind that i've used to smooth out lines around the eyes
saw the lines smooth out under my eyes
a teeny tiny bit goes a long way
i always shake the tube well
you use just a tiny bit all around the eye
watch the sagging areas under the eye firm up
it tightens under the eye
partly from pulling my eyelid down to insert contact lenses for 20 years
had gotten puffy under my eyes from all the congestion
it absolutely destroyed any sign of puffiness underneath my eyes
who has crows feet
he applied under clean eye area.
is not only for people with puffy eyes
it turns white on your face
i love putting this under my eyes as it tightens up all my fine lines
just pat a little under the eye on top of your make up
i keep one of these tubes everywhere!
i am plagued with large pores on my nose
this stuff masks that problem.
the lighter ones seem to almost highlight the pores
rub in a circular direction in small sections
as i'm aging i'm noticing larger pores on the sides of my nose
still gets a shiny even with it
when i start getting a little shiny
come crawling back to clinique
fine lines almost invisible
you only need a tiny bit
the fine lines on my forehead
the product you use when you go to patch up some holes in the wall
the pores on my nose have always been an issue
still use the "deep" tint
i couldn't believe how quickly my pores shrunk with one swipe of my finger
i usually squeeze out a little bit on my h
it hides those holes very well
it really gives a nice cover across your whole face or just along the areas were your pores are most visible
by applying a small dot for each line with my fingertips
small irregularities all over the face
this seems a little thick coming out of the tube
to fill in a wrinkle that crosses the bridge of my nose
it only takes a tiny amount to cover my problem areas
i put it on my cheeks
waiting for the smaller size of the hourglass mineral veil oil free to come back into stock
i've tried several different pore minimizers
i seriously don't even feel like i have to wear foundation when i use this on my nose a near-nose cheek area
was going to buy the invisible bright version
no extra sheen today
have only tried the invisible though
how it can help to hide my forehead crease
it also keeps me from looking as shiny throughout the day
i often use it on my nose
it is totally invisible
doesn't seem to do much for my cheeks or forehead
all of the little bumps on my cheeks
forehead are slowly going away
thick this particular one is
one pump on each cheek
one on my forehead
one split between my nose
especially with my clarisonic brush
it also has softened all my facial lines.
so avoid the mouth area
i mean permanent on my face all the time big red patches
this cleansing oil has calmed it all down to a light pink
if it gets in your lips/mouth it is weirdly bitter
then spread it across my damp face
most noticeably on my nose
raccoon eyes as you're rubbing it around
a decreased in the appearance of fine lines around the eyes
don't get in your eyes or it will make your vision quite blurry
dragging the skin a bit
wearing spf or sweating a lot
eye make-up last to be massaged
because my skin hated the loccitane oil omfg those were some dark days
i dampen my face
the oily parts of my skin have calmed down a bit
i came into sephora with dry patches on my skin red dots
patches along with unevenness
just all-around ugly face
all my eye make up
i didn't get that foggy filmy feeling in my eyes
my face still became more oily than usual
when i put it on my eyelids even throughout the day my eyes felt weighed down
cheeks have evened out
thick enough for the night
even a few dry patches
all my dry patches are gone and my face was fine.
for years now i've had issues with flaking around my nose
the flakes where gone
getting a few dastardly lines
although it felt a bit thick
if i use it around my eyes
i am a very fair red-head
this is a beyond perfect face/hand/body cream.
you only need the tiniest bit
even when trying other lines my skin turned scaly again
mostly around my eyes
have barely dented the surface of the product
as well as congested
it is a bit heavy
after trying out benefit's "it's potent" eye cream
it's great for dry spots like around my nose
in between my eyebrows
the dry patches are gone
get very dry around my nose
a little too thick for the day
red skin around my nose / mouth
a small leaf blowing in the wind stuck right to my face
dry in some areas
especially around my chin
the dark circles, however, are not reduced.
i finally started to see a difference with my dark circles
because i could feel little tingling around my eyes
ive always had large dark under eye circles from being an insomniac most my life
the purple under my eyes has completely gone away
now it's just gradually going back to the color of my skin
unlike the bareminerals eye cream
i've gone through eye cream after eye cream hoping for some help for my dark circles under my eyes
after putting a few dots on my under eyes it really does brighten
eye hollows since i was young
the tone of my under eyes now matches the tone of the rest of my face
will note that that the under eye hollows still exist which can cast shadows
if you need to lighten dark circles this is a holy grail find
i looked like a sad clown with dark brown tears.
this product has completely removed those dark spots
very little crowds feet
i looked less tired
i forgot how dark my circles were
started using a different eye cream
behold my dark circles creeped back

depuffed my under eye area looks when using this cream
i suddenly noticed my skin getting lighter
my least favourite: dark under eye circles.
my under eye circles are almost non existent.
had to have a full-size as it brings a refresh to my eye area with such visible results to dull my mild dark circles
the area under my eyes brightened
my eyes are so much more bright and awake now.
it has a plumping effect that works great under the eyes where with age we tend to get dark circles
i apply this eye cream right in the area of the crease below eyes where the "circles" are evident

this eye cream comes in a small pump dispenser which has a indicator on the side to show how much of the eye cream is left in the bottle

as far as dark circles go
a little on the expensive side
dark circles under my eyes
as far as brightening my dark circles
the decision was almost a tie between shiseido's white lucent eye cream

when i was using shiseido's white lucent eye cream
after suffering from increasingly dark circles
in the divots of the bridge of my nose for the past 8 years
my undereyes look as though they have flat semi-circles with darkness around the edges
trying endless products for my dark circles

genetic dark circles on my very fair skin
dark circles under my eyes
i put it on right before bed then in the morning my small to medium undereye circles were noticably smaller

no tingling after i put it on
a bit lighter then expected
i can see an immediate difference in the superfine lines at the edges of my eyes when i apply it

the eye cream gives visible results of lightening after a few uses
puffiness on the eye area is pretty bad especially because i stay up late all the time
#discoverorigins #sephora #voxbox #free #sample #test its a perfect cream to cover the fines expressions lines either the horribles black circles than appears at the mornings

it brightens up my under eye area where i always have dark circles
the cream is thick enough to cover the under eye area

my dark circles are fading every time i use it
my eyes are not puffy at all

just a little tingly near the eyes
then again i don't really suffer from dark circles
because of the pinkish color it does brighten up the under eye area which is great whether worn alone or under makeup
darkness under my eyes
i get really bad dark circles
however this product i could literally see working as i dabbed it on
if i tilt my head to the side i can see it glisten
within minutes you can see the puffiness going down
i also use it on my eyelids
i don't have lines or dark circles or even noticeable puffiness ever
the glow from it was enough to peek through foundation
i love that it's almost shimmer when i apply it on my under eyes
it's one thing for this to help the dark circles under my eye
not to mention it looks glittery on your eyes
i work night shift so puffy
tired eyes are a daily struggle
it completely erases my dark circles
in the morning especially after i wake up my eyes are really puffy
hides my dark circles
it's light reflexive properties are just the tip of the iceberg
i struggle with dark circlies
i experience dark circles
it keeps my tired eyes looking bright
my eyes haven't been as dry.
i tend to have dark circles
but this one is literally a waking up eyes cream.
more awaked than my regular eyes cream
sleeping very little lately
bright despite the near-constant zombie mode i have been in
i don't think that it battles super strong dark circles
even if ive had a late night rhis eye cream makes my under eyes bright
one small dot under the eye can help cover the entire undereye
i don't usually have bags under my eyes.
doesnt crease as bad as it used to under my eyes
for my dark circles it did nothing as mine are genetics
depuffs under eye circles and brightens eyes.
it works very well for the dark circles reducing the dullness around your eyes
my favorite eye cream immediately improves the dark circles under my eyes
i also apply it to my upper eyelids to help with any puffing

more trouble towards the oily side
i struggle a lot less with oil and breakouts.
down my chin near the edges of my mouth for so long
my under eyes turn super puffy
still have plenty left
i only use tiny little bit every time.
the last few months i started getting this little dry patches on my cheeks
has been taking its toll on my cheeks/nose/even forehead
a tiny bit on my cheeks
the lower part of my cheeks
lip area very dry
it seems to burn my eyes a lot
if i do get a pimple lately there very small
i also use the 10 mins trouble mask from origins as well
it pairs perfectly with my clarisonic.
because i was smearing it over blemishes instead of dabbing/dotting them
since i've been dotting it on top of blemishes it's become incredibly effective
the moment i feel a pimple forming i put this on
even for the deep
i dab on a small amount on any visible or palpable blemish in the morning
leaves a film over the spot
my pimple was literally gone overnight
it is a tiny bottle but you only need a tiny bit.
like it's a stinging sensation at the same time as a burning one
i put it on a pimple i could feel forming last night
the next morning the bumps are dried up.
stings a little at first
the bottle is literally the size of my thumb though
my tougher acne spots took 2 days to clear up.
i also found that it gets rid of dark marks left from in-growns as well
it does sting a bit
it does help dry up the pimple at a faster pace
it also sometimes burns on the blemish spot.
it will sting a tiny bit
my dark spots are not as dark
some have faded away
every single pimple is almost completely gone
you literally only need to put a tiny dot directly on your problem spots
helped current dark spots fade
very tiny for $16 though.
it has a bit of a biting sensation if applied to an open blemish
i sparely put small dots where needed
it really works clearing my dark spots
even this huge pimple i had on the tip of my nose i applied a layer once for three
this stuff alone with another thing have almost completely made my scars vanish
i can go bare faced with no problem.
using this has cut down on that bad habit significantly due to the bigger pimples drying out faster
wake up with skin visibly calmer where it was previously highly irritated
and the zits shrunk down within a day or two!
i've watched imperfections disappear overnight
is covered with just a little foundation
to cluster in obvious areas
the rest are diminishing
it helps speed up clearing blemishes that are 1-2 days in
but it stings quite a bit at first though.
the spot seems a lot less irritated
it tingles a little on contact
because it will sting
i dab a tiny bit on my spots
now i use it just for the odd pimple that pops up
it goes on clear and cool and invisible.
whenever i have little bumps or pimples i just dap a little of this on them after my night routine
i can honestly say that it has helped smoothed those tragic forehead lines that seemed to have crept in
were more noticeable on the left side of my forehead
my fine lines also looked softer
i come from a family where the women as they age become marionette mouths
a little dab in the jar with my finger goes a long way- all over my face
minimization of my fine lines around my eyes
as well as my chin
no dullness at all
i really like the starting over eye cream
was left with a slight oily face
my fine lines around my eyes
my deep expression lines on my forehead have also gotten better
along with the starting over eye cream
i love the ease in which this spreads evenly on my face
around my nose were very noticeable
on the flip side it makes my eyeliner slide
just avoid my eyes
they visibly smoothed out
it would shield skin well from harsh weather
this has smoothed out some dry skin bumps by my nose
use it around my eyes
i also use it on my neck
when my face gets really red
my problems lie mainly on the apples of my cheeks
it spreads very easily without tugging the skin
plus some ginzing eye cream
i actually got a dry patch above my lip
in my quest to battle aging to the bitter end i have tried a myriad of creams
is thick without being too heavy
i swear there was a glow.
i wake up glowing!
even though i'm prone to the occasional breakout
stubborn little bumps that had been plaguing my forehead
cheeks all winter had massively diminished
banished the gross uneven texture i'd been dealing with
i do feel it diminishes some of the fine lines under my eyes
about the size of pinky nail or a tiny bit bigger will cover your face
some background: it's cold as balls outside
the visibly dry skin around the edges of my nose are completely gone
i find i'm redder or darker in some areas of my cheeks
i also did notice it helped with some small fine lines on my forehead
scars are looking better it's only for night time
i can't stop at my face go to shoulders chest basically belly up
i woke up everyday with my skin glowing
dry skin especially around the corners of my eyes
can leave some slight shine on your face
rainbows all wrapped in a big red bow with a cherry on top
it is so thick
my face is peeling like crazy
the next morning most of my tiny white bumps were vanished helping with the texture of my skin
i struggled with tiny little breakouts
instead get small white bumps on my cheeks
the bumps turn red
i always wake up with plump
have some semi-deep wrinkles on my forehead
finer lines around my mouth
shine all day on my forehead
it does irritate or "sting" my eyes a bit
although on the dry side
it helps in subsiding them
hard bumps under my skin on my forehead
those hard bumps filled with white grossness start brewing under my skin again
put a bit on your fingers
creamy great to use with my face brush to later up slightly a little goes a long way
then apply in small circular motions across my entire face
my fine wrinkles are disappearing.
my cheeks aren't red anymore
it tingles a little bit when you put it on
left a little bit of blemishes
i do get breakouts on occasion especially around my nose
make them less inflamed
this mask works like a charm to clear up my problem areas
this has become my favorite face mask.
the blemishes on my face got smaller and lighter.
in ten minutes my pores go from gaping to barely visible
i really rely on it when i get a deep cystic breakout
've tried hordes of skin products
it didn't lighten dark spots
about 3/4 of my face i still cover
night time origins masks
this mask is intense.
since the dirt has already been drawn out of the pore
unlike other mud masks that are too thick
i've noticed my pores do look a bit smaller
i like to lay it on really thick
just watch all the white
black heads slowly start to come out as the mask dries on my faces
when i take it off my nose is noticeably smoother even after one use
i also had a pimple that disappeared quickly after using the mask
i find after a long work week this mask is great for shrinking the size of my pores
clears my face of black heads
my eyelids are firm, smooth and lifted.
whenever i look in the mirror
my pores look bigger than usual
this mask glided on so nicely
love this face mask!
oil that settles in on/around my nose as well as my chin
literally right after washing it off my red acne turns into a white head
this mask has been a holy grail for my face
clinique's all about eyes are two of my favorites
i look much more awake
my under eye area is still very soft
i can't say much about it diminishing dark circles
the wrinkles around my eyes have been so bad
the darkness around my eyes have lightened up as well
very dry under eyes
although i am unsure if it has helped with any dark circles it is keeping my eye area moisturizer
i also had dark circles
the dark circles are practically gone

my under eye area is always so dry.
i horrible dry under eyes
my eyes are actually healing
i still had dry patches around the under area
i can't vouch for this fixing the crow's feet or dark circles
both of them caused small bumps on my eyelids
i don't think it has made my puffy under eye areas any less puffy
a little speck of product is all you need
around my eye sockets to prevent crows feet
i've noticed the corners of my eyes have less crows feet since using this
i get a very teary eye in the wind
with the colder weather my own tears have been burning the skin around my eyes
this makes my under eye area
the fine lines under my eyes
this is a great cream for the skin around the eyes
this eye cream is by far my favorite.
as for the fine lines i have under my eyes
i wanted a light weight eye cream that isn't on the pricey side
i wanted a new under eye cream
dabbed a bit of this under my eyes
it never became chalky
i bring it all the way around my eyebrows

even the small wrinkles below my eyes were less noticeable
dry patches around my eye area during the winter time
the girl at the store suggested this when i complained that my eyelids were very itchy
favourite eye cream i've tried so far.

the little bumps around my nose went away
my black heads seemed just a little smaller
the cap nipple has broken off on several occasions
around mouth area being most sensitive
my face has less oil
i show most of my oil on my forehead
i've noticed with origins that a little goes along way
i've even accidentally rubbed it on my eyes
for years i have struggled with very oily skin
my dry patches are gone
i figure since my pores were open
i rub it all over my face
only use this product on the dry areas of my face which are my cheeks
although my nose is a little red afterwards
my cheeks were so dry
rub it in all over
the bumps that like to hang around my jawline have diminished or are completely gone
the mask is very light
it is slightly too intense for me to use as an all-over face mask
especially on my cheeks
this mask gets down deep
i like how light the mask is
as a mask after i've been in the sun ☀
was experiencing some red patches
i will use it on trouble spots
the fine lines around my eyes are gone
i like something on the lighter side
my skin keeps clear throughout a full day.
my scars have cleared up a fair
the "oiliness" of my face has gone down so much in just 2 weeks
at the expense of having to touch up with powder to get rid of the inevitable 3 pm "i'm glowing
t starts to get a little shiny after that
along the jaw line i ten to be dry
smooth without settling into bumps
made it appear less red
it also helped with those painful under the skin bumps from popping up
every time my skin is pitching a fit this just nips it in the bud
am cautious about masks
deep pimple that had been sitting on my forehead for over a week
my blemishes are noticeably smaller in the morning
works on shoulders & back too.
the next day the breakouts are noticeably smaller
my forehead, nose, and chin are my problem areas.
they seem to just lurk under the surface of my skin
the black heads on my nose are disappearing
even the painful under skin ones
in the morning there gone the swellings down its honestly the best i got it to try it out as a mask
my pores are smaller and tighter - wahoo!
some smaller ones on my chin
it calms my once in awhile pimple down overnight!
my face in general looks very red/irritated
most of my bumps are gone
cooling sensation on my face particularly my trouble areas
however it does calm irritated areas
cheeks are noticeably smaller
my face tingles when i wear it
use it if spots flare up
it tends to calm them down
everytime i have small break outs or small bumps over my face
on my chin that appeared overnight
they just chilled on my face like bright red beacons of annoyance
they disappeared like some sort of magic trick
just wow my face tingled
i only wore a very thin layer for the recommended time
it shrunk down two huge pimples on my chin god bless this product
i literally have one pimple right now
this stuff is lit.
it even shrunk this big bump that was bothering me on my forehead
i get some rather voracious spates of acne every fall
out of trouble mask is amazing
i always wake up with smooth
was struggling with rough
dry spots are gone
especially on my cheeks
now more dry everywhere except the nose
although i was reticent about the black gel
it's placed in a little cup with a dome
you have to press the dome down
i'd rather it not have the dome
it soothed my red patchy skin
although it doesn't seem to have done much to my poor blackhead-ridden nose it definitely has improved the look of pores on my cheeks
they all felt heavy thick
because of the black charcoal it leaves a dark grey/black cast on the skin
i am usually a victim of dry spots all over my face
i dread dry spots
the dry patches stayed soft throughout the day
also very dry patches
now its time to focus more on what lies underneath
feel dry around my cheeks since being off accutane
it has to be black
dry on the sides of my face
within just a few days my pores look smaller
the skin around my eyes tends to look orange
yellow against my very pale skin
it had gotten to the point where the corners of my eyes were dry
i've even noticed that my dark circles aren't as pronounced
leaves my under eye area perfectly mositurized
i prefer this over the plantscriptions power eye cream
searching for a good eye cream for years
moderately puffy under eyes
it does lighten the area slightly which is just the bonus because: my under eye area has never looked so smooth
the lines around my eyes are noticeably minimized
in a month the puffiness around my eyes went down
soften the dark circles
doesn't tug on the eyes
cream eyeshadow sometimes tug on my eyes as they absorb pretty quickly
occasionally in the morning in lieu of the origins ginzing eye cream
even though it comes in a tiny jar
i don't have dark circles
i am thinking of trying the clinique or algenist eye cream which firms the skin area of the eye
i already see less crosshatching below my eyes
makes my fine lines disappear
i look 5 years younger and very well-rested.
doesn't make my eyes tear up or sting
helps smooth out the fine lines around my eyes
no more little fine lines or wrinkles
it reduced the appearance of any fine lines under my eyes
this really helped with my under eye circles
this is the first eye cream that doesn't sting my eyes
one morning i noticed one eye was more puffy
after using the eye area become looking more fresh
eye area seemed very drab and dark.
really noticed a smoothing of my upper eye
brighter under eye area
have used eye creams in the past that made the skin around my eyes really red
my skin was getting rather dry around my eye area
you literally just need the tiniest dab per eye so this will last a long
have noticed more fine lines just under my eyes lately
a lot of eye creams sting when i put them on
a must have eye cream.
my under-eyes are brighter
i can see lines fading
although i don't have wrinkles around my eyes yet
unfortunately i have that from rubbing my eyes a lot when i was young
it does nothing for dark circles
irritation that felt like my eye area was sunburned
doesn't do much for my dark circles.
still trying to find the miracle for dark circles
most leave me puffed up
my eyes haven't looked this nice in years.
bags are diminished as are dark circles
finally an eye cream i can live with
it is a little pricier than your average eye cream
the wrinkles around my eyes look less noticeable
my big brown eyes were getting dimmed because of crepey eye lids
too many products are for "under the eye" or crow's feet
the crepey eye lids kept that from happening
some products are too harsh to use on your eyelid or above your eye
a lot of creams cause my eyes to look soooo swollen in the morning
dark spots from sun damage/age
spots seem to be fading
small breakout on my forehead has significantly cleared up
my cheeks are still red in the morning
in a little over a month i've noticed my red marks fading

the bottle is a bit small
i only need pair with dramatically different gel on my cheeks
the slippery feeling stays for a few minutes
the dark spots from the old ones quickly faded
my usual red patches seem less noticable
along with my usual spot treatment
i catch myself caressing my own face in awe of how much younger
suddenly showing fine lines
adjusting my skin back to a steady routine
the small little bumps on my forehead are diminishing
my pores are appearing less noticeable
my skin is as smooth as a babies bottom
my fine lines are reduced
the slippery feeling stays for a few minutes
the dark spots from the old ones quickly faded
i wake up with a super smooth face
flakey skin for two years
spread it all over your face
makeup of all kinds just glided over my skin
i occasionally get very tight
dab it around my eyes
very confused about the sticky reviews
a must have for the cold northeast winters.
've used the dramatically different one the yellow tub
my eyes are more plump
it is definitely on the thick side
my dry patches of skin are gone
my under-eye area gets severely dry in winter
my under-eye area hasn't been flaky or dry since i started using it
started using it on dry patches on my elbows
red spots appearing all over my cheeks
more like a cream on the plane
i usually have peeling parts of my face
it burned my eyes
flaky all year round
my face literally glowed after one use.
while tightening up any fine lines
my eyes appear wide open
the hood is hardly noticeable
i spent a lot of time outdoors this summer so my freckles turned from a light brown to a dark brown

nonirritating on the dry areas
especially around the corners of my mouth

apply several small dots all over face
crows feet are practically gone
noticed i was getting a droopy left eyelid
the fine lines are starting to look softer
the skin around my eyes is noticeably tighter
the past few years the skin on my eyelids has begun to get crepey/lost elasticity
it hasn't worked much for my under eye circles
it has made my eyelids look much younger in only a month
it did seem to lessen the crepey-ness look of my eyelids
so maybe because i'm being more religious about taking care of my eyelids
i notice that my eyelids were looking very droopy
my eyelids look 10 years younger.
my eyelids feel tighter and are much less droopy.
i don't have a ton of fine lines around my eyes
sometimes under my eyes
i can now wear shadow again!
when i got my 30's my eyelids drooped!!!
it has its trick use it in the upper eyelids area only
at night add a dab of eye cream under-eye
have been concerned with my skin looking loose on my eyelids
so my eyelids are hooded
with very small eyelids
my eyelid skin is looking droopier the past couple years
lifting of the overall eye area
i do not have dark circles or craw's feet.
what i have is lots of fine wrinkles on my eye lids
both my parents had to have eyelid surgery for droopy lids so when i started to notice sagging in one eyelid
i am no longer staring at that eye in the mirror
this product firms the sagging eyelids of this 60+ woman beautifully
it does little or nothing to reduce puffiness under eyes or help with dark circles
no longer needing glasses which helped hide my sagging eyelids
my eyelids were really starting to look droopy
you only use a tiny bit
it is primariy meant to work on the upper eye lids
i can now even use some light metallic eye shadows
not have my eyelids look like wrinkled-up
it has also made my lashes grow
definitely helped with dark circles
was starting to notice a few faint lines beginning to below my eye
skin at eye lids is very tight now.
i also use perricone cold eye plasma around my eyes
old-slight droop on eyelid-wow-very dry
within weeks i noticed the appereance of my upper eye lid seemed smoother less wrinkled definitely would recommended
saw the eye lids starting to droop a bit
it hasn't looked droopy even though i've been sleep deprived
not my eye lid
my eyes are so bright
after a few uses i notice the skin on my upper eyelids is a wee bit tighter
a little drop hit the base of my eyelashes
- a bald spot among the furry lashes on my upper lid
it can leave hairless areas
the pump shoots out quite a bit
i start at the brow
'm hoping by the end of this bottle my eyelids are not sagging
i don't have major sagging
this feels like a mini-facelift around the eyes.
am seeing a reduction in both the droopy eyelid
a gradual lightening of the under eye circles i have
i don't have lines on the lid
you just need a tiny bit
this is wonderful for middle aged women who have crepiness in their eyelids
things are def changing in my eye area

try this if your eyelids are showing your age.
depuffs the under eye bags
really focusing on not letting my eyelids begin to sag
my upper lids have been firmed
eye lids are really lifted a bit.
this is a great product that makes your eyelid area tightened the moment you put it on
for the past year i started to notice my eyelid was becoming crepey
my upper eyelids were becoming thinner
wrinkly in a way i had never noticed before
for the past year i've been searching for an eyelid cream
i just dab the tiniest drop of this around
my fine lines are visily reduced
boths on the eyelids
i can see a difference in my sagging eyelid.
no my eyes don't suddenly look 30

use an eye cream on top
my eye lids were creapy
my under eyes were always puffy

when i smile there are less creases

it's lifted saggy eyelids
maybe made dark circles a bit less intense
under eye area are getting puffier
my dark rings are visably lighter
the deeper ones look softer
especially in my eyelids
it definitely tightens the area.
a bag that is more prominent on one side
follow with a good eye cream
using last bit on those pesky upper lip lines
i've noticed that the skin under my eyes is becoming thinner
my lids much to my chagrin are getting 'crepey'
my eyes are easily irritated
i even put it on the lines above my lips
especially on the eyelid
i've tried so many expensive eye products to battle my naturally puffy eyes
my eyelids are more visible
i am using it with the clairsonic opal under my eye area
so my eyes get puffy from goggles
firms the upper eyelid
those super-stubborn expression lines
the dreaded signs of lack of sleep
firming eyelids are staring back at me from my mirror
i feel the lightly darkened shadows i was noticing are lightening up with each application
tend to have a heavy eyelid
it seems like its taken 10 years off my poor lids
on my dark circles
i get an instant lift of my upper eyelid
it only takes a tiny bit of product smoothed over my eyelid to accomplish this miracle
i've even started smoothing another tiny drop on my smile lines under my eyes to see if it helps there as well
under eye area felt smooth
under eye area felt smooth
my dark circles are obviously deminishing
this thing actually lifts droopy/tired eyes
finally i have plus my dark circles have faded dramatically
the crease has become more smoother which is why it looks like their is more distance between my brow
i noticed brighter eye area very quickly
just from using acyl my eye shadows no longer crepe
there are not a lot of products for droopy eye lids
not look as thick
certain parts of my face consistently flake up throughout the day
to further round out my skin issues
one for my neck/chest area
i see less tiny lines when i smile
even in the little corners on the top of my nose where no moisturizer ever wants to go
especially on my t zone area.
beware getting it in your eye though!

once the warm sensation wore off my face
i've used it near my eyes with no burning
safe to use around my eyes
break-out prone skin
that leans towards the drier end
i started noticing less black pores
it's clearer and my pores are less visible.
my pores were visibly smaller after the first use

like red spots all over

there is a stick attached to it

have not noticed much change with deep forehead wrinkles
fine lines on my forehead were dramatically reduced by the morning

my face was dry and saggy.
dark marks that really make me mad waiting for them to fade
that youthful type of firm "bounce
as well as those "smile lines
still has some slip almost like a balm
my fine forehead lines have softened.
i feel as though it's already tightened my neck
those laugh lines have softened
just blurred them i'd say
all my dry patches are gone
smile lines being the most noticeable around my mouth/cheek area
it pairs very nicely with that
noticeable lines on my forehead
it really does tighten saggy areas
on the usual worry spots--forehead
these comma/expression lines that were still visible around the edges of my cheeks are basically my only complaint
nothing lifts and tightens like this one.
my biggest concern was the drooping of my cheeks
i began my algenist collection with their eye firming cream
neck skin is getting lax
neck like it says
it tightened my skin so much it crimped up
i run a lot so my neck is thin
my crows feet wrinkles are so much less noticable
tightening to my slowly sagging skin
some of the smaller lines disappeared
work it up your neck
across jaw line too
as well as some bumpiness

including a better jaw line

ironically from smiling too much
are seriously diminished around my mouth
i also use it on my neck
i look noticeably more awake
tingles tiny weeny bit
sides of my upper nose
just my eye shape
i initially ordered this product because i tend to get puffy eyes which cause the look of bags
it does temporarily firm looser skin
it's the best i have found for use in the morning on puffy sags
the women in my family have a drooping eye on the left side
to be clear, it's the upper lid.
my left eye looks 100% better.
it defiantly lifts and awakes the eye area !
it makes my lines very faint
clinique all about eyes
i can tell you my issues were drooping eye lids

the alligator scales are gone
the skin below is smooth and taunt.
have almost no droop to them
good for de-puffing eyes in the morning.
many i've tried in the past have been a variation on the same general gel- some type of blue cucumber based goop
apparently i've been missing parts of my undereye skin with the gel
that area was puffy
this is the only product that helped with my puffy under eyes
my under eye bags are no more
upper lids seem improved
eye shadows go on easily after application of the eye gel

i noticed my crows feet dwindling
my eyes looked terrible
it does tighten my upper eyelid
even somewhat deep wrinkles at the corners of my eyes
finally found something that helps the crepey under eye skin
i noticed just after a few days that the dark circles under my eyes have lightened significantly
this eye gel has lightened up my whole eye area
i look bright eyed every morning
dark circles below my eyes
it is also diminishing the depths of the lines i have under my eyes
as for the skin above my eyes
it might not help much to alleviate serious dark circles
they both soak in nicely leaving my eye area looking smooth
this is by far my favorite eye gel.
other eye gels seem to leave a shiny wet look under my eyes
deep eye lines are not as noticeable
it has firmed both under eyes
it goes on slightly slick
it has reduced the dark circles
also lifted my upper eye lids as well
is the reason for a somewhat lifted eyelid
strengthen the skin around the eyes
i used the algenist on one eye
even helps dark circles
my eyes do look lifted - particularly lids.
it made the skin around my eyes look firmer after one application
i like their other eye product better as it seems to fill in my fine lines/crow feet
causing me to look older
my eyes are lifted
deeper line going fast
i've seen some lifting in the brow area
a tiny dot goes a long way
i've noticed that my dark circles have lightened almost 90%
filling in of the hollows under my eyes

great for fine lines and dark circles
the darkness is really reduced
it has almost completely eliminated saggy eyelids
shiny around my eyes
the skin around the eyes look so much better just after one week :
down from 4 deep wrinkles
was having trouble finding a solution to combat the annoying flakiness/patchiness that appears after a couple hours of wearing foundation or bb cream
wake up with well balanced skin
my oil peeks through my foundation after a whole 10 hours
while still being plumping
my face had unusually became very dry around my mouth
especially around my mouth and chin.
after finding huge success with the black pine night cream
glowing over the course of a lot of stress
my eye shadow glides on
elsewhere is uncomfortably dry
for someone with a major oily forehead/ t-zone issue
it got to the point where the sides of my nose were flakey
the dryness still peaked through
this kept my skin looking fresh
hard to spread on the skin
itchy at the end of the day
i warm it up in my fingers
i've heard from other reviewers that the balm is too thick
as tends to be the case with bobbi brown
this has corrected my dry spots
sometimes red bumps due to overly dry skin
my forehead would get so dry that it would have tiny bumps all over
my cheeks were so dry that i would constantly have patches of flakes with or without makeup on
no bumps on my forehead, no patchy flaky spots.
not thick at all.
must warm product between fingers
it really does remove dark spots
the wild rose sleeping facial feels great
used to have some dry patches around forehead
this has the most faint
most of my deep scars have lightened
after just one use i noticed a line on my forehead disappearing
i've tried a few expensive sleeping masks
in general my face tends to lean more pink than the rest of my body
want to nip it all in the bud
even a little firmer now
well working for my shoulders
my hands look way younger!
dark spots have started to fade away
my stubbern darks spots have been a problem for years
this had lighted them
when a current pimple starts to fade this cuts down the healing time by so much
needless to say my already olive skin tone was a lot tanner in different places
due to wearing huge sunglasses
especially on my neck
has brightened up a lot of spots for me
i notice brighter dark spots
my skin looked less red
my pores were smaller which was great!
i felt like it irritated my eyes
my eyebrows are conditioned
break out prone skin
does sting the eyes a tad
looked better in general after using this balm
the only caution is that it can sting the eyes.
use fingers to spread over face
it makes my eyes sting a little-even though i keep them tightly shut
only when it got milky did i rub it onto my eyes
it burned my eyes so badly!!
no more tight red blotches!
gives my eyes blurry vision for a few minutes till it's gone
all my dry patches are gone
not good around the eyes
it left a slight filmy feeling on my face
stung around my eyes
i find that it stings the slightest bit around my eye area
a huge downside is that it stings my eyes like crazy
my skin has been parched this winter.
this balm is a smidge harder to remove compared to others
it stings if it gets anywhere near my eyes
with massaging it into the face first
i've found that i've occasionally ended up with irritated eyes after using to remove eye makeup
a like look around the eyes
all of a sudden i was faced with completely unfamiliar breakouts
i did not experience the stinging in my eyes like some of the reviewers
my eyelashes seem longer since i've been using it
the wrinkle on my forehead has never looked so tiny
i started noticing fine lines in my forehead
you can tell a difference in the jowls
the wrinkle i had across my forehead had almost disappeared
my light laugh lines also seemed to be less visible
almost as if it "filled in" some of the ridges
already the lines around my mouth are softened
right now i'm leaning toward yes
just a short line on either cheek
i like sweeping this under my eye area as well.
i can definately see results in the upper cheekbone area
have had that hollow
sunken eye look all my life
the skin is more plumped up under the eye
the tear trough is lessened too
i noticed these lines showing up on my forehead
no problems with clogging
just a few fine lines
then a line across your forehead
it's made a huge difference in my forehead lines!
i still have a few stubborn ones near my mouth
so are really good to fight off wrinkles
lines are fairly gone
suddenly you see all the wrinkles coming back
it works on super huge bags i have under my eyes.
it firms up the skin so its not so baggy.
i only have a few fine lines on forehead
we stare at our own faces daily
all the other frown lines around my face that i usually have botoxed aren't visible anymore
i think the forehead line is just the deepest
so my concerns are more fine lines than deep wrinkles
some of the lines in my face disappeared like magic
especially on my forehead
i live up in 5000 feet elevation
my skin is slowly improving
fine lines were visibly reduced
especially with my heighten of smell from being pregnant
the tip of my nose
himself to break w to breakouts with bumpy skin
this is by far my favorite face cream!
it is a mild orange zest that fades after a few minutes of application
mouth in the winter
ive tried so many things to make the dark spots fade
so, i naturally gravitated towards this cream.
peely skin in the creases by my nose are gone
some frown lines between my eyebrows
even flaky from the apples of my cheeks down to my chin
no more tugging at my skin
s: places that receive a lot of sun
not for a only eye
i get pressure pain around my ears
dot a little bit of peace of mind on my temples
when i have a tension headache i dot it behind my ears
up on to the sides of my forehead

which didn't lighten the scars at all
i've had an icepick scar on my forehead from all the way back in middle or high school
roll away my scar permanently :
turn bright red again throughout the day
nothing really faded them
my mom freaking out because my scars lightened drastically
this product is seemingly healing my scars from the inside-out
the rest were very noticeably fading
not the ones on my forehead
night the scars disappeared
fade scars o the back of my arms from picking
a sun-spot on my cheek had completely vanished
like where you would get dark circles
the mark is invisible now.
the skin under that eye now has less fine lines
some scars actually completely went away
until my face is crystal clear like it used to be
there are quite a few red dots across my cheeks
i recently got two moles removed on my face
on my upper chest
it was very frustrating to have a protruding cyst on the very tip of my nose that lasted almost 4 months
it was a dark brown color from being bruised
now it has reduced the scar made it flatter
they're pretty big scars
on both sides of my chin
nothing would touch the dark brown/purple spots beneath my chin
looking in the mirror
one of the most stubborn spots is all
this one is so useful that i see the red spot after i had pimples are vanishing
definitely could see some difference on a scar to my jaw line
all the red marks faded.
has the red marks again
it evens out her skin and fades the red marks.
i do see that the discoloration is fading away little by little
i don't notice a difference in scar depth except on my left cheek
unfortunately the right cheek is where my scarring is more pronounced
it sits on your face
mainly around my cheeks
left behind a small bump of skin that wouldn't budge
i've only used d-scar for a few days now
i apply it directly around my cheek region
the pits in my skin appear less deep
they are fading away
this is the best thing i've used to combat the dark spots acne leaves behind
old blemishes have faded dramatically
while some old scars have softened in texture
plentiful on my medium/tan face
it's made a huge difference on the overall appearance of the skin on my inner left arm
i already were using murad lightening spot gel
it even worked on my pitted scars.
it's taking awhile for the scars to fade
my scars have started to become more flat
not only do my scars look flatter
my scars became more flat!
my scars are almost covered
my cheek looked uneven even i put on my foundation
it suddenly stopped flowing out of the rollerball
on your dark spots
in certain areas on my face
only on the scarred areas
the scars used to be dark
i am amazed that more than half of the dark spots are gone
it is lightening up my red marks
my scars are not deep at all just very red.
my scars are raised
the scar has flattened 50%
for my other scars as well
while my scars aren't completely gone
after an accident i had a very jagged wound just above my lip
was even hindering my smile because it was pulling the skin
or that the scar will ever go away completely
my red marks are 85% gone
it even helped flatten a small raised scar from a cut i got on my forehead a few years back
some on my forehead
my scars are fading
the little scars seem to add up fast in those areas
left a small square shaped scar that made me self conscious
my scars have noticeably faded.
my skin always had small little bumps under the skin
i just hated those small bumps
wanted it to do more for a few deep ones on my forehead
the fine lines on my forehead have almost disappeared
there was less tightening around my cheeks
my fine lines have been smoothed out!
my forehead is the only portion with uneven texture
the mouth area ones are completely gone
the one on forehead barely noticeable
desperately fighting those stubborn aging spots
jawline as well as the under the chin down my neck
i recommend a patch test behind the ear or on the inner arm before applying all over
maybe lighter fine lines
my fine lines are looking less visible
magically erased a dozen years worth of wrinkles.
maybe i should scowl less
my wrinkles have not miraculously disappeared
it is nearly invisible
i don't the high eyebrows
wide eyes that i got with botox
soften my fine lines
after 2 weeks, my face was tighter and brighter.
in the morning i saw a little bit of skin flakes
i experienced the familiar peeling
fine lines around my eyes
lips are less visible
only on my neck
sun-damage/un-evenness signs of aging that are starting to pop up
my skin started getting red
peeling in a few spots
it is actually helping the red dry areas

this is my new go to under eye cream.
smoothed on some of the fine lines i had around my chin to boot
also really dry patches on my cheeks
and my dry patches have disappeared.
claims to lighten dark spots
perhaps it's just the skin tightening effects.
my pores have shrunk to near invisibility in some places on my cheeks
not as bad as some other sky-high items
i only use it on my nose
it's light and not over bearing.
the pore on my cheeks was always a big concern.
make these black heads dissapear
it reduced the bumps on my skin
my large pores have been an issue for me for ages
my cheeks by the t zone need most help.

hot flashes i was not having a good outlook
i also noticed slight peeling around my nose.
especially on my nose which tends to be a problem area

it really does brighten my dark under eye circles
this is my favourite eye cream hands down.
there are so many eye creams out there that claim to brighten
dealing with deep dark circles seemed unescapable coming from my south asian heritage

first eye cream i've found that brightens under my eyes without feeling too heavy
my under eye area is softer

the only really dark spots that still remain are the inner corners
my dark circles are not as dark anymore
the area around my eyes does not look dull
this product has not irritated my eyes at all.
even if it doesn't brighten my eye area
great for dry under eyes.
my dark circles are nuch lighter no longer looking like brises
slightly dry eyes buy this now
s i would still see some darkness
was also developing these white bumps under my eyes- which i was later told were because of over hydrating?
also to brighten my eye area
a little too thick that it creases under my eyes even after i let it absorb
little bumps beneath my eyes
especially under my eyes
i've already noticed the bags under my eyes getting a lot lighter
i noticed my eyes to become dry
i unfortunately have extremely dark circles under my eyes
skin under my eyes
this product has lightened up my darkness
burn my eye area
i feel my under eye area is somewhat brightened

it hasn't brightened my under eye area at all
flaky especially my under eye area
makes my eyes look more awake
found the difference in my under eye circles was less dark
my dark circles are pretty well gone
definitely softer around eyes.
had a patch of dry skin on my eyelid that would not go away
dark under eye circles
of course the darkness underneath my eyes will never completely subside
i've got a permanent wrinkle under my eyes
very blue/purple inner-corners
this eye cream has lightened up all my blue/purple spots
doesn't irritate my eyes at all
like almost every other eye cream i've tried
i see my circles lightening up a little
(little white bumps around the eyes.)
is often sleep-deprived
i suddenly had some sort of "reaction" on the skin of just one eyelid
great also as a lip balm
particularly on my eye lids
my winter skin is red
i put it on my lips, too.
i put it on dry spots all over my body
spread it all over my lips
kinda thinner than expected
some have described this as "gritty"
(i promise there is no scrubby bits to it!)
cracked patches of skin on my arms
more towards the drier side in the winter
where has this been all my dry-skinned life?
which is good for the nose
my lips are oh so soft in the morning
too heavy as cream
glowy with only a small amount
i also had a few dry patches on my h
dry ends of my hair- the possibilities are endless
my dry patches are gone
it's even toned down my roscaea so there is barely any redness
as an under eye cream
mainly as an eye cream
it leave my lips soft all day long
my nails haven't looked more refreshed
i wake up with my skin beaming.
i put it on my lips, my face my hands.
the moment i knew it works wonders is when i put it on a dry patch of skin right under my eyebrow
since then my tattoo hasnt been peeling at all
even take temporary tattoos off my kids with it
the dry patches come back
cracked--especially in the winter
so my fingers feel slightly greasy for a few minutes
once in a blue moon my lips freak out at the change of weather
they crack, blister, are tight and sore.
the bottle was sitting under a really bright hot light
use it on lips throughout the day or on my cheeks for a pick me up
on the lash line
on the brows at night
it has helped the dry skin under my eyebrows heal
my eyes look like death- this immediately fixes it
my face including eyelids
some other dry areas on my body
i mainly use it on my lips
a tiny, tiny bit goes a long way.
plus you only need a tiny bit
i've suffered from puffy eyes since i was a kid
no more dry patches and the color has evened out.
it took care of the dry patch around my nose in one night
woke up with stronger eyelashes
fine lines appearing under my eyes
my eye area looks younger
as well as helps with dark circles
expensive eye creams are aplenty on the market
light reflecting finish that this eye cream leaves around the eye is impressive on its own
either crawl into the eye area or irritate my eyes creating red bumps
i also like clinique all about eyes
my facial contours were not what they could be
lean more towards dry
this helped smooth out some problem areas
my face is not shinny
fine lines seem to be fading
two thumbs up for dior
it slips into my eye it tingles a bit
great eye cream for diminishing lines around
not only under my eyes
my eye area feels

another eye cream that irritates my sensitive eyes
when my eyes stopped watering
had some fine lines under my eyes
a few deeper ones on the outside corner
when i noticed i had a tiny bit of looseness under my eye i panicked
it takes very little to cover your eye area
it does smooth out the under eye area
my eyes are so much brighter and, tighter ...
am constantly trying new eye creams--high end
stops crease from forming under my makeup
since i don't have puffs or dark circles
it has totally diminished my fledgling crows feet
my puffiness is virtually gone as are my fine lines
this is the only eye cream in my routine now.
no eye-catching images
tip : use a little bit above your lips to prevent those vertical lip lines :
i definitely look more rested
my eye area seems to be improving slowly
brighter eyes, lines fade.
crepe-y look under my eyes now that i've been using it for 2 weeks
you're still getting smile crinkles
i don't have lines around my eyes unless i smile
i've noticed these smile lines less
the area around my eyes already looks so much better
every one of them irritated my sensitive eyes
pressed under my eyes
the dents stay there
i've never slept well my entire life so the bags underneath my eyes have always been a problem area
smoothed the lines around my eyes
helps to fill in the area under the eye that begins to hollow out as we age
3 wks i began to notice a softness around outside of eye

spreads nicely without leaving an edge in your makeup
i normally don't suffer from under eye bags
it instantly brightens up the area around my eyes
i noticed that the fine lines around my eyes were softening
i can wear eye shadow again, hurray!
this is the best eye cream i have used so far in my quest to delay my sun damaged eyelids
others made my eyes burn
my eyes now look tighter
this is the only mask that i have tried that has actually helped with the dry patches on my cheeks
i tend to have dry patches on my temples
no more dry patches!
not feel like i have some neon sign on my forehead
also plumps up the more normal skin on the rest of my face
oily places need a bit more attention
as mine is very easily irritated
seems to be prone to bumps especially that time the month
no more dry spots
make-up clinging to dry patches
i loved that it worked almost overnight in reducing flakes
i even noticed that some of my red spots
the next morning my skin was completely clear not a blemish or blotch in sight
i also use a teeny tiny bit as a nightly eye cream year round
it feels great all over the face/neck/
left a sheen on my face
itchy red patches in already dry areas
i did have a dry patch on the side of my nostril that was bugging me
the dry patch was gone
what about your eye area
i especially like it for eye area.
would always wake up with flaky patches
especially on my nose
very intense great overnight cream.
tends to lean in the dryer side closer to
i suddenly had lots of fine lines showing up
my skin tends to get some dry patches specifically around my chin
the ones around my eyes were the worst
some places on my face
after 1 use my forehead was noticeably more clear
i also love the guerlain black mask
a little tighter the next day
the brush are a great touch too
for spreading across face
even my dark spots look lighter
it does sting a little bit
it stings a tiny bit after you apply it
other times i have applied extra thick
it takes a lot of restraint to not constantly stare at my reflection when i pass a mirror or touch my face
red skin with many dry patches
i also like this better than the boscia white mask
each little container has enough for 2-3 masks
which were dark brown
were now very faint
also a spot treatment on my chin as well
for a moment i thought that it was burning my skin since it left a reddish tint on it
seemed less red also
my face was red
the mask has a little bit of a tingling sensation
the tingling sensation after applying is also a huge plus for me
the other a smaller red bump
the mask has a slight tingle
the next morning however the little pimple was gone
i like the way it spreads on the skin
this mask has some good properties: i like the brush
stings in the beginning
much easier than using my fingers to apply the mask
they were all sticking out like a little forest
instead i see white bumps where the mask has actually pulled out a whole clogged pore
i actually use this in spots where my skin is red or has dry patches
my skin is red again
dark spots have completely disappeared
are non-existent as well as my worry lines on my forehead
those annoying lines on my forehead
no heavy sticky feeling.
my face was a lot less irritated
my face had dry patches in some places
my foundation always looked like it was floating on top of my dry patches
leaves no white cast
i've seen many people say that it leaves their skin looking shiny
leaves no white cast
more oily towards the middle
it has a tendency to sit on my face
my nose is sore
burning around my nose like nothing else
as a tip i would start with three little drops warmed between the fingers
how it plumped up my fine lines
dry-ish skin in other areas
i just lightly patted my finger into some product
i would have dry patches around my eyes
normal sin areas on my face
i started to see little lines forming on my forehead
fine lines and pores are less visible too!!!
she said this would help erase my dark under eye circles
i go from looking like a puffy grouch to fresh
you wake up with plump
while plumping up fine lines
i always wake up with glowing skin.
was hesitant to use this because of the word "luminous"
no too heavy on the skin
sometimes certain areas get patchy
my skin has even brighten up a little bit after using it for a few days
i recently had a reaction to a face product that left dry patches all over my skin
my skin already seems to be clearing up
i do notice my skin looking noticeably more glowy in general after using it a few days
or splotchy spots on my face anymore since i started using this
i still have fine lines
i will rub a few drops onto my lips throughout the day
they are even less wrinkly!
have tanned my face for way too many years
hides my dark spots extremely well
no dry patchy areas to my face
gently pat in all over my phase
i put two drops on my forehead
one drop on my chin
i put extra around my nose to reduce the chafing
no more forehead lines and not a single wrinkle.
around september i developed a bumpy itchy flakey red patch around my nose
rubbed it around my nose
the red patch around my nose was drastically reduced
the mystery rash thing disappeared entirely within a week
not as plump normally
i rotate between this
i would have to blot my face
it turned my skin red
often wake up with a huge pimple the next day
i've used so many beauty products in my 25 years on this big blue earth
have always reacted badly with breakouts or little red bumps
fine lines/laugh lines
recently in colder temperatures i've been getting dry patches
it's dry in some patches
my cheeks are dry in the harsh winter here in ontario
i also use it on my neck
about the same for my rough patches on my elbows
sometimes on my forehead/bridge of my nose
red patches are starting to fade
my pores are even starting to look smaller
i notice a big difference in the faint lines forming around my eyes
because my skin is so unruly
i'll dab some midday around my eyes
i struggle with both dry skin
i put 3 or 4 tiny dots on the brush head
just needed a tiny bit and my face lathered up!
to be sure to keep eyes closed tight
shadows with no problem
lasts a long time because it only takes a small dot
recently my dry areas
my face was whitened with naturally rose red
the biggest downfall is that it leaves my skin a little sticky
it's a mild rose scent that only lingers if someone's inches from your face
my face didn't look red
no more peeling in sight
the dry patch is almost gone
flaky patches that all completely dissapeared
nice tightening sensation as well.
keeps my face soft all day long
i complained to her about flaking around the nose
the appearance of small whites heads has decreased
the flaking around my nose has stopped
a lot of people complain about the orange tint
the fact that my skin has a slight orange glow at first doesn't either
also known as sun damage
it is 40 degrees outside
no shininess after a long day
the décolletage area has seen its share of sun over the years
other people have already mentioned the orange tint that it leaves behind
i only use it at night because it leaves me with an oompa loompa orange tint
especially around the eyes
i put a little on my lids and under eyes.
it helps with fine lines too around my eyes
it does go on orange
i get most of my breakouts around my nose
diminishes red spots much quicker
i've found that it stains the collars of my shirts when i put on my neck
so be careful when using around white closing or light colored bed linens
my face was orange
my spots are fading significantly each day
they're not turning into a cyst at least
also has the same orange tone
sticky and orangish are what they both are.
although the oil is orange in colour it has never turned my face orange
i wake up looking puffy
my face has absorbed most of the oil
slightly help fade scares
the scars are fading
that my spots were fading
i would say i have nearly no lines/wrinkles around my eyes
i look wide awake and my fine lines are smooth!
my under eye circles increased
not as much as their eye cream
am right back to normal under-eye skin
i've inherited very dark under-eye circles
this has become my favorite eye cream.
except that my eyes had some fine lines
all around the eye
especially on my outer eyes
where most people see smile lines
i actually see crows feet smoothing out.
i buy eye creams to address the dark circles that show under my super-pale skin
and no dark circle reduction.
i felt most of the product was rubbing off on my pillow
please note that i suffer from hereditary dark under eye circles
also it does not sting the eye area.
i don't have any problems with my eye shadow moving around on me
it has smoothed out my fine lines
my fines/ dark circles are diminished
my favorite part is when it tingles
the oils worked well on dark circles
my under eye area seems brighter
the circles appear to be faded
as i have noticed fine lines appearing around my eyes lately
is very "crepey' underneath the eye area
my usual problem is that my eye area is super sensitive
i've noticed that the lines around my eyes
some are pretty deep
not too thick or thin
it's the first eye cream/serum i have found in years that doesn't make my eyes watery
noticed that my eyes are completely young
the darkness is still there a little
helps lose the sleep lines around my eyes
it helps some with the darkness around my eyes
a little on the pricey side
my main problem is sunken eyes
i read lots of reviews on the shiseido eye cream
my eyes looked less sunken after a few days of use
i take eye cream very seriously
i don't have dark circles
even if my eyes are swollen
it's nice to not see dark circles as the most prominent look on my face when i look into the mirror
skin still looks "wet" for several hours
inside of it was a sample of the super corrective eye cream
my eyelids stay soft
i've noticed my pores seem a bit tighter
not orange at all on my somewhat pale/pink skin
green eyes kind of pale
just that my face "glowed" just as the product depicts it
i didn't give five stars because it didn't fade any of my existing dark spots
the dark spots on my cheeks have started to lighten up
brighten around my eye area too
haven't tried it around my lips yet
my dark circles don't seem as prominent also.
within days my brown spots were getting lighter.
my brown spots are half as dark as they used to be
noticing my red spots getting brighter.
which is great for dark circles
it's like the sunshine's glowing right off my face
said there is a special ingredient that stops my dark spots from forming back together
it brightened my skin, even under eye circles.
my lines around my eyes are diminished
two drops for my neck
especially to combat dark circles
although my main concerns is dark spots
from breakouts to dark spots to fine lines
faded the darkness i have around my mouth due to sun exposure
it has all the bases covered eyes, face and lips.
also my sun spots are going away
especially after obsessing over it's eye cream counterpart
instantly brightened up my undereyes to make me look more awake
eye cream from the same line
my face is plumper in the morning when i get up
the creams that used to put me left the face bright
it helps brighten up my under eye circles
it also leaves my face with a slight glow.
i find that the pores on my nose are less visible
my face is so smooth i still keep rubbing my h
deeper wrinkles around my mouth it did not help much
not just disguised skin issues
chin all day long
the fine lines on my forehead are drastically blurred when i use this primer
no shine, no makeup sliding or creases.
hiding my red areas
make-up glides on--so less is used
this miracle primer provides an even base for my foundation so you can barely notice the hills
average 88 degrees everyday outside
the only streaks might be caused by me wearing sunglasses
so slight streaks around nose
it has reduced the appearance of blackheads on the tip my nose that usually occurs after having make-up on all day long
in my opinion better than hourglass
only need a pea size drop for cheeks & t-zone.
lines are barely visible if at all
i still suffer from the occasional break-out
i still have visible pores in my t-zone
fill in my fine lines?
was shocked to find it unusually satiny
it even helped my oily zones dramatically!
dry a bit on the top
oily a bit deeper down
even tone, tighter, pores are small and even!
don`t use it under the eyes
have started noticing some fine lines around my "expression" areas
it also smoothed out everything else
the black heads on my nose were severely diminished
it's helping the lines around my cheeks
after turning 30 i'm working hard to keep my skin smooth
i started using the eye cream as well.
that left scars throughout my face
mint seems to have some degree of effect on the deep lines on my forehead as well
dark areas have lightened
i also had fine lines around my neck that neck cream alone wasn't working
i also had some very faint lines around my mouth
love algenist eye balm as well!
firming without that weird tightness
just starting to sag around the jowls
my lines have disappeared around my eyes
gets rid of the lines around my lips
sides of my mouth as well as near my eyes
the smile lines on either side of my mouth have lessened
reduce lines/even tone/ diminish sun spots
stops forming pimples in their tracks
i've always been paranoid about developing "bulldog cheeks" with lines down the side of my nose
my cheek/jaw area is visibly smoother
it really made a difference in my fine lines on my forehead
ugly spots on my skin
even the deep wrinkles in my brow are less deep!
age spots on my face
i can see that the skin around my jawline has tighten up
this morning noticed that the dark circles are slowing diminishing
in two months i am noticing brown aging spots are disappearing
i like the way it spreads
for the first time in my life i started to get large bags with wrinkles under my eyes
this seems to be helping with the scars
just a tiny bit more for full coverage including my neck
mild, yet after using cheeks have a nice flush.
the saleswoman in sephora thought that part of the darkness was due to puffiness
the skin around my eyes still feel a little dry
fade away my dark spot surely
some of my scars have smoothed out
it appears to look not as "saggy"
even with the firming lifting cream on top
that is great too especially for my sometimes puffy eyes
my fine lines around my eyes
did nothing for forehead ones
shoulders above most other lines
totally change my skin: the "marionette" lines around my mouth shrank to almost nothing
the lines on my forehead virtually disappeared

i lean more towards the oily side
for some reason loved the stinging/burning sensation
these pads are sent from the skin gods!
after using these pads in just two days all the breakouts from the ptr pads were flattened

have a mild tingling feeling that goes away once i put on night cream
these are super intense pads, but so good.

while other users don't like the tingling/burning feeling
my skin experienced a little bit of a purge
but not too thin.
and pat on some more .
have been searching the quenching-enough mask forever
however i bit the bullet
including under my eyes

even-toned that i thought the delta lounge mirrors were playing tricks on me

a small dab the size of a hole punch is plenty for the whole face

especially when exposed to sun
after using it for a few days my chin broke out with little zits
less dark circles that i was born with
especially under my eyes

just be wary of some issues with the airless pump
i just recently started noticing deep wrinkles forming on my forehead
the deep wrinkles that were starting to form
have a few fine lines around my mouth
my skin hasn't been sore or red
i started to notice that the lines on my forehead are softening
the lines on my forehead are minimized
just be wary of some issues with the airless pump
deeper forehead lines radically improved
after about a month of nightly use i noticed a stubborn sunspot on my cheek had significantly faded
some fine lines around my eyes
it does clear up my dark spots from my occasional breakouts
my fine lines are diminishing
a few fine lines have started to slowly pop out around my eyes
dark color until i tried this
i am plagued by puffy bags under my eyes
my super fine lines are gone
this eye cream has significantly helped with the appearance of the fine lines under my eyes
the first week of using it the skin under my eyes slightly peeled
my dark circles were bad
i still have dark circles
my eyes rarely feel as tired as they used to
in the last 2 years the skin under my eyes has become crepey
my eyes no longer have dark circles
my dark circles are less noticeable
far and away the best eye cream i've ever used.
it also brightens the entire under-eye area
fine lines never looked so smooth
clinique all about eyes
i can tell you my issues were drooping eye lids
dark circles that start in the corners of my eyes
my bags under my eyes were huge
crows feet are gone.
dark circles still seem there.
after 5 days i noticed my eyes looked more "sunken"
one star off because it stings
my mininimal crows feet are banished as well!
it tingles a bit at first
these products do help with the intensity of the dark circles
- especially for fine lines and dark circle.
i've already noticed my black circles fading
have experimented with almost every eye cream under the sun
there seemed to be nothing that could solve my dark/puffy under-eye
this verso eye serum not only instantly addresses my dark under-eye circles
especially under my eyes
my under eye area is less puffy than normal
the skin under my eyes was firmer with just one use
dark circles are much lighter
started applying it above my mouth where i have terrible wrinkles from years of smoking
this is the only thing out of many that has helped with fine lines above my lips
i don't have too many wrinkles around my eyes
have some crows feet lines
find that eye crems for that make my circles look worse
give me a sort of sunken eye look
within 3 days i already see lightening of my circles
a slight lift under the eye
i chose this as a free sample because i have super dark under eye circles
it does sting a bit at first
i used clear eyes
you'd think they were getting their eyes gouged out
a bit with my dark circles
don't get it near the eyes because it stings a bit
wish they had a stronger sun screen
the eye cream lives up to it's name - super.
this eye cream does wonders for my eyes.
so naturally i have very dark under eye circles
it needs to be smoothed out- not patted on
i love knowing that my eye area is protected by the sun since it always sneaks in around my sunglasses
i go all around they eye all the way up to the eyebrow down to the top of my cheekbones from the bridge of my nose out to my temples
it initially leaves a bit of a white cast
left my eyes glowing
have been concerned about sun damage around my eyes for a while
is not irritating or stinging
the fine lines under my eyes are lessened as it is quite hydrating
did not sting/irritate my eye
it seems like a lot of money for a small tube of eye cream
so far, two thumbs up!
all day eye cream should have it for that delicate skin area
i can even put it on my eyelids for superior protection
the cream itself keeps my area firmed
sometimes it leaves white marks as spf does sometimes
i guess the only downside is that because of the sunscreen you end up with a slight white-ish cast under the eyes
know it is protecting the skin around my eyes
not to thick, not too thin.
my face is glowing the dark spots on my face kinda faded away
the large brown spot that disappeared first turned pink then faded away
i look in the mirror

they are fading quickly
the dark spots are really fading
i went on a little zit popping spree this winter
i can see some difference in the dark spots on my skin
you won't be dissapointed with its dark spot fading power
arms i realized this cream is tinted
if you are light skinned
the number 1 made the back of my hand glow!
the other 2 numbers kinda dulled my h
just beware this product is tinted
still use eye cream around my eyes
blemishes are fading away as the days go
with in days dark spots fade
broken up the dark spots
maybe leaning toward dry now
some crows feet due to my constant smiling
even worked to help my undereye area
is not looking as lifeless as it was
little lines start to disappear.
leaning more toward dry
my more problem areas are my nose and chin area.
even lips were uncomfortably dry
which is a bit rough
the eye cream just as good
this product is great for face and neck.
probably due to these annoying snow storms in the mid-atlantic :

softened the appearance of some of my fine lines
my face had a soft-focus airbrushed look that lasted all day
my scars are barely visible
lingers throughout the day
some ruddiness on my cheeks
it soes miracles for wrinklea under the eyes
it smoothed everything over a bit
the effect fades over time
however, blur was different - it didn't peel.
filled in my fine lines on my forehead / under my eyes
still waiting on dark spots
with the fine lines
am constantly worried about dry patches
i've even worn it to the gym
my dry patches are a thing of the past.
this chloroplasma mask is by far my favorite mask
i've tried several where the mask was so thick
age spots were reduced
this mask left my face clear, glowing and soft.
by far my favorite face mask
like some of my other favorite masks
have been left with terrible dark blemishes
the little burst of the tiny beads
i get red dry flaky patches of skin on my cheeks with tiny little bumps
i caught a glimpse of my reflection in a glass
chin the redness from which would hang around for weeks
this mask is more gentle than some other harsh
my pores are clearer and appear smaller.
5 stars all the way.
did a fantastic job clearing a few little clogged areas
mainly i just stuck with my origins charcoal mask
it completely lacks the stinging tingle of the glamglow line
the area right before my cheeks
i've barely made a dent in the top of the mask
my face usually get really red
itchy after i went to the beach
a couple of stubborn bumps i have under my skin are finally disappearing
i've tried so many masks
all in one mask!
it is a little bit shinny on my t-zone
spending several years in the extremely dry desert climate of east texas
tight like most clay masks
black heads much less noticeable
the ones were it takes days to flatten out
after washing it off my skin was no ionger red my skin tone was even my pores were smaller
it is so cool how the little beads burst
after using the mask it has left my skin glowing
they are fading away
the only down side is that it leaves my combination skin looking a little shiny
it also has drastically reduced dark spots on my cheek from sun damage in the past
leaves the glow like i'm talking about
the sun screen is a little on the oily side
flakiness around those problem areas
it doesn't leave a white cast on my dark skin.
after a month of using this in conjunction with the original skin serum my dark scars are faded
lightening spots on the skin while still having a high spf
adds some colour correcting which i really need for my dark circles
dark spots are my main concerns
the product is a little thick
fine lines on my forehead are less noticeable
i only use it on dark spots along with the clinique dark spot corrector
uneven skin tone with few fine lines
my hyper pigmentation around my mouth is almost completely faded
i think it's improved my under eye darkness a little over time too
clinique all about eyes rich
and makes my fine lines & wrinkles go away.

mild to moderate dark circles
it helps brighten my under eye area immediately after putting it underneath my eyes
amazing on my eyes
this did not crease or accentuate my fine lines
a plus is the fact it can be used on the upper eyelid
dark circles under my eyes

finally a product that can somewhat cover my dark circles without settling into fine lines
it awakens the eye area
takes away dark circles
it brightens the eye area leaving you looking awake

almost everything sits in my fine lines
this covers up the dark circles

my dark circles completely disappear in the morning
i don't have problems with under eye bags or dark circles

my mom has always had dark under eye circles.
this product works great on remedying the very dark circles under my eyes

i feel as if the dark circles under my eyes are intense
i'll apply this under my eyes
i even use this to correct darkness on my lids as well
perfect for minimizing dark under eye circles before applying foundation
it really brightens up my under eye area when i'm looking extra tired
i just use my finger tip
pat it gently around the focus areas
i tap a tiny bit over of them

have always struggled with dark circles
it is on the more sheer side
helped to reduce the look of my under eye circles
my dark circles are barely visible
slightly conceals my dark circles
use to help with bags under eyes
a much more natural-looking way to tackle those dark circles
the pink in the lighter one is the best product i've found to cancel out my dark circles
blue that i have
blend with my ring finger
i think 1/3 of the product now resides half-dried in the lid
there is a bit of creasing by the end of the day
nice product to even out under my eyes
also get a little brightening under my eyes
i find my eye area is rejuvenated
i don't have bags or visible lines around my eye area quite yet
self works to hide circles
sometimes the metal part just feels great on tired eyes
i've had issues with dark circles for years
my under eyes disappear
my under eyes feel less puffy
wonderful coverage that counteracts dark circles- which i have used on other reddened areas on my face- it's that good
i love the feeling of the cool metal tip on my eye area
great coverup red/dark areas under eyes
the product is great at reflecting light on bare skin
best day eye cream i've ever used hands down!!
it tightens my eye area
it corrects darkness under the eye so well.
my dark circles have lightened significantly
it also reduced the appearance of dark circles over time
i don't find this creases at all
little tiny bumps on your face
i don't have super dark under eye circles
i run the cool tip under my eyes to help with puffiness
doesn't crease or cake up under my eyes
its like finding a diamond in the rough!
tightening while it's on
my pores have shrunk a lot with continued use
this mask by far is the best mask i've ever used for brightening my skin
i've used the mask 3 times
my face is as smooth as a baby's bottom
i brought so many masks glam glow i have all 4
it also decreases the appearance of sun spots
my skin looks like it has a light coming from within
glow back after a sallow spell
my co-workers noticed how bright my skin looked also
the area around my mouth is super dry
i even use it under the eyes
sometimes on my eyelids
both areas tend to sting
as some other very watery
used them on my lips
a great side effect being it plumped my lips right up
way better than the cucumber mask.
my skin is still red
it sometimes stung a bit
i've also rubbed this in my lash line
does not irritate the eyes
although i've never massaged it into the lash line
no taut feeling before applying moisturiser
the balm would sometimes sting my eyes.
i also noticed that my pores looked smaller!
not red, it looked even and fresh and healthy.
if not a bit on the small side
-true favorites -- i put it under my eyes when i use a clay mask
the fine lines under my eyes are practically gone
my forehead lines are diminished
my face looks tighter
especially under the eye
within 2 nights my chin was no longer dried out
foundation won't go on as patchy
made it look patchy
my face was shining
the tiniest tingle at first was nice
after i have taken the mast off my skin is very bright
i moved from the humid south out to the desert so my skin has been extra dry
this mask spells nice
after a few uses i noticed my skin looking more plump
more even where my scars were
which sometimes has that effect on scars
i apologize for the blurred edges
i've had a flaky-dry zone between my eyebrows up to my hairline
it made made skin firmer even around my jaw line!
everytime i checked i saw visibly clearer skin wth scars faded
ive had a large deep pimple on each side of my face for months that i cant get rid of
my face was the tiniest bit irritated
after other face masks
several areas around my eyes
my lines were gravely reduced
yes it turns your skin red
more even toned the next day
my most hated forehead wrinkle disappeared overnight
my skin was a little red after it used it
i even noticed the lines on my forehead
around my mouth looking less visible
help the lines to fade
after an especially rough school
my skin is also becoming more even as my old blemishes fade
the marks left by recent blemishes are almost unnoticeable
the angry red burns from the at home peel are fading to a pale pinky-beige color
after the first night i noticed my skin felt like velvet
totally hoping they'll bring back the sephora favorites power of the petal some day
if also very slightly irritated
the bottle looks barely used
my face had grown complacent with african red tea
the tiny fine lines on my forehead are practically gone
it has helped reduce the little lines around my eyes
scrubbed around my eyes with it
my eyes were burning all day long
i've had no breakouts or tiny bumps around the hairline at all
those little flesh colored bumps are going away
it cleared up all those flesh colored bumps i had from oil buildup in my cheeks
i also use it on my neck
is a bit heavier for coverage
looked in the mirror
not like i painted on my face
the darker in summer
both times mixed with a bit of highlighter
keep in mind for pale white skin it will be too dark
i wore this even in tropical locations where it's so humid
i'll keep checking back for a better shade range
covers just enough that my imperfections disappear
i am a bit weary on trying new things
a few dots, blend, and go!
for years i've been wearing medium to full coverage foundations on my oily/normal skin
does not cover up dark spots
i sometimes get those on my nose or cheek
reduced my dark circles significantly
if you tend to hover around a medium-light to medium
at the very least there should be a dark shade for deep skin tones
it is a little light
it somehow glides over pores as if you have none at all
i still get shiny
not enough coverage or strange colors
my skin iin winter is slightly lighter than colour
as opposed to looking like i'm wearing a mask
no real help if you have dark circles or spots
give a little bit of coverage
a few drops for my whole face
tarte's tinted options seem heavier in comparison
it is still a little dark
i took 1 star off because i'm pale
noticed that my skin looked really great on camera
some sun spots much less noticeable
any more and i look quite orange.
as i have uneven skin.
i still feel amazement when i pop out my mirror
break out prone skin
sitting in my lines
lately i have been feeling like it looked shiny
i notice at the end of the day i would break out one pimple on my cheek or chin somewhere
great for taking care of those little blemishes that may pop up over night
any puffy eyes are diminished quickly
it tingled for about 5 minutes
not as red as usual
my puffy eyes went down
a bit of anthony's instant fix oil control on my nose
backs of my hands look noticeably better too
plumped my forehead lines as well as a deep wrinkle i have in one of my laugh lines
my fine lines have softened
it has faded some deep lines
then i use a few more drops for my neck.
especially in between the eyebrows area
have recently suffered a dry patch of skin around my cheek
i wake up glowing
a few drops of this on top of origins intensive drink up mask
seems to fill in small lines around the eyes
sensitive around my eyes
my dark circles became darker
i still have dark circles
addresses all eye concerns with the exception of dark circles
think heavy cat eye
restore the skin around my eyes
my eyes were always irritated.
they are never red, crusty or irritated.
mild/moderate crows feet
get it too near my eye crease
is keeping my wrinkles at bay
not wake up with very puffy eyes
it is helping my dark under circles little by little
this product helps with dark circles around eyes due to lack of sleep
helped improve my under eye lines
my makeup would crease badly under my eyes making me look older than i am
it is really helping with my dark circles
so far is keeping my dark circles at bay
more than fine lines my issue is dark circles.
've got some fine lines around my eyes
the inner corners of my eyes as well before starting use of a n eye cream
i started with a different eye cream
often got into my eyes
my dark circles are naturally quite dark
this product keeps my eye area
thanks to this cream my under eye area is now softer
my dark circles are almost gone
my under eyes where really dry
the jar seems small
my under eyes gets dry
i don't have issues with dark circles
my dark circles have faded slightly
my eyes are bright
so many eye creams are off-limits
/or night to help with my dark circles
i can feel it tightening my eye area
my fine lines have faded alot
my skin had a rough winter with dry patches
the skin around my eyes was typically dry
usually i feel burn my eyes with others eye cream
her eyelids were literally cracked
many times my eyes are just tired
since nearly every other eye product i've tried irritated my eyes
doesn't irritate my eyes at all
a little goes a long long way: dime-sized dab is enough for both eyes
a very small dab is needed to cover both eyes
i first bought this when i had some painful dry patches on my eyelids
this eye cream made my fine lines even more fine.
now i can only see them with 5x zoom mirror
over the eyes by your brows
i am starting to see some tiny fine lines forming under my eyes
they were so flaky
no more flaky eyelids!!
perks up tired eyelids
i didn't have any issues with my make up creasing or sliding around
my eye area was very dry
keeps my tired looking eyes at bay even with being at college
my under-eye area would flake a little bit
it looks like scales on a fish.
i can't say if this has brightened my dark undereye circles
really far away from actual eye area
my under eye area stings
doesn't help with the wrinkle or dark circles
doesn't become stiff or crusty under eyes.
i like the black tea one better
it sinks into the eye area perfectly.
very dark under eye circles
the skin around my eyes look very dry!!!
my scar has faded
sun spots on my face
other lighteners or dark spot correctors actually only brighten the area
my dark spots were a smidgen lighter or the area around the spot was lighter
it has seriously lightened many of my ugly sun spots
then tightening the skin around my nose
i just so happened to have a red zit forming on my nose
i wish they had a mask that covered my cheeks
not just the nose
best nose strip i've gotten.
left my nose looking pore less
this is my go to nose patch for sure
it's a little steep... 1 patch for $8?
the patch is a little smaller than the drugstore kind
you have little "trees" sticking out
once on my nose
wish there were forehead & chin strips too!
definitely not the stripes you buy at the drugstore
i won't ever use another nose strip.
pull out a lot of white heads!
not the tiny ones
if they are raised, it's a black head.
there was still some left in my pores
my eyes were watering like crazy
seemed to calm down my angry pores
to try on my chin as well
the drugstore strips were not working for me
i wanted to be able to tighten my pores instead of leaving little gaping holes in my face
the dry strip gripped really hard
especially from the sides of my nose
the peach fuzz takes a little longer than that to grow back
i usually have tears in my eyes by the end
it's also a little too large for my tiny nose
don't catch too much skin underneath my eyes
this is the best nose patch i've ever tried.
look at your strip at an angle
pulling off the dry patch is a little intense
still a paltry number considering the amount of blackheads that are actually on my nose
my nose is always congested
especially on my nose
the first strip did remove quite a few blackheads from the sides
50 per strip is definitely a bit steep
now i just wish they would make strips for the forehead/chin
i suppose the nose strip would work just fine in other areas
i used the boscia black strips for a long time
a little intense to peel off
i've tried so many black head strips
judging by the dry strip
the skin at the bridge of my nose got a little damaged
i've always hated the black heads on my nose
so the first step is just a regular pore strip.
i noticed it stuck better than some of the other pore strips i've tried
my nose wasn't red or irritated afterwards
most of the time pull off whole chunks of dry skin around my nose
there's some tingling from the tea tree right after you put these on
as with any nose strip
my main complaint with these is the strips are too small
a bit on my cheeks
really seem to fade out the wrinkles
besides the dark circles i also have bags which make me look tired
i cautiously tried the daytime cream
you should dot along the base of the eye socket
further from the lash line
i am also fair with some pretty dark circles
it burned and my eyes watered and were bloodshot.
i ply that on all around the eye
i looked less tired, worn down.
the day creme stings your eyes for a few minutes
on the most delicate part of your face
bags under my eyes as well as very fine lines
spf all over the face including around the eyes is good defense against aging
nose are getting bumpy or clogged up
it was a different consistency then a clay mask
have extra sensitive skin that turns red
was a little tough to rub off
as it dried down the tingling turned to a pleasant fresh sensation
sometimes dab a light spot on an upcoming pimple overnight
when i use it as a regular mask my skin is left looking so bright
mainly under skin bumps
it definitely stings at first
my face was a little tight
it reduced the puffiness almost completely by the morning after when these tend to get worse
it's relaxing, tingling & tightening.
it pulls my black heads to the top
know that it will sting/tingle
it's on my face, hands, and elbows.
i'll take black or white one
it immediately started burning on my cheeks pretty bad
i love the black one, white one & this one.
i've never had major luck with glam glow masks until now
i've tried a lot of other masks
i didn't see the instructions clearly labelled on the small container-just to avoid eyes
ever so slightly tighter
am enduring the increasingly drying skin of nearing 50 years old
my face is oilier this product is back in regular rotation
after 3 weeks of faithful nightly use my skin looks bright
now, my dark spots are not gone but very faded.
i like it - some nights it tingles but, mildly.
it literally turns me orange.
it has firmed my area around my mouth
a little improvement on neck lines
i do tap it around my eyes as well.
they're the worst around my mouth
it was suddenly brighter
the between the brows area
my sad eyelids- within 24 hours my eyelids are back to normal
helps to get rid of dark spots
my bags started becoming more visible again
in the morning my eyes are fresh looking
i even noticed in the little video clip it shows the model grabbing way to much product on her fingers
the darker bags under my eyes are no longer there
i also use it above my upper lip.
my under eye lines are way less visible
i didn't have deep lines around the eyes they were small lines i noticed
i do wake up with puffy eyes
no puffy eye the morning
also makes your eye feel tight in the morning
but you wake up with no puffy eyes!
cooling to the under eye area
i wake up with eyes that seem much more alive
i used it on one eye
crossing my fingers it works for me!
having seen my eye lids where to put shadow/liner at my lash line
my drooping eyelids have drastically improved
and my eyelids have serious dropping going on.
my eyes are lifted
my under eyes looked alive
have little or zero winkles under my eyes after 1night of use
has reduced the deep wrinkles under my eyes
seeing the fine lines creep up again
my eyes are as bright
the skin around my eyes even seems to glow
the one down side is the sticky feeling
as someone who has had puffy eyes my entire life
nothing really worked for my puffy eyes
i apply at night to my eyebrow area
my eye area is tightened
a very little is all you need to put on both eyelids
helps those with lightly hooded eyelids feel more open eyed
my eyes are more open
my hood is lifted
it's one of the very few eye products that doesn't irritate my eyes
i already see an improvement in my typically puffy eyes
my under eye wrinkles have calmed down
less puffy eyes in the morning
it does make your eyes look less droopy in the morning
skin around eye area feels tighter.
there are less creases under my eyes
i rub some muddy things around my eyes after i applied another layer of eye product on this eye gel
that shows up on you with swollen eyes
i will also use in the am if my eyes are extra puffy
it's eye cream meant to tighten up the skin beneath
it actually works in shrinking the under eye puffiness
the dark circles i would wake up with
disappear immediately like an eye cream
calmed my puffy irritated tired eyes
this is the best product i have ever used for de-puffing my eyes
the skin around my eyes is rejuvinated
it instantly soothed my eye area
after looking around at other sephora products i noticed that several gels were for both eye
hmmmmso i tried it around my lips.
it healed up my cracked lip edges
even reduced my laugh lines
i normally have terrible dark circles
painful even though i used an eye cream day
i put just a tiny bit under each eye
her under-eye area was so much less puffy within 15 minutes
i suggest useing it with the day cream for an all day bright lifted eye appearanc
i do not have puffy eyes at all
i notice a difference already as well as sagging/droopy eyelids
firms the eye area i cant say for de-puffing i don't get puffy eyes
tried it -- the tiniest dabbing under my eyes -- under makeup
i really only dab a tiny bit under each eye.
yet the ultimate lift eye gel soothes my under eye area by morning
my eyes look less tired.
on my eye area
it feels cooling on my eye area
puffy eyes be gone!
i see instant de puffing under my eyes
well i dont have dark under eyes
what something to help with puffy eyes then my friend
vola under eye cotton mask
notice a visible difference in the tightening of my hooded eyes
crying my eyes out
great for de-puffing under eye bags.
i developed a rash under one of my eyes
i started after noticing my 40-something eyelids we're getting really crepe-y looking
it also does a great job of tightening the skin under my eyes
usually the 3rd of 4th whitest shade in most foundations
it has helped lighten my dark circles under my eyes
my eyelids had started to sag to the point of being hooded
after using this stuff, i have creases again.
the little lines around my eyes have almost completely faded
my under eye looks so much brighter all day long.
i noticed no more puffy eyes in the morning after just one week
i wanted to de-puff my eye area a bit
tried many eye cream.
i'd noticed an additional fold in my eyelid
started using the gel again at night to see if the weird crease in my eyelid would smooth out
i wake up with a less red
don't use on any blemishes that are open or super inflamed already
my pores looked tighter afterwards as well
it stings a little when first applied to the skin
i feel like my dark spots left from previous breakouts look a lot lighter now
it stings a little at first
especially since my pores are big
this stings at first
it does sting a tiny bit at first
it stings a little at first but it passes.
my large red zits were almost completely gone!
it did sting a little
i did have a little darkness around my mouth
my face is red
the second use it tingled around my eyes
my skin has never been red or irritated
by the time the mask is completely off my skin is bright
when first applied i was somewhat frightened by the slight burning
there was a sort of glow to his face
it turned my skin from feeling clogged
unlike other masks i've tried
is not too irritating compared to other masks
it leaves may face a little red
this mask is not for the timid!
it definitely tingles a lot more than other aha masks i use
this is coming from a gal with pits in my skin from cystic
bordering on burns when it is on
bump on my skin
i feel like it tackles smaller blemishes too
this mask stings quite intensely while wearing it
it still tingles when i apply it
it did tingle a little bit
taut feeling all over my face
my face was not red or irritated
may have to pop the lid just to sniff in between uses
the small clogs/bumps i have diminished
my forehead lines are almost gone
there is a lot in the jar
i feel like 2 layers of dead yuck came off of my face
the jar seems to last forever
it did sting a little
this mask is my go to mask when my face is looking dull
very dry on the surrounding areas of the face
for me i barely even feel it- maybe a little tingle around my nose
i get little heat bumps on my forehead from sweating
it's even safe for around the eye area
my breakouts are kept at bay
more on the dry side
it has kept breakouts at bay as well.
no tight or squeaky feel
that could just be due to the fierce winter wind lately
leave my skin red
no stinging the eyes, either.
really helped me with my dark spots
most of my scars are faded
the skin under my chin has firmed up
after looking thru her magnifying eye piece to see details of my teeth
turn red when neglected
most tend to shy away from it
the fine lines under my eyes are already disappearing
so a few day's ago i had a really bad dry area near my lips
i put on all over the rough patches
some of the fine lines around my smile were also gone by morning
it didn't irritate the skin on my face or neck
the fine lines are disappearing
this product is a little thick
wake up with glowing
day 29 my fine lines are smaller
red patches on my face
works great to reduce light lines on the forehead
wasn't really improving my dark spots or wrinkles
my lines have softened and are going away.
my skin is pretty clear besides very minor bumps on my cheeks
a pump on my neck
don't forget your ears!
when i see people with dry ears it's so gross.
the dark spots are fading
certain spots on my chin are oily
any time my skins red or irritated after using a strong face mask or something
dullness in the face
i can only attest to its effects on dark spots
definitely helped dark spots
i first worried that my face looked a bit oily
have wanted botox for many many years because of the lines on my forehead being so pronounced
i noticed that a large pore on my face basically disappeared
my dry patches have completely vanished
within the last year i noticed the faintest hint of a line in the top corner of my forehead
my faint line is literally gone.
works on the deepest layers of the skin you have to keep wearing the usual contour eye cream above
with a few dark spots
awful under eye bags
dark circles under my eyes
lightened my dark spots
my previous scars were slowly
i trade off using this with the even better dark spot corrector classic which i love
i like the idea of fighting sun damage
i've noticed that my sun spots are fading
discovered the fine lines in my forehead were disappearing
when i put under-eye cream
i've also noticed a dark spot fading!
saw results after just one use on deep forehead wrinkles
i first tried it on this little wrinkle developing on my forehead
a little around the eyes
more even in tone
reduced the appearance of a skin coloured mole on my nose
the clinique side had very noticeably reduced dark circles
used only the clinique on both sides of my face
there is a softening of the slight folds by my mouth
in 2 days my lids are healed up
have some small brown spots
my dark circles would almost disappear completely
these days it's toned down some
it helped minimize my red marks by 80%
had some minor lines around my mouth
my face is less red from breakouts
any fine lines i had are faded
especially on my chin/around my mouth
sun spots are gone/fading
however now that i am getting a little older i am noticing some dull dryness
fine lines on my face
this along with the eye cream
yes i still get the occasional spots
saggy skin under my eyes
s along my lash lines
this eye cream has people fooled
stick with it for a bit
i currently use the facial night cream of the black pine line
they're already barely there.
it burns my eyes at night
it says to avoid upper eyelid
my concerns are lines, texture, & dark circles.
all over eye area
lighten the area around the eye
my eye area no longer looks all dried up!
doesn't slip into my eyes
my eyes looked tired recently
this eye-cream really fixed the situation
fine lines around the eyes are gone
dark circles are still there though
i've noticed some smallish red spots under my eyes when using it
my lids were becoming a bit crepe paper looking
after about a month of this my lids are smoother
my crows feet are less noticeable
the bags under my eyes have visibly decreased.
it hasn't helped the dark circles
with mostly middle aged oily skin with some dry patches
my dark circles are gone
smooth the under-eye area
although caudlie's discontinued eye/lip cream was the best
i started noticing little wrinkles under my eyes
dark circles are slightly lighter as well.
i am finding that my eyes are brightening up
my little laugh lines/wrinkles are starting to fill back in
my dark circles are still there
it can sting a bit
if a blotting finger gets too close to the eye
only on my lower lid
my dark circles are beginning to fade
working nights leaves me with puffy dark eyes.
my new go-to for the sensitive eye area.
black pine is no exception
it helped reduce the dark circles under my eyes due to lack of sleep
the eye cream is no exception
it demolished the slight "sag" more like a crepe type look within 2 days of use
neck then workimg upwards my face i also do behind my ears
my forehead lines have decreased by 75%.
they have a separate eye cream
barely any on my nose
just a little dab goes a long way
the next day my pores were much smaller
you have to constantly touch up
black pine is no exception
let it sit on my face while i brush my teeth
i top it all off with a thick cream
i found that the fine lines in my forehead
deeper crease between my eyes have become more of a problem
i can see immediate results in the smoothing of the lines in my forehead/between my eyes
smoothing those pesky lines
generally trouble-free skin
uncomfortable on that spot
cheeks without leaving me irritated or red
the small zit on my chin completely disappeared
it faded a stubborn dark scar next to my mouth after one use
the texture is a bit rough to spread around
just add a bit of water with my fingers
it had a slight tinge at first
that faded fairly quickly
deeper creases were less noticeable.
my face is a little tight
it goes on slightly gritty.
especially when i have to be on camera
brightened up some of my sun spots
it is quiet heavy
usually followed by a suspicious follow-up query as to what i'm doing to maintain my unlined forehead
finelines on my forehead are plumping up
made all my dry patches disappear
a bit sticky at first
they both are slightly sticky for just a few minutes
glowy my skin got over the course of a couple of days
i remember looking in the mirror
the next morning lines were less visible

i watched it instantly fill/blur my forehead wrinkles like i've only ever seen one other product do

it has caused me to have awful brow furrowing lines at the age of 25
my under eyes didn't look that sunken in.
they are barely noticeable unless i "pucker up"
it's also made a huge difference in the lines between my brows
just this crease from squinting between my eyebrows that i am self conscious about

i'd focus on the under eye area
my eye lines are seriously 95% gone !

starting to have lines aroudn the eyes
big horizontal ones across the forehead
i put it on some little wrinkles under my eyes
some around my the corners of my mouth

between my brows were getting worse

frown lines very visibly
i can feel the difference when i touch the skin above my eyes
specifically on my '11's' between my brows
my expression lines are not gone
crow lines have smoothed out
neck lines have diminished as well.
however, it does lesson lines and wrinkles.
during my monthly my face goes crazy with blemishes
i still have some dark spots from all the pimples come
for reference, i have oily skin and dark spots.
my dark spots have definitely faded since i started using this product
my skin has gone rogue
with the occasional use as a thick mask
everywhere on my face
my forehead problem area cleared up.
my cheek had a big cyst that shrunk overnight as well
it even tingles a little
little bumps all over my face
the glamglow mud is clearing all these problems
love and has kept my mild ance/blemishes at bay.
its a steep slope when you start using the good stuff
more on the dry side
it has always seemed like as soon as one zit would disappear
the occasional nasty breakout
prone to flakiness in the nose area during the cold
they are my staples.
my mouth was starting to get rough patches by the chin
i seriously only use 3 small drops on my whole face
activating it with a little bit of water
my face is no longer red
they did not complain of stinging in eyes
it is a little on the expensive side
i love massaging my face with it
i love spending a good 5 mins massaging this around my face
i see a difference in my dark spots
neck- i would suggest massaging it for a bit
i then dampen my fingers
word of caution: steer clear of your eyes!
my jaw line is also firming up
got rid of my dark spots
the clear parts are so soft

from wearing v-necks

especially around my eyes
within days had millia on my eyelid

my biggest eye issue is that i have pretty dark circles
the skin under my eyes is also very bumpy
my dark circles have slightly improved
my dark circles are better
dark circles are definitely lighter
noticed some glitter in the product as well
my eyes are so dry
i've noticed my eyes aren't as dry
it has helped with the crepiness of the upper lids
so happy with the results of my upper lids!
not irritate the eye area
i can tell that my under-eye area has been less puffy since using hope in a jar
it hasn't done anything for dark circles
just starting to notice some fine lines under my eyes
my eyes look less puffy
particularly right below the eyes
this eye cream has been great at keeping dry skin away from the under eye area
was hesitant for the eye cream
a few bumps around my lash line
the "crepey" look is gone
i think it has helped with my dark circles under my eyes
on the inner bridge area
dark circles under my eyes in large part due to allergies
the dark circles have improved a bit, too.
some days it’ll be as parched as the sahara desert
so no raccoon eyes the next morning
it would tug on my skin
eye makeup tends to be more stubborn
with a bit more rubbing
even eye make up
quite shiny face i have.
i still have some dry patches
even when i wear a cat eye
my bumps are gone
bumps are barely there
like the argan oil which still left my eye makeup behind
a week later my skin was back to looking duller
also battling the first signs of aging
no more raccoon eyes and no more dry skin
i rub it on my eyes
was also gentle on eyes
it even created my first ever milia around my eyes
i also do my neck
have been dealing with some pretty gnarly dry skin around my eyes
thick like the others
also apply it under my eyes
on my eye lashes
my lashes have most definitely grown longer
i definitely had no intention of the marula oil growing my lashes
i rub a little oil under my eyes
use some around your eye area
it helps with the little dry patches i have on my cheeks
flaky in the winter
i only use around the eyes
a few drops on my hips
baby bump helps some of the tightness of my stretching skin
dry patches around my nose
i do deal with rough patches
i wake up glowing
my skin is super prone to break outs
night the last couple days those stubborn red marks are fading before my eyes
i wake up with an incredibly fresh face that is practically glowing
like it is breathing a sigh of relief
by morning my face is very plumped
i bit the bullet
the white/yellow combination
the dry patches are now gone
bumps would have disappeared
dry patches would be invisible
around the sides of my nose
as time went on i slowly started noticing that my uneven skin was looking brighter
my pore size around my nose was starting to shrink
the one with the pink top
fine lines under eye/ cheeks
no balling up like other stuff.
temples- two places i never break out
after a few nights i've found my skin a lot healthier looking
a little under my eyes
my huge on my nose cheeks
chin are almost completely gone
at first my face was a little bit oilier than normal
cheeks was completely gone
i've noticed after i wake up that all of my scabby acne looks a lot better
all the nose strips in the world can't clear it up
my hand was like legit glowing.
my only warning is its a slippery slope into drunk elephant
fyi if you have any open nicks/pics spots on your face
they are really disappearing
only to breakout in odd clusters-
i've also noticed my pores are tighter
maybe my skin got little worst loll
also the larger pores around my nose area looked smaller
love waking up to smooth
bright when i look up close in the mirror
they where not bumpy they where flat which made it easier to conceal
which left me with lots of really big pores
little bumps under the skin
i normally break out in cycles on my chin
tone of my skin along with keeping my breakouts at bay
have just been wearing a light coverage concealer under my eyes for dark circles
my dark spots have either faded or disappeared
while brightening serums have taken an "edge" off of them
chin are basically invisible
i also use this on my neck and chest.
it really helps with those chest lines too!
so ill forever use this for my chest.
reduced the appearance of some of my spots
i happened to have a pimple on the side of my chin
i already see my pores on my sides of my nose literally gone
then i noticed i was getting dry patches especially around my mouth
get red/dark spots that stay for months
fades age spots and reduced lines.
i've tried so many masks
my scars aren't completely gone
i still get an occasional spot every now
they are teeny-tiny
looks like a red spot rather than a bump
my larger pores around my nose are noticeably smaller
the fine lines on my forehead have disappeared
made my face an oil slick
its more calmer now
the small pin dot like texture i had right under my eyes
moving down the tops of my cheeks is close to gone
scarring on the sides of face has begun to fade
they are teeny breakouts that are gone within the day
mostly i find no tingle with application
has for sure shrunk my black heads
just occasional breakouts around my chin
i felt that my bumps
baby facial are all beyond amazing
albeit nervously because i didn't want to mess up the acne progress i had made
they aren't deep-under-the-skin problems
if i do get a pitted scar
resurfaced my face without any irritation
i can suds up my eyes with zero problems
can even be used around the eyes with little to no irritation
the dullness is gone
these bars are so gentle
it doesn't irritate my eyes
not rough at all
except for my nose
it does sting a little bit of it gets in my eyes
all that seems to be blurred out during the time i wash my face
my skin was semi red
both the bars are so refreshing on the skin
along with several other products in the drunk elephant line
it is a tad on the drying side
little bumps on my fave were gone
my somehow bumpy forehead
t's worth it in my eyes
it barely looks like i've used much of the bar
my forehead seems a bit clearer
my breakouts have mostly cleared up
it not too rough
but i have far fewer blemishes with the juju bar.
which i'm mostly okay with
it's fine around my nose
have also used the white bar
glowy that people started noticing
my face breaks out in hives with many products
it tingles the first few times you use it
these bars are so gentle
this facial bar...hunty.. is everything!
i usually dampen my face
rub it in circular motions all over
i didn't notice a bit of dryness around my nose
my dry spots are gone
the ones from the day before were barely visible anymore
the eye cream at this point
has really tamed my skin
it practically burned my skin off compared to how gentle
areas around my nose
mostly because i like elephants
i noticed a little dry patch here
its really rough on my chin it hurt my pimple
every winter my combination skin leans more to the dry side
temples had been so dry
less breakout on my chest
i started using it on my shoulders where i also tend to get breakouts
even dark spots have faded
it says to avoid eyes
have lots of fine lines
three deep creases on my forehead that never seem to go away or effectively be hidden through makeup
benefiance softens my lines for about half a day
my pores have gotten visibly smaller
last year i suddenly developed sun spots at the top of my cheeks
the elixir has faded them to almost being unnoticeable
i also had dark circles under my eyes
having used it-with trepidation as i have congested skin prone to breakouts- for over a month
the cold was relentless
i no longer have an oil slick on my forehead by lunchtime
my spots are almost completely gone
my wrinkles on my neck are virtually gone after 1 use
seems other people are noticing too because i keep getting second glances
have very droopy eyelids
while my lids still droop there is a very noticeable improvement
not only in my eyelids but my whole face.
i only run in a few teeny tiny drops at night.
this here is the gentlest
my usual congested pores are looking so much better
my face gets incredibly red after workouts
my skin has a tendency to turn red r
which irritates my face badly
left the worst oil layer on my face
young adult to the other clearing up my skin completely
both irritated my eyes if i get too close to my eye area
i never cover my eye area
my eyes would still be watering for a while
on my eyes without irritation
sides of my nose were so oily
while the rest of my forehead
bridge of my nose was dry
there's always a small voice in my head that says
despite that little voice
doesn't irritate my eyes at all
and it doesn't irritate my eyes
like it's heavy in weight in my hand.
have had no problems with mascara or liner running
i would've liked a thicker plastic on the top
for eyes i use something faster
the goatee is gone
lightly rub all over my face
i found this to be okay for my dark circles
amazing to conceal my pores around my nose area for some weired reason
chin area are slightly oily
eye area are incredibly dry
i rubbed it around my eyes
not harsh on my face
it took off the blackest eyeliner all the way down my lash line
i don't normally have puffy eye issues or dark circles
it definitely helped with my puffy under eyes
even brightened the area
i wake up with puffy eyes every morning
this somehow made my eyes look less gag _immediately_
love the cool feeling on my morning puffy eye bags
i tried a sample of this product on a few days when i had really puffy eyes from lack of sleep or crying
who has been suffering from puffy bags of late
it is great for swollen peepers
i put the product on my fingertip instead of using the pointy iron as it is awkward
have used soooo many products for puffy eyes an dark circles
good for depuffing not dark circles
it really works at getting my under eyes looking more alert
i looked at my weird shaped
although i don't have very puffy eyes
see how it does brighten the eye area a bit
that little iron works wonders both on my eyelids
this is a must-have if you suffer from regularly puffy eyes in the morning
every morning i have a big deal trying to conceal my puffiness
my dark circles for the same reason
they were practically unnoticeable

my cheeks are back to their red color
my face is dry with a few problem pore areas
my skin got noticeably tighter
you only need a tiny bit
thumbs up so far!
i wear a lot of face makeup to cover up my overly red cheeks
my ache is clearing up
the scars are fading away
one of the main problems that i have are dry spots
how it sits on the skin
not offensive to my nose
i've struggled with dry patches for a while
it left deep fissures underneath my eyes
my dry patches on my cheek bones are long gone.
with k-beauty popping up everywhere
my dry patches on my cheeks paid for it
still filled with scales
which was stinging my face
flaky in others particularly under my nose
am still plagued with sensitive skin that likes to breakout
i still don't like digging my fingers in the jar
s tend to sit on top of skin like a shield
a few tiny dots and your face is covered.
now that we're moving into the warmer
i've ordered 3 big jars so far
it kept my dry areas
it completely removed all of those bumps
just be careful around the eye area
my face afterwards looked so plump and rested.
dried patches on face is absolutely nauseating looking
the little bumps under my eyes have gone completely away
when the weather cools down the skin near the outside corners of my eyes get very dry
around my entire eye
lids went from the driest they had ever been to smooth
i've tried several eye cream
then do an eye mask on top for some extra loving
combats fine lines in the corners of my eyes
i do not have dark circles.
itchy skin around the eyes then give this a try
i feel like its starting to brighten my under-eye area
now i notice the lines near the lower lashes
don't have a neck cream
my face features: medium skin tonemy age: late 20's
it also feels cooling around the eyes.
dark circles are gone
i love this mask because it really does reduce the appearance of dark spots
you wake up with a brighter face
the little beads inside aren't rough.
my face does seem noticeably brighter the next morning
my face was darker than usual because of the sun exposure i got during my diving trip
desperately need something to brighten it up
calm skin that is way less red
even my dark spots
blemishes are fading to the point where i don't have to pack on concealer on problem areas during my makeup routine
they were red on my tan skin.
theyre very faint now
my face still has dark spots
even on my time of the month i only got 2 tiny pimples
it seems to have lightened one of the marks on my face too
not interested in peeling it off
it isn't as thick as some other masks
there that i couldn't grasp with my fingers
having dark near my hairline
above my upper lip looked unattractive to me
it's definitely correcting my dark spots
it's also brightening my entire face
it spreads nicely over your entire face
helped minimize lines on the neck
has fixed my dry patches.
my forehead no longer looks like an oil slick
my eyes would get irritated
even more gently over closed eyes
my eyes were significantly less crepey than before
the skin around my eyes is visibly firmer
this stuff hasn't clogged the delicate skin around my eyes
there is a visibly different look to my eye area
both under my eyes
smile lines directly under my eyes
i typically have horrible dark circles under my eyes no matter how much sleep i get
especially eyes that may water
i do use either algenist or ptr eye creams at night to combat dark circles
yet leaves my under eye area plump
the fine lines around my eyes are gone
makes my under-eye brighter when used regularly
i only use a tiny bit for both eyes
i always come back to this eye cream.
under my eye area
only a slight tingle after application
have had dark circles my whole life
its helped combat my dark circles
i noticed my eyes are a bit brighter
not heavy eye cream
have been rubbing my eyes my whole life
remember to massage a little bit around the eye
i tried literally 30 different high to low end eye creams
this cream erased my craws feet
sleep lines under my eyes
my under eyes are much brighter
my fine lines look less "fine liney"
i don't have dark circles
have some slight fine lines i've been battling forever
little white bumps... gone.
error that left me with milia on my cheek
not on my under eye quite
after using this eye cream for 2 weeks i noticed a huge difference in dark under eye circles
this eye cream has changed my eye area!
i struggle with very dry under eyes along with those little white dots
within a week the skin under my eyes has become so soft
every eye cream i have tried irritates my eyes
laugh lines around my eyes
those small little white dots
i see the creases under my eyes becoming smaller
am always squinting my eyes when i'm analyzing something plus i work with criminals
i wear shades everyday while outside to beat that issue
i even put it on my lips
my lips are looking so cute
now i don't feel so disgusted whenever i saw dark circles around my eyes
every other eye cream i've tried either makes my eyes burn or the underside stay red or my eyes look like an oil slick
the cream irritated the skin around my eyes
my eyes are still smooth
those tiny lines i have under
around my eyes have diminished
dab all around your gentle eye area
fine lines have vanished
i guess using sun screen on top of it will reduce the golden glow effect
i got the yellow
the yellow lotion is better for people who look better wearing silver
very oily in some spots
whose eyes are not are teary as mine
my dry cheeks are no more!
the dropper is a little awkward
my favorite trick is to mix about four drops of this into the josie mud mask
i am dry under my eyes
i spread it all over my fingers
doesn't spread easily over my face
then do my brows
the flare ups were getting worse
had a tough time swallowing the price
on my sunburned face
firm effect when mixed with face cream or eye cream
the appearance of my dry red patches is almost gone
cream: mixed all in my palm
my feet are noticeably not as dry as usual
no more fine lines around my eye area
neck has smoothed out
no dry spots on my skin
have seen my fine lines smooth out
the mud side is a bit annoying
i still had small bumps cascading across my forehead
i also get extremely dry around the perimeter of my faces
i tend to break out on my forehead
usually have some annoying black heads on my nose
my black heads are legitimately gone
my breakouts have pretty much disappeared
with all the problems my skin faces
a couple washes with this guy will fight back any looming blemishes
then spread evenly on to my face
my pores are noticeably smaller after only 3 days
i am definitely on the oily side lately
the very faint expression/laugh lines that i had are completely gone
i get lots of small red bumps on my cheeks where you contour
3 drops is too much
my fine lines are gone
rose hip oil is a very different thing.
if this were tinted
to those who complains about how this cream just sits on the face
has made the expression lines on my forehead less noticeable
lightened up my dark spots
putting a very light layer on my face
as some who otherwise turns red in 30 minutes
however leaves a white cast
or if you are dark skinned
the only down side to this product is that it leaves a white cast
first rub it in between my fingers
i pat under my eyes
i whipe downwards because if i rub it in
there is a slight white cast at first
it fades with time or under foundation
because i only use padding motions around delicate eye areas to blend in products
they won't look pasty white
even though it has a white tint because of the mineral base
looks a bit white at first
just a little dot on the cheeks
there is still a little bit of white cast after application
you won't get a white cast
it is a bit thick
can leave some white streaks on the face if i try to rush
i tend to breakout with oily bumps at the end of the day on my forehead
have had no trouble with the dreaded "white cast
the white cast disappears within minutes
especially compared to other masks i've used at lush
i even look a lot better on camera
it does tingle the skin the first few tries
leave all scars that take forever to fade
after the mask dried i could see little dark dots of oil the mask had pulled out over every pore
and my pores are nowhere near as huge at all.
it did tingle a little bit at first
1000% obsessed with this mask.
my scarring looked way more faded
flakey around my cheeks because i swim
often get breakouts on my chin area
that it burns a little bit
my skin was less red in cheeks
i've tried a lot of higher end masks
especially around my nose
it does tingle around my nose
so for the past year i've been having small little zits all over my upper cheeks
i've never seen a zit disappear from my face so fast in my life
the only down side of it would be it makes blackheads around nose appear darker
i literally saw white heads being brought to the surface guys
my face burned a little
saw this mask at a fraction of the price of the glam glow
my pores were smaller after the first time
my only complaint is that there are textured flakes that are part of this mask
this did tingle a little bit
in turn made my face a little red
once i washed the mask off my face was brighter
the dark areas in my pores dissapeared
big pores in the normal places
i knew it was a gray ish mud
after 2 mud masks my skin was already clearer
the bubbles could be a little more pronounced
really soft and no tightness.
my face is left slightly dry
my kids were always giggling whenever they look at my face with lots of bubbles
soft with a small amount of glow
one pump is plenty for face
i even apply a little to my lips
we each used the entire pod on face/neck/chest
felt like a baby's bottom
as thought i was trying to rub a giant blob of honey across my face
just a tiny bit left on my lower lash line
dark spots are diminished.
although be careful near the eye area.
awing over how good his skin looked the next day
i just accidentally spilled some of it into my favourite eye shadow
the pores on my nose are not as visible as they have been
just keep it out of your eyes!
3-5 drops patted on my face
more even in tone
around my mouth feeling more normal
i sometimes get scaly dry patches under my mouth
recently started breaking out along my jawline
dull skin that is just beginning to noticeably age
then follow with 2-3 drops of this product mixed with a few drops of tea tree oil
i tend to have more acnes around chins
rough red patches i had developed on my cheeks
no longer had a ruddy look
red bumps around my mouth
the red marks were faded
the bumps around my mouth were flattened
i think eve my pores shrank a little
spilling seems to be a bit of a theme.
all in all, a clumsy bottle with nice oil inside.
i keep looking at my face in the mirror
one of my favorite facial masks by far.
it was a little pink
my only problem zone is along my jawline
all of my rough patches were gone.
took the dark spots on my forehead completely gone
had super annoying patches of dead skin that looked awful under makeup
the dry patches looked
this unique mask had one of the most weirdest tingle sensations that bubbled on my face
one smile line on my left side
scaly with the winter weather
just a tiny dab goes a long way.
the jar has plenty of product
wake up with super soft
i didnt buy it to smooth this line i have on my forehead from all the silly faces i make
it smoothed my lines
this helped out my dry cheeks so much
have started to notice some fine lines on my forehead
it feels a little thick at first
so, my face has been having dry patches.
my dry patches are gone
i rub it in between my fingers
smoothed imperfections i'd struggled with for some time
fine lines especially the center of my forehead
the deep like sideway crinkles that kinda looked like loose skin is no more
as some spots on my face are dry
it caused me to breakout- especially on my forehead
use just a few dots.
i prefer wash off masks to peek off ones
left it looking bright
less often on my cheeks
definitely just put a thin layer on like the directions say
especially on my nose
literally all my blackheads on my nose were gone after the first use
i noticed my pores looking probably 50% smaller
my scars are less visible
i could tell my pores looked tighter, as well.
which are great traps for blackheads to get stuck in
my pores were noticeably smaller
often have black heads
masks like these leave my skin tight
it left an annoying spot on my nose
my skin is now leaning towards the normal side
turning it bright red
my magnifying mirror with led lights
nothing hides from that mirror
not only were my pores visibly way smaller "like 16 again small"
a little toward the oily side on my t-zone
chin that are quite small
"tight" into the skin
showing the dark spots!
need to see the "oil dots"
short of pore laser treatment my realistically bleak outlook underst
as this clay mask dried i was weirded out to see all these tiny dots around my nose which i realized were my pores
i feel tickling especially on the nose
i did notice some red areas
my pores had definitely decreased in size especially around my nose
on top of my cheeks where i noticed them the most
my skin feels tighter accross my nose
the dry patches were gone
it's oily in some spots
i can notice my blemishes fading away
it really draws out any pimples that i have cropping up to a head so they go away faster
i masked my forehead
in fact i suggest doing this mask before you even think about popping pimples to reduce scaring
little bumps under the skin
i always tend to get little tiny bumps on my cheeks
once i get my skin under control using the mask nightly
i went through a few days of severe dehydration where my face was so dry/tight i could barely smile
this mask fixed it pretty instantly
occasionally over an oil for a deep treatment
my fine lines are much softer.
the large pores in my oily t zone have noticeably diminished
i need 2-3 minutes of rubbing with water in my faces
it does brighten up the face though
the best part is my pores look visibly smaller!
just a warning with this mask
lighter since the mask is sucking out all sorts of stuff
some spots really dry
some spots really sensitive
i noticed a lot of blemishes coming to the surface
i noticed my pores were much tighter
several other face masks that are all too harsh on my skin
cheeks near my nose
i tried the origins charcoal mask for many months
my pores were noticeably smaller
any areas that look like the pores are enlarged or congested
rub in circles until its gone
dry patches be gone.
can often look lackluster
i wake up glowing
my dry patches are gone
neck areas because i shave daily
my neck is even regaining tone
i will end up with patches of flaky
work in unison perfectly
right away my skin looked plumped up with smoothed out lines
under my bottom lip
my face would *feel* tight
i still found my skin even drier than usual with scaly
red patches on my eyelids
the mask does seem to plump my face a bit
i find most "gel" masks to be kind of lack luster
wake up with bright
i usually wake up with heavy wrinkles under my eye area
i wake up to plump
like the other mask
the fine lines around my eyes were not visible
my naked skin was not splotchy
it requires some rubbing on the eyes
sometime i have to wipe a little harder on my eyes
i decided to dip my toes in the water with this product
while it states to keep away from eyes to avoid burning
teeny tiny red pumps
the directions say not to get it close to the eyes or eye area
carefully following the directions for making small circles of the cleasing oil over the eye area
no tugging to get my eye makeup off.
with just a little massaging into my face
mainly around my cheeks
some deep lines in my forehead are smoother
my only complaint is that it stings my eyes a bit
there's always small residue left around my eyes.
doesn't hurt my sensitive eyes
also looked like it broke down some dry skin flakes i had on my cheeks without exacerbating the dryness
such an notic oboe improvement in small under eye lines
this eye cream has helped overnight.
my eyes started to show aging
seems to tighten skin as well
my makeup is sitting on top of a sea of shine all over my face
but the fine lines and jowls were getting to me.
already has lighten up some hereditary darkness under the eyes
for about two years i had milia on my eyelid that made me feel like i always had to wear eyeliner to cover it
also helped with my dark circles
do not have deep crows feet
also i add the cream to my crows feet.
i needed an eye cream to help with sagging eye lids
fine lines under the eyes
bags under my eyes seem less
my dark circles are bad
a lot of eye creams are either too light or too thick
suddenly my eyes finally look smooth
have less little creases
the dark circles were much lighter
my under eye area no longer has those dreaded dark circles
no longer see bags under my eyes
started developing dark circles
1 month later my under eye area looks bright
not only does it reduce my eye circles from my poor circulation
i also noticed my entire eye lids firming up.
turned into an oil slick with breakouts all over
my face is way less red
my pores on and around my nose are less visible.
just draw a line on one of my dry cheeks
even with a face brush
the black heads on my nose are clear
nose strips are a joke
massage in slow circles
black heads galore on my nose
wipe some on my fingers to get some product for my face
spread on trouble areas
my pores are already a little smaller!
the sales girl recommended it for me because a bout with shingles left me with enlarged pores above my eyebrow her suggestions on changing the directions to use it on a dry face with dry fingers
a little around your nose
i preferred just using my fingers.
i follow up with both an eye cream
eventually i'd like to try a boscia eye cream
i notice my scars are fading
with no cap on to dry
he does have black heads
the second time he used it his pores were noticeably smaller
this stick certainly helps keep the unsightly black dots at bay
my black heads are going away
swipe it on my dry face
sometimes i have congestion on my nose
it kind of just smushed the actual product around
i used my finger instead to get a tiny amount
after washing with this they looked noticeably smaller
chin to a point where i flake
black heads on my nose
a few swipes across the brush
as i only need to target my nose
turn up the bottom knob just a bit
my neck had begun losing elasticity
comes out like a watery gel consistency which is slightly off-putting initially
moving from a very humid climate with mild winters
my face used to be dull
other than the occasional mask
i've noticed fine lines around my eyes diminished
had uneven tone all around with dark patches under my eyes
this is by far the best brightening mask out there making my skin finally one toned
this has done wonders lightening up small dark marks on my face
i gave it 4 stars because its such a small jar
it left me several dark marks along my chin
i sometimes get dark spots
surrounding my mouth area
some light spots near my smile area as well
sure my scars are less visible
was leaning towards the mud mask after a few samples
it tingles a little bit at first
while correcting dark spots
i am also getting fine lines on my forehead
it seemed to temporarily clear up the superficial little red marks of more recent breakouts
i scrub the darkest spots on my face
it's doing the same for my suns spots
my scars ruined my face
i still struggle w/ dark marks
ambi to remove my dark spots
some dark spots around my mouth
soft does help dark spots
it is a bit steep.
seen my dark spots fading
my main reason for purchasing it is to help fade dark spots
it helped a loooot with dark spots/scars.
i noticed some of the brown spots
after one use my face looked a little brighter
literally looks like you're glowing from within
lifeless middle aged skin
maybe enough for a dozen masks?
i love that this mask is kind of in between a clay mask
is a lot quicker than the 3-step ole henriksen brightening mask system
with quite a few freckles/dark spots
my under eye bags
dark spots are almost 60 percent lifted
therefore i have stubborn dark sports
has helped fade my dark spots
its very light on my face.
just bought this due to having darker pigmentation spots after i had my son
which turns dull with the slightest sun exposure
the backs of her arms to help with those little bumps some tend to get
they keep away those small bumps that tend to creep up my forearm
on my face they are great at removing dead skin
no more dry, rough, flakey patches.
they neutralize with my skin oddly
even the scar has faded
along with other scars
use the rough side all over my face
use the soft side to finish
cleanse my heavily makeup'd face straight up with these life savers
especially for people with congested
milia is practically gone
i get flaky occasionally
flaky patches on my lower cheeks/upper lip area have been more difficult to treat compared to oiliness on my t zone
they have a grainy and a soft side.
the grainy side is a bit rough.
i prefer the softer side.
fine lines are softer
they keep breakouts at bay
the other side rough to really scrub dirt off
i just glow after using it
erasing that dull hungover look
tiny bumps on my forehead
i swear my pores disappeared in front of my eyes
the really deep ones are relaxed.
looking in the mirror
neck did a big disappearing act
sagging on their face
under-skin bumps that i had on my chin
especially around my nose
even after i strayed away for some time to try out other masks my skin still seemed less textured
all the bumps are gone
my cheeks are always a little too flushed
along with many other masks
in fact love all of origins masks
have tried countless numbers of masks
my pores are always something i've struggled with
get a little bit painful
it did tingle a bit while it was on
i've tried many many masks
with lots of dry spots
helped clear up dry patches
this one made my little bumps go away
especially under my nose
below my eyes which used to be kinda rough
it tingles a little when on
i find that the origins rose clay mask is great for my skin
i struggle with blackheads around my chin as well as dry skin in my t zone
helped get rid of those minor little bumps on my forehead
it limits the movements of the face
as all of the little bumps
this mask definitely burned quite a bit while on
bumps on my chin
i own over 20 masks
i've always had my eye on guerlain products
it has a tendency to get shiny as the day goes
it got rid of my genetic dark spots almost instantly
break-out prone skin
crossing my fingers that this continues
love these little pods!
the blue algae mask is the best one in my opinion
all blemishes were almost completely gone
instantly makes my fine lines under my eyes less noticeable
so far i've tried the green tea
i've gotten 4 uses out of the green tea
since this is a face mask
bright after i put those
pearl masks for 4 days in a row
i've used the green tea mask four times now.
you wake up with plump
i always have small bumps on my face
the bumps surprisingly disappear
over the past year my skin started to get lots of little bumps under the skin
papules are little red bumps with no open pore
have woken up to plumper looking skin
i love these little pods!
shiner when i use it
plus the dark fatigue spots in the corners
the dark spots in the corners are completely gone
alternating with my usual one
they had 3 of these pods left
on days when my chin
i often have dark circles
look pale in the morning
always make my way back to the green tea mask
it's cuts down on the shiny appearance.
you have to rub your eyes a bit
it can leave eyes a little blurry
its more on the dry side
the cotton pad was still white
the cotton pad was still white as heck
long wearing lip colors
beats the expensive ones hands down!
the rest of my face with the magic eraser
it still spreads well
i rub it over my eyes even though i have sensitive eyes
it made my face very bumpy
it does make my contacts a little blurry if it gets in my eye
it has made all the lines under my eyes disappear
i struggle with fine dry lines
however it didn't reduce dark circles
especially the wrinkle between my eyebrows
no more under eye darkness
i do feel that the dark spots
fine lines under my eyes
my eye area has always been rather dry.
so far my under eyes seem smoother
subtracted a star because it didn't help my dark circles
mpressed with the ultimune eye concentrate
all of the little lines around my eyes were gone
in regards to people saying it stings their eyes
it's a great pair with origins ginzing eye cream in the morning
smooth out fine lines under my eyes
helped my dark undereye circles with just one use
must buy if you have dullness or dark circle / dark spots issues
there are fewer dehydration lines under my eyes now
i am seeing a really big difference in the darkness under my eyes
this mask takes away all my scars
no joke lightened my dark circles
put it on my eye lids too
i cannot speak to brightening or lessening of the age/dark spots of which i have a few tiny ones
my right cheek is a lot worse
it still brightened my whole face even under my eyes
the other high end products barely made my scars lighter
this is the best brightening mask i have tried
the kind of glow that looks like it's coming from inside out
i slap the creamy mask on for fifteen minutes
the area around my mouth was probably the worst as far as sagging
fine lines around my mouth
i can also see the effects around my jaw line.
the area around my nose
mouth are definitely not as droopy once i apply this
my face stayed taut
use index/middle finger to spot all on areas of face
with dry patches that were larger
although i had predominantly dry skin
a little bit of the all about eyes rich cream
no more dry patches.
the little non-age lines especially prominent
crinkles around my eyes
i really like this eye cream it tight the eye area feels fresh
this is the best eye cream i've ever used for my dark circles
it decreased my white heads
i still get some shiny areas on my face
also use on my neck.
eye cream at bed time to smooth out all these winkles i've suddenly acquired
clear up my dry patches in 2 weeks
1 min on my smile lines
the there are not some many wrinkles on her face
the whole area around my eyes look brighter
having surgery facedown caused damage around my eyes
i've never had crows feet
i noticed that its difficult to glide
do small circles on bare skin
after the 1st week i definitely noticed my crows feet are less deep
fine lines under my eyes
the eye are is red after treatment
my eyes didn't even tear up
the tip top of my cheekbones got really red the first night
is not even close to being unbearable
the sun spots are disappearing
they are now in a semicircle under my eyes
swollen the next day
my dents seem less deep
i also use it around my lips
it has really decreased the small lines around my mouth
my eyes already look better
i am starting to see some fine lines around my eyes
those little 11 lines between my brows are starting to form
yes the laser hurts a bit
i also use it on the nose area
some under eye bags
my under eyes are also brighter now
my dark circles weren't that bad to begin with though
i am pale so the darkness made it look like i had two black eyes
after 4 weeks using the tria the hollows under my eyes are starting to fill in
it feels like you're snapping your skin or getting a tiny shock
the tiny lines i started to notice cropping up
my dark circles are gone
my fine lines are disappearing
this really rejuvenated my under eye area
the fine lines are gone
dark circles since that's not one of the claims
even diminished the dark circles
more like a slight sunburn that quickly faded away for me
it did sting a bit
the skin around my eyes appeared younger
sticking to my dry spots
no longer have issues with dry spots
my overly expressive eyebrows have caused me to have visible wrinkles on the forehead already
since i have been using it my cheeks have been noticeably less pink
i would dot my foundation on my face
my creases are insane
my lower cheeks are a lot more dry than the rest of my face
i add a tiny bit into my foundation
it has totally transformed my skin from a dry red mess to glowing
i often ended up with a red blotchy mess on my face
in a matter of 15 minutes the red mess on my face magically disappear
tend to get dry around my hairline
my skin sometimes felt almost grainy like my nose
red patches were gone
my face has never been more soft or glowing.
my skin was a bit red after a mask
it just looked too light while my neck
seems to have brightened it up a bit
this stuff must have fairy dust in it.
i started to see some lines under my eyes
so this eye cream had some pretty huge claims
my lines are less visible
the dark circles i have , diminished.
i recently started to get under eye creasing when i wore foundation
the eye cream was one of them
the line seem to fade
the creases are less deep
as far as my eyes
truly just writing this review because of how unnoticeable my pores looked on my nose earlier
my dark spots are noticbly lighter
i dab on a little in areas of my face
my face is pretty much pore less!!
sometimes my cheeks as well
there are a couple of places where it has a slight stinging sensation
it has helped my dry patches considerably
just tap a few times with clean fingers
i've noticed a tingling in the dry areas
breakouts on my chin almost at all times
my pores on my forehead are large enough to bother me
i also get the occasional breakout
my tiny bumps on my jawline are gone!!
soft feeling that persisted even after washing with clairsonic
great for under your eyes
helps with my undereye circles as well
it has considerably reduced my red spot
even while i avoided the sun
yet with white tiny spots on my forehead
those superrr annoying little tiny bumps
i love how the balm has a bounce to it
kept breakouts at bay
bumps receded in less than a week
a little bit around the nose
that night when i washed my face i noticed i had small bumps all over my face
causing these little raised bumps
light on the face
there is still a lil tingling sensation when applied
it's like my pores have been blurred.
#cheap but a girl does not need puffy eyes!
nothing has helped the big puffy under my right eye
this works faster than any eye cream i've tried on those puffs
definitely my go to eye cream now.
on mornings when my eyes are really puffy this stuff is a lifesaver
as with any eye cream
my under-eye area is much more supple since using it
very few fine lines
thankfully i don't have any deep crowsfeet or eye wrinkles
this is quite effective on the tiny wrinkles that surrounded my undereye area
my under eye area has gotten darker
just starting to get lines at the corners of my eyes
work full time so tend to get puffy under the eyes pretty regularly
especially under the eyes
the fine lines under my eyes are gone
i mean tiniest bit
it will not take away your dark circles
cause some creasing or difficult texture as some have complained of
saw underneath my eyes
sunken area under eye above cheeks looks much better
face esp around my eyes
my under eyes have been transformed.
firm that under eye area
the lines are less visible
i got this to help with dark circles
i always have dark circles in the morning
i wake up with puffy eyes
over time it has helped with my dark circles.
crows feet since my 20's
i paused with my ginseng eye brightening cream to use this for a few days
this does not help with brightening or concealing any dark circles
the skin around my eyes is not puffy or wrinkly
my dark circles have lightened up a tiny bit.
my wrinkles are getting better at disappearing
i finally found an eye cream i like
light back to my eyes
some loss of firmness on my upper eyelids
there was a visible lift to my lids
this time of year my eyes get all puffy
nothing seemed to touch my dark circles

wake up with little bumbs on my forehead this helps clear my skin up nicely
i like the quick mask
the pink one everywhere else

the pads are huge
chest area with just one pad
wrinkle fighting pads are out there
have focused on the area between my eyes where i have a tough

if i press pad into skin in problem areas i can definitely see wrinkles plump up in few minutes
the pads are large enough
these pads seem to really be softening the lines around my eyes

blue moon plus the ufo oil has banished his clogged pores on his forehead
it also irritated my eyes.
like the directions say
i particularly enjoy taking time nightly massaging this into my skin
focus on my eyes
i'll rub this all over my eyes
covering the entire face steeped in a warm cloth for a few seconds or longer
plumps my fine lines around my lip area.
s to soften it up some more
except around the eyes i found it stung
i sometimes get a little red
also saw the tip on their instagram to use as a lip balm
i switched to blue moon
my issue is with dark circles under my eye.
especially with winter approaching
blue moon is far better
even around my eyes!
sagging chin are greatly improved as well
i don't notice a difference in wrinkles or dark circles
i notice my eyes are not as puffy anymore
my dark circles have diminished
it doesn't irritate my eyes
especially around the delicate eye area
as if it had a slight vanilla twinge to it
the jar is a little on the thrifty side -- a glass jar would have been nicer --
the logo was slightly scratched off
the little gold flecks really light up the skin!
i put it on and rub it in with my fingers.
my skin returns to patchy dry areas
dark patches around mouth
you're barely showing signs of aging
woke up with noticeably softer
i wake up with bright, awake looking skin.
kept all of the flakes away
the skin around my eyes wasn't so dark
side note- it works really well on sun-burned skin
