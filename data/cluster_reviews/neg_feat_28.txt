then i noticed the cheeks became dry while the t-zone was stilly oily
looking at the picture
balled up in spots
especially around my jaw
i also feel like this tones down the redness around my nose
it also felt heavy.
it felt like itchy play doh on my face.
tery cream that left my sky feeling oily
i would be left with a bluish/purplish tinge on certain parts of my face where i apparently didn't rub it in enough
i sometimes get irritated
it just sits there, thick and will not absorb.
a quick rundown of my skin
my eyes were puffy
my eyelids are pretty loose because i've been using double lid tapes too much
i did a patch test on my left cheek
third time i used it i started to notice some texture forming around my lower jaw
dead skin patches weren't peeled at all
even though the dead skin
there's a weird satisfaction in pulling masks off of your face
it stings a little when first applied.
my skin was bright red wherever the mask had touched my skin
it does calm irritated my face
however, there are dry patches on my face.
i want a product for dark circles
then i started noticing that my cheeks were more bumpy than usual
it remained as a sticky
tacky layer on the top of my skin that could be kind of peeled/ pulled off
totally left bumps all over my face
i noticed my cheeks started to get red
any little red dry patches on my face are gone
it just sits on top of the skin even overnight
even the shape should be altered to more of a rounded oval than a big rectangle block
weighing the pay-off of that with the tackiness is leaves on my skin
it's made me break out in all the spots except the crows lines
without visibly reducing fine lines
have a faint line developing on my forehead
the ball tip is nice for "massaging" around the eyes however
it does not brighten the eye area as it claims
i don't deal with dark under eye circles or puffy eyelids
it continued to happen under both of my eye lids
therefore exaggerates my dark circles
my under eye area got darker after using this
there are better and cheaper eye creams out there
i don't have heavy dark circles under my eyes
this product makes it look like i have a black eye
doesn't depuff or help with dark circles.
notice my fine lines were deeper
left me eye area bright
still had bags, still looked puffy.
i got this in the summer hoping to fix my seriously dark circles around my eyes
it's an average eye cream.
other times it felt slightly cooling
this is a great eye cream to get young people into using an eye cream
in fact, it made my under eye area very dry.
my under eye area felt dry
when l would look in the mirror
every fine line was exaggerated
as opposed to thicker ones
occasionally need something for tired eyes
the all about eyes
it didn't sting my eye or caused sensitivity
i don't have many options to a variety of eye creams since i don't like spending over $40 on an eye cream
dark under eyes totally disappearing
the skin below has become even more delicate
rolls of i try to spread it too much i like the ageless eye cream from tatcha much better
my face went back to it's normal level of oiliness
my skin under my eye was bumpy
on cracked skin it is good
this cream leaves my eye area even more wrinkle!
the pads are a joke.
bonus: i somehow ended up with more puffiness rather than less
the pads sometimes stayed on well
even makes my eyes look more tired!
those pads were huge on me
way more than the undereye area where the cream went
i really wanted this product to work to tighten the lower eye lid area
no refreshed under eye
de-puffed around my eyes
could it be because i have little plumper cheeks?
it goes on blotchy and patchy.
i tend to push my face into the pillow
this product made the lines look deeper
with little to no wrinkles other than a "1" versus an "11" between my brows
brow in years past
that pesky line between my eyes
i only have a few wrinkles near my lips on the left side of my face
the wrinkles i am fighting are only on the left side of my face
as a mask, should i use it as a sleeping mask???
sometimes looking a little worse
after it has been on your face for a few minutes it turns ashy
got a decent sized sample was using religiously on frown line
for minor under eye alittle goes a long way
in fact i've noticed some new tiny blemishes in places i don't usually have them
i could barely spread it over my face because the second i spread it over one cheek i could already feel it clogging my pores
in fact i have darker bags under my eyes
begining to see lines on my forehead
especially in my dark circles
this caused the skin around my eyes to sting a little upon application
my eyes look terrible!
i am 28 years old with some fine lines on my forehead
the dark circles under my eyes are starting to become less noticeable
it's worked so well to clear up the blackheads i've had on my chin forever
after a month i noticed in a magnifying mirror basically every pore seemed clogged
my skin was the same level of congested
ie black heads on nose
it seemed to be way too thick
i found mainly reviews for the mud mask
patchy around my mouth
my black heads have increases
left imprints around patches
the eye patch was uncomfortable enough that it affected my sleep
exchanged for the 24 karat eye patches
i woke up with really puffy eyes
my fine lines seemed to have disappeared in the puffiness of my skin
as well as warming it up a bit
did leave my under-eyes smooth
taut in the morning
the patches left giant creases around my eyes
've taken to tapping it on my fingers then patting on my eyes
the patches were small
they left an imprint outline under my eyes for hours
even the eye patches are worthless
my eyes would be puffy
pull off in little tiny balls
i've gotten more blemishes on my face
just plain old putting it on my bare
had uneven patches in others
it pilled on my face
the rubbing of it made it worse
i got dry spots on my upper lip and cheek.
it broke my face out with tiny little bumps all over
it just feels like rubbing big rocks on your face
the grain size in this mask is really harsh
the sugar is so sharp.
as a mask i give this 5 stars.
especially through the chillier months
after a few days of daily use it left my cheeks dry
it's a bit rough on the eye area
being such a large bottle with a flip top/bottom
there are drugstore masks way better.
i felt a little tingling sensation around my mouth when applied
i try a lot of face masks
decided to use it since my pores have been a little more clogged than usual
to the point my eyes watered a little
made my skin break out into little bumps
i also am fairly pale.
just used it as a eye shadow base which did work well
my breakouts weren't as calmed/shortened as with luna
sits on top of the skin
it also didn't brighten or soften or reduce fine lines
break up all over my cheeks
they're still a few bumpy patches on my face
i now have a noticeable black head beside my nose
my lips felt gross
i used it on my elbows hoping it soften them up some
eye makeup all shifted
it left me with dry patches that were red
used it on other dried areas like my knees
when i war this it made my forehead break out however it made my cheeks
as well i have noticed some acne spots popping up on the areas i applied the balm on
i still get dry areas around the corners of my eyes
even worse than the tight feeling in my face was the dry white spots that appeared on my face after an hour of applying
it burned the skin around my eyes when i used it to make my eyes less puffy
if your face is really puffy in the morning
the stick is wide and clunky.
hard to apply around your eyes or nose
cons: large surface area= horrible for getting around your under eyes
i could only use it at night to avoid a shiny forehead
sometimes on my cheeks
leaves a light film on top of my face
and also i love most of origin's face mask.
other times it's just the chin
while it did help my mask spread slightly easier
especially around the eye area
as someone that suffers from periodic dry patches
it also made my dry patches appear
my face looked like the sahara desert
this product stings the eyes if i get too close.
there were still some remnants of face make up left over as well as my eye make up
as if felt like rubbing jelly all over my face
there are tiny bumps all over my face my face is not smooth anymore
i still had the same issues with itchy, dry eyes!
cause me to breakout in little bitty bumps on my forehead
i only use a few drops
it made me break out in these little weird small pimples on my chin
i still saw dry patches in my skin
it stung my eyes so bad.
it did lighten my dark circles however the step 2 turned into a weird waxy consistency after a while
then applied to my crows feet
the "radiance" part translates into a slick-looking face after a few hours
this made my cheeks so much worse that it turned flakey
the moment i applied it to my face i got this uncomfortable stinging sensation
makes them super red
blotchy with red dots
woke up with bumps
when i put on my foundation it is super patchy
clung on to dry patches
dry patches on my face
sometimes it stings on the dry patches of my cheeks
the moisturizer gave me little bumps around my jaw line
this made my combination leaning towards oily skin straight up dry
i hate having to dip my fingers into it
i started getting dry patches
i get tiny little bumps on my forehead
i really thought this would work on my puffy eyes
it actually made them more puffy
it also stretches your skin
it just didn't work to reduce my dark circles.
but not dark circles.
it was way too thick
it also made me breakout with tiny bumps all over my cheeks
helped with the dry skin especially around the chin area
perhaps my pores are a bit smaller
i used these eye patches everyday until i ran out
they wouldn't make my eye circles disappear
the patches themselves have a weird shape
under my eye was dry as a bone!
there was plumping under my eyes
didnt help any of the wrinkles or the deep circles
my eyes felt cool while patches were on my under eyes
maybe softer under eyes
s eye masks which are 6 dollars a pop
a size of a rice is enough to cover the whole orbital of my eyes
my dark circles started to disappear.
then underneath my eyes
the eye cream is a definite let down
i'd rather have under-eyes on the drier side than chunks of concealer missing from under my eyes
the 2 3 lines i have under my eyes
the fuss over this mask
this mask is unremarkable, in my opinion.
the black heads i get from the californian heat seem even more apparent now
i barely notice a difference in my dark spots.
i notice the dark spots more
this product did not work at fading dark spots.
if i used the product on larger areas of my skin small bumps would appear
not tiny bumps like others said they got
more large whiteheads appeared in the morning
bumps every where i used it
walking around with breakouts to find out
it cause bumps everywhere i put it
dozens of bumps in the areas i used it
of sleeping mask is so much nicer
this mask left small red bumps on my cheeks
flaky in the winter/spring
made my face sting.
glow side by side
the after effect of the moisurizer just looks like i have cheap glitters sprinkled all over my face
i swiped it on my cheeks as a highlighter for a nice finish
as the directions weren't too clear
even a step darker perhaps
is way too dark for a bare nude for my skin tone
loved the pore vanishing stick
i do use the flip cap highlight on my cheekbones
definitely not for pale people.
i used this as a body glow on my legs
use only a little across your cheeks
bedazzled, glitter bombed faces...
the sun screen seemed to be the major problem.
my face was white
i've gone through this rather quickly compared to other eye creams i've used
dry under eye area with fine lines
has little flakes of something in it
i used this on my forehead
it gave my forehead red spots
my always clear forehead
also noticed it really set into your creases
tiny superficial pimples that crop up right away when something new is breaking me out
every time i used it, i got a huge pimple
caused my lm to just kind of sit on top of skin
it sits on my face
my eyes looked tired and my wrinkles looked deep.
which is slightly on the dry side
fine lines around my eyes
especially around my nose
woke up with very smooth skin though.
as well as in-between my eyebrows
it seemed to dry my cheeks out as well.
oily zones- no problem at all
it just lingers around
skin has been flaring up around the eyes
my whole face broke out into little white bumps
except for a feeling of tightening
no benefits to the skin around the eye
this just tightens under your eye for a while
my eyes looked the same.
i already have crepe like skin under my eyes
my skin is past that stage
i extend it down on my decollete
it left gold glitter in my face
it also has fake little gold shimmer bits in it.
got bumps on certain parts of of my face since using this product
in fact a highly heavy sent which fades pretty fast
except for around my nose
the thought of sleeping with glitter on my face during the rejuvenating/healing time is unsettling
with glitter all over
i always have to lean it downwards towards the sink
the bumps got bigger
sometimes persisting through winter
this is last years anastasia mini brow pencil
that had an empty brow pencil
mascara was more of a blue than black.
it looks dark then really light with one swipe
or alleviate dark circles
the eye liner feels a little cheap
didn't help with black under the eyes
my skin looks red and almost irritated.
tingles a bit when i put it on
after two days of use i noticed little bumps appearing all over my face as well as pimples
i also developed little white bumps under my bottom lip
the corner of my eyes
like baby butt smooth.
this will leave a shiny
it did not lighten dark spots.
i went for eyebrow threading
my forehead looked plump
it has some fine lines
my face also appeared brighter.
after several days of using it i started to notice tiny little pimples starting to form on my forehead
after about a week i started noticing little bumps on my chin
cause tiny little bumps all over my forehead
my dry spots remained
my forehead appeared shiny
i still had some dry spots
the peeling has become too much
i now have tons of tiny bumps
particularly around my eyes
aside from the bumps
i noticed that my cheeks
forehead started to have many needle tiny bumps
thought it was okay, like the blue jar much more.
deep rooted breakouts that i hadn't been having
different folks different strokes
eyes sting pretty badly
after about two weeks of use i found that my face was becoming more splotchy
it wreaked havoc on my skin
i woke up with dry patches all over my face
so sad i've been on a prowl for a good day serum
i end up getting a pig underground pimple within 24 hours
my eyes look more crepy than before
my eyes are actually more creepy and seem drier.
i struggle with darkness under my eyes.
it didn't irritate my eyes though.
it actually kinda stung around my nose/lip area.
when my skin was parched
unlike other sleeping masks
both times i used it my face felt noticeably dry
while i don't mind a tingle
irritation around eye/nose areas
around my delicate eye area
avoiding my eye area
my face was red
within a couple hours my forehead was a shiny
this did nothing for my eyelids.
things are loosening up
my eyelids aren't good enough, now?
i read the reviews on how it lifts the eyelid area
after a few days my skin on face felt irritated
left them a little crusty
fragile under eye area
i liked the cooling effect it has underneath my eyes
i literally felt i was putting on lip balm under my eye
dragged the skin beneath my eyes
it honestly felt like i was putting lip balm around my eyes
even if i wake up without blotchy
irritated skin around my eyes i'd never pay full price for this product
i noticed a few hours after my first try my eyes weren't so puffy which is great
for the past month it hasn't done anything for reducing my puffy under eye bags
it moistures the under eye area and feels nice.
sensitivity above my cheekbone
i don't see a huge improvement in the puffiness or the dark circles i have
not the best i have tried for puffy eyes
that said my eyes are still pretty puffy.
doesn't reduce my dark circles
does nothing as far as getting rid of puffiness/dark circles
my tired puffy eyes
things #1 i'm getting worse lines in my face
#2 this one is gut wrenching even though i'm a two time over rouge this year
my skin actually gets more congested
it is like brick chalk
goes patchy over this
mostly just looks glittery on your face.
really emphasized some dry patches i can have towards the perimeter of my face
this stuck to my dry patches
advertised them like a neon sign
this particular product made the skin around my eyes appear thinner thus making my dark circles worse
saw some dark spots on my forehead from the summer sun
haven`t noticed a difference with dark spots
it's very heavily fragranced just to warn sensitive noses
after using this cream it has smoothed those lines out
there is a little bit of a tightening feeling when i have worn it
i still felt like my forehead
i will say that on my cheeks
it remained sticky even when i used less
pores in the t-zone were visible
felt nothing close to a "corset" tightening
i feel a tightening sensation
so i gave tundra chaga a shot.
smeared it all over my t-zone
trying to use these blot drops to blot made my foundation patchy
when i put it over foundation it made it splotchy
look in the mirror
especially when the light hits it
my face stay shiny all over
didn't help with my age spots
it made my dark circles even worse
which increases the look of dark circles
my under eyes are dry
protect my eye area
i've also noticed if it gets too close to my eyes it gets in my contacts
it did nothing to my dark circles.
merely sits on top of the skin
by morning, there's still residue under my eyes.
the next day my under eyes were extremely dry
it has done nothing for my dark circles
or dry eye area
tingled a bit when i put it on
there are better eye serums out there
with small spots on my forehead
it was too thick to sink into my skin despite using a tiny amount
i looking in the mirror
patches were visible through my foundation
made my foundation patchy
for my face especially
just hovers on top
left skin patchy wherever it wore off
dark under eye circles
applied it to a bare face only on the high points like you would a highlighter
the half moon around the eyes etc
lasted that day when i removed it my face was bright red flaming hot irritating
for it to give me the a thin coverage veil
especially around the hairline where i sweat a little
with just a tiny bit of this
i'll be stretching out my tiny little sample from play
i usually stay away from all illuminators as they seem to accentuate large pores
in general i like this eye cream
the start of droopy eyelids
i started getting red bumps all over my skin
my pores have opened up more/become larger
beware it is literally jet black
i think it was causing texture issues on my chin
get patchy in some areas of my face
it might have blurred
it did blur out my pores a little near my nose
just crumpled my makeup up
it seems to make other products pill like a sweater in the region of my temples
my face was an oil slick
maybe it's better suited for ashy ankles
it made my makeup patchy around my nose
this did blur/mattify my skin when i used it
all about eyes eye cream
especially across my cheeks
it made everything else on my face splotchy
all of the dryness was front and center.
it is so thick
my "imperfections" have yet to be blurred.
does not cover dark circles
it did not live up to the fascinating description of "diamond dust
i ended up with more small white bumps on my chin
ended up with clusters of bumps
little white bumps on my cheeks as well
although it fades pretty quickly
mainly on my chin
first of all this has a very thick
i occasionally will get a pimple somewhere on my t zone
especially on my chin
jaw line which is rare for me
i also found it a little too tacky compared to my other nighttime face products
whenever i get breakouts it is always on my cheeks
however after using this for 3 days my forehead it covered in little tiny bumps
it's a very thick formula that just sat on top of my skin all night
basically it just looks like a rubbed a ton of body glitter all over my face
way too much glitter in this product.
only by adding a bunch of gold glitter on your face
but i found this product streaky and sticky.
found several spots of streaks that i missed during my application
those tiny little bumps that you can barely see unless it's in the light
this left the weirdest texture on my face.
it remained really sticky/tacky in the oiliest spots on my face
made my face stiff
there are gold flakes
mostly oily in the summer
my skin is noticeably more congested
my pillow case stuck to my face
each time i've ended up with a huge red itchy blotch
my face was immediately shiny
did nothing for my spots or dark areas.
my eyes became watery right after i applied it
made my face a little red after peeling off
it was difficult to apply with fingers.
putting this mask on was like huffing rubbing alcohol
between the watery eyes
my eyes were watering as i was applying it on to my face
it went on fairly evenly
smooth though at least
even like the boscia black mask
it just kept peeling only small bits
it literally made my eyes water
it irritated it more even.
the look of the orange was cool but that was it.
it left my skin so red
no peeling at all.
slap it on your face
my face now is dried completely out, red and raw.
the liquid's fume irritated my eyes
since i have a few other masks from origins
especially when you're applying around the nose area
the second day i started to notice bumps on my cheeks
it stung my eyes
i felt like it left a layer of oil sitting on top of my skin
so have to top it up with a face powder!
puffy under eye bags
my under eye bags have been really bad
when we're smearing their product right around our noses???
still got white heads
my face remained shiny
now i have a breakout on my forehead
it smeared make-up all over my face
every time i wear it i get small pimples/bumps dotting around my face
after 2 months i only noticed it smoothed out some of my forehead lines
my skin began to tingle almost immediately
stung a little bit if i had an extra dry spot
my face is covered in little bumps
especially along the jaw
this is spot i rarely breakout
it also left my face shiny all day.
my neck had two red welts
flakes in few areas
next day i noticed many red spots all over my face
flaky in some of my problem areas
shine in the hot months
it dried up my already dry patches on my face
i got very sunburned even though i covered my face well with it
the formula stings the eyes
a bit of a rare miss for lancôme
instead it was a very thick
my skin cleared up considerably
not to mention the glow it leaves behind is extremely ugly
it sits like a sticky film on top of your face
it seemed to be the flakiest in the areas that were more luminous than others
2nd it has an intense pink sheen to it like i had put highlighter all over my face it was horrible
looked in the mirror
it looked like i had dipped my whole face in holographic highlighter
puffy eyes or dark circles
on the bright side
i only wanted it for my dark spots/scars from the breakouts i do get occasionally
more often i was starting to get little bursts of acne coming out around my cheeks
with more scars then before
the next day i got one abnormally large pimple in a place where i never typically would break out
such as my contour/lower jaw area
literally only use this if you're nose blind.
after using this i got extremely red across my cheeks
the bridge of my nose
all the nasty little fruit chunks
hairline all day even though i don't put it anywhere near them
it left the face soft
it's kind of gross with the orange chunks on your skin
it left my skin kind of red,also.
chunky mess all over my face
it is sticky and the chunks are the worst.
my face became sticky
i really disliked having chunks of fruit on my face
my skin turned red
the large chunks of fruit in this mask make it unpleasant
oranges all over my face
it was absolutely no different from smearing marmalade across my face
the smell from opening this up is like peeling open an orange
only apply it to the dark spots on my skin
it worked so well on dark spots
i don't like the fact that it looked like i smeared a gold highlighter on my entire face
made me sneeze and irritated my eyes.
when i get overheated in an area with poor air circulation
not end up with red eyes
everything that claims to "illuminate" the face since i love having glowing skin
it seems to just fade into my skin
this is the scariest eye cream i've ever used
this eye cream will end up looking like you have poorly under-eye concealer: it is a pale pink
it felt like i was using shiny glue under my eyes
about halfway through my day i noticed it started crusting up around the outside of my eyes
it looked like i put highlighter on my eyes.
if you're looking to put aide a brightening mask
i love the black mask
it dried my skin out more than black
have used the black mask may times
it made my whole face red
maybe it removed some of my dead skin
i notice it helped with my flaky dry eyes
finer than in a micro-glitter eye shadow
while some may like this "lit from within" type of shimmer
i began seeing lines underneath my eyes that i haven't seen before
on the third day i developed a very red burning patch on one cheek
that was too much for my forehead
right now more on the oily side
red irritated skin that felt like it was burnt
i got so many small bumps the next day
especially with dry patches
trickled in my eyes
flaky in the winter
it was beyond uncomfortable
my face is red
i already have red spots on my face
the warming / burning was very uncomfortable
while the mask was on i thought my skin was burning from the mask irritation
so applied it on the spot throughout the day -- the pimple turned into a weird under-the-skin bump
the it also balled up under my fingers
it has faded slightly very slightly
i think it gave me a big red zit on the side of my cheek
biggest pet peeve is the heavy oily residue it left behind
brows the thing is when u pull out all the grey area with magnet
it was very difficult to spread a thin layer on my face
end up thick or patchy or not on at all
causing a giant frustrating mess
you get a really small magnet
to help my dry areas around my chin
leaving large bare spots
i woke up with scaly skin on my cheeks
some on my chin
normally i have a majorly oily forehead while the rest of my face is combination
causing my forehead to be even more oily than normal
i started noticing my pores becoming increasingly more clogged
especially on my nose
it wasn't until the third day that i noticed my skin revealing dry patches
my pores were slightly clearer after use
within 10-15 mins my combination skin cheeks were back to being dry-ish
it felt ok on my forehead
i washed my face with my clarisonic as per norm
i noticed that on my oily areas this worked beautifully
i felt a tightening sensation
just cover little bits of my red spots
it did not make my red cheeks disappear at all.
it is so thick
they all look chalky on my face.
even with its light feel
so trying to blend it into my neckline is a nightmare
will not cover any of my red acnes or dark sports
which made my face way too pale
this product is for the people who have pale skin
it's straight up oompa loompa orange on me.
it just made me orange
it makes more sense that green would color correct red better than orange anyway
by lunchtime my red spots are completely visible.
this product was about 5 shades too dark for me
it is too dark
it just was still too dark
i don't have dark skin
worked great under hourglass primer for added dewey effect
next my eyes are always foggy after i use this.
all around my chin area on both sides of the face
made my foundation patchy
it left a white cast on my face
i also this made my skin freak out on my forehead
i feel that this primer looked like a white film all over my face
the one i received was really watery
after seeing glowing reviews
this product did not blur or camouflage them at all
it was like rubbing in a white sunscreen that left white all over the skin
it actually seemed to exaggerate some lines
it clung to dry patches on my face
after this bunched up in dry areas
did not see a difference with fine lines or dark circles
no help with my dark circles
i rarely get my eyes puffy
how surprised i was to wake up with puffy eyes
i don't have dry eyelids or under eyes
was very excited to try it as i have perpetual dark circles under my eyes
i noticed the skin under my eyes is much whiter than it used to be
the dark circles are still there
no help for fine lines or dark circles at all :(
my under eye area got flakey
at first it was okay with a slight tingling sensation that made it feel like it was depicting my eyes
this does absolutely nothing for dark circles or fine lines
it did not brighten my eye area.
really didn't help dark circles
no visible results other than helping to cover dark circles
my dark circles looking even darker
can't speak much about the dark circles as i've had a rough month
my makeup was patchy
didn't do anything for fine lines or the under eye darkness
beware: this product goes from fresh to stale at lightning speed
it's definitely made my developing dark circles worse
darker circles than before use
it totally made my eyelid
i couldn't even wear makeup under my eyes because it just clung to my dry patches
i switched to this eye cream from the fresh black tea eye cream because the fresh one is very expensive
my barely-there dark circles got very bad
dark circles are normal at my age
i don't have puffy eyes or dark circles
it gave me dry red patches all around my eyes that burned
hasn't changed dark circles
definitely seeing a brightening under my eyes
it dried my eyes so bad.
i felt like it dried my eye area
flakiness under my eyes
my lines appeared less visible when i wore this
my skin has been breaking out on my cheeks
i never break out on my cheeks or forehead.
after a few uses it became too thick
i've tried patting on a very small amount avoiding my t-zones
after a couple days i noticed more red spots of clogged pores appearing
it is so thick
while also giving me small red breakouts all over my face
caused me to breakout along my nose creases
my cheeks are covered in bumpy
although it is thick
the cream had a white cast to it
clung to my dry patches
especially on my nose
i looked like i was sweating profusely
the only thing is that the beige it a little to light for me
it only barely covers my uneven areas
just a tiny amount was really thick
it was so pale
too white for me
matches my skin well
the whole entire time during those 3 months i've had tiny little bumps on my cheek
my tarte lights camera flashes mascara was still on
didn't burn my eyes
making it difficult to spread without tugging at the gentle skin around my eyes
if it gets closer to my nose
i've tried warming it with my fingers
broke me out in tiny white zits all over face it was so bad
woke up with no visible pores
my pores are more visible i used it for a week straight
reduce a very faint fine line
the only thing i enjoyed was rubbing the applicator tip around my eyes
it definitely didn't brighten my under eye area
it comes in a pink liquid with clear that sits at the top
starting to get fine wrinkles around my eyes
it also left a burning sensation.
the skin around my undereyes
the oil lingers around my eye
nose areas even after rising off with water a few times
then it just kind of smeared it around
streaked around my eyes
this stuff had a thick consistency
i looked so pale afterwards due to the white cast this left on my face
while i was rubbing this in
this made my dry spots look worse
definitely noticed a white cast
noticed by face was super shiny
looked like i was sweating.
ended up with a white mask that was very difficult to blend into my skin
i still have scars from my breakout
this makes my face red
spread it all over til a slight white cast was left
nothing only uneven skin
a bad break out on my forehead which is extremely unusual for me
ok the bright side
the appearance is a bit off
t just hangs out on the edge of my sink
almost too "squeaky clean"
the oil got everywhere
i am battling two massive blemishes
it was still too watery
however it did nothing for my fine lines or dark circles
dark shade under eyes
my eye area doesn't look better
my upper eye skin looks crepey
appears to have "more" creasing in my under eye area
i also had a few issues with bumps under my eyes while using this stuff
noticed i had dry flaky skin in the creases under my eyes
my fine lines had turned to creases
this cream gave me bumps around my eye area
cracked spot on the corner of my nose
then you have clumps of sparkle on your face in certain spots
looked in my car mirror i looked so shiny
my whole face was glittery
on its own it looked like i rubbed one of those frosty lip glosses from the 90's all over my face
maybe for a young girl with invisible pores
there is in practically every highlighter these days
the sparkles were covert operatives
the glitter was extreme
not at all glittery
this has straight up glitter in it
i ended up looking sort of metallic
there was glitter al over my face.
even woke up the next morning feeling like my face had a weird sheen to it
there was too much glitter
it was actually packed with glitter
plus i'm more yellow toned
it's like a unicorn sneezed on my face!
there was so much glitter!!
patted the excess product on my forearms because the amount of product in the sample was a bit too much for just the face
masking my face tonight in hopes of eradicating all the glitter
this made my face look like a giant snow globe.
there was glitter everywhere
until i went into some harsher light-its not sheen
i still have glitter everywhere the next day
not only is it straight up glitter
it seemed like after it dried it went from a cute sheen to a claire's glitter explosion on my face
also like to apply just a minimal amount after concealer under eyes with ring finger
had to rub it in vigorously to make it not look sparkly white
dewy from farther away
up close it just looks like i put glitter on my face
don't have a problem with "glitter" looks
for the price this eye cream is horrible
i only have one wrinkle around my eyes
my dark circles do look a little lighter.
i like to wear my eye cream really close to my lash lines
it smoothed out my eyes
perfect for those who don't have severe under eye darkness
it really does brighten the under eye area.
it smoothed things out slightly
after" effect of an eye cream
i've always had dark under eye circles
it was way too thick
i also usually wear eye cream at night
i felt did very little in reducing the puffiness under my eyes
didn't get rid of my under eye circles
really didn't notice a difference in my dark eye circles
i tried this eye cream several times
i noticed my eyes were creasing more than ever while using it
if applied to one eye
however it did not thing for my dark circles or for any puffiness
it actually stings me eyes quite a bit
i do not have severe dark circles
i noticed very dry spots on my eyelids
i don't have bad under eye circles
i still had creases under my eyes when putting on makeup
i love the lancôme face blur
i used it all over my eye not just under the eye.
i don't have dark circles
it made me get little bumps all over
i used a small amount on my hairline where i get dry spots
it has dulled my skin
started noticing some fine lines on my forehead
mostly from being under the sun too much
fine lines on my forehead from being so expressive
caused scaling dry & red patches.
$95 is a lot to spend on an eye cream
fine lines between my brows
only one of my laugh lines disappears
the remaining lines are only softened.
the lines are back
i don't have wrinkled skin yet
i tried patting it on skin like other reviewers said
red patches on my chin
it also was a little red
it is also nowhere near as glowy
it left a white film on my face
would get patchy on the centre of my face
then i end up looking all smudgy in the morning
my skin was covered with like a million little red bumps
i also noticed some skin peeling below my bottom lip
covered in white heads while the other was dry
strong enough that i wrinkle my nose
not on my face or neck
so when my face turned into the texture of a lizard
i get little balls of product
this moisturizer also caused a new little tiny white head to pop up in a r
flaky skin in a few areas
my face was slippery all the time.
around the corners of the mouth
small red dots everywhere
it just sat on the surface of my skin
oily at some spots
when i used it the first thing i noticed was my skin above my eyebrow was peeling
my face was horribly uneven
using it only caused my face to look dull
also great for touch ups
large pores are par for the course
i rather be shiny than red.
the parts that didn't slide off were patchy
my pores looked bigger than normal
even when using a small amount it leaves a very orange tinge to my skin
when the product is spread so thin it seems like it does not help blur imperfections as well as i think it might for ladies who have skin tones closer to the color
more orange than the picture shows
this product left a pale cast on my face
or just too dark in general
this had a more yellowy undertone that made my face look dirty
contour you'd have on that area
my makeup always breaks around my nose
within 30 minutes my skin was shinny and greasy.
and the cushion is already almost dry.
looking squeaky clean shiny where the light reflects off the tip of my nose
then patches of my foundation
i padded it lightly over my face
among many other cringe-worthy irritants in this eye cream
forehead where super red
it worked well for my forehead the very sides of my face
black head are still there
even on my cheeks
i tried the swirl for about a week
i noticed dry patches on my cheeks
flaky skin around nose area
it made my forehead breakout
my chin got super rough
it was too heavy
it was a little too heavy
t was hard to spread evenly on my face
when applied on my face it remained on the surface in a sticky film
quickly fights the signs of aging
the jar is huge though
this has made me weary of the cream
just sits on top of my skin
i still had that glow though
but it's really nice to use on my neck and chest.
i looked like a splintered disco ball.
i will probably use it on my elbows
it's now being used as neck cream.
which left my makeup patchy
my face felt sticky and gross all day!!
after using it for a few days in a row i had large dry patches on my cheeks
within 20 minutes there is lots of oil on my nose
on the flip side
got some in my eyes
i could barely see out of the eye for the next hour as a thick soap residue occasionally came out of my eye
after 2 uses i started getting bumps on my forehead
after just one time i realized that my skin started getting a weird texture like bumpy
the outline of my lips felt chapped
however it completely dried out my skin to the point where my entire face felt scaly
after continued use it caused my skin to became extremely dry with rough patches
it resulted in permanent scaring around the corners of my mouth
perhaps that's from all the rubbing
a lot of little small red dot
it caused me to breakout on my forehead
my skin is still recovering
if you're thinking about spending $200 in hopes of lightening your dark eye circles
a little bit of baby wrinkles as i am in my mid 20s
it actually dried my under eye area
wrinkly throughout the day
i look like i'm burned
left my cheek area dry
i already have a hard time with my cheek area being rough
patted over foundation like suggested wherever shine is a concern
this product blurred out my imperfections in few seconds
especially around my nose
i got endless bumps all over my face.
seeing the eyes really badly
fairly bad fine lines
bought this eye gel for my dark circles
nothing really happened with my dark circles
see on the expense of my lashes
see a little improvement with dark circles
the lines around my eyes seem to have smoothed out/are less noticeable
the dark circles didn't go anywhere
my under eye looked like an orange peel
circles or fine lines
this eye cream is terrible!!
it made my dark circles look worse
always on the lookout for something that helps my awful dark circles
the skin around my eyes became super dry
it doesn't irritate my eyes
in the end my skin felt parched
it has been quiet good at nothing happened to my face like reddish pimple or spots
lately i've been super oily on my t-zone
it's about the size of a lancôme juicy tube or too faced melted lipstain
my eyes are sensitive to the tea tree
still tends to sting my dry spots especially around my nose where i am the most driest
doesn't weigh down the fine skin around the eye
i still have the same dark circles
you barely need a dab for both eyes.
wrinkles or is supposed to make the area around my eyes appear brighter
i really wanted this to help brighten my under eye area since i have dark circles
particularly on my nose
started peeling pretty badly
i find the corners of my mouth
the skin around my eyes
the area around my nose getting very dry
i developed a slight dry path under my eye
it made my under eyes look dry
it sort of clumped or made my makeup look patchy
too much gives me milia under my eyes
got this for my husband under eye creases.
it even made my eyes red.
sting for quite a while
purchased this to try on my smile lines
some fine lines around my eyes
as if i were glowing
that was a shade too dark
it also catches all my dry patches
little second lid are kind of messy
this gel started breaking out my skin in little bumps
like every other slow
i did notice the wrinkles under my eyes disappearing
i woke up to some peeling skin between my eyes
no improvement in dark circles or sagging.
kind of sits on top of my skin
the product sits on top of my skin
don't be fooled by the gold flakes.
it just left my eyebrows looking oily
with all of the hype surrounding this on instagram from lip gurus
great for the lips tho for prepping for matte lip stick or in general
it did broke me out so bad so right now i have pimples on my cheeks bones area
it does not fight age lines or age spots
i even put it on my lips as seen in many instagram tutorials
instead it made my foundation patchy
a spot on my forehead
then i got a lot of tiny red bumps
didn't even feel like it penetrated my skin
i got small bumps
or just a few tiny dots
at the end of the day after wearing this under my makeup i noticed a huge pimple on my cheek
it had little glitter flecks in it.
you could see my heavens from the cheekbones.
sparkly eye shadows pop
put some on my chest as a bit of a body splash
my skin was on the mend
the company reached out to me personally with tips on how to avoid blurry vision
gave me some small blemishes on my forehead.
saw the biggest white cast over my face
just sits on top of my skin
leaves an unpleasant white cast
was hoping to find a higher spf option for my pale skin
too thick in my opinion
sits on top of my skin
it did nothing towards its claim as a pore vanishing primer
my face felt itchy most of the day as well.
i guess i clung a little too much onto the whole "virtually no blackheads in just 2 uses" thing that is huge on the front of the box
cheek area for my entire life
i used a whole mini jar on my face and neck.
if anything it made my face breakout in little red pimples more than ever
the picture completely caught my attention
i still had a few tears occur around the nose
applying-small little tears appear
love the mask though
it didn't cover the jawline or even close
the holes for the eyes
mouth were cut much larger than other masks i've used
it also was very red
even around my eye brows was no expected
my dark circles were still pretty prominent.
terrible camera angle ahead!
the mask aspect of it is a little different from other sheet masks
the mask aspect of it is a little different from other sheet masks
the jelly in the little cup was fine
my nose was red.
sits on top of the skin rather than absorbing into it
i got small bumps all over my face not to mention a nasty pimple by my chin that i'm still working to get rid of after weeks
the sides of my cheeks by my mouth
the bumps were like little welts that thankfully went away after a few days of not using this product
this broke me out so bad with little bumps all over my cheeks
it was for a couple days then i realized these funky little bumps showing up all over my face
felt just light swiping water on my skin.
it left my face looking shinier than usual
in fact, i think it made my face shiner.
the fresh start eye cream
in the fading of my dark spots
besides some new bumps appearing
the newer ones just don't stack up
then the cream stuck to the edges of the bottle.
i keep my eyes closed really tight
my foundation went on extremely patchy especially around my nose where i have larger pores
both times my eyes burned from the pine scent therefore i will be exchanging it
stings when going on.
the entire area around my eyes is now peeling
my fine lines are accentuated because of it.
or dark circles under my eyes
my dark circles are genetic.
is perfect amount of hydration however this gave me a weird bump on my eyelid
it kind of just slides around
actually have finished a tube of this eye cream already
i still have plenty left
hope those dots go away..
there is an irregular skin texture just underneath those circles
inner eye became so dry
worst of all under the eye became so dry that my concealer would get stuck in the creases
the worst eye cream i've ever tried in my life.
leaves eyes red afterwards
found that this cleanser stung my eyes horribly
it is more red
it also made me break out with little bumps
stung my eyes terribly
i noticed a lot of small bumps pop up around my face
including under my eyes
together they fixed my dull skin
they were in my hair
on weird parts of my body like my toes
around my mouth would form
if the mask in the tube was a little more viscuous
it made my face so red, angry & irritated.
the parts that lost me were how incredibly gritty the mask is
after i removed the mask i had tiny white-head like bumps on the corner of my nose
a few on my cheeks
my skin is way more bumpy than before all over my face
i generally have a very smooth forehead
the skin around my nose came off in large flakes
there was a small tingle
is now a bit irritated
my foundation is just patchy
it seems to be disappearing before my eyes!
definitely recommend the yellow mask though!
sits on top of the skin
once it dried i had a visible shiny outline on my face of where it had been applied
i kept waking up with tiny little zits with a few scattered monstrous ones
i looked in the mirror
looking like a snake shedding its skin
it even caused a red patch on my cheek which then turned into a dry patch the next day
i love trying new face masks
i got a pimple in the middle of my eyes on my nose
give me a bright pink pimple on my cheek
noticed how it's shrunk the pores in the areas under my eyes where they are largest
the brightening of scars was the main driving point in purchasing the essence so fingers crossed
red splotches appeared on my cheeks
the next morning i woke up with skin so tight that my eyes appeared distorted
there were scaly patches flaking off everywhere
i woke up with tiny white bumps across my chin
it stings my eyes which is unfortunately a deal breaker
it caused me to break out in small bumps
after a few weeks of use my face started to break out in little red dots
i wanted something to help with dark spots
my cheeks started to sting
usually only my chin stung when i put on products that dried my skin
i spread it over my face when still damp.
my expression lines became more visible
all the scars i ended up getting from scratching at my face
maybe it looked a tad bit worse because i got little bumps on my forhead
i threw this sample out due to it leaving red blotches on my skin the day after that also had a burning sensation
i've used better overnight masks.
heavier mask to wear overnight
still had dry spots
this lip mask is good
my lips were only slightly softer in the morning
perhaps my lips are just weird?
never on my cheeks
the more i break out in a patch by my nose
my eyes get absurdly puffy overnight so maybe i just need something stronger
then i woke up to all these tiny red pimples on my face
there are way better brightening masks out there
i walked around all day with an ashy-coloured face
it did nothing to cover my imperfections
too light while medium is too dark
on the shade range
there is however a slight white-cast in flash photography
out of the bottle it looked quite yellow
so when my breakouts clear up
due to aging i'm getting fine lines.
very mild, kind of like rose water.
the sides of my nose are extremely dry
rubbed it in on my face
even after rubbing it in it left a heavy greasy film on my face
tight than without it
stinging along my chin
for use for anti-wrinkle or anti-dark circle
it contains nothing that's going to take down the appearance of dark circles or wrinkles
no good for dark circle
doesn't tighten eye area
of course the dark circles still there
i found zero results from this product on dark under eye circles
feels like average sephora under eye cream
been breaking out much more than usual lately on both side if my cheeks
the spots feels a little tingling after putting it on
i get bumps ever so often
red spots all over my face
definitely makes my under eyes significantly more puffy in the morning
all dark spots look exactly the same.
i noticed grey on the pad
it leaves the nastiest film
first when you rub the serum on your face it has a slight stinging sensation to it
i almost can't use this anywhere on my face- it causes pimples- except i dab it around my crows feet at night
it caused red bumps and scaliness.
not in the sun
i spread just a little across my face
on the flip-side
i didn't notice any change in my dark circles or puffiness or lines
i still have the jar
get a bunch of spots on my cheek area
as if it has striped away all the oil
within hours my skin starts to become bright because its shiny from the excess oil my skin has produced from being over dried
every once in a while it leans toward drying
it left almost a greasy
i've using this for over a month now because a sephora employee recommended it to me for the dark pigmentation i have around my mouth
breaking out in little bumps
instead it gave me red bumps
woke up to the bumps
i noticed some small bumps along my jawline
ts pretty disappointing to have three large spots on my chin
in the morning i got three white heads on my chin :
still ended up covered in white bumps
it was actually the serum crumbling off my skin
started developing so many white heads all around my cheek
my problem area is always my forehead
so seeing as how my cheeks
chin started developing bumps
breakout prone somewhat sensitive skin ended up with many more bumps after using for about a week
i usually end up rubbing it between my palms
breakouts were all over my face in 30 mins
my face is normally clear
the sides of my mouth
i started to developed white bumps
white bumps are gone
exaggerated my frown lines
i wouldn't think of wearing it under foundation or eye shadow
it sits on top of the skin
i am starting to show wrinkles around my mouth area
should it be yellow?
the next day i had at least a hundred clogged pores on my face all over my forehead
the sides of my face
it is still lingering
the color was like a dark yellow
something in it makes my eyes sting even when the moisturizer itself isnt in my eyes
the scent is so strong it burns my eyes just being close to them
my face can barely absorb it
even my legs don't like it
i feel like i already look greasy in odd places on my face
i found the scent stuck around far too long
it left my face rough
especially during the hotter
acnes started to popped out around my cheek.
was hoping to reduce a couple of faint age spots.
slightly indifferent to the product
and tiny ones all over my cheeks.
i still have a very shiny tzone
i got patchy and terribly blotchy.
now i only use it under eyes
on the smile lines
the dark circle is absolutely lighter.
black eyes were still obvious
oddly enough my other fine lines were unaffected
unfortunately i find this lotus eye gel a bit irritating under my eyes
my eyes will water at the corners
fine lines started to appear
this product however did not help decrease my dark circles or de-puff my eyes
my biggest eye area of concern is darkness underneath the eyes
it makes the skin around the corners of my eyes so dry
i noticed the skin under my eyes taking on that paper thin look from lack of moisture
don't expect dark circles
didn't de puff or lighten my circles
noticed the lack of dark circles after one day going to apply concealer
my eyes are prone to dark circles and puffiness.
the skin around my eyes sting
as my eyes are looking worse than normal
there is only product basically around the outer edge of the container only
did little to reduce the dark circles though
i need something for dark circles
dark eye circles etc
my much cheaper larger eye cream
i've tried many eye products to help with my puffy eye bags
it actually made my eyelids have dry patches which is something i had never experienced before
it actually made the dark circles under my eyes st
haven't really noticed any effect on puffiness or dark circles
i do feel a slight sting in the outer corners of my eyes when applying
lesson the circles under my eyes
i do not have dark circles.
my eyes remained puffy after using this
i don't have dark circles
eye-rollers that work way better than this
not directly below my eyes or right on top of my eyelids
the ache i have in my eye has lessoned
stings a little bit too.
always look puffy in the morning
the few times i used it as a mask i ended up with small pimples on my forehead
it caused little red marks on my face
woke up with dry irritated skin
red bumps which i have not had in years
i started to get a few bumps on my lower cheeks
but i woke up to flaky skin.
doesn't burn the eyes or sting the face
unnoticeable bumps on my skin that i chose to ignore
thought it was pink eye
it is too thick
i need a little something to get the grim off.
a little irritating at first
a little bit of the loose powder foundation to set it
especially eye make up
it didn't reduce post dark spots
i applied to multiple spots on my face
i only used it a couple of times on a particularly pesky outbreak
i genetically have dark circles around my eyes unfortunately
maybe also deal with dark circles
unfortunately, this irritated my eyes so much.
i didn't notice any difference in my fine lines/creasing under my eyes
it did nothing for my dark circles
didn't help with my dark circles or puffiness one bit like it claims
this eye cream claims to diminish dark circles.
my dark circles are genetic (as most are).
blue vessels shining through
it helped smooth a few fine lines
crows feet still there.
like half a tiny pump for both eye areas.
i like to use eye creams pretty close to my eyes
just stick to application around eyes
crows feet area at the closest to the eye
it was too greasy around the eyes
this made a huge pimple under my eye the next morning
as for diminishing fine lines
i noticed more fine lines under my eyes
sometimes gave me a stinging sensation
dark spots underneath my eyes
i will be going back to the black pine cream.
it just forms white patches on the face.
i accidentally bought this instead of the advanced brightening sleeping facial
though not as much as the sleeping facial
lean towards more dry
i broke out in tiny little whiteheads all over
especially around my mouth
i did notice major breakouts around my chin
very dry in other areas
the number of bumps on my chin has increased
shiny after i used it
it sometimes leaves a little bit of eyeliner in between my lashes
i get little tiny bumps that looks like baby warts
taste are all a thumbs down for me
it made my already red skin
(horrifying especially with it being summer).
it made my skin more red
big pores on one side of my face on my cheeks
cheeks are very big
looked like i had dried skin pockets on different parts of my face
my face began to get little red bumps around the eyes
my face is now covered in tiny red bumps
its also on my eyelids
i am prone to white heads--not the bumps i've gotten since using this product
always been somewhat of a pore sqeezer
than a red face all day
unfortunately the pink/rednedness of my face has not lightened
this made me more red and blotchy.
still help with the sudden small breakouts i get
emphasizing the dry patches even more
my very red cheeks
red in certain areas from being so dry
as i've aged my skin has become redder
recently had a weird breakout around my mouth/chin
bumps on my forehead
my skin flushed bright red within moments of application
my cheeks can get a bit red from it
does appear to tighten the skin a bit
this product did lighten my dark circles which is great
it's a stretch to say it 'diminishes' dark circles
to also lighten the area under my eyes
i tend to get circles often
this full size product stings my eyes
my eye lids would turn pink
it doesn't do anything to lighten under eye darkness
dark circles or anything else
i am yet to see any dark circles disappear
dark circles under my eye
i would probably recommend this product to those who do not have hereditary puffy/dark circles
dark circles under my eyes
it did tingle when i put it on the underneath of my eyes
it has helped my dark circles somewhat
as they appeared "blackened"
did nothing for my dark circles.
it stings both under
the bar has a weird shape to rub directly on your face
ascetic wise it was a large bar with a dry appearance
left a tight tug to my skin
this made me break out with tiny dots
shoulders as i tend to get blemishes on these areas periodically
the clay just runs everywhere
i got so many on my forehead
dry around my nose
it stays in the under eye area
unlike a lot of other masks
however the second time i used the mask it stained my face red
it was also red
i've had trouble with other face washes being too harsh
my eyes and surrounding skin was all black.
i grew some bumps
which are deep inside
meaning the directions inside the box state that the product cannot be rubbed on the face
since the supermud mask is my favourite mask
by 5pm my face looks like an oil slick
leaves patches on the face
was covered in tiny bumps
it clung to dry patches
otherwise i am left with flakey bits of skin everywhere
even on my forehead
after a few hours it seems like my forehead
made my face super shiny too
normal in the cheek area, oily everywhere else.
oil still breaks up around my nose
t's hard to really spread across your face
this stuff gave me huge dry spots on my cheeks
i notice i have less trouble with skin flaking around my nose
dark spot correcting claims
even helped slow some breakouts down
i didn't eel that this serum reduced any of my dark spots nor evened out my skin tone
scars to go along with it
harsh winter weather ridden skin
i awoke with little whiteheads along my cheeks
the small bumps reappeared
noticeably help with my dark circles
my eyes were burning like crazy
they turned bright red
although my face was soft everywhere
my cheeks turned super red
since i don't have many problems with my eye area other than dark circle
it didn't help me with my dark circles
look at my under-eye profile in a mirror
did nothing to my dark circles
doesn't get into my eyes
the under eye bags do seem to de-puff a little
turned the skin under my eyes red
i would definitely look elsewhere for a puffy eye remedy
it does not clear the dark circles
not so much on the darkness though.
however my eyes look just as puffy today after using it
this product didn't help me with my under eye fine lines/puffiness/dark circles at all
has no wrinkles under his eyes at all
my under-eye area feels tired more than ever
i switched to eyes balm and i love it.
loss of elasticity around my eye area
for my nearly 40 year old eyes this is a "so so' eye cream
it seemed quite heavy
my search continues for the perfect dark circle eye cream
right underneath my eyes it turned bright red
this product irritated my eyes
unfortunately saw no change in the dark circles or wrinkles under my eyes
line reduction around my eyes
my eyes get irritated and skin gets patchy.
this eye cream fell flat
i used sephora's written reviews to help narrow the search for puffy under eyes
this product made under my eye area puffier.
there have been no changes in the lines under my eyes or the sagging above my eyes
did not tighten -- just sat kind of gummy on my face
never rubbing it in
so rubbing other stuff on top
also be very careful around the eyes
i even try to avoid my eyes
given that it stings the eyes so badly
avoid the eye area.
cheek area for as long as i can remember
found that small black heads are not removed or diminished
are just concealed under the skin making little bumps
it stung my oiliest areas
straight up burned my drier areas
my lips were torn
made it really red
in 5 weeks it literally made my pores visibly larger
my pore getting even bigger than before.
i actually found that my skin texture in areas became rough with tiny bumps when i used this product
it felt like a heavy mask
although it is still breaking out with new blemishes caused by this cream
my face is slowly returning to the sensitive
my skin still shine on the t zone
after near month of use my pore haven't shriek one bit
it was way too thick
crumbling off of your face
some ingredient is so strong that in the morning i would wake up with both eyes irritated
especially on my nose
i only applied it to the tip of my nose where i have noticably enlarged pores
not only did it make the area of the sunburn way worse any surrounding areas were bright red
my face usually gets a slight sunburn after a full day out in the sun
still use this occassionally
exchanged it for the lighter weight face cream
the mostly dried cream started balling up on my face
sometimes i wake up with dry patches on my face
dark spots are slightly lighter
this was too thick for my face
every time it stung my eyes
rather it just sits on the surface
started to notice little white heads
there were slight tingling / watery eye sensation if it gets into your eyes
although being blemish prone
very sensitive -- alternately very congestion
super dehydrated on the flip side
tend to battle flaking in some areas
especially around the mouth
i found that this caused my eyes to sting
it tones down after having it on for a little bit
while it didn't strip my skin
would love to see some dark spots fade
if you get even the occasional break-out/ enlarged pores/ black heads
was very itchy after i cleansed the first few times
however it made my beard all white
like i just rubbed crisco all over it.
my skin felt tight and parched all day long.
i've had this eye cream for a while now
it'll sting my eyes to the point of crying
the next day the pimple just popping out one by one
i find it sits on my eyes
then it pools in the little creases under my eyes
i did see a very faint softening of some fine lines
i noticed my eyes watering constantly
i wanted to minimize he dark circles forming under my eyes
there's still plenty left
it did nothing for my dark circles.
didn't see any improvement in dark circles or under eye wrinkles
my under eye area is dry
it kind of dried out my eyes
have inherited a pair of deep wrinkles below each eye
was hoping for more help with the wrinkles around my eyes
great for perking up tired eyes
undereye circles or lines
my eyes looked a little more crepe-y than usual

also, it causes my makeup to crease like crazy.
making those nasty little crows feet disappear is important to you
it still felt too thick
feels watery when spreading it around
just like every other eye cream out there
the only way to put it on is to dot
tugging around the eye area
the thickness of the formula made it a little difficult to spread around the eye without pulling on the delicate skin there
i like this eye/lip cream well enough
works well around the eyes
i wish it did more for the lines above my lip
it was a rather dark beige.

my eyes would become very irritated
i noticed tiny bumps under my eyes "milia"
i did have problems with the cream migrating into my eyes at times

the bumps was not visible however whenever i touch my face i could feel the many small bumps which disgusted me
it was still too heavy
lightening the spots on my face
it was much too thick
little bumps started forming on my skin
it was like rubbing crisco on my face.
day after that my face looked lack luster
as it would pill/ball up around the edges of where it was applied
left my under eyes looking pretty crepey
this eye cream does help with dark circles
but my dry spots are gone!
while using this product i've noticed that a vein on my lower left corner of my eye was more noticeable now
my eye area was actually drier
i like their pep-start eye cream better.
for someone on the younger side who's looking to prevent those signs of aging
it definitely smoothes a bit bit i didnt notice any change on dark circles
now have irritated bumps on my lids
hasn't done much for my very severe dark circles
on the plus side, it doesn't irritate my eyes.
sometimes it even stings the area around my eyes.

this eye cream was just okay.
i do get dark circles under my eyes

my eyes were not puffy the following morning
i stopped using it pretty quickly because puffy under eyes outweigh a 50/50 chance of treating wrinkles in my opinion
this cream does seem to slightly reduce the look of fine lines
this is not the case with the bobby brown extra eye repair

on some problem spots
some areas did get bright over night however other areas just got bright red
my skin looked splotchy some areas got lighter
others got darker from being burned
on my cheeks now only starting to fade
i usually use another dark spot corrector which worked

still have dark spots all over my face
it does fade the marks

as someone that was a heavy amount of dark spots
any blemish i have- especially on my cheeks

with my glasses resting there i get small zits in those areas
it made me break out in a much of tiny little pimples
like my face was covered in gooseflesh
more on the dry to combination side
i just have a naturally red face

it twists to reveal a hole which the product comes out of
it also made my face tingle in a strange way
especially around my mouth area
and a tad bit in between and above my eyebrows.
getting waxed leaves me red for the entire day
i've had red, blotchy cheeks my whole life.

making it more red
i think the redness has gone down a little bit
i still have flakiness around my noise and chin.
with some red spot here
i've had very red cheeks my whole life.
after i used all the cream i didn't see any difference in my red cheeks
after that seemed like wrinkles became even deeper
i kept noticing flaking skin in the mornings on my forehead
also, it stung a little a little bit
large groups of deep bumps.
my main concern was dark spots
i still have them still very intense in my eyes
even though it did make my face appear brighter it did nothing for dark spots
it pilled up way too much
i seem to be slightly less red
a forehead covered in spots i had to take it back
also made them darker
it does not have any effect on the dark circles around my eyes
my dark circles are not as dark
useless，not real work on the black circle
i noticed improvement in the dark circles around my eyes
this didn't really help my dark circles at all.
after wearing it at night i felt like i woke up with even darker circles under my eyes
it did nothing for my dark circles
for the dark circles around my eyes
my past experiences with eye creams that don't live up to their hype
as it pertains to actually lightening my dark circles
i'll go back to living with my racoon eyes
have tried almost 90 eye creams in my life to try to at least significantly reduce my severe under eye dark circles
the dark almost bruise like color would lighten
i am not looking to soften under eye fine lines i'm looking to at least somewhat lighten my raccoon eye circles
i used this product on the dark circle under my left eye 2x a day for 3 weeks
still see the dark circles.
i am amazed…i feel sleepy but i look wide awake.

another white lucent product believing it would be just as miraculous
red patches on my face

my eyes always get puffy from the smoke
the cream irritated my eyes
it was wonderful in eliminating dark patches
stings my eyes a bit
i don't think it helps my dark circle problems
gave me horrible red welts--my skin looked
like i'd put a hot curling iron under my eyes
after a few days the skin under my eyes became extremely irritated

this product left my face red
something with which i am unaccustomed in clinique stuff
dried out some parts of my cheeks along the sides of the nose

i got tiny bumps all over my cheeks
it made the sides of my nose super dry
washed my face that evening to find my skin had broken out exaggeratedly
very hard to spread on my face.
my problem areas were still very oily

it made me red and blotchy.
it also left a weird white residue on my foreo.
try to avoid the eye area when cleansing.
after about 3 days of use i was getting small breakouts on my cheek

so i use it as a neck cream now.
just noticing forehead lines
i would wake up with slightly tight skin
the peeling is a little better
fine lines are starting to creep up
it did nothing to fade my sun spots
i love their lifting eye cream
have gotten so paranoid about those little fine lines around the eyes
i developed some white bump under my eyes
dark circles over the lack of sleep
i started to notice that a little bit later the product would clump up
i line filled with the renergie eye lift cream
my fine lines had become huge wrinkles
while it did help with the dark circles
my lines under my eyes looked worse
it burned the skin around my eyes
the skin under my eyes turned red
this dried my eye area terribly

a little strong for around my eyes
my surrounding skin extra sensitive
my eyes seem to be even more wrinkled than they used to be
dry skin around my eye area
fine lines around my eyes to make them look fuller
tried the othere eye cream

i also noticed sometimes it makes my eyes water
no too heavy to where it sits there
still dry patches on my face
i would get bright red patches
i started getting a bit dry around my mouth
it also leaves a little bit of a slightly sticky feel afterwards for a couple hours
to the point i was rubbing my eyes so much now
a day after using it their are white dots all over my skin
before i apply eye shadow
especially on my forehead
just not my nose
even cracking in places
foundation it still looked dry
after using it twice my skin was visible dry

perhaps those with slightly oilier
after using for a few days in a row the little dry patches on my cheeks were out of control
was that it clogged the pores around my nose quite a bit :
i normally get dry patches on my forehead
the little hole in the cap dispenses however much you squeeze out
a dullness that comes with age
after using this cream for 3 days my forehead
i'll be searching for another eye cream
it irritated my eyes like crazy
you may end up with itchy red puffy eyes

didn't help with light lines
chin started getting tiny bumps all over

my cheeks aren't so rough
it broke me out in little bumps everywhere
this seemed to make whiteheads pop up on different different spots on my face
he wrinkled his nose
help out my dry spots
your nose is right there
t zone were always shiny
i found out that my face is having all kinds of little red bumps
my bathroom counter is littered with their signature white
woke up with bumpy skin all of a sudden
a lot of small minuscule bumps underneath the surface of my skin
firmness or lightening of dark spots
dark spots really quickly
it made the skin around my jaw
especially in the forehead area
am only now seeing some fading
yet sometimes it has an "egg-white" look on my face
now i'm having some problems with some pores getting clogged
i still noticed my black heads
it turns a light blue on the face
especially on my nose
my pores seemed to go back their normal size
as well as chin
left my face red
2-3 times per week on my nose where i would experience large pores
bought for teenage skin with real black head problems based on the description
definatley loosened up dirt
on chin it caused my chin to breakout.
it was very hard to keep in in the palm of hand.
they should've worked out some of the kinks a little more with the packaging
it was recommended to me for dark under eye circles
even when i just use it sparingly around the eyes
i also use it on the fine lines on my forehead
the fine lines in the outer corner of my eyes haven't been addressed either
she said that it also treats the dark circles
on the dry side
have some light sun-damage spots
too pricey to keep without a visible result.
a few red spots that actually looked like burns
my skin is still on fire
it feels like i'm rubbing alcohol over a cut
this one just made my face super red
it never bleached my eyebrows
turned my face very red
my face begins to itch a little while later
the blotches looked ever so slightly raised
i am still healing from this disaster especially on my chin
my dry spots were happy
after just a couple of weeks i began to notice a bunch of tiny clogged pores around my chin area
i wanted a plump up affect because i have hereditary hollow deep set eyes
don't really have crows feet or fine lines
the sting under my eye is too much.
i am 33 with fine wrinkles around my eyes.
my sun spots have not faded
on the area under my nose
can they at least throw some rose petals in the jar
look younger and lose weight!
the hair on my face kept getting lighter on growing
no one likes wearing rotting fish!
on my neck already
stays on the face forever
it reminded me of opening a mysterious tupperware container lurking in the back of the fridge
uneven skin so the lady at the clinique counter suggested this
it was far too thick
there may have been some very slight fading of some dark spots on my skin
it still had the occasional pimples that would give me new dark spots to worry about
this worked to fade away my dark spots
especially for those living in the east coast
it has not lighted my dark spots from old acne scares
however i don't see much of a difference in the appearance of dark circles around my eyes
it seemed to make my eyes look less puffy
just extremely dark circles
my eyes start to burn
underneath or just underneath my eyes
no change in my eye puffiness or shadows/reddish brown under the eyes
it also made it burn around my eyes
my eye area is dryer than the other area of my face
have some fine lines by my eyes in addition to light circles under my eyes
it did kept my under eyes area moist all day
brighter eyes are still a wish away
it did nothing for the dark circles around my eyes
my dark circles are different
much better as a nighttime eye cream.
hasn't helped with my dark circles or fine lines at all
as far as dark circles
it initially stung the fragile skin under my eyes
i already have dark circles to begin with
idark circles are still the same shade
have had fine wrinkles around my eyes
it gave my eyes the chicken skin appearance.
little white bumps all over my lids
noticed no improvement in dark circles or wrinklesit irritated my eye instead of soothing it
it did nothing for my dark circles or fine lines
underneath my eyes became really dry to the point where mascara was sticking to my skin
i did not notice effectives results do the dark circles around my eyes
it did not for my dark circles
it did absolutely nothing for dark circles or lines
there is a nice tightening effect around the eyes
what about the dark circles?
such as my dark circles visibly getting a little lighter
every time i wake up there's no sign of puffy or dark eyes just major dryness
ntense it kinda ate right through the other eye cream
zero effect on the dark circles.
maybe they're putting gold flakes in it??
a little dot of product goes a long way with it foaming
i can rub it all over my eyes without any discomfort
i am always skeptical of eye products that claim to help reduce dark circles
i still had pretty large dark circles
the bags under my eyes stayed puffy
not the other eye
i never had dark circles
originally i got it for my dark circles
made my puffy eyes get more puffy the next day!!!
my under eyes are still puffy
i don't have puffyness under my eyes.
i am still in search of a miracle under eye product for dark circles
i like the way the roller feels under my eyes
i think most of these products are made for puffy under eye circles
not really a stinging sensation, but a bit odd!
did nothing for my dark circles
i didn't mind the stinging/burning sensation
i've developed a red scaly patch under my eye right where i apply it
no change in dark circles or fine lines.
definitely wakes up the eyes a bit
it made the underneath of my eye look dry
i noticed a deep wrinkle that had formed under my right eye
all of my concealers were getting trapped there
my eyes still look puffy.
i never had trouble with the dark circles
my dark circles worst
bad sleeping leaves the lines resting on small bags
it burned the area under the eye
its hurt my eyes!
i mainly got this for the darkness under my eyes
i read someone else's review about how their dark circles ended up looking like bruises
it makes the skin under my eyes sting
turning them so red
some help with dark circles
it actually made the circles under my eyes look worse
almost like it bruises
cool under my eyes
my small bags are still there
my mild dark circles haven't changed a bit
it also dried out the skin under my eyes
made the little lines under my eyes more pronounced
this one just feels like any other under eye roller with metal ball in it
sometimes it tingles a little too much, too.
using this product was to help diminish the look of my dark circles
it even improved the color of the dark circles under my eyes
now my face is covered with little red bumps
i rather have a dry face than a red bumpy one
i used this product everywhere except for my nose
it barely made a dent in my on my dry arms
led to tons of white bumps all over my face.
a bit on the stickier side for my preference
my face get lots of red patches
it got super red
this serum is highly ironic because it made me turn bright red within seconds of application
one was so thin
i tried this product for a couple months with no decrease in the sensitivity or red/pink color of my cheeks
it kind of lingers through the day
f you have some spots in your face of capped cheeks
i do notice the morning after i put it on the redness in my cheeks is completely gone
it made my face red all over like an allergic reaction
particularly in our hot summers
my face still gets really red
nose caused by tiny
many products sting my face
and i now have lines under that eye!
every morning i woke up hoping to see smaller pores/skin peeling/red skin or any reaction at all
notice after just a couple of uses that it seemed to make the fine lines around my mouth less pronounced
left with cloudy vision as the oil sticks to the lens
this made me breakout on my cheeks
i also seemed to cling to dry spots.
i broke out a little on my jawline
still had a shiny nose
i found after 1 week of use it "masked" my face light red
it tightened my skin
shine on my forehead
my face broke out with 3 large blemishes
my pores looked bigger not smaller.
it's red, blotchy and very dry.
this product made me break out in tiny pimples all over my face
right after my cheeks turned out super red with an awful burning sensation
it was more watery in the big container
my face was extremely red
as seen in the picture my face is red
my whole face peeled off and was really flaky.
my whole face peeled off and was really flaky.
especially when it gets in my eyes
there is this film over your eyes
following day i developed white heads galore :(
my skin turned very red
all over my forehead
i just keep getting new breakouts
bump and white heads galore.
bumps on my face
his company goes around giving this product 5 star ratings to trick poor unsuspecting pimply people
flesh colored bumps everywhere on my face
my concerns were uneven skin tone
a deep expression line in my forehead
the grim facts are
had to put a spot of red nail polish on the tiny
my forehead lines seem to be slightly better
since it works well head to toe
minus practically scraping the oil from my face
never on my cheeks
wrinkly all over my face with this
after just two days of using it my face started to get really blotchy
my face become more oily at the middle of the day
when i tried this my cheeks became crackly
my under-eye circles were not remedied.
i've used different eye rollers before this
lightly hold it over my puffy eyes
they're even visible in baby pictures.
his are from lack of sleep.
leaves the area sort of shiny
for dark circles that are genetic like mine
this product does help with my boyfriend's dark circles
the best thing to reduce dark circles is lots of sleep
product didn't really work on my puffy eyes.
i used it on one eye
sometimes i wake up with huge bags under my eyes
this does not de-puff my under eye area at all.
this has some kind of glitter it in.
never made the puffiness under my eyes go away
i admittedly have some pretty puffy under eye bags partly due to heredity
it has not reduced puffiness or dark under eye circles
i often have puffy eyes in the morning.
in the morning when i wake up my eyes are very puffy
i really can't tell a difference in my eyes being less puffy
i still leave the house with puffy looking eyes
eyes looked the same
as for dark circles
i see no difference in my under eye bags/circles.
i feel like my dark circles
i really found that this serum made my dark circles look worse
sometimes wake up with puggy eyes
use two pillows instead of one at night so your head is slightly elevated
an my skin is starting to show some fine lines
not fixing my dry patches
it's $40 and my dry patches are now gone!
my skin has been parched by this winter season
did nothing for my dark circles
just dry under eyes
the skin around my eyes
my skin happily drank up every bit of that eye cream
i can just "roll" it off in the morning by rubbing my eye area gently with my finger
they should have made the jar opaque
an average eye-cream for me.
i still have puffy under eyes.
i did not have shadows under my eyes
cannot comment on the removal of under eye dark circles
i noticed every time i used this eye cream i felt this stinging
burning sensation around my eyes
on the hunt for another eye cream!
it does not aid in removing dark circles or fine lines
it did not plump up any of my fine lines or crows feet
suggested that this would work for my dark undereye circles
did nothing for the dark circles
the skin around my eyes got little bumps
this dried my under eye area
it didn't irritate my under-eye area
since it doesn't bend
there may be the teeniest tightening in the creases
after two weeks all i've noticed are some clogged pores :
within a week my face broke out with tiny white pimples
this serum made my skin break out and become red.
i still have some weird red
it did cause a small breakout on my décolleté area at first
also tried white lucent a few times
bright right after using it
use the rest to shave your legs with less than a pea size amount
bit by bit the lid stopped functioning as a lid
telling her my concerns for aging around the eye area
think it is kind of difficult to apply evenly around the delicate eye area
making a mess of my upper eye
i expected to like the eye cream as well
did not improve the dark circles
fine lines under my eyes
it did not improve my wrinkles or dark circles
it did clog my pores under my eyes so now i have little bumps
have recently developed very dry skin around my eyes
still i noticed more of an improvement from perricone's high potency eye cream especially on my dark circles
it has done a good job on puffiness around my eyes
when i get home eyes are puffy.
just a little "freshening up" around the eyes would be nice
with a thick film on top
stuck her nose right in my eyes
i wouldn't buy this if it turned my brown eyes blue
like fish left out in the sun.
just red splotches from my skin being parched
my forehead would look so shinny
especially around my cheeks
it irritated my eyes horribly
i didn't even put it near my eyelids-- just having it on the undereye area was enough to cause stinging
mixing in a little bit of too faced anti-shine primer helped
it was actually burning patches of skin on my face
too heavy for me, but the hubs loved it!
my skin is back to feeling uncomfortably tight
i developed small dry areas on my face
my entire face broke out in itchy red bumps
this is a big thumbs down
it really irritated my eye area
after a few days i noticed my skin seemed flaky
makes me all teary-eyed
a line of small bumps on my cheek since using this
it also dried out my lips even when i only got the tiniest bit on them
it has done nothing to improve the blemishes/under the skin bumps on my chin
i would get little whiteheads popping up on my chin
bought this face wash hoping it'd help with the big red blemishes i get along my jawline that would last forever
almost a little bit sticky
i always have a couple tiny breakouts
after using it my skin wasn't red or irritated
even on my cheeks which are normally on the dry side
particularly on my chin
perhaps it is still effective on scars
i see a slight reduction of red bumps around my chin
i felt like it pulled a lot of face hairs out
the mint in the mask actually made my eyes felt itchy
other oily prone areas of my face are still clogged
i noticed that there was black residue left in my pores making them look worse
nothing was even visible on the peel off.
none of my black heads were gone
if you put this on your eyebrows or mustache your screwed
my face still red
my entire face now has really bad peach fuzz all over
it use to be just by my sideburns
since using the mask regularly it has made hair grow all over
to be honest normal drug store nose strips work better
the white mask by boscia
she has tons of black heads
after seeing the black mask craze pop up on almost all social media platforms
i didn't see anything stick to the mask other than a few hairs
glad i didn't use too close to my brows
it also made my eyes water
when i got to the nose area only one clogged pore was on the mask
leaves my face red, patchy and itchy....so weird!
its still a good mask
the mask also made my eyes water despite keeping it away from my eye area
cons: made my eyes water
left red patches which were visible the next morning
i only applied it around my nose
my eyes stung like crazy
my eyes still stung a bit for a good hour
in fact instead of illuminated
there are much better black head removing products out there
it don't remove black or white heads
i began noticing red spots all over my cheeks the day after i peeled this off
on the bright side though
it was way too thick
definitely way too thick
the thick consistency made it harder to spread evenly on my face
needs to be rubbed in a bit
also along my jaw line
my face was so shiny
i looked like a doll with too much oil glow
dark spots or anything else
i started using this mainly around my eye areas
just now noticing fine lines around my eyes
not even a hint of a whisper of change.
around my outer eye
it did not remove/fade any dark spots on my face.
i applied both to my neck
the parenthesis around my mouth were starting to look deeper
the fine lines in my neck are still there
dark spots are visible, and are multiplying.
my line does seem slightly less deep
now my face is no longer red
still get bad flare ups
everything i've always read suggests that light dabbing
my makeup would always crease.
dragging the delicate eye area when applying
you only need a tiny bit!
tone of my eye area
sadly has done nothing for the dark circles
i started to get little red bumps around the my eyes
therefore you can't spread around the eye without rubbing
the face cream was way too heavy
my dry patches are peeking through my makeup
my skin appears parched
neck almost felt sticky throughout the day
there were a few occasions where i felt a little burning on my sensitive skin
after a few hours of wearing it i felt a bit itchy
in the morning i woke up with tiny zits all over my cheeks
on the bright side it doesn't break out my clog-prone skin
right up there with ponds
still saw flecks of my eyeliner still on
then i started getting a lot of texture around my upper lip
my forehead looked flakey almost
my skin immediately turns red
by mid day i can see dryness around my nose
completely broken out in little acne bits
my pores seem to appear bigger
it was a little thick
since i like bobbi brown
it remained a bit oily
she said it would instantly plump fine lines around the eye
first use i watched the lines under my eyes plump up
the skin under my eyes would feel tight during the day
i creased really bad the few times i tried to wear this underneath makeup
this felt nice on my eye lids
it started to kind of burn my under eye areas at times
something in this cream causes my contacts to become blurry
i still get creases
don't suggest it as a day eye cream
this cream is a bit on the harder side
try to pat on around my eyes
unfortunately it made my eyes puffy the next morning
however after three days use i broke out in a lovely constellation pattern
about five pimples along my under eye are where i never break out
i tend to have very dry skin around my eyes.
i don't have lines or circles around my eyes
both the extra eye repair cream
or i may just use it on my chest and neck.
i've worn this under several foundies
instead it made it worse with my already oily skin caused crease lines
i really liked the product until i noticed at the end of the day my cover up was splotchy on my nose
behold a new pimple on my cheek has started to form
i wake up with oil slick face
the consistency is too thick
just dab it under my eyes
one last day of red eyes
beware if you are prone to milia which are those white dots that look like zits
all those youtube guru's are talking about how great this bobbi brown eye repair cream is
i could barely open my eyes in the morning since they felt puffy
something to help combat my dark circles
it did nothing for my fine line puffiness or dark circles
not so soft to use it the eye area
it does nothing for dark circles
this eye cream is a bit thick
the eye repair cream hasn't helped with the dark circles
has ever helped with my dark circles
it actually made my forehead lines appear more prevalent
my entire face had those little white makeup flake/balls we have all experienced
little fuzz balls were in my hairline
there is a white film that is visible after it drys
or any other line or crease on my face
if you frown or just as much as squint your eyes
the creases are back
not moving muscles in my face
smoothing right before my eyes
there is a white residue left on afterwards
once you start blinking or talking or moving your face at all
little white "crumbs" will appear
soon a white film appears
this was a big white mess
just enough to lightly cover my under eye puffiness
like a smile made it worse
still the residue remained
it left a white film
if i thinned it down a little for the white film not to show
cons: white cakey spots where skin is a bit more dry like under eyes
the white film remained
leaves a nasty white film on your face.
i used it on my forehead
this product was recommended to tighten up the deep wrinkles
loose skin on my neck
particularly the cheek area lines
tried this on the outside eye corners
the white powder everyone talks about is there
i tried all the hints for getting rid of the white
i got tired of finding the white crust on various parts of my face through out the day
cant walk around with white streaks all over my face
help deminish the fine lines on my forehead
made me break out all over my forehead in tiny little bumps
the magic is over
ter in this is a no for those who are prone to clogged pores
my skin is still recovering from the extra sensitivity
it left my normal skin still felling thirsty
it made my face too shiny
t stings my eyes
it rubbed off into little rolls after rubbing it on my face
sadly it broke my sensitive skin out with the small bumps that never come to the surface
relatively obsessed with sun protection
my face began to turn bright red
really unhappy because my face had tons of red bumps all over
coming off your skin in little balls
my eyes were just as puffy as before.
i would recommend only for those with mild under-eye shadows
it made the area underneath my eyes puffier than they have ever been in my life
definitely get fatigued puffy eyes working those 12h shifts
didn't do squat for my dark circles
dark circles still there
dark circles from anxiety
after using this my eyes are so puffy that i look like i've been ugly-crying all night---to the point that colleagues are asking if i'm ok
i saw no puffy eye or dark circle improvement
i think the wet-look even made my puffy eye more visible before makeup
dark circles even though i'm young
it's helped some with the dark circles
this does nearly nothing for my puffiness with my eyes in the morning
does nothing for puffy eyes
while it does cool the under eye area
it does get rid of my puffy eyes
it did nothing for my dark circles.
brighten the eye area
the metal roller feels really nice on my eyes
if i run my fingers over my face they are suddenly covered in white balls
it dried out my face around my mouth
the sides of my nose were pealing
flaky as well as irritated with red bumps
in the most sensitive areas on my face
i found it just a little bit hard to spread on my face
it feels more heavier on my face
i ended up with creases in my makeup
i would wake up with white flakes under my eyes
it dried my eye area out
seems to be helping with the fine lines around my eyes
it appears as if the purple has risen to the surface of my skin
it seemed that my dark circles had become so deep purple
in a rest room mirror
my darkness under my eyes was so dark
on either side of my nose
i noticed a difference in my dark circles right away
the skin around my eyes looked less wrinkly
obsessed with this eye cream.
the slight gold tint lights up my eyes
reflects away from dark circles
only to reveal the cream is in a little bag around the pump
i noticed strange little beads had formed under my eyes
my eye area felt quite dry
it actually made the skin around my eyes
did nothing for fine lines or dark circles.
a consultant gave me a sample because i want to try something for my baggy eyes with some darkness
really helped my dark circles
i noticed the skin around my eyes was incredibly dry
this cream instantly reduced my dark circles
it was a bit thick for an eye cream.
it also has not helped with purple circles.
hoping to brighten my eyes by minimizing my dark circles
after a few uses it actually gave me wrinkles under the eye
it didn't do much for my dark circles or puffiness
after pictures of my eyes
fine lines have almost dissappeared
when i raise my eye brows the skins still feels a little tight
i wouldn't have minded this if the product had diminished my dark circles
leaves a white film on the skin when packed on
my stubborn dark circles did not slightly change
i am not asking it to get rid of dark circles or the crows feet
this cream is very nice for the fine lines around the eyes
nope, it leaks out of the lid gap.
i found it very heavy
hard to spread over my skin without serious rubbing
this really reaked havoc under my eyes
it's on the thick side.
it didn't irritate my eyes at all
it seems to soothe my eye area
and it really sticks around.
smaller than the top that you twist off
doing nothing for dark circles
applied i left a sticky feeling around my eyes
my under-eye area still appeared dry and dull.
the small wrinkles around my eyes are still visible
my black blue still there the same colour
softening the color of dark circles or helping with pufiness
it didnt help with dark circles
just need some moister around the eye area
also, it did nothing for my dark circles.
i felt some tiny bumps forming
even one underneath my eye
try the blue one much better
my face was less red it was even a dewy
i woke up with tiny little whiteheads all over my forehead
it left a sticky film on my face
get little red/raised bumps all over my cheeks
there is an area under my eyes
on top of my cheek bones that could use a little help
perhaps smoothed down would help
s off my face because sliding them along my skin felt sliding them along glass or polished marble
on the side of my nose
nothing changed to my pore size on my nose
dry patches all over
maybe my pores got just a tad bit smaller
my pores looked the same on both sides--still big
my pores seem to look about the same size
the skin there was covered in red blotches that were surrounded by bright white skin
this caused me to get some red, flaky patches.
didn't do much for my dark spots
mine is so thin!
on the bridge of my nose or my smile lines after 2 weeks of constant use
around mouth versus cheeks
chin since a little goes a long way
not the miraculous forehead line eraser i'd hoped from either product
even when i used a teeny tiny dab all over
long term i started noticing what seemed to be big zits/boils that never would surface or turn red under my skin that lasted months
i i turned bright red in sensitive areas
my face turned bright red
my face was red
this stuff made my skin bright red and tight!
even when i totally avoid the eye area
it actually left dry patches in my marionette area
with a few subsequent applications it burned holes in my skin
goes on nicely, not too thin or thick.
chin were still very noticeable
splotches even more pronounced?
my lines around my mouth were more pronounced instead of less
even when the lid was tightly closed
after about one week i noticed my skin looking super saggy
did not reduce dark circles
i wanted it for my dark circles
it worked very well on my dark circles
night by lightly patting it in
it did nothing for dark circles or fine lines
fine lines under my eyes
to try to soften the fine lines that are starting around my eyes
my eye area would become unbearably dry
no difference in my fine lines and dark circles.
i didn't see a difference in my wrinkles or dark circles
it made my dark circles look worse
caused little bumps under my eyes
bags under my eyes
it made the dark circles under my eyes not look /as/ dark
watched my eye area gradually look worse
the forth day i woke up with pronounced dark circles
this dried my under eyes out so bad!
it made my entire eye region very wrinkly
i will admit that this eye cream definitely de-puffs tired eyes
i've always struggled with dark circles
it didn't do much for puffy eyes or fine lines
i still have dark circles.
it has really irritated my eyes
deeper lines on my forehead
eyelids had those little white makeup flake/balls we have all experienced
alas the white residue remained
this really does smooth under eye lines.
i dabbed a little under both eyes
particularly about the bottom lashes
gave a somewhat hollowed eye look
around my eye area
as well as alone with a brush
have never seen glitter in it
who has rather puffy under eyes
several are actually bad for skin especially around the eye area
sadly it exaggerated my fine lines
it made my nose shine less than the other high end primers
the white residue is a serious problem
it burned my eyes so bad
this product tightens the skin around my eyes very quickly
struggled with the white residue
used it under my eyes
works well to smooth under eye area with no white residue
i don't get that white layer/film that a few people have complained about
it also caused some creasing under my eye make-up
first it left a white crust under eyes even when i used a tiny amount of product as the directions state
to keep that tight look
dark circles are darker.
my eyes were red
so on mornings where your eyes are particularly puffy
there are still flakes
hoping to find something to minimize the fine lines below my eyes
it left a white flaky film on my face
under or with the firmx eye
this stuff does tighten up the skin under the eye
it turned chalky if i left it on
t does improve the under eye surface area
i too had issues with a white residue
hid some of the finer lines around my eyes
even unnatural looking when i would laugh or smile
sort of "hard" when i'd smile
i can only equate it to a crumpled piece of paper that you try to flatten out
sure it helps with dark circles some
it adds to lines under your eyes
make my eye burning
it felt like i had elmers glue under my eyes
still can't get the white stuff off from under my eyes
now i have red puffy eyes with a white film.
it made my eyes look like they were peeling.
once i put my eye cream
my eyes had more crinkling
this does seem to take down some of the puffiness under the eye area
although this product does firm under the eyes it leaves a white film
it tightened under my eyes amazingly
not under my eyes??
i still got white stuff around my eyes
it sort of seems more along the lines of a primer
particularly with a little powder piled on top
running my finger over my nose
i felt as if i was left with a faint amount of dried clay on my face
it seemed to be a white-ish tinted cream that just kind of went over the pores
they were the same size just kind of a lighter tint
a few on my cheeks/under my eyes
i still had black residue under
around my eyes from liner
i started to get some on my cheeks as well
find it sticks to my hands more than face.
it looked like a tinge of darker yellow was floating in the middle of the lighter yellow in the bottle
it had a super thick texture that was difficult to spread on my face
light weight - when wearing alone3.
little bumps starting popping up on my t zone
more frequently on my face
i noticed new red bumps that weren't there that morning
i am one to rub it all over my face since my lips could also benefit from spf
juts to make my life more complicated
didn't spread well across my skin
it lightened the dark circles under my eyes amd moisturized my lips
it slightly lightened the dark spots under my eyes
i tend to get dry patches under my eyes
it didn't fade any dark circles
did nothing for my under eye circles
did not help with dark circles or fine wrinkles
did not help with dark circles at all!!
help with firmness around the eyes
did nothing for my dark circles.
i got some flaky skin around the inner corner of the eyes area after i started using this cream
that problem kinda heal little by little
i don't have extremely dark circles
i wanted something for the fine lines i have under my eyes in the inner corner as my foundation pools into it
my old eye cream on the other
on the eye i was using this one my circle got slightly darker
it doesn't work on dark circles or fine lines.
definitely does nothing for fading dark circles
it does brighten up dark circles
my under eyes looked dry
i don't think it has helped with brightening my under eye area
if anything my eyes look even more darker
it didn't help fade my dark circles at all
didn't brighten my under eye either.
it also burned my eyes
let alone fade dark circles like it claimed
nights underneath my eyes
in terms of brightening or fading under eye circles
i don't even have that dark of under eye circles
especially in that area between my inner corner
also - this stuff stings!!
it unfortunately gave me bumps under my eyes that loked like mosquito bites
i noticed fine lines slightly disappearing
my dark circles are still there
dark circles haven't lightened
my eyes still have bags
lightened up my bags considerably.
dark circles are still dark
haven't even appeared lighter one bit
left me with red spots
i see no improvement to my dark under eye circles
no improvement to my dark under eye circles
i dont think its fading my dark circles :
if you've always had dark circles
which thankfully fades fairly quickly.
seeing as it was recommended for the chronically over-rosy
give some firmness or lift to my jaw line
every time i used a small amount on my very dark circles
my dark circles stayed about the same
i've had dark circles for the longest
it mattify your under eyes
will have white cast on your under eyes
it's actually seemed to dry out my eye areas.
love the little side window
i also like the little window on the side.
cover my dark circles under my eyes on the day of my wedding
i am desperately searching for an effective eye cream that reduces dark circles
my eyes were still puffy
i still had dark circles
: literally did nothing at all to my dark circles
it actually gave me these little fine white bumps under my eyes
didn't help with my dark circles.
i think my dark circles are worse
it didn't really address my dark circles
the product promises to help with dark circles
the first few days i thought that it really reduces dark circles
my dark circles stayed dark
have crepey skin under my eyes
i've also always had dark circles too
i've tried just about every "dark circle eye cream
have always had dark
its not going to fade your dark circles super fast
did not help with my dark circles
eye lids began to dry out really bad too
i saw no lightening of my under-eye area.
have had dark circles under my eyes for as long as i can remember
i've never had issues with dark circles
burned bmy eyes like fire
my circles are just as dark
my eyes became so puffy that it felt as though i had poison ivy
circles were darker as well.
this cream really dried out my under eyes
i feel like it did reduced the fine lines under my eyes
i love putting it under my eyes mostly for the coldness it offers
my under eye areas were still dry.
i've tried a bunch of different eye creams from sephora
it did not improve crows feet or under eye wrinkles
i don't suffer from dark circles or puffiness just fine lines forming
i got the full size of this mainly for eye area dryness
my fine lines have continued to creep
like every other eye cream i've tried
it does not reduce dark circles at all
it made the area around of my eye dry
patchy to the point of peeling
this made my skin under my eyes sting.
i also developed a red line on the outer corner of my eyes after using this
i started getting fine lines around the eyes along with dark circles
it did completely eliminate my under-eye circles
it does nothing for dark circles
my main concern is dark circles
i tend to have very "parched" looking skin as well as dark circles
it still stings around the eye area
so many products make my eyes tear.
i feel it helps keep the fine lines under my eyes from being so noticeable
second applications i noticed a tingling/stinging sensation on my under-eyes
the burning/stinging sensation continued with each use
i will say that it *dramatically* reduced the dark circles i have under my eyes
as well as provided some serious luminosity to my eye area
i wanted to sample this product mostly to address the tiny little lines i'm starting to get around my eyes
it made my eyes water
dark circles around the eyes
while it still irritated my undereyes a bit
then after 2-3 days i started noticing little bumps around the corners of my eyes
this eye cream does not irritate my eyes
it felt very sharp
the beads are so small
some patches are white
kind of like when your white shirt is stained
even just using a tiny bit
is doing nothing for dark spots
didn't help with the dark spots
my skin was covered in little red bumps
this burned my skin badly!
basically is just like slapping orange juice on your face
this caused it to get really congested
although it did help lighten my dark spots
also on my cheeks :
i noticed my eyes would get that "eye goo" throughout the day
as far as wrinkles, fine lines, etc.
my eyes would water
just after a week of using it my under eye area is already less crêpe-y
your eyes will be irritated
it stung my eyes rather badly
stings my eyes whenever i wear it
this eye cream caused my eyes to turn red
loved the "truth is in the eyes" eye treatment
some of it actually clogged the pores of my skin right on the border area between my under eye
i don't like rubbing a lot under my eyes
it finds its way into my eyes
even my eye liner
transfers to just above my crease as well as below my eyes
i gotta have my eye shadows
my eyes started burning
the skin under my eyes
especially under the eye area
this made that spot tingle in the wrong way
my eyes turn fiery red
actually accentuates the tiny fine lines around my eyes when used under makeup
i've used this eye cream for at least 1
the tip of my fingers
seriously irritated my eyes.
my under-eye area often felt dry
that during the first few uses my eyes burnt just a bit
pat it under the eye area
my eyes start to burn
difficult to spread around the eye area without stretching or pulling the delicate skin
tiny jar doesn't last very long at this rate.
my eyes kept watering
yes even around my eyes
it stings when applied under my eyes.
the skin under my eyes is as dry as ever
my eye area is very dry.
eye shadow primer cause creasing near the inner corner of my eyes under the lower eyelids
those little lines around my eyes
i ended up with very shiny lids
the area around my eyes
super bright eyed cream was out of stock
am starting to see some red blotches
caused some small bumps
i think this is what minimizes the lines from appearing so deeply creased
it's not the best for puffy eyes
my eyes aren't sagging as much.
no difference in appearance as far as dark circles or fine lines disappearing
made my eyes water
i noticed that the skin under my eyes started itching
it was also a bit pink
i developed a few little bumps on my eyes -- milia
bottom line is that this increased my lid puffiness while doing nothing for my eye bags
treat mild dark circles -- this didn't do much
it hovers between tingling
i started to have little bumps under my eyes
did nothing for my dark circles
i don't have fine lines or crow's feet
if dark circles is an issue for you
this makes my eyes burn something fierce.
made my eyes puffy
dark spots i had before
over all this is the best under eye cream i have used to take away the puff under my eyes
it has done nothing for my dark circles or my fine lines
it seems to make them a bit puffy
it also made it very red
leaving no unpleasant film
this product comes in a big bottle to disguise the two smaller bottles inside
a friend and i both bought to fade dark spots.
i hate my dark spots ;(
it has faded the spots somewhat
not raised or pocked
more time is needed to see if my sun spots begin to fade
when i hadn't had a pimple since high school
light pigmentation spots stayed the exact same
now not only are my cheeks red
i think at times it might have darkened the spots instead
they seem to be darker in some areas
though i like thinner ones a bit better
the oil is black
the instructions say to get a small amount between your fingers
my mascara barely budged
the next morning i woke up with 20 tiny whiteheads on my forehead
it felt a little like snot mixed with gritty mud.
my skin has even been left with some deep
under-the-skin spots
it just beads right up
left my face with red patches
the eyes cream is nothing special
began to get little bumps all over
spreading it very thin
it sits on top of my skin
plus i started to get small/pimple bumps on my face once starting this
face is usually clear
found it to be a little heavy
noticed massive dry blotches under my chin
my fine lines seemed even more visible
they both are sleeping masks
brittle in some places
made areas around her eyes
this caused me to get little bumps underneath my eyes
the top of my cheeks after one use
flaky dry patches though
no reaction / dry patches
wound up with crazy micro-zits all over the parts of my face where i was applying it
the sticky film that it leaves behind is what caused the breakouts
still not burn my eyes
not always around the eyes
need to be careful around the eyes as it stings.
it stings your eyes
after testing eye shadows in a nearby sephora store
i can alternate it with my everyday eye cream
i may stick to this when i'm wearing very low key or no makeup since the radiance helps with the darkness under my eyes
it's been very eye opening!
this eye cream is definitely on the heavier
absorb nicely in the eye area
it started stinging my eye area
every single time my eyes still look tired
i've had dark circle for like 3 years now.
i've noticed the dark circle
my under eyes are pretty puffy
have another eye cream that helps with my dark circles that i would prefer over this one
when i wake up in the morning the circles under my eyes aren't as dark
de-puff the dark circle/bags from lack of sleep
it doesn't depuff as much as it brightens the dark circles under my eye
the cream has a light peach tint to it which appears to be how they cover up the under-eye circles
the area under my eyes where this had been applied looked very shiny
it also made me break out in tiny bumps on my forehead
made me break out in tiny bumps on my cheeks
the bumps just stayed bumps
my face was tight
i get dry patches in between my eyebrows
dragging my fingers down my cheeks garnered a tiny squeaking noise that was unsettling
it stung my eyes really badly
dried out some of the spots
it left reddish purple markings where i had put it on my skin
the bottle is so tiny
tiny size, and makes my skin feel taunt and dry.
the pimple is still there nothing different
works great on tiny bumps
i also started breaking out in tiny whiteheads multiple times a day
then i started getting deeper oily bumps on the side of my forehead
plus i'm getting a little older
starting to notice those fine lines around my eyes
it cause small white heads after a few uses
sometimes bothers my eyes
part of my face would get this puffy red spot
after using it for 2 night i realized that it clogged my pores around the chin area
didn't do anything for brightness or dark spots though
i would only use it on the outer part of my face
it does help just a tiny little bit to my little bumps underneath my eyes
after a few days i began to feel a bit of irritation around my nose
a bit on my chin
chin as if the product burned it a little
especially when i used it on my neck/chest
when i used this i was developing a dry patch on my neck
balances there are no dry patches
it stung my eyes when removing my eye make up
my face would turn red
literally i had dry patches on my cheeks
it brightened it up quite a bit too
little on my chin
be very cautious using this mask because immediately when i washed it off i counted 8 breakouts on my forehead
a few on each cheek
i prefer origins out of trouble mask
she has a huge red mark on her face that looks like a bee sting
it tingles going on
after taking the mask off i realized my skin got red patches everywhere
good mask for tightening
the mask left my face looking sunburnt
white/blackheads that seemed even more enlarged the next day of using the mask
used nothing under my other eye
my dark circles got worse from using this
my eyes are still dry after wearing this eye cream
sometimes it even goes into my eyes
coming after a cream that caused huge red patches this is very nice
it doesn't do anything special in terms of lightening my dark circles or smoothing out my wrinkles
even i used my eye to see cellphone a lot
not bad for eye cream.
i only gave it 1 star because i got tiny white bumps under my eyes
the skin around my eyes became more dry
instead of helping with my extremely dry under eyes
my under eye area became so dry
this stuff irritated my eyes
caused the eye area to get red
i noticed that my under eye area is so greasy after using this
did not fade dark shadows as the description implies
it made my under eye lines worse
i developed little bumps all around my eyes where i used the cream
i've noticed it irritates my eyes from time to time
i found that it burned my eyes
i also found that the pores around my under eye were becoming clogged
my face started to get little dry patches
grew into disdain for this product
my face comes out shiny in pictures.
this mask is fine.
it gets patchy sometimes.
some patches were even flaky.
i tried a lot of origins mask
especially the area under my nose
it left my skin red
it did nothing for my dry patches on my forehead
i prefer the origins overnight intensive mask in the green tube
my skin is prone to break outs
it barely helps with the tight feeling i have
the bottle is also pretty tiny
very prone to breakouts in some places
i still had lots of dry patches
makes me break out in tiny bumps
the skin around my eyes feels a bit pinched
the size of the pimple stayed the same.
just make it red
forehead is less oily after though.
squeeze a little out on your finger first
some with bigger red spots
i got the small pods
leaves a very unflattering black residue on your face
now it seems you've fallen into the "charcoal" trend instead of focusing on your staple skin care line
i found this to be true when my pores around my nose actually seemed larger
feels so good cooling/soft skin/kept my oil at bay then i noticed all of my pores are filled with black
i freaked out thinking i had a bruise when applying my makeup
the "cooling" felt more like holding ice to my face
i need something a wee bit heavier during the winter
but i still like the tingling/ cooling effect.
more on the gray side
you'll have black streaks on your face
on the bright side
maybe about as big as a thumb in diameter with at most a 1 inch in depth recess
i found it was thick
the eye cream is alright
i don't really have crows feet
it hasn't helped my dark circles
day 3 i started getting little tiny red bumps around my eyes
this did not diminish dark undereye circles
the product too close to my eyeballs
it has clogged the little pores on the outer edges near the corner of my eye
my under eye areas became red
had little dots everywhere after i applied it at night
this one seems thin
i started noticing signs of aging around my 34yrs+ eyes
this origins product also made me a bit puffy
other than my face just looks shiny
all over my forehead
fine lines were less visible, too.
such as fading the dark spots in my skin
it sits on top of my skin
the annoying tiny little whitehead-like bumps on my forehead disappeared
my dark spots still were visible
the consistency was way too thick
this was too heavy
on the flip side
it also was on the thick oily side
it is a bit heavy
the bottle is a little too fragile
it caused me to break out into red dots all over my neck
it made my eyes
the area around my eyes itch like crazy
did nothing for my droopy eyelids
now my eyelids look even more crepy.
i loved it for my puffy eyes in the am.
bought this because i was obsessing over the fact that one of my eyelids seemed to sag a bit
by the last drop my eyelids upper
being in my early-mid 30's i've started noticing some aging around my eyes
it's to the point where i now have patches of dry skin on my eye lids
the area is red
now i'm back on the hunt for a good anti-aging eye cream
it did help to lift my eyes lids
under the eye i became very dry
perricone eye cream for sensitive eyes was better
youth to my upper eyelid area
i also noticed that my eyelids seemed to be lacking moisture
my lids looked so much younger.
this product caused my eye area to feel tight
my semi-droopy eyelid was flat
the next week my eye went droopy again
then my eyelid got all dried out
asked for an eye serum that's the best for dark circles
darkness under my eyes
it irritated my eye area.
the product definitely does tighten my upper eyelid
especially near the lash line
especially for my eye are
it felt irritating around my eyes
really see no liftingbof eye lid
dries quickly i haven't really noticed the changes to my eyelids or dark circles
i found that my skin overcompensated
it's been giving me tiny little red pimples all over my face
chest that needs the oil too
that i had to put on lots of mist
it did show a little plump to my face
definitely no firming or lifting or extra-glow.
i would have less prominent lines on my forehead
not even a slight brightening or one small wrinkle faded
would tighten my under eye skin
now i am left with dry under eye area
slightly sagging upper lids
saw maybe a 10% improvement in the lower lid puffiness
it also gravitated into my contact lenses
it just isn't firming my lid area
i see more pronounced lines around the eyes with continued use
does help decrease dark spots
firms your eyes over time
the skin around my eyes started to get irritated
scaly patches that would only heal when i stopped using the produced
except the skin area near the side of my eyes
the shininess has been at bay
it still left a bit of radiance peeking through.
it made my eyes water.
after a few days after trying it i noticed that the pores on my cheeks besides my nose were huge
it flakes off near my brows for some reason
found several new blemishes all over my face
just sits on top of the skin
by the end of the day my skin is also patchy
red itchy bumps like what others describe
so many white heads
only my nose gets shiny even in the winter
this product darkened my spots
i woke up with small little bumps all over my face
especially in the drier areas of my face like around the nose
it made it red
i developed little bumps
it is way too thick
didn't use on eyes.
i still felt like a layer/film of the balm was still covering my face
i also notice some very tiny black dots in some pores
it also stung my eyes
it stings the eyes
i got like two huge crater looking pimples on my face
with only a few lines around my mouth
still have fine lines
the lines on my forehead
the cap is made of a very brittle plastic that shattered when i dropped it
and it lingers for a while.
flaky in the winter
the orange clashes with something
i managed to spread it on my cheeks fine
i found it a bit too heavy
the truth serum lightened my dark spots
i think it's also causing my skin to become more uneven
this doesn't even resemble an orange sent like some people mentioned
it left creases in my fine lines even though i used it lightly
pulse points instead of my temples
it doesn't irritate my eyes
then it goes back to being noticeably enlarged
my face was just as shiny without it!
out of nowhere my skin got super shiny
this helped me control oiliness on the bridge of my nose as well as the sides of my nose
my forehead remained shiny
my face starts to get shiny
it keeps giving me congestion
showing off my imperfections instead of hiding them
dimished any spots or prevented spots from forming
the stick was maybe not even a half a inch tall of product
dark circles i have under my eyes
my eyes when i'm tired
it made my eyes water
i wear my life under my eyes
i still haven't found the perfect cooling puffy eye remedy
i love the idea of a stick balm for under the eyes
which is very uncomfortable for underneath the eye
then there were the various degrees of cooling in between
my under eye area is extremely red
no sting at all
not watery/heavy like other eye area products
it honestly is barely the size of the end of my pinky to my first knuckle
i can't say much for the affects of puffy eyes
dark circles since i only used it once
the menthol is so strong for the first few minutes that my eyes burn
doesn't make my eyes look brighter or more awake
tiny bit of product for the $.
it makes my under eye area itch
then causes little red bumps
the tingling sensation turned to burning all day long
didn't much help my puffy eyes
my dark circles are more red than brown or black so might just be me
i find my dark circles the same shade as when i first started using the product
few wrinkles around my eyes show when i smile
it knocks off some of that morning haze right away
there is less than a quarter inch of eye balm in there
the balm itself is also only about 2 centimeters tall
pretty sure the tingle instant relief is short lived
one "wrinkle" under each eye
i still have dark circles and my one wrinkle.
i don't see much happening in the de-puffing of my eyes in the morning
seemed to irritate my eye area after a bit
my eyes where so irritated with this product!
i don't suffer from puffy eyes too often
though my eyes are not very puffy anyways
i'd still keep one around for when your cheeks are sunburned or you feel tired
look in the mirror-nothing
twice as thick-at most
menthol like fume was so strong my eyes stung for about a half hour after applying
it actually made my eyes sting
my eyes were showing it
i am 37 1/2 with a thin face
dry patches on my chin mainly brought about by the weather
if possible stop the fine lines forming around my eyes
dark circles that i occasionally have
it caused light milia over the time
my dark circles are very noticeable
it didn't plump up my fine lines at all
the first few times i used it my skin just glowed
i try a lot of masks
used it on my neck
i also think this might've also created some tiny little whiteheads on my cheeks
and my face doesnt look like a shiny mess!
it helped with my dry spots
cons: it often sits on top of my driest patches
facts- i have dry skin with fine lines on forehead
in fact i am seeing one more line on my forehead.
lip lines were "almost gone"
since starting the regimen by face has been covered in bumps
after spending hundreds of dollars my skin looks worse
rub it between my palms prior to patting it on
expected it to do something to the the dark patches on my cheeks
sadly i get little white heads the next morning.
my skin has been horribly congested lately
it does sting a little
i noticed so many white bumps on my forehead
i did develop little white bumps all over
a little bit of fine lines on my smile line
i got some red dry patches around my mouth
woke up the next day to splotches that were still there
the red splotches that were starting to flake off
my skin was a little red after wards
i occasionally get a pimple or two when aunt dot comes
have some dark spots from very old acne on the chin area
i get dry patches around my nose
after using this cleanser two times i've noticed a lot of white heads on my chin
i did get a few small bumps on my face the next day
after 3 uses ended up with white heads on the apples of my cheeks
shocked to wake up in the morning with over 20 tiny whiteheads
feeling bumps/breakout along my jaw line
i only have slight wrinkling around my eyes so didn't have anything to firm
my skin isn't sagging
i already noticed that some of the fine lines were turning thicker
made me break out along my jawline
hundreds of tiny bumps everywhere!
also this irritated my eyes.
the breakouts on my face weren't just a spot here
left a faint burning sensation
in fact, it dried out some parts of my face.
i am sitting here at work after using it just once with red puffy eyes
this doesn't help to improve or even conceal my frown line
i am starting to see the beginnings of some wicked marionette lines on my face
does a decent job of filling in fine lines on forehead
i got this product in the hopes of making them fainter
crease into the lines on my forehead
have deep lines under my eyes
it stung around my eyes pretty bad
still on the hunt for something to help my frown lines
does seem to minimize the deeper wrinkles on my cheeks to some degree
there was no fill or puffing of my wrinkles
i realize that deep wrinkles are hard to address
i think it works really well to dab a little bit on the under eye where it's puffy
found it too thick
particularly in those lovely lines between my brows
doesn't spread too well on the face
i'd get flakey on my forehead
only the occasional small pimple it might possibly work
my face was broken out in lots of little bumps
it made the area around my nose
small pimples everywhere that don't go away
just bough this for the occasional breakout
my face got red
it has my face break out in huge itchy welts
my chin looks like a warzone right now.
for some reason it has glitter in it
not to light not to heavy
made my face sticky and tight.
in addition it slightly stung my dry patches
which i find irritates my eyes
dried it up more than usual
i like the light
this is the first eye mask i've ever used.
it was cooling on my eyes
i ended up with dry patches on both cheeks
i don't even like the feeling on my eyes while the mask is on
i love the other sephora eye masks
didn't pump up my fine lines or took away my puffy dark bags
did nothing for my dark under eye circles
i definitely prefer the boscia sake under eye masks
since this mask covers the whole eye you have to just sit
it did nothing for my dark circles
unlike the under eye gel mask i have been using
this eye mask is one that goes over your eyes
the other sephora eye masks that go under eyes are much better
not a full eye-covering mask
it doesn't form to your face/eyes.
i woke up with puffy eyes
there are no eye holes so you must close your eyes
my eyes were still puffy
i don't get puffy eyes very often
it had to be 1/2 inch thick
there were no eye slots
where was the tingling or something.
i am starting to get a tiny sag on the lower rims of my eyes
i started searching for eye treatments after noticing my stubborn dark circles won't go away
i still have bags under my eyes
it did absolutely nothing for my puffiness or dark circles
the way it clings to the eye area is nice
if my puffy-eye situation were a normal
my bumps were still there.
seen my skin fail miserably
striped my skin leaving it burning
on the bright side..its not over drying?
the lady squeezed quite a bit out
the face remained somewhat sticky
it made my face really red
within an hour i had the usual oily sheen on my face
the first time i used it i was horrified by how my makeup looked cakey especially around my eyes
my nose was still shiny
i rarely get a blemish
sun spots never lightened
skin tone also remained the same
these glowing reviews are a bit too glowing
my skin got progressively worse
like i rubbed olive oil all over myself
i ended up using this mostly on my legs and hair.
i only put on a tiny bit
as a face oil however
this stuff is not for those with sensitive noses
maybe even made it more pale.
it made my skin soft after wards yet
i like masks, a lot.
spots on my forehead
only made my cheeks
literally the only product that's keeps my face from cracking
those annoying mid day flakes from popping up
its a little too heavy.
i woke up the next morning with tiny bumps on my cheeks that weren't there before
itchy at the end of the day
it didn't brighten my eyes in any way.
i developed lots of tiny red bumps on my forehead that took a week to disappear
this product mildly covers up dark circles
doesn't cover up too dramatically
definitely not helping with the dark circles!
it does a good job of *kinda* hiding the circles
actually made my corners of my eyes dry
i can't rate this very high when my dark circles are still there
my dark circles are just as dark as they were before i started using this product
is there a product out there that works for dark circles under the eye for black women?
the metal tip felt cooling on the skin around my eyes
did not help with my dark circles or brighten.
went to buy the origins cream for dark circles because i liked the sample
like how it moisterizes my under eyes
i really like most clinique products for my dark circles
no help to dark circles and way over priced
my dark circles are caused by lack of sleep
it doesn't irritate my eyes
dark circles under my eyes
when i look in the mirror i look tired
while i will admit it helped to lighten my dark circles perhaps a shade or 2
i got this originally for my dark circles.
there are brightening properties in the cream that makes the circles appear less dark during the day
however, my dark circles are still visible.
my eyes are still dark
i just purchased the all about eyes rich cream
i always have very dark under eye circles.
i found this "corrector" did nothing for the darkness
there are small bits of glitter in it which i am not fond of
i've always had dark circles.
i did not realize the "optics" were actually going to be a shimmer underneath my eyes
puffy under eyes since it was from clinique
my desperate search for a product that could get rid of my dark circles
hardly works in lightening my dark circles
i find my eyes more parched
my fine lines so much more visible
this does not help with dark under eye circles at all
use their other eye
my dark circles are still there
maybe my circles are too dark
under eyes felt dry
i saw no results as far as lightening dark circles
as i have slight dark circles under my eyes
the product also dried out the area under my eyes
not enough so to completely hide the dark circles
this product primarily works on the outer edges on the eye
with little to no coverage as you work towards the inside of the eye
sometimes even accentuates the dark circles further
have ask ways had dark circles under my eyes
when itially applied it looks a bit less dark
it only comes in one shade
it made my under eye area very shiny
did nothing to disguise my dark circles
has had no effect on the dark circles under my eyes
the silver tip is cold
i would have trouble with fine lines at the corners
for the dark circles
i started to develop tiny bumps under my eyes
my dark circles aren't too too dark
this is nothing more than a watered down concealer with an ugly yellow tint
my dark circles are still dark.
have had dark circles
it also made my eyes dry
i really don't see a difference in my dark circles
i could hardly smile
i still didn't notice a difference with my sun spots or other blemishes
i got this giant pimple smack dab in the middle of my cheek
my face was extremely soft up until my skin turned rough from the clogged pores
it did not have the same yellow color
my skin is still recovering
if i touched my palm lightly to my face
the blackheads that i had worked so hard to get rid of had sprung up all over my cheeks
usually just a spot/a couple spots here
i still have the dark circle around my mouth
saw zero difference in my dark spots and pores.
i feel like it didn't make a difference in my fine lines or freckles
at the same time caused little red breakouts allover
it did fade fine lines
especially in my forehead
the spots on my skin have not faded at all
the next day i woke up i had all tiny white pimples
i've npticed some bumps/small breakouts on my face
irritated the mess out of my skin
it has somewhat been helping with pores
there's a small hole on the top
the directions called for a thick layer in affected areas
it seems to make the zits turn into a dark red spots when used overnight
i don't think it really improved the appearance of zits much because it left these dark red spots
its a little hard to rub all the way in
it leaves red patches where the breakouts were
just the odd pimple that remains stubbornly
i've actually woken up with new outbreaks sometimes
have had a few accidents with it spraying all over
overall good if you have black-head issues
also fades away pretty quick
i used it mostly on my laughter lines
this is on the heavy side
my face was white as a ghost after applying this.
lots of money for a neck
my dark circles were still there
helped plump it up some
the first bottle had more of a watery consistency
it made the dark spot spread out
make it very vulnerable in the sun or even under bright lights at home
always worry i'm getting more on the sides of my fingers than on my face
i see little bumps on my skin
i get considerably pale in the colder months
more over it irritates my eyes
the only disappointing this is that the label says not to use it on your upper eyelid
it did instantly brighten up my eye area.
i can't have my eyes stinging all day
this under eye cream doesn't make a difference for people with dark under eye circles
it gave me little bumps
irritated the sides of my eyes to the point where my eyes would water up
i consider myself to have pretty bad dark circles under my eyes
bumps popped up on my eyes
this product burned the skin around my eyes
my eyes kept watering
her eyes stung like crazy too
there is no long term brightening or lightening of dark circles
my dark circles never budged
it has a stinging affect on the eyes.
the 'evening primose' eye cream by wild rose was much more soothing to my eyes
at the same time my eyes started to feel itchy
had a serious allergic reaction under my eyes in the form of several small tiny bumps that took 3 days to resolve
asked the associate to recommend an eye cream for under eye darkness
switched to a regular eye cream from clinique
too much eye cream gets squeezed out
making my eyes burn
in brightening around eyes
it says not to use it on upper lid
also, it really stung and burned my eyes.
this really left my under eye area looking greasy
i broke out with little red dots under my eye after a few uses
now my under eyes are a dry and scaled.
i though this product was alright at reducing dark eye circles
probably the clinique even better eyes dark circle corrector
didn't see much of a difference in my crows feet
within 6 hours my face broke out into a million teeny tiny pimples
i keep putting this on those"puppet mouth lines" that are on the sides of my cheeks nearnose
still had flakes all over my face :-
notice tiny bumps forming the day after
the $24 bottle is quite top-heavy
weirdly burns my eyes sometimes just from being on my face
i love using this for my toes and legs, however!
i am not happy with the appearance of red bumps on my face
i started getting little breakouts on my face
as in i get flaky all year around
my skin just got more red
left me with red bumps all over my cheeks
as winter is rolling around
the next day there where zits everywhere
it has smoothed lines on my face
it made me break out with tiny white heads
it dried out the soft skin around my eyes
we got crazy pimples all over our noses
my face has developed tiny little bumps all over
i've also developed patchy areas of hard skin
on the bright side
in fact a bit to heavy
the only brightening effect is a shiny slick all over my face that does not sink in
cheeks near my nose that never came to a head
i would almost rather have the huge congested pores
there were pieces of leaves
i finally bite the bullet
looked like large flakes of dead leaves in concrete
takes care of black heads
as for tightening the purple mask from glamglow does a better job
i still like this mask
it made my cheeks red
worst "tingle" i've ever gotten from a face mask.
once i washed it off my skin was bright red.
i found the "tingling" to be quite intense
every time i went to use it the edges were harder
a lot of bumps started to apear on my skin
i needed an eye cream that would treat the few fine lines that have cropped up in recent years
along with dryness around the eye
it did nothing to reduce my dark circles
well it wasn't- it made the skin under my eyes red from usage
i dot it onto my eyes
spread with my ring fingers
my eyes have beginning stages of lines
twisting in too many directions
made the area around my eyes tight
eye cream and slowly lines are disappearing.???
my skin is still as splotchy as it was before
weird places like the side of my cheek or under my jawbone
not the typical t-zone spots
however i wasn't over the moon about the texture
while the heat in my area has been rather intense
gave me red splotches
the same thing happened to him: big red splotches
i feel as if my dark spots have gotten darker
i still have my sun spots
the area around my nose is still red
while it does not brighten my dark spots
it even makes my dark circle under eyes less red.
acne mark brown spots on my cheek so noticeable that i could tell only in just within a week
it feels tighter than usual
has no effect for the dark eye circles or the wrinkles just a good eye balm
dark circles associated with this problem
doesn't creep into my eyes
i don't have minor sagging under my eyes
a darker under eye area
it also makes my eyes heavy
tired because this product irritates my eyes so badly
because it irritated my eyes my lashes had white specs at the tips of my lashes
the white stuff was stuff that kept producing out of my eyes due to the product aggravating my eyes
does nothing at all for fine lines or dark circles
no help with dark circles, lines, lifting, etc.
ii'm really disappointed because it makes a claim about upper eye lids
lines under my eyes
i guess my eyes are just too sensitive because it stings my eyes
what disturb me was my dark circles was getting darker
i've noticed a very faint stinging sensation as i apply
this came highly recommended by a friend with puffy eyes from new baby lack of sleep
my issue is under eye dark circles
i think the dark circles got worse
thankfully sephora's return policy rocks
the brightening mud on the rest of my face
every time i have been left with a red burning patch of skin afterwords
my face was visibly red
when i say red i don't mean reddish
i mean actual red like clown hair red
still have a very red face
my face is still a very intense red
noticed these tiny white heads around my t-zone started showing up that weren't there before
patchy after this mask
my cheeks stayed red for a few hours.
so as a harsher mask
noticed this got stuck into my pores
then the next day i had a pimple on my cheek
like i had egg white on my face
one that is thick
i also get dry patches on my nose
i get small bumps
my forehead looked really oily
men generally don't wear foundation
the skin turned bright red
i've seen my cheeks get pretty flush before
i'd say this is better for dark skinned people.
now i apply it on my legs after waxing
after continued use my pores looked visibly larger
chin which since my teen years is very rare
i don't have fine lines around my eyes though
this gave me puffy eyes.
i still got puffy eyes
small, itchy bumps everywhere!
chin broke out with a lot of small pimples
it stung a little bit
woke up to lots of little bumps on forehead.
left my face looking shiney all day
honestly my forehead lines look worse after using this product
right now my cheeks have purple spots
more prone to the oily side on tzone
it's in my cheeks
see some of my lines soften
this product made my lines look even deeper
i tried this product hoping it would act as a plumper for the fine lines on my forehead
dry up the area around my eyes
which is ultimately counterproductive as it makes your dark circles darker
only mask the problem areas
my circles were reddish
irritated the skin around my eyes- my skin burned
bags under my eyes
he has large under eye circle
when i look in my car mirror every morning i can very well tell that my eyes look much worse than before with a few deep wrinkles
areas away from my eyes
it irritated my eyes
it has made the small lines under each of my eyes worse
there were no difference in my dark circles or under eye puff
i don't have under eye problems
just a little stinging sensation
i look a wee bit younger
it still hasn't helped with dark circles
it's sensitive with dark circles
i felt an instant unbearable burning sensation when i used this eye cream
especially under eye area
it just irritates my eyes and makes them sting.
now i have two irritated flakey patches under each eye
my eyes got red and watery.
eye cream hoping to fight the little wrinkles forming on my face
actually found my dark circles getting worse
the texture made it impossible to cover up the dark circles
it left by eye area very dry causing peeling
i don't have fine lines my do have darkness under my eyes
it will sting a lot
i am 45 looking to reduce the lines around my eye area
this product really irritated the skin around my eyes
my eyes have never looked this bad.
dab it around my eye
it made my eye area really irritated
this product severely irritated my eyes
my eyes look worse
it irritated my eyes
there are definitely better eye creams out there
old on my cheeks with a few on my forehead
the new scar faded slightly
maybe because my scars were old
i still have the same ole scars
in the area around newer scars
i used this diligently for about three months straight on a scar under my chin
i applied a fair amount on my leg twice a day because there are a few mospuito bites which left ugly dark marks
the red/purple-ness from my breakouts would be gone in 1-2 weeks
when i put the product on at night i woke up with multiple tiny flesh-colored bumps around the scar
the bumps appeared as well and itchy.
perhaps this is good for those who have small scar
this lasted too short for person with big scar.
it faded some of the darkest ones quite well
the newer scar actually looks worse.
the skin around it is a lot more pale now compared to the rest of my face
i still have a very small amount left in the tube
which has left me with a lot of scars
then i started noticing that i was getting flaky dry patches on my face
my dry patches returned
somehow this made my skin red
for some reason it irritated my cheek-bone area to the point where if i cleaned my face
i began to develop horrible dry red patches on my face
it tingled/burned my face a bit
my skin became accustomed to it
a bit dehydrated- as evidenced by more fine lines
i noticed my face beginning to turn red
my dry patches are back
it always stings my eyes
not only that my eyes look like i've ended up with wrinkles
my under-eyes started looking worse
my main concerns are my undereye bags
my undereye bags appeared more prominent
dark circles looked worse
always used an eye cream after it
i feel like i have got more winkle around my eyes
i ended up with flaky skin around my eyes.
it's no better than a regular eye cream
my dark circles have not diminished
really irritated my skin around eyes
this dried out my eyes like crazy.
would make my eyes look way more sunken
and made my dark circles worse.
then it thinned the area around my eyes
it just felt like jelly around my eyes.
the active ingredients didn't reduce my dark circles nor the funny lines on my top lid
my under eye area became sensitive to touch
i don't have dark circles
under eyes still the same.
now the skin around my eyes feels tight
too strong for the skin around my eyes
i did notice a difference in the dark circles under my eyes
now i have a red burn all around my right eye
whether it be a slight stinging or tingling sensation
only have the beginning signs of crows feet
not just the eyes
am noticing some more crinkling in my undereyes
i don't have problems with dark circles
its not thick at all.
it stings a little bit
this dried out my under eye area
actually made my under eyes look crepey and old.
it dried out the skin under my eyes making it rough
i keep waiting for the skin the slough off
this eye cream solved my issue of dry under eyes
definitely not in the color correcting department of dark circles
is immediately effective at brightening up my under eye area
only a brightening effect if i'm actually wearing the cream
9 mo old who is still nursing so there isn't much to help the dark circles from lack of sleep
always have dry skin around the eye area
if this product helped with my dark circles
what i will say is that it definitely brightened my dark circles
making my eyes water
it also blured my vision a little while wearing it
doesnt nothing for dark circles
i felt like it made the dark circles under my eyes darker
of the area around my eyes
as for reducing dark under-eyed circles
this eye cream also makes my eyes water excessively
it does nothing for my dark circles
my under eyes still looked dark
it does not fade away the dark circles underneath the eye
does not help lighten the actual dark circles
i like the routine of having an eye cream
can be seen in the sun
this cream started to irritate my eyes
the clinique is the only thing i've ever tried that reduces the appearance of my permanent dark eye circles
if you are looking to brighten the eye area
going into this i have pretty dark under eyes.
my eyes are still dark unfortunately
it can be slightly thick.
it has not helped with dark circles
my under eye area was burning
did nothing for skin / dark circles.
rather sits on my skin
bought this because i was getting a little puffy
now my under eyes are back to normal
they itched all day
it had a mild sting on my eyes
it's gentle on the eyes
so now i just use it for my fly alway strands.
've switched to josie's argan oil light
s/arm everywhere on my body
it just sits on top and looks greasy.
i tried to use it instead of my usual lip balm
the worst thing was that it dried my lips
used it as an under eye cream
as next day tiny white bumps appeared under the skin
it just sat on the surface of my skin
i've tried using it elsewhere like on lips
it worked to reduce dark circles
got stinging sensation on my skin
is attached by screws at the rear
the flakes are all over everything
beware as you to will have silver flakes all over you
within a week i developed dry patches under my eyes
deepened my fine "happy" lines around my eyes
this product caused a rough
scaly patch under my eye
did not help my dark circles at all
since my family has a history of getting double eyelid surgery due to sagging lids
fine lines i already see cropping up
in fact it gave me dry patches around my eyes
people claimed this brightened under-eye circles
i would say the coloration of the skin under my eyes is virtually unchanged
is that the faint lines i had before are now pronounced
more obvious lines under my eyes
i usually use all about the eyes.
all about the eyes feels like butter.
unfortunately repairwear laser focus eye cream seems to burn the skin around my eyes
overnight my eyes became puffy
this eye cream looks like it might be heavy or too rich for the eye area
brightened my eyes whenever i used it overnight
i also noticed it created little bumps on areas close to the eye
i think this product dried out the under eye of my right eye forming a dark irritated dry patch
i normally use all about eyes rich
the repairwear wrinkle correcting cream left dry patches under my eyes that were very noticeable when i put my foundation on
my under eye area was irritated to the touch
my eyelids broke out in itchy red bumps after one day of use
as it sometimes left a bit of a stinging/burning sensation around my eyes
my eye area became really dry
it might help the little dark areas under my eyes
this cream made my eyes red
it settled into the creases around my eyes
the consistency of this just sat uncomfortably on my skin
ultimately still left a few areas dry
i did notice a breakout across my forehead
i started getting white heads on parts of my face that never ever got white heads
maybe this "mask" only works on young skin
i'll make sure to keep the wei mud tucked with me
the mask slightly stings my face when applied
made my skin rougher than when i started
i usually break out on my forehead
normal skin around my nose
it also seems like it just rubbed off on my pillow
area around my mouth get dry with this product
i started getting dry patches on my cheeks
when i got a little sweaty
left we with really bad dry patches on my cheeks
however the consistency is too watery
had big pop worthy pimples in my cheeks less than a week after use
it turned red and started too itch a little.
it just sits on top of my combination skin
i noticed small bumps all over my cheeks
not for black skin.
this is says "dark spots fade" ..
and also, i think it stuck my pore.
ive been breaking out with red bumps
by the 3rd day my skin was looking redder.
a bit more on the oily side
it more masked on top of my skin rather than absorbing
made my face tight
it left my skin with little red bumps
got a red bumpy breakout
using the rose toner from the set my skin felt really prickly like there were a bunch of tiny needles poking my skin
it left my face with dry patches
made my face oily and breakout.
almost like i have a peeling mask on my face
it was seriously bright orange
i stopped wearing it altogether feeling strange about the orange cast on my skin
the first time i used it i noticed it left an orange tint
the orange tint is a big downfall
it is bright orange/red
the oil spots on my pillow from this product
everyone could use a little brightening right?"
it left orange colour all over my pillowcase
i think i need to look into some other options since my skin has yellow undertones anyway the orange is really not flattering
the oil is so heavily pigmented that i have to massage it in for a long period of time to get the orange tinge to fade away
the tangerine is what makes this orange which is a little off-putting
i used retin-a micro for almost two years which left my skin sallow
fine lines under my eyes
doesn't seem to fade with time
especially not around my eye area
anti dark circle eye creams
i don't think there is anything out there that can get rid of lines/wrinkles/dark under eye circles
my eyes got very irritated
i found it on the greasy side
gave my under-eye area a wet sheen
irritated the skin around my eyes
this eye cream seriously irritated my eyes.
watery for however long i left the cream on
the cream even irritated my eyes.
this one made my eyes burn
rubbed eyes so hard i bruised under one of my eyes
caused my under eye to puff more
one under eye began puffing
after a 1/2 hour the skin around my eyes is still shiny
let's hope my winter pale skin doesn't turn orange
am a big fan of the glow pads in particular
i like being pale
so now my face is really red
noticed my orange face
i wont be covered in orange streaks by morning
more than the tiniest dab every day
it made my skin way too orange
the color tended to accumulate in brown streaks -- using less reduced this
my spots were lighter
even when i did not apply to the eye contour
it always ended up stinging my eyes a bit
just put a tiny amount of cream on the edge of my chin
was hoping it would at least lighten up dark spots
used it on my neck
where i've had just a few white bumps develop
it did nothing for even the finest lines around eyes
doesn't seem to be working on my fine lines which are on my forehead
i got bumpy pimple like things on my cheeks where i never break out
my forehead is now covered in small bumps.
neck break out into tons of small little bumps
after the 3rd day my forehead was covered with a bumpy mess
there are still tight
especially on my face
it stings a bit when i put it on which is strange
i woke up with 3 bumps on the right side of my cheeks
scars are left on my face
(once in a blue moon.)
i only applied it on my chin
i spent the rest of my vacation with red bumps under my mouth :
i woke up the next morning with itty bitty red bumps all over my face
yesterday i got a small red bump that looked like a pimple
once on the mask felt way too heavy
in the past i've broken out from heavy facial products
i live in the north so my skin has been a bit flaky
the oil goes on light
despite using a face brush
i put on forehead, nose and chin.
my dry patches are still there
left my face sticky
the outer edge was white while the middle was pink
by the end it was leaving a white veil.
i would not wear it alone because the color is so strangely pale
left a white/tan film on my face.
even irritated it more
my cheek will stick to it
the problem i'm having with it is the thick film of white
well i'm brown so a white film on my face
it sits pretty heavy on the face
the tiniest amount turned my face into an oil slick
gave me tiny bumps all over my face.
i wasn't fond of the pink sheen it left on my face either
the cream is a little bit sticky on the face.
it caused a white undertone even though i wore it under foundation
dropper thing…too much trouble here
the lines between my eyes
around my mouth softened up
then i would get large pimples around my chin
have a few fine lines
the under eye cream
when applied very thinly
especially on the upper lid
has caused my skin to become very patchy around my cheeks
this one made my skin break out in patches of little bumps
my skin turned red
dozens of closed comedones appeared all over my cheeks by the next morning
my skin looked parched
i am still dealing with the dry patches
my face became extremely red
some dry patches that i had were gone
somehow it made my pores look even bigger
see picture attached of my skin.
it made my forehead
in the two days since have had *very* sensitive/dry patches of skin to either side of my nose
i think the essential oil fragrance irritated my skin when red itchy bumps showed up on my forehead
the resurfacing mask for a couple months my skin got so bad
used only a small amount for underneath my eyes
i used such a tiny bit
puffy eyes are a big warning sign that your body is retaining water
finally i would follow up with a product like ginzing for eyes to fade dark circles
illuminate under eye area
it did not de puff my eyes.
didn't work for dark circles
eye bags at all
usually get it in my eyes too
it doesn't irritate my eyes
people who have dark circles
say 'under eye bags' make it a constant struggle for me to figure out if they mean puffy or dark circles
even though this product was labeled puffy under eyes
am constantly trying new products to brighten my face
it even made my lips incredibly dry and cracked.
after washing my face i noticed fine glitter near my eyes
several times a day i have to pat down my face to hide the shine
it came in a very yellow color
now i've broken out in tiny red bumps
all over my cheeks
the corner of my eyes started itching
then my eyebrow area started feeling slightly itchy
however unaffected parts of my face looked great
tiny bumpy pimples on me chin
deep in the skin
in the morning on top of the blemishes i looked sorta dull
little red bumps just keep coming out.
my face broke out into a lot of small reddened bumps
i kept on getting bumps on my cheeks
i now get white heads on my cheeks
fine lines- which used to be barely visible- are now extremely evident on my forehead
however after about a week my cheeks began to form dry scaly patches that almost burned when i put makeup on
i think adding this serum to my beauty routine helped reduce some dark spots on my face as well
get little white bumps under my eyes
i also found that over time my pores were getting a bit clogged leading to less of a smooth feel
dot it all over my face
i used it around my eyes
my eye area is never dry
my eye shadows didn't look as smooth as always
if i'm wearing make up it does look slightly better on my nose where most of my pores are located
i don't notice much of a distance in my pore size
in spite of it being a rather thick
it started to make my face itchy recently
flaky on the cheek
it does not work for dark circle or lifting at all
i've recently been noticing dark circles under my eyes that make me look tired all the time
this serum stings the skin around my eyes pretty badly
i didn't see any difference in puffiness or darkness around the eyes
not in the habit of spending $60+ on an eye cream
started to give me the "chicken-skin bumps" in the under eye area
left my eyes super dry that the skin around my eyes is now flaking
i don't have horrible dark circles or puffiness to begin with
this *doesn't* seem to break me out or cause tiny bumps around my eye
puffy like i was either punched or had pink eye
the same puffy feeling happened
dark under eye circles
dark circles it made the few fine lines that i had worse
still waiting for some type of reduction with my dark circles
now i have peeling under both eyes
all skin around my eyes where i apply the product
seriously frustrated to be dealing with such severe peeling in a delicate area
fine lines- which used to be barely visible- are now extremely evident on my forehead
some brightness in under eye area
now they appear a bit deeper
the skin around them felt tighter
instead, it made my under eye skin start peeling.
still crepey with fine lines
this product doesn't even lighten the circles by 10%
it has started to irritate my eyes to the point that my eyes water
it made my eyes burn
fine lines- which used to be barely visible- are now extremely evident on my forehead
despite religiously wearing the eye
dried my face out horribly
put just a dab on my face
it also burns my eyes horribly
your eyes will be bright red
it just sat on my skin like an oil slick
still had dry patches peeking thru
it just sat on the surface of my skin.
bumps on my right cheek
neck now have bumps
even for the eyes
wake up looking like a raccoon
it is still on my lashes after using this
eye shadows no problem
didn't burn my eyes
this literally made the skin around my eyes raw.
within minutes my face was bright red
i used a little bit on face
which just leaves my eye area super dry
i can see small closed pimples in the edge of my face
gave me so many breakouts on my nose
cheeks will never use again
i'll stick with the black tea mask by fresh.
fresh masks are normally amazing.
the black tea mask is much better
my skin is still recovering
sits on top of the skin
resulting in really shiny face
occasionally i may get one on my chin
i've always been on the oily side
crows feet which are rapidly emerging
leaves all little white lines
only this and white lucent are awful.
i didn't really notice any difference in my eye puffiness or my dark circles
more fine lines under my eyes
it burned if a tear shed or to even touch around that area
it helped with my dark circles
cover the dark circle etc
in hopes of making my dark circles less noticable
i felt a burning in my eyes after applying the cream
i tried this primarily to help with dark circles
help with dark circles
my dark circles are bad
helps a little with my dark circle
they're not only showing when i smile.
if i get any on my eyelids
it causes my eye shadow to crease
i see fine lines on my cheeks when i take selfie
fake floralbad: did nothing to address the fine lines on my forehead
i raise my eyebrows way too much
maybe a little more towards the oily side during the summer
it caused me to breakout a little on my chin
predominantly oily in the summer
i struggle with pore visibility
very faint wrinkles starting to creep in
a little on the thicker side
sort of around the apples of my cheeks
it leaves a film over the face
normally don't have rough skin
only two areas around my chin that had a bunch of little white heads under the skin
my face around my chin
first of all it burns/stings like crazy
fade past dark spots
i prefer the orange one to this one.
then finally they say to rub it off your face in little circles with the cloth
it clung to my lashes
after using this product i noticed in a 10x mirror that makeup still remained in some pores
it comes out white
way better masks out there.
still got dark spots
rough skin along with tiny red bumps all over
red itchy bumps all over with small white heads
after a week my skin became really uneven with read patches starting to develop around my nose
little red rough sensitive bumps
made my eye area itch and become very dry.
noticed my eyes watering like crazy all over my pillow
because it is way too harsh to continue use on the delicate eye area
the skin around my eyes is very different than the rest of my face
doesn't make my under eye look crepey
is too much for my eye area
many of the reviewers said it stung their eyes.
irritated them too much
also sensitive eyes beware
the skin around my eyes looked even more dry
appeared more wrinkled if possible
the skin around my eyes is finally looking normal again
there is a learning curve to get this eye cream to work
just looking crepey under my eyes
learned quickly that you only need a tiny bit under the eyes
it definitely hasn't helped with dark circles
it clumped very badly.
it was much to dry for the under eye area.
it didn't irritate my eyes
i like the cold feeling of the metal tip
while it slightly addressed my dark circles
i started to develop small bumps all over my face
it takes a little while to rub in
this is sold as a dark spot corrector
it had no effect on my dark spots
it made my skin even more red
it didn't have any effect on dark spots
it had zero effect on my dark spots
my parents both have large sunspots on their faces
didn't seem to correct dark spots
i don't normally breakout in spurts
still no difference in my dark spots
my face got bright red
would come away with several tiny "crumbles"
it might treat the dark spots
especially in dark spots
after trying clinique's dark spot corrector a couple years back
lancome's dark spot corrector made my face break out
i looked in the mirror
pimple popping up around my chin that
undereye area is less puffy in the morning
it barely dented the "armor" so to speak.
while this mask does seem to be slightly soothing to red/itchy/irritated areas
except maybe cause some bumps on my cheeks
it slightly stings my eyes
after using it for a few days i noticed dry irritated patches in the crevices of my nose
now have large flakey dry areas on my forehead
leaves a ring of oil upon anything on which it rests
struggle with dry patches
i still have dry patches
i got a lot of little forehead bumps after using this product
not only is this orange on my face
in fact my chin still had dry patches
instead it gave me red skin bumps all over my face
even down to chest area
mine was very watery
or lessen dark spots
my nose has been peeling badly using this cream
my forehead is now awash in bumpiness
the outside is very deceiving!
within 48 my forehead was flakey
it made my skin so lifeless
around my mouth began to become red
left it looking dull
this irrated my skin and stung my eyes.
my cheeks were so dry and red.
it was stinging my eyes
which are naturally dark
after using it my two cheeks had two big acnes
it makes my face look shinny
i believe it's the reasoning my cheeks have broken out
my skin turns into an oil slick that gets progressively worse throughout the day
it was too thick
even my cheek area
it also give me a a couple of small blemishes all over my face
some dark spots from previous breakouts
kind of diminishes the look of my deep forehead lines
tried using it on some dry spots on my arms
i still have the same wrinkles and dark circles.
for my small craws feet to completely disappear
also was good for dark circles
woke up to crusty eyes
other than that my eyes firm.
absolutely no plumping up of the crows feet
some very fine lines
recent icy blasts have played havoc with skin.
its hard finding an eye cream that actually helps with fine lines
my under eye area is so smooth
dark circles are gone!
forehead lines are my main concern
relatively bad expression lines along my forehead
i'll keep my fingers crossed because product is pricy
too many layers on my face using it
i didn't get the little white bumps
not too thick not too thin.
noticed that the very delicate skin under my eyes started peeling
notice that i'm getting lines on my eyelids?
and they are very visible lines.....
the area all around my mouth
maybe balled up a little bit
did not feel like it smoothed out my under eye area which was a first for an eye cream
i prefer eye cream with more cushion.
left my face flaky.
stuck with the korres wild rose sleeping facial
there is a small bit of eye makeup residue on my lower lash line
cause milia around my eyes after 3 nights of use
this sleeping mask is more like a thick night cream
cheeks were about to break out
my face stuck right to the pillow.
with dry spots on my cheeks
around my lower lip
i rub it in as the directions state
i still wake up with dry patches
just sits on skin.
caused break outs/slickness on my chin
not as severely as my cheeks
fine lines- which used to be barely visible- are now extremely evident on my forehead
despite religiously wearing the eye
in fact it makes my eyes all teary and watery.
does nothing for my dark circles
it does nothing for the bluish cast that some of us have
woke up with flakes down my cheeks
asking what the best eye cream would be for dark circles
found no difference in the darkness of my under-eye circles
i don't have the world's darkest circles
they are pretty dark
does nothing for dark circles at all
it did nothing for my dark circles
it just made my eyes watery
does nothing for dark circles-returned
it didn't minimize my dark circles
it also made my eye twitch for the first month i used it
after using the ginzing origins eye cream
brightening or dark circle reduction
only slightly reduces dark circles
insisted not only does it visibly helps with dark circles
i've always had dark circles under my eyes
this origins cream went on soft
as far as dark circles are concerned
my eyes were burning after the day of using it my skin has been peeling all around my eye
the eye cream is not heavy
liked the idea of a dark circle minimizer
then noticed all these little flesh colored bumps came out around my eyes
this eye cream made my eyes watery
my eyelids have never burned so bad.
reduction of under eye circles
my dark circles have always been pretty pronounced
which did seem to minimize the dark circles a bit
trying this mega-bright one
i've had dark circles under my eyes for as long as i can remember
i've had dark circles all my life
my eyes are very teary and it burns a lot.
there are burns under both eyes.
i gave it one star because it's hard to see my dark circles through the red
rough skin that is there now
i'd prefer to go back to the dark circles
especially in my left eye
is not effective in diminishing dark circles
don't really see a difference in my dark circles
however it does nothing for dark circles.
as for the dark circles it is supposed to minimize?
don't have dark circles as in dark/purplish tones
the corners under my eyes.
matter fact it made my dark circle go worst
the skin around my eyes are super dry
when i started noticing that my dark circles were starting to creep up again
on the opposite i noticed more uneven skin tone
i look in the mirror
my cheeks are bright red
the jar is somewhat small
after scrutinizing my skin during
just some creases by my eyes when i smile
a small one on my forehead so that could be it
breakouts appeared on both my forehead and chin.
i would wake up with my skin being more red
at first glance, there is glitter in the mask.
when i squeeze the product out of the tube i saw red clay with gold glitter on it
unsure why the gold glitter was present
because of that the mask didn't spread on my face evenly
as i was peeling the mask some parts were dried
other parts were still wet
kinda went into the line of my facial hair
my eyes were watering
always the same result: most of my pores remained clogged
i like glamglow white mud way better.
around my under-eye area
it is so prone to getting stuck in eyebrows
especially around my nose
i gravitate toward clay masks
probably because i only temporarily scared my pores into hiding
not as much on my forehead where i have a bit of oil
almost a little bit dry
it made my face grumpy the first day.
my face experienced a breakout at the eyebrow
on the side of the bridge of my nose
especially under my eyes
somehow this manages to get in my eye area
by midday my pores looked huge
it doesn't fade dark marks in the long run.
every zit i've ever had left a red mark that faded very slowly
the fact that the mask balls up
though the scars haven't vanished
yellow/orange as it originally was
made my skin break out bad in red patches that feel like alligator skin
saw the bumps disappear within 2 days
that was a little too heavy
does had a small effect of making the bags under my eyes a little less dark
have also the mask
i don't see no results with my dark circles or lifting in the eye area
did 0 for dark circles, etc.
doesn't pile up in the little wrinkles around your eyes4
dark circles - no stars.
i cannot speak to dark circles because of lack of sleep
i tended to use this product to against dryness around my eyes
it even made my eye area itch.
i woke up with puffy eyes
looked worse for wear
he also woke up with puffy eyes
my dark circles and puffiness did not go away.
i woke up with puffy eyes
it has made my dark circles worse
in fact i found myself with redder eyes
fine lines or dark circles
have started to see crepe-iness under my eyes over the last year or so
this pulled my under eye skin so tight i looked like a skeleton
my eye area becomes very dry
while the darkness has neither gotten lighter nor darker the fine lines have deepened
it also stings the eyes
dark circles were completely unchanged
at first it stings
my eyes aren't more firm
i woke up in the morning with very red cheeks
it also clogged pores on my chin which i can't say has happened for me in well over a decade
woke up in the morning with very clogged pores on my nose
a huge pimple appeared on my chin out of nowhere when it wasn't there before i did the mask
every pore on my face looked irritated
instead it was thick
probably on my neck area
my cheeks were bumpy
the fine wrinkles under my eyes seem to be more prominent
little bits of fallout are everywhere
it constantly is balling up
i used a lot of eye cream on my eye area
my eye area doesn't usually break out
other face parts that not close to my eyes
i already have my eye cream.
over my eye day cream
leaves you with raccoon eyes
it doesn't irritate my eyes
this product stung my eyes
it made my eyes sting
my forehead is now covered in small itchy bumps
they are starting to appear on my cheeks as well
it blurred my eyes so bad
first it blurred my vision instantly.
i always use it on my eyelids
it is not however gently on the eyes.
you will experience very foggy sight
stings my eyes really badly
every time i use it my vision is blurry for about an hour
i lose 3-5 eyelashes from each eye per use
3 times a charm, trying bobbi brown next.
it stings a lot and will temporarily blind you.
cloud your vision until your eye does its job
when i try to take eye makeup off it leaves a white hazy film in my eyes that temporarily blinds me
le my eyes since i've never had an issue with it making my vision blurry
after going in with numerous pumps i found a black ring around both eyes still lingered
t blurred my vision for about five minutes
if i take my eye makeup off with contacts in it makes them blurry for 30 mins
i normally don't have sensitive eyes
there were lines visible on my forehead
cheeks due to smiling/laughing
lines were still visible
only have a couple fine lines under my eyes
this product did nothing for filling in my pores or even my tiny fine lines under my eyes
hoping that it would smooth my under eye area
this did *nothing* to blur either.
usually i only have to twirl it a little bit in a cup filled with warm water
filled in the lines
gave me bumpy welts all over the rest of my face for a week
didn't sting my skin
also makes my face turn red for awhile
made my face all red
the fact that it "rolls"
some minimal fine lines
my eyes are puffy for two days
still made my eyes puffy
this dried my face a little.
make the mask turn a dark green
that fun along with a temporary tightening
it did turn from a light green to a dark green
i saw my pores get a little smaller
it turns from light green to dark green
not wildly different from the other zillions of masks out there
leaves me with a slight white cast likely because of the spf
both time the area of skin i use on has turned bright red
tone or fine lines
it made my dark circles worse
brought out the blue tones
it remained with a residue under my eyes all day long
it did a good job covering a large scar under my eye
disguise lines or help at all
the 'medium/deep' color was still relatively light
even though it creases up a bit
somewhat sits in my fine lines
the cap has two small plastic pieces in it as a stopper
this actually highlighted my puffy eyes
made my under eye area feel dry
very dark purple circles under my eyes
the peach color works well for a base layer of covering my dark circles
sits in my delicate fine lines around the eye area
i got this thinking it would help my sleepy eyes
it went right in my creases
there are only two shades
also made my undereye area look
had to keep touching up with eye cream
at 28 all i'm dealing with are darkish circles
seemed to hit all of the issues including dark circles
didn't cover anything or made my under eye area look brighter
didn't work for my very pale blue circles or minimize my fine lines under the eyes
the tint help somewhat hide under eye dark areas
doesn't cover or correct dark circles.
just gives the eyes a little lift.
at first it makes it look like it hides the dark circles
when looking in my mirror up close it looked cakey
just use my ring finger
the light one looked orange
did not cover dark circles
also settled in tiny lines.
it does get rid of dark circles though
i find it makes my under eyes appear puffy
doesn't do much for puffy or dark circles under eyes
after trying on the light shade
i still love bareminerals "stroke of light" for under eyes
the metal tip is great though!
it would just chunk up and stick to my fingers.
you will look like the hulk while wearing this mask
skin starting to look congested when i use this
in contrast the 24k gold which has may of the same claims as this mask leaves my skin bright
and who doesn't miss the dewy skin who has aged?
results: both methods made my skin react with a little red bump
just rub a tiny bit on the shoulders
the vagueness caught my attention.
my face felt so tacky that my cheek would slightly stick to the pillow case
i discover a few red bumps come out afterwards
whole middle of my face is an angry red
look like i've been sunburnt.
lately my combination skin is getting a littler more dry
some part of my skin get red
leaving it dry, red, itchy and bumpy.
super red in areas
all area are pinky and fell not normal.
itchy patches around my jaw line
one spot there is a bit of flesh visible
the bumps are smaller
for sensitive eyed folks
even the skin on my eyes were dried
however after a few days my skin became increasingly red
my face felt uncomfortably tight
somewhat itchy dry patches on both sides of my throat just under my jaw
it was too thick
i can not wear it because it is almost three shades darker than me
it was too dark
because even with the reviews saying this was a very pale shade
it was much to dark
is enough to spread over my face
this foundation is too dark
doesn't cover things like scars
it has a slight yellow tinge
it left me with little breakouts
after a while i noticed it looked orangey
it also clings onto dry patches which i rarely ever get
it doesn't provide enough coverage to wear alone because i have red blotches
one shade for all?
it left my skin with a hint of color that by the end of the day had turned the color of clay
the light to medium color is a little dark for me even in the summer
the pigment has separated or gotten darker or something
doesn't work under the eyes
it creases in my opinion.
went blotchy red after just a few minutes
i smeared it all over my face anyway
it turned it beet red from irritation
was left with a horribly bumpy
red face all day
then it kept tingling.
my face turned bright red
left my face bright red after only minutes
the effect of just dabbing it around my eyes
now my face is very red everywhere i put it
it made me skin bright red and burn so bad!
a few drops patted in is all you need
my face (esp around my mouth) became very itchy.
made the lines around my eyes look worse
this eye cream is very average
i also placed it on the bridge of my nose because i was experiencing breakouts
the first time i used it i noticed small red bumps under my eyes
because every time i used it i would get small red bumps
tiny bumps under my eyes
no effect on dark circles or fine lines.
this is important to me so that i don't over stress or tug on the delicate skin surrounding my eyes
occasionally my under eyes were a bit dry
it did nothing for my dark circles or eye bags.
make my cheeks all red
the area around my eyes where i put the cream became super red
my eyes were all puffy and dry looking.
might be a bit stickyside effects: i got a white bump by my eye
it still leaves my eye dry throughout the day
i feel like i have slimy eyelids for awhile
the skin under my eyes is all shiny from the product
(not that it was under sun light.
light lines under my eyes
just a little bit of dark circles
i even use a primer for my shadow daily
have been using forever the too faced eye shadow primer
not effective on fine lines or dark circles.
it made them puffy
it did nothing for my dark circles
hardly notice any difference aside fro my nose being smooth
i notice my dry patches developing again
had/have some crows feet concerns
i don't notice that my eyes look instantly illuminated
the dark circles under my eyes aren't super noticeable
my dark spots only got worse
my spots lightened very slightly
i applied it to just one patch of sun damage twice a day
the patch is maybe 10% lighter
i applied it just to the dark spots
it stings some when applied
the spots seemed to dry up
my dark spots became darker as expected
honestly removed like 4 black heads
the strip is white
when left your face the strip gets hard like paper mache
my pores were definitely less visible
nothing too crazy compared to the drug store nose strip
the skin on my nose was so dry for the next week that my nose got flakey
he has a thing for nose strips
the only one thing which helps me is charcoal stripes
the nose strip didn't adhere very well
do nothing for deep embedded ones
while not squeaky-clean everywhere
look noticeably smaller the next day
some of it still stuck to my skin
the dry strip works just like a biorre strip.
nose strips have never worked that well for me
it was a little disturbing to see all the little specks on the patch when you pull it off
i tried the second patch on my chin instead of my nose
still left a bunch of blackheads behind
i've tried about all the eye creams that say they help with dark circles
it's making my eyes tear
other stuff in it which is irritating to the eyes
the daytime creme burned my eyes after only one use
after a couple days my undereye area got incredibly flakey
there were actual flakes of skin coming off
there were bumps all day
crows feet stuff was minimized
my face was really red
it didn't just tingle it stung.
also it left my skin very red after.
lightly spread across my face while avoiding the eye area
it's doesn't have the strong tingling sensation that the original glamglow masks are known for
there is still a bit of a tingle though
besides leaving it soft
made my face super stiff
no stinging when applied
unlike the black glamglow mask
little bumps all over the center of my forehead
this mask is a little milkier
their pores were starting to look better
i felt some slight stinging
i prefer the white mask out of the whole line.
this mask burned my face
this stings my face so bad!!!
the black jar works much better in my opinion.
mostly just black head issues
i used the black one
red spots across my whole face
turned my skin red
within a few minutes my skin broke out everywhere in small pimples all over my face
frown lines between my brows
in the morning you're just left with little globs of stickiness all around your eyes
im 25 with not many fine lines under my eyes
the sticky feeling is still there causing the skin under my eyes to stick together
my eye area is starting to need more attention
slight bags beneath the eyes
crusty underneath when i wake in the morning
washed my face i was impressed at how soft the skin below my eyes was
nor can i speak to its ability to remove dark circles or deep wrinkles
it also left my eyes very sticky.
although sometimes i still wake up with very puffy eyes
plenty of crow feet lines
so puffy is definitely in my list of complaints
i found my sensitive contact-lense wearing eyes did not like it
it also felt as though i was a crafty preschooler that had just spread good old elmers glue all over my delicate eye area
my poor droopy eyelids actually stuck together
the "firming" was comical
de-puffing the under-eye
it feels awkward blinking for the rest of the night even when the smallest possible amount of product is used
nstead of helping my under eyes
now my under eye area was sticky
it sits under your eyes
hair sticking to my skin under my eyes where i had applied this product
it made my eye area sticky
my hair and pillow get stuck to it all night.
my eyes aren't noticeably less baggy or tighter.
the eye cream like of ball up
in the morning the skin under my eyes was a dark purple
as far as getting rid of my puffy eyes
it did not help the dark circles under my eyes or the puffiness
this made my entire eye area sticky.
i don't have dark circles
i still have puffy eyes sometimes like i've had before
i gave 3 stars because it seemed a little firmer.
put a tiny amount under eye
the sticky consistency make my eye area uncomfortable
i barely dab my finger ever so lightly into the product
i got this product to help with my under eye gags
i prefer the eye cream way more
it does de-puff eyes slightly
i could feel my eyelids are sticking together
in the last year developed slight dry patches during the colder months along my cheeks
it almost made my skin"raw" around my mouth
it left dry patches all over my face
two days later my face was covered in tiny bumps
it did not fade my dark spots at all.
it slightly bleached skin around my dark/sun/age sports
no changes to the dark spots at all.
the spots are still there
left somewhat of a film on top of my skin
it made my eyes water
it make my face turn bright red
more on the oily side
covered in tiny little bumps
fine lines as well as lighten dark spots
neck have broken out in little hard bumps
it did help brighten up my dark circles
so once again i'm on the hunt for an eye cream that will help reduce the lines under my eyes
brown spots where i've not had any
eye cream in the set
some red bumps under my eyebrow like some of the other reviewers
little lines under eyes
it hasn't done anything for the dark spots on my skin
i also believe it may be the culprit of a few itchy bumps on the side of my cheeks
i still had raccoon eye from my eye make up.
i've never been a big bobbi brown fan
my eyes look no different at all
i rubbed it on my face
my forehead is covered in small bumps after using it only for 2 times
second, this irritated my eyes like crazy.
my eyes would be red
bought this for my semi-dark under eye circles.
my under eye circles aren't getting worse either
made my eyes look worse
it really stings my eyes every time i put it on
i get a really bad burning sensation from this eye cream
smooth a few fine lines i have
i mainly used it for my under eye circles
a lot of tingling around my eye area
i went back to the regular korres oak eye cream
my eyes were puffier than before
it also smoothed the fine lines under my eyes.
so far i do love the other two black pine products
it balls up something fierce under makeup
i feel like it accentuated the lines on my forehead
the scent lingered on my fingers afterward
though i have thin
it didn't turn red
had dry patches on my forehead
other than my face looked a little red after application
has been burning as though badly sunburned in the 2 hours since
it was still red
woke up the next day with red splotches on my previously clear face
squeezed it on my fingers
occasionally get one or two breakouts on my chin when it's that time of the month
it caused a few bumps on my face
fine lines are wrinkled for the price i expected to see much more than softness
looked in the mirror
my skin looked like the desert
my eyelids were red
it seemed a little thick
at the same time sting my eyes
its just not for me mostly due to the eye sting
it caused my face to break out in little red bumps
this mask doesn't have directions
they were smoothing out thanks to tatcha indigo
following its use, my chapped areas are worse!
it's very unpleasant to have near your nose
then a big pimple showed up on my forehead
especially around the eyes
burn só badly my eyes
its a bit on the oily side
no matter how much i rubbed it just smeared around my eyes
this has a weird texture that is not absorbed into the eye area easily
with the appearance of more fine lines
especially for an eye cream
this is a very thick cream-- i had to rub a little between my fingers before applying in order to get it to spread nicely
i used the entire container waiting to see any difference underneath my eyes
the skin around my eyes still feel tight
the few times i've gotten it into my waterline i've never felt any stinging
she said that my eyes looked "unusually small"
after looking in the mirror
i noticed that the skin around my eyes was pulled so tight i looked like i was perpetually squinting
so, does this tighten the skin around the eyes?
it made the whole area around my eye red
rritated the eyes themselves though i didn't get the cream too close to my actual eye
it still made my eyes burn
so even the area under/around my eyes can develop tiny bumps with the wrong eye cream
made my eyes water like crazy
noticed some white bumps forming under my eyes
made the skin below my under eyes breakout.
i tend to get it in my eyes
they felt cloudy from the oil
it's a little thick to wear in the morning
i love that this pair leaves my face less red
however it easily gets into your eyes which causes them to blur your vision
make your surroundings appear to be in a cloud of smoke
had to rub the product harder on the eye area which was very harsh on the skin
there is still a lot of makeup left on the cotton pad
though it's normal for me to have the odd small pimple on my chin
i rubbed it in my face
water is still left beady?
it unfortunately left me with breakouts on both of my cheeks
see no difference in my dark circles or fine lines
maybe a little bit or my dark circles going away
stinging in my eyes
i've spotted new milia forming
my dark circles are still here
my main concern is keeping the eye area hydrated since i have dark circles
it burned the area around my eyes
it actually made the skin around my eyes look worst
my eye area became too dry
my dark circles are constant
not on my cheeks
caused my foundation to be patchy
it really lightened some sun spots
the darker spots are emphasized
my pore looked enormous
it has very whisper thin consistency
what i got is bumps under my skin
the those bumps were really bad
my nose area was a little dry one night
but it didn't diminish my dark spots at all!
purple glitter which is readily visible in natural light--- no thanks
i suddenly got more breakouts
maybe it brighten up my face
didn't really fade my dark spots not even the little ones
i do see some fading
the deeper the scar, the longer it seems to fade.
dark spots around my mouth
my spots are darker than ever before with a very dry skin
doesnt work for my dark circles
i often have white cast on my fingers
some parts of the eyes
yes have a few lines in the lower bag area
t's very difficult to squeeze out
only have the beginning of crows feet
some crinkle lines on either side of my nose
patchy on my cheek area
alone concentrated serum to power punch dark circles
i woke up with more blemishes
after using this i noticed little powdery patches on my face where it dried
putting on even the tiniest bit of makeup was a nightmare
which were all glowing
my skin instantly got red
skins been significantly dried out lately
i just started the needles no more
left just a bit of an oily sheen on my face
it made my scars appear darker
i started forming bumps
it caused some extreme dark dry patches on my skin
my pores were noticeably less congested
white bumps right where i was applying this serum
white heads were all gone
with this product i find myself tugging at my eyes
it stings my eyelids even though it does not get in my eyes
then stung my eyes like crazy when i tried to get the black mascara circles off my face
it made my eyes burn
irritated my eyes terribly
eyes got very swollen
my face is covered in bumps
so seeing my skin literally covered is a little terrifying
by the last use my skin had completely broken out with texture all over my cheeks
under my eyes right up to my lower lash line
all over my forehead
it did firm up my cheeks
after using it one night i woke with little bumps all over my cheeks
not all over my pillow
especially around the chin area
unlike this promising overnight mask
i also didn't like the feeling of my face sticking to my pillow
noticed i had small break outs around my cheeks
the foil was large enough to use 2 nights in a row
a few of the other nighttime masks
i got red bumps all over my face
still trying to get rid of the bumps :
it felt really heavy and thick on my face.
after a day tiny red bumps started appearing all over my skin
was using it on my smile lines
around my eyes which are not pronounced
i only have a few fine lines on my forehead in my mid-40's
it probably works on younger skin that doesn't have deeper wrinkles or lines
especially to get rid of my forehead lines
this only made my horizontal forehead lines more pronounced
or my expression lines are too deeply imbedded
pull around the delicate skin of my eyes
i am 28 with faint lines by my mouth
the problem with this is its in a dark bottle
i'll stick with my algenist genius eye cream.
the beginning of deep wrinkles in between my eyebrows
it left my eyes dry.
happen to rub under my eyes afterward
i think i see a tiny bit of temporary fine wrinkle smoothing after i put it on
i prefer "crease relief" leaps
i saw considerable softening of some fine lines on my forehead
some minor softening of smile lines no change in frown lines
i did like the improved appearance to my neck/chest
i can honestly say there is no reduction in my minimal forehead lines or crows feet
the lines seem temporarily slightly softened
after two weeks i noticed flakes on my nose as if it was drying it out too much
after the second use i had red dry patches of different sizes all over my face
also all of these little bumps which close up are white heads
soon after the flakiness on my nose
falling in love with the glamglow masks
i eventually developed really bad patches of breakouts directly in the middle of both sides of my cheeks
more so just swishing some product on my face with water
cheeks i stopped using it
not as good as hourglass
not as effective when removing the eye liner which i draw on my upper waterline
without leaving residue or affecting my eyes
my sun spots more obvious
leaving it looking red
more toward the oily side
for me that is on the uncomfortable side
in my dry spots
noticed my entire forhead
my skin is starting to dry out on my chin
also burned my skin a bit
causing ghost face when using the same amount i usually do
this product caused me to have the worst forehead
i don't want to be walking around with flakes still left in my hair
i think my nose is the driest part on my face
causes it to be red
even that is a stretch
's eye cream in the past with good results
it has literally burned the skin around my eyes
the product was terrible for my skin to the point that it dried out the skin surrounding my eyes so badly that it has cracked
is light/refreshing around the eyes
made my eye bags worse.
not even lightening of the dark circles i get after long nights
still have dark circles
'm still on the hunt for a nice eye cream
my dark circles are slightly lighter
of eye cream to something more intense
both times it made my eyes watery
my undereye area is a little sunken
got the idea to use it on my chronically chapped lips
so 3 stars as an eye cream, 5 as a lip balm.
i subtly started to notice that it looked like the bags under my eyes were fuller
the area under my eyes we're swollen
i started developing dry flaky spots after just 5 or 6 uses
i woke up with eyeliner smudged all over my eyes.
it left the worst thick oil layer on my face
after using it for around a week i noticed i started to get milia bumps all on my forehead
i would get little bumps all over my chin
i noticed these tiny bumps along my jawline near my chin
my skin is normally quite clear aside from a few breakouts around my time of the month
when my bumpy friends became permanent fixtures on my face
only that my hairline is greasier in the morning when i use it
left it looking bright
it caused so much damage it have to wave the white flag
few small lines on my forehead
getting tiny white bumps
i got the smaller version of this from the night bright kit
small white bumps on the face
couldn't get rid of these small red bumps
i also noticed little bumps that have appeared on my forehead
in turn, my skin gets red and irritated.
i developed red bumps all along my jaw line
especially around the t-zone
noticed that my face was stinging in that spot
the scrubby fibres in this really irritated my skin
this left dry patches around my mouth
begins to dry out my cheek areas
not on eye area
the next morning woke up with a huge cluster of whiteheads on my cheek
only in the area between my nose
i started to get tiny bumps all over my face
by the 2nd morning i had tiny white bumps all over my highlight area below my undereye area
left a rough white film on my face that took days to peel
i rotate between not wearing make up
overtime the skin under my eyes have become very soft
used daily for about a month on my dark undereye circles
i didn't saw any difference on my puffs or dark circles at all
you are literally rubbing the skin around your eyes
if you are serious about eye de puffing
this product made my eyes irritated
it's too pointy for the delicate eye area
it creased in the fine lines under my eyes
the little iron head caught my eye
left my skin under my eyes puffy
it made my eye area look grey
which made my eyes water
i personally like the metal under my eyes for the cooling sensation
my eyes are usually quite puffy in the morning.
i did not expect this to cover the darkness around my eyes
has zero coverage of dark circles under my eyes
the puff off eye cream was just such a disappointment in comparison
looks like i'm stuck with it
the short story for my eyes is that i have two very distinct lines/folds/creases
i think this is best for people with little under eye creasing
for us girls with deep creases under the eye i dont recommend
the metal tip isn't very eye friendly
oddly shaped it's easy to poke your eye
doesn't really hide or decrease my puffy eyes
i got my eyebrows done at the benefit brow bar in sephora
it was starting to irritate my eyes
cover my generically under eye rings
to conceal dark circles there are other better products than this one
this eye cream is terrible.
made my under eye makeup crease throughout the day
it makes my already red skin even redder
leaving it very tight
it burned my eyes horribly
i noticed my skin was getting a few dry patches
little balls of the serum would roll off on my fingers
leaving your skin looking slightly blurred
cake in some areas around my nose
i love the pink rose stem cell one though it is amazing to wear over night
also really like the pumpkin one
the first two times i wore this i received 2 red acne spots on my face
the mask irritated my face
i did notice my lines around my neck to soften
except for my nose where i also have large pores
put this mask all over my face except for my nose where i apply the origins charcoal mask
it does leave some teeny little gold flecks on your skin
pretty in the jar
it bothered my eyes
i still covered my whole face
this barely made me tingle
started to feel some warmth almost like my face was getting close to a campfire around my cheeks
my cheeks were bright red
a little bit dried out
my face is visibly red in only the spots where the mask was located
i felt my face getting hotter then a burning sensation
stays bright red for a few hours
as it left a dingy grey-black residue on my face
it left my face red
it unfortunately made my 47 year old skin look even more tired by accentuation sagging
short-lived glow to your skin
after using i have dry patches on my face.
wrinkles around my mouth after 3 days of using it
which sometimes makes my the fine wrinkles around my mouth
when i woke up my skin was bright red
avoid eye area and lips.
thought the lines around my eyes looked so much better
the skin around my nose actually cracked open
felt that my crows feet were more pronounced
i can see my dark circles fade a little
dark circles are still visible
dark circles did fade a tiny bit
this eye cream burns like crazy for at least 5 mins post-application
has promises helping with hereditary dark circles
i asked the consultant at sephora what would help with my dark circles under my eyes
make my under eye area dry
for dark circles under eyes
reduce appearance of dark circles
it dried out my eye area.
i hated the little beads that were in it
it does nothing for my genetically dark under eye circles
the drugstore miracle blur for under your eyes does a much better job
have looked for products to reduce my dark undereye circles since i was a teen
leaves white film under my eyes when i put it
im struggling with our dark circles for many years
tried different eye cream
a little bit reduce my dark circle
it really stings when under the eye
i expected my dark circles to be almost completely gone
it only lightened them slightly
stung my sensitve under eye area
never saw any lightening of the dark circles
it left a white film on my eyes
those little dots in the product were all around my eyes
it only made my under eye area red
it was also quite difficult to remove the white film it left
it dried my eye area to the point that i saw creases
made my dark circles more evident
i've tried many eye creams that claim to get ride of under eye circles
what's with the stupid silver beads that just leave gray smears under you eyes?
considering dark circles was the main issue
this product did nothing for the dark circles under my eyes
it stings my skin sometimes for some odd reason
it also did nothing for my dark circles.
for anyone with genetic dark circles
it really irritated my eyes
i felt stinging on the skin around my eyes
fine lines are still very visible
i've used the cream at least 2x a day with no visible sign of reduction to my dark circles
i didn't notice any visible difference in the laugh lines around my eyes or dark circles either
definitely tightens the skin around my eyes
does nth to dark circles or fine lines
the dark circle is still very noticeable.
the circles are definitely not as dark
scaly patches on my nose
i like this for about a weekuntil i started getting dry patches all over chin
flaky patches all over my face
a lot of bumps started to apear on my skin
i noticed it was burning my skin in the area from under my nose to jaw
is peeling in several places
10 minutes after use my face was incredibly blotchy
from now on i'm sticking to amorepacific/more gentle br
it's a very thin crack
i woke up the next morning to little bumps all over my chin
it almost felt like scales.
the problem came in the form of whiteheads that popped up around my eyes
the side of my nose
my upper lip is completely flaky
only some dry areas around my tzone
night creamy mask on the areas to get back to normal
along with the mask
i got little bumps around my cheeks
slightly down my neck
my cheeks started turning red
i figured i might've been a little too rough with how i rubbed my face
this gave me dry scaly patches around my eyes
i woke up one day with deep wrinkles under my eyes
or general appearance under the eyes
my under eyes look greasy
i felt that this eye cream was a bit on the heavy side
i think some of the product spreads to the cheek area while sleeping
at first, this eye cream goes on smoothly.
it sits on top of my under-eye area
at least it seems to fade.
this made me break out with little bumps under my eye
it has done nothing for my dark circles or fine lines
i sometimes also use it on my lips
i tend to get puffy underneath my eyes
it just sits on my skin.
it tingles when i put it on
my under eyes are bone dry by mid-day
i've even developed a strange dry patch in the corner of one eye
not with dark circles
i still had tired and puffy eyes.
left my eye flakey
i didn't feel like this product brightened my under eye circles
have several of their masks
it did absolutely nothing for my dark under eye circles or help at concealing signs of fatigue or puffiness
ended up with angry red blotches on my cheeks
whitehead like bumps the next morning
my pores seem more congested than usual
i normally shy away from heavily scented products for my face
works fine in a pinch
the oil inside turned murky
ok this thing is responsible for causing a wrinkle under my left eye
it caused a bad irritation precisely under my eyes
i found that it burned my eyes or even my skin around my eyes
thought great its clearing out my skin bringing some blemishes to the surface
except for the fact that it was just too dark since i'm literally the fairest shade in the word
awful, at least for the pale girls out there.
so don't apply to dark uneven areas of skin
then red bumps all over my chin
it was still too shiny
when blended between my fingers i could see orange
it turned my fair skin quite tan within 30 seconds
my skin became much more oil filled
this made my neck
even on my neck
broke me out in small white bumps
it stung the skin around my nose
tchy that my nose became quite red
the area of hyper pigmentation around my eyes has lessened a bit
no difference in dark spots
it causes my makeup to become noticeably splotchy
the orange color was also an issue as it got all over my clarisonic
has a cloud-like appearance
which disappears as it makes small popping noises
they have little bumps on the back
even across my oily t-zone area
black heads on my nose
my chin literally had so many pimples i couldn't count
small glitter all over the face
the older one had more of an opal effect that gave your skin this inner glow when applied
as my skin tended to break out
just needed some "glow
i noticed a few white heads had appeared
i notice my pores were getting larger
blackheads starting popping out of nowhere in ridiculous size
their very light my pores are still big
also with several tiny pimple like bumps on my face which were not there the night before
it beaks me out every time i use it
not particularly easily impressed with every product that crosses my skin care bag
it sits on top of the skin
sits atop the skin way too long
i see now difference in my dark circles
i didnt noticed any change to under eye dark circles or wrinkles
it creases under my eye
still have the fine lines
the under eye skin looks the same
it seriously looks like dots
it also left a little bit of a white color behind
it sits on top of my skin
leaves patches that are still dry/flaky
within a day or two it caused little red bumps all over my face
it left me shiny
when using my eyes became red
doesn't help with dark circles.
all i know is my eyes look puffy
puffy was never a problem for me before.
my eye area looks
been using this eye cream for awhile now
got this for my dry eye spots.
makes the skin around my eyes sting
the lines under my eyes
still have fine lines
this eye cream is on the heavy side.
for some reason heavy eye creams of this kind tends to make my eyes watery
all it did was make my eyes puffy
this puffed my eyes all up
eyes look somewhat dry with makeup on.
the first time i used this eye cream it made my eyelids really hot
my eyes got really watery
my eyelids got really red
i've had issues with this along with one other eye cream in the past
it made the skin around the eye area warm
also made my eyes burn
unfortunately every morning when i wake up my eyes feel puffy
when i wake up in the morning my eyes are so crusty
start furiously rubbing my eyes because they're basically crusted shut which i feel like defeats the purpose of the product
balls up under the eye
it gave me white bumps all over my face
fine lines around my eyes
plus dark patches on my cheeks in the summer
the two products seem plump
looking like the hulk rolled in olive oil
it actually made my forehead
nose bridge kind of flakey/scaley
i think it did help soften some of the lines on my forehead
left my face red
i saw some spot fading pretty quickly
i didnt expect the oil to be a deep teal
tiny fine lines starting to show
it does help with the fine lines on my upper lip
it was just as equally red
to having even more dullness
there were red patches on my cheeks
especially as it turns colder
now i have peeling skin all over my chin
my cheeks actually look pretty clear right now
it did nothing but make my face red and itchy.
i've always found it so thick
made my cheek splotchy
it's a great sun screen on its own
while pale enough for me
i end up with little balls or specks of makeup
i put on about more than a light layer
i tried applying with both fingers
the good: on parts of my face this was smooth
i found it a little heavy
the biggest problem for me is that it pilled up around the edges of my face
the added sheen to my eyelids wasn't bad at all.
my oily areas remained the same
across my nose under my glasses so that when i rub my finger in that area
just a little bit on my cheeks
my pores appeared the same:big and ugly.
i now dip the ball in my other eye products
no real wrinkles or dark circles
i think my eye bag looks worse
hoping it would be my holy grail eye cream
it made my dark circles
tight when i normally have regular skin
i will definitely get little bumps all over my skin
i ended up with small red bumps all over my chin
this past winter left my skin drier than usual
this left a strange film on my skin
this face wash made tiny little bumps appear all over my cheeks
my cheeks are patchy
the rest of my face was still shinier than usual
even after blotting, i was still shiny.
by the evening i had what seemed like hundreds of small pimples across forehead
along the side of my face
the bumps have disappeared
except for a small portion on my forehead
i could literally get it under my fingernail if i scraped my cheek
and i put the finest layer on my face.
after an hour, the dry patches were visible.
i feel like this cream is too rich for me that it gave me a tiny white bumps under my eyes
now i only use this on my neck or dry spots on my nose
i began seeing lines/creases under my eyes after one week
i wish that it did more to diminish my dark eye circles
will keep searching for my holy grail eye cream
it made my dark circles worse.
under eye areas are extremely thin
it made my dark circles even darker
very light for a sleeping cream
the spots are not terrible
as a brightening mask it literally did nothing
i also see a couple small bumps around the sides of my nose
none of them have faded
small bumps on my face every other night
belif eye cream which i like more
my neck never looked as awful
fine lines still there.
**to those who're complaining that it didn't do squat to help dark circles
did absolutely nothing for dark circles
somewhat plumps out the crows feet
after about a week of use the skin on my eyelids
under eye area began to flake
nothing bad with this eye cream
still found my eyes to get dry
the fine lines under my eyes
around the inner corner
due to 10+years of tugging from using contacts
it dried out the skin under my eyes severely.
it did decrease the look of wrinkles around the corners of my eyes
they are still flaky
doesn't do much for dark circles or fine lines
honestly cannot see much of a difference with my dark circles or puffiness
have two fine lines under my eyes
have two lines underneath my eyes
my dark circles are still very dark
my dark circles are still dark purple
this basically has glitter in it.
a warning that it does have glitter
pair that up with more breakouts
i look in the mirror
the glitter that's on my face just ruins everything
noticeable glitter on face.
thinking it was going to add a lot of ugly sparkle to my face
its not big chunks of glitter or anything
now i have little bumps all over my face
i've noticed that i have started to get little white bumps all over my face
specifically in the triangular area under my eyes
each time my skin had red splotches
the mud, on the other hand, was underwhelming.
i noticed my skin becoming red around my nose
my oily skin started to break out gradually until i literally had pimples everywhere
the blue one the next
made my face flakey!
with a little powder on top
it also clings to every little dry spot
it leaves a white cast
i can't get past the white cast it leaves on my face
flaking toward mid-end of the day
the upside is that it is not one tiny bit greasy
it made my face look really white compared to my neck
by the end of the day i already had zits forming around my chin area
by the time i washed it off my face was covered in little red bumps
it's impossible to rub in without leaving a white
verging on oily on my forehead sometimes
this leaves a horrible white cast
i didn't mind the consistency or the white cast it left
this mousturizer if fairly thick
i didn't notice much of a white cast
the fact that it leaves a white cast at first
a few mins after applying i began to notice that it started "melting" above my cupids bow
had little bumps on my skin
kept leaving gross white flakes
kept leaving a white film/cast
was really messy along the hair line
the product left a noticeable white veil on my face
left my face completely white
the white cast disappears pretty quick
left a thick white cast
i then had to use a foundation too dark for me to offset the white cast
was covered in white
left a rather noticeable white cast
there were clumps of it all over my face
my eyes have been watering since i removed the mask
i felt like fully 1/3 of it clumped
it had these wierd little clumps that wouldn't stick to my face
get in my eyes
my face is completely red
with glowing reviews to top it all off
as i could tell by the black smudges under my eye
one for the eyes
usually only around my eyes
my face turned pink
i started to notice that my skin was peeling around my forehead
this mask feels like bugs crawling on your face
during that time my skin was bubbling
i liked the bubble action on the skin
especially around my mouth
just left it slightly softer
is hard to spread on the face
i tried this mask as my face was looking very dull
my pores were mostly clear
the black heads and white heads are still there.
very red skin after that.
now i only use it on my nose
the next day i got a whole bunch of small pimples
which often has flaky patches
on the dry side
i found that it leaves a white cast
made my dry patches worse
this one is black
the emergency mask was white
it's definitely on the heavier side.
your face will still be a bit shiny
it lingers on all day
my face was red
very rarely a pimple in sight
i immediately felt huge dry patches on my cheeks
especially below my eyes
some mornings it left my cheeks with dry patches
will leave your vision foggy because of the oil
my cotton ball had lots of makeup on it.
have always had skin like iron
rubbing it in some more
but this eye cream did nothing for my aging eyes.
little dried area around
it made my skin look older when i wore it
no difference in dark circles or fine lines.
definitely with creases under my eyes
my stick is on the softer side
i eventually got a small rough patch of skin on my forehead
apparently used too much pressure because the stick eroded
stuck my finger in
however love the black mask.
it really did a number on my lip and mouth area.
so definitely do not twist more than a teeny tiny little bit out of the tube each time
made my eyes water
it firms up my chin area nicely
when it's squired onto my fingers
throughout the day i could see little tiny pimples forming all over my forehead
have your face red with a sharp line marking where you didn't apply the mask
dry patches started to appear.
i rarely get a blemish
i bit the bullet
this mask has totally obliterated a lot of the spots
after using it for the 3 days in a row i got tiny micro bumps all over my forehead
my face became super red
white are all good
my skin broke out in small micro bumps-
kinda dry in spots
the grit was everywhere
falls if you make any facial expressions
she's making a different face in each picture.
definitely evens skin tone after a few weeks
the pores around my nose looked a little smaller for about 3 hours after i washed the mask off
would've been better without all the little chunks
during the day it makes my eye shadow look really bad
just sits on top of my skin
i noticed after 3-5 days of use my pores got super congested
with some dry patches
it still irritated my eyes
i noticed some of more pores were getting clogged
a thin strip down the center of my forehead during dry weather
my forehead has still been pretty oily by midday
my forehead is shiny by lunch
i end up with raccoon eyes
dirt still on my face
even after a lot of massaging the makeup loose
however since purchasing it i noticed my pores on my nose are now clogged
this gave me large breakouts along with small bumps all over my face
not for someone like me with dark circles
it does not remove dark circles not even light in it
sits on top of your skin forever
my dark circles around my eyes feel worst.
there isn't any difference with my eyes except the dark circles still appearing
it made my dark circles worse
as i don't really suffer from dark circles
i get milia very easily around my eyes.
i woke up with puffy eyes
fell in love with the bio correcting eye creme after a deluxe sample was the first thing to clear the dark circles under my eyes in years
it was stinging my eyes
soooo much skin damaging alcohol around the eye area
no change in dark spots
after use i notice a white cast to my face that looks a bit ghostly
i am all about brightening masks
crack like some masks
such as around the mouth
t's hard to smooth it over the face fast enough
by week two my eyes were very smooth
as far as wrinkled i'm lucky in that area this far
for erasing those teeny bumps i'm afraid to not use it now
actally a little more lines
this eye treatment caused my under eye area to become red
around my eyes were red, tight, and itchy.
it made my eyes constantly water.
it sits on top of my skin
sort of peely on my nose
the eye laser is not for me.
it only left a faint pinkness for 30 minutes or so
it looked like i had slash marks on my cheekbones
can see 4 white/red bumps all in a row
i just hope these bumps heal
my under eye wrinkles are very close to my waterline
if you aren't sensitive to cones
rather than something thicker
she kept putting more on loll.
with in one application my cheeks were soothed
my fingers would literally
they were small areas of patchy
gradually caused me to get little white bumps under my eyes
this eye cream stings my eyes beyond belief i am going to try to return it to sephora
also be cautious to apply only to the eye orbit because it stings terribly if it gets in your eyes
it has literally done nothing for my eyes/ under-eye bags
unfortunately this balm stung when i used it
it was rusty-looking
this made my skin sting a lot
my dry patches were still noticeable
definitely stings when applied over any blemished
this product is sticky and made my face sting.
left little bumps on certain parts of my skin
after about a week of using this i got a small dry patch around my nose
small bumps cover my cheek area
later on in the night i realized some small red bumps on my skin
some dry patches too
it just sits on top of my skin
my skin turned red
within 5 minutes my skin was covered in little goose pimples
so many visible dry patches.
gave this product three stars because it stays sticky under the eye
i didn't like it on my eyelids
it made the makeup around my eyes look super patchy
i expect more from my eye cream.
made my eye area feel tacky
it stung my eye
kind of made my eyes sting--this hasn't happened to me with any other eye cream
dry my under eye skin looked
creases appear more prominent because it gathers under the eyes
makes under eye area softer
if you get it too close to your eyelashes or lower eyelid
my hunt for a good eye cream continues.
it stings a little bit
i don't usually have dark circles around my eyes
i wake up with dark circles
it felt like a good eye balm until i started noticing the skin around my eyes changing
this eye cream made my eyes sting!
skin around my eyes was dry
my eyes continually got worse
the dark circles are nearly gone
or help my dark circles at all
it made my eyes look worse
my main concern for buying was for dark circles
dark circles or tone at all
around the eyes is very dry
this eye cream is too light.
it seems like smoothens the eye area
if i rub my eyes
some lines under my eyes
still have my dark circles, but less puffiness.
my eyes have been feeling dry after using this eye balm for 2 weeks
made the skin below my eyes dry
like i can rub my finger across the area it's applied
i still had some dry patches on my forehead
the cream is too heavy
immortelle precious cream was off shelves for awhile
it also caused my skin to generate these strange under skin bumps
my face is red, stinging and dried out.
the fine lines on my forehead
near my cheeks didn't look any less noticeable
after two uses it left my cheeks red
bumpy after using the product
instead i saw red patches on my face
curious about the other two masks.
consistency of the mask reminds me of crushed chalk mixed with a bit of water
the green clay is my favorite of the three.
made my cheeks red
it left my cheeks stinging so won't be using white at all
the green and pink were both awesome.
the only reason i'm not giving this 5 stars is the calming white
including the pink one
especially that green one
following that it caused lots of peeling
i broke out in tiny little zits
and i don't even have deep lines!
pads were too dry
t-zone being the most oily spots on my face
i could see the sheen right away
it unfortunately amplified the oiliness on my face too much
soon after my cheeks were red
the mask doesn't come with the brush as pictured
the eye cream has shimmer in it although it's only visible upon closer inspection
sometimes around my eyes
especially around my nose my cheeks
just some pink around my nose, cheeks & forehead.
my cheeks became more sensitive to getting red from temperature changes
cuts the life of a jar of this stuff in half!
if you already have spider veins or just minimal
my veins even more visible
aside for the occasional breakout my skin is clear
saw no difference in crows feet or skin tone
i don't have really dark circles or pronounced puffiness to begin with
the pump certainly was shiny
it is definitely balling up
leaving little chunks all over my face
i woke up to peely flaky skin
woke up to no less than a dozen zits today
the mask burned slightly
left my face red like a peel
a couple of them are definite staples in my bathroom
come off in little lumps
it immediately starts coming off of my skin in little flakes
forms nasty little gray balls of yuck
sat funny on the skin
i noticed little white balls all over my skin
this balled up into little bits
it balled up when i applied makeup which belies its name rise 'n shine
skin still look flaky around my checks
for years i've been in the habit of applying a tiny amount of face cream on my lips
i also noticed that my bite lipsticks staying power was slightly increased
no balling up no peeling.
it has helped my dry skin around my nose
after a couple days of using it i noticed i was getting dry patches on my skin as well
yes its a little thick
this cream was way too thick
it was so thick
i still noticed faint white streaks sitting on top of my skin
there are bunch of flakes coming out
plus it caused my makeup to ball up into little weird flakes
maybe it lightens spots when more than one bottle is used
it did lighten my spots somewhat
one in every cheeks
started getting red itchy bumps on the side of my face where i put most of the product since that's where my dark spots were
smooth skin with a few hyperpigmention spots here
helps to very minimally blur some fine lines
err more on the dry side
the dryness has mostly gone away
using it up on my neck and chest.
it will leave a blue residue on my face
i've found that lapis rivals them both
my face has small breakouts all over
it is not blue
my oil is a dark brown
i'd suggest going with the blue tansy mask by them
gemstones settle at bottom even when you stir
so much so that i bit the bullet
did nothing to fade scars or dark spots or brighten my skin tone
feels a little bit tingle at first five minutes
just continues to remain slippery
the blue has turned blue-green
lately more so dry
cause a dry spot in my nose to get worse
might as well stick with the glow tonic
left my under-eye area dry
especially around my sensitive-to-everything eyes
it never helped with dark circles
i mainly purchased this for reducing darkness under my eyes
tapping lightly with your ring finger
l need an eye cream that helps depuff the bags under my eyes
correct my dark circles
it's peeling below my eyes too
this eye cream made my eyes puffy
when i applied under my eyes it made my cheek bones a little too puffy looking
did nothing for my dark circles
there's always a lot of empty space in the container
does nothing for fine lines and darkness.
didn't brighten up the eye area at all.
this eye cream did nothing for my dark circles or eye zone
sadly disappointed in this eye cream.
it made my eyelids sting
turn red like no other
the top is tapered
the eye cream left my under eyes dry
i could feel the tightness in the skin around my eyes
i love droppers with squeeze tops.
is tiny bit sticky
it lingers all day
i noticed that i was getting some majorly clogged pores
it also turned my hands orange.
my face was orange
my fingers were orange
had an orange cast
after 2 days of using it i have small white headed acne on my cheeks
i feel i become darker at the end of the day
it took awhile to realize that this was the culprit of weird texture on my forehead
glowy after just two use
i am noticeably darker on the area i applied
it made my face feel uncomfortably hot
my dark spot is still not fading.
could be toned down
keep in mind that this is a mild
they are just mouse.......
feels like little bugs crawling on my face.
my dry patches were almost gone
a bit on the expensive side
around my nose are so dry
i don't have dark circles
every time i applied eye makeup i would notice how the corners of my eyes had these tight dry-skin "pull lines" which hadn't been there before when i was using no eye cream
i don't have a ton of wrinkles near my eyes
i didn't find that this did a lot for the dark circles or the puffiness
it also didn't irritate my eyes at all.
i'd never used an eye cream before
easy to apply around the eyes.
found no improvement with the saggy skin around my eyes
shelled out the $62 for this eye balm
i feel like my under eyes appear puffier than usual
my eyelids looked a bit sunken in
by the end of the day my eye area looked more wrinkled as a result
i still have my lines under my eyes
dark circles are still visible
used it on my face mainly on my jaw down to my neck
have your spots removed that way
not so good on dark sports or sun spots
some darker spots from previous sun damage have started to appear
then that defiant little age spot on my cheek was baaaaack
it made my neck a little darker
it didn't improve my dark spots.
if anything, the area is darker.
not one bit of fading.
my dark spots from acne or spots i got from the sun aren't going away at all
i am a 52 year old with some dark spots on my neck
keep waiting for some of the dark spots to lighten
the product made my spots darker
it lightened the rest of my face
not the scars so my scars are even more prominent now
it may be good for light sun spots
my blackspots have not gone away on my face
above my top lip
has now caused dark spots to appear on my cheeks
my dark spots are still there
lightened my spots slightly
it gave me so many little pimples around my cheek area because that's where my dark marks are
avoid like the plague!!
although i had no intent to fade away my light freckles
almost unnoticeable difference on my sun spots
perhaps even the darkening of my spots
the spots just get darker
the sun these days is unforgiving :
on 2 small spots one on my face
my dark spots are still the exact same
they have faded very slightly
i noticed some tiny tears
sadly this product caused me to have terribly dry irritated skin all throughout my forehead
i actually woke up with swollen eyes today because of it
your skin will turn red
my face got red blotches all over it
first i noticed that my eyes were all blurry like the oil somehow got into my eyes
my eyesight is foggy from make up
especially in the eye area
the next morning all of the little bumps on the side of my face were gone
i noticed it would give me small red bumps on my forehead
patchy skin in only a 3 day span
had little red dots all over
those little dots had turned into acne spots i had never had before
my skin just flared up bright red
mostly breakout in chin
not much of a cheek break-out-er
then it started to dry my skin out i started to have dry white spots on my cheeks
literally every day i have new pimple
it became red like bright red in some areas
i actually think my smile lines are worse?
only applying a tiny amount to crows feet
it is just a temporary film on the surface of the skin that temporarily might make wrinkles look softer
every time i used it i would break out with small little pimples on my chin
almost like smearing a light vasoline over my face
this is very grainy which makes it questionable to use every day especially around the eyes
it tends to get in my hairline even with using a headb
there was a lot of dirt
mine seemed to have gritty bits in it
i really enjoyed breathing in with the warm cloth over my face
it does nothing for dark circles or fine line
it broke me out in red bumps that look almost like insect bites under my eyes
my skin was super parched after having a stomach bug
my cheeks particularly started peeling
lifting caudalie words are eye catching because it's the trendy words in beauty products right now
other then a little bit of firmness
there's yellow residue still on there
it just sits on top of the skin
when mixed with water only slightly changes into a milky consistency
