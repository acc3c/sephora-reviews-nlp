but it isn't great.
it smells quite good.
too bad because it's a great product
decided to purchase this moisturizer since it has great reviews
the fragrance is good
this is just a mediocre product to me
it leaves this weird film on your skin that is terrible for priming- foundation tends to ball up
that smooth application is great
it takes a lot for it to actually do a solid job
the ingredients are just horrible!
dimethicone is a horrible ingredient
also great for touch ups
feels good on the skin
my skin looks terrible
not a terrible travel option
the idea behind this is awesome
this moisturizer feels nice on the face
i went to sephora for good moisturizer
it was horrible over powder foundation
it is nothing spectacular
it has a strong smell

not good for a day cream.
the product itself is excellent.
maybe it will be a wonderful product for you.
its a nice acid product for first timers.
we could've been great together
this cream would be great for combination skin.
gave me a good laugh
it's difficult the scoop out the perfect ratio of creme
also it look horrible under make up !!!!!!!
also odd- the josie moisturizer with spf works like a dream for me
great marketing on the part of josie maran.
it isn't even a great moisturizer
great for night time use
the citrus smell is fantastic.

pros-smells great, nice texture.
on paper this sounds like the perfect cleanser for me
great at removing all my makeup

what the big buzz is around this br
wears great under makeup

not great with makeup overtop
this product is really unique.

this moisturizer is fine but not great.
the smell is def not like the other "perfect world" products
it smells kinda nice
the original origins spf 25 was great !

replaced it with a very different mediocre product
i heard this mask was great from a beauty you guru
had high expectations for this product because philosophy is a great br
the reviews are great
it did smell amazing
this product is great at first.
the very big downfall of this product is the package
i love that this is loaded with good ingredients

i love kate's products, but this was mediocre.
i found nothing spectacular about it
kate somerville products are excellent
it does give a decent dewy finish to my skin
this face oil was horrible!!!!
the smell was horrendous
it felt great on my skin
this cleanser has a decent foam
it is a nice face wash
it smells amazing however it does an average job
who thought it was a good idea to put strong fragrance in a face wash?
nothing great about it.
such a terrible combination of design aspects.
this one does a nice job
my face was nice
the product works great
it smells nice though.
super strong at first
while my skin feels nice
my skin looked great
the nice lady at my sephora suggested this
it does have a great consistency
i expected a great product
it was quite overwhelming.
i found that to be amazing
the scent is also wonderful.
which was great for the morning
this product seems to do a lot of wonderful things for a lot of people
this product wasn't a good for for me,
feels good on the skin
felt like it was a "fun" mask without great results
this product is amazing.
excellent results for my overall complexion that i got with the original porless mask
the product itself is actually pretty great
to give it a good week or 2
the formulation itself is quite nice- a light
i do think that periccone md products are great.
the eyes look good
this works amazing on my crows feet
the pump is horrendous.
the smell is nice
it was awful on me
good - no miracles but good
the results are nice
"wow this stuff is amazing

it feels great going on
this line creates a real problem for me
a shame as the texture is really nice
the eye cream was nice
i expected impressive results
this is pretty strong
it seems like a good product overall

the good points: i like the smell
especially for that ridiculous price

caudalie's premier cru is a fantastic moisturizer
my pores looked enormous
love the idea of a powerful

it's not too impressive either

it has a nice applicator
feels good when applied
i just dont see an incredible difference
it's great on the go
maybe it's a great product
it feels nice in the morning

that it was an nice

this product was a huge disappointment.
the texture is nice and is absorbing fast.
nothing bad, just not great.
this one is very good
worked great at removing makeup
while it feels nice on the skin
it goes on easy
there is nothing remarkable about this lotion in general
feels good on the skin
this is an awful product.
continuing with the search for a great moisturizer
there was no "brilliant control" of oil or shine
strange, but sadly true
thankfully sephora has such a great return policy

such as sephora's own wonderful skin care products
this moisturizer made my skin look horrible.

this is ok but nothing remarkable.
i don't think it absorbs that great.
the packaging is horrible
it is a great deal for what your getting 2oz for 20 1star
great night moisturizer just not great for oily skin
the only good thing is that is easy to use that's it
it is really nice
feels nice to use throughout the day because it is cooling
it's a great price for the product
what's odd is that the sample size of this is the most amazing thing
it also feels nice and cool when putting it on.
it feels great going on.
it is a great foundation for the rest of my skin care
it did smell nice
i gave this cream a chance based on the incredible good reviews it has
the sorbet from this same line is phenomenal
when first putting it on it had a nice cream gel consistency
which would have been nice

it did smell great, but that is it
it would be nice to see brightening
the smell is awful
it feels nice on my eyes
the smell is that strong.

this product is excellent
day cream with spf is fantastic

can tell it's a good quality
good skin care basically comes from a good diet.
this may be a great cream
it keeps my skin feeling great.
genius cream is different.

feels wonderful on my skin
the scent is nice as well
only good thing is it smelt nice.
is overall a good product.
it could be a good product.
this product is probably great
my skin feels nice afterwards

2 stars only because the cream is decent.
it wasn't that great
hoping it will be terrible
application of the product is great
loved hope in a jar dry for about 15 years it was great
