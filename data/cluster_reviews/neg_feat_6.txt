i tried also another product of tatcha
now i'm almost done with the product
i figured if it costs so much it must be lovely
if i'm using a cream like this i expect to be able to feel it on my skin for quite awhile after applying
can't return due to having had to use a lot to figure out what the hype was
maybe it needs to be used few times before seeing results?
i ignored both of those since i used it at night.
i would never spend that much money on a product with so many issues
i give the two stars because i have very sensitive skin
this product was great in the fact that it did not irritate or cause a reaction at all
it would not absorb
thought this would help
the product is better to be used as a night cream in my opinion
as far as calming i didn't see any major result the price is way high for the quality of the product
with so many other options that also work
confused as to how they can justify that price
usually i expected great results because of the br
i an ready to change product lines into something more natural
just not good for what it should be.
i definitely regret not waiting until more reviews came in because i definitely had the same issue as a few others have mentioned
i will be returning this
i expected much more from an expensive product like this
with a 95$ price tag i'll have to keep trying different products
i wanted something that will be a new holy grail
for the price i really hoped it would have done something
i would have given this 5 stars
even if it's listed at all i tend to stay away
i just really wish they could have made it without any alcohol
but for now i will use the whole thing.
did not see a single benefit
however, it did not work any more.
hard to find the right amount
will be returning it as soon as possible
've tried other masks by glamglow
just try the other ones because those are really awesome
it may work better for different skin types
there are better masks that actually do what they claim to do
after hearing such amazing things i expected it to show some results
maybe it will work with someone who has more mature skin
you have to be careful though
because sometimes girls may think their face feels form
i've only used it 3 times in like 6 months cause i'm scared to waste it
i already take good care my skin
other masks might not be as fun
have wanted to try a glamglow mask for a while now
there are better out there
did not have instant results like the
the fewer the ingredients the better for me!
was excited to try one that might be able to actually firm up skin
there are plenty of serums that can do that without the wait time
maybe i have an unrealistic idea of what this mask should be doing especially for the cost
it actually made me feel ill for a while after using it
other than that it was fun to use
she suggested i try to return the product if i still have half left
doubt they would take it back
i feel there are way better products out there for the money
i would not buy this again despite how nice peel off masks feel they just aren't all they are cracked up to be
it isnt work 70 bucks i didnt see any change other than feeling softer the next day
i'll continue to use it since i own it
the hype i was expecting a lot more
it would be okay for day
even when i use the most minimum amount
it seems that fab might not be a good option for me since i have sensitive
perhaps because i put too much?
i wish it would have helped my skin
which is why i'm giving it the 2 stars
this product was just not the one for me
it didn't particularly affect any of its other claims
i will say though that i had no allergic reaction to it
would rather pay twice as much for a product that makes more of a difference to my skin
'm fairly certain this is the culprit
will probably return it
even though it is supposed to be for sensitive skin
it did not live up to the other products in the fab line
i tried using it multiple times without make up to be sure this product was in fact causing my skin to feel oily
it didn't break me out as other folks have experienced based on the reviews
i find that if i use too much or use it daily
if not for that, i'd be using it forever.
i realized this was the only new product i have added to my skin care routine
my skin was just not having it
i think the firming agents just work a little too good
so, i was eager to try this.
not for me at least.
if you want this for priming the under-eye for makeup then this is a great product for that
the biggest things that made me stop using it
mine actually got worse while using this.
wondering if the sample is more concentrated?
this product did not cause any skin reactions which is a big bonus
when you close it more comes out then you have too much again
i hardly use this since then
once i personally tried it though
and definitely not worth the 100 points i used!
this may be good for early to mid 20s.
than my eyes are looking very tired?why
even when i apply it twice a day this result is it
sure enough as others mentioned the twist feature forces product out both when you open
which i could look past
the sephora associate that was helping even couldn't make it work any better so we moved on to another br
only reason not 1 or 2 stars is that the price is friendly
not the best to be honest.
even thought i'm not getting it in my eye
i tried more, i tried less.
i think there are definitely better eye creams out there
there are other eye creams in the market can help reduce my dark circles for about the same price
so no point in wasting product
i do think it would be a good "beginner" eye cream on younger eyes who just need to get used to using it
both times i have had to return the product because the opening that dispenses the product has not been properly die cut out
i got the travel size with two other things.
i may buy it again or i'll get the all about eyes de-puffer which i used all through college
decided to try this since i love the regular so much
i think this one is better for people who have combination to oily skin
after reading the reviews i thought this product would be a total game changer
however i believe there are better options for a lower price out there
i just wanted something that would keep the area looking young now that i'm nearly 40
t is hard to talk about the effects/results so far
but at least it didn't make it worse.
they said that the sunscreen in this product can do that
they have had some returns before too!
for some reason murad and i never get along.
however by the time i get to work
guess this is more than i need
tried this when could not find my other murad product
i am more than half way done with my tube
maybe this product would work better without the pads
i've never used murad products before this
all this does is tighten
leave you with more fine lines
don't know how well it would work for more mature skin
i've never received the same results as i did in the store
my under eye wrinkles may need more than just an at-home treatment
so far i have not seen the results i was hoping for
i will keep using it
i am going to have to return this product
then be able to return them
i did not see any difference after using the product for a week
way too much work for very little outcome.
so this seemed to be much more irritating than products i've use in the past
for the $ there should be one product to h
i would have been super mad if i'd paid for such an ineffective product
i will continue to use until it runs out
i will keep looking,
you will be much happier with the application
don't plan on using any foundation over it
here’s how i’ve been using it
on the plus, it does work.
now i believe it.
thought this was going to work i put this on
i decided to try it again the next day thinking i may have used to much
it actually seemed to be even worse then the first time
t may work better for a younger face
as a primer, it can not hold my foundation well.
where they got these fabulous results
used this twice so far
i don't know… i think this is far too costly for its benefits
the lines still the same
will be returning it.
i appreciated the opportunity to able able to try this mask
you are better off to take the $ you are spending
at least that really will make your lines go away for a long period of time
not because i applied to much
i am going to keep using it in hopes there is a cumulative effect
especially with he dry winter we are having.
there are several things on the market in this price spectrum that will serve better
now i have to fix it
directions are not clear as to how long it takes product to be effective
sadly it did not live up to expectation at all
so far has not delivered for me
although it did eventually do so
which could be from something else
this is the only new product i'm trying right now
was hoping this would replace both
other products can do this for much cheaper
wanted to try a high-end
even though sephora's return policy is outst
only have very fine lines
t's not like this product had a lot of work to do
not really sure where all of the 5 stars come into play from the previous reviews
never have i felt so self conscious about this area
i think it will be the last
which never happens with other products that i've used
the sephora i was in did not carry that specific product so the lady recommended
my fine lines are still there
i am assuming me experience was so different than most posters because of my skin type
i would put this on
i hope that with time these issues continue to get better
i do see short term results each application
this really did not meet my expectations for the price point
perhaps i will try a different bobbi brown mask since this may work best for those with very dry skin all over
they are smaller than say
not to the point i feel it might be damaging to my skin
i really have seen absolutely no results from using this product
it might help me from picking
absolutely any mask could accomplish that
if your tight for money there are other masks that do the same for less
i usually think people are being dramatic when they say that in reviews
i just haven't found that to be the case
i still had such a hard time taking it off
thought i would give this one a try that someone had gifted me in the black
i will never use it again.
will never use again!
if i can rate it no stars i would.
however this was not my experience.
it was also really unpleasant to use.
maybe using it twice a day is too much.
i should have read the ingredients list here
this may not be for you
gel would not come out
as others have said
they are not as effective as these
the treatment just seems too temporary
hoping i'd be able to give or a glowing review
for the money should be a lot better
i really wanted to try this before taking the next step
i could see the product in the bottle
especially for not working
there are other face creams from sephora that i prefer
it happens even when no other products are used
it may work for you
feel like since i've been using it
yet when i use this it stings
after trying multiple others with no success
unfortunately as some others have mentioned it pills with makeup
i will be returning this next time i go to sephora because it's just an overall horrible product
not sure if it was a skin reaction or the product itself
i found waiting 10 minutes to allow it to sufficiently dry does help-
i would never put this on in the am
unlike renewed hope in a jar this product does not absorb very well at all
i think this will be a little too much for sensitive skins
as a two in one product it gets 3 stars
i've read that a couple of reviewers had the same issue
i try to avoid those in general
even though the claims are opposite
i'll stick with that one for the most part
i decided i wanted to try out their different lines
after results not good
you also have to use another product to remove eye make-up
too much comes out at any given time
tried a few of their items
/or never helped at all
probably still be straight
i can see how it would work for others
only reason it doesn't have 5 stars is i've only used it 2x so far
i really wish i could include a picture because my before looks 10x better than my after picture
i originally set out to by this because i liked that i could have a mask for pores that lasted more than just one use
i think it worked better when i left it on for 45
this will be safe for use
once those are gone
all with the same result.
decided to use it alone with no foundation
when i realized how expensive it is
if it had other skin care properties...maybe
i won't even be finishing the small sample packet because it just seems like an unnecessary step in the morning
i think this would be great for a much younger person
there is still easily a week product left
for the price of the product you better believe i expect to be able to use every drop
which i hoped was just because my skin was getting accustomed to the ingredients
it seemed to have a lot of potential
i will keep searching.
someone who hasn't already found the holy grail for their skin may like it
so much for trying something new.
will continue to search for the next best thing.
i will say this is more of an essence
this seemed to be a great one to try
it was difficult to apply
in all honesty this new revamped skin care line is not anywhere near as good as the previous one that had the "active soil complex"
because usually even when i put my mosterizer on
yet here they are :
however i found nothing special with this product
was really hoping this would help
horrible and will probably be returning.
i used this once
once i am satisfied with the oil amount
however-- nothing super special about this oil
if not better ones
use the rest of the sample later-----it will leak everywhere
i wasn't impressed with this oil as i couldn't justify paying so much for a product that isn't better than other oils out there
sometimes i need more than a click worth
this is such a rip off of milk's customer base that i'm likely never going to try any more of their products
they are very common
i saw so many reviews on this product
well either way i tried not to apply it to my face since it smelled
i rarely return things, but i returned this!
used a few times and could not say i loved it.
it felt good once i applied
however i'm unsure as to how i feel about this product
although i am not certain that these breakouts are a result of the balm however i will be taking a break from the product to see if it really is the reason for the breakouts
rarely have they met the hype
maybe it would be good to use at night
or just for the umdereyes
there are much cheaper products that do the same thing
i felt like i had to use a lot to get it all over my face
other than that i didn't really find a use for it
will only use it occasionally
was hoping this would be something that i would want to take on the long plane ride
that it is a stick
i may have been applying too much product
this may be better for people who are not prone to acne or have mature skin
honestly i had such high hopes
i will be returning this.
i tested it on 5 more friends to be sure
overall i would not recommend
i find i go through it very fast even after a small application
there are better items out there.
but unfortunately i'll be returning...
i think there are definitely better products.
this is quite expensive for the amount of product you get
i still found it to be a little heavy
would have to use a separate sunscreen with it anyway
i tried this product hoping it would help reduce the oil on my face
with hopes of the problem being fixed
after talking to the sales associate for a very long time
analizing my skin she decided that this product would be a good fit
now that i have used it for a while i do not see any improvement at all
also i have come to realize that it has no spf.
i will try something different from them next time
still trying to find an acne treatment that will work for me :/
doesn't improve my skin at all, like it claims.
made me breakout more than i already was
would hopefully control the oil a little bit better
there are much better lotions out there than this
starting to like this more
only use it on a small area of our face the last thing you want to happen is to spend lots of money on a product that makes your skin worse
i like the other one better
i even tried it with a number of different masks
masks will still work just as properly without this product
this product seems like one of those items created because a bunch of folks in a boardroom were trying to push out a new product
so even though the mixed reviews i thought it was worth a try
maybe it will be better with their masks because they know the ingredients
i could see a few potential benefits from this
she said that with some kinds of masks
i did not see any difference at all after using it with a few different masks
many samples are the exact same ones you can get with points
i felt that way immediately upon trying the sample
how it was supposed to help
there is no difference if i use a mask with or without it
for many reasons, that is.
i've even tried to do one side of the face at a time
i will say that applying a mask was much easier
my first thought was why do they need to add an extra step to their mask?
will not use again.
i got it as a part of the playbox
both worked exactly the same as they always do.
the maskimizer is said to make it easier to spread
i think it would be better as a primer for make up rather than for masks
then might as well use a toner at that point
multiple masks i tried actually went patchy when applying them which has never happened before i used this
will be returning this as soon as possible.
would give this zero stars if i could.
had hope that it would be something special
then have a bit too much product
i've now used this with quite a few masks.
as far as making any mask work better
i end up using less product because of it
it worked differently for each type
this product could work well for you
their skincare is just as good if not better
was hoping this product would help
for the price i expected this product to at the very least do what it claims
there are just way better cleansers than this
other than that i just felt that this could use a lot of work
this is not normal for me.
this facial cleaner is not as good as i was hoping
i never have that many
wouldn't work long term
t will probably work better for those without these concerns
with activesoil complex was so much better than what they are shelling out now
their old formula cleanser was the only thing that finally worked for my skin after trying so many different products
i saw that it was no longer available
i wish they would bring the old one back.
still very upset it was discontinued-please bring it back
i am now in search of the original as it seems they are no longer making it
i decided to try this product after seeing it in allure
it should be better than that
i won't be ordering another one of these.
it is just not the same
the biggest pro of this product for me is that the dry patches on my face seem to be gone by using this
i might come back to it in the future for a 2nd try
it did not absorb well at all
i will be returning.
i think this would be too light for even normal skins
as soon as i put this on
this will probably be fine
they seem to be leaving their roots.
i initially didn't think it was this because i had never had such a terrible reaction from a moisturizer before
my eyes themselves would be
i went through every single thing it could possibly be
really don't plan on trying any new clinique in the future
when my trial is out, i will not get it again.
i feel like it could be the combination of the two
obviously i wasn't expecting to see results having to wash it off
would work well for other skin types
it may work for you
i've used cheaper things that work better.
i wish i could use it because it probably has great potential to brighten skin
had to go exchange it for a more useful oil
didn't absorb very well
too expensive for not getting clear results.
i can only wear this once a week which seems like a waste of a product
for the price i wish it did more for my skin
i'd use the whole thing before reviewing just in case something magical happens after a certain amount of time
after using josie maran argan oil maybe i expect a different consistency--will keep using
apparently customers have told the person advising me that they've broken out once they stopped using this
however i had to return this
however, you have got to get past the smell.
it may end up working
not in the way i expected
always have had them even when i was younger
now that i am little older
for the price i should be getting something great
i will be returning it.
suggestions i could find
i felt that it did not absorb well.
), and not for the better.
however something in this cream did not work well with my skin
i will be returning tomorrow in hopes of finding something for sensitive/oily skin
however i'll have to return this
tried different foundations with it too
makes it last longer
i will continue using it for that purpose.
doesn't help at all with keeping my oil under control
never using this again.
like other reviewers have said
i understood that it was just that
i wont put the weight of that on this product though because it was just a factor
test this if possible
i wish they would repackage in a pump form
i tried it a few more times after that thinking it might have just been the mask i used before applying it
i've considered myself to have normal to combination skin
you are bound to have breakouts the next day
despite knowing all of this i was willing to try it
that may even be a little more expensive
that really work to improve the skin rather than just masking it
it may work for you
hoping it would work for me
it's difficult to say if i fully support this formula
i tried it/used it once
after one month of using as instructed i see little if any results
maybe it works for the other things mentioned
was hoping this will provide some level of comfort
gets way to much serum on it making it nearly impossible to put on
i wish it would have worked--i ended up finding an oil in another br
would have liked to see a air proof top
there is no little pamphlet inside the box that one can keep
i definitely plan to keep using it though
i am anxious to see if i get more impressive results over time
i used it for a week to see if it was just my skin being upset with a new cream
was excited to give this a try based on the many positive reviews
'm now only applying it to problem areas
i did feel it tighten my skin as soon as i started using
i did break out more while using this product
got these because i was using other br
that worked great however when i didn't have them i looked older
i even saw a plastic surgeon who said what they put in them cause an issues under my one eye if i didn't get shots to replace that ingredient for a year i would always have this issues now
plus i saw something online that said some companies where doing that
is a little more money for each set of patches however there where more of them
maybe if i used them first i may have had more luck
they can stay on for like an hour because there not paper at drys up like what i was using before
however i used them for about two weeks to see if i saw anything change because sometimes it takes awhile
since we have very different skin
they didn't do anything for two different people with different skin types
these things cost way to much for them to work for 5 min after you take the patch off
i wish they were wider
i used them as directed at least 10 times
not happy with these at all!
they did not affect the fine lines around the eyes
perhaps they work for some people
i will stick with others
these feel great on however
i feel like they could be smaller
would add up to be 180 dollars for the amount you're getting here
it turns out, these are just not for me.
i've used about 5 so far
nothing really special about these
it doesn't provide the kind of results i'd hoped for
this doesn't seem to be making any lasting difference after a month of use
here are the pros
there are some cons that i found
which i can live by
this is one of those products that are simply ok.
i think that it has helped with the area around my eye not looking so tired
i will say though that i have sensitive skin with roseacea
i think i'll be returning.
i think this will be the first product that i will return to sephora because it actually makes me look much worse instead of better
there are a lot better masks out there for similar cost that i've seen more results for my skin
so upset...spent so much on this product.
i did not notice any specific benefits to using this mask other than the fact it made my skin feel very soft after using
i so wanted to like this as others have
unwilling to accept i was going to have to go back to square one for a new tried
i've never understood the frustration of people who got upset about the removal of certain products from the market
they haven't improved enough to justify the cost of the product
it seems to help slightly as long as you keep using consistently
not even close to as bad as it was with this oil
maybe i had too high expectations for this product
as in didn't absorb well
it might work for some people
otherwise it would be a 5
will not use again
like the other reviews said
really no different than something you'd find over the counter
sephora should be embarrassed that this is the third time i'm writing this review because they keep deleting negative reviews
this was the single worst thing i have ever used from sephora
i see there are lots of great reviews so maybe this product works for other people
i should have known this wasn't a good product when i tried it the first time
not as impressed as i hoped i would be.
'll keep this one short
when i use this
this was the only product i used that was new.
i'll go back to my $20 vitamin e night mask that feels even better for way cheaper
there are plenty of other masks out there that do so much more than this one
which to be fair are results that i don't see with 98% of products that claim such results
it will definitely fall short
for more mature skin because it's just too weak to be used alone
with that being said
i expected way more but it's just another mask.
like the other ones i've tried
i found that it was too deep to be a highlight on my fair skin
i like to use this product as a base before i go in with my foundation because i find that it is too thick when mixed in
harder to blend then i would like
it is more difficult to use
there are definitely other products in this line that i like more
do wish there was an option just a step lighter
i couldn't figure out the best way to apply the product in the cap
they are not very clear
like i said previously
maybe there are 6 samples' worth of product in there
i returned it because even at the sale price i didn't want to use as much as i needed to get a good glow
i already have a product that does that
i will stick with one i already use
knowing that it would have it's limitations
there are other cleansers out there that do the same job
so people who like that it doesn't have fragrance might like some other products as well
they test on animals so no
the reason i ultimately returned it
as was the case with me
thought it would be nice to have this as well
i would however recommend to only use this at night
i probably wouldn't purchase the full size since there are so many other great moisturizers that can be used both morning
i'd consider trying it out again
people with very dry skin or those who live in a harsher climate would probably benefit better from this
plus the fact that it has such a fragrance leads me to believe that it's probably not good for people who may have reactive skin
that being said i had 2 problems with this.
it stayed red for longer than usual even for a products that don't work for me
this may work for people without sensitive skin.
i decided to give it a 3/5 overall because it may be good for some one
it does take a long time to absorb
the experience has beeen so unpleasant that i admit i just can't bring myself to put it on more than every other day
it did not do much especially with the harsh weather we have been experiencing
perhaps not the best for people with sensitive skin
this one by far
this cream did not do justice or came remotely close to healing those areas
s that simply perform better
i for some reason was expecting it to be a lot bigger
this one wasn't meant to be for me
i know it is not being absorbed
not only did it not improve my fine lines
it made them worse
it doesn't feel like it would give any long term skincare results or benefits though
i also feel like i ran out of this way too quickly considering the price
all that being said
it seems that this product would work better for that skin type
will try the whipped cream next to see if that works better
was hopeful that this would help
for $65 i was expecting more.
reading all the wonderful reviews here on sephora as well as other sites
perhaps i had too high of a hope for this product?
overall i am finding i have to use quite a lot to achieve the hydration effect
means i have to apply
i tried it several ways on my combo skin.
this was going to be my first try for that br
there are much better moisturizers out there save your money
i like those much more
those will never leave my skin care line
i only used it up because i paid so much $$$ for it
how it performs on a skin could have been better
since this says it gives an "intense hydration" i figured i could still use it
it still is not doing what i expected
all in all set was a good idea as i am new to the line
it comes with 5 different products to try out
normally this would be a good thing
saying that this product will give my skin the total hydra needs especially in winter
however i was pretty disappointed after using it
i apply twice because once is not enough
some work better then others.
the larger jar when other than the great fragrance there's nothing making it better than less expensive products
the new is not for me
this is the second moisturizer from philosophy that i have to stop using because they changed the formula
i will not be using this again
not sure if it was from the fragrance or just the over all formula
that is a shame since i had high hopes!
i will be returning this.
i would give a zero star review if i could.
the only reason i am giving this two stars is because it is not greasy feeling
so at least it has that going for it.
if i had never tried the old formula
that is not that case
i now have to search far
i figured with all of the hype surrounding this product it would be even better than the old formula
if that was even possible
noticed it was not doing the job that it used too
tried this although it was very light
i cannot speak to how well this works over the long-haul because i had to wash it off after about 10 minutes when the smell did not go away
did not work as was stated
i assumed it was just my skin doing a usual purge with a new product
maybe it works for some people
not badly, but still.
i've tried it a few different ways
it actually made me want to use face masks more often
still confused how this works
other times it goes on
i own so many different products by them.
but what the h is this?
be prepared to be disappointed
the directions are not very clear
i've yet to have any of the white issues that others speak of
i really hoped this would be a good one.
best way i could describe it
i will be returning this.
the more i applied, the worse it got.
they regularly over-fragrance their products which make them more likely to irritate rather than improve your skin
the way my skin feels after applying it i will not be purchasing this
unfortunately i was unable to use this for more that 2 weeks
i can't say i tried this product more than once because it was so strongly scented that i almost wanted to wash it off
have been diligently applying it ever since
or too many "fine lines
this was not that product.
in order to use had to add to another serum just to get it to spread
i couldn't deal with it for more than a week.
mother would find this to be too much
it would feel the same
i'd probably give it one or two stars without the smell
do not count the first week i used it
then the product alone isn't living up to the expectation
i tried to use it a bit differently today
i think its too expensive for what it is
maybe a "miracle" product for those under 40.
to use it because of that
it's a struggle every single time i have to use it
as far as i am concerned it is just a regular cleanser
was hoping this would help with that
did little in terms of being anything other than a decent
i felt like i needed to use tons of product
the rest of the formula may not be
it barely does anything as far as volume
it would be better than not having any on.
quickliner they both were a disappointment too
both were too dry
as others have mentioned
not quite sure what is separating out.
it actually looks worse after i apply this
i wanted to give it time in case i needed to "get used to" it
i've never experienced anything like that before
hoped this would be perfect
i will not be using this ever again.
unlike the power couple
i figured it is best to use 1 a day or every other day
really loved the results from that one-time use
mature as some might be
both have been game changers for my skin
i feel like i've tried slightly better ones for much less
using it is just a waste of my time.
it hasn't offered anything useful to my skin
i only used it once
wanted to keep using it, but had to stop.
this product might work for you
may re-evaluate this one in the summer when my skin is not so dry
however besides being just a good lightweight oil free
just as others said
i could feel these bumps
nothing more or less
not not unlike some other br
maybe the normal/combo skin type one will work better than this one
overall i have no desire to use it ever
thought that could be it
i find myself having to reapply multiple times a day
t would last longer
maybe once i find a night cream that is more repairing this will work better
really just wish they would have never discontinued the correcting cream :
time to try to make this work
there are several pros
this is just too average
won't repurchase this ever again nor recommending to people who have the same skin type as me
thought that was it
finally read reviews like i had been meaning too
didn't last long especially since i had to use quite a bit each time
without that my skin would be worse
not enough product to justify the price nor are the results after using consistently
except perhaps those with the most sensitive skin on the planet
you may as well treat your face with overpriced
this is not even close to being effective.
which i used forever with great results
i will likely switch to a different glycolic after years of using this one
the new one has more product that's why it is more expensive
the new one you have to pump about 25 times to get what you need for your face
i honestly think that a regular non water based moiturizer would be better for oily skin because they usually absorb better
this may work for you
am going to have to use it by itself again to see if it feels hydrating
i think it will be perfect for the hotter months.
for that reason i can't imagine buying the full size being worth it for anyone with very dry skin because you have to use so much at every use
i couldn't give it one star because i've been using it on top of an oil
i wish i could see from outside how much product was left in the bottle
tried all week with no good results.
maybe this will be better in the summertime
though i try to use up the items that come in the monthly box
i will not be using this product again.
all the days i tried my face had become extremely oily
i explained it to myself every other way: period cycle
need to get used to the product
the first time i thought it was hormones or something
they suggested this product
i tried about 20 ways to incorporate it in my routine
so sad that this product will only serve for my h
have worked for me
i should have left this one alone
every time i use it
was told that it would really help with the dark circles i suffer from
no better than a $10 bottle
i got this product for free to try.
since she seemed to think the product i was using
so returning it is going to be a challenge
i assumed the smell would at least dessipate
this does not feel in any way special compared to other gels
was only able to use it one time
didn't last as long as i would have liked
it is somewhat cooling when first put on which may be nice
i do like algenist's line in general though
there are definitely better sleep masks out there
this may work for others
what i was using before was better than this.
in result i exchanged the product for something else
which would be fine in winter
will probably take it back :
i tried few other products from here
the only plus is that once you figure out how to dispense just a small amount of the product
am unsure why this product is so expensive
i feel like this product was created to make women worry about
not as firm as they used to be
will continue to use the entire bottle to see if this works
which i need both
i think this will be great for some
which for me personally is super important as i have dry skin
so will continue using until i run out
now as far as the depuff, yes.
it have done nothing so far
will be returning it.
this more or less left nothing on my skin
haven't tried the new one yet
make me look more alive
i tested it at once per day to make sure that my skin wouldn't react
after establishing that it didn't really have an effect
used it all hoping it was just my skin reacting to something new
didn't clear up until i used a different product
literally didn't see one difference in my skin i could have giving it some more time
for $55 dollars i need to see some instant improvements
i've tried other products before
but i will have to return it.
i really had high hopes for this.
thought i'd give this a try since i was in the market for a new moisturizer
all my other masks at least do something
perhaps with time people could see results
decided to try it although it had only one very good review
will continue searching for that one great one.
i always had good results with clarins
even essential oils to their products when they know they are not good for your skin?
i've never had any before
that there would be no other product out there that would work in 2 weeks
there are at least 4 different oils so maybe a bit much for daily use
sure, it was cooling but that was about it.
this one is a no go
hope this review helps others.
it has gotten me interested in this line
i plan to try other products in this line to try out
it also is just fun to apply onto the face.
some of the things i try to avoid in skin care
you definitely need to apply this on quickly
by itself it doesn't help much
they hold up well
which i think would turn some people off.
it is not the best i have tried many better creams in my recent days
perhaps i was expecting too much.
many others out there that firm up the skin better
not so much that i would be willing to have to smell it for hours
there are plenty of other products that are as good or better
but i still would recommend it!
you just have to let it set for at least several minutes before putting on anything else
it did make my foundation last longer
it did not help make my makeup last longer
decided to give this one a try based on the reviews
several days may not have been enough time to produce changes
was being really overly optimistice to think this product could make my skin look like hers
still have the same issue
i tried applying it different ways
i tried to make this work.
i can safely say after many trials with this product
not too sure about making it smooth.
as i always do with new products
unfortunately i had to return this.
i will say this though
this is by far the worst
so of course i had to try it
this doesn't even give average results
have no idea how anyone can put on make up after this product
i'll probably continue doing this just to not waste the product by throwing away
not as amazing as they advertised it to be
as many have noted
bags under my eyes enough that someone commented about them
this one was a fail for me.
that i wondered if i could have the same result
have no reason to ever be interested in this again
not sure if this one will stay in the rotation
it turned out to be a total fail
as others have noted
on the off chance it would work for me
this did not last for long
i expect at least a good run at oil control
it may have even made things worse honestly.
i've found that it doesn't really make much difference by the end of the day
i felt like i ran out very quickly even though i barely used a dime sized amount each time i used it
tried using these multiple ways
from coverfx i expected better
was really hoping this would keep my tzone more matte
each time i used only one drop too
should have read reviews first.
i've learned if any product gets less than 4 starts it's often not worth the time or money
was hoping this would mattify
i did not return this item upon its first use.
i used it every way i could think-- under foundation
on top of foundation-- the result was unfortunately the same
i've tried it all three ways
it has the same feel
i tried this in all 3 ways suggest
then i was more oily then i would have been if i didn't use this
total fail every time.
i tried using is several ways.
if i had to choose i'd say it worked best as a primer
that still have never worked for me
thinking they would work well with each other
this would be fine if you had a short day planned
i tried this product several ways because i wanted to confirm it was not user error
so this might be going back to the store.
i tried using it alone
i tried it multiple ways
he results just weren't good
i did all three together
i guess it is meant for people who are minimally shiny
try to make it work
after trying a ton of different things
it was not to be
i usually feel limited to which foundations i buy since many are not great for oily skin
when i first heard about this it sparked my interest because i was hoping it would allow me to try some new foundations that i wouldn't usually use
although i did find this product to help reduce oilyness
this makes it difficult to get the amount you need
you usually end up with way to much
getting a sample before investing $52 for a product that may not be the holy grail you were hoping for
using it different ways
i really had high hopes for this.
each time my skin looked more oily than i normally would not using this product
this might be a good product for some
haven't been using it long enough
i know there are more expensive ones with his other lines
have to give it more time though to see
that my fine lines seemed to be getting worse
would never use again
my lines are longer
prevent the few existing lines from getting worse
was hoping that it will lift
think the ingredients were just too harsh for me
i won't continue using this but he will
would love to find a product that actually helps with dark circles
they were very big where everyone looked at my face at work
i would expect this cream to be perfect since it is very expensive
there are so many amazing moisturizers coming out at sephora right now
i think i'll have to switch to something lighter with better oil control for now
may have been better off with just a face oil
the packaging could be better
but, every time i use this product, i break out.
i've never had to have so many extractions done.
it would probably work better for someone with dry
this was one of them
you will go through this product very quickly
it felt so great all night that i decided to purchase it on my own later
then i had no choice
i think it's just because there are so many ingredients in this thing that it overwhelmed my skin
as soon as i stopped using it though
no real pay off
i did have higher expectations for this product
i will say though
give this product a try
i feel like this would be an amazing product if my skin produced a little more oil on it's own
for the price i was expecting a little more especially considering all the hype surrounding drunk elephant
i tried this both with
i think they put that word in products to attract the more mature ladies
you really are not getting a lot of product
so i had high hopes for this product.
i noticed that it would settle in my pores if i used too much in that area
i could not put foundation on on top of this.
i really like other products from this line
i tried it without makeup to see if it did any better on its own for a natural
other than that---it's not that special
maybe that was the problem
i've tried to make this work many ways
have it absorb quickly for makeup application than this will do the job
maybe winter is not the right time for it?
not as bad as other moisturizers have been though
i would need this product to go further if i were going to incorporate it into the daily routine
i prefer that they stay hidden or at least minimized under makeup
it might be a great product
i able to look past that
i tried it a few times to see if i could get over the smell
all things considered this one is palatable enough
this is not the right product to use
i won't even be using the rest of the sample.
the pump i find is difficult to work.
for $140 i truly wish the company would improve the packaging as this would be the reason why i will not buy it again
the fact that this says it works immediately
will most likely switch back to a cream that's half the price that does the same thing
those pesky bags that have started if would work well
i can't even get past the awful smell of this oil to continue using it to see the benefits
as a result it has invited even more dirt
have no need for a face scrib
they need time to work
i also found that for the price there are better cleansers out there
definitely agree with the other reviewer about it being cheaply made
for one, i could not tolerate the scent.
i would have to go over it 2x just to feel as though my face was clean
because maybe that works with this
i usually go for something more lightweight
but i still use it.
the most disappointing part is that my skin has never been so dry
my skin needed more than just this.
probably will not ever buy after my sample is gone
yet my face would get super oily at the same time
this seemed to make my skin produce more oil than it normally does
that i could find
which really ticked me off seeing as how i got this exact same thing as a sample like last year
i would not recommend this product at all.
even when used very sparingly
which i get very very infrequently
wholeheartedly recommend everything i listed above without any hesitation at all
those are all products i always come back to
already have tons of other products that do the same job
come on sephora how about some quality control
only used it once
one time was enough for me to strongly dislike this product
i would still use a primer with it
however i gave the product 3 stars because the product claims to do so much
i still had to use a primer on top of it
i will stick with the similar product that i already use
like others, i received this as a play!
i didn't get to use this product very long because the tube would not dispense any of the product after only three applications
this has done absolutely nothing for either of those problems
as far as i could tell
this would be a great beauty find if the application wasn't so difficult
if you are at all sensitive to fragrances stay away from this product
rather made it much worse :
like other have said
i wish it were a little less intense.
wanted to try more of it
i tried this only once
it's the only new product i've been using in my face routine
i only used this product once
never will i ever use this product again!
this has continued to be a struggle
not all the time
instead of helping with it
it seemed to look better longer throughout the day
after about a week of use i think it might be causing breakouts :
i will give this product a break
not that different from any st
not a deal breaker like others have said
this was fine as far as i could tell
i suppose it would be nice to have as a travel item since it does so many things in one
this probably wouldn't work for others with really sensitive skin
not really on board with it
would probably work for those with very dry skin
while i did not notice any of the claims this product makes i will continue to use the sample to see if that changes
i never had a bad experience with them
i could tell i was starting to break out as well.
this product hasn't helped at all
i can see how it works so well for other people
hope that one works better
i used up all of the other products so quickly
this product gets tacky as well also adding to the reason why it should be used as a primer
unfortunately i will be exchanging this product
it also has made me break out pretty significantly on the two different times i tried it
this product unfortunately was not for me :
i've given it two stars because i do think it is somewhat moisturising
sadly had to return this one
like most of the comments have said
this product did not absorb at all
i decided that it would be the perfect time to try it
the second time i think i used too much
this one is probably my least favorite
i think there are better products out there.
it seems to be hit or miss for most people
did no one test this before they put it on the shelf?
as with others who have commented
this one was just not for me
then follow with a light simple lotion than pay so much for something that gives similar results
its a no for me
i could get past that
you can find cheaper alternatives that do a better job
didn't absorb as quickly as i'd hoped
being that i am more a combination skin type i was hoping to really love this consistency for summer
maybe for a different skin type :)
once i started using this i got so much
i hoped this would be my salvation
how can i be having such a different experience than everyone else?
might just order it
i wish it was sturdier
it seemed to continue getting worse
i wish i could say i had the same experience as the majority of these reviews
which hopefully i will be able to heal
one of my problems is that it didn't last long at all
i used the entire bottle just to be sure
tons of other products that do the same thing
i imagine would be great for post-gym as well
this is going to have to be my least favorite
i agree with other reviewer's
i did not find it to be working well
i find it much easier to remove
i felt as if my pores were actually bigger.
you'd think with the apparent alcohol content this would be faster
i would say avoid it
if you are having trouble with little bits of it
you have to use a lot of product
i expected so much from this product
i tried it twice and will be returning it
then it would probably have been a much better experience
can get too time consuming
it was very difficult to make an even application
other than that this product does nothing at all.
have never had this issue
i also found it difficult to remove
as some others have said
this will be going back.
as we were using it
all other origins masks i used have always left my skin feeling better afterwards
this one just has too much alcohol in it
the product doesn't absorb into my skin as much as i had expected it to
could possibly be the scent which isn't strong for most people
i really think that some drugstore products work better
not a horrible product by any means
i feel like a lot is needed to get the benefits of the sun protection
so no make up on.
you have to clean more than once to get that clean effect
i though this would work because it's made for sensitive skin
a little pump is more than enough
tried this because if the sensitive skin claim
i got this because the introduction said it is good for all skin types
with that being said
because i can simply follow up with some of josie maran's argan oil afterwards
i would keep adding it to my loves whenever i placed an order
i expected to at least see or feel a difference in my skin after using this mask
it tries to be too many things
without you being able to feel it
i may try again in the summer.
i will continue to use until it's gone
time to try another one...
was excited to try this new product until i saw all the chemicals that i could not pronounce
i did enjoy the product that i was only able to try a couple of times
it was not heavy at all
as for weather or not the product worked remains to be seen as i didn't have enough to use for the duration it should have been used to have any results
the product definitely does tighten almost immediately
will use until gone
because it was so expensive
it works no better than other less expensive cleansers i have tried in the past
if they changed that it would be a much better product
however there are a couple of things that i didn't quite like
this product is definitely different than most other products i've tried in the past
everyone should start early
these are all true.
i figured that this product would help with that
at first it seemed like it did help
will return and try something different.
it wasn't as heavy as most i have used
i used this for some time
not something you would expect from something touted as being suitable for sensitive skin
had to pump twice more to be able to get a correct amount in my palm
i convinced myself to use this product for the next five days after to just see if maybe it would pay off in the long run considering how much i paid for this product
because of the product delivery fail i think i've used too much to be able to return it
this may clean well
will not be using this again
i've definitely used others that work quicker
the reason i give it three stars is because it does not provide that much moisture
find that they are more likely to irritate sensitive skin
this was not it.
see if it has any long term effects on the skin
box and will not be adding this to my routine.
i've found i'm not as sensitive as i once was
so perhaps that was some of my skin's issue?
beyond disappointed in them.
so this would be an extremely expensive
it looks like other people had this problem too
i would avoid this
i believe this made my face breakout also.
i didnt think it was this product at first
i could smell the alcohol as soon as i put some in my h
i expected more from lancôme.
was really excited to use this as i have previously enjoyed using other lancome moisturizers
there are two reasons why i would not buy it
almost no one should.
i received this in my play box like many others.
and this is possibly the cause of con number two.
this product was the only chance to my routine
it would be good if you were looking to use this only as a sunscreen as it is lightweight
not sure if this is a new formula or if i'm getting products mixed up
if i could rate it that high
i did not expect the formula to be different as well
once again i am disappointed with trying different products that are mattifying
that product worked for me far better than this one did
it may just be me
also have to use a lot to feel like i'm actually covering my whole face
i used the whole tube because it was all i had
unfortunately this was not it.
was hoping this would be a moisturizer i could wear all year long
this was not one of them.
honestly i won't hold that against it because is there really a product that can do both well at the same time??
i used this both alone
i tried applying very little
too bad because i really had high hopes for this product
i will clearly have to use this stuff only on oily t-zone
return this product because it was so disappointing
i think this would be great for people who don't have problematic skin
certainly not better than any st
it may work for others
this unfortunately made me break out all over after 2 uses especially in locations i don't usually have problems like my nose
made me breakout more than i already was.
is fairly priced i appeared pimples in areas where i am usually clear on my face didn't help just feel like everything just got worse i would not repurchase this
it does not absorb well at all
even worse to be honest
but it was a true failure .
i read several reviews about other people who had the same problem warning that this "purging phase" is not a phase
'm giving this another chance in conjunction with their toner
i might as well finish the bottle since i paid for it
i used it alone or with foundation
i wanted to like this so badly that i stuck with it in the case that i would be proven wrong
because i think my skin did benefit from using this in some ways
however my main purpose for purchasing this was to clear up some breakouts i'd been struggling with recently
i will continue to use what i have left
was hoping that this oil was as proactive
after having two different people recommend it i decided to try it
definitely worth the try though
especially seeing how many people it works for
will be going back to trying the luna oil
two stars because while it did nothing for me it seems to work for others
one time use and never again.
i expect to see some results too
be careful with how long you leave it on
all of that being said
i won't be purchasing a full sized though because i didn't really see any changes in my skin after using it
making it hard to apply to my face
i did however think my face was exceptionally clean
there are way better masks for this price point.
that's about all the benefit i got from this one
seem to be taking up room where actual useful product could be
this might be good for those with sensitive skin.
i did like how it felt that it was tightening.
the product would not come off!!
probably could make your own at home for a lot less money
i would have given it one
it is pretty expensive so though it suggests applying every day
i feel a lot is wasted during application
the face masks from sephora work better honestly.
this may not be the best product for you
i think their products would maybe work better for people with very sensitive skin?
i wanted to live it and had high hopes.
it didnt really make any difference or feel different after using it
3 stars b/c i think it would be a fair consideration for anyone with sensitive skin
other than that, it did nothing.
i will pass on this for sure.
i am thinking i could get the same results with some organic marmalade at a fraction of the cost
sometimes can be hit
it was not easy to apply as there are little chunks that are hard to spread
she said there was no benefit to using a tool like that
i can't get an even amount of product to dispense from both sides no matter how i press down on it
which i could do with the original version
tried to give this new one a chance
found that i didn't like it on its own
as it doesnt do much for the skin
or at least something worthwhile
i could definitely see her products being a problem for those with sensitivity issues
however this one is not a favorite.
most people are correct it does indeed leave a film
unless you are possessed of the fairest of skins
i am perplexed at why that one is called luminizing when the effects are quite mattifying
if you can move beyond the ingredient list
works well just not better than what i have.
illuminating primers out there that would do the exact same thing as this cream only at a much lower price
the staff member who assisted said certainly that this was the exact same as the black mask
but they need to give a bigger bottle.
i would give it 5 stars if they just gave you enough product to do it more than a few times even if they had to raise the price already it's super expensive for a peel off
so for those who want a more sensitive version of the black mask i would get this one
have two very different results
they are two different products made for very different reasons
personally i will stick with the black mask because i have younger skin
there are lots of better ones available
this one will sadly be going back
it's the first boscia product i have said that to
hoping that this was would be just as good
i found it very hard to apply
you need to use a decent amount of the product
i didn't use it continually once a week
i'll sadly have to return this one.
also, the product does not absorb well at all.
and it doesn't seem to be absorbed at all.
trying to find a way it wouldn't be a total loss of money
the money you spend on these little liars in jars is not worth it
im sure in time it may help with crows feet
i couldnt make it more than 2 weeks as it dried me out even more than i was
not as much as i expected
have been dealing with a pretty bad breakout that's been affecting parts of my face that usually don't give me any problems
i did some looking online
this had such great reviews from people with similar skin issues
that i have not gotten in a while
it did not help with the problems
this product might be good for someone with normal skin
did not find that this absorbed quickly
that may be because i was having to use so much of it
i liked it for the first few days because of how light it felt on my skin
what a shame, i had high hopes for this one.
i will no be trying this again.
this may be better for a different skin type
t's hard to imagine that was possible
for the money, i was expecting more.
but they work the same for me.
except for the heating that this one has that the other does not
i’ve been wanting to try several other farmacy products
this more than likely won’t be touching my face again
still plan on trying several other products from farmacy
may be worth a try as many people seem to love it
the feel of using it
i will be returning this product unfortunately
unfortunately as soon as i put it on
i found so many products that are way less expensive
i kept it on the full amount of time because it said it would be "warm
i dealt with it to see what the end result would be like
if they made this in smaller amounts for cheaper that you could use quickly then i might consider purchasing
in my opinion is equal to or better than this mask
even the caudalie detox or gylcolic masks are so so much better than this
for $56 i would also like it to deliver on the hydration front as it's winter time right now
giving it another shot only because the reviews are all pretty good
hopefully i get better results
glad these were inexpensive.
used it many times, just did nothing.
each product works differently for everyone
i read in the reviews that the tube had a lot of air in it
the box was so much bigger than the actual tube with excess that was unnecessary
i'd rather spend money on something that mildly works
've been using it after another cleanser to get that smooth feel
it was completely different
definitely have used better
have used it 3 times so far
cannot get over how strong it is
will be unable to use it :
i gave this product two stars as it didn't harm my skin
i then got three pimples not sure if it was for that
all in all its nice to have if your budget allows extra stuff
will continue to see if any improvement
it also didn't improve skin in any other way.
this had so many good reviews
i disappointed with how much this product costs considering the outcome
it might work well for some
i've tried a lot of masks that are anti-aging worth less than this
there are so many good products out there so don't waste your money on this one
even tried it too
they are supposed to be there
it could have been cleaning stuff out
i will be returning it though.
even longer to get all of it off
made it difficult to move the magnet from the tissue once it had collected enough product
so many better choices out there for a fraction of the cost
there is nothing special about the results you get from this mask
the scent is the kind of like essential oil which i believe some people would love
then you are done
there's so many masks that do the same thing in much lesser time
there are way better masks out there
i couldn't tell if it worked by just testing it a couple times
it was a waste of money since i cannot return it after using the whole bottle
there are plenty of other masks that are more cost effective
cheaper and easier) that give the same results.
i can get the same results with other masks with a lot less hassle
there are plenty of easy to use "miracles" out there
i think this would be better for normal/dry skin types
they are so sheer
the products tend to sit on my face rather than sinking in
i am not scrambling to pay other bills
there is no way in the world you could get this to go on smoothly
could only get some of face done
i used exactly as they said
though- so 2 stars there
took too much product to actually clean my face though
might be going back to my old stand-by
for a while i thought that would be impossible because the ingredients are so amazing
have never had any type of skin issues from any other product like this product gives me
i would stay away from this if you have sensitive skin
now i have to get my skin to clear up!
which also didn't work out for my skin
i might be going back to my old stand-by.
get a sample or think twice before buying if you have combination skin
the smell might be hard to get past
i tried many times
unfortunately it did not meet my expectations
not sure if i should keep trying it a few more times or return it
all i said was the pump should be changed to a dropper because the pump makes me lose a lot of product
i tried it in different ways as well
forehead which means i sort of have to use it as foundation
t can be worn alone or under foundation
however that is not the case
i could barely remove it which means it's long lasting
probably because of how heavy the formula is
couple this with the fact that it's the same price as my usual foundation with less than half the amount of product
i think i need to return it since there is no point keeping it
next i tried to use my make up to see how it looked
t would be fine
i might be able to cover it with a very full coverage foundation
as all the reviews said you only need to use a tiny amount
after using it for a month under my foundation i have come to the conclusion it does not work
am having a very hard time using this product
not all like the video made it look
although this product did not deliver on what it said in my opinion
it appears that it would be light
they really need to make this in at least 'light
i find it to be flaky at times though.
said that i would use it
like many others they are gushing about is not "life changing"
i expected this to be a lot better than what it was
it will have to go back.
there are more affordable options that do just as good if not better
for me i was hoping it would be that
keep the recipt in case you need to return this
really disappointed and expected more.
there are way better primers out there that are cheaper
not even filled the whole way
will not use again.
i used it once
could only imagine how much worse it would be for anyone darker than me
that was the extent of what i liked about it
i would have given it 5 stars
thought for sure this would be a winner
unfortunately i will return
those two products did not settle well for me
it actually made them look worse
i wanted to like this because i've tried other it products before seeing it at sephora
there is nothing on the package that says it has to be shaken up before using
hoping it would work
however this primer does not allow product to be put over it
i would have to remove the product
ultimately, i had to return.
made my face so much more oily then it already is :
it was almost like this primer never set properly
it didn't help my make up stay on at all
this product seemed to help my makeup stay on longer
perhaps i need a little more play time with this product
the name is a little disappointing to me because it didn't deliver claims as i would have hoped
feels good when applied but no results.
was hoping this was going to work
thought it would be a good night eye cream
should have stuck with that
might as well have used water.
to look at the pictures next to each other
i used the entire container to be sure that it wasn't something that needed time for any lasting results
most higher end eye products don't do this to me
not only there were any
i continued using it hoping that my skin just needed to get used to it
i've used many many different under eye series
i can name a few that have worked
regret the day i decided to stop using it to try the two week challenge because it did not work for me at all
i really wanted to like this product since i have purchased other items from it cosmetics that really works for my skin
you seem to need a good deal of product to cover the whole eye area
unfortunately there are also some ingredients that can cause issues for those of us with very dry or sensitive skin
but wrinkles should not be there yet.
this made them show up more
maybe i was expecting so much more for this cream special because is not a cheap cream
not sure who this would work for
its one of the worse eye products i have ever used
i will write again when i have used it longer.
i can't tell that this helped any more than much cheaper eye creams
still unsure of its results
will post again when i see more
tight which has never before been a problem for me
after the first week of trying to use this a day moisturizer it did not work well with any of my foundations
there was more product
i plan on using the entire thing
strong enough that i've finally given up
i tried using less
have heard many great reviews
i found this to be too heavy
if i could get a liquid version of it the way i can with the ceramidin
this is not the one
i need to get around to returning it.
my hope was that it would make my skin tone look even enough on days i wanted to go without foundation
i may try the treatment
see if that is a better match for me
sadly i have to bring it back.
will not be using again!
that is about it
it still did not absorb
i did try many times.
it still has not worked for me
hoping that i would be the kind or results other people have been seeing
it does it slightly less well than i would have wanted it to
i could have just been going about it the wrong way
was eager to try it since i was about to leave the country
not that i was expecting it to
that could've been because i was on an airplane while using it
i personally think it's best used for people with intense redness who want to use it under a foundation
i get to try it out for a decent amount of time before i review
it could possibly be the tint in it
therefore it may not be the best for deeper skin tones
it's not as much as i was hoping for
it didn't blow my mind or drastically improve my skin's appearance—you could probably find a similar product on the market at a much cheaper price
i could never use this alone.
i am still trying to work with it to determine the right amount to blend in
i would not recommend for people with dark skin
although i have essentially been able to control my acne
thought that this was just what i needed to feel comfortable in my skin
unfortunately, this was not the case.
if any change at all
for people who simply have a rosy complexion that they would like to cancel out
i feel as though this product might work out
which is not the kind of product i was in search of
i also used this along with one other new product for a week or so
i never get acne as bad as i have it now
this was the only thing i had added to my routine
sadly i will be returning it.
i read reviews that people have used it by itself
i really had high hopes after reading the reviews
we had to return it.
maybe is to use under foundation or with people with more light skin :
i must have applied too much
i will be returning.
even with makeup you can still slightly see it.
i often use this in place of a real foundation.
could be a good product for someone with less reactive skin
i expected the same from this one
with that being said i don't use very much.
it doesn't seem to aggregate either conditions on my face
i am going to continue to use for a while longer
have found they work best for my combination skin type
the only thing that i am using consistently is this
definitely not using it again
but not sure re-purchase this any time soon.
i will get it in future
it will work the same
go with the clinique one or heimish one
besides i had to use a ton of it.
more than i usually get
i will not be using this often
not worth all the effort to do it
more work needs to go into this one
i want to work the product into place before that step
i wanted to try this one despite some negative reviews
it didn't feel as if all of my foundation was removed
i at least expect most of the makeup to come off
there were too many things to dislike
after reading so many positives about this product i decided to go ahead
it just was not working out
although this product did remove all my make up
for that reason i did return this product.
had high hope for it
was hoping to find a cheaper alternative from the above
i will continue to use it
a lot of people will probably like that
there was nothing specifically wrong with this product
never use it again!
which is something that i can live with
never had this happen before.
have tried multiple times to use it
having it on regularly to see if it actually makes any improvement in my skin
have been applying it in much smaller amounts
it would probably have more of a positive effect if my skin type were different or if i were older
otherwise it does not live up to its claims
to top it all off i see no improvement in my skin in any way after 3 weeks of using it religiously
agree with the other poster about it not working well with primers or other makeup
it's better just to be used alone.
once again everyone has different skin
i wish i had believed the dozens of people who said that this smells bad
i've never had this happen
which is a let down as us more oily skin types typically struggle most with larger pored
this just seemed to make it worse
it never fully absorbed.
hoping that it would absorb
i wish the underlying scent wasn't so strong or else this would've been added to my cart immediately
it refined it in a way that made my foundation go on more smoothly
like so many others
it is like all the other products on the market with the exception of it being for a good cause
this may be a good product for you
if you are seeking a great primer
not something i was expecting for such an expensive product
i expected it to be different.
they have pretty much done what they've claimed
will definitely return this product.
i decided it was time to take better care of my skin
had high hopes that this could be the one from reading the sephora reviews
wished it did not contain alcohol.
those dark specs are already in the in mask if you look closely enough
wanted something a little heavier
will be happily returning this.
there are other products out there i feel are better
my go to lines have been origins
this set did not give me the 'clean' feeling that i have been accustomed to
there are others out there that do the same for a fraction of the cost
i returned it cause i didn't find any other good uses for it
it seems like it would almost be a night time mask
i will be experimenting more with this product to try to find some sort of happy medium with it
immediately knew i would not even be finishing the sample size
others have felt the exact same way that i did about this moisturizer
it does have good results
thought i would try this due to the excellent reviews
this is the worst moistureizer i have ever tried
that was not the case at all
although it works for many
i see no other benefits
i figure i would try this product as the review where 5 stars
i did keep using it hoping for a change
tried using as little as possible
who has more resilient skin than i do
i think i'll try the sensitive version because i do enjoy the two step process
i figured it was because my skin needed to adjust to the new products
it may have been the oil
knew it was going to be a quality product
i wish i had gotten the firmarine set
as it probably would have been a better match for my skin
yet somehow completely failed to remove any of my makeup at the same time
the process was not pleasant however
usually just a wipe will do so my expectations were kinda high
i will definitely continue to use it
i wanted to make an exception for this
like another review said
i tried this a two different ways.
other than that the product worked great
i can already tell a different on face.
i like the idea of a matched double cleanse set--i haven't seen many of those so far--
i love the nicely designed travel box they come in
other than that however
its definitely meant to be used together
can't have one without the other
however to formula did not work for me
i did not feel it adequately cleaned my face like i hoped
the times that i did use it
there are better products
me on the other hand would only buy the oil.
i am guessing it is because it is the trial size.
other than that great product!
both were so messy to use.
i would use the oil first
i would be interested in trying the charcoal bar though
have not allowed enough time to see the results
i've used just about everything out there including homemade masks using some pretty interesting ingredients
i could hardly get through one use.
unfortunately this will be going back :
i will stop using this as it emphasized my fine lines
this will last you for a very, very long time.
that was enough for an eye
i do not suggest purchasing this product for mature skin at all
it must have spread a little
i think it may under perform
that is probably the reason i rarely break out
while i like that this is a 'cleaner' product
i still use it only sometimes.
which is saying a lot for my skin
hopefully people will have the heart to let this be posted
maybe i'm using this wrong based on how many people loved it
was hoping this would be more of a balm
other people could smell it even when they were a few feet away
it absorbed too quickly to really work there
knew to use it very sparingly
which isn't great when i intended to use it throughout the day at work
i would have to start off by saying this has very cute packaging
not for all over the face
as soon as i did
i think this should be reintroduced as a highlighter only
'm always on the lookout for things that claim to be illuminating
could benefit from what it has to offer?
i got two of these as 100 point rewards
i would not wear this alone ever which is what it's being advertised for
out more with this stuff on
i would use this as a highlight touch rather than apply it to my entire face
i can't image anyone over the age of nine wanting to use this product
however i'd only use it when i'm going out for a wild night on the town or add a small amount to my daily moisturizer when i'm going make up less
i've never said this about a product
i can't even be happy that i spent 100 points on this
i will give it one star because it could work well as not a moisturizer
to be nice i'm going to assume there are distinctly different batches
so the bright side is that i didn't pay any money for it
this however, was a bit of a fail for me.
you will have the same product
this might be okay as just a highlight
even still i had a couple of friends come up to me
unfortunately i will not be using it in the future
has one that is $16
hope i can find a way to return in.
its not a must have product
was really hoping this would help
considering the price, it should do a lot more.
for a broke college student i was excited to be able to afford this after saving some money
the parts i didn't like was the microglitter
maybe i need to keep using it to see results
although it does work well for that purpose
i will be returning
as far as this strong scent people are complaining about-what?
i will continue to use so see if i see any more changes
i’m happy to have had the chance to try this product complimentary thanks to influenster
while it was hydrating i didn't see any difference in the fine lines even though i used it for just over a week
it was so small that i do not really see any difference between the "before
i got a very sparse amount to try in my package
the only reason i am giving it three stars is because it did not help with my circles very much
was happy to try this one
maybe i need to use it longer for results.
which i found was the most disappointing one out of all of the lancôme products i received to try
was hoping this might be the one
i think i was able to use it for a good week.
when i would apply it
just not sure if it's making any long term changes since
not sure maybe i have to use the product for a longer period of time
maybe the sample size that they sent was not enough for me to see a change
either way i feel there is better out there.
at least not enough to spend the money or add another step to my morning routine
am not able to speak to the long term benefits of the product
the few times i have used it i do like it
with that being said
unfortunately there wasn't enough product in the sample to last that long
i only started using it after i saw that it could be used as primer
was happy with the results
i knew when i put it on the first time i'd likely have a skin problem with it
see if there's any improvement as i have only used it consecutively for about 5 days so far
too bad because all of the other products are great
i should have returned it.
if your skin is less difficult than mine
but that is about it.
for me to keep using it
will be returning it
the fragrance was just not what i expected from a somerville product
i didn't break out from this which is nice since my skin can sometimes be sensitive to new products
definitely get a sample of this before buying if possible
it's says that it can be used for all ages
there are many other products out there that are cheaper
there is is no need for fragrance in a product like this
then i would get this all the time
i tried using less
with all the serums out there i would never use this one
it did not wear under make up at all.
i'll keep trying it to be sure.
not for wearing by itself
using it by itself all over the face is not flattering
cause when i use it now
with the full size i feel like i have to put on so much to get it to be even close to how the one in the sample worked
it could just be me?
no i got find a new primer :(
now i'm less than eager to try anything else by this line
i usually love anything that is from the first aid br
i also loved how it made my face glow from within
going for a more natural look
for people like me who wear a full face everyday
i think it would be a nice product for those who are truly truly dry skin
i really would not consider it to be the "super powerful" product that it claims to be
i figured this would help with those areas
i wish i had looked at the ingredients before i decided to try this out
purchased: green teai decided to try it out since there were really good reviews
i would use again
this one is not one of them
not the end of the world
overall, would say good for travel.
i really wanted to love these because they were such a great deal
you could find lots of better drug store cleansers that work way better than this
t's not the end of the world
not sure i'll try another from this line based on my experience
i also realized that its not as inexpensive as i thought when i ordered it
though i will continue to use up what i currently have
it did not seem to perform better than others i have tried
the cream is amazing but this mask was a fail.
there are so many better products on the market
it will help other products stay on the skin longer
there are many other products that work just as well for this
i felt nothing from having it on.
i am not sure if this could be a possible reaction to the cream?
all opinions are my own
i prefer to have no fragrance in my face products if possible
if you are interested in getting one of these
more product to see if it would make a difference
did not work well with my foundation
maybe it works for some foundations
but this did not prime my skin and extend it.
like others have mentioned
which surprised me as i thought it would be more "milk" like or at least lighter
never seemed to dry down no matter how much time that i gave it
this cream also did not provide much in the way of priming
it did not improve my skin at all
giving it two stars because i feel like it could work for the right person
after a few weeks of using it i find that it's not as amazing as the woman described it to be
although it does absorb quickly
i wish they could find better ingredients
well, this was not the answer.
which in fairness may not be from this
nothing has ever done that to my face before
will be returning it but i liked it.
i agree with the other reviews saying it is like water on your face
i won't be purchasing the full size bottle merely on the fact that i think i would go through this way too fast
thus was the only new product for my skin that i had tried during that time
never used it again
may work for others but definitely not for me.
would not consider my skin to be very sensitive
it won't be making it into regulars use for me
wish they would come up with something with a little bit more oil control
this is not that at all
maybe by itself it could work
not a terrible travel option
it should come in light
if this came in at least several shades it could be a 4 or even 5 star product
many other lighter or darker toned people would not be able to know as well
this most likely will be returned
its a no from me
there is definitely no oil control here.
i will be returning this.
as i've used many different products on my face to try out what helps to keep my oil under control
this product is the first one to actually make me break out
the break outs are not worth it though.
maybe would wear better without foundation over- haven't tried yet
also did not last very long for me.
so although this works
so why would i bring this instead- plus it might all leak out again
this says that it can be applied before
i like to start by saying this product has one job
they looked exactly the same before
have tried it twice now and will be returning.
have found not a lot of products that do a good job of controlling it
i will continue using it until it's gone
night like suggested seems a little too much i use once a day along with the serum
or the use of all 3
see how that works since i have seen a lot of good reviews about that product
why companies keep coming out with sunscreens like this when there are far more lightweight
i just wish the cream was a little more richer
i will give it two stars
way too expensive to have these problems
anyway will keep using it
will be returning this product.
was happy to try a new one
it seems that the package was less than halfway full because 3 pumps of product times 4 uses should not equal an empty bottle
i still use it about twice a week because i really want it to work
i must be one of the few people that is not a fan of this product
unfortunately there was nothing baby like about my skin after using this:
i will be returning this for sure.
this is not to say that other drunk elephant products will do the same
i do think more oily or all over normal types will benefit from this
other exfoliators did can do much better jobs than this
this one however is not for me.
trying to be very gentle with it now to get it back to where it was
maybe i expected too much after reading reviews.
saw no effects although lets be fair- only used once
i could not use this product.
this would have done real damage to my skin if i would have tried to stupidly tough it out for any length of time
unfortunately i will be returning this.
i kept using it because i thought it may be something else in my routine or that my skin was having a moment
now i use all kinds of foundation
i'd even "break up" with this for a while to see if something else was causing the breakouts
should have returned it when i still could have:(
i always give skincare about a month or sometimes two before i write it off as a bad product for me because i know it takes time for it to develop with the body chemistry
i would not use it in the summer
i suggest not to use it under your foundation.
there are far better
i recommend starting there first.
i can get similar results with any argan oil
the bottle the sample size comes in also makes it a little difficult to get sufficient product out so perhaps that could be hindering my review as well
milk is so much better
this oil doesn't work any better or worse than oils that i already have
i would use it again if received as a gift
try the travel size for yourself before committing to the big one
i only ever used this at night because it felt so heavy
each time i have to apply twice as much product as usual in order to reach all corners of my face
this is coming from someone with normal skin
i just couldn't because despite its claims
even i literally haven't even worn make up when i always at the very least wear a sheer coverage foundation
this is one of them
expected more from this honestly
will stop using immediately
or that maybe this would be a better day-time protective
i agree with other reviewers who say the product is heavier
for the price i would expect something lighter-feeling
especially since its description claims it can be used day
no matter how long i have it sitting on my face before i put on foundation
perhaps it takes longer than a week for my skin to be conditioned to accepting it
this one might be the reason i have breakout on my chin
which is not normal
how it has changed my skin in the ways i never thought possible
which might turn some people off
can seem like a bit much at first
add more if necessary
i feel like some of my small breakouts could be attri
i would recommend it for that only.
i still have a decent amount of product left
so would be wasting a lot of product
honestly both products together made my face more dry than before
i've never experienced something like that from any other soap
this formula would probably be great for a normal/normal to combination skin
i give it two stars because it did clean
it was surprising because it specifically states it can be used for dry skin
maybe just better at cleansing than i wanted
will be returning this product
i suggest if you have combination skin to stay away from this
i've used plenty to different products on my face
by the way i used it 3 times to confirm this actually happened with this
i am finally switching to another product because this has not been helpful at all
they never got better or worse!
also does not absorb as quickly as some of the others i have tried
it did not work for me even when applied only over the dry areas of my face
i will return as soon as possible.
i found out how much it cost
have to say that back then i had no real knowledge of skincare
some people swear by it
i find i like to use it more at night than under makeup
doesn't spread well which means i have to use much more of it than i'd like
not at all what i would expect out of a moisturizer that typically costs over $150
the products that usually work well on me stung
leaves it more sensitive than before
maybe i'm too young to use it.
wishing days of using it
i must say that this cream by far is the worst cream i have ever put on my face
use your money elsewhere.
there are many others available that are just as good for much less money
i will not use again
for years i wondered if this cream would be the answer to my worries
i would like to start off by saying that i have pretty good skin no major issues except for really really bad dark circles
there are many things that i like about this product
there are also a few that i don't like
this product is great for those no make-up days.
the only real issue i had with the product was that depending on which foundation i paired it with
something i've never really had an issue with considering i lean more oily
are you supposed to use it before or after foundation?
however all opinions are my own
make sure you are not using too much as this can result in your foundation balling up
not enough to be game changing
i think they are average
at first i was a little confused on how i was supposed to apply this product
i've tried this product a few different ways
the best one to work for me is as a pore reducing serum on days i'm not putting any foundation over top
i didn't feel like it did an adequate job of blurring to be worn on its own
if i apply make-up after this
i'll definitely keep using this
i’m still trying to figure it out.
gave this a try because of the good reviews
it is different than anything i've used before.
definitely a go-to on those no makeup days for me
used it before looking through all ingredients
once i stop using this, all bumps are gone.
i feel as though if my skin was different i would
i expected something different
which it does quickly
all of the reviews for this product got my hopes up
for a person in their 20's
take far too long to be absorbed
i wish i could post pictures because i took some!
unfortunately it hasn't been as effective as i would have liked
was hoping for better results
not as much as other products
found that this product did nothing to help that at all
as this did not help either i will be returning
this was not it
i'd rather spend double that for something that actually works for me
guess the other one worked better for me
always 've been used oil for my last step for my face
i guess i was the only one judging by these reviews
there's no reason to spend more than $10 on this product
which is my fault for not paying attention to the size
i'll start with this- if you have sensitive eyes
i really had high hopes for this serum after doing alot of research
i find my self reaching for other products to help after using this "moisturizer" when i have never had to do that before
going to have to return these.
most of us would like to use the product for a few months
a pump of some sort or a tube would be better.
can use the rest of my routine on them
i doubt i'll keep using it
i think i'm more inclined to stick with more natural skin care products that have a clear purpose
thought this would be my go to product
might work for most
i want to say that as a positive
can say confidently that this one is really not that potent
not as much as i had hoped
i could see if being too much for those sensitive to strong fragrance
it may help keep my oils at bay for a little bit longer than if i went without it
after running out of my usual go-to i was thrilled to try a 7-day supply of this because the one-day sample just isn't enough to see a difference
can tell that this isn't moisturizing as well as i would need it to on the other parts of my face
i'll continue to use it until it's gone
i will continue to use this for a while until i run out
figured their hydrator would prove to be just as good
i also feel it did not help with oil control.
likewise daily sheer suncreen does not go well over it
i experienced no breakouts which is saying a lot because almost any product tends to break me out
was really hoping this would work for oil control
this was the only product of the three i received for free from influenster in return for my honest review that i wasn't super jazzed about
what i care more about is the product.
working in the cosmetic industry i can already tell you a lot of people will not like it
so with that said
i can see this product being
it did not help to keep my oil under control
i did not use all three products in the line
i will stick with those
all opinions are my own
i would recommend the other 2 products over this one
i will be giving it another try come summer.
which is great cause i have been using the br
the directions enclosed don't make it clear that you are only mixing the product once- not every time you use it
it was hard to know what was a proper dose
felt it was necessary for this
i feel like with as much money as i spent
it could have a better container
at the very least
i don't normally write reviews because most products end up working for me for the most part
we have the same skin type
maybe not the best for this purpose.
however i will most likely have to return it
like some other reviews here
my eyes are usually not sensitive to products either
there must be something in this that makes it just unbearable for me to use
i expected way better,
will sadly be returning
i also liked the fact that you were getting the benefits of hope in a jar moisturizer with it
would make a great base.
definitely will be returning to sephora
heard so many good things about this product
that is not the case!
sadly, ,this one has to go back.
got this wanting a lighter
i figure anything with that strong of a scent can not be healthy for my skin
there are better smelling things out there that get the job done just as well
there are so many skincare you can choose from
unfortunately i know this sample will not be enough to try it for no more than a week to give a good review
sepora needs to do better in quality control when sending out items in their playbox
i couldn't believe that it was the worst of the worst items i've paid for
i might as well have been using a no name face cream
while their other products feel nice
not as great as some of their others
i prefer the the other lines over this one
then hope for the best
this might be a good bet
the tube is a lot bigger than whatever is inside
i just much higher hopes
didnt absorb too well either
you can get way better oils than this.
there are far less expensive facial oils that do the same
or anything else that might have affected it
since using this i have gotten a lot
as someone who is really into home remedies
i ordered it as soon as it was available
i will keep it to try in the winter or just keep it for my h
honestly nothing different with it compared to others
can be used the exact same way as this "elixir"
i tried it a few different ways
that single use of an expensive oil is not reason enough to hang on to this
but it is not any of the things it claims to be.
have tried it so many different ways
after applying it on the skin or adding it with my foundation
maybe this will work for other skin types
i got this product as as a trial to see what the hype was all about for this product
even though i only used two drops
there are better products out there.
tried to give it multiple chances
nothing for some reason on my skin only work two times after that leave my skin so creasy
thought i had to try it
with that being said
i personally should have known this would more than likely break me out
i wish it could have worked for me
the product did not work for me as described
i do not want to risk future breakouts through the use of this product
can only speak from my own personal experience
in the end, i did return this product.
the salesperson at sephora told me it may be used a as a primer
this oil made them look so big
i will be returning this very soon
there needs to be more product for it being $54
and you get such a small amount of it.
other than that did not get any use out of it
need something for 49 year old skin
i would go as far as to say it dried it out
the rose gold one is so much better don't waste your money on this
a lot of people are comparing it to water
perhaps i should give it more time
would probably work best on someone who already has great soft skin that just wants a little extra boost
i used it once
i am seriously shocked at how many people i follow pushed this product
the only time i breakout from products is when they are filled with a bunch of garbage ingredients
i would like it better as a c
i will use this up
continue to try to make this work
will definitely be returning
saw so many reviews that said just that
this may not be for you
there are so many better products out there for the price
none of whom actually perform actual product testing
it really is none of those things.
it is no different than applying water
i wish both were out of stock because it is absolute garbage
i will use the rest of the bottle
i learned my lesson that internet hype is sometimes just that or paid for
i'll be sure to have some fun with it as it does make highlighters
which i originally thought might be because of a new sunscreen i started trying at the same time
would give zero stars if possible
there are other primers out there
i would give it three stars because it had no effect
my main issue was the fact that i paid $54 for it
unfortunately, i had to return the product.
i like a lot of their products
i wanted to say that although it says to use a plentiful amount
i can name several creams that do a better job for a fraction of the cost
this one however is very different
i am debating whether to return it or not at this point
there are better options out there, sorry boscia.
this can be too light
a half of not using it
i will have to return it
could be worn easily under make up
i will be returning it
even worse it made my pores look larger than they are
here are the ingredientsin order: water
will be returning it
unless they can bring the old version back
this may work for you
the fact that it will not absorb is extremely disappointing
do no be fooled by those asserting that this is simply a renaming
i hoping to make sure beauty enthusiasts will not be duped into thinking this is the same product or some kind of upgrade
not nearly as smooth as i feel it should have been
i wish this would have worked out
so far 2 products were great
there are better products out there
as a regular additional step it's alright for the face
there's too many better ones out there.
but this is no 'pore extractor' as it claims.
too expensive to keep for only that reason
i mean the reviews are bomb right?
thought that this might've actually been the one thing to help get rid of them
i used it once
the only reason i haven't returned it yet is because i still have hope
also because i haven't been in store yet since i got it
thankfully most of them are at the end of the list
applied it differently to see if that would help
should have known, too good a claim to be true.
should not be advertised as such
besides that i would have given it 5.
i think there are better products with overall value
i wonder if the shipment is lost or something because i've never experienced something so bizarre
unfortunately the reviews are right
i used it once
the amount of product felt like too little
unlike any other i have ever tried
after the second use my skin didn't seem very different
for some reason masks can often have this effect on my skin where it does something the first time
with so many other br
i think you can find other options that work much better for a lower price
as this does help to get a better fit
i think this mask would better fit someone who had dry because my face felt worse afterwards
i'll probably purchase again just to see how good the results are
as for the results itself it was no better or worse than any other sheet mask out there
i'll never be using this brand again.
i think there are better products on the market that beat this lane for sure
after using this as directed i had no results at all
it would have been okay if it weren't for the fact that the next morning there were yet more pimples
safe to say i won't be using this product again
this product had no results on my skin one way or the other
this could be better al
this could be better al
i used it exactly as it said
by the end i was just so done
it can only be used once
bought this thinking it would be good for my sensitive skin
i will not be buying it again because there are many
i also live in a place with high humidity so that may make a difference as well
so this likely works better for dry skin that would absorb better
that was the worst idea ever
which i'm just not seeing
i'll continue to use it until it's gone
3 stars for the product that might work for some
as i so wanted it to work out
possibility that breakouts might happen
not as much as other products i've tried
if anyone out there has the same skin type i would be cautious about spending $$$ on this product
be amount of product that there is
i gave it a try because other reviews with similar skin types to mine were saying how amazing it was for their skin
i did like the feel of it and had high hopes.
for some reason it didn't feel as smooth as the sample
i wanted to love this product because i tend to be more on the oily side
i ended up returning it because for the price it wasn't worth keeping it:/ i wish it would have worked
i think maybe they were too old because it was very heavy
while i know one little one time sample isn't enough to truly test a product out
maybe if this came in a mattifying formula it would work better
will have to return for a refund because it's not living up to the hype for me
after reading all the reviews i was hoping this would be the end all be all in a jar
sadly, will be returning.
like the description even says will make it work extremely well
the way it absorbed quickly into the skin that i would like it
that was not the case
if you are on the dried side this might be the product for you
the only downside is that it doesn't leave my face brightened like i hoped a product with vitamin c would
this was not it
figured this would be similar
will have to keep using it to see
i used my bi points to purchase the sample wish i could've continued to use it to see if the results would be great
not what i was hoping for though
have not been disappointed with everything i've tried thus far
i could have gotten with a far less expensive cream
assumed i would love this one just the same
it definitely did not reverse them or slow the aging process because my lines are most definitely worse than when i started this serum
unfortunately that did not prove to be worth it in my case
most of the other products are pretty good
while their is nothing wrong with it
just have no motivation to open a second container when it doesn't do more than their other great face moisturizer does
i'll preface by saying that i have very bad dark circles -probably much worse than what other reviewers are claiming to have
so the ingredients should theoretically stay fresh for a longer period of time
they almost always have some sort of results
without having a clue how much product was even left
i am really so glad that sephora has a good return policy because i will have to take both of these back
they felt like they were absorbing
really don't see how they could have been absorbed in the skin
how they can be effective
i could not be more disappointed
it might be my skin type
i hope it works for others
i hope it can work well for others
so no help in that area either
i will keep it
after a few use i am yet to see any difference.
s than i would like to
unfortunately, i will be returning this.
my original review was not posted so here we go again
you should feel clean after using it
i've liked several other things from the de line
if i shut it completely all times why it only leaks some of the time
i don't know how to actually rate this as i only got to use it a couple of times before it leaked out all over my medicine cabinet
i think the foaming part might be the issue
although i had to return this product because it didn't work for me
i would still recommend others trying it
hopefully they go back to the pump style.
i also don't like that a bit of product is wasted every time you close the cap
definitely cannot travel with it
which is too bad because it would be easier than carrying the soap bars
i 've had no issues with that.
unfortunately the more i use it
still debating on whether or not i'm going to return it
since i have a lot of other cleansers i prefer over this one
very disappointed in this product since the other de products have all been hits for me
i would not recommend this to people with sensitive skin at all
did not expect it to be so harsh on the eyes
it does not separate from the bottle
i'll definitely be returning this product.
i will be returning this product because the packaging is not safe for travel
so i will definitely be returning it now.
the real problem i have with this cleanser is that as it is in a stick form
issue i had is that the cleanser runs out very very quickly
plus for some reason reusing this on my face bothered me when other stick products don't seem to phase me
because i kept being tempted to "try it again "
i will use it again
i will use up what i have
instead they get everywhere.
i will be returning this
i would be careful if you have sensitive skin
much bigger than the actual product in it
i will finish using this one
didn't feel too strong about this product enough to re-purchase in the future
although i must say
so tiny it should be free!!
only to get 1 use out of!
i might not have used the correct amount
it isn't any different than their other masks.
there are so many masks out there
just try another one
you need a lot of product for coverage
there is definitely other masks out there that can do the same as this one with an actually decent scent
i would definitely not use it on a regular basis
i would definitely re-use this
this shouldn't be kept on as long as it says
like many of the other reviewer's
would have been better if it was gel just pump on my h
often feel that it is not clean still because the cleansing properties are really subpar
do not purchase this product if you are looking to replace a different
maybe not great enough to spend $20 every other week on a new one
i read the reviews about how it very quickly would shrink
it will be gone quickly
i would not recommend due to that fact.
it did a decent job everywhere other than the eye area
the biggest issue i have with it though
only if you keep top on
the $20 price point does seem a bit high for something that clearly has a two week lifespan
i can think of any number of products out there they work better
would be great for travel
first off, there is no case.
will be returning this item for something that i am more likely to use
two stars because i like the product.
i've tried other fresh products before that i like
though not nearly as bad as when i was younger
wish it had worked because it did look nice in my collection
this is probably the one i've liked the least
maybe the company could make a perfume like this in the future?
but sadly, i will be returning.
decided to try out one of their own products
hoping with continued use
not wanting to give up on it too quickly
just not the results
sadly i will be returning this.
this is such a fail for me.
not a need to have item
throughout that time i've used some sephora br
i can already see that this serum will be used up very fast
also it ran out a lot quicker than i expected.
it might be great for anti-aging
i would have given it 3 stars
the product did work work as well for me
that can be sensitive at times
would be able to deal with it a little better had the product actually worked for me
i continued to use it for a month as a realize that it can take time for skin to adjust to some products
i will be returning this product.
have not been using it long enough to see major changes
i'll give it two stars because it is easy to use
to make sure it wasn't the other new products that were breaking me out
i feel like this is one of those products that seems like its working only when you actually have it on your face
just generally worse looking
others seem to have great luck with it however
bought this online because sephora does not offer the hope is not enough serum that they carry in the store
so far no results
although i do not mind the smell if the product will deliver the desired results in the long run
i do not see any long term effects as yet
even the best skin can be better
just want to end with the note that i almost 100% of the time agree with the majority of the reviewers on sephora on the products i buy
this one just did not live up to all the 5 star reviews
they say you need to use a product for a month to really show any results
no one can get near your face
might be different for others.
i expect a little more when this costs as much as it does
the reason why i gave this an average rating is because personally
if you look passed these two factors
i used it twice to be sure
if you are not either of those, give it a shot.
what other reviews have been saying is yes
i think i'm alone in holding this opinion
will sadly be returning
thought this might help
in fact they seemed to be the exact same before i had put the balm on
i will continue to use this product until it runs out
nothing special or out of the ordinary
nothing special about it at all.
not everyone has skin meant for this product
all opinions are my own
so unfortunately i'll have to stop using this item
the more i use it
none of these ingredients should be applied to your face
also wish it was a pump
my only complaint is that it is very sticky once you have applied it
was hoping this product would be a home run for my dry skin
this might be a good option for you
it might not be enough
was very anxious to try it out
was hoping it might have been some other addition to my routine
i tried 4 different types
this might be one for you
so disappointed because i feel like the rest of their products i own are revolutionary
here are my first impressions:
was excited to try it out in hope that it would help out my dark spots
at the very least
other than that, not too impressed.
i didn't find this to be helpful at all
i might only use it on the bottom half of my face from now on though
i've only used this mask once
would still use it though!
by applying amount just enough to cover my whole face
for the price i feel like i should have seen something
was so excited to try it that i immediately put it on
if it wasn't for the fact that this mask made my skin soft i would only give it 1 star
i expected so much more
i would ask for a sample before trying this as it seems that it's worked for others
there are a few others like myself
i still put it on in hopes of seeing some of the promised results
overall, this isn't a must have.
then they have to call it 'energy boosting'
for those who don't normally use foundation
i just wish it provided more coverage
i didn't anticipate it having an almost dry
which is one way i pick a product
all opinions are my own
i would have expected something a little more
thought this would help smooth it out
i don't have many lines to improve
i will try this product again
i don't think 7 days was long enough to see the potential full results
that will sometimes happen when i start using a new product
i do think this product is worth trying out for a longer period of time
i didn't see any other results than that.
however i don't think testing this product for 7 days was actually enough time to see actual changes in my skin
i think it would take at least 2 weeks or longer to see true results
i would continue using it
my face tone may have been a bitttt more even
simply because i don't have that amount of cash to throw at my skincare all at once
i highly doubt i'd be able to use it if my skin were any oilier
all opinions are my own
while using clarins double serum i had no issues in that area what so ever
i feel i would have to use at least half a bottle or a whole bottle to see aging benefits
i think i would consult the sephora staff prior to purchasing this to see how it could best fit into your personal skincare routine
you may need to use it longer than i did to see more results
as much as i liked these results
unfortunately this wouldn't be at the top of my list
here are the pros for me.
now for the not so good.
maybe i needed to use it longer
t could have easily been that product
i think this may be a better product for more mature skin
i may consider re-trying this during the winter.
as the 4th day in it didn't help out my skin much rather than make it feel rougher
however it simply is not a product that i can use
thanks influenster for allowing me to give this product a try
did not observe her quickly.
it would be much easier to review positively
no, unless it were cheaper.
at least give decent size samples so customers can see if it works over a couple of weeks
it did live up to being lightweight
in fact it made them worse
when i read the reviews on this i instantly thought " i must have it "
i've already used so much in the attempt of it maybe working
i found that the majority of all the great reviews were left by employees of the company or their friends
if you look at all the review dates
all happen to have five full stars
there are a few new reviews
maybe i would trust those more
there are even more
i think it will suit all skin types.
i really thought the reviews were helpful
it may be different for you.
i also did feel like my skin looked more alive
have to be cautious as to what i layer on top of it
i find this more tricky to use than what i usually prefer
will use what i have
there are much better out there
it felt like a film that just say over my face
thought that this product could help with that
unfortunately the cons outweigh the pros so therefore i will be returning this product
unfortunately though my skin would eventually react to this product
i know it was this product because it is the only product i changed in my routine
use it every night without fail
albeit this product is not for me
was expecting a lot more from this product
the smell is quite strong so that can be off putting to many
if it keeps showing results, i can deal.
this is probably just personal preference
would not suggest this product.
i kept having all these breakouts as a result.
but unfortunately am going to have to return it.
this is probably great for people who are not acne-prone
if it was a bit more subtle it would be much higher rated
i think this product would be much better for those with sensitive skin if ole henriksen did not incorporate artificial fragrance
i hope i can still return this
this is not the one
i initially thought i would tough it out
i keep this one
it will not take off any of your more durable eye make-up
i think it will last a very long time.
for the most part it seems to do the same as everything else i've used
it would work great until i realized how bad the chemicals were on my sensitive skin
i like a lot of other stuff from this line
works well but not over the top.
we will see if continued use wow's me
it was also because of this that i had to use more of this product
same issues with those
unfortunately this just isnt one of them
which is not what i was expecting from this
which is why i gave this product 3 stars
overall i don't see myself purchasing this once the trial size i have is finished
there are other great moisturizers i love a lot more than this one
this make me breakout in places i haven't before!
will look for another product
i've never been so disappointed in something i've purchased at sephora
also i find it doesn't go as far as many others.
t was difficult to apply make-up on top afterwards
i always want to purchase sets from ole henriksen as i like their other products
i avoid them all together
for some reasons it doesn't absorb well
i wish i could say that it lived up to the reviews
for the most part it hasn't really helped with any of my concerns
otherwise i would have been a very unhappy customer
it has so many great reviews though
as many other commentors have said before me
i hope others have better luck.
didn't absorb as much as i'd hoped
i would advise any individual suffering from acne to stay away
there is no way i can wear this during the day
t's better to apply it in the evening or the make up will be scary
even seems to help with my break out frequency
without which i’d be returning this
sadly i fell into that statistic of people it did not work out for
i would also say to keep your expectations realistic because it's a solid serum
i think this may be the cause of my breakouts.
i kept using it because i hoped it wasn't this product
i assumed it was just a coincidence or maybe another new product i had been using
when they are highly comedogenic it's most likely going to be a problem for anyone who experiences acne
i am giving this product two stars only because it did not cause me to break out
usually when i switch products i will see at least some improvement or i will have a horrendous breakout
i did break out from this product when i used it consistently
as i do not use it closely enough
i think it would be best to use this during the colder months
as much as i wanted to like this product
no matter how small amount i apply
i must say that this moisturizer is the worst one i've ever tried
twice i was disappointed with the outcome
i usually get a wow feeling after testing most of their products
i can see how the scent can be offensive
did not provide much benefits for me personally
figured that it was due to me switching products
i will be returning this product.
will not be ordering this skin care again.
i will admit i have good skin to begin with
i appreciate the way it is made especially since i cannot use any retinols
i will keep it because ii am hoping for a miracle
so when i first applied it i was expecting that.
if you put makeup on top of this it would be very hard to blend
what all these other reviewers are doing different
however this is best to be used at night
maybe for some women, but not for me.
s to be able to spread it smoothly
i think this is better suited for spot-treatment or very
i also found it incredibly hard to remove.
when i used it
i've never been this sensitive to a product before
after reading reviews clearly i'm not the only one with this problem
stay away from this product if you have sensitive
i would have to take it off
even though i did not even apply it to my under eye area or close
i most likely will not order this again unless the scent is changed
i used it once
i will be returning.
unfortunately i will not be able to use.
some even less expensive then this one
as soon as you open it
they changed the formula somehow
i noticed that i had to use this only every other day or less
because i have found plenty of less expensive moisturizers that work better
i knew for sure that i would have to return this
i can only have it on for 6 minutes the most
i'll give it a month to see if it still works as well
i could still smell it under my foundation throughout the day
i received this as a gift so don't even have the option of returning this
am i the only one here that gets my eyes irritated while applying this product??
they way it felt on my face
even worse as the product gets older
when i initially put it on i was happy because i have dry skin
there have been less than desirable changes in some of the other products too
this would probably be much better suited to someone who wants a very light moisturizer
determined that philosophy's hope in a jar would be the best given all the great reviews
i found that i had to use a lot of product to spread it on my face the way i wanted to to
i think i'll try renewed hope in a jar as it appears to be fragrance-free
this proved to be neither
keep using it almost every night cause i believe it helps :
will definitely be returning : (
i will likely be returning to a much less expensive product
i like the version with spf much better which i also tried out in travel size
it is not their best
so while i will use what i have
there are some left
also, i felt it added to my oil issue.
it does seem to work for a day or two
does not protect my skin like the previous version
this might be a good product
i am very disappointed especially considering the fact that i do not normally have dry skin
i will continue to use it for another month before i completely dismiss it
it is only getting worse
a weaker formula than what i already have
i may prefer it during winter time
possibly made it worse
it hasn't worked wonders like the other product had
what convinced me that my unceasing breakouts was more than just purging was that i was getting really gross
this might be hg for some skin types
after doing more research elsewhere would have never bought
the only thing different that i used was this product
it didnt really work as what they claim
considering how pricey this was i wasn't ready to give it up yet
but i really should of gave it up.
really had high hopes for this product
this would be better for sensitive skin.
unfortunately i must be one of the few ones for whom it did not work
i may need to start using it more often or i may actually need a higher dose of retinol
i gave it 3 stars because it may just need more time with some minor modifications with routine
for that money it should do much better
some people said that for some it may be too harsh on the delicate eye area
may actually cause more harm than good
some people seem to have had great results
have been disappointed to find that it has not managed to improve my skin very much at all
very disappointed on spending the money on something like this
'm certain out was the product
more tired than they were before
though this would be a miracle
i've yet to see any results
i still feel tight or near to not have applied
a less costly product will do the same
which had always been a must
that is not the case
unfortunately i will be returning it
this did not help with that
it would be nice of it had a little more hydration
probably because i don't have problems with eye areas if i sleep well
initially when i apply it
will see what happens after a month or so
seems to have some benefit
i only use it in the am
my job frequently requires me to work long hours
something that could possibly take away dark circles
i will continue to search for another product to help with my issues because i'm not sure this is doing the trick
they had other products that they recommended
it is the exact opposite that i asked for.
it doesn't work any better than what you could pick up at the drug store for half the price
this one is only so-so
still have about 1/3 of the bottle 3 months later so you don't need much
i am not sure if it has made any difference long term
that has always been a problem for me
will continue using this product until it is gone
not the best fresh product i have tried.
i love so many other fresh products
might be better for other skin types
i will try to find other alternatives
only because it is nicer to travel with
i found for me with the bar you can control the consistency of the mask
had about 5 uses out of it
can be used every day
will definitely be purchasing after i use up some of my other masks
but i still like it and would finish it
am not happy with it for two reasons
i will be returning this product
most likely would switch back to it once i finish this tube
so far i've had no problems with the other 2 products
never again will i use this product
honestly makes me extremely hesitant to use the other products after this
not heavy enough to be used as one
plenty of other products do the same thing better
they claimed they didn't change the formula
they must have with the name as my skin is still dry even after using this
i never have such situation before
it seems i will need to replace it very soon as it is already running low
i would not buy it again because i believe there better products that moisture as much as this one
also give a something extra
or if it has an real benefits as i have only been using it for about 2 weeks
this would probably be better for those who can tolerate a lot of fragrance in their products
all of the ones i've used did the same unfortunately
the only draw back is that it doesn't have spf.
other than that there is nothing special about it
as we were out of town i had no choice
this would probably be better for someone with normal or dry skin
i'll probably use this up
every time i use it
should work for you
then you should look elsewhere
thought this would be a good cleanser for me
it would take multiple efforts
they had a great product.
i feel like they might have changed it
this was partially my fault for not reading the instructions earlier on on how to properly use it--which is to use with a cotton pad to remove make up
but even so i gave it a chance.
i've tried using it a number if different ways
it was the only thing i could use for my sensitive
i need to look for another product to replace this with
this is not possible
i also do not believe it is cleaning my face as good as the old product because i have since gotten several pimples
i will be forced to use a different br
really hope that they get the old formula back.
some things don't need to be changed especially when they are excellent
looks like the search will continue.
they changed their formula
it was disappointing to have to return this one.
that was still there as well
i tried it many times.
i tried it for a week to try something new.
it is much more drying than expected :
it looks like i may have to
something is no longer right with this.
needed oil to bring it back to life
before trying this product i had already found a line
i've always wanted to try boscia products
i would recommend trying out the fresh line
even though it doesn't help that much with the oil either :/
not for people with sensitive
i wish i could exchange it for a better product
i got this product because the spot treatment i was using previously was too strong
thought this would be a good choice
i got this specifically for the spot treatment because those are the kind of blemishes i usually get
i feel like this uses too much product to cover the spots i have
when i apply this on it
will probably use this for daytime though
it may be more effective for those with acne that can hurt as the description says it provides relief
the product may or may not work.
returned it because so much product was going to waste
it seemed as though every where i put this spot treatment
this only happened where i put the treatment.
i might as well have been putting grease on my face for all the good this product did for me
really wanted to find a new spot treatment that worked
would recommend trying because acne medicine works differently for everyone
i like how this is a 'natural' alternative
didn't see any results from using it at all.
i will be taking this back as well
im not sure why there are such high reviews on this product
i found that it did not work as a spot treatment at all
trying to hold out hope it would eventually work
it certainly did not help reduce the pimples i already had
i will need to try it again before i'm convinved
with that being said
i will probably write another review once i've used up the entire bottle
this product came highly recommended when i said that my concerns were about my black bags
it also didn't absorb as fast as i would have liked since i rub my eyes a lot
even then i could feel some of the product still remaining
unfortunately i'll have to return it.
at the same time did not improve my under eye area
did not improve or even help either one bit.
unfortunately, i will have to return it.
sad because it's more affordable than the alternatives i wanted to try
sophora can help youfind one that gets better reviews
one pump is too much for one use
this is one of their more average ones where it's just good not great
that is not the case.
i also don't think it is great for sensitive eyes which is odd because i was assuming this was a more natural br
i think i will begin my conquest again to find a better eye cream
i will continue to use this
not getting worse either
it may be better for those who only need lightweight moisture
this might be too strong
i'd try next time with less though because i love boscia products
not too see any improvement if someone is already having an issue
have never had this happen before
perhaps this would be better for someone with more "normal" skin
for me that is about it
then do it again because it had so little effect
i will say this worked great as a hand cream.
i am going to see if my skin gets over this so that i can keep using it since i spent all that money on it
tried to see if i could use this instead
no way i can have this on all night
i would like to try some of the other overnight korres products
i kept assuming it was other products
i should of gotten that from the beginning
maybe i haven't been using it regularly enough
i can see it working really well for others
this is one of those rare products that i hated.
other products i've tried from korres though
did they change the formula?
at least didn't create any issue
had to use a tatcha product to combat what this product couldn't take off
why they would even put it in there when i have combo skin as my selection
now that i've used a few others
too many "natural" ingredients that did nothing
it will always have a special place in my memory
'm always hesitant to try new cleansing products
when theirs others just as good
i also find it difficult to get the product out of the bottle
not sure what happened as it used to be formulated different
this was not the case
i will definitely not being using it again
i can use other products that cost a lot less
are so easy to use
it sort of encouraged a breakout that normally wouldn't have been as bad
this may work for someone with less sensitive skin
am not sure why i was having a major problem with murad with this product
i wish i had the same results as other reviewers of this product
not sure if it has actually helped with the redness or not
my skin had been doing fairly well
thought this would be good
may need to change to something different
might try it again after longer-term use -- still on the fence
the results are promising so far
no tube in the bottle for the pump as others have mentioned
as a results very hard to get out of the bottle
makes me use them less often
because i have to struggle every time just to get some cream out
so far i like the product.
especially because i travel a lot
use that money for something that will actually make a real difference for my skin
much worse than before i was using it.
over all i'm not seeing results
could be great for others
there's really no way to tell if it is due to the picture porefect or the other products i began at the same time
is really not worth the 40 dollars if you have sensitive skin
while it helped a little bit, not enough for $40.
this may have been a better fit
well i have to say
this has never happened to me with other products
thought this product would help
is it the product or the fact that my skin is beyond help?
for me, this one hasn't helped.
like so many other products it wasn't mattefying enough
i wish there were more detiled instructions---should i use a toner first---how about a moistureizer over it??
otherwise i will continue to use it.
unfortunately, those day are over now :-(.
this used to be the best product ever
now they have changed the formula
even though i used it for quite a while
have to return it unfortunately.
it was not the case
this also did not help
have not been happy with it
it also hasn't seemed to help it at all either
it did reduce it a little bit
it can work for people with no skin concerns.
i used two bottles to be sure
not been as effective as i hoped it would be based on the other reviews
turned out to be too good to be true-sadly
so after reading all of the reviews for this product i decided to give it a try
for something that is supposed to help with sensitive skin
i know there is probably a ton still on the bottom
i see there is still the pump mechanism to get through
it really did seem to help his under eye area somewhat
perhaps more effective than most of the others
feel i have given it a fair chance
it does not significantly reduce the look of them
i probably used about 1/2 the bottle
might work better on older skin than younger.
it did not look lighter or younger
other than being just an average eye cream i can't say much else
tried it for some time
does not help with lines or circles
waste of money for us older women i think
i've not tried any other product for my dark circles
so that may be the culprit
be easier to use than the mask
it was impossible to use after this
because it is easy to apply
it may be nice as a mask
most definitely not worth the $40-0
as comfortable as you are imagining
which is how long it will take me to erode the brick fully
i would always have to follow up with an actual cleanser
effort trying to make it work for me in various ways
i might use this for travel
for the price i was hoping it can do a little bit better than that
it didn't help clear breakouts or prevent new ones
provided the formula hasn't changed this should still help
should have returned it.
but i find it very hard to use.
felt like i wasted way too much of this rather expensive bar just trying to figure out how to use it correctly
i also had read all the reviews
the good ones made me so hopeful
i should have been more pessimistic
my forty dollars can definitely be better spent else were
cleaning your face should not be this difficult :
just basically using this until is gone
then i'm getting something different
there are cheaper cleansers out there that do the job just as well
consistency can be off-putting
this might be cool for some of you
i think i'm going to exchange it for the milk version try that again
i did return it though because it didn't have the drastic results that i expected
i will continue to use it
find it way too complicated to follow in the morning
does not remove make up very well at night
it just feels like a treat to apply at the end of the day
i would have liked to have been able to read how to use it prior to purchasing
you have to pat your face several time
because i only tried it once
also, makeup does not go over it very well.
it felt more like an oil
for some reason makes my skin produce more oil than it did before i started using this
when i use this it makes it even worse
i would never use it throughout the day
it needs to go back
hope it works for her or just use it on my h
i reach out to other moisturizer instead even though i paid so much money for this
can't return because i already used some
other than that this was a no for me
i am saving the rest for the summer months in hopes that it works for me better when my skin isn't quite as dry
i read that this can help make up stay on
was hoping for the same quality as what i have been used to
it ultimately made my skin much worse
this is just not the case
i used it once.
you can only imagine how much of my foundation actually stayed on by the end of the day
unfortunately it didn't help much by the morning
not what i had hoped or expected.
would not use this by itself because i have really dry skin
lasting results -- not something that temporarily makes it "look" like my skin problems are solved
i would not recommend it for those with sensitive skin
it did make my skin more even though
i thank sephora for letting us sample these products for instances like these
which is more than i can say about most products some to treat this
it would take several months to actually know whether or not it is successful at treating pigmentation
may investigate one of those sources when this runs up
did nothing for me as far as diminishing
it worked the same as any other product out there
try this product as a sample before committing to the real deal
can't say i see any difference in my skin after using it for some weeks now
this could be a good product for you
just to ensure that this product was in fact the single reason for the reaction
'm unsure about the cause for the strong reaction
i want to encourage people to try it for themselves
was free so not a big deal
for as much as this costs i was hoping to tell a difference
was hoping this serum would as well
that was not the case
my expectations were higher because of how good clarins usually is
then this might work for you though
this will definitely be going back to sephora
i decided to give this a try because of its light formula
came to the conclusion that i wanted to try this product based on the positive reviews
i stopped using it for a few days just to make sure that this was the cause of my concern
i keep using the lancome until i find something better for the circles
but i thought it was just average.
it is so minimal that it could just be my imagination
i agree with the so-so comments about this product
when i first started using it i was hoping for an excellent result because of the br
however, it is certainly not the best.
overall i will probably keep using it
as they look any other day
said that he has been using this forever
i did agree that he looked 10 years younger than his real age
this concentrate has nothing to do with that
i usually get much better result when i pay this much money for a product
great ones out there
still see clearly the fine lines
which one would expect for being part of the restorative line
they were like that from the start
which is the best i have ever tried
there are a lot of products that does a better job than this one
make up does apply well over it
like not having it on apart from an infrequent
this might work miracles
i would only recommend this to people with perfect
i chose this as one of my 100 point perks.
have tried so many other products that really give you an instant 'wow' when applied
would probably get used up in a flash
help me look more awake than i feel
maybe my skin is beyond help.
maybe i should lower my expectations.
being a frequent traveller who wants to look fresh
it may have been too great at that for me
it has a way of getting into them
i must have a little in my eyes
it stung so bad that i will never use it again.
it is the worst product i've ever tried.
the older i get
go as long as i can
hoping more product would help
i probably should have returned it
i won't purchase this again as there are several other face washes out there that work well for a much lower price
this could be the result of washinin gmy face 2x a day eitherway
this is probably my least favourite product ever.
-- i was hoping for better results
i believe it was too strong for my sensitive
just not for my sensitive
i also think it made my face break out more.
i used it for two weeks now without anything else than skin irritation
the problem i have is that you need to pump it about 15-20 times to get a good amount of product
will also keep looking
careful with this one
the 'pores no more vacuum' i have very large pore that i have been battling with my whole life
just think this is too harsh for the general population
it is the best i 've used
not heavy at all
plus i can see them more.
i wish i could still return it
i could not give the product less than 3 stars even though i should because it is a good night time moisturizer in the dry winter months
i gave it more than enough time.
not the worst, not the best.
i am willing to give it more time
it should work somehow
each time i tried the products in this line
the only thing that worked to clear up my skin was to return to the products i was using prior to trying this line
not at all like the other products
i can see this working
during the day in order to see how it worked with my other skincare
in my age group that i would try this
mostly happy skin it was before this product
bought it because the good seemed to outweigh the bad
the only pro going for this product
this product might be great for some
this cream did not live up to my expectations
i tried this hoping for a change that would come eventually
shouldent have wasted the time or money
they are still here
i will continue to use the product until it is gone
i should have known after using help me that something like this
this is not worth trying again.
if i could have only one product in this line
i stopped using it beause it started to cause more irritation than anything
this is not the case
that was all it did
did not control oil at all
i just had to try it
i hope is nothing permanent :|
it will be the last.
it will have to be st
perhaps the product inside has also
felt it was not as effective
before you can use even a fraction of the product
i wish they'd come out with smaller packaging.
i will no longer be using
now i can only apply it in select areas of my face
for the money i was expecting a more silky feel.
never got the desired results however i love l'occitane
at first i thought that would be too little
i would have much better appreciated it
i hoped this would be it
i found a few other reviews that had the same problem
might work for some, unfortunately not for me.
for long term every day use i still think milk mixed with rose water would be better for the face than this cosmetic
i hoped this would work
i will admit that it was a soft
for the cost of this lotion you can get much better for less
would welcome a reccomendation for any other product that would do the job
doesn't have the same citrus-type sent that i like about the day product
i used all of this
not sure it will last very long
i will be returning it as i have definitely had better night creams
this was recommended in the store as a product that would address these things
i still think the price is a little steep for such a little tube
my foundation will not stay on my face when i use this product
this was the best moisterizer i used for under my make up
believed this will be good for me
it should be good for customers after the age of 40
it might work for someone who has more seriously "dry" skin
it's so strong that people can smell it on my face throughout the day
this probably isn't any worse than any of the others
i stopped using it because it just seemed like a waste of money
i decided to give this one a try based on the great reviews
so you need quite a bit to be able to blend it on your entire face
this has more or less stopped working
it was far too heavy
had i known that i would not be able to wear it during the day
all in all seems to be a lot of money for soso product
it also didn't absorb into my skin as well as it seems to for most people
isn't noticeably different from something you could get at the drugstore
not cleaning as well as i wanted
it is not for this
obviously very clean after using the product
lotion still works well but we were disappointed.
will return for sure.
the biggest problem with this product is that it is nearly impossible to use any bb cream
thought i could get away with a less expensive item
i find that it makes my make up harder to blend in
find that i am basically foundationless in some places
i may still look for other products
seemed very hesitant to show me other options except for dermadoctor br
thanks to sephora's generous return policy i figured i would try it
i also noticed that i had to use more product quantity than i would normally use for face cream since it was rather thick
than all the many others i've tried
nothing seems to help those so thus product won't be rated on that
it hasn't done much to help fine lines
it's probably better suited for someone in their mid 20's that is starting a preventive routine
never happened to me in my life with any other product
i am going to use it to the end
maybe if i use it for a couple months longer i'll see better results
not sure if i actually saw the results it boasts.
i specifically said i needed something for my dark circles
the other selling point for me was that she made a comment about how the jar was huge
i returned it after trying to use it a few different ways with the same result
maybe i am spoiled by some other eye products in my arsenal that seemed to make more of a difference
still searching for something that will do what it says for my eye area
only thing it did was keep the eye area soft
so far i like this product.
i will rate this higher if after a month or 2 the product gets better
this is a costly $73 waiting game.
the product should be better
i wish i would have just spent less money
i felt this was of no use.
i at least thought the dark circles would have shown an improvement in that short time if it was going to work at all
which is the time he said i would recognize a difference
there are certainly others that i have tried that are better
not as much as i had hoped
as much as i wanted to see a difference
i will not use this again.
not sure it is helping with anything other than dryness
it certainly is better than no eye cream at all
i figured this would help with at least one of my eye issues
my eye bags have been paying for it
will continue using for a bit longer.
i used the whole thing because i kept hoping the results would kick in like the description
too expensive not to work, so i returned it.
had to return it, unfortunately :(
i am very disaappointed in how quickly the product is being used
to make it even worse
with just the right amount
this was not the case
i'll just use this one
really hoped this would be the fix for my under eye problems
really wanted this to be the product that gave me younger looking eyes
need to go to something less potent
figured it was worth it if it worked as it stated
if you are expecting miracles in a month
i still have some oil build up
this one seemed to have good reviews
i would try out other products from this lines
go put those money into better use such as an investment account or something
not looking any different
i must say i was disappointed after my first use
after having it so highly recommended by others on beautytalk
i hoped that this effect might go away after a couple of uses
"this is going to turn out well
it did work well as far as having sensitive skin.
however, it is very so-so.
not for very long
too much work for the results which were okay at best
i could deal with that if i would have seen the results i wanted from this
did not see any result on my face.
this product did not live up to my expectations
maybe i'm expecting too much from a moisturizer or perhaps i'm too young to see its true effects
so when i apply foundation
i will give it more time
i know that is especially bad for the eye area
so for that reason
i need to return this.
i will probably end up trying to find another eye crème once i'm done with this
i gave it two weeks to see if the irritation gets better
when i returned it the sales associate said "it's too strong for you
the first time i ever purchased this product it felt like it worked miracles
maybe my expectations were higher?
it is so small that i almost thought they accidentally sent me a sample instead of the actual product
i'd return it if i could find a decent replacement
did not help with fine lines.
least effective eye cream i have ever tried.
may be just not for me
not even one of them
not for those of us who already have some
irritated as long as i have it on
thought i'd try this cream for a change
i might try it again in the summer.
i wanted to like this more than i did because i love the fact that korres' products are more natural than a lot of other lines
t seemed better than using nothing at all
had asked for help from one of the sephora employees
i will be returning it
it did not spread well
very disappointed, will be returning
moisturisingcons: weird consistency--should have been in a pump bottle
i would have to reapply
it does not absorb well at all
i needed to apply it to my face 3 times for it to not feel tight
will be returning this product
felt that it was beneficial for most of my face
this product should be pushed!
wanted to give it a chance since 2 ladies were very persistent
wish i could return it but i just moved overseas.
this is probably my least favorite korres product i've tried
i think i would have liked this better if i would not have been using the yogurt night cream as well
i wish it would have worked better for my particular skin type
sometimes it seemed to make my face more red because i have to blend it in so much
had hard time applying it as well.
definitely would not recommend for young
you have to really use some strength while applying it
there was no hope in the tube for me.
i hoped for a little more.
wanted to start using something for these purposes
will most likely not even use the rest
are not healthy for the skin
i can name a lot of other eye creams i have had that worked better
will be trying something new.
i feel like i had to apply additional pressure with my finger vs other face creams i have tried
i need to use a lot of it at once in order to apply it without pulling my skin
even if only a tiny bit is used
will give it more time
actually, too quickly, in my opinion.
i end up using a lot more cream than with others i've tried as a result of this
the main key is to use these products every day to see the difference they can make
if you use just once in a while
i ordered this product on line with never having seen it in person
maybe this is how the product is supposed to be.
i think there are other products that do more for the same price or less
will not use again :(
figured it would travel better
no matter how carefully i have washed my face with it
i will no longer be using this soap
might try another bar though
feels good however did not really firm or lift as promises
i must admit that i haven't been very good in using it morning
while i only have fine lines
for 3 months it seem to make things worse
would help with fine lines
made me look older
it does the job for the day
i expected this product to do as it said it would do: firm
did not see any results for lifting
this is clearly not it
i am certainly not at the age where i need the gravity lift yet
well not so much
everyone i know has been asking me if i've just woken up since using this product
it didn't work out so well because his skin is actually very sensitive
it will just do more harm than good.
like others have said
i feel like it is absolutely no better than the drug store br
prefer it much better
i tried it for a month to see if it was just my skin getting used to it
they became more visible once i applied my make up
this cleaners seemed like a great possibility
i did not read it carefully before purchasing
not sure why it had such great reviews
probably does the same amount of work
feel like wasting money on a product this is the one for you
everyone has different skin it may work for others
they were still visible by the time i got to work
i would guess this product would work on younger skin
quickly so the effect is not very long lasting.
i wouldn't say this eye cream is life changing or a must have
this product did not deliver on what claimed to do- did not reduce fine lines
i expected it to be lighter
not sure it was caused by this
this would work well for you
this product was one that was always recommended to me
bought this hoping it would help with those
my fine lines were still there
not working for my eye issues
maybe for those whose eyes do not have any of these issues
doubt it will work for this
it is also slightly oily so when i am rushed in the morning i do not use this because i dont have time to wait for it to absorb into the skin
despite many other reviews said
this will not be good for you
however not sure if it works as well with dark spots
i found another product by murad that was much better
was hopeful for this one
all seemed to be okay
the product was a waste of money did not work at all
to make a long story short this did not work at all
will not use it any more
i would rather have a pump
he said it was too light weight
he could find better options from the drugstore
it was just not meant to be for me
after putting double how much i would usually put
if you put on anything more than a tiny amount
so i'll give it three stars..
i gave it 3 stars because this is the only product that actually gave me any kind of results
won't be using this again
decided to try other products
this was just my experience it probably works on other skin types
there are different moisturizers on the market that would be much better for my skin
this turned out to be harming me more than helping
s that cost alot less that is exactly similar to this
it could just be my skin
considering you have to use it often to get the full effect
there are other masks that do a better job.
i will continue to use it
i believe their are way better products out there at this price point though
i think these are a little too heavy for my skin
i don't really see any difference in my skin at all after use other than them making me more oily
my skin is exactly the same as before
you know when buying fresh you are getting high quality ingredients
it just seemed to sit there, and not set at all.
i found nothing to like about this product.
i think there are better masks that do more for my skin
every fresh product i've tried so far turned out to be a failure
i will not try any more fresh products
yet i invested in this moisturizer assuming that the "experts" at lancome would have kept this in consideration during the design
this was not it
i decided to continue to use this product to make sure that this was what was making me break out
f you have similar skin this may not be for you
she informed me that a lot of lancomes products cause people to break out because of the fragrances they add in their products
some days i would apply it very often throughout the day
the only reason i'm not giving it 5 stars is because after using it for a week i started to breakout terribly
will be my last
the only problem is this product is too small only 1
this moisturizer has broke me out so badly that i feel there is no hope for me to build a relationship with this moisturizer any longer
it was not the product for me
almost too much so
it may not be bothersome for some
definitely not recommended for those who live in cities where faces are already chapped from the environment
i wish i knew this product is not recommended to use immediately after shaving
even after using it twice it's still very hard to get off
i need something more gentle than this.
might try the other formula
it made me breakout like i never have before.
i didn't find it to be effective at all for me
would always still be there
for those who do
now i have to deal with the after effects
based on the reviews i just knew this is what my dry
i used it for 2 weeks trying different ways
it is not the best product i have ever used.
i will be returning the product.
while this one is a one time deal
this is one of them
what i liked:it's very moisturizingit did reduce eye puffinessthe spf is goodskin did appear to have fewer fine lines
the first time i put it on i thought it was great because it was non oily
the pump would not get any out already
would never get used still
when there is still 1/2 of the product left
i just wished i would have avoided this product all together
everyday that i used it
the easier it is to prevent them when you're older
by the time we got there
it may be a good eye cream for some
i suggest sampling before purchasing because i notice i'm not the only one here who had this experience
the eye cream really did not meet my expectations
even if we lay by the pool
so at least i did not waste money on it
the product may as well work
as much as the product is not meant to get into your eye i have never had this problem from any other under eye cream
there are better eye creams out there that do more
should have known that before purchasing
best product they make
it caused major breakouts that were very difficult to get under control
which i have both of
this product made me break out worse than i have in a very long time
i am having trouble deciding how i feel about this product
so end all be all.
i don't feel as if i'm committed or will accept this as part of my regimen
though thankfully not tight like some reviewers have experienced
i will use it up
i would like it a lot more
this one is not work for me at all
you might easier find another better one than it.
require something a little stronger
i'll be trying out other caudalie products though
you need a little bit more than normal
which means you go through the product quicker
may be suitable for someone who does not wear make up or who has extremely sensitive skin
i even used the clarisonic
it claimed to be great for all skin types
every time i used it it would give me bumps all over my face
i just want to know why was the order processing late ?
it is not likely to work
i got the product having high hopes
maybe the more mild one would be better
thought it would be a great idea to start a completely new skincare routine by using all clinque products
i'll be returning it for something else as it is not appropriate for my needs
it could work for others so its worth a try!
they all seem to leave my face very dry to a point where it hurts to even keep it still
i would use again
i believe i should've bought one of the other ones
i would have to say after trying this product it made my skin worse
still undecided as to whether to try the "very mild" or just try a whole new other product
it's only now that i'm in my 20s that acne has become a part of my life
i could have dealt with that if it would have cleared up my breakouts
i feel as though i could find a better face wash that would be more effective
although the three step system made my face feel wonderful after using it
maybe it was bringing up all the junk that was possibly under my skin or maybe it was just plain
either way i had more acne i had ever had in my life because of this cleanser
it did the exact same thing in less than a week
going into the colder months i wanted to avoid products like that
thought this product would make my skin even better
thinking my face needed to get used to it
my face is already looking so much better
if i hadn't i would have returned it
this product did nothing to keep shine away for longer than 1 hour
could it be that i just have rather large pores?
to be spending that much money on such little product that doesn't do much
not far from it
my make up did not last longer
for $22 hoping this would work out well for me
they aren't too large to begin with
i will be returning it
where i applied this
it might work great for some but not for me.
you know how none of these pore perfected ever work?
you can park a fit car in my pores so maybe i expected the promise they claim to actually be true
still not the best primer out there
i never get the problem with other product
!i will definitely return this time !
i've tried so, so many different brands.
will continue to use it
i only used it once
and they were able to get in touch with them.
now i have bumps in their place
now i am going to try out the new urban decay one
it is nothing like i have sampled in stores or the ones my mom has gotten in the past
so much has been wasted or unintentionally overused because the bottle will not cooperate
so much will come out at once i try to put it back in
while on the hunt for the perfect pore blurring company for my face- i tried out about 6 different products all claiming to the the same thing
this product felt like it put its efforts into feeling more luxurious
hopefully that one will be better
also does not help with makeup lasting so you will still need a primer
or they say primers help make up stay on longer.
well not this one.
i used the same exact make up on both sides of my face
maybe the make up will last longer
would use it every day if it had no tint
even when i just use it without foundation
also the smell will keep me from ever purchasing again
i gave it the 3, but this will be going back!
that did a much better job
better than some i've tried
the smell put me off so much that i've only used it twice
i also think is breaking me out in the areas i put it
that was far from the case
i wish that i hadn't believed her when she said that it would work over time
this bottle looks like it should hold 3-4 times the volume that it does
was horrified to find that it is no longer on the market
so you have to use more to get the job done
so this has been on my list to try for sometime
while i have not had any breakouts since using this product
this might still work for you
perhaps it would go great things for people with other types of skin
i hope this helped.
there is even twice as much product
so does most i used in the past
perhaps some other br
i can see though that it might not be great for heavier make up wearers
i can see why this product would work well for some people
it was way too light
i gave this cleanser two stars because i can see where it might work for some people
thought this would be just as great
this might be great for you
as you would expected
though it may be gentle
wonder if this was the origin
the only reason i gave this two stars is for that reason
didn't help my fine lines as it states...
have not seen any results what so ever
continue to use it in hopes that maybe one day before it's gone i will magically see results
it generally did nothing else to my skin after continuous use
i plan to stop using this one
one way or the other
i don't see any added benefits from using it
can be used on the eye area
before i could determine if it was working i had to return it due to breakouts
unfortunately i had to return this today
not for me at least
may be a good product
may be a good product-
not at all what i expected.
i would not recommend applying it to the eye area
if you like rose in general
you put it on and expect result.
this is just not one of them.
will not continue using it
even with all the positives about it
found i had to use a lot to get any kind of good response on my skin
i didn't have high expectations of it
there are much better serums out there that's cheaper than this
i find it very hard to absorb
i tried a few times, but i could feel it all day.
this particular one did not work well for my skin
figured out using this product was the only change i had made
my face has never produced so much oil before
so try this product out beforeh
it was much much better before i started using it
i wanted to try a newproduct line so with help from the sales consultant
this product would be worth it to me if it worked better
f you are planning on using this for all over blemishes
however i did not see any results after 2 weeks of use
'll probably just continue saving up
while this product has worked for many it did not for me
it was very expensive to have it not work
i wish i had read the other reviews before wasting 100 points
the results were not reflective for us.
if you use this product you can not mix with any other as it cause piling
it does it without other products as well
are by no means gone
however it has not worked well on my skin
which can be tough to deal with
so maybe this would work better on younger skin
it could just be the spf
i can't use it during the day because that combined with my makeup will make me break out
even though i only used it once
unless lancôme have changed the ingredients to it
i took off two stars because i feel like this would work if you have exceptionally dry skin
i could use this on my whole face just perfectly
00-hoping it would work-
really wanted to like this-i figure for the high price it would work not true-i have a sew lines-
know results-so now i stop using it-my eyes are healing-not good for me that is for sure-my search goes on
i repeated the process a third time to make absolutely sure that it was indeed caused by the eye cream
not as well as the seabeery oil
this was good at removing everything else except that
since i don't i will be returning
this was not one of them
i figured it would be the same.
i saw nothing different when using it then any other oil i have used before
i expected more from this product being that i can't say enough great things about the take the day off balm
i suppose it would work well for someone who is wearing very minimal makeup
there are products out there that will work better
a lot more cheaper than this
when i used it
either way was not effective
i will be returning
first of all, i was using this stuff incorrectly.
there are better products out there
now that i've discovered how to use it
will continue to use their products forever
i used this once
the take the day off balm is a much better option
there are too many cons that come with it
this is one of the few clinique products that i do not recommend
i find that i have to pump three times in order to fully get product onto my face
how about got no milk.
would say i have combination skin
all i can say is i felt like my eyes were on fire
in spite of all of this i didn't feel like it removed my make-up at all
i hope not all the sephora employees were instructed to say it is safe to use on the eyes
after two applications my makeup still wasn't even close i being gone
i believe this is more focused of skin clearance of acne then taking off anything else
this is what she recommended
the only down side is that this product doesn't fully remove make up
just wish it removed more make up with less product
that was about it for me
forth fairly vigorously to get anything off
i tried this out after not being able to purchase my usual dual phase oil version of this product
they seem to carry it at some sephoras
the sephora sales person told me this is a "all in one" meaning it could double as cleanser
same problem here as with the others
is more stubborn than i realize
i still felt like there was something on my face that shouldn't be there though
i expected the same kind of results from this
use this for my face
i feel like i have to use a lot to take off all the makeup
i look 5 yes younger just from the eye area alone using it for less than a month
once applied i wasn't happy with the base it left for makeup either
i've never used a product that made me break out this bad
before they decided to change it to this "wrinklereisist" formula
thus can not comment on how well it works
was extremely difficult to get out of the bottle
it would be much better in a pump or jar.
i should have asked for a sample as it would have saved sephora
while i was able to feel a smoother skin as a result of one week of use
at least not in my case
i should know by now
which may be pro's for you
will keep on looking something richer.
i think i look for a more subtantial
as i am not willing to spend $200+ for their high-end line
i actually like it better than the benefiance original
we hoped that this would be the same cream
now benefiance moisturizers are twice or more of what it used to be
t would have lasted me quite a while
decolete when i would rather use something that deals with the wrinkles
would probably be great if you have extremely dry skin
i strongly believe if i continue using this product
this product is not right for someone in their 30's
i will keep looking!
not for the face
don't think i have been using the product long enough to confirm results
it will definitely provide enough moisture one would need
wish i had paid attention to the ingredients before i used this
i think that for $55 there are much better creams out there
ideally that would be a good thing
it also doesn't feel as hydrating as i would expect it to be
its not even that effective when used nightly anyway so both these reasons
it was simply too heavy for me
i might be waiting around forever because i still haven't seen any improvement
what's the use of using a cream that will work for now
hopefully, she will have better luck with it.
i cannot say that this product helps in minimizing wrinkles under my eyes because i just noticed now that it is more prominent than before
in search again for a better one
but it is not suitable for me.
i wish this would have worked for me
have never had an issue with an eye cream being too heavy until i tried this
definitely does not prevent/reduce wrinkles- i have used it for at least two years now
i will check back in the reviews if anyone else has experienced this
super disappointed i've spent all this money on it
at first i thought i was using too much.
i will still use it
the more sensitive of us would do well to avoid this particular formula
hopefully, that changes with longer use.
every time i would apply it
so unfortunately they're being returned.
it just doesnt seem to give a thorough clean
i really didn't get to use the last half of them because they were so dry
it seemed to prevent that a bit
probably will just return it
also, i was just as oily if not more than usual.
overall would not recommend it
even though this is oil-free
i took two stars off because i do not think it is work the price when there are cheaper products out there that do just as well
not as bad as right now
thought this product would
this is still highly recommended as it truly does help with cutting out the shine
those are the only great things i can say
this is one of them
it just never absorbed in no matter how little i used
it controls my t-zone pretty well on a normal day
guess this one might only good for people who has extremely oily skin
i could not believe that my face would produce this much oil
i just wanted to try something new to swap back
i no longer use it.
which would probably be really awesome for a person with normal skin type during the summer months
i remember that the jar is smaller than i thought it was going to be
personally for me it just left more to be desired
this might be good for customers with less oily kin
hoped for the same results
estée lauder in the gold jar has still been the best so far
i've tried so many others hoping to find something less expensive or something that had better results
many reviews said they thought the product would be greasy
this product makes my face break out which hasn't happened to me in many years
for some reason i thought it was an eye cream
as there are other
have never had an issue
for some reason i just felt like this did not absorb well into my skin
only need a little bit
as others mentioned it does work well with a clarisonic
perhaps people with oilier skin would have better results with this product
i will have to return it
not clean deeply which is what i need
there are good products out there that will make your skin brighter
even high-end ones
all the cheap ones i have used have given me the same results
for me it immediately broke me out is small bumps which a lot of products do because i have sensitive skin
each will do their job
not to mention i was trying to use the whole white lucent line in hopes of finding the line
it may be something that is in the entire line or just one of them
t doesn't work as well as the older formula
should have returned it now knowing the return policy
will be exchanging for another product once i have time to
not sure if i will stay with this product in the future those
as i am not sure i am getting the benefits that it claims
i am sticking with it to see if the results will be there at the end of the bottle i do not see a moisture product
i think it should be good for those people staying home a lot
not sure if it will make my skin really brighter in the long run
this one was a no go
this product would be it
i like some of the other shiseido products better
it does not absorb very well.
this one is not the best of them
not good for travel
this product did not absorb too well
you never want to carry this around in your bag cause it weights a ton
although this might not be an issue for people with very dry skin
i hope they will accept it back
dead skin on my face even more obviously that it only happened to me when i used super cheap cream in high school
i feel that this is something that can work on some
perhaps not work on others
that was way too much
there has not been much
did not absorb quickly at all
it not not absorb quickly
kept tolerating it until one day i told myself that i was totally done with it
i concluded that this product is not for me
well in need of something
they are never effective.
i've gotten several of these as bonuses
i'd say that this isn't the best product for someone who already has signs of aging under their eyes
i expected sth more miraculous half way through i stopped using it on everyday basis since it was not the effect i expected
i wish i could at least have gained some moisture from this product
that seemed to work better for me
did not work for my dark circles or bags as it claims it can
i am generous with the amount i use as well yet i still have issues with flakey skin around my eyes
for me it was just a major waste of money
i am one of the unlucky few that did not receive great results from this product
would have been a good value if it worked for me
doubt it will work for this
it is also slightly oily so when i am rushed in the morning i do not use this because i dont have time to wait for it to absorb into the skin
have been trying to fight undereye lines for a while
no results at all
i am interested in trying the philosohy eye cream though
i'll be comparing those two as well
i would still continue to buy this becaause it has helped me a lot
would stongly not recommend as is too expensive for such a mediocre product
i did notice a red spot on my face get less red a lot faster than it ever would have
i simply had to return it
i continued to use it to see if it will help with my acne
so it was not that effective as i wished.
that could be because this was not meant for my skin type
i will probably try another cleanser next time i run out
i expect my face to be clean also
i really had high hopes for the product.
when i first started using this product i thought it was working well
knew all of the reviews on this one were really good
i find i'm using that more
these products made me break out
the results did not last
thought this one has actually worked
that's the only product from this line that i am using
this did not provide enough cleansing action
i am only giving it 2 stars because of the fact that it seems to cause an insurgence of oil production on my face as the day goes on for me
i expect something a bit longer lasting then this
as those ingredients are not beneficial for your skin in any way
it is not "calming" in the least
it will not remove them
i would say that this removed maybe half of the foundation i used
in the week i have been using something else my skin has completely cleared
trying to spread it as best as i could
i could feel it still on my face
i would like to first say that i have super sensitive skin
so i will have to return this product.
my challenge with the product was that it did not feel like it cleaned my skin
this is the first time i have use this
it think it may be a bit too sensitive
it is definitely not the best for make up removal
some may not do the job
should have no worries
told me she never had run into such an issue
maybe i had too high of expectations
can get something similar to this at a drugstore.
i didn't expect it would yield different results
i know it might be great for some people
liked them much better than this eye gel
the execution has more problems than you can shake a stick at
so far best eye product i've come across
perhaps this is a product for someone younger than 50
i am still trying to repair the damage that was done
i should have returned it.
it must be some of the ingredients in there.
i would not use this even as a day cream.
i will be tossing it since sephora would not allow me to return it
this got worse with each use.
i could probably deal with the phenoxyethanol
" or even seriously trying to be
there are cheaper masks that do the same
love the results, although not permanent.
that could just be because of my skin type
i've tried at least 2 dozen mask infer time
they are all invisible just like what the title says however they are visible again after a few hours
the bigger ones are still there ill try it a few more times before i decide if im going to keep it
get something 5 times the size from the drug store that will do the same thing--almost nothing
used for 3 months %26 pretty much did nothing
or if its just made that way
you might be able to find better
this is definitely the worst mask i have ever used
the instructions say to put on liberally which makes the use of the product run out pretty fast
the price is too much for having to use so much to get the results that are intended
some of which i made
i also had the old tube before it changed so my packaging wasn't awful like a lot of the reviews have said
amazing product that i've been using for a long while
you need a lot of it in order to apply to the entire face
why on earth would they change the packaging!!
makes it difficult to get every last drop
get any last remaining product
how can we get the tube packaging back??
i should write some positive ones
because this one is a dousy
i would give this cleanser a million stars if i could
its no longer easy to travel with
or at least give us the option to choose between the bottle or the tube
i would not recommend for every day use starting off
this product might work for others
she said this product would be good.
they'd be happy to keep helping me find a better product for me
i am still on the fence as to if i will keep or return this product
it is definitely not as effective as i assumed it would be due to the price
for $48 i hoped it would've done better.
hope for better or i will leave this one behind
like something i could get at the drug store for much cheaper
this may be a good idea
i say pass there are plenty of other great acne products out there
murad is better to use in the morning when makeup will be going over it
even though it was expensive
i should have returned it
i should have known better
i wanted something that would prevent as well as heal
it also doesn't do well when applied with other products even with other products from this line
this may work to other people but not for me.
the two did not play well together
am trying another product now
i would still break out while using this product
not for me, i expect more from a serum.
my breakout is the same, if not worse.
i've tried their other product 'porefection'
this product did not work well for me at all
it get one star because it is very expensive for the small tube
the worst part was that it didn't help my breakouts at all
useless should have been the name
i tried this serum because i have been having a breakout or two lately
it does not come with the pump in the photo.
reviews are hard to go by
i came on here to see what others had to say.
it seems like some of their formulas have changed
not for the better
after reading all these reviews about great this wash is
i still have small breakouts every now
there were just too many bad chemicals in it for me to like
on the hunt for something that actually works!
i notice some people saying how it helped their acne
i will continue using it
i would return this if i could find the receipt
i can deal with the feeling
i tried it 3 separate times to make sure it was this product
since others seem to like it
i think it requires more time than i expect at this cost
expensive for no results yet.
nothing has come out
see if there is another comparable product because i really dislike the pumpdispenser
this is a nice product none-the-less
i definitely at least expect to be able to see a difference in my skin
i wanted to start preventing any wrinkles that are sure to be coming my way soon
i decided that it was time to start with something more focused on anti-aging
they were great for me
i would only wear natural stuff from now on
i decided that it was time to start with something more focused on anti-aging
they were great for me
i would only wear natural stuff from now on
waiting longer to apply after cleansing
there are probably better products out there for your money -- i've been using this product for almost two months
although the product doesn't seem to last too long
i may have given it more time to adjust
it was apparently too strong for me or i'm allergic to something in it which is common for me
have used it religously am
not even any temporary ones like some of the other girls report
learned the hard way more expensive doesn't mean better product
i'll be going through several other products this year
i feel like this is a totally temporary fix for fine lines around the eyes
did not see much results with this product.
the pump did not work properly.
will be returning this.
it was so expensive i am trying to persevere
when i used this
not only was the smell overwhelming to the point of not being able to ignore it
this was one product she used on me
i am making a good guess that this product is making it more oily
was really hoping this would help keep me matte longer than an hour
perhaps it would be better for the summer weather
it is small enough to travel with
i know there are way more expensive moisturizers out there
this is still rather expensive for me
i expect it to work well
i've decided that it must be the culprit
could be worth a try for others though
this product might be worthwhile for others who are slightly dewy
eventually it was too much
also less oily looking at the end of the day
i would not recommend it for sensitive skin or at least for me some ingredient in it reacted badly with my skin
needed something oil-free
as i have never found any product that could actually do this
my only concern is that sometimes when i apply it
like elsewhere in the reviews
i stick with natural lines as they are better for my skin
this would work well for you
next time i'll try something different!
however can probably find equally effective product for less $
i came to thinking that maybe it'll be be better if i use this while using the gel
thought i would give it a shot either way considering everyone is different
after that my skin getting better
i know it takes a few weeks for a product to actually start working or being able to see a major difference
this soon became too harsh for it
even when i used it without my foreo
initially i thought it was working
not sure if i'm the only one experiencing this.
other than that, i am happy with this product.
i am unsure that this has helped at all
it is supposed to prevent
my face has never in my life been so dry when i used this product
plus i seem to break out more since using this..
i will not be one of those people who say it is a terrible product because everyone's skin is different
i know we are all desperate to find our magical product
was expecting the face wash to be great
this one does last a very long time though!
so maybe my expectations were high
other than that i feel it's just same as others
doesn't work in the least when i'm having a breakout
i gave 2 stars rather than just 1 because it absorbs quickly
the word 'emergency' should probably be taken out
it is possible that this could work better on a different type of acne than what i have
the main reason you would use this product would be to clear up troublesome acne
this is probably one of the least effective items i have used in terms of speediness
perhaps you need to use more on a regular basis?
time again hoping maybe this time it would even minimize a blemish just a little
other spending to get the same stuff
i want to continue using it on breakout spots to clear them
this makes it even worse
also, my make-up goes over it very easily.
this product might be good for long-term skin control
maybe it helps in the long term
just not as much as i'd like it to
sadly this product was not one of them
i am exchanging it today for a different product in hopes the new one will help more
this is odd being that its supposed to help heal.
which is what some people are saying
can't tell if its because of this product or a combination of all the new products i was using
get the same results
they will do more.
it was the only thing new that i was using consistently
it could be because i have extremely sensitive skin
to make it even worse
i would say there has been little to no change at all
i didn't feel like they were fading
i've used other spot corrector's for half the price that have actually worked
i figured it was one of those product that takes effect slowly
t seems to have worked for some
much less for those who have sensitive skin
who have sensitive skin is for sure a no no
if it were not for the inclusion of alchol denat
there are few ingredients as bad as this one.
get new ones still
one of those products that you are not sure if it works
not to an extent that it would be considered a miracle worker
it probably has to be used everyday to get to that point
i feel i had too high of hopes for this product.
just not for the rest
not for more sever ones
i will keep using it to see if they will fade more
it hasnt gotten much better either
in fact most people would probably assume that's what they are
i will continue using to see if its effects increase at all
overall there is not that much product given
i didn't feel like they controlled oil all day long
this has helped to even it out
the rest of my face skin wasn't looking that great either
it seemed like my face did not absorb it at all
i should have returned this
anything that pretty much claims to renew skin
it did not work for me they way the product is described to work
i really had high hopes for this cream
think enough time for it to work
i will never know if it would have lightened my dark spots eventually
dosen't work for me no result at alll .
i would like to wait for some more time
would continue using it for a while
got so-so results
i can handle most products, but not all.
unfortunately this is one of the few that falls under can not
i will go back to using alergenist.
i may as well be putting water on my skin for all the good it's doing
feels better after use than before use
i expect you would need to be using this cream for a longer time in order to be able to see real improvement
just may not be the treatment for me.
it didnt really get my face as clean as i was hoping
just wasnt as effective as i was hoping
have tried almost everything
just to use it up
any time i have ever used any br
not for any other purpose
actually it was getting worse
but not effective for me.
was confident their body wash would not be a let down
if it did work the results are minimal.
would rather buy a regular bar of soap that does the same job
it may work for others, but not for me.
was aware that it might be drying
i need something a little stronger
this soap actually makes me break out more than i was already
i am desperately searching for something to get rid of my breakouts
i never take the time to review products
this product made me breakout in places i've never had issues with
will be returning this product.
did not feel that it cleaned my face very well either
i would keep looking
after i used this product it actually made my skin break out more
i also found that it made me break out in areas i usually do not
this may not work very well for you
very expensive at $32 for no real results.
probably both washes were way too aggressive.
this is not that.
purchased this product after seeing how great the reviews were
i will wait a few more months to see if there are any changes before going with a different br
i never thought face wash would take so long to start working
i probably should have tried for longer
use a lot of stuff from boscia including all there masks
it did nothing for acne used it consistently for 2 weeks
even with the pump it manages to allow you to get all of the product out
this would probably be better for someone who has little to no acne
this however has been keeping them away!
i will probably return it
at least sephoras return policy is amazing.
i need to see results quickly
that with some products your face gets worse before it gets better
those aren't the products for me
so that may be the reason
i will probably look for a new product once i finish this one
more because i'm bored than because there is anything wrong with the bosica treatment
i needed a little more "oompf" from my products
at least it didn't make my face worse
she told me it would be way too harsh on my skin
the only reason i gave it three stars were for 1 reason
everything i have purchased is amazing this is the only disappointment that i have had
it has not worked
is great if you indeed have sensitive skin
they should have just labled it "for sensitive skin" then
there is still a ton of make up
however i love the rest of the line!!
i always felt that there was remaining residue
because it didn't work in either capacity
this is why i have gone to another company for face care
thinking it would help even more
it seems like some other methods i've tried that hasn't really shown a difference
as for being a redness solution i am not seeing much in the way of results at all
somehow managed to still be
not one has fully worked until know
it seems like it helped out a lot of other people however i will not be buying it again
i gave it a whole month to work just hoping it would get better
the old ones were going away much faster
never have issues like this before.
as many others have said
i needed something heavier
this product didn't help at all
that others say it is for them
liked the fact that this was oil-free
if this product worked for me then i would have expected my rosacea to either improve or stay the same
wanted to see if i could soothe it rather than cover the problem with foundation all the time
was hoping this cream will work well for me
using it before putting my make up is completely out of question
i will use the bottle to give it a chance to work
just what they claim
not sure it does more than olay pro x wrinkle which is much less expensive
the main reason i would not buy this again is because there is too much fragrance in this product that can't possibly be good for the skin
i believe i just need to use it longer to see greater results
do intend to continue using it twice a day to give it a fair chance to make an improvement on the wrinkles
i didn't see much difference as when i use other cheaper br
i am not able to rate this product.
i am still giving this product a chance to perform
but not any more.
not how a mask should feel at all
thought this would be just as effective
so confused how this works for other people.
definitely not a must-have for me
off for almost a year with the hope that at some point it will live up the hype
even more sensible to other products after using 3-5 times
maybe it will work for other skin types
will never use again!!!
i put the product on my face to give it a try still
that is one thing that i have not found this product to give me
they are so huge
i tend to breakout a day or two after using it
i really like certain results from this mask
she said this should help
this was the only thing different i used that particular night
so that had to be it
we have to find what works for us individually.
even if i had only received enough for one attempt
i tried using it alone
it became more of a hinderance than a help
9% water so you are are unlikely to reap the full benefits
you are far better off to take it orally
hopefully after a few more weeks i'll see bigger benefits
i'll continue using what i have
for some reason my skin just couldn't get used to/benefit from this product
the effectiveness diminished or i should say disappear after i have used half bottle of it
it will leave my face will lots of white fibres
while the suggested use of this is one
i will continue to use it until its gone.
i will probably do another review in the future.
why it is more beneficial to mix on your own
as far as the results go
i will be returning for sure.
was hoping this cream would really work based on the reviews
went in asking the person working for a good eye cream to help them
where i never had
none of which have ever worked
there where i may have stayed out
this was another fail
was excited thought that they would at least lighten up a tad
this did not improve them in any way shape or form
it might work for some people
i'll give it a little more time though.
safe to say i have giving it a fare chance to work its magic
gave this three stars because it can provoke 'thoughts' in my husb
was having a hard time finding it
i decided to return this product because i would trade dark circles overworsening fine lines
not too worried about fine lines this may be the cream for you
i suspect it might be good for lines
i really was being optimistic with this product.
some reviewers are saying perhaps the good results are from the massaging motion of putting it on
if that were true
will live with it for now
but i hope that it will work for me!
slowly not using it at all
the last month i haven't been using it quite as much so that could be why it seems to be lasting so long
thought i would open the package
it has come to a point where i will just stop using it
it worked for many people
however for me, not so much.
it should have, really.
sometimes not at all
it's definitely in the areas that i have used the product most
you realize your skin has not changed at all in any long term way
i wouldn't purchase again as i need something that changes my skin for longer than a couple of hours
it has a lot of glycerin in it so you would think that it would be a good base
beyond i had a lot of closed comedones while using it regularly
chose to stay with it
for me this's just like any other gel based moisturers i used in the past
i got this because people said it would be good for my super dry skin
accidentally ordered this since they looks very alike
i will never use this product again.
i would not recommend for people with sensitive skin
i did find that i had more breakouts while using which was problem number one
in order to have enough coverage for your face you would need a lot of product
i wanted a higher end
i no longer use it on days i use base of any kind
that might be a better option if you want to avoid layering with this product
i think there are better options that are most cost effective for the amount of product you get with a better scent
does not fade away for quite some time after application
i couldn't return this product because i'm away in a small city for college
the sephora was rather far
every time i use it
did not spread well
add this note just so people are aware of the ingredients
i am not willing to continue in hope of long term benefits
if you apply it more heavily it does this worse.
i must have been allergic to something in it.
considering that this is only second time in my life that i felt this way in response to a moisturizer
there are way better ones out there.
there are other products out there that work just as well
maybe my hopes were too high
but it did sting every time i applied it.
based upon the reviews i was really hopeful it would work for me
did not work well with other skin care products
if anything it makes my fine lines more prominent
'd think that a product with similar active ingredients
i hope others have a better experience.
as far as making my face feel good i must say it was soothing
i must be the 1 in a billion people that is not very impressed with this product
i like using this in the summer or occasionally
make it go bad very quickly
the next day my face will feel sensitive
had expected this product to be good
i'll have 2 return it regardless of whether it works or not
they said they get this a lot because there is something in this cleanser that turns
then this product will probably work
there are far better cleansers out there.
will be returning it as it cost too much to just sit under the sink
it was recommended by many people
that the company says "no one else has"
you can do just as good with half the cost.
am accustomed to people asking me if i'm tired all too often
i've come to realize i just have thin skin/bad genes as the problem does not go away with increased rest
that i still have
what i got was more of the same
50+ women are out of luck if they depend on this therapy
my first time spending money on anything like this product
i will only try other products with a money back garuantee
i am going to try to exchange it for something less invasive
did not deliver what was advertised
i don't need the anti-aging protection because looking at my relatives
this one did not live up to my expectations
however they recommend weeks of use for full effect
however often too much product comes out with each pump
to me this product is not at all useful.
not sure which ingredient was the problem as i have not had this happen before with eye cream
so far i've been disappointed
have yet to see any differnece.
its just too early to say if this product is good
i hope it is because of the perricone.
i previously was given a sample of two products that helped my eyes gain their youth back
it seems to not work as drastically as the previous 2 products
have not gotten any results
probably would have given this product a full bottle o fusage to see results if i had been happy with the other perricone product
they were going to return my call
so my lack of results is not to say this is a poor product
there are others out there that are lighter
things are only getting worse
when i used it my skin felt like it had been cleaned however like i still might have oil
it may work for others
you are better off without it
not for me since
i expected this to be amazing from the first use
i really doubt about how clean your face would be by using this
i think this product is best for people who have normal skin
with so many great reviews i decided to try this product
this may indeed be a great product
most importantly make-up at the end of the day
will probably use the rest of the product
too expensive for what they claim.
i discontinued using it several times to see if it was a freak reaction
this product was even more so
i will no longer use it
hopefully will be able to return it
thought the price for it was a bit over the top as well
i would have been able to accept that if there were any firmimg benefits
i do believe it is helping to prevent further damage/aging
since it didn't perform well i had to return
too expensive to keep otherwise
i wanted to try perricone products for a long time
there are much better products out there.
so far i am not seeing super results from the product
that could be because most of the serum goes on the floor
that i still use
she said it would be really gentle
i needed more than one pump to get the lather i needed
than this is the product for you
there are so much better
so use a good moisturiser afterwards
no one ever answers
about 1/3 of the lists say this stuff has almond oil while other sources say it does not
there are actually many other differences in the ingredients
or are you just changing up formulas for whatever is more cost effective?
it is very gentle- in some ways i didn't think that it was strong enough to fight
this probably works well for most people.
just need 1 pump on average; at the most 2.
've decided to stop using it
but they also haven't gotten any worse.
i can see how others might find it offensive
obviously for many people it is not an issue
she used a lot, like a mega helping of it.
i would think it would work better on people with oily skin
not effective at all though.
i also bought it because there aren't many unwanted chemicals in this br
i didn't like the fact that a lot of product dispensed with each pump
i needed to use way too much of this product to cover my whole face
is less dry yet thismoisturizer still isnt doing the trick
i will not go for this specific product again
the air dispense did not work at all
i think this would be good for someone with a more normal to combination skin
it made my breakouts worse after using it for 3 weeks as advised by the sephora staff so they happily let me exchange it for something different
i usually can find atleast one thing positive about all skin products
if you are on the fence
a $45 "day" cream that claims to protect your skin should have better game
the first time i use it it felt great on my face
i think i'll try it in the winter season as well
i would not consider it sensitive
i would recommend trying it out before completely crossing it off your to buy list
it also didn't absorb well at all
even though they claim it to be suitable for all skin types i personally think it would be better on dry skin
not strong at all
i would use it everyday
i'd prefer something i could use both day
my number one reason for only giving this 3 stars is the scent
to try the benefits i used some of it
did not absorb well
which is what kept me from using it as soon as i got it
not the best for me but better.
knew it must be this
i only got this because i thought the clearcalm serum was only meant to be used at night
i needed something to help with oil
after receiving the clearcalm gel cream i noticed that it says it can be used day
can at least say that this product did not dry my skin out
maybe some balancing effect if at all
it works for most of the day
these products made me break out
thought this might help it some
i can tell it's working because my face has been glowing- however
does not absorb in at all
i think i went through the product fairly quickly
there aren't lasting results on that
let me start by saying that i may have applied too much of this cream
that may be why i disliked it so much
this one is a no for me
perhaps i used to much at time of application.
i just assumed that it would be fit for all skin types
for this price i should have just gone out
the only reason i am still continuing to use the product is because it was expensive
i feel there are better moisturizers out there for a better price
other than those entirely off-putting things
i might consider using it as a night cream
would absolutely never use during the day
i understood the amount i would be getting upon ordering
it seems too heavy for me to use in the day
adding if you need more
it does seem to absorb somewhat quickly
'm sure the jar would last quite a while
hoping to see more progress with this one
i would be very upset if i had spent the money on this
besides being so expensive
i would like to add that this product was very sticky
it might be good for some people
i find the line to be really expensive for what you get though
it did not live up to expectations
it seems that no one has this issue.
i wish they made this in a smaller size because it's so wonderful
for the $90 price tag i have way to many masks that work sufficiently enough
i could live without it
you would expect a lot more from it
there are a lot more better products in this price range
i hope others like this product.
that i just had to experience it
if it were less expensive it might be worth it just for the relaxing scent
there are better products available at other places
it is one of the best masks i've ever tried.
i guess this is more for those naturally good skin?
i will finish up what i have
the only positive is that it didn't make my skin feel tight no matter how many times i went back in
i will be returning.
will not use it
then this product may not be for you
i recommend this only to people with very acne-prone yet not prone to sensitivity- if i've ever heard of such a thing-no way
i just wanted to warn others whose skin is like mine
i'll use the rest of it
at least it was very clear
not so well on the eye make up when using primer
this is absolutely the worst face wash i have ever used
like mentioned by some
not even the best moisturiser is able to help
plus it left so much makeup on my face that it was not worth using ever again
although there are many things i loved about this cleanser
have been able to keep it calm for a while
if the acne continues i will have to switch to another br
which one might think is what the "residue" is
tried using it multiple times just to be sure this was the culprit
without fail i would wake up with breakouts
not near as good
is that i can remove my make-up with it
i wish they would add the fragrance back.
they did not cost as much as this product
hoping that they would have it in the sephora store
it seemed as though it was a similar product
this is gloppier than i would like
i would have given it two stars
it is not as good as the product it replaced
i wish lancome would go back to the original formula
it said it was good for both skin types
the packaging could be a lot better
a pump would make it much easier to apply.
there are also much cheaper
that work exactly the same
i don't see what makes it better than any other argan oil that costs like half the price
i used this oil alone for 2 days my skin feels dry then thinking that my skin need to be used to it then i tried it again for a week or so
i believe it made my skin worse because i have been breaking out like crazy
was recommended by one of the employees to use this because when you have dehydrated skin
then i did some research.
we are in the middle of winter
i went in again to either return the product or find a better moisturizer hoping that was the problem
she said "there was no way it could make me feel more dry
it is far too expensive to not make any difference at all
hopefully i get a different lady when i go in because i am clearly not the only person who has this same issue
i'd have taken it back if i could find the reciept
mizon's is 11 dollars compared to 60-whatever that this one was
i'd suggest you not even get near it in the store
because if this had been better
i will keep trying for another week or so
to help make it better
when i used a little more product
i did find/get any long term results
maybe the concentration needs to be even higher or the way in which it is delivered to the skin needs to be changed
every skin will react differently to different products
perhaps the other 25% of "stuff" in this bottle is worth so much?
for $65 i really expected more.
also, one pump isn't enough, and two is too much.
i could try make it last longer by using less
wanted to give it time to work
too expensive for no results i would not recommend this
i am not sure why since it has such good ingredients
will definitely return this product.
you lost a loyal customer who has been disappointed too many times by formula changes
i am so upset that clinique decided to change the formula of a moisturizer that i've been using for around 10 years
as this is most definitely not the same product i have purchased over
i will be starting my search all over again for that "just right" moisturizer
would not be without it
will be finding another product.
i also noticed that as soon as i put it on
that you could see it on parts of my face
this may work for others
i'll keep out on a look out for something better
i've used others that i found to be more effective
have used every one of the super defense creams with no problems
have used both the very dry
until they changed the formula
i really hope they discontinue this
i also just tried the olay rejuvenist moisturizer since i have heard so many great things about that
so when you add all that up
have been using them always
i've tried this product once it came out since it seemed a very well-designed product
will never touch this one again
has no issues within them
recommend you do a test in a small area on your face prior to using on entire face
i did give it a chance for a week hoping that the acne situation will subside
i sadly had to stop using it.
got rid of one of their levels
i wish clinique would bring back their old formula
though it does at least absorb quickly
i'd rather it not be there from the start
switch them up twice a year depending on how they work
i could never put this on
i do like having that option
not sure if i should return again or find a new product
so there is no way to mask that
having worked for clinique- they are a great company
they changed the formula on this product- loved it before
i already have suncreen protection in my make-up
i wonder whether the ingredient list is incorrect because based on that it should have a nice smell
i feel i should be compensated to have endured this product
that could also be due to stress
even we use is as h
i figure they're on the skin for too short a time to do any good
can use it only once a day
i've liked other jurlique products in the past
not really rose like either
have used a variety of products before without every having my face break out
more recently been using it religiously hoping to rid my under-eye horridness
will probably try another product
better than some that i've used
need to use a mattifier every single day
i still tried it
for the price i had hoped this would be much better
i wanted to try new products
had acnes before do not buy this product
trust me i tried this out fora few a good months with different foundations
there depending on what other products i use
i usually only have one that will pop up in odd places
unfortunately that is not the case
i originally wanted a moisturizer that would be mattifying so that i could pair it with a really good foundation
i gave it so many chances
for people who are more oily or acne prone than i am this could work
with my skin being what it is i just could not continue to use this
it takes longer to get rid of it
i've never been so disappointed by a product
'll continue to use it
i didn't see any change/relief as far as oil control
so make sure to test it before using it
paper which is weird because that never happened before
its hard to spread on your face it seems like it stays on the same exact spot you apply it on
will use it up.
typically they work out great for me
i didn't find that it helped with oil control
did not help at all with breakout
this did help with controlling the oil
i think it would be better if this was at least spf 30
thought this would be great because it claims to mattify
it is not for everyday use
after reading so many reviews i thought to give this a try
i don't even think this is suitable enough for normal or combination skin types
i read other reviewers saying they use this with their clarisonic
i never used to have this problem.
this could or could not have been from the product since it was only a small time of use
the only pro i can say about this product is the how much it foamed up when used with my clarisonic
since i have sensitive skin this one is still a pretty good pick
all they had was the kit
they seem to have changed the formula
may be i'm using too each time
it also had too much fragarence.
i believe it would be best for someone with normal to combination skin
i will say that it is a heavier cream that is best applied at night
you could presumably wear it during the day
not sure if this is worth the price though -- i've used plenty of other products that do a better job brightening
not as good as i was expecting
few as they may be
no help at all for my mature face.
maybe it works with a different skin type or maybe people are just overly optimistic because it smells good
i tried them all except this one which was surprisingly disappointing
i think it'd work on a more mature skin
had to be careful with how much i put on
i will keep using
bottom line: you can get better results without any side effects using the renergie lift
i figured i'd continue use seeing as i already had it
i can honestly say i tried to overcome the hardships of this eye cream
i think the day cream does a better job at reducing fine lines too
maybe i just expect more from a night cream
i actually started using this product because i also use the day cream
thought the two together may be mightier than alone
i used it long enough to be sure
even brought out some tiny ones i didn't know i had
hope that one is better for my skin
i am sure it works on other people
i wanted to try it because i have developed bags
also it did not absorb well .
nothing really make me stay with both jars once the product has run out
which did a better job
it hasn't done anything other than create more bags under the eye
still need to give it a little more time
especially since it cost so much
no matter how carefully i pump this
'm going to return it as i'm unable to use it
plus i feel that my fingertips are getting as much of the product benefit as my crows feet
i am sure this works for some
i never thought i had sensitive skin before
will be going back.
for $95 i needed to feel better about my purchase
you do see some positive results
would not mix together well
many others of this line all the time
this product seemed to work
it was very pricey and and did not work.
this is the first one that i could see immediate results
i feel like at least i'm preventing lines the best way i can
however these results are temporary at best- when i applied my liner
especially for the small amount you get
so far not that impressed with the product going to give it a little more time
i used it for 2 weeks hoping things would get worse before they got better
they only got worse
explained that the original one may have come from a bad batch
haven't used it long enough to rate it.
was not happy with either
never trust and try this brand again.
don't think it is really as effective as other products that i've used
i can only tolerate using this 2-3 times a week.
how long is temporary?i will give it a month
hope for the best
i may have to give this product more time in order to see results
i think it may not be the product i was hoping would get rid of my wrinkle area around my mouth
my thoughts are that the product is working
even though i followed the instructions of applying a small amount every other day
i would say it would not be recommended for sensitive skin
i rarely write negative reviews as everyone has different needs
i am very sure that this product is suitable for someone with a different skin type
used it all so no need to return
i will use up the jar i have
said it would go well with the ptr
would not pay almost 70$ for this though.
i tired to use it for a little longer hoping it would get better
do not recommend this for skin above 35.
this was not one of them
i do want to point out that this is one of the favorite moisturizers of one of the women at the party
more dry than it did before using it
it was recommended that i try this since i have combination skin
i figured my skin was just getting used to a new product
will be going back to
once i figured it was this product
sephora should have never allowed this to packaged with the clarisonic considering the brush that is included is for sensitive skin
i used it for a couple days to see if things would improve
required a huge does of moistuirizer afterwards
i am giving it two stars only because i believe that its probably a great product for someone else
this can be for all skin types
truly i think this should be for normal to sensitive skin
that being said it was no better than many less expensive br
so not sure why that was i was also using the exfloikate
so overall its probably not a bad product
not for those who already have dry skin
be careful with this if you have sensitive skin.
i even tried it twice to make sure that it was the cleanser
for the price i expected some sort of result.
that one was much better
the packaging can also be challenging as you need to keep the bottle upside down to not lose the product
while this did help clear them up
so far i like that better
other than that nothing major to show for it
there isn't a lot of product to begin with
i still feel like this will only last me a month
after using this stuff for about two weeks i felt like there was a lot of build up on my skin because it just wasn't getting my skin clean
i do find though the one good thing with this product is that my skin is less oily than it usually is
this product definitely last longer than any other cleanser did for me
the whole reason for buying this was that i wanted something to help keep my acne-prone skin clear
this product actually seems to be making it worse
this product did not help out in making them go away
was trying to find something on the more expensive side thinking it might work better than something off the shelf at the drug store
i get so many of them
so perhaps this product is indeed better for those who have oily skin
i expected it to do a little bit more
this product may indeed be better suited for you
help my skin not suffer so much
wanted some think light
i think it could be a little heavier
i used it all.
the saleswoman said this should only be used by people who are extremely oily or who have bad acne
not sure who would find this product useful.
wanted to try it since my face has been giving me problems lately
t's very likely that i just got a bad one
using only one pump was not enough
i didnt' care for the thing you had to press to release the product
i will keep using it to see if it gets better
i think you could find better or equal quality from a drugstore product
that would do its job
this could be a good spot treatment
i suggest using once a day
gradually use more if need be
i decided to try something higher end to try to take care of my skin as i get older
was hoping this would help control it a little or help clear it up
i would say it would maybe be more effective on someone without skin that is very dry
take a long time to absorb
even though it's much more expensive than any other moisturizer i've used
it never absorbed very well
this product had a lot of promise
it did the same both times
no getting around it
which would be fine if the product was amazing
initially thought this moisturizer would work well for the mild winters we have here in the bay area
sensitive skin would benefit from this more than me
i will likely be returning it to hopefully find something else
if this was put in another set next winter as a full size i would probably pick it up- just not on its own
however it doesn't get absorbed by my skin at all no matter the area where i apply it
there might be an ingredient or two that my skin didn't agree with
absorbs fine as far as i can tell
after reading the ingredients list there probably is not a lot of goat milk in there anyways
will be exchanging for something else.
its also very difficult to assess how much is left in the container
so frustrated that you ruined a product that worked perfectly previously
i tried this as a sample thinking this would be a great addition to my skin care routine for summer since the sephora rep recommended it as being lightweight
however it was not what i had hoped for
i cannot believe they changed the formula
they added so many new chemicals
now have no idea what to use
my foundation didn't apply well over it
not sure if it was from this product specifically
will have to return it
when i used it
this was not the right product for my skin
may be for another skin type
i'll need to attach several times in one day.
used this only once
it also had a cooling sensation which i probably would appreciate more during the summer
i've had better luck with products that are a third of the cost
same thing each time
i think i might have had too high of an expectation based upon other reviews that i read when buying this product
so perhaps the "final review" will be a bit more positive
i continue to learn over
i can get the same thing from a product half the price
so you're going to run out of it much faster then you should if an appropriate amount was dispensed
i didn't find it to be that effective
they did not heal for days
i think there are better products on the market.
even the "temporary results" mentioned in other reviews didn't work for me
i can see it lasting me 6 months
this did not live up to my expectations at all.
this product simply was not all that good
while the associate at sephora was helpful with this product she told me you had to try it for at least a month
therefore i will be rewriting this review when/if i see changes in my under eye lines
i do not see any improvement after using most of the container
they look good after use
i will probably use a less expensive product that works just as well
i know cones aren't an issue for most people
just not as good as others i've tried
i quickly figured out that it was the problem
i think it would be great for someone with less sensitive skin
there would be no way that makeup would apply over this stuff in my opinion
we need to know more about this one before purchasing
t could be worse
when i used it
then this product may work for you
this product seemed to be very helpful when i used it as a sample
this may work well for other skin types
was hoping that this serum would help
for $65 i have liked other products much more
my work requires me to be in the sun most of the day
one small pump was seriously all i needed to cover my entire face
not for me, i had to return it.
sadly this is not one of them.
i tried using very little
i think for the price point there are better
so i had to return it.
it may have been a combination of the summer sun
regardless of what my skin concerns were
i most likely will be switching to another br
think something half the price will work just as well
unfortunately, this was not the case.
i hope they would consider changing the dispenser to one that can be poured out instead of squirt out in the future
looks like others had this problem...
thought i would give it a try he claimed it would take off makeup
there are a lot of better options for a lot cheaper out there
i used a lot of this product
as others have mentioned, there is a heavy scent.
the fact that we recently moved
there are other products on the market that do that
i will first say that this product was very good at taking off all my makeup
they are not harsh
it's going to be hard to return it by mail
you like their other products
no way would i ever pay $100 for this.
guess they felt like they had to something unique given the price
i even had my husb
i used it everyday to get the full affect
this could be a good product as good as it felt on my face
i can promise you this will never make its way into my daily regimen as long as it has that stench
both times could not wait to get it off my face due to the highly concentrated perfume smell that did not diminish over time
regardless of what it might have done for my skin i would not recommend it due to the strong not pleasant smell
was rather surprised with this product being oil free
after using it for a long time it unfortunately didn't improve either
with my skin type, it just wasn't meant to be.
it didn't replenish my skin as well as i would have hoped
i feel like i might as well pay the extra money
however, i could not get beyond the fragrance.
she mentioned the pricey tag on this isnt too bad considering it would last me about 5 months
not sure why since acne girls like me should be using oil-free
this product, however, is only okay.
would give it 5 stars
will definitely be returning.
i will continue to use it
this is my only problem with this product
i would say that the murad age spot
do a much better job than what this product claims to do
it does sting a little at first couple of applications as well as on my new acne
i will continue to use
i will be in the minority.
still didnt see any results
i did experience a few more break outs than normal
it was not a match for my skin type
separate from my skin the way that it did when i used this serum
it might work for some
i wanted to be able to use this product so bad because of the claims it makes
the results were not anywhere near impressive enough that i would consider spending $89 for a 1 oz
for some reason this just didn't deliver
may be good for you skin
i did not see an improvement in 4 days like others have said
i will keep trying it just in case.
no results except for not being able to move my face
because it would be absolutely no difference
tight which is if i use it after a while
this one is not one of them!
found it to be an okay product
found this to be no different than any other drug store clay mask ive used before
the bottle is so tiny im sure it would only take a few uses to use it up
very few products give me problems
rather bring them to the surface where they stay
the results i've gotten have not compensated for that
although i've used it probably only about 5 times
although i'll admit i applied it probably thicker than i should have/needed to
i just think it takes several applications
regular use to really see results
will stick with it
work much better than this
did it again only to have the same results
tends to cause more damage than anything
a product that can shrink them sounded too good to be true
i only used this for about 2
there are plenty of other products that work much better
thankfully i could return it because this would have been a total waste of alot of money for me otherwise
i find that much more effective
the only reason i gave it three stars is because it would leave my skin nice
i think i have more closed comedones after i used it
t would bring back the old formula
after i take it off i can extract them easily
maybe my expectations were too high
that was not the case
i think it helped minimize the look of them a bit
if you need real help for congested skin
i returned it because for $45 i could use something more effective for my skin type
:/ this is so expensive that i had to return it.
you have to use this religiously for this product to work
to give it a good week or 2
using it often to try it out
i am not willing to have my pores look the way they did in hopes that eventually this product would work
after using it for a month i only see that my face appears more supple
was hoping it would perform well
i got this because i really wanted to focus on my eyes before they got any "older
this is such an expensive product for that to have happened
i will still keep using to see if they lighten
i continue to use it
am kind of hoping that it will help prevent also?
so maybe that is why i still have the dark circles
maybe once i get some sleep i'll be able to notice better results
no matter how careful i am it just splurts product all over the place
the pump should really be better quality
it long enough to find out
i hear glycolics are really effective
hopefully more effective than this product
this hasn't happened with any other perricone products i use
if possible i would suggest trying to obtain a sample before committing to the full size
you would think that if the sample that is the regular face lift is good that the higher potency would be better
i will be returning this product
even if i would've looked 10 years younger it would not be worth that smell for me
other people seemed not to be bothered
hoped i'd get used to it
the results are nice
i think if the results were mind-blowing i could get over it
the sephora store told me this would be a great product for the few breakouts i had around my mouth area
i should have returned this product
was hoping to see results over time
if i use it more often than that
i will have to say that a sample is not enough to give a complete review
they mentioned that it has fish oil in it
which apparently is in alot of their other products
perhaps this would work better if.
needed something that would take care of them without leaving a scar
i recently added this mask into the mix because i was not seeing the results i wanted
maybe would be better in the summer
it seemed like i would break out more after using this product
t is still a good product mostly depending on which skin type you have
it simply isn't possible to continue using this product
which you can find in other products for much less
i look like a teenarger at puberty if i use this for a whole week
which normally i would like
i expected much more
i will assume the cream is either too heavy
will be returning product for sure!
although this felt really good on my skin initially
at least i get the benefits somewhere!
i'll give it one more try
i never have skin sensitivity so this is very different for me
so far i've only used it twice
the only reason why i chose 3 stars instead of 5 is because the smell is slightly overpowering
with that being said
where i usually tend to break out
i couldn't even use this more than once to see if it gave any noticeable results because the extremely strong perfume smell was too offputting
this seems to be more directed towards older women
this is the first caudalie product i have tried.
this will not be the first product i've had to return to a store because of the scent
wil be returning this
if i want a scent i'll apply it separately
i would expect a better
i used it once
i truly believed everyone was being dramatic
there are better ones for this price
figure if it works well
how something could be so expensive
i i've tried better products for less than this
there are so many other great moisturizers out there for 30% of what this costs
go in to a sephora if possible
there is no way this is going on my face.
i would think that something that cost so much would at least have a better smell
the only reason i am giving it 1 star is because i have to
no benefit at all.
won't be using it again to see result
this is the first product that i've ever used that the smell was the#1 factor in my not wanting to ever reapply or use
i wonder if there are quality control issues with this product
i will be returning this product.
there are definitely better ones
i didn't notice results any better than other high-end serums i have used
i really wanted to give this a higher rating since my skin looks
there are lots of other great products in this line
i will be staying away from this one
i know this would have provided what i needed for my skincare needs
even with all the good in it
i actually looked up the ingredients to see if there was some sort of meat by-product in it
as i began applying i understood what everyone was talking about
since this product is meant to be used on the face
if it could be smell better i will give it 4 star
got sample of both to help make my decision
not sure if i want to spend the money on a full size which would be needed to determine if there is any improvement to my skin :/
as others have noted
i would've gladly continued using this speedy product if it had produced any results for me
making me a little both blotchier
this was not the case with this one
this will be returned for me.
i will not be re-purchasing the even better kind
i like the even better serum a lot more
not the results that i had hoped for
i got this thinking it would double the product for the buck as it is less expensive then the "serum'
i would recommend it for this who have dark spots
i did by this product before
it seemed to absorb well
i keep using it in hopes my skin will adjust
've been trying a few different products to help correct it
is there really an over the counter or any cream that really does that?
thought the 2 products together would be amazeing
after using this product more than a year i did see any different
t's not even like this product helped with moisturiibg or smoothing
like others have said
i felt like my eyes stayed just as hydrated as it would with with any other drugstore product that i would pay half the price
glad i tried this as a sample rather than splurging for it
if you are a lancome fan you are far better off buying the rénergie lift multi-action eye
i used it all the way to the last drop
it was too far gone
too much money for zero results.
suggest reading before buying products in future so you know what your putting on your skin prior to purchase
not the best from lancome..
i expected a lot from this product seeing that it costs arm
other that i have nothing good to say about this product
my fine lines are still there
when i have it on
i will say my eyes look generally good
hope to see some change then
i did not like this product after using this product for a couple of times my eyes became very irritated
that is about it
also pricey but it worked better for me.
i've gone some time without using it
will try it again in the fall/winter when my skin is more balanced
to each their own though.
the fact that they are cruelty free
i would use it day
we also live in the midwest
i found it to be true
definitely better products out there with better long term skin benefits
that is they are growing
unfortunately, this was one of them.
i suggest not putting money towards this when there are better options for the same price
i'll probably try another eye product next time.
told me that i had to keep up with using it everyday
so that is not an issue i can address
i wish i could give this a negative one million star
i will continue to use it
i will also try some of their other products as well
i really was only able to use it twice
no more for me!
unfortunately there were none of the promised effects
when i used this i felt like i was applying a clear liquid to my under eye area that i had no idea if it was working or not
i want it to help me improve the situation
not just be a temporary relief
i would suggest trying the other eye product from first aid beauty
that one seems to have better reviews
at the time i didn't consider it being because of my new eye treatment
i'd say he looks the same in the eye area
we most likely will try something else if it doesn't show results this third week
i did not have the same results
i used it once
many of the reviews here say that this product works great for under eye bags
dry that any positive results it may or may not cause go unnoticed
not at all the product i thought it would be
i did read the other reviews before buying which were not favorable
not sure if i'd reorder or continue my search for the perfect product
it also does not absorb quickly at all
i think it could be useful to some
this dried out the skin around my eyes even more than they were- so frankly couldn't tell if it helped circles as all i could see was dry
maybe i'd be better off using vitamin e or something natural than paying $30 for this
i will use the rest of this product for the rest of my body
hopefully my skin will return to normal soon.
actually bought this as a set because it was in one of those holiday packs
it may work for someone with less sensitive skin.
i wish this would have held up to what it claims
not as good as i was hoping for
so when i have a breakout
starting to get more dry as i've gotten older
which i'm still using to this day- a definite plus because of how long-lasting it is
my skin felt no different than it does after using a st
not a lot of results i took a better look at the packaging
this i have to return
i'll be returning if i can.
the reviews i read for this product were kind of all of the place
maybe it takes more than a week to see results?
i will continue to use
so far it hasn't helped much
not horribly as i have other products do
it would be going back
i will say though
at the very least
will be returning it.
have no idea how the product itself works because the smell really turned me off from ever trying it again
no other would help
she clearly hadn't actually used it.
both failed, but this one just made me sad.
it will be the last
not too much money wasted
even if i only use a little bit
this product does last a long time because i returned it with a lot of product in it
could try the product without committing
they still look a little red even after using this product
i wish all skin are products came with this option
i returned this even though i was just hoping it would eventually work
it would become more red throughout the day even if i did not have any makeup on
it doesn't have long lasting effects like i was hoping for
just don't expect long term results
if the results were great i might be able to endure the stink
i think this product would be best for people who suffer from overall general redness
i truly hoped this would help my continual attempts to help address most issues
it does help somewhat
i'll use it until it is gone
i will continue to use it
perhaps it is just my skin reacting to something in the product
i expected a lot more
which after using it for awhile it has not done
in fact it has become more dry as well.
very disappointed in this product as i had high hopes
the price is too much for not doing any more than it did
i am new to retinol so maybe i just need more adjustment time
the fine lines are still the same
decided to take the chance on this product for my own
maybe i've expected too much after seeing all good reviews
so far haven't seen much of a difference probably need more time
will give it more time
i figured i'd give it a try due to the rave reviews on this site
especially because it's probably the most i've spent on a skin product
but the product is hard to use.
even tried using every other day
it also would cause my skin
i am almost done with this one
which is why it gets two ☆s
much quicker than i feel it should for a lotion of this price
by the time i would get to work
they would still water
i will be returning it
it did look good later
it also made my makeup look 'orangy' which was the thing that made me return it
did not get the results i was hoping for
same as others i have tried
i will be returning the produce
evaluating if other products may do the job as well without the cost
on which i never usually have a problem
was hopeful that maybe this product would work
even though others have told me for years i won't have as many wrinkles
love him no less after using this product
i assumed i would be getting 3 amazing benefits in one product
it did nothing to reduce oil production instead i think it added shine
i will be returning this product
after reading the reviews i can see that i was not the only one who had the same issue with this product
thank goodness for sephora's liberal return policy as this would otherwise have been a very expensive mistake
it most certainly does not work at all.
i used it for about 1 year giving it an honest go
does not absorb well at all.
much smaller than i thought
i know this is for more mature skin
for me there are other moisturizers that do just as good a job or better
for a lot less money
it was not what i expected at all.
i should have tried it first
i will use it sparingly since i spent so much money for it
heavy feel to it would not even appeal to me in the midst of january
let me say once again that sephora is to be praised
it has helped me discover some wonderful products i'd never have tried otherwise
nothing more than that
i felt it didn't deliver anything more than products costing considerably less
i am a huge fan of trying new products that can be added to my routine
even temporary after using this consistently like i have with other products
i'd rather it have absolutely no scent than this one
i need something heavier than hope in a jar
my face is so dry with this that i am going to return
i will be returning this.
tatcha by far has been the best
cannot say this cleanser will successfully get that off
i should have read the product more clearly before buying
as soon as i stopped using this product
he told me it would be perfect with it.
after reading so many great reviews about this i couldn't help
i definietly do have problematic skin at times
i'll be returning this unfortunately.
i would give it more stars if it were easier on the eyes
i will say though
then this probably would too
unfortunately, this is going to be returned.
i used it one time
wish it would have worked
thought i would be fine
hoping that this will be the magic combination!
perhaps this would work better on someone with much more sensitive skin than mine
i decided to try this because of the anti aging properties it says it has
i also did not like how the product did not spread well over my face with my clarisonic
i will be returning this product!
we are all different
kind of disappointed, expected more from murad.
overall, i would say this is a "fair" product.
most important- they do not test on animals
after reading the reviews i thought maybe i could find something less costly that would work
i could see it was not working
wanted something aggressive for lines
i am somewhat satisfied with the results so far
there is no "quick fix" with this product
you would have to use a bottle of this product to see the full potential of this product
if i am not satisfied with the first bottle
will use the rest
just have no idea what to use first
had to return and was so sad to do so!
i just felt that for the price it should have had more pro's than cons
not harsh at all
thought it would be perfect
will be returning this product
it may be from this or stress
it will suit my needs i'm just not excited about using this 2 pumps is what i use so this 2oz will last me until i decide what i will get next because this br
my face is already getting better
i would just be careful
i would be concerned about false advertising if it hadn't
it did give me a great experience because of its fast absorb rate
i will be returning this product
i would get the same result
we both tried it.
was really hoping this one would work
the one that i used before from some other br
when i apply a lot
the serum might just as well have been water
it doesnt come out as even
i will be returning.
like it so much more
that was about it
not powerful enough for the rest of us though.
there are better products out there if you just look around
however i think i expected this to work miracles
i will continue to use it to see the progress
i still expected a little more from this product
other than that i have nothing to say
have been crying a lot more
so with that said
i will continue using
not for any particular reason other than its easy to apply
they certainly do not refresh more than a splash of water would
just hope to get better results
instructions several times to try to figure out if i was missing something
i feel like i have to buy because i have a habit of putting it on every morning
maybe i don't have the right skin for it to be most effective?
might be just that i need a stronger solution.
i wish it had an spf in it!
is about all it will tolerate
it takes me more than two pumps
this may work for people with lots of fine lines?
did not have good results
i must be fair
for those who are in the same boat please don't get your hopes up
i didn't see any special results during the time using it that would encourage me to purchase the full size
i wish i had kept the ingredient list to see what might have caused the allergy
'm giving it a go again for those who may have a skin type similar to mine
other than that did not see any other benefit
i just expected more from dior.
i barely used any product
while i do agree with many reviews on here that this is a great cream for the winter
i must say that it is made up of such strong fragrance
love the packaging but had to return.
however, it doesnt work on me.
i think that so many of dior’s “hydra-life” series of products are essentially the same product just called by a slightly different name
go for just one because using all of them is a waste of money
i plan to keep using it
it is very difficult getting the remainder of the product out
that was disappointing when they say it was hydrating
may be returning it for something more worthwhile
so maybe i'll see more of an effect after a little more time
i think it works just as well as other
so far, this product was a waste of money.
i will continue to apply the product hoping for results
so i'll give it that.
it was not nearly as moisturizing as i had hoped or what the product claimed
light so this may be a good pick for others
which would have been nice
i wish i would have known the importance of skin care then
i would give it 0 stars if possible.
this may not be for you
get philosophy "eye believe" which is what was recommended when i returned this product
it did not absorb well
have been hesitant to buy it again simply based on the jar
easy to apply, but actually no effect at all.
if this serum were cheaper i wouldn't feel so bad about it not working
i could have looked over that if the results were good
though i might as well try it
maybe this is meant for more mature skin
in terms of improving the look of my skin it did not do that
however i simply cannot continue to use a product on my face where alcohol is in the top 4 ingredients
i believe it will do more damage than good over time
there are so so so many better serums on the market this one is full of alcohol which causes serious free radical damage
although it appeared to be helping my fine lines
after completely using up this serum i am ready to give an honest review
this was due to worry it would cause a break out.
most definitely it will cause a break out
although i'll give it a bit more time
it had done nothing to refine my skin even though i have used it consistently since purchased day
but i used it faithfully and saw zero results.
unfortunately i had to return it because the cost was just too much to throw away
any other cleanser could have done the same job at a lower price
so far, at least.
for as long as you use it
i definitely expected more
for days i could not figure out what the smell was
then i see in reviews that it's not really an eye cream—it's more of a base
like others have said
i could care less if this works
i didn't notice it working different than any other cream
maybe for younger skin it might be better.
i just must be the one that it doesn't work for.
the thing is that all of the products have alcohol in them designed that way so you continue to buy them
i work very hard for my money so spending almost a hundred dollars on this product must mean i need some serious help for my under eye dilemma
i wanted it to work given how miraculous the sub d is
i will say i'm currently using a different perricone product that i'm much happier with
even though many women think this works good
which i have used
i found it to be just average :
i really had high hopes for this product.
can be worn under make-up with no problems
i feel now i need to try it in conjunction with another eye cream
will just do that in the future
for $95 this night cream should do it all.
i did find it hard to get past the smell at first
needless to say i will be sending it back
surely there is another eye cream out there that is equally effective
they were all about how good the results were.
i will be returning this product.
this may be a good product for you
i could only tolerate this product for a little over a week
surely there must be a way to neutralize such a horrible smell
it was too much i had to return.
then i'm sure more people would be happier
although i have mature
had to return it :/ as much as i tried to make the product work
those two things are important to me
if you are naturally very dry this would be good for you
will not be using any longer once my bottle finishes
hence it gets at least two stars
think it might be a good option for others with dry or normal skin
will try other brand names next time.
it might be fine
i've never had an issue like this with my skin before
i strongly suggest trying on a small patch of skin before use to everyone who buys this
it all stopped once i changed the type of products i use on my face
so when i first wrote a review on this product i had nothing
just got more expensive
i gave it another chance since it might just be the weather doing the changes on my skin
this product took quite some time to dry before i could apply my makeup daily
truly been able to accomplish it
when i found i could not use it on my face
s just to try to get some use out of it
i think this would be good for the winter
the cons are that you have to use a lot more than usual moisturizers
was hoping it would help more than it did
i felt like i had to had to use several pumps to even make my face feel like i could go out in public
if you try to put on more than a tiny drop
so this may have been part of the problem
got this just to prevent those in the rare cases that they do happen
fully intend on returning the product
the only reason why i am giving this product 2 stars is because 1
if it were cheaper i'd probably keep it because it's decent
although it could be good if you are very oily
it may work for some but for me sadly it did not.
thought this might work
hopefully, you will have better luck than i had.
i will say the oil is less than without the product so there are some good qualities about the item
person who told me to purchase this said it would help with my acne
i just could not deal with it any longer
i will be returning it
it also did not help to improve my skin at all
after i use it i always feel like there is oil on my face from the day
i typically do not breakout in that area
hopefully this will work better for others.
i've never enjoyed using a cleanser as much as i did this one
i plan to return this because although it feels luxurious
no amount of 'warming between fingers' is safe enough
i continued to use it thinking that i tried the cleanser at a bad time in my cycle
this product will not be enough to wash away all the make up
i felt like i needed to use a ton of it to cover my whole face
i also read somewhere that clay does not have any cleansing properties or abilities
that was not the case.
this may work for you
i will have to return this
sometimes only once because i'm scared of using it all too quickly
that might be a personal thing
i need something more powerful
not the best moisturizer as it hasn't done what i'd hoped it would
even though it was natural
i hoped this would help my sensitive skin become less red
after that it didn't help as much
this is already in a really small bottle.
i could have gotten a much cheaper moisturizer to do the same
will be returning this the next chance i get.
if you order online you will not get the product as described above
this does not outweigh the fact that
i will have to find a real night cream.
i still get the usual breakout.
now with that being said
i wanted to try something less expensive than going to a dermatologist first as my scars are not horrible
have yet to see any results
with every use i just got more disappointed with this product
then tried looking up different ways for the product to work better
there items that do just as well if not better for a fraction of the price
unfortunately this mask did not live up to its expectations
i often see this being used on social media
it just didn't deliver what i had hoped for
that did make my face smoother for sure
i expected so much more from this product.
when i finally did use it i was a little disappointed in the results
yet there are so manyyyyy for less price i prefer keep doing my research
the results were not worth it.
they both said the same thing
the hype about it made it seem so much better
i would much rather use a pore strip because it is way more effective
that is my situation
so this mask really shouldn't have had too hard of a time pulling any out
i will give this product the benefit of the doubt
i though it would be perfect because it would take them all out
since they are white i can see them
i used more than once
will be returning by the end of it
used it twice hoping the second time would be better
for 32 dollars i was thinking its going to be better then the cheap ones i find on sites like wish
my skin looks worse than it did before i used it.
when i got it i was really hoping it would perform as it says
otherwise i did not see any changes while using this product
not even smooth it like it has to others
didn't extract much from my skin like i had seen in videos
had thought it would do the job
one entire bottle only got me probably 10 usages because a lot of product is required to go over entire face
like other reviews have said
it requires a lot of product to even get it on right
so the amount of uses you get out of this is minimal
not quite enough for full coverage
not sure it will get the results one would hope to encourage a purchase
i think this would work much better as a dry spot helper rather than all over face
i found this to be way too heavy for me
being a big fan of a few other henriksen products i decided to give this a try
i think that will last a while
i think they should make a light version that comes with pump
that is one of two reasons why i stopped using it
i wish they would make more products without it
those of you with a sensitivity to such scents should maybe avoid this one
or at least try it in the store first
i guess they changed their formula
it's not at all as good as it used to be
the consistency used to make it last forever
it was the best product i had found.
i would only recommend this product to someone with mature
if you are looking to stay within the ole henriksen line
i will not use this again.
i tried not to use a lot of it when applying
i will try to use even less
i may try a different product from ole henriksen when this jar is gone
this one was not right for my skin
thought this would be the same
this is some of the worst stuff i have ever used on my face
perhaps my expectations were just too high for this product because i started using a treatment that was formulated specifically for scars
wish it had worked.
i hope i see the effect before i finish the use of this product :
i will be returning this for sure.
not as tight as it once was
unfortunately, i don't have an indoor day job.
people at work started asking me if i was getting suntans
i really have high hopes.
i can't say that i've seen any difference after using this product for months
plenty of products half the price that work just as well
that it was difficult to apply
using this i get the impression that it would be more beneficial to an older woman
it might work well
i wanted this to work for my eye area
should be great for someone, though.
however it takes forever to absorb
could never ever again put this on my face
i should have read about all the ingredients
may be great for others who don't have sensitive skin
thought this would be perfect
i will say i was initially disappointed at the very small amount
too much money for very little effect.
this should be prefaced with my saying i have very sensitive skin
otherwise i would have been upset at myself for not reading the ingredients
t should work better
i gave it 3 stars only bc i think it might have potential for those with normal to oily skin types
other than that it made my face soft
took a chance with this product to see if it would smooth my skin
i spent so much money for this to not work.
maybe i'll continue using it every other day
i think this might work well for normal or combination skin
i would go through an entire jar in like a month because i felt like i could never put enough on my face
love products that can do multiple things
figured this would be just as great
this is the worst i've ever used.
i would only wear this at night because it is quite intense
i will continue to use it
ii have a hard time finding a product that does a great job
like there may be a primer in there
it seemed to be added rather than coming from ingredients
i will say that i have used products that delivered far better results for the same price --
it is probably great for people that have normal skin
i'll try other products next time
both were just ok.
i do not recommend for the people who have sensitive skin
i almost believed them
sephora should be more forthcoming.
i'd save your money and look elsewhere.
this is the best cream i have used so far however i still have some dryness when using it
i think there are better
might be too pricey given there are other products that achieve the same result
annoyed that now i have to go pay to have these professionally removed
i will start by saying this feels amazing once applied
maybe if i use all three in this system it'll work better than my previous methods"
there are other eye creams that works better with the same price
really not sure that it is any more hydrating than other eye products
i'll have to find another product to use on my eye area
was hoping this was the answer for a smoother
could it be that its not working for me?
also would want to return it as it is very expensive
so he will continue using it
hoping that it was just a purging phase or something
maybe using the "extra" every other day
never really was able to work it into my routine
once the small bottle is finished i will seek another product
i felt like for something this basic feeling i could have paid much less
for my age, it's such a must.
the biggest reason why i no longer used this product
those who have loved it for a long time may have noticed a change at some point
one thing i can say about this product is that it has just about disappeared after using this
i think they're are just as good if not better ones from the drugstore or another br
unfortunately i had to return this product
i will have to return it
maybe it would be better for someone with skin that is not as annoying as mine
even with hardly any
i did a lot of research before purchasing this item because i have very oily skin
which can be a pretty look
if it weren't for the product breaking me out both times i wouldn't have returned it
unfortunately this one is a no go.
however i would say for the price there are better moisturizers you can find at a better price point
would be better if it had a dropper
this seems to be a problem
my skin has never been the same after using this stuff
i would prefer it to be both thicker
while i would say it's better than josie maran's face oil i would prefer clarins' face oil to both
as all three are at the same price point i would have to give clarins five stars
there are many other much better options.
i would give this product five stars if it weren't for the strong smell
this has not moisturized the area like i had hoped
i will be returning.
it's been years i've been trying to get rid of those milias
i tried it for quick some time
found it did not do much for my under eye area
for the price i expect a lot more than just hydration
i can see it working for fine lines
i just believe there are better eye creams in this price range
i got it because i wanted one eye cream for both day
've given up on that
still not for as long as i would like though
once i went to apply my other products
it is now a must have in my skin care routine!
although they do tighten
today i will be going back to sephora to discuss my dilemma
there are better products out there!
i believe it also states it can be used as a mask
hoping ptr will come up with a better formula
also on the rare instance that i did not have the issue with the white residue
you were able to see that i have put product on my face as it didn't dry evenly
i wish they can work on that because you certainly felt the tightening effect of the product
but these tips just seemed to remove the product.
surprised they won't correct it after reading the same comments about the residue in these reviews
as soon as you put make up on
or any other special occasion.
it is just very temporary
they are pretty bad
i am hoping to see improvement in this technology by ptr in the future
just wish it was re formulated to appear clear
what a seller told me there was that it might be of better use for older ladies
even though it is recommended for women on their 20s too
as i was lucky enough to have at this point
i personally think it works better as the mask if you use it nightly or daily for an hour as there are some beneficial ingredients
i would imagine it would be the same if i tried any liquid based foundation on top of it too
if you put make-up on then the wrinkles seem to re-appear
i tried it several different ways
once this little problem is solved i'll try it again
i found this very difficult to work with
i will return this if sephora allows it.
will continue to try other products.
i applied as little as possible.
i will say that it was a very tight feel
some of the time there was a white film like others have said
in order for it to work where my fine lines are corrected
as other people have stated
even when it did work with a white film
maybe because i'm still fairly young
i tried using this many different ways
i got tired of trying different ways to make it work
after you apply it on your face or only on some areas
this was not it
while i do not generally return open items
i just thought maybe all those people were using it with a heavy h
i've tried everything with this product
no matter how little you put on there is going to be some level of white
can keep the effect longer in hopes it somehow helps in the long run
you are back to no results
felt exactly as it did before i applied the product
i tried applying very
because perhaps that's already doing as much as can be done
my other products took care of my other lines pretty well
after you wash it off does not leave the face looking a lot different than before using it
i won't really be able to determine its efficacy until i've been using it for a longer period of time
i feel i need more than one pump for face
that i only used it once
initially it worked really well
just used it alone
as i continue to use it throughout the week my skin has been getting worst due to breakouts
it could be just my skin because from other reviews
that was not the case.
or much smoother the way some others have
i found that there were nothing very special about this product
i only needed to use it once to figure out that i wasn't impressed
while i believe that this may work for some people
i'd like something more than average
there are many other spf options out there
i tried to just press it into my skin using a very little amount
whenever i applied this
at first i thought maybe i was putting on too much
it was the first dermadoctor product that i have disliked
anything over 2% causes issues for many
the worst part of all is that it didn't seem to have any anti-aging effects at all in the winter or spring in chicago
it does seem to have some in the summer
does that mean that one needs to be in the sun for several hours to get the anti-aging benefits?
doesn't seem to have any anti-aging benefits if one is not in the sun
very doubtful as each time i put it on
over all i would say i nearly wasted $100 on a small bottle that will go to waste
i know it might be due to the spf
i will just continue using it until i finish it
especially since i apply it to my face
decided it would be great to try
which there are cheaper options out there that do the same without the flakes
this might be great for someone with more time
even though the review was good the product did nothing for my skin
which tends to be a little more time consuming than i care to deal with
need more time to see results, i think.
it may work for some people
if you are not as sensitive as me
i’ve tried it so many different ways
for that i will give it three stars.
as i like a lot of them
i think there are probably better ones out there
i would like to rate it better
if i could actually squeeze the product out
this is just another one that did not work at all
to see if it looked better than the other
waste of money so far.
give it time to work
its a nice addition to whatever regimen you may have
i like the price but wish i had better results!
i wish it would of worked better
wouldn't get this again unless it became cheaper
did nothing to help in any ways mentioned above
not at all what i expected
my expectations might have been a little too high as i expected to see instant results
was hoping for more.
was hoping this would help
not as much as i was hoping
it doesnt work at all
none of the ones i had previously tried ever truly worked
it does its job for the day
however there have been some issues
i won't be back for more.
feels good however i will not be using it again
s though which were not as sensitive
the reason why i give only two stars is that the scent is pleasant
you can definitely find better choices in the same price range
i am hoping they bring back the old formula
so many of you may find this very odd to believe
i like the original one without the lotion in it i think it worked a lot better
not sure if this reformulated one is the same
will have something better that i can spend my money on
oil free for some time now
let me start by saying that my under eye area is big big concern
as the effects of age are so much more powerful than any product i know about
can't say that it really did much for me in terms of anti-aging or lessening of dark circles
i find it much quicker
i will have to open it up to get the cream
i wanted to see if anyone else had this result from using this cream
i saw that others did
be able to get deep under the skin
finally there was so-so coverage
it was still a headache getting all of the product
can at least use it
even though i'm convinced this is the best eye cream out there
why this expensive eye cream can not have a better quality of the bottle
there is no reason to use all of the product within 20days for sure
this isnt what i expected from caudalie
every one working at the store asked if it was for mymom
will not be trying this again
it doesn't seem to be doing its job with long-term use
why this eye cream would be so expensive
to be fair i did used this for about 3 weeks
unfortunately this product does not help with dark circles
thought i would switch up to this higher end product
there are many other products which cost much less yet offer the same results
it didn't really perform better than other eye creams i've used
every pump ends up giving me at least 4 applications worth of product no matter how hard i try to get less
there was so much product left
i also found it a little irritating that at the end
as others have mentioned
hoped this product would work for me
this is one of them
just as she said
no better than the stuff i get for $15 at the natural health food store
heck there should at least be some improvment
don't see any justification for the price plus the weeks wasted when i could have been using a product that delivered on its promises
possibly longer if it had not dried out
i would expect much better
the pump on this bottle not only has been very difficult to work with
i didnt even think it was that hydrating when i was able to get some out
i am giving this product only two stars in the hopes that laura mercier decides to pay attention to the feeback provided by her customers
there are other oil-based face washes out on the market that i will be giving a try
this might be good for some skins
is way too heavy for mine
i know for a fact that it was this cream because i used it on
i've never used a product that made me break out this bad
all i can think about are the animals eyes that the products are tested on
the reviews were so great for this eye cream
maybe i just expected more?
is sometimes good for a 3-star review on that basis alone
i received a sample of this in store so right off the bat keep in mind i was only able to use this for about a week versus long-term
having said so, this eye gel was a very expensive
there are better eye products out there.
so my expectations were on the higher side
i did not notice any visible results or other advantages over other products that are far less expensive
will return it if they take it back
way too quickly than i would like
definitely too expensive for the result
i would expect something better than that
so can a lot of other products
then this will work for you
it was simply not enough for me in fall or winter
i found that it to have a masking effect once you apply it
i can live with that.
this product certainly claims to take on a lot
i did get some advice a while back that there were only a few things that stood out
it was not an easy decision to make
i will definitely be returning this product
if you are able to st
as it does seem promising
at this price point i would expect a product to either have very little alcohol or none at all
if you are somewhat between 20-25 like me
they don't live up to their reputation
or at the very least make the line less visible
she told me that no amount of water will fix that
that our bodies stop producing some type of chemical or oil or something as we get older
then this is the product for you
i can always return it
will i be a repeat customer ?probably not
i will switch back to origins plantscription which was my first choice anyway if not for the convicing sales pitch of the sephora associate
because i will have to try that next time
it works every day i use it making my face brighter
the older i get the more i think i need more head-on anti-aging ingredients than these kind of products have
it could have been caused by this product being too greasy
i spent a lot of $ thinking this will finally help me with my problem
this product did not make my pores smaller or "seem smaller
then it turned out to be just what i needed at the time
this would be a great one
i still have more to go.
this did not last long
continued using it hoping that my pores would eventually get smaller
hoping that to keep the area cleaner
this was my chance to give pore reduction a try
this is the latest in my endeavors to find something to reduce my pores or at least make them look smaller
knowing that this kind of product can take a few weeks of use to reveal its full benefits
unless i have another massive breakout
you might see more benefit from this product
did not see any different when i compare both cheeks
that this was too much
however, it did not work for me at all.
maybe my pores are too big to even be made to look smaller
i hoped that this product would work
i used it for about
hoped that this product
i'll keep using it in the hopes that i didn't spend so much money for nothing
i would say that they are only about 20-30% smaller
let alone any difference in the visibility of my pores when just applying the product as you would with the benefit pore product
have stuck with it more or less because i spent $30 on it
as i'm reading the reviews i see that its working for a lot of people
might start using it again
poors were not smaller at all
only ones that hide them
they where still to big
maybe prolonged use will improve those areas too
didnt help me at all
maybe this was too little product/not enough time for me to see results
for such a expensive product i expected to notice something other than any other moisturizer
some of the perricone ones do
that is how long it took for some users to see results
it would be really helpful for products to specifiy the amount that should be used for each application
they also should make this product smell better.
the salespeople had been trying to talk me into perricone for a long time
cause wrinkles where i had none in way less time than they should be appearing
this wasn't as impressive as i thought it should be
maybe i needed to use it longer.
it did not relieve any of the lines on my face
i used a 1/2 jar of this faithfully even using this on 1/2 of my face while using my other arsenal of products on the other 1/2 of my face
was curious if i'd have more "lift
figuring i'd give it a good long trial period
i do not have an issue with fine lines
t's much too expensive to continue using if all it does is make skin softer
even though you just use a little at a time
think this might be for people with skin that is more dry
i will keep trying
then i read that these two products
after reading the early reviews on this product i thought i would give it a try
this is no magic cream that will take off 10 years
save your money there are many products that work better
they had difficulty with it also
attempting to do it with one h
when i ask them which of the products they carry would be good for a specific purpose
was advised to try it a bit longer
after 15 days my skin does not appear any better than it did before i started using it
i know it was this because i stopped using it for a while
need to get your skin back to where it should be
i feel like this really should be in a pump bottle
i noticed there are women who are proner to breakouts who say they have "sensitive skin
eye cream so thought this would be great
used the product religiously every single day with no results that i could see
this is by far
the worst skin care product i have ever used
the one getting nothing at all
i will not use this product again.
unfortunately, that was not the case for me.
it did not absorb like so many others claimed
at this price point i want something that gives greater results
none of this would matter if i had great results from the product
it was just another reason not to continue using it
i actually already wrote a review for this saying all of the above
it was removed for some reason
so with some research this product seemed like the next big choice
you are going to want to choose between a product that really is anti-aging
still waiting for a credit for this $90 product
i may try it in the summer.
for some reason the jar is never filled correctly
it seems like i am not getting the same results
i tried it for a few weeks to see if i could get used to it
it should be safe for them
i am very disappointed that there were no warnings on the jproduct description
something by murad?this is the first sephora sample that has upset me
now it will be a long road back for my face.
i will be more careful trying out sample products in the future
still look forward to trying the serum
just overall i think there are better options out there
i do realize i have very good skin to begin with
stop using it for a while to make sure it was the algenist that was causing the problems
i gave it one more try.
there is something in there that made me break out like a 15 year old
unfortunately, i had to return it.
it pills up on the face no matter which product i use under it
it has never been particularly sensitive to anything
love the original....but not this one with spf.
would not switch to this product
not for someone who needs help with firmness
will give that a go
i imagine with continued use
it'd be even better
not even half way
they have a new one out that sounds better
although maybe if i was older
was better than this
there are less expensive
plenty of similar products out there for much less
after a few days of using it i did notice a difference in my eyes they were no longer tired looking which i have a huge problem with even though i do get enough sleep i have just always had problems with my tired eyes
this is an average eye cream which doesn't live up to all it says it will do
there are other products that do more than this
i need an eye cream that i can go a few days without
unless you plan on using this cream every single day for the rest of your life
i would not start using it in the first place
even though i used it daily
unfortunately my finelines under my eyes are still there
i feel like i've been seeing more lines develop than before-
that's never happened with any under eye product i've used in the past
it did not reduce fine lines or make me feel any brighter
i saw some reviews said its can see the anti aging after 10 days
keep using this cream until now
the fine line on my eyes still can see they appears
i continue using right now
hope it is can see some result after
3 were both no different
i think it might be good for once a week?
i can now see fine lines
someone said this product is not for younger skin
i will be continuing my search for something that treats my dark circles
your money would be much better spent elsewhere
this would be good
no go with make up which makes it only 3 stars instead of 5
once i went to apply my other products
perhaps if used with other products it would work better- not sure about the residue though
don't use it as much as i had hoped
buy an eye cream that actually works in the long term i think you will be happier with the results vs
this my be better for more advanced skin that needs more tightening
sure enough they were more prominent
as many others have mentioned
can't even imagine how many strong chemicals are in it
typically use this with no makeup cause its hard to with
i wish this also continued to help fine lines not just "temporarily" diminish
cause at the end of the day the fine lines are still there
one day i was looking at all of ptr's products
also found it to be very drying which made it difficult to put make-up on
if i over-apply this
two stars because it actually does tighten
be careful if you have sensitive eyes.
this can come in h
which can not be good for the skin around the eye
i've only recently started to see signs of "fine lines" around the eye so perhaps this product was not meant for me
i think it could work great for those with more of a problem around the eye
if you wear foundation you cannot apply it over areas that has the product on it
have not used it again
the results were better
when i returned it of course something more expensive was recommended
i can see and feel the effects immediately.
as others have noted
if they can figure how to re-formulate
this time so bad i will take it back
also you can absolutely not put make-up or an under eye cover on it
figured i would give this a try after trying the facial firming products
it does not work with any other products
that was enough to work
so i will be returning it to the store.
as long as you use it alone on your face
if any conditions above apply you can pretty much say goodbye to any noticeable effects
for these giants it did nothing
at least not for me
which in turn makes it like all the pore minimizing products out there i have tried
while this product did help my makeup to go on more smoothly
it probably has very little to do with it actually
the places where i applied this looked different under my makeup compared to other parts of my face once the oil started coming though
thought this would be the solution
however i think too faced primed
the amount of product you get
but it didnt work at all for me.
then tried to branch out to see if there was something better
i still prefer this to one to many others
although you have to add quite a bit of water to it in order for it to spread
although that being said
because the one i wanted had been discontinued
if they all are similar to this one
having very dry+sensitive skin i was very open to this
this did not met my expectations to say the least
it was always the same
not the case at all.
it is as if you are spending a thick
not worth the price because this stuff seriously works no better than baby oil
like it had not been cleaned well
so am guessing this is the culprit to both of my concerns with the oil
have enjoyed other oils much more both for the ability to use it
my only disappointment is that disappointed is that it didn't remove all my eye makeup as easily as another oil cleanser i had tried recently
not as easy to use as before.
the oil did not move easily across my skin
need to go in with the right expectations
so you have to get just the right amount to even make it work
anyway i've been trying to use it because i paid so much for it
tried adding a lot of water as per the instructions
i gave it two stars because it must last long.
i also did not use this under foundation.
the reasons why i would give this product some stars are:1
i only used this
as i never experienced this before
i made sure to use barely any each time
it would be best used only at night because no one wants to leave the house with a greasy mask on
it worked so well that i used the entire bottle
at the time i didn't know what the culprit was for the new bumps i was getting more
it would be more suitable for a night cream as it didn't fully absorb into my skin
this might work better for you
will be going back
it didn't get healthier in any way.
honestly, i had high hopes but didnt like it.
not nervous at all to use this product
i also started a couple of other new things
wanted to make sure it was the serum
it was far too expensive for how long it lasted
that my skin can benefit from more
the other 1 for the pretty case.
there are too many negatives
not worth $50 - just waiting for it to run out.
i would opt for something with better ingredients
others may like it
did not help with fine lines.
it appeared to be a completely different product
either this was a 'bad bunch' or they changed the product
thought i'd give this a try based on the reviews.
ended up retuning it because it felt like it should yield some results for its price tag
have never reacted this way to a product
unfortunately it was just a waste of money
most of their products have been amazing for me
i should have returned
i am using it as quickly
it did not absorb very well
have had a lot of trouble finding an eye cream that doesn't cause a problem after continued use
can advise if its good for that
used the whole pot, with no results to speak of.
this may help you
for my only skin i could only use it at night since it it a bit heavier
i will wait a few more weeks to complexity decide on that
thought this may be just what it needed.
just not what it was advertised for on this site
it must have been doing something because sometimes it stung a little like some treatments do
could it be that my wrinkles are actually deeper after using this product?
use high-end products regularly so my skin was in pretty good condition to begin with
we do need to be aware that not all products produce the same results for all people
this may be formulated to work on a different kind of skin
will definitely be more cautious now.
i think it might have made some skin tags worse though
i've tried so many products to try
thought it could work as primer for your under eyes
without any make up
for so much money
i found this product just too expensive for little results
have even tried the clinique "even better eyes" to no avail
i would say there wasn't much of a difference with dark circles in the long run after 4 months of use
i would recommend this for younger skin types didn't see much of a pay off with anti-aging benefits
while i have not seen any results yet
i guess this is the product at the beginning
honestly the results are just average
have had the same results
i sure wish there was something that worked as promised
unless i see some semblance of a result in the next week
i agree with other reviewers that it is hard to apply make up over it
this may be why i didn't have great results?
it did not improve them
want others to know that there are people who aren't happy with this product
i really hoped this product would work for me.
after using this for a number of week i am sad to report it really has not done anything to change the look of the dark circles
it will start to diminish the look of them
give it some time
which are not that bad to begin with
i've used it for about 2 week to see if i had any results
did not absorb very well
it did not absorb very well
from what it sounds like from the other reviews however
happy about the easy return, though!
there are far better products out there for less than half the money
had no irritation with this which is why i give it three stars
was really hoping this eye cream would work
really would have loved this cream to be just as effective as kate's other products
never seems to make it on???
i don't see this eye cream working for that purpose at all
not in my case
for that price i thought i was getting something better
i will keep looking :-( returning this.
also to prevent some fine lines from getting worse
will not be finishing the whole product
using it a week later to see if it the dryness had been caused by anything else
it didn't deliver on any of the five points
their line usually works for me
i figured it needed more time to work on the fine-lines i'm starting to see
i'd rather use a product that can do more than just one thing for the eye area
those benefits were short lived
after couple uses areas where i used this product did become irritated
this product did not work at at all!
have had great success using many of their products
just fine for the money but not very effective.
thought that this might be a good night-time eye cream
i will have to return it
while i find this line is gentle i just am not seeing any results that would warrant me purchasing it again
feel confident in saying that i truly experienced this product as it was meant to be used
what about the results?
but it did nothing for those lines.
it did brighten but i had to stop using it...
i used this product only 1 time
even after i tried to do it as gently as possible for a short amount of time
like other reviewers have said
so you end up getting too much
it would hurt my face so much when i used it
however i did not realize it was not intended for daily use
you may be able to get away with it
the girl who helped me said it would be good for my sensitive
said it would be good for my sensitive
i might just go the diy route next time
can be dry in other parts
only time i used it
i would estimate that there is about half that amount in the tube
yet does not contain much product
looking at the ounces there is not much here for your money
above says it all the results were very poor had to return
this product did nothing for me over the 3 months that i used it religiously
which it hasn't helped at all with
may be off-putting to some
i wanted to like it but had to return it.
i really had high hopes after reading some of the reviews
i tend to go for some of the more natural products which is why i sprung for this one
they are totally worth the expense if they work
which i can tolerate as long as the product is good enough
once that is all done
or in any way better than it did before
might not be the skin product
i'll be using the aha concentrate on its own for now on
returning and trying something new.
plus it is so sticky that it was hard to use under make up
it might work for others
i just find it takes longer to completely spread the product around my eye area
really wanted to like it as much as his other products
all other key ingredients that you would want to take care of the under eye area
i will just use it up for other areas.
since i haven't found too many that do
get some in it
most of their products i tried so far have worked for me
i also agree if this product is used anywhere near the eye area
i can continue to use it below my eyes as long as i don't come close to the eye area
i realized it was time to find something to replace it
so as much as i was all set to buy this
use a few others from him
i used this for quite some time
this seems like it could work for some
that means it should only be used for daytime
will be returning the product
they have yet to respond
one even states that it produced those hard
did not find it to be effective although the cream is thick upon application
do not put my contacts in
i am still trying various products throughout the line
some work well for me
others not so much
i will be trying something different with my next purchase
stinging even though i made sure not to put this too close to them
not sure its the best
it is probably just as good as the higher cost eye creams at sephora
many of which i have tried
decided to use both at the same time on either eye
after about 3 weeks unfortunately neither are for me
so with that said
for $65 i would use that money elsewhere.
i'll be trying a different product now that i've run out of this
or at least i "think" so
or at least it was for me
if they work as claimed
it didn't hydrate nearly as well or as long as i would have liked
i might have to return it
almost showed more lines than normally i can see
if may be going back.
this is almost too far the other way
in fact i think it might be responsible for me getting acne on my chest
t's still too early to decide
it was recommend by a beauty consultant on site at sephora for a day so only time will tell
i must have super sensitive skin because this just did not work for me
will continue to use until it is gone.
we both asked each other
my search for an amazing eye cream will continue though
have tried many in my quest
i will keep looking!
i still see the same lines
probably also because i had already been using good eye creams
it seems to work better on some days than others.
i found that i needed a bit more to actually have any affect
it did not feel as gentle on my very sensitive eyes as the origins product i had been using
has not caused bumps i have gotten from other products which are too rich
will definitely be going back to the store
this moisturizer is no better than any other low-end product i've tried
if i lived closer to a store i would definitely return
out of all the perricone face products this is the only one i can use
do believe its over priced for the amount you're getting however will continue to use as works well
for $75.00, it should at least come in a tube.
this product comes no where close in my opinion.
they are both average.
am going continue as long as it lasts to see if the results improve
may be too heavy for my particular skin type
i think i had higher hopes for this to work.
some spots seem more pronounced than they were before
i should have my $75.00 back.
as a matter of fact i feel like they got bigger since i've been using it
will return the rest of the bottle as soon as i get a chance
i've seen several complaints about the product not lasting as long as people thought it would
i guarantee you people would use it extremely sparingly
there is not much product in it
not as much as i would like
which i did not previously have
they're fading but they might have without this.
will be taking back.
i tried putting it on after other products as well
i will still keep using it until it it is all gone
i expect it to make some sort of difference by week 4
there has has never been a product that i refused to use for that reason
i would never by it
for that reason i can give it only three stars.
5 oz because there are half people said this is a good product
have tried to use it for a long time
there has to be way cheaper options out there.
am disappointed that i spent 100 points on it without knowing anything about it
this just like no others
it was the only new product i used in my routine
this is by far the worst face product i've ever tried
therefore it's hard to make a definitive judgement after just one use
will give them that
i would give zero star i could
i may have had a better experience using less balm
it was honestly the worst product ever that i just has to warn everyone else before they might spend their actual hard earned money on it
if there was such a thing
used it with my clarisonic
i can see how this might be well-suited to one-step cleansing
as part of a two-step it is far too heavy
would love to try this product more.
this may or may not work
i just felt as though i did not get the deep clean i was hoping for
the only way i could try it was to get the sample
the effort in using this was just too much work
went online to find the proper way to use it
am familiar with how to use these
i just think for the money this should work a lot better
i've never been so disappointed because now i have to go through the trouble to find something else
ncredibly horrible i have no idea how they get away with charging so much for it
there is not a single aspect about it that i would seem positive
because there was no way i could continue using it :
this might work better with different skin types though
this definitely is not for those of us who have extremely sensitive skin
i should have paid more attention to the reviews about the smell as it is just something i can't get past
sadly, this will be returned.
so there wasn't much benefit compared to others in mid
this is the only product in my algenist collection that i am just 'meh' about
i am not a person who usually makes a big deal about fragrance
which it is not
just to get some use out of it
hope to see better results
its not the best either
found it too strong for my face
i believe that was the problem with the algenist.
i plan on using theirs
i like that one better
maybe some kind of difference will show up after longer use combined with other algenist products-
i believe i'll be returning to algenist
i used it for two months hoping to see some improvements in the quality of my skin
so perhaps it will just take a little adjusting to
i ultimately returned it because of the strong
had herd such great things
which has gotten better as i've stopped using this
so will have to return
know for sure it was in fact this product causing my issues
i could only get about 3/4 of the product out of the pump
let me say that i have tried several products from algenist
they eventually did write back to say the product was appropriate for sensitive skin
i used it as one
i will keep this product in mind for 10 years down the road or so
returned it for that price it should have done more
within 5 minutes not be able to tell whether i've applied it or not
i also do no like that it is in a small jar
only used it once.
something in this product just did not react well with my skin even with the adjustment period for skin turn-over
i should have tried it before buying a whole jar
this was clearly not for me.
they have some amazing products.
it did not absorb quickly as some of the other ladies have stated
like other reviewers have said
in this case i feel the need to
been using for a month now-i do not see one difference in my skin's appearance
want to return but think its too late.
there are other masks that do as good as a job
so know i only use it once maybe twice in a week depending how i feel
meaning if i feel like my face is looking tired from working so much
knew immediately they were from this product
wanted to try more of the line
it definitely did not meet up to the quality or results of the other amore pacific products that i have used
because i only used it once
i hoped this would be the intensive care my skin needed
it does disappear into the skin as other reviewers have said
this might have been a good product
ultimately, i had to agree.
the store associate promised that this was so much better
i will not be ordering this again.
i think i can definitely a cheaper substitution for $20 for another sleeping mask
i would not recommend if you have sensitive skin because i'm assuming that is why it reacted that way for both of us
which is what i was hoping for
went with clinique since they have traditionally been good to me
i probably need something a little lighter
had high hopes for this one
i'd been hearing such good things about their new products that i decided to trust the reviews
"combination oily" skin was probably not going to be true to at least one of those categories
have no job at the moment :/
try new ones often
there is much better out there in the micellar market
i generally do not have sensitive
it would be a good product
i will be returning it.
when i need more i'll
used it anyway to test it out
when used all over the face the scent can be strong
i am still unsure about this product.
how so many people are saying this removes their eye makeup so well
they said it is the one they use in the store
will be returning it.
i find that i need to leave it on longer
are better products out there.
there are plenty of better options to clean your face than this
i agree with some reviewers that the smell is rather strong
there are better products out there
i currently fighting have an awful breakout all over my face
i've never had this happen to me with any product until i removed make up with this
i do not see or feel a great difference in terms of result
there are, however, two things i like about this.
this would be a product i consider
it does take a while to absorb
however it didnt do a great job treating the dark circles or depuffing
i will continue using since i do like the fact that it has a hint of brightener
again that could just be because of my sensitivity
i loved being able to try this product out for free from influenster
i would definitely only use this at night
i've only used it once
so i had high hopes for this product.
it did not absorb quickly and felt quite heavy.
you need to give it quite some time before it feels fully absorbed
although i received this product free for review i have to say that i am disappointed in it
does not really have the properties that it claims to have
it may do better as a very natural looking highlight than as an eye cream
i feel it should be helping alot better than it does for that issue
watched the instructional video because i have definitely been applying too much product
as soon as i used this
have never used any of the products from origins before
the other products in this skin care line all have a great smell to them
i read many other reviews with people being very happy with it
i don't have dark circles or wrinkles so all i could hope for was depuffing
which is what i thought the purpose of the wash was for
now i'm using it again
i really expected more when it came to this product
the bad reviews are right
i definitely will use it up
will probably only use it as such
my skin is usually relatively clear with just a spot or two here
i can see that origins has products that are specifically meant for dry
looks like i'll have to do my own research from now on
i will also add that a lot of people commented saying they got the smaller size
very disappointed and will need to return this.
i tried this product out because of all the positive reviews
i will be returning this
i seem to be having an acne breakout like i used to have in high school
not going to continue using this
i used this for a while now given that the little bottle lasts quite a while
however i found that other options from the drugstore worked better for me
that was about where its effectiveness seemed to end
getting rid of them entirely?
there are probably similar products that can be purchased at sephora or elsewhere that work better
i've heard so many great things about this product from my friends who've used it in the past
it felt like they would take longer to heal since it became so flakey
bought this in hope that it would work wonders
i find this improves any break outs i have
i don't anticipate needing that for quite some time
therefore i thought this would be the perfect product
when i first bought this product i thought it would be very helpful because it was more on the expensive side of things
it could have also been from other products as well
overall coming from a somewhat pimpley teen with combination skin if you have the same skin as me i would recommend trying this product
haven't found it to help at all
i am just having a hard time justifying spending $20 on such a small bottle
i desperately wanted to believe in this product
would recommend that those wishing to purchase this product try a sample first
had high hopes that this would help calm that
at least with any urgency
i tried this since i like many of the other origins products
had bad hormonal breakouts it did help a little however after reading reviews i was expecting something better
it did not work as well as i wanted to.
it's better than a lot of other products that claim to have salicylic acid in them
wish they came in larger sizes for people who want to incorporate it into their skin care routine
you will need couple of applications to see the results
the small package does not allow you to use all over the face
this had so many good reviews
had really high hopes for it
rather than making it worse
a lot of money for so little a bottle.
i tried not to have high expectations
you could even apply this before make up
you can try to slow it down which is why i have been trying all sorts of "anti aging" "age-erasing" "fine lines
okay with the fact that it does seem to be holding the progression of lines
maybe after i have tried a few other lines
disappointed to see the long list of ingredients that are actually in this product once i received it
this is the one they felt was best for my skin type
had to return it so can't say much about the long term benefits
i like others better
i may try the oil free version of this
it was always the same
very nice to use but so are others.
it makes me doubt if the products layered on it will lose their efficacy when used after it
it seems like it will last a long time
just wish it had been more beneficial
heard that this would help with that
i would be very careful with using it
i will be taking this product back.
even knowing how sensitive my skin is didn't read the ingredient list before buying
i can see why this is so highly recommended.
my only concern is that people with sensitive skin be care there are a ton of fragrances in this stuff
it may be good for some
i just have to use a bit more than some other creams
we both used it
i've given this so much try
it may have even contri
i didn't think much of it since i was also getting over a cold
i do not have sensitive skin so this was very shocking
the breakouts are now diminishing which leads me to believe it was from this
perhaps i should have tried the oil-free version of this
only after i stopped using it did i realize that this was the problem all along
i would go so far as to say it actually dried my skin out more
sadly this was one of them
other then those two problems it's a good night cream just wished it would've worked out for me
plus it has sls which unfortunately i didn't see when i placed my order
i will be returning this for sure!
will be switching back
at first i thought it was because i was changing products
balances because i thought it would be better
i am finding my skin breaking out more than ever
hopefully this is because i just starting using it
i really wanted to start using more natural products for my face
the more i used it
as much as i wanted this to work
this would be perfect for anyone
also be careful not to get it in your eyes
because they will burn
i used it for 2 or 3 weeks hoping that it would get better
i can't give this a fair rating because my skin has been problematic for a couple of months now
found that it just work for me
who i would say has "normal" skin
still enjoy using this
i don't seem to be drawn to using any mask in particular
expected this to feel similar
i tested it out and the results were not bad!
maybe except some of them like two or three
it seems as though it's not helping in the long wrong with my pores issues
even though i've used this off
the biggest problem i have with this mask is how difficult it is to wash off
don't cause me to be aggressive in order to remove them
which is what i primarily wanted out of this product
continue my never ending search once more
both worked better than this one
i expected a lot more from this product after reading so many reviews raving about this product
even if i use it every week
i will say that it seems to last quite a while
it didn't live up the the expectations
one of the people that work there recommended me this mask
i do not recommend this mask as i have used it for at least a month now yet no results have shown
t could have been either one that helped with that
t must be an ingredient in he product not too sure
i still do even with this product
maybe if i had tons
i've used too much to be able to do that
especially anything from fresh
yes i know there are much more expensive masks
you can't find a better one at the drugstore for half the cost
will give it a few more attempts
optimistically that it will work this time
i would not purchase as my skin didn't particularly look great after using
it actually made the mask a little better when using it
i just happen to be one of the unlucky ones :/ aside from that
it doesn't work well at all under make up
i didn't have any positive ones either
wish i could give zero stars for the irritation it was horrible
especially if i use it right before my conselor
which is why i’m giving it three stars
other than that it's like putting nothing on
but i will try other lines (of origins surely).
this one does not work well under make up
but i will still use the rest of this first.
this product made them worse
wanting something with a few more anti-aging benefits
will definitely be returning.
if i use it in the am
i therefore do not recommend it to people with very sensitive eyes who tend to water up easily
again, it could just be my skin.
as much as i wanted to like it
it just did not work nearly as well as the philosophy eye cream i have used for the last 2 years
maybe this one will be enough on a normal younger skin
the cleanser initially clears access oil however it does not last for the whole day
have good results with it
hopefully i can find my receipt to return this
at first i thought i was going to like this because it made my face feel super clean
i normally used it with my clarsonic
much worse than it had been to begin with.
i used it with my clarisonic
thought i could help combat this with zero oil
i feel like i would get the same results from a drug store product
i must say, this product rocks.
this seemed to make my face not only produce more oil
it has reduced some but not a lot.
so that may be better
this would be good
guess i'll be returning this as well
no more origins for me for sure
maybe the others will work better for me
i expected to like this
well at least it did not harm
that is the best one i have ever used
the only one i will use in the future
except for this one
when i used it
i might just have to try it a few morw times
not a lot of products work for me
not the deep drink i was hoping for
maybe for younger skin it would work!
looks the same as it did before use of the mask
if i need to limit the amount of how much i use it
i tried it because i already have a heavy duty
my face was looking like an oil slick *sigh* this product would work better for people who have normal skin
ask for a sample before buying-it might work for some people
didn't help with oil control at all
not sure if the price was worth how quickly i went through it
if there was more product for the same price i might feel differently
knowing what is in the products i'm putting on my face is always a plus
thought this could be the product for me
its not so bad that i would have returned it
decided to try it after seeing the long "formulated without" list
while they both live up to their claims
i will keep this for those bad weeks
most likely it will be useful in the warm months
i need to find something a little more intensive until then
i prefer a jar so that i know i'll be able to use 100% of the product i paid for
definitely will be returning.
i decided to give this a try due to the oil free aspect
i would have to put more on throughout the day
it seems that most of you have had some good luck with it
it was not what i expected
which is why i have 2 stars
maybe it works for other people
the next day wasn't any better
this has to be the worst product i've ever used
thought this would be my saving grace
which was a nice change from the masks i'm usually using
you can get a bunch of uses out of it if you use it as a spot treatment by only opening one corner of it
which could be why this did not work
did not help with breakout
much better ones out there.
they might be the only reasons that kept me from using the product
i used it in multiple way
leave it in longer or use it as spot treatment
i believe i could find other alternative effective
i am getting no where
some people say you can use it for spot treatment
i think for the price there are definitely better options out there
the lack of hydration was not even close to what the product claims to do
i think my skin is worse than when i started using it
you used to be the best skin line
as others have noted
the minute i find something that works as well
do not actually have as many skin benefitting qualities that one would think based off of the product claims
it will be going back.
the time spent using it does not add us
the amount we are given is ridiculous to think it would last more than a month
i would have given this product 5 stars if the packaging had been a more practical one
not a lot of product either.
did not absorb well
would watch out with this product
it grey so you have to be very careful
it didn't have as much in it as i expected
this would be a good choice
a jar would be better than the pump thing.
she told me this would help since it is a gel
i would buy this again if they just changed to a normal pump or tube
at times a little too much
will be returning for a product that does a little more
the more i used it the more i noticed that i started to get breakouts in places i never had before
i chose this as a replacement since that one is too expensive
i should have known better than to deviate away from my normal moisturizer
my eye area did not feel moistured a total waste of money for this product
was very disappointed with this cream despite being told by multiple people that it was a good cream
this might be a good thing for some
as i'm only 25 i want to prevent this as long as possible
not just a couple the entire are was full of them you could see it under my concealer
noticed my fine lines that were setting in are probably about 6-7x worse i'm not even exhadurating
i guess its supposed to be more preventative
i did not find this product useful.
it did not make a difference to my skin especially for the amount of money i paid
does not absorb very well.
i am still searching for an eye cream that seems to be doing anything other than irritating my eyes
it has not helped diminish fine lines i'm starting to develop
this may not be for you
sagginess in the description i have now
not that i would expect that quick of a turn around time
i wish it had been better
i never saw any long term benefits
i see no benefit at all
now i use it as a primer because i think if i use it as a concentrate
i wish clinique would bring back the old formula!
i've tried using it just at night to see if it absorbs better
which i'd hoped the turnaround concentrate would take care of on its own
i am not sure which one is the culprit.
have used better for cheaper.
the only time i can really use it is at night.
i wish i had kept the box so that i could return it
have to wait so long to put on makeup after because it feels like it is just sitting on my face
i saw many good reviews on this
even most of the reviews claims it to be good
then i tried to put more product because i thought i was putting too little
this was beyond anything for how heavy it was.
i think it would be best left to those with extremely dry skin
but this is going back.
thought i will need to get this one instead of the regular one
i saw this dry combination skin version have very good review also so wanted to give it a try during the dry winter months
feel it is too soon to give a fair review about its effectiveness
i will continue to use the product to see what the results are like
perhaps i need to give it more of a chance to perform?
this could be the case.
i am still open to trying other products in this line
i must say they have the worst
every time i use it
i will wait to see results
do not recommend many better products for same or less money
unfortunately this will not be it.
it just got worse the more i used it
though it does say to use for 28 days
could not see any beneficial effects plus the hydrating result was just not there
have used better products in the past
am not sure if this is a great anti-aging treatment
i may purchase this in the future as i really liked the quick absorption
not sure how well this product works as i was not able to use it very long
i didn't see any results after consistent use.
with so many other great serums out there
i am going to move on from here
unfortunately after just one use
i may have had same result with sugar water
they were out of it
on about how he uses
he said i could use it all over the eye day
am usually only interested in reading reviews from those in my age group because i'm very serious about my anti-aging regimen
think they are great
it seems i'll still be on the lookout for the best
in my mid-30's want to act now to ensure they stay young
this product seemed like the answer
this product was not for me
i figured perricone's co would know better than to put it in any eye product
probably the only person in the world not in love with this
it was too many things to apply
the glutithione cream for face is great if you are not sensitive
two weeks into it i guess maybe i see a very small improvement
might not be the best c
'm waiting still for better results
all the enthusiasm from the sales people made me stick it out
not the best not the worst
hope that i'll see more improvement before i ever consider spending this much on an eye treatment again
will see after done with the bottle
this is his first product that i have not given a 5 star review
had high hopes for this one
this product did not work at all for my skin.
neither did it help in any way
i will continue using it in the hope that it will stave off future wrinkles
the worst part was that i would still have makeup on my face
that the only way i felt this product was effective
i continue using it
since i heard such good reviews about it
've given it a fair chance
when i rebought i felt it was hit or miss with my skin i would use it as maybe after doing one of there masks works amazing
not even compensating with moisturizer was able to prevent the break outs
one of the associates told me that i shouldn't be using this everyday
didn't seem to work as well as i'd hoped
also this product has made me break out more than usual which has never happened to me
i feel like it should be done with that by now
i feel like this is more for someone who doesn't have that much problems with their skin
not for very heavy make up
i can't get the built up product out so that it will work
the only reason i'm giving it two stars
i would only give this product 5 stars if it made my skin feel fresh
after a fair go of it
haven't found any products that have really helped
which you can get for under 20 dollars
when other alternatives can be used
this must be a joke.
too expensive for so little return.
i cannot say whether or not it is effective at firming because i had to discontinue use after the breakouts
for the price it should have done something
for nearly $100, i would expect some results.
probably too young to see the benefits of this expensive cream
either they are lying or work for the company in one way or another
i try all the products at sephora
it does seem to be tightening
it will last me quite some time
like some people have already pointed out
it is supposed to be ultra firming but it is not.
as first impressions go though this cream is worth a try
wish it had kept working for me
other than that i did not see any results
i used it for 12 weeks hoping that my skin would adjust
i didn't see the "results" like most reviews
sadly i must return.
it would still be useless
i will try other algenist products.
however, as far as results go, i'm still waiting.
i don't have high hopes
should see difference by then
then you might need to be cautious with this one
wish it had worked for me as well as it's worked for a lot of the reviewers
by reading other reviews it seemed to work for others
was really expecting more after the reviews.
algenist should put this as a 10-day treatment b/c it makes it worse after
so now, i need something for the new lines.
all the help they can get most days
i also felt as though there was too much pulling
have not used it long enough
how in the world am i going to apply eye makeup as my eyes are so tired
it is a longer term commitment if you want the results claimed by the product
i would like to see some kind of sign however small that it is working
i will give it at least 30 days before i decide to return or not
not bad enough that i'm returning it
said something about being mattifying
it seems like it would work well on sensitive skin
in the end not every product is for everyone
there is only about 1
i will not be purchasing anything else in their line
whatever effect this product initially has on my skin
i would give it one star for that
i would not recommend this product as it is only a waste of money
will work for me
not a bad product at all.
it has been working well with that
i will be returning this product i am very unhappy with the results
there are days when it seems to be the same
i will probably try something different next time
hoped this would work
it ended up making my face produce even more oil than usual
will be returning it.
sadly because i had high hopes for this
when i used it
i felt for the $$ it should be the balm
however it does give good results.
this product was ok after few uses.
oil on top or even alone
i am so disappointed on the outcome after using this product
i keep on giving this product a chance because its not cheap
especially for something i'm trying to sleep in
that being said i was not ready to pay $60 on that one
i can see this causing problems for me in the future because of the scent
since i know it works i will probably keep using it
i really was optimistic when trying it out
like some others noted
would not recommend at all.
i liked this until it cause me to breakout in places i haven't had breakouts in for many years
the bumps made it not worth it at the moment
the only issue i have is that it's hard to spread
you have to use more
considering i've had other products that work just as great
this makes it harder to use
this being one of them
i may have to start the dreaded search for a different one again if the old packaging doesn't return
i will stick with this
the amount of waste that will be left behind
i too will be cutting the package open to get everything out
as stated by many of the long
like others have stated
i love being able to scoop out just the right amount
was probably the first lipbalm i ever tried i was probably like 6 or 7 may be
nice to have around if you have the extra cash which is getting a bit tough these days trying to afford everything
after trying several times i'm just not a huge fan of the texture
better try before because this is a huge amount of product
too much work for everyday use
it did much better job at doing all of those things
but not this one.
i think it would have been better
never had this issue with those
never felt better after all
that was a new for me
than what i've been using
unfortunately my pocketbook is more important now than it ever has been
i also tried to use it every other day
i see no difference after using it religiously
when i first started using this i was extremely happy with the results
this one was a no go for me
that i decided that it was something that i could benefit from
seemed like a bunch of chemicals that could not be good for your skin in the long run
you have to be quick
for the hype that i was given with this product i expected better results
i am so happy they have a great return policy.
that even if the product worked
one of the worst products i've probably ever tried only because i couldn't get past the aerosol
i would imagine dangerous to both your health
for the $, i expected better results.
there are way too many product out there to waste time
too expensive to have to be dealing with that!
have used this for a month+
although i can hear that the can is half full
when it was working
way too much money for no result.
the aerosole stops working about 1/2 they way through your product
i bet i have more than 1/2 of the product in the can yet
the results it is not
while i do like the results i'm seeing
still had the same results
i want to be able to use the product twice a day as directed
even if i have to use it once per day
then by all means
i should add that i'm not in my 20's
had decent results with that
what sold me on this product was when the sales person told me it would help with the deeper lines around my mouth
i tried it for over a month to give it the benefit of doubt
this is way too sticky for me to use consistently
perhaps this could be tolerated at night
i didn't use it long enough to be able to comment on its effectiveness
no dimishing of lines at all.
i expected to start seeing some results
not the best by any means
i wanted badly to believe the salesperson at sephora who claimed this was one of the best products out there
i think if they made a change to it i would buy in the future
didn't absorb as fast as i'd have liked
i know from experience that there are ways to filter
i will continue to use it
she should seek other employment
much more expensive than it should be
it didn't fully absorb
expected to love this one
it may be a good cream
i bet there are other products that give better results
there i said it.
seriously i've never written a bad review for any product so this is a first
this will be going back to sephora
'm unsure of the possible benefits
i will enter a new review when i try that
not sure this would be my favorite product though
it could be a miralce worker for all i know
there has to be better stuff out there.
i will definitely be returning this
not in a good way like others
something is not agreeing with my skin
i'd always preferred bliss' the youth as we know it
maybe they get better commissions from this br
i really only wanted to use this on my eye skin because of teh breakouts on other areas
it can be good,but for certain skin types.
i also rated it so low because i feel it causes more damage the good
which i find to be the case with many oh products
so they lose their function
i've also been pleasantly surprised by how well this product
i kept using it hoping i would eventually get over it or maybe i'd see the benefits of using it
with my super dry skin i figured that this one would be even better
or look at it.
i should have read the reviews more closely.
i will never be able to find out because the smell is unbearable
although i did read later in the description that it is a combination of citrus
as far as how it worked.
had to exchange it for something else
have yet to find the perfect product to control that
the bar did a lot to help it
because i am just the same without it
this is supposed to help control oil
i feel like it would last quite a while.
i am not as impressed by the oil reduction as i was hoping i would be
am going to continue to try other products
my skin is no less oily when using this product than it is when i use others
at first i was impressed with this product because it did seem to be working for a while
not only does this product not work very well
i wish this would have worked out...
i will use up what i have
to be the all in one i wanted
was expecting a better product after such great reviews
to cover my whole face i needed a lot of product
i will be returning
i started using this in my skincare routine because the reviews were really good
but this thing has almost no product!
if this was way cheaper like $10
it does provide relief when my eyes are super tired
there are way better products out there *cough* first aid beauty eye am gel *cough*
since then i always make sure i have it when traveling
haven't used it long term consistently to see how it works on wrinkles
my first thought was to send it back no matter how well it worked
figured this would be another great product
i've had this on my list of things to try for a while
of course i don't have time for a full face
i so wanted this to be my solution.
times you use it
has a separate cap which is not really useful as the stick dried within a month
like other reviewers have said
i willingly shell out more money than i'd care to admit for quality products
i've tried other eye products that felt better
as many other reviews said
i wanted to try a new eye product
i generally don't have sensitive skin so not sure what other product was in there that caused this
it does leave a nice cooling effect as mentioned numerous times throughout these reviews
i look forward to trying a different product.
i used it up already
maybe it works for other people
i figured there would be more product
so far i have yet to find a good cooling eye product anywhere near worth the money
this is running out already while the other products are almost full
will not be using this again!
need to keep using a little more
which is not what i was after
in regards to previous reviews that say their eyes burned when they used it-maybe they got it too close to their eyes?
i will not be trying this product again.
i will be returning this product.
will still be on the search for a more effective produt
it felt like they were burning
if i would have
i probably would have tried it until the end of the jar
even though i have combination skin
it may work really well
not even the fine ones
i looked forward to have my skin to be all balanced
i believe this would work very well
maybe its better for people who are not sensitive skin
i really had high hopes for this one
it became more clear that i could have used something much better for my under eye skin
their return policy is hard to follow if not impossible due to super narrow return period
few good things to say about it are
for the price i think there are other eye treatments that work better
did not absorb well
i erroneously thought i had “acne” because i always had some kind of pimple on my face
that being said it's not the greatest clay mask out there
there are less expensive alternatives out there that will do the same
i'd hoped for better results
there is enough product only for a few masks
also last you a long way: is not the case with omorovicza masks at all
as it was in my case
for the price it really should work better
they can get their money
unfortunately i'm going to have to return it.
will be going back to that
i wish there were a way to resolve this problem because it's making me hesitant to purchase other products from clinique that require a pump
you have to use it religiously
i expected a lot more out of clinique- especially with the hype about the even better line
doesn't help spots at all
i didnt expect it to work so quickly
sadly, will have to return it.
i gave this review two stars because of how great the ingredients in this product are
i do need to apply mousturiser in addition to this oil later on in the day
it was the same thing all over
heard that this would be a perfect fit
maybe i need to be using it two times a day
as a lot of oils are great because they work
i definitely will use it to the end
i've liked other oils that are cheaper just as well
especially in the areas where i usually break out
didn't give my skin any benefits that i'm not already getting from having used coconut oil for the last two years
a half i would have been ok it if it worked
i did not come across any bad reviews on the web at all
- i used it both am
final notes:that is $125 i will never see again
i am ok spending so much on good skin care products provided it works even 10%
maybe i will try drugstore products now.
i should have stuck with just the "good genes".
maybe it is for more mature skin
wanted to see if it would help minimize my stressful breakouts
the results that i have experienced have not even been worth the smell let alone the outrageous price of this product
it hasn't helped with that either
after using it for a few days it made my combo skin so dry you would not believe it
even once a week is too much.
t's hard to see a reason to continue with this
i believe for $158 you should be able to provide a good smelling product
this product would probably benefit people with mature skin the most
assumed this would really benefit me
being mid 20s i guess there are better products out there for
2 weeks should be more than enough to see if a product works especially if you're paying $105 for a bottle
i read reviews that suggested that this was to be expected
beware that if you are breaking out after using this
i figured it was part of the process
so my conclusion is that
you have to test it out
as others have said though
just better to be safe than sorry!
not quite what i was hoping for
try cheaper alternatives until you absolutely need this
how so many people saw immediate results
i hoped it would help with that
i might be too young for this product
getting the smaller size with luna definitely made me less frustrated about gg not working out
for the price there has to be better cleansers out there
like 2 or 3 new areas where i never break out at
i did not want to use it again because my skin was already so broken out from it
it was no helpful at all
one of the worst i've ever used
difficult to keep in my h
no better than any other face wash
i like it a lot more
they both get the job done.
you will get smaller
there are too many turn offs
my skin should feel clean at the very least
before purchasing i'd recommend getting a sample if possible to see if it works for you
which could be irritating for some people
it would be three stars if it didn't cost so much
not to mention the fact that i have gone through half the bottle
give it another chance
i still break out often
given the amount needed
never have this kind of problem
i think it's better to offer a choice on the website or just clearly mark that this is for very dry to dry skin
it doesn't help with fine lines at all
i did not research on this at all prior to my use
mistakenly thinking that it was the same like philosophy "help me"
so maybe they are better
i plan to keep using it
being an oil was not particularly good for that
even if i used very little
i know some people say your skin can take some time adjusting to a new product
i am hoping this will provide more impact over time with use
no way, this "oil" was enough.
not so much for combination/seasonal greaseballs like me
find it funny the biggest proponents at the store are those in the 20-30 year old range for whom it's not necessary
decide what the results are from there
i used it for 2 weeks and didn't see any results.
it doesn't make up for lack of results
what my face is use to
apparently the women that tried it have tougher skin that i do
i plan on trying to exchange it for the other kind i use so that my face can go back to normal
too bad, sephora would have been more convinient.
i spend a lot of $$$ at sephora because they are excellent about allowing returns on products we do not like
was hoping i could use something like this before reverting to injectables
each time i get the same results.
was even willing to settle for something admittedly temporary like this
i am not sure if i have truly seen the mpact promised on lines around lips
this is the second agenist product i have tried.
where i most need it.
i don't see any long lasting results although ihave not been using it twice daily
used this product for awhile
that i would give it more of a 3 with other products out there
even 1/2 of what they state
although i wished this could have worked out
i am not at all pleased with the results which are less than minimal
will probably use up all that remains of it
more in the tube than i thought was possible
though this product worked well as a primer it did not give the long term effects that it promised
didn't have the results it promises either
i think for the money i will be returning.....
even though it's like what other reviewers had said
bought this because i couldn't find the on a clear day product which i believe may be discontinued
as others have stated
i've used nearly the whole bottle to make sure
i saw that it was for acne too so that was a plus
wouldn't recommend spending the $40 on this when you can just get the clear days ahead treatment instead
often times too much comes out
i always have to use a treatment to keep from breaking out
i continue to break out when i use it
i would recommend at least trying it because it does have such good reviews
given that i have had much luck with some of the "best" product recommendations from her site
then this may work for you
too much of it can get wasted
i've spent way too much money trying to solve this dilemma
i've tried to be really careful
you would think that for $40 they could package it a little better
returning to other product that works as well for less
i could see that my skin looked newer somehow
i wish i had a choice between the two items
i would have both in my regiment instead of being combined all the time
not sure it's any better for spot treatment than what you can buy at the drugstore for less money
it seemed to work at first which it did
might be my own skin but not too sure.
this product will unfortunately have to be returned because it leaves just too much of an oily
it being the first time i used it
found that when i treated one spot i would breakout right next to the one i was treating
ill admit the next day it was smaller
we will return to her previous brand.
dismissed the reviews that said this was not as good as the old formula
but...they were right!
i started to get break outs which i think could possibly be due to this lotion
did not like at all and will return it.
thus product may have been good had i been able to get past the overpowering scent
i would use it if it was all the i had
i will be returning it get the regular one
not only are you immediately hit by a strong
this is probably great for people who don't have as dry as skin as me
unfortunately that was not the case for me.
i found out through this product that my face already produces a lot of oil so using this product i had a ton of oil on my face
should i be using it more than once.
prefer a mask that is just for under eye that way i can put them on
thought i'd get this one
even though i had a decent night's sleep
not under or around
that was fine for me, but did not perform.
tried this because of the good reviews
these would be great for summer
it seemed like it really worked based off the percent of people who claimed it work upon further reading i found out that it was only tried out on 11 people
had not used it yet
they are not as purple looking as they were before i used it
it actually seemed to be irritating while it was on
this product was not as good as others i've tried
if they were $2, i'd buy a bunch of them.
it might have done well
or at least not enough that i noticed
what a waste of money this turned out to be.
i continued using it in the hopes, but nothing.
to much money was wasted for absolutely no results
while there is a lot of product in the bottle it still is too pricey to be ineffective
it may be worth it for someone else as this bottle lasted forever
frequently change my routine to keep products working for me
i just thought it was a serum like any other
is still breaking out more than usual
this was the only product to keep it under control
so far my skin actually seems to be doing better without it
i think that i will use this product for a week try another for a week
then keep doing that
i think it would be a highly effective product for someone who has fewer acne problems than i do
collectively they all did a good job of getting my acne under control
i might return this.
now i must start looking around to find a replacement
i used it for about 3 months hoping that i'd see the results that so many people have been raving about
i didn't find this product did anything special compared to other oil frees at less cost
no way could i continue to put this on my face
make up don't go on as nicely as they used to
it is making mebreak out
t may be a while
only because of the pump
it did not absorb as quickly as some of other products i have tried
the only benefit is that it did not make me breakout
used too much to return
while i will say this lotion does close them up more than any other pore minimizing product i've used
which is not preferable for a lot of people
have been trying to use it
this product was not what i was expecting at all.
so i will save it for summer.
this product didn't help with oil at all.
thinking that this product would work even better with it
i will be returning this.
now i have to use them all over.
for $130, i expected more..all around!
i expected a lot more
these products are not what they are represented to be
or i would have known better
for now i do not see this product being worth the money
sadly i saw zero results from this product although i used it religiously every night
so points for knowing the approx amount a person will use
i did not see any results that would make me continue to use such an uncomfortable product
with so many other products out there
save you money for something more effective
one pump didnt feel like enough for my entire face
i figured i'd give it another few days hoping it would work its magic
after reading so many reviews about how great this serum was i'm still super disappointed not to mention my skins worse than when i started
was assured it would not be a problem
i only needed one pump of it for my face
i will continue to use it though since i paid so much for it
i would say that it is about as effective as any regular moisturizer
i should get much more from it than i actually did
i knew it would be lighter due to the "oil-free" nature
though i will use it up
i think it would be a good serum to start with however if you have never tried serum's before
do better in my opinion as being such
this serum just did not live up to the claims
a little or some more
today i tried to use it as a body oil
full disclosure: i have not used this on my face yet
very soon after applying it
i did not want to risk it negatively affecting my skin as well
to have it for travel
would be problematic too
the main reason i cannot use it on my face is the smell
when i used this
skip this--there are better oils out there.
just wish i could use in my hair as well
i wanted to try this against josie maran argan oil to see if it had the same results for less money
i didn't feel any difference after using this mask for one month
'll be sticking with that one
this will make it all flare up!
did not even truly fix for more than 12 hours
soon after your face will be feeling the same as before you applied it
it may work for you
i also think it may have broken me out
it did none for my skin
it claimed to be safe for sensitive but no no no.
there are so many good masks out there
this is not one of them
i think many other masks are better
i promise that i have had better results using yogurt
i will never use this again!
figured this would be just as effective
you also have to use a lot on your face each time
after reading the reviews was super hopeful that this would keep me matte for more than 1 hour
so far i like them all
in the evening it seems like i could use more
thought this product would be fine
i think it would work great for most skins.
decided to try something cheaper from caudalie
although i was happy the first time i used it
i've never had any issues with any product from caudalie
it hasn't been as cold a winter as usual so far so maybe if it gets colder it will be more beneficial
decided to try this out as well
i also live in a place that is very dry
super disappointed to find out they test on animals
which maybe was because of the fragrance they put in it
so with all that being said
it might be great for the right skin type
i would give this 5 stars if not for my very sensitive skin
like others have said
way too much money for 1
naturally i was hopeful.
know that in part it must be genetic
i always have hope that some cream out there can at least alleviate the darkness around my eyes
may try it again
never returned any product but this was awful.
aside from the small amount of coverage the tint in it gives you get no other effect on the circles even using it twice a day for more than two months :
more so as i get older
was even more wary of it
it did help a little with fine lines
still trying to find that miracle product.
i did not feel the product absorbed well
that my money would have been better spent on a different product
i hope that product will help
all i can think is maybe for some people they are there due to lack of sleep
they got some rest?
more of a cover up make type product than anything
hoping i'd have something positive to say
the circles are still there even though i used this twice a day every day
i expected to experience something
perhaps i need to try it for 6 months
they are not as drastic as i was hoping for
some days, this product does not work at all.
have to say i have been disappointed
this did not meet my expectations
i tried to use only a little of the product since it's for the small under eye area
it is more like a cover up then something you use under make-up
i should have stuck with that
they actually may be a little better than before
it seemed promising, so i decided to try it out.
thought it would be just the godsend my skin would be needing in the winter
after hearing so many amazing things about this i really expected to be blown away with its effect on my skin
did not like the newer bottle
assured me multiple times that this was the product for the job
i feel so strongly about the way my face reacted to this product that i feel the need to warn others
will definitely be returning it.
i feel this product really needs to be used with the pads for full effect
this may be another product that i am allergic to
this may be the best product in the world for your skin
would suggest trying it despite my experience
hoped this would help with dark spots
i might recommend this to some people since it has fantastic ingredients
this was the only product that wroked
told myself maybe i have to use it a for a few weeks in order to see results
having worked for a company that i know from time to time would go on sites like this for a product that they are repping
thinking to myself if the dates they are posted are too close together
i think as a woman of color though i might need to go through at least two or maybe even three bottles to see some results because of the additional melanin in my skin
have not been able to see any changes in my skin yet
not sure if because the retinol content is not high enough to have any effect
if i see any new result, i will update my post.
even if you have used half the bottle
may work for other people
high end products are a waste of money if you don't see any results
since it is pretty expensive i thought it would work well
i believe a month is a long enough time to start seeing results from any given product
it also did not prevent future break outs as a lot if others said it did
i hope that it just takes more time since i spent so much money on this product
these breakouts are those big hard ones
i might stick with it for another week or 2 to see if my skin will continue to react like this
has not promised the pore clearing results i had hoped for
will be exchanging for something else tomorrow
i've read so many good reviews about it
i find that it works better as a mattifier put on sparingly before make up
it works much better if you use it more like a primer than a mask
i think that can be improve together with the packaging
no product would come out
this means that when i try to pump some new product out
cannot see to track down now
location that i never have
i will probably hold onto this while i continue to look for something more effective
this was recommended by a lot of people
this coupled with the strong smell was enough to convince me that i should return it
it is expected though
so far i haven't been given the results i have been "promised"
i should have researched before buying because as others have stated
but it might work for some!
i should be using something for age defense
there are other products that work just as well.
must just be something not agreeing with me
greasy looking although not terrible which is why i used it at night
although considering the price i may have done myself a favor
the results are inferior to quite a few other moisturizers i have used that are a third to half the price
can only use it at night which is a huge waste
wanted to see if stepping up to a pricier product would deliver serious results
one way or another
this one is not
i ended up not being able to use it on my face
they eye cream by this company is much better choice for the money
the main thing that will prevent me from buying is the smell
is the best way i can describe
every time i go to sephora they have trouble finding products for my skin type
saying it was "all natural" first of all is not the least natural
second just because a product is "all natural" it does not mean its for sensitive skin
while it may work for you it may not work for me.
hope this review helped!
not better or worst than anything i have tried before
i am sure i can pay $50 for something with similar results
look like i had no sleep at all
it might be suitable for a younger 20-something skin
although the product did make my face feel more firm
i wish i had the opportunity to return the product when i could because it was not worth the money whatsoever
if i could leave this message on a more positive note
it is recommended to those who just want to spend money or use for using sake
not only that it did not reduce the dark spot
you can see results fairly quickly after you start using it
i don't see the same results as earlier either.
without the inclusion of alcohol this would have been a totally different review
i will continue using it
be mindful about it.
i wish it could be applied like the other serums
i did not give it the full 30 days in which most experts would say you should try a product for
if i can't see results within another month i may return
which is the sole reason why i wanted this eye cream
i used it for 3 days to see if i get used to it
you only need a very small amount to cover undereyes which is great
it looks like many buyers have suffered the same sting that i did with this
i am finding that i cannot where this product during the day because it causes my eyes to burn so much that i cannot keep them open for hours on end
i used the sephora quiz to help me get the right product for my troubles which this was for my sensitive skin
i tried applying it 2 more times
will not use again.
more often then not
almost every time it would manage to get into my eye
the effects do not last long
it seemed to make everything run
i'd better keep using their face
i would have kept it had it been cheaper.
regardless of how little product i used
that is about it
realized that it was this product that caused it because it was the only thing i was using for that area
not sure about the lifting yet
i feel like it is way too heavy for these skin types
it is not light enough for combination
half of the claims are not true for my skin
unfortunately i was getting a spot or two with every single application
not in the usual places
i would consider it basic at best.
this could be my skin and winter time.
the thing is that i can vouch for it being good for sensitive skin
for this price you might expect a little more added benefit
probably better off if you have normal skin
will still be purchasing other things they make
i could never get my foundation to blend well while wearing it
it didn't absorb very well at all.
thought this line would work
none of their products have
does not absorb quickly, not intensive.
even using only the one pump
this did not last long at all
there must be an ingredient that my skin can't tolerate
it does work well the rest of the year, though.
travel friendly, but not too small!
for those who have incredibly sensitive
i think there are better options than this
even with putting a lot of the product on
pumps are always #1 in my opinion
it may be okay for summer time
has not given me any benefits like brightening that make me want to keep it
however this specific product disappointed me
the only reason i have this product two stars instead of one is the fact that it does brighten the skin
wish the would do a re-package
it might just be me as i am sensitive to orders.
this might work for other people
i know there has to be more product in the jar
too new to see results
as i have used
as soon as we left the cream our skin is clean again :/ so save your money
i did not see any improvements or felt it was worth trying on any longer
ptr has products that are either a hit or miss for my skin
only use this product when i feel like my skin needs a boost
there is no way i could use this product consecutively without a high probability of my skin breaking out
as a booster it was suppose to help with overall even tone
00 i would think it would at least last for a month if not more
with much determination i have been able to get the lotion out
for this reason only i give it 3 stars
even the unwrinkle line seems different
my sister even called me to see if i was having these issues because her new supply was the same way
you will never be able to use all the product because of the way it is designed
it is too expensive to not be able to use it all.
wondering if it is too late to return these
however even after a month of regular use i did not notice any results
given the amount of money that i paid for this product i just feel bad to throw it in a garbage
this is where it belong
unfortunately this product did not work at all on my combination skin
that sometimes when you use a new product
my face actually looks better using nothing at all
this is the third perricone product i have tried
though i feel like i should also get a refund for the time i spent trying to conceal blemishes from using this
i think that may be the only thing that makes me pores look slightly smaller
unwilling to accept that my visible pores are here to stay
she said that this product would work.
though i'll continue to use it since a
it closed them so tightly that nothing could get out
so now i have completely stopped using it :
there's so many better options out there.
i feel there are other clay
that can be fixed by adding a few drops of water
especially when there are better products that won't hurt you at all
i wouldn't recommend it since there are other treatments that can do the same job for a lower price
that could have just been the bone
you could probably find a good exfoliater for a better price
sadly this is not the same product as the original
i didnt see any results
i would not say it helped a lot with fine lines
i used a couple of times in an effort to see if maybe it was just because it was a new product
still have a lot left
the product didn't seem to work even in the least bit
i figured because of how expensive this product was i would give it a fair shot
not many products have had a fantastic outcome for me
was eager to try it
since it didn't absorb well at all
too much thought has to go on to use
be careful not to apply to much product
i think the bottle will last me quite a while
especially for what they charge for it??
the only plus is that it was coming with free gifts
it took forever to absorb as well.
now that i'm older they are getting worse
you have to rub it in which takes more time than it should
as far as helping with spots
so far they have not faded
it's been less than 2 week so we shall see
others in this line
it will be going back.
you will be disappointed
i feel there are better less pricey products that work
all in all i would not purchase this product as it did not improve my skin
for so long i had been dying to try these products
i like to focus on one area to see if the product is really working
i still continued use
eventually i came to the conclusion that less was way more in terms of the oily feel
if i used very little product it felt better on my skin
just as with any product
the product never felt like it fully absorbed into my skin
i used this both with
most people would steer clear though once they see the steep price of it
that in itself can already be a deterrent for some
i regret even more for not returning it
must be because this is not made in the us.
i would never use this product again
i will use the rest of it
not as well with my clarisonic
my expectations for this were pretty high
there are sooo many other worthy cleansers out there which do just as well for the fraction of the cost of this
glad i have a few more uses in this little sample which i will truly enjoy
will continue to see if it clears itself up or gets worse
yet this product is not cheap by any means
used it for a couple weeks i realized that it was meant for someone who wears full makeup
i can see how they would definitely benefit from this product
but the main question remains, does it work?
had to look up exactly how to use it
a plus for those germaphobes out there.
but clearer instructions would be very helpful.
there is no need to reapply
it should have all of the above
there are no instructions on the product packaging so maybe i've used it incorrectly
i feel that every product should have instructions
i'll continue using until it's gone
they appear the same
perhaps it takes longer to see results.
i do think my face is less dry than it had been before use
knew nothing about it or the company
i realized after the initial use that a little goes a long way
so i made sure to just use one pump each time.
i wish i could of reviewed this product in winter though
since for the cost of this product i would of hoped for more
i did not get the results i've hoped for
just different than others i've used
it did make it feel a bit tighter
did not see a difference with a month of use.
i will give it more time.
i could see these results immediately after i put it on
i don't think this cream is necessary especially for all the cost of the products together
i would not have minded only if it worked
definitely test this before you buy if you are at all sensitive to scent
did not absorb very well.
this cream is one of the better ones i have tried
surprised this product was the one they recommended me in store given the poor reviews online
does work to an extent
they were not there before
or i would have stopped using
if it worked it would not have daunted be in the least
get the same results
i've never paid this much for an eye cream
i will keep trying
apparently i do need to spend almost $100 for a good eye cream
where i used this i noticed so many new little break outs
i figured i could use it for spot treatment
so my face wasn't as red as it probably could have been after reading these reviews although i had little clusters of bumps appear on my face after use
none of them have given me bad reactions
maybe i got a bad batch because so many people seem to love it
coming from someone who has struggled with mild acne i would not recommend this product
it just helped clear existing spots a bit quicker
i've always wanted to try the mudmasks from glamglow because everyone talks so good about them
i must say i've used so many mud masks in the past
i still tried it to test it
couldn't wait any longer cause the burning was getting stronger
it may work for some people
used up all of it
just make sure you pay very close attention to the first couple uses when using this mask
works alright that there are much better products on the market
nice as a treat to myself every other month
which is how i will continue to use it avoiding the cheek area
those are literally all the pros of this treatment
you would expect it to be more effective then the cleanser which this is not
no chance in the morning which i was highly mad about since it's claims said it helps with blemishes
can be used as a spot treatment
it also will help fight blemishes way better
am going to use it one more time
come to think of it i didn't use the treatment that much this past week
i also think you get very little product for the cost
maybe it meant for younger people.
if feels light when i apply
as most things tend to do
though it did absorb quickly
that was the same with this product.
this might work for me in the winter
definitely not in the summer
i seem to have issues with origin products always breaking out
nothing seems to work for me from their line
also because my face had enough with winter
lets be honest every time i have put that cream on new breakouts came
i get that there are specific ingredients that make it smell that way
this new formula does not work under make-up for me
not for the better
with this new formula i also have to use a lot more
i'll probably move to the a perfect world moisturizers since i have the rest of the collection
not much better than other things i have tried
if you are only concealing certain areas of your face
didn't last very long
it just didn't help with oil control at all
i wish that anthony's product worked just like it was advertised
the man was very convincing on the fact it could keep me shine free
using this actually made my skin shiny sooner than usual
it does say to apply as needed through the day
what man is going to carry this around
no matter how much oil i applied
my skin looked no different than when i was using it
i've since used other products that work better for me
plus i haven't seen any results with it so waste of money
give it a try since i have combo skin
i used it for a while
while my skin did improve it is very skicky
which is unfortunate since i need the other product
must have tried at least 100 pumps before giving up
i still need it
so perhaps it is more helpful there
was expecting so much more!
just wish a different cream were inside
i am sure i could find somethingas good if not better for at least $10 cheaper
will continue to try them out
they should fade quickly
i will be keeping this
see if it's better in the winter when i might need more
i realized that i am not the only one who gets breaks out from this product
i would suggest you try a sample from the store before you invest in this
it would absorb after a bit but not all the way?
this is not a product to use during the day if you suffer from shine
it can be a good moisturizer at night which is what i will be using it for from now on
that is about it
it took me some time to realize this product was to blame because i started using other new skin care at the same time as i started using this moisturizer
that's what they should state since my face which has large pores
however its not for me
this was a lot more money than i wanted to spend
it's not as effective as i would have liked it to be
giving it three stars because i really wanted it as both a day
feel as i put it on
every time i use it
certainly could use some help with lifting plumping etc
then i will come back to this review
this bottle will not last long!
the bottle is so small it would not have lasted long
to be fair i did not use it long so with continued use i may have felt the benefits
actually going to be returning this
they may want to try to stay away from claims such as that
because it is a pricey product that i will be returning because of no such results in weeks
unfortunately i expected so much more from this eye cream
i've never had a product give me such quick results before
if i continue to see these kinds of results
will use it in this way until i use it up
i wish it would have worked
would have been pleased to use it if it indeed did anything for my skin
i am continuing to use it though because i feel like it will help in the long run
they are only a temporary fix
think philosophy needs to review its ingredients as i see i am not the only person who has had a bad experience
mostly bought this because i wanted to prevent them from getting any worse
this stuff literally made them worse than they have ever been
we also tried it on him
i gave two stars because i do like the very soft
this product either goes bad really quickly or have negative effects on sensitive skin types like mine
if i found another product that made it feel this good without the burning
i can see i'm not the only one who has had this reaction
i am only able to use it about once a week.
that i have decided it isn't worth a full size because it burns far more times than it doesn't
thinking i just needed to adjust to the "miracle" at work
will not be using this product
i did have some
rather than stop using it
will look for similar philosophy products that go for full face
i would suggest getting a sample first to see how it works for your skin
i found this to be such a waste of money.
i did find it reduced fine lines
seem to be in the minority here
i see no results at all
did not lessen the look of fine lines
well i somehow think it may be filling in my fine lines
making it appear to me like i have less fine lines
at the same time, it might actually be working!
am not returning, but would not buy again.
which this product totally failed to do
i would gladly pay $65 for a tiny bottle of eye cream if it provided some benefit
i made the mistake of apply way too much the first time
didn't seem to have any other problems once it was off of my skin
it may not be the best option for those of us with dry
none of them have worked for me
i found it to be a very expensive
as well as a few very old ones
no more than it would have without the product
i regret putting such high hopes into such a useless product
with that being said
although i'm still using this
glad it worked for other people
after buying a few tubes of these i found it really did nothing for my
once i am finished the tube i will likely not repurchase -- it is quite expensive for a product that does not perform well consistently
this is the only product that i have anything negative to say
i'll continue to use until i run out
i've read a lot of other reviews, too.
i'll try to use it more often
for a longer time to see what will happen
if you are pressed for time this is a terrible product for time management
because i think it has mildly helped i will continue to use it
i am only using it once a day at night so that might be the reason
it's not very visible if you are going out fresh faced
if you are adding make up on top then it doesn't work
they might not be as fun to apply
it did do a good job on a couple more prominent scars
it would likely be great for others, though!
neither of them look any better at all.
i expected a lot since it got almost 5 stars review
i went into sephora to try out some foundations to see which one would work for me
t could be fine using a different method
i will continue to use it
which is very important to me when using any skin care product on my face
hope i see some changes soon.
so that might be the answer to my results
this will probably work better for those with dry skin
i plan on continuing to look for something that works with my skin type
i may use this alone
i will be returning.
it might work well for some
i would definitely advise a spot test first
they work much better
try it out before making a big purchase on products that are as $$$ as this one
had hoped this would help address the aging
it did not deliver the results it said.
it might be more difficult to use if you're skin is sensitive
thought this would help
this is my first time to review as i wanted to share my bad experience
will not be using the rest
not really seeing any results yet.
not paying this much for a product that only semi-works for my skin
i will be returning to get something that will lock in more moisture
while it did absorb quickly
got almost 4 months out of it in case you are wondering about how long a jar can last
there are way better moisturizers out there in the $30-$40 category that do a much better job
hope that once i have used it some more i see more of the pore tightening
no matter what i am putting on top
so for that reason alone i will probably not repurchase because i hate having these little balls of makeup
trying to get my skin used to the new product
the reason i have not returned it yet
is because i am seeing some results
there are a lot of cons in my experience so far
i tried waiting longer between applications
hoped this would help
i tried using a couple more times to give it a chance
was hoping that this one would work for my skin as well
i suspect there is a better one out there for me
didn´t see the results i expected
at least not for me.
i would give it zero stars if it was an option.
if anything i got more from using this product
really disappointed that i spent all this money with no results
overall i thought it was a waste of money
no use at all.
otherwise i will totally return it
was happy i was able to return it.
may i need to give it another try due to the price
as others have said
i picked up this one because of what it claims to do
i will try lancome after this is done.
it should do a lot more than that
other algengist products really live up to their claims except for this one
it does not help with dark circles that are caused by genetics
i definitely will not be using this in the daytime
lastly the employees tried to convince me that it would work better after my second bottle
this has to be the worst eye product i've ever used
if anything i may have a few more fine lines now!
which have both worked very well for me
make eyes look older over the course of using the product
may be need more time
this was not an issue
not sure about other reviewers
i barely used it a month so not sure if i had to keep enduring the awful effects before it started to show something different
let alone worked in any of the ways the descriptions say it will
it may work for some but was a big no for me.
other creams at this price point seem to last longer
age them even more
i really had high hopes for this product.
i would wait for it to absorb
i do however have some fine lines
i am going to have to return this
i think i'm just one of the small percentage of people that do not get results
i also use it on other areas of my face
was hoping this serum would both correct
if i see no result
they say you must give eye creams four months to see true results
we will see once i finish with this bottle
this is more for people who have no wrinkles
want to maintain it that way
why some people may like it
compared to many other products i have tried
how can this possibly be an anti aging product when it is so drying
i still prefer the kinerase
will look normal again
will not use again.
if you are in need of intense
this pot would last you a very long time as only a tiny amount is needed for each use
i say several times because i just couldn't believe that i would be having a reaction to a product
products that do an even better job.
i always give a product a try for 3 months
i really had high hopes that this cream would work
could see my under eyes looked worse than they had while using this
wish i could return.
i agree with some of the other reviews saying that this cream doesn't deliver on its promises
that is why i'm giving three stars
i wasn't able to use it long enough to be able to notice a change in my dark circles
i agree with others on this cream.
i will be looking elsewhere
helped with what i needed it for
it only does an average job of that
besides that, this may be a hit or miss for some.
won't be using this any more
it works just as well as any other eye cream.
i would recommend other
some have come with getting older
some is just me being so fair
i feel like this has been one of the best eye treatments i have purchased so far
the only good thing i can say about this product is that it isn't too oil to cause any problems around my eye area
if i was just using it as a moisturizer then it would be fine
try a sample first before buying the product to make sure it works for you
i would have complained about paying $x for the amount you get
as others have stated
as others have stated
giving it two stars because it will last forever
hopefully i will have better luck with that.
will be returning this.
like some other review suggested
i tried this product since i liked most of the other josie maran products so far
way too expensive for these rather bad results.
could not find my receipt
every time i have used this
i want more than just that
now that the winter is here
so at least josie is trying
thought that i might love it as much as the reviews says
either that or seemed like it might work for the first 10 minutes
if lived near a sephora this would be my first product return ever
i think some other more affordable eye creams will be able to provide the same effects
i didn't have this problem to begin with
i expected more from this mask.
i don't find this to help those patches
they put a lot of time
i see other women had the same results.
it was not meant to be
so this review is meant for those
this is not one of those products.
the only pro about this product is that a little
i still have some
it has not done anything to remove or prevent fine lines
i would give -1 if there is such option
the results did not last
i will definitely be sticking to that
i would return them but too late now.
made me look older
that should have been the first sign that this was a bad product for my under eye area
i would not recommend this product if you have sensitive eyes which i found surprising as i have never had these issues with clinique in the past
shisedo or lancome over this any day for actual results
with that being said
it has burned like crazy every time i have tried to use it
so had to stop using it
there was a promotion for clinique products so decided to try this one out
i can't say if that was the cream or recent stress
i would not recommend for those with very sensitive skin
however this moisturizer that is specifically for overnight use has had no such effect on myself
i've only used it once so far
other than that, not much else.
think this must have been it
initially it worked well
still a waste of money since it doesn't work
for this reason i put on another layer or two just in case
there are many better mud masks than this.
it's also an easy job to apply on my face.
however it did not really met my expectations
mask did a better job than this
considering the amount of masks you can get out of it
one pod was more than enough for me
t's always a gamble for me to find a good mask that has lasting results use after use
i am still very sensitive to certain products as my skin will react
for people with more mature skin this would be super beneficial
still not as much product for the money as some other products
as others have said
i hoped it would work on me
from the time i started using this cream i have been getting a lot of acne on my face
on another note all other boscia products i have used i have loved
then one day recently i was like "i should try it again"
it didn't seem to fully absorb
it doesn't go along with any other face products
i'll be bringing it back for something else.
in the beginning it worked well
however once it used with the rest of my routine
will definitely be returning
the smell makes me want to look for a different product after i'm done with this one
this is not one of them
i got this hoping it would be like other boscia products
i always look for the most natural
therefore realized it was this
i tried to get used to this one
i might try it again next winter.
it definitely have less oil than other products
so far it is the highest "oil free" that i found so far
it helped they had boscia reps in the store that day
thought it would be great to try this
t is difficult to find products that work for me without any problems
i feel so let down after she praised the products so much
maybe because i have older
the product itself would have worked perfectly if not for the smell
my face had never been so bad
white or any other kind
this was not as moisturizing for me as i thought it would have
was hoping this product would help with that
no go with this.
that give me the same results
it did not absorb well at all
now my face might just look elsewhere for an oil that best fits instead of this one
i think its important enough to share
you actually get a lot of oil in this for the price
i will be keeping this
drugstore oils do the exact same thing for me at least
both these instances happened to me.
am i the only one having this issue?
i love the product so much that i will continue to use it
can actually use a full bottle for once
is ok but not as hydrating as i had hoped.
no good ones either
you can apply foundation almost immediately
will continue using it a while longer
it think those two were more effective than this one
i decided to use this product alone as a moisturaizer
going to have to return this
the main reason i rated this so poorly was because it took forever to absorb into my skin
the nature republic's oil did a great job in all areas
however i never feel clean using them
so was very hopeful that this was going to solve the redness
'm going to try a different product for a while
this may work great for others!
could just be me
needless to say i will not be using this product at all
i like a lot of their products
every single time i have used it
there are betters out there.
i'd even give it a bonus point for the fact that i only needed a drop to cover my entire face
t had the potential to last long
not at all what i expect from the ingredients in this product
this has to be one of the worst face creams i have ever used
maybe it will be nice in the summer?
there are less expensive cleansers that do the same
even though it is supposed to be good for sensitive skin
i still have some issues w
this had a great review..so i expected a lot.
this however is not
for the colder months i need something more
i will sadly return it though
will defenitely return it to get the money back
that there is no make-up left
which i usually never have
thought that may have been too often based on my skin's reaction
every time i use it
even then it didn't feel the cleanest
i needed a great amount of it to cover my entire face
i will say my skin felt pretty good after each use
i can't afford to use two pumps or it will run out quickly
which will probably be very, very soon.
i needed a moisturizer immediately so that i could move my face
i wanted to love this as it is supposed to be for sensitive skin
unfortunately it will probable be going back
it feels good on my face i will check in with you again in a few weeks
the only reason why i gave it a three is because i haven't had a chance to use it long enough
there are many other face oils out there that work just as well without the horrible smell
i think you'd have to be really committed to it to be worth ordering
if my skin benefits from this product i can get past the smell
i hoped it would be worth it
i don't get all these positive reviews?
i would stay away from this product
that can be done
i can see this working for other people with extremely dry
i hoped that it would soak in
can't comment on what other reviewers are saying regarding that
i think the other ingredients are intended to cover up the smell since they don't really have any benefit
i used it once
might just use the rest of it on my h
i think this would be more suitable for someone who have super dry skin around the eyes
because this is a new prouduct
thought it will work better
i don't see any difference from using a less expensive eye cream to this one
i wanted to keep using it to see if maybe i needed to give it a longer use period
seriously any other eye cream can do that for far less of a price
for the money there are other products that work just as well
it did not seem to absorb quickly
because you can dispense small amounts which is all you need
could not use this
i really hoped this would take care of my under eye bags
i will continue to use it
this may be heaven sent for some users
by for when i want the extra glow
so i had high hopes for this.
but i would not use this product ever again.
the only reason i even checked the website for reviews was because i was worried my skin might peel or burn
i kept using it for awhile hoping i would
the reason for the company pushing that it makes you "glow"
if i'd known that, i never would have used it.
found i had to be very judicious about how much i used -- which kind of defeats the purpose if you're also relying on it as your moisturizer
it sounds like some others have had better experiences
i'd recommend giving it a test run on a day when you don't have to be out in public
even when you think you have it on right it can sometime look darker in some places
so when i saw this product i thought sure it would be a hit
this product was not as good as i thought it would be
went looking specifically for it
would help with my skin concerns
i actually had to take my contacts out mid-day because they were
starting to see some fine lines
read how great c is for both problems
will definitely have to pair it with something heavier for the winter
i used it first thing in the morning because that's when i need the most energy
i can unfortunately only use this as a night cream
may just put it on in areas that aren't prone to breakouts
also not the worst
otherwise it is a waste of time
as i was hoping that this product would help my makeup last longer
thought i'd use this on special occasions
i currently have a breakout that i would never get with any other product i've used
this may have to go back.
i think i'll be switching to a different
i feel like i gave it a chance too because i have used it for 2 months now
this appear to be an ok product
am not too sure about the effectiveness
for close to $100 i would expect actual results.
it did nothing more than that
may take longer use to see any real difference in older skin
it seemed to make them stand out more!
this line did not have any customers to speak of
i did not find the results to be any better than any other nighttime product i have
or even long term
i will continue to use it
when i would use it
these two products used to be the only things that i could find that kept my zits
it was also disappointed to see that they used fragrance in the ingredients list
after reading the reviews it seems like several people have had this same issue
will definitely not be using this product again.
will probably use the rest
yes, but not any better than a drugstore product.
will be returning this product
it may work for others.
if they make a non scented version i might buy it
i've never had a product break me out as much as this did
wish i had a better experience with this product because it was so expensive
there are some other korres products where others find the smell terrible
i assumed that it was an ingredient that i had to get used to or the mask "working its magic" or even the acne toner that i had used a few minutes before
that i was just having a bad skin day
i got the reward and used it immediately.
i'd heard it worked really well from other reviews
this is the first time i felt the need to review something
after i did some research on ouls
i did use most of the bottle
this product was recommended to me in store by sephora employee when i was searching for a new face regime because i'd felt that my previous one could be improved
it might work for others
thought that might be a better way to use the oil
maybe it works well for other skin types
will try again as i have a very oily t-zone
it is such a strong smell that i refused to even put it on my face-- i tested it on my h
i used it in so.
they removed almost all the beneficial ingredients or moved them to the bottom of the list
also made sure that any other serums i was using were dry prior to applying this
did they change the formula on this?
other then that it is good
it will be thick under those
helps my foundation to stay on longer
its not any better than some of the other moisturizers that i have used
all that being said
i also find that
well not even one full day of use
perhaps this was just too much product for my skin right now?
had heard good things about their products
some may like that
especially since it was so expensive
i would expect to see some kind of result
i might give it a try when i'm older.
most likely do to the alcohol
it seemed to be working up to that point.
as soon as i put it on it felt a bit drying only to find out it had alcohol in it as one of the top 5 ingridients
it also broke me out as well which happens rarely
i expected a little more
i recommend the same for all
i am going to be seeing way more scars than this could ever heal :
thought that this could be the answer to all of my acne problems
well i think 3 months is enough time to see results from a product
because like many others have noted
this caused me to break out in places on my face that are normally pretty clear
it might work for other people
now i have to work to get it looking decent again
if it continues i will be returning it
if i didn't have so many wrinkles now i see more
i realized i could have saved quite a bit of money on skincare
then bought a bigger bottle after reading every single review on here thought it would transform my face where i didn't even have to wear makeup
takes away from some of the ingredients that could actually benefit skin
the price point is way too high as well.
continued to use it here
led it with care because of other reviews i read about it breaking easily
no one would ever find out
not sure if i could use this year round without major clogging pores
and i used only a drop or two, so not much.
because i had been trying to build a more chemical-free skin-care routine
super disappointed, but this will be returned.
i ended up returning this product as it just did not fit well for my skin or skin type
this one is a pass, at least for me.
will not be going for round three
how quickly i used it up
i used it once
i would break out after which isnt like me since i do not have sensitive skin
i used it once
it may work for some
still can't imagine spending the high price on this when there are so many better products out there
i didn't find it better than my other go-to products
plus you have to use a lot it seemed like
've never felt the need to use these type of products
how often you should be using it in order to maintain "the glow" you would probably run out in 2/3 weeks
i really hoped this one would deliver
the reviews reassured me that it was worth it
i feel that i could get similar results for far less $
we need to remember that chemicals are cheap
this product i had some high hopes for
maybe with more regular use i would see better results
i could get the same results in less time
for a lot less money
after reading several reviews i'd say my expectations were pretty bang on for this product
not anymore so than it does with the products i use for a fraction of the cost
claims i expected something special
invest in something that may actually have an effect on your skin
i really had high hopes for this product
have been disappointed from the get go
hence the need to use a couple more pumps than is suggested
moreover, the product does not absorb at all.
because as soon as i stopped using it
since is a better product than this
just like all the other skin care products i've tried
although it does say twice a day on the packaging
i hope it works for other people with different skin types
once a week would probably be fine for my super sensitive skin
i felt it wasn't no different than any other cleanser
they should make this scent in a misf
probably people who have normal skin will like this product
i felt like i needed 2-3 pumps at minimum
which didn't make the product last very long
there are better products for a lot less that do more for your money
the first time i used it i had to pump about 5-6 times to get a decent amount of product
i decided to use less.
i used it for about 2
i never really got the same result as that first time
you need to use a lot of product to get a good result
they would have a better pump
there are cheaper products that do just as good of a job or better at cleansing
your skin looks the exact same after using it
there needs to be a cleanser in between the biggest
i doubt i'll be back for more
i can say for $38 i expected a much better pump.
not encouraged to try any of their other stuff based upon this face wash
said although it is somewhat expensive
i need a good seven or eight to feel like i get my whole face covered
this is gentle enough to use daily if i chose to
might work if you are under 30.
i might have to bring it back.
i would tolerate any scent if it meant i had good results"
have been using it everyday
i am into all natural products because they have just been working great on my skin
i am not suggesting this overall
i will never use it again!
would never buy bases solely on the smell
used it at night only even though it said to apply am
unfortunately i have to agree that the scent is very strong
i may as well stick with my regular routine which i am now
it's still almost as strong as it was when i applied it to my face
the only thing it did was cooling.
it also doesn't seem to work as well for me.
i am going to use this up though.
i really thought i could benefit from this
they say instant results..no way!
not only did it not help my under-eye bags
these do not help at all waste of money
or worked with them
as others have stated
unfortunately did not work for me regarding depuffing my under eye bags
thought i'd give this a try as well
because of this product i now have mild breakouts on my face that would have been worse if not for the rest of my skincare routine
i know this was the cause because everything else in my routine has been in rotation for a while now
i ordered this cleanser because it claimed to do everything i had ever hoped for
other than that this alluminater is true to its word
i wanted to like this in hopes of it working.
this is how they claim it to be brightening?!
i assumed it would be really good
even if i apply a little amount
may not be best for combination skin.
that all being said
i now use hope in a jar
may be good for others
this is the best oil, and i have tried so many.
may work better in the summer
still love every other algenist product though
but i will not be replenishing this.
i'll probably keep getting the samples as long as they're available
there is no way to hide these either.
i will not use again
sadly, i will be returning this.
never saw any benefit to my skin even after continuing use
have been trying it
i will say it left it as soft
so does quite a few much cheaper products
it is just so not worth such a high price for a common type oil made by many different br
i am especially disappointed in the price i paid for something that had absolutely no effect on my skin
this might be my 4th bottle now
so maybe at the beginning it was something "special"
i still have all of the above after using this product
i think this works for many people
see how you feel before investing in this as there are many similar more gentler products out there
someone told me i need to go through at least 2 bottles to see the effect
i seem to be getting a better result from the moisturizer i put on on top of this
perhaps there are people who do find it helpful
i expected this product to be as amazing as all of the reviews said
that was not the case.
t was very difficult to use after that
can't say much about anti aging benefits since i am only 21
i would do one or two pumps of product
thought would be perfect before foundation
so to start i'll take the usual approach
now they are gone
there are way better products out there
it does make double wear foundation application much easier
way to expensive for just that.
i found that every time i used this i would always break out
it didnt absorve quickly at all
i'll continue trying it for a few days to see if i change my mind
it is supposed to be light weight
it is not easy to be absorbed
i'll give it a little more time
maybe 2-3 more uses left
however, it doesnt work well on my skin.
some people enjoy this
it still does after using this product
i would never pay more than $20 for this
i did not see anything out of the ordinary after using regularly for 1-2 months
will be switching to something else.
why i'm still trying this product
i think i have more lines now than when i started using it
not only does it not provide the results advertised
this product had so many good reviews plus its says it gets rid of fine lines
it did not work well for me as it made the dark circles under my eyes appear even more prominent :
it did seem to blend in quickly though.
at first i was excited to try this product because it claims to be safe for sensitive skin like mine
although sometimes i switch over
i really hope that by the end of my new jar i could really see some results
i didn't have any problems with burning like some people said they did
have used up probably 80%
which is rare for me since the only eye product i have managed to stick with was a $190 item from a certain luxury br
i stuck with this product for a while thinking it might do some good
not sure who would want this all around their eye?
i think my routine prior to this served me better
probably this is just my personal problem using the product
at least not for me
i need something stronger
at least lighten the circles by 50% would be fine
i used it all up
after applying i could feel the area tighten
make them look less tired
not really in the "lifting" field as it claims to do
as a face make it wasn’t any better
i just had to because i would recommend this product to anyone who struggles with acne
i find that twice a day is too much
this was not it.
so on top of paying more i have to wash twice thereby using more
my guess is this company is now being run by trump
i would give it negative stars or just no stars
i like the fact that you can also use this as a mask
now it doesn't seem to clean as well as it used to
wish they would offer the original cleanser again
i tried to use this as much as possible
was told by multiple people that this would work wonders for me
l have no results at all to show
so far its seems to help
that was not even the worse part.
may have finally found the one product
i can't comment on the effectiveness of the product because i only had it for 2-3 weeks
decided to give this one a shot because it was a little cheaper
it has gotten better with continued use
it is still there
i will most likely spend the extra $$ for the algenist
way too many great micellar waters out there to spend this much money on one that has no added benefits
this is not one of them
i really don't feel that is any better than other micellar waters that i have tried that are much cheaper
not a bad product by any means
unlike a lot of other make up removing product
cause in that regard it works just d
i did not use it for very long
for how expensive this is i was expecting it to be super effective
was not able to clean the eye make up at all.
not too much more
so now i have this product
if i had no purpose for it then it would have received one star
i found a way to make it work
would of liked to have a pump on it.
it also goes way too quickly for the price.
but it is not good for make-up removal.
now that i've bought it i feel like i still need to wash my face after using it
so not all products work for me
i will never use this again!!
it did not work as well as she said it would
it created a stingy feeling throughout my face- will be returning due to that
i usually end up having to use another product to remove what this product failed to do
it used to be amazing in that it could cleanse
wanted to see how this compared
has nothing to do with fresh
it is less than $40
can use it as much/often
i can leave it on longer
nothing special about it at all.
since i have every mask under the sun i was not so very impressed with this product for the price
you could probably find something of equal value that works better
but this one... not so much.
even after a few tries i remain disappointed
have yet to give that a try
perhaps it works better for other skin types.
this product did not absorb at all
way more than usual
so the lady at the counter suggested that i should try the lotion version instead
within a week of switching to something else
may work for other skin types
since i have dry skin i thought this would work even better
i will be returning
i used it once
realized that none of their products besides the take the day off oil works
i looked at the ingredients to figure out why this may be
their other products do not contain this.
would be good for someone who needs intense hydration
i found it did very little.
as others have claimed
i still use it sometimes
i would rather spend more money on something better next time
was not worth keeping at all
i brought this product because i saw a review online saying this can make your eyes look brighter
this is probably my least favorite of any collection
maybe that will work better
the only positive thing i can mention about this item is it seems to get absorbed really quickly
as i used it once
it probably works for others
i should have done so.
not bad but not sure about its benefits.
the problem i find with most eye creme is that they take while to get absorbed
it'd be best for younger skin
i kept using it to hopefully see some more results
even when i continue to use the product
not sure if i could since 50% of the bottle is gone
the reason i keep using it is because i spent quite amount of money on it
i initially wanted to try out the other product
whether or not it is effective
i will start by saying the positives of this product
usually when i read these reviews
that has never happen before with any other product
i just have putting too many products on my face
this was not it
may save it for winter time
this was a no for me
as other people have mentioned
this is not a product to be used alone
not just that go to all in one product
was surprised at how poorly it absorbed
it might be ok for overnight
i think it would be too much for the summer
i would have given 4 stars if it wasn't for the scent
i normally do not get breakouts these days
t must be the culprit
at first the concentrate seemed to do its job right by really smoothing the skin
you would it be quickly absorbed, right?
both products are going back.
this will have to go back for sure
honest try for 3 months
when they replaced it with this i thought i'd try it
recently i needed something to address the small breakouts i had been getting consistently
seeing my skin getting worse each time i applied them
these will either work for you fantastically or completely destroy your skin during the duration of using them
it can take longer
it takes more time with others.
then this will probably work
have only used it once
i felt it was necessary since majority of the reviews make you worried your face is going to burn off
i forced myself to keep using these hoping the burning would lessen
i actually broke out more--which may have been the purging process--
definitely can see results after the first pad
these did indeed sting.
tried these pads just in that area
they were very strong
i would not recommend this product at all.
they burned so bad when i used them that i only used them for 6 days
never used them again
these were a total waste of money.
that i would have results with enough time
believe they did help both clear up acne
this product may work winners for some
after just a few users i had to stop because the itching was too much to h
i usually can put up with quite a bit
these pads didn't work so well for me.
at first this product might make you breakout even more so as it bringing everything to the surface
still persisting they aren't lasting as long
told that they would act to reduce marks left by past acne as well as reduce future breakouts
may work for some but did not work for me.
i used it religiously until all the pads were done
i will not be returning this product
rarely reach for it
also use it on my feet- hopefully that helps balance out the disappointment from using it as a facial mask
i guess that says a lot about this product already
does not penetrate through skin as well as i had hoped
i will use it up
i would qualify this as a "i have a birthday coming up" product
there's others that do just as good for a fraction of the cost
have been wanting to try a balm for a while
beads or whatever they are called
i also found that i still had tons of makeup on my face
there are so many other options that also remove makeup
honestly surprised more people have not had this reaction
it worked about as well as anything else i have tried
i would never recommend this product based off the smell alone
only have to apply to face
so all in all i wish i had not purchased it or at least got a sample first
it couldn't get rid of all my face make up by only using this product
i tried using it many different ways
i feel obligated to share what a terrible breakout this eve lom cleanser caused me so that similar people with sensitive or acne-prone skin do not suffer the same issues
several products that do a better
it does the exact same job as this
is hard to apply over a large area or to work into the skin
so when i used it
extremely overpriced mask i have ever come across
how that would help skin?
actually one of the best i've had in a while
no matter what time of the day i could never get used to the scent
i will stay away from that one, no doubt!
i've heard so many good things about this cleanser
will be returning this product.
thus does not work well for me
would not use again
this cleanser is not what i expected it to be.
i can only use it in the morning since it doesn't remove all of my makeup in the evening so personally it was not a good investment for me since there are many other gentle/morning cleansers that are equally or more effective for a much more affordable price
which may be the reason it didn't work for me because i am sensitive to fragrance
trying to get the product out what a mission !
this may be a good night cream
too bad i had such high hopes for this night cream
this is the worst cream that i have ever used.
meaning i show wrinkles easier than others
wanted to get proactive about my skin
had to be careful about what i used
i bet that will come with continued use.
never was able to use the product because the pump was faulty
i will keep using because the directions say changes are noticed after 4 weeks
the only way to see if there is more is to bust the thing open
i will likely continue to use clinique until i try a few new products from dr
i hope this one is a keeper since i've try 3 different products had to return
so will keep and hope my skin get better.
will try returning product.
good reviews that it would work
i hoped that meant it was working
suffered for one whole week to see if it'd help
i don't know if the formula is better or more potent in their samples
i do not have sensitive skin at all
which i use on my face with no problem
i didn't get a chance to use for longer than a week because this stung my eyes
can actually do more harm than good at 47
most of them don't offer enough to make it worth the few extra minutes it takes to apply in the morning
it hasn't done anything for me other than provide some hydration under the eyes
this would have been a 5 star review
i need way more moisture than this during most parts of the year
it will make it white where you apply it
doesn't absorb as quickly as i would like
it will absorb in well
she said it would get rid of them
was not able to return or exchange for something else
it has a very different scent from most lancome products that i never liked
when i try products like this i generally take before
have been on the quest to find the best product for it
did not help reduce the look of current spots
i used the product very faithfully for what i would consider to be plenty of time to see some sort of results
if there were any
just didn't expect that it would in fact create new ones
this just was a total fail
ts effects may have been totally wasted on me
at least not on my fair skin
maybe it will work on older skin.
it might have been just time that got rid of it
did not see results i was seeking.
she said may ruin product
which i would give 6 stars out of 5
even though i was instructed by beauty experts at 2 different places to apply it that way
the small amount i'm applying is still too much product
the extra star is because i'm giving the product the benefit of the doubt to work through the 3 large samples i have of it
or how much i had to begin with
when this product came out i was very excited to try it because i read such great reviews online here that people noticed a difference within at least 2 weeks of usage
*sigh* i really wish this product could have done better as a whole
i gave this product a real try — i put other products on hold
it is way too expensive for it not to deliver in all areas that it promised
was pleased to find one that had such great reviews
as far as i can see
thought i would be safe
i think their products are really good quality
i also seem to break out less.
it should be more like $50.00.
thought using something more pricey might be required
at this point i'm no longer hopeful
if i could give this zero stars i would especially since it claims it is gentle enough for sensitive skin
since i have very
while i haven't actually tried the product
i loved this product when i used to order it straight from murad in a package deal
finally i cancelled the shipments because i wasn't using them as quickly as they were coming
i seriously could not get past the smell
i tried to use less
really well for me to order it again
am thinking this is the only product in the line that has it in ingredients
it was pretty much the same as all the other night creams i've used
although this isn't the case with many of the reviews
... i was hoping for.
maybe more suited for someone older.
wish i could return it as well!
expected much more from this product.
it would be nice for someone to come out with a renewing cleansing product for someone with combination skin
i never got to see the product in action around my period because i had so many more backheads
no go for me, but may be better for others.
then i used this
however i do not think i will be purchasing the full size as it is very expensive for basically a very basic moisturizing mask
it may have been irritated because i was trying lots of new face makeup
i do not have sensitive skin at all.
really most of it is gone because of healthier-eating
there are better masks out there
i can get the same results with something cheaper
while you get a lot of product
i found that it didn't give me any better results than a regular old moisturizer
there are other hydrating masks out there that are much much more effective than this one
product did not do much for me after several attempts
was able to get several uses out
would definitely not suggest paying for this.
i can say without hesitation that this is definitely my least favorite of the three
for me it felt just like other reviewers have said
would only recommend for those that are fond of gentle
not so much that this is a must-have product
i hoped this product would a
it has done neither.
my face is seriously worse since using this product
i do not have sensitive skin by any means
unfortunately i'll probably be returning this product
was hoping this would be too
but i feel that it works well otherwise.
not the best, not the worst.
i cnanot knock it since it was not meant for my skin type
this would be a total mess.
i did not get the same results as others
there are better products for me out there
definitely less expensive ones
will definitely try more of her line
i think it might be good for a younger person who has slightly oily skin
there have been so many positive reviews about
:(), but i had to find something new.
it is very hard to only get out a small amount of product
therefore it should be less money because of this
this will be my first sephora return.
i did not have the same experience.
i feel like some of it is being wasted in the leak
it is impossible to use only that much
i would end up using 5 or 10 times that much
i always feel like people are dramatic
even when there is plenty left
that will be the only time ii'll try it again in future
the only issue is i do not use that much product
that said it could just be me
the full ingredients are not shown here on sephora
so this gets three stars because it could have been good
if they had just made it fragrance free
might continue using this until i finish
i kept using it because i really wanted it to work since i paid so much for it
especially because there are some amazing br
thought it can't be that much different than my usual br
a product this costly should be better
for $90.00, this should have worked better.
t's not like i was using to much
the breakouts have not yet fully cleared
i could even apply it around my eyes
a different sales associate spoke down to me as if was my fault for buying a cream that wasn't meant for "young skin
i generally want to like shiseido since it was the first br
tight even though it is supposed to be gentle
i do not see how it can be so "gentle" when the exfoliations beads in it are quite hard
i may have a small cluster here or there
i will be switching it for my lancôme again.
i still use it.
i love it, but will be returning it after 2 uses.
this is has left me wondering what exactly have i been putting on my face for so long
actually did more damage then good
however i'll try it again.
hopefully help even it out
especially having had good experience with the shiseido line in the past
just could not continue
as soon as i put it on
it says its for all skin types but its not.
this went on very thick even though i used a small amount
this must be a product for those who have seriously dry skin
it did not see any benefits it promised such as anti-aging
the other products in the set were much more worth it
there are better products at half the cost
it may work for some
best cream i've tried so far
i feel it is not wise to use this during the day when you are going to be worried about an oily face
will be giving this away.
this was one if them
no way would i spend 150 on the serum
really think of how much the markup is on all these products
it probably would absorb just fine
you are given a generous amount, which is good.
no such luck as of yet
will use it just because i spent the money on it
but unfortunately it was not.
i think for some skin types this would be great
no such luck in that department
this has definitely been a waste of money
i wish i would have spent it on argan oil or something more beneficial for my skin
i knew that the only way i'd be willing to spend the money was if it really worked
the staff at sephora were great
this seemed to make them worse...
i must be one of the few people that dr
but, when i actually used it....
because it does take time to follow directions
this is the only one that i have found that i can use
i should surely find something in the high end market that would work wonders
which i thought seemed like a bit too much at the time
don't usually have the need for too much product
i buy this primer very often because i used my nuface at least twice a week
i wish i could pinpoint the exact scent
did to keep it on long enough to get the full effect
never got so many compliments on my skin before or since
the one star is simply because i could not use it again sadly
have never had such a bad reaction with a product
was disappointed to find that there is glitter in the formula
wasting a lot of my product
there are less expensive products that are just as good
then we are excpected to live longer
the fact that this hits the air as soon as you use
i am not sure how its possible for the ingredeints to remin active???
especially for the money
they seem to work with well together
as i'm in my 30's now
which i only ever use on the very rare occasion i use some make up
all my other products felt like they weren't really absorbing
it is still there like i never remove it
i am sure it is probably great for some people
however, it did not work well with my skin.
this may be great for some
how it made my skin feel at first
which is not in any way typical for my skin
perhaps this would be better suited for those who use very little product on their face
i think this one must be better for some skin types more than others
it might be better for travel
as soon as i stopped using this product
i will stick with the green boscia for sure
i like it so much that i'd test in store to see if that really is the case
you might as well just use water.
it didn't give me any results that were better
i used this both with
i would always wake up with new breakouts
not all of their products agree with my skin
i could not find a position comfortable enough while trying to keep my face off of all of my pillows
it is not well suited for overnight wear
long story short i expected to discover a new staple in my night time routine when i applied it for the first time because it seemed like it would extremely moisturizing
this was the only new product i had used
will probably explore other options once it's used up
i may have had too high expectations because i love boscia so much
i will try it a few more times
so while this worked on those areas
while it did that
have to use this on nights i am not doing anything other than washing my face
i'll keep using because i have it
had it worked well i would tolerate it
i know that may be a short time to grade the effects of this cream
which is the reason i gave it a try
no better than many other products out there
i rarely return things unless they are faulty however i returned this
as others have said
i actually prefer more of a 'glow' though
will try a different one next time
i used it twice a day like it said.
which is so-so
i would advise you to be cautious
although even for that one
still trying as it is a large bottle
i've yet to see them lighten up
i will be throwing this product out
i actually started using another eye make up product at the same time as this so did not realize till later that it was this cream that burned my eyes
it didn't help with my circles at all
'm able to apply it generously a few times a day
it does absorb quickly as a plus
am always looking to reduce or at least minimize them
that seems to be about all that it does
without success so far
i don't know which ingredient is responsible because nothing stood out in the list as burny
the only reason i'm giving it two stars
this is the first product that i've found that i feel i'll finish before purchasing something else
just not so sure about its dark circle treatment yet
unfortunately i had to return it
gel's tend to be too light
i used it everyday until it was gone
that is the only way to describe it.
i never really saw the perks to using the product
have always looked young
when i would use this product i would wake up with breakouts on my combination skin in areas i normally don't breakout
have used them for a long time
i will keep searching.
if it had a better scent i would give it 4 stars.
it worked only as a "normal" moisturizer- which i could purchase at a much lesser cost
this one was not for me
i am surprised at the positive reviews as this was such a waste of money for such a bad product
i still have a lot left
the product did not work well for my skin
firming cream so thought i would give this a try
this did not absorb quickly
just be aware that the fragrance is strong (why?)
this may be a great cream
i may try this again at some point
it isn't any better than before
actually encouraged me to use it faithfully at night
no one will have the same response to anything we apply to our skin
is the best one out of all the algenist ones i have tried so far
t makes it seem as there is a lot of product in it
unfortunately it did the opposite of the promises on the label
although i had none of the problems some other reviewers had
i tried it many times even as a spot treatment.
no desire to even finish the bottle.
it could be a good product.
i wish it was more potent
i also found it difficult to spread the product on my face
by the opinion that for someone with the right skin-type
the next day my skin did look slightly better
decided to purchase considering everyone had had a good experience with it
that was what i did first time applying it
there are better masks out there
i will continue to use this product because it's entertining
hopefully i will see some results soon.
that i had really high hopes for it
by the 4 or 5 time i used it
pick those off individually
have been trying everything
did noting in the long run
you can definitely find much better masks for a lower price
this one is the first from them that is a big miss for me
i would imagine that if this were a regular clay mask
it would work much better
glad others are getting good results
i used it for while
i just find it overall nothing too special for the price
i find myself reaching for another product to address those issues
good for those who just want to wash there face
i would recommend this for normal
i think for people who have skin that requires a stronger agent to keep acne away they should probably not consider this product
a half now i find that it didnt help at all
over the last few days i have been trying to figure out why in the heck was my skin so dry
otherwise not the best
it left much to be desired
this one is no different
the cap on each one doesn't close properly
or need to travel with it
i used a good majority of it
way bigger than usual.
probably not the best sleeping mask out there.
i purposely bought this product so my skin could look brighter
but for this product, almost nothing.
hoping that consistent use of this product will wipe it all off :
as much as other people love it
whatever remaining product has been sitting in my medicine cabinet collecting dust for some time now being that i saw no improvement
this product is not enough to help with winter skin
i've got to agree with several of the other reviews here
there are better products.
it might be natural
definitely suggest that you try one of them out before buying the whole set
i felt like the benefits were minimal for the price
on results alone i would've given this a 4 or 5
those are less important to me because it is a night treatment
i'd still recommend it for anyone with normal skin
have not used it since
i did not have any immediate results the first 3 times i used it
these were very different than the typical acne i am used to
the salesperson said that i can use this every day which i have been doing for a week
i would tolerate it if the product worked
i barely sleep so that could be the issue as well
i feel like using nothing would be better than this
for its price would have liked for it to do much more
the only good thing i can say to its favor is that it applies well
which i never have
if money was no object
i need it to be something more
we typically are more genetically prone to having difficult under eyes
with all the great ingredients in this product i did think it would work
i didn't have them to begin with
will not be using any products on my face again
see if there are any results when i finish this jar up
i don't know who this cream works on as the reviews have no age showing
i didn't originally have a big problem with bags
now they are more pronounced
i kept thinking that eventually things would turn
this product did none of those things it claimed
it accomplished none of these
i hoped that i would figure it out application wise or that my body would get used to it
could not even try because they burned so badly
would have been nice to alleviate some of the burning
try to be careful with which products i choose
which i don't like as much as the previous formula
i wish fresh would continue making the cream
did the same job in a more effective way
however, i could not even finish the sample.
it would work given time
so maybe this is meant for a 15 yr old with no need for eye cream
if it were in a pump i'd give it five
i found it could separate out sometimes.
had it on for about 20 min to see if it would absorb
this is not a product that i must have
it would be great for those who have very dry or mature skin
so do other products without the disappointments
could just focus on enjoying the product
still didn't feel i could disperse enough to reach all areas of my face
i feel it would be best for overnight use if excessive oil is an issue
which leads me to believe its not easily absorbed in the skin
after trying a sample i can see how this product might benefit people with really dry skin
i may have put too much on
i notice lots of other people are having this problem
i never give any review about products i got from sephora
i believe in my products which i have been using for long time
when i applied it for the first time it was really hard to work into the skin
i will continue to give this product a chance
hopefully see some benefits since i had high hopes for this product
there were many claims in the description box that you would see results after one use
you should think twice or at least try the regular size product at the store
i should have retuned
it didn't perform as well as i'd hoped
just can't justify the price when there are so many other ones out there for less
even though it was mild i hated it too much to leave it on my face
you feel extremely aware that you have product on your face
she suggested it could be used as a sleeping mask
which is how i'd planned to use it
i couldn't keep it on long enough for it to be effective
some people may like that
i only applied this where i needed it
saw a lot of people with the same type of skin as mine were using it
i do not have sensitive skin at all
so do many other products at a better price
try one of the other ones as you'll be happier with the results
i think that in this price range there are many other masks that are actually effective
was iffy about it as a mask as i do not normally use them
very steep for what you are getting
wish i had realized that before i used it
i expected so much more
it does not absorb well at all
i will be using it as a nightcream only
does not absorb well at all
acted like i should have known to only use it on my neck
my skin does seem to be worse than before using the product
my skin is on the normal/dry side right now so this should have been a perfect match
very sad unfortunately the negative reviews keep getting deleted after 24 hours that is very deceiving for potential customers
will continue to use it in the hopes that some of it may be absorbing
i tried it several ways- right after cleansing with my clarisonic
i see that i'm not the only one that experienced this based on a review below
i wanted to fall in love with this like i did with most of their other products
i do see results from other products in the amount of time i've been using this one
this one for some reason makes my eye to water
i will keep using it for the rest of my life
i expected so much from this line.
if you use medium to heavy make-up this is not for you
there are way better micellar waters out there.
rep said since sephora doesn't carry this lines toner that i should try this instead since it's a 3in1
it almost seemed like it made my face more sensitive with continued use
this product was recommended to me by a sephora employee because it's supposed to be good for sensitive skin
it removed make up fairly well
this would probably be great for someone with non-sensitive skin
this is not my favorite product by any means.
since i have it now i might as well finish the little bottle
so many negatives for me
will leak everywhere if you use this for travel
i didn't see any added benefit of using this for getting my make up off rather than using my go to baby pil or coconut oil
so was this one although this was better then the soy one
the fact that that i could use it to remove eye
my longwear foundation before going in with a cleanser so when i was recommended this i was pretty excited to hear that it should do both jobs
not realizing it was a different product
i've never had so many zits at one time in my entire life
but this product is just so bad that i had to.
i continue to try different products that make claims
still on fence on rather i will return it.
this product was a no-go for me
for the amount of product you are getting
s will come out with something similar so that i can hopefully find something to help with the lines
is actually best used over foundation
i decided to give this a try as i am so self conscious of fine lines
i tried several times to apply it directly from the tube
its not something id use everyday since there isnt very much product in the tube
i would buy it again since i do like to use it for special occasions
thought this would be the perfect product for use just under my eyes however it did absolutely nothing
try to make them look smaller
but it just was not the case.
i really should have read more reviews on this product before purchasing
that gives me the same result as this product.
figured it must work well
i can do this with other makeup that i have
take the amount you picture being there
not only is there barely any product for the money
not nearly as much as i was hoping
which meant i had to keep going over the area a lot
in my opinion this is probably one of the very few "fails" i've found from nars
the stick was so hard to apply.
i couldn't use this one longer than a week
i wish someone on here had given a better review as to why this product did not work out for them
an associate thought it was a good idea to recommend this product even though i am clearly oily
problem was highlighted more than if i didn't use it
foundation doesn't stay well over this product
this is a very small amount of product for a lot of money
it doesn't work any better than any other spackles" or fillers i have used
i've gotten way more product from
almost to the point that i felt that it was difficult for my foundation to stay put if that makes any sense
foundation did not go on as smooth as with my previous br
it could be that my foundation's ingredients don't mix well with the lancome visionnaire
you may have better luck than i did
it does not perform as well as the sample
not any better than benefit's porefessional
one of similar name that is so much better
i'll have to say no on this especially with the high price tag
they said this would work
still not sure if this ones worth the expense
i give it two stars for being so very overpriced for the benefit/payoff that you actually get in return for the money
i really wanted to fall in love with this because after reading the description this seemed like a possible holy grail product for my skin type
it should kind of do more than that for the price
there products have been a key reason of why i have "dared to go bare"
i do believe that you can only see real result after months of application
this product is not moisturing at all
i will be returning.
they said i could only take it back to the store because of it being outside of 60 days
there is not a store that is convenient to me
it's not as heavy as i hoped
looks like i will be sticking to the other version because it lasts much longer than this
this would probably be great for you
might be good for summer.
i felt like it was not that easy to spread around the face
would probably be great for a teenager or a 20 something
this product should be reserved for the young.
felt like i had to keep using more
amount you get in the bottle because of how much i was using in a day
i would not recommend this product at all.
for the price it did not last that long since i had to use so much
i know that lots of other creams are more expensive than this one
was hoping that this would be a less expensive alternative
as i think it does as much as more expensive br
i feel like i need to use a lot more to spread it around my face
have actually stopped using it for day because the formula is just so average
not even clean at all
i see no results once so ever.
i've never gotten around to trying those
i expected so much more from this product.
but this is it.
both times my skin did not react fairly
i may be too sensitive for it.
it was no different than a similar product i have tried that was much cheaper
this one was a no go for me
from now on i would never trust this br
i too wonder if these reviews are fake!
a lot of masks do that after exposure to the air--hardly a worthy selling point
after trying it a few times i did not feel like it was worth the money
given all of that, i opted to return it.
my products need to last longer since they are not used every day
the only positive thing i can say is that it did not cause my highly reactive skin to break out
that gave me results i could see
feel after one use
the results are ok
i think there are better options than this one.
however i have not been that fortunate.
however i had a really bad experience with this line
especially given how pricey it is
for the price you pay for the product it should be able to do it's job without the help of another product
could be i got a bad bottle or could be i developed a skin reaction
thought this would be a great addition to the peel process
i will be returning this product
assumed the rest of the line would be just as great
i see no difference at all from before using it
perhaps i haven't been using it long enough.
so far i've used about 1/3 of the bottle
it is too expensive to not see any benefits
i will be returning
as a base -don't expect this to be all you will need
yes it is technically more work
it might work great for others
this just can't follow through on its claims
at first i wondered if it would absorb into my skin more
i think that the cool metal was what helped rather than the actual product
she applied what seemed to be a lot of product.
the results were the same
then it settled into under eye lines that you couldn't really tell were there otherwise
thought this product would be perfect
bought this product because of what it claim it could do
they were still there
even just having this on alone
every time i use it
even more tired than i did before i applied it
this product doesn't do either of those jobs properly
this just wasn't that different
might take a little longer to see the results
i like it more than any of the glamglow ones
may buy again in the future if i know it won't take me a year to get through it with the rotation of my current masks
because it was in a box set can't do much about it because i like the other items in it
there are much better masks out there for a fraction of the price
a lot of product is needed in order to see results
it did not deliver on either counts
might work better on younger combination skin type
try use it both day
this is one of those products that seems great on paper
hope to see better results
this is the kind of product that will last most people longer than its shelf life even at the 0
have it fresh for longer than have to pay more for more product than i can actually use over the course of 1 year
i know there are lots of beneficial ingredients here
give two stars because it didn't cause any damage to my skin
i find it difficult to use
my skin seems to be the same as it was before i used it
i would have given it 1-star except i really like the packaging
there were a few things i didn't like about this product
this one needs to be returned
there is no way that the cloth would cover an entire face
this is my least favorite of them all
would suggest passing on this
i expected much better results.
they say the cucumber one is better
with make up or without make up
i still would use it if i could st
of course this is only my opinion.
maybe gave useful it 3 times
i see no 'repairing' effects as the product promised
have never had this happen with a mask before.
had really high hopes for this
will be returning it :
it was better than nothing
i could get the same results with much cheaper products
i will have to start using proactive again
most of the other negative reviews that were up were deleted
some people have the same reaction
if my skin would not have reacted the way it did i would most definitely keep using this product
i could not figure out which of my products was to blame
i did not for one second suspect that it was the mask because of it's consistency
she used this once
this has never happened to me with any other skincare product
i hope this helps someone out there in the same situation
a reaction to a product doesnt only have to be on the area you apply it
the product was far far far far far too strong for my face
i realize these are made up words
i didn't notice many benefits from it
perhaps the take away is that if you have fairly low maintenance skin needs stay away from ptr
i want to switch between that
i don't care how many different rose essential oils they claim are in the product it wasn't useful to me at all
this should only be used once a week if your skin can withst
so be careful not to use too much
will write back with another true review once i notice any changes
have never reacted to something at all
they worked with me to find another product which so far is working well
i also had a reaction that many others had with this makeup
i just now read on the perricone website that they are coming out with new shades of the serum
definitely did have to use more than the recommended '2-3 drops' even using as very light coverage
this should say, only for fair skin!
i just even had to get some perfume on my face to feel comfortable to sit next to other people
this was not what i expected it to be.
other than that i wasn't a good fit for me
i will keep both
this was supposed to be for great coverage for aging skin
did not deliver at all
powder that worked great with other color correcting products haven't worked well with this one for me
yet to find one that can keep the color staying put
this would be for those lucky girls
this will be used as a primer from now on.
i hope they make it in light
as they did with the no foundation foundation
that can also be "a little shiny
i did try it more than once
without looking like i had too much makeup on
i want to use this all year round.
if i had been aware of the information i know now
for $55 i expect more.
because i wanted to try a few products in the line
you might want to spot-test this in the store first
because if i'd be angry if i'd spent nearly $50 on such lousy product
have been able to get away with using anything on it before
only had this in a sample if that matters.
wanted something to help with that before i put my make up on
will never use this product again.
why companies need to put so much perfume in products that we are putting on delicate skin
also a little does go along way
or at least for me
it did not seem to absorb as quickly
make sure you try a sample of this before investing in the product
i did want to like this product since it came highly recommended
it was one of a few products you can also apply under the eyes
i can find one of those for a whole lot less money
like all of tata's products i have tried
it would be great for someone who is young
when i did not use it for a day the bumps were gone
maybe it will work out great for people with less sensitive skin or different skin type
may be better for more mature skin?
i think this eye cream would be great for people in their early 20s
i will be staying away from it in the future
which probably isnt a problem for most people
might have been lovely
it does absorb rather quickly though so that is a plus
after using this consistently for about a month i really didn't notice any difference
i speak from experience- i used a little too much
as i continue to use it
while i did use a light amount each time
when i touched under my eyes i could feel some of the product on top so for my skin it didn't absorb fully
i find that to be the case with all of fresh's line
i actually think that in the duration of using this product
i really had high hopes
i probably have a stubborn case
it didn't perform for me as it had for other reviewers
i can definitely say they were lighter
rritated after using it consistently for so long that i had to stop using it altogether
i would say there was some effectiveness
this would probably work better
am hoping that i start to see some fading
this may still work for you since it looks like others have had great results
is it too early to tell?
i hope to try other masks with better results.
what initially i was about to do
it was not effective at all.
i'd be interested to try it again using the origins maskimizer to see if that amps the results at all
i gave this product two stars instead of 1 only because i think had i left the strip on longer maybe there would have been some change
would rather have a six pack of those than this for the same price
i actually find that a lot of cheaper drugstore ones work much better
they did not pick up much or seemed to work properly to remove much
just move past these
don't get nearly as good of results
will not buy again since drugstore ones work better
feel like only the second step was worth anything at all
i tried this mask/patch more than once with the same unsatisfactory results each time
none from the sides where there are alot
i used this product one and there was 0 results.
was expecting this strip to be great
maybe my nose was too heavy duty for what this is expected to do
i will never use these again.
i guess there were supposed to be two strips.
the truth is that i have gotten better results with the drug store br
this may be the worst product i have ever tried from sephora
not only was this not that, it was horrible!
could not move or it would fall off
decided to give these a try
after further usage i realized it just simply doesn't work the way i expected it to
this doesn't work any better than any of the other br
i cannot see any improvement after using this product
i should have realized how this patch would work
they always fall short
i don't believe this one claims to help with dark circles
can't see myself justifying paying 150 dollars for two eye-creams while only truly loving one
i wanted to help others who are struggling on whether they should buy this creme or not
like many of the reviewers here
the closest i've come to find is algenist
i hope that they consider changing the packaging.
if they separated them i'd definitely buy the day cream
so wish these were sold separately
too many of us have that negative affect.
this mask worked less than if not the same as regular drugstore masks
even when used regularly
there are so many other masks out that do a much better job
i will be completely honest in saying i have never found a cream i wouldn't use due to fragrance- until this little gem found it's way into my life
i never even got to use the product it was so
try literally any other glamglow product.
this was far from it
i would recommend trying another product from the lineup rather than this one
could try it prior to making my decision
i don't find that the results last very long
also for this price point i feel like i can find better masks
this is a little expensive for the results i see
i would like a warning
don't plan on looking all bumpy a week where i won't be in public
will not be using.
i expected something better from this line.
i didn't see much of a result from this one
will not use this again.
however it needs at least 2 weeks before you can judge it
after about 2 weeks i can say i am a big fan of this mask because now my skin has cleared
i still like the other supermud better since it worked instantly
i believe it was too strong
could barely keep it on for more than 10 minutes because the burning was so bad
i do think there are likely better options for the price
otherwise it would have been to drying
i think this mask should be used seldom
possibly for only 10 minutes if you have sensitive skin to reap the benefits
will be returning it.
this stuff made my pores worse than they were before
could tell i would be irritated -- wasn't able to keep this on for the recommended time frame
hoping to have more success with that one
if i had to get another anti-aging
after multiple uses one side "finished" i guess while the other side still has alot of product in it
you would think both sides would be equal
i would equally use a pump on each side
after only being able to use only one side i didn't feel that much of a difference on my skin
there was no way i used all of the one side of the product
one side would not dispense properly.
i couldn't quite believe it was the serum responsible for this
i therefore cannot give this product anything more than one star
sadly i had to return this product
i did find the dual pump easier to dispense one side at a time
sometimes you get tons of one &zero of the other.
the other annoying thing is that it is very unclear as to whether one should apply this product under the conducting gel before using the nuface device or not
i'll once again be using sephora's awesome return program
i will never use this again.
i also play the "how long can i keep my eyes stuck like this?"
after i started using this i have it has given me more lines
i find i have better results with them
i get the new look.
i actually see more fine lines in the morning from the gel hold the skin together in the same position
maybe if i were younger it would receive a better review
wanted to try this product next
i find it works for the most part
i guess that would be a plus if my under eyes looked different
tried them consecutively to make certain i was giving the product time to work with my skin
should be relatively quick
if i would have wanted a over-night product i would have been satisfied since it is hydrating et have a nice cool fell
i guess that i was badly advised instead of this being a bad product
was willing to fight through it just to see any results
bags were still there
the only reason i gave it two stars is because i did not experience any negative reactions to this product
it did not absorb well at all
which is not right to have it on the face
i've tried it so many times.
have used it on
have been trying different ones
had enough to write a review
normally i only have very light bags
since i am starting to see a bit more more fine lines
i figured i'd keep trying in hopes it will improve
so far no such luck
at this point i would feel bad returning it.
that was the only benefit for me
i expected to possibly see some of my eyebag reduction
even for something meant for night usage
i need something stronger than this product probably
every time i use it
probably adding to the bags
what i didn't like was that i've put it on religiously for a month
i also did not find much improvement.
i do not see any difference with my under eye bags after a month of use
i tried it for a few days thinking maybe it would be better
for the price i think there are other options that work better
however i i'll not be able to tell results from it due to it being so sticky
this will be my first ever returned product.
it did not absorb well at all.
i sent it back as this is not the same nor has the same effects
my face would tend to get very red after use.
i will give it one more try
of course i'm the 1 in 10000 who didn't find this product as amazing as the reviews
many cheaper masks can do that
i do not have sensitive skin at all
if it continues the same, i'll return it.
with that being said
decided to give these a try since they were also highly recommended by a sales associate
will definitely be returning this.
nothing could be further from the truth.
this will be going back... a first for me.
while this did the job
was surprised that when i used this
if i had paid for it i would have definitly returned
according to the reviews this seemed like a good product to try
anyone with sensitive eyes should probably avoid this
there are way better products out there
i am unable to tolerate that much fragrance on my face
i knew it was caused by this cream because it was the only new thing i had used
i will be switching back to the precious line
felt that it was too strong to have on my face
i did not give it long enough to see how the anti aging benefits were
that being said, i do not like the jar it is in.
i especially liked the fact the it was for all skin types
i am on the hunt to find a cleansing regime that will hopefully fix this problem
i'll give it some more time
there certainly are better ones out there for this price
i feel like there are other serums on the market that can do more than this
you have to keep at it or it all stops
i just know that stuff in pumps always has more left in it
found out it didn't do much at all to 'correct' the age lines on my face
while waiting at the clinique counter a customer was wondering if it really worked
or at least could not see them
needless to say i will be returning.
will try a few more times but not hopeful
i should have returned it
i didn't notice any changes in the 3 weeks i've used it plus i was using 4 pumps to even feel like i was getting coverage
i think paying $60 every 2 weeks is a bit much.
if money is no issue for you then i highly recommend this product
i should have know better.
maybe i should have tried it more consistently
do i see any long term effects toward my face
the best use i have come up with is to wear when i'm going out makeup-less
won't be getting another one
you should just spend your money on repair laser focus instead
not that winter needed more help
i read several reviews that also raved about how well it took off makeup
s for many years just because it's just so convenient to take your make up off
this oil didn't really meet the expectation i had from the other oils
it may just be my skin type
i can get past that if the product is amazing
not there yet but hoping it will just work out!
this really didn't seem to help at all with those
i've tried other things that work better for a lower price
what it had seemed like it would not last awhile
i will be going back to it
it is the first eye cream i've purchased from sephora that i did not like
in my opinion by far the best
will keep using those
would not sustain my skin alone
the stuff should be able to st
need more time with this product.
i enjoy trying new creams although i know that none of the creams will work miracles including this one
i certainly doubt if it will help with firming the skin
i do not believe that it could help sagging skin due to the normal aging process
none have been perfected or proven to actually work
no miracles as yet!
i usually think of a product that has a consistency that would allow having it massaged in the face without worrying that it would run through your fingers like water
i lost a lot of product on the first use because i had no idea it's going to just pure out the tube
i am not up satisfied with the application side of it
couldn't even focus on looking at my skin to see if it made a difference because it was so overpowering
this product must be used up quickly.
i immediately had to try this stuff after reading about it
after using it, i did see some immediate results.
although i will say this
a couple of people were happy with this product
no better than much lesser priced products i have tried in the past
just like the rest of ren's products
it says to use every other day.
i would give it zero stars if that were an option
perhaps it works better on younger skin
i just came online to see if others experienced the burning that i am having after having used this product
it was not happy with this one
as soon as i put this product on my face
what i really disliked about it was the texture: after mixing with a bit of water as instructed
i liked the product after initially using it
am usually pretty weary when trying new things
i don't feel any change after more than a week of use
i'll no longer be continuing to use it as the product itself seems rather pointless
a couple week's use and still no different.
however once i have other better products at h
i also didn't like adding another step to my skin routine
i would generally not recommend to use it too often
this was good when you first use it
i would not use this product again.
there is no need for this at all
have to stop using it
will not use again.
got this to use with it
im sure it would give more benefits to more mature skin
guess this is not for my skin type?anyways i will keep using it for a few more weeks in the hope that it will gradually make my skin look better
maybe more suitable for this than me
does make give me slight acne if i use multiple days in a row
going to considering trying another option once my bottle runs out to see if there are any major differences in my skins texture
i wouldn't recommend it- there are better ones out there
this one was not for me
where as you can get bigger
you have to look online
i could never deal with the old
as others have said
i tried using it different ways
none worked for me i still had makeup on
i felt like there were cheaper alternative out there to try
so do many other things
there are other products that do this faster
i will never purchase it again as there are better products out there
hopefully the half of tube i have left will be good next winter
i will definitely use it a few more times to see
am determined to use it up
thankfully this is the only one in the set that i did not like
there are much much better cleansers out there
at first i thought i was using too much product
i wish i'd found out more about it before purchasing
i will definitely be returning this
the feeling of the product does take some getting used to at first
would use those again
i would never use this again.
i will give the other products a chance
the main reason i am only giving this 2 stars is that after these weeks of regular use
i continue to use it because i have it around
maybe avoid this product
hoped that it would be an improvement on my current eye treatment product
it was though i wasn't using any product at all
hoped it would do something for my dark circles
they didn't improve at all
i gave this three stars still because i can see how this would be great for someone with very dry
i tried using less
at this point i'm just using it to use it up.
i've never had that problem with the products i use
which is more than i can say for other products i've tried that promise the same results
i would definitely use this again if the packaging was changed
then you're left not being able to see for some time
that being said there's no point to it.
i find myself scooping more than i need of this
instead of being able to do one measured pump
however there is still a lot of make up left on my face so not sure i will purchase this again
will be returning it
you will not believe the amount of makeup that was still on my face
giving it to my cousin as it would be better suited for her needs
because this would have been a waste of money
was hoping this would work for me
at least in the clear areas
my 42 year old perfectly normal skin did not like this product in the least
if i had continued to use it
note: i am certain it was this product
i really needed to use a lot to cover my face
for now i am using a product that doesn't work as well just to avoid this packaging
hopefully someday the packing will change
this was not it.
there are many other cleansers out there that i'd turn to before this one
you can open them with the product on them
might be great if you have normal skin.
which is why i was so surprised by what a disaster this one is
would have been nice to see ingredients on the website because i wouldn't have purchased this
which makes me worry that this product may not be gentle enough for the eye area
may not be using it for the eye area for much longer
another sephora employee said that it will not work well on customers in their 20's
especially for how expensive it is
i did like that it absorbed quickly.
now i must find another eye product to repair the damage
it had all the right ingredients.
i am getting to an age where fine lines are deeper
was hoping it would continue to be beautiful
t is great for fall
this product did not deliver that result for me.
i would have given it zero stars
not so much so that i would shell out this amount of money
unfortunately this was not it.
would have gotten 5 stars if it would have been dimethicone free
not even as good as many eye creams i have tried.
i wish they would take some of the fragrance out f their skin care products
after looking at all the great reviews i decided to try it
this stuff would honestly only work for people who have extremely dry
i tried applying less with the same result.
but there are two problems with it.
while that might be great for some
i definitely prefer that over this
got the sample size to try after hearing so many good things
i struggle with darkspots all the time
i only use about one pump
was not getting good results from what i was using
this will do the same
i will be returning.
i kept using it because i know that my skin can be sensitive
i did notice that my face looked like it had a bit of the glow in the morning which is why i gave the cream 3 stars as i am accounting for my skin issues as well
i like that the pump gives you the exact amount each time so there is no waste
i can see this going very quickly at this rate .
that might be because i do not have dry skin
i know it was from this because it was the only new product in my routine
i usually do fine with most of them
i also felt that i was going through it quite quickly
i really should have returned this.
even though it specifically says in description that it 'removes even the most intense makeup'
it did not work as expected for me.
also, the pump top was very difficult to use.
it was just the pump not working
never got to use it
the reviews were really good
how people are saying its calming
it didnt calm anything at all
i very much like how it is instantly absorbed
there was enough for two applications
if i can find the receipt for this i will definitely be returning it
i will be returning this.
i spent all this money on such a tiny product that did not help my pores at all
there are many great moisturizer can do the same
i very much like how it is instantly absorbed
there are better products out there
if this is the case
so most of what i put on my face was only the clear part of the serum which i don't believe there is anything extraordinarily beneficial in
i'll have to do more research.
in multiple places i had read that this was fantastic as a st
nor how little of the product will actually dispense from one usage to the next
sadly i wasnt pleased or see any results i used it as the direction
to find out if this was normal before i reorder
three for the serum that i didn't get enough time with
i also did not notice any benefits of the product
i will be returning since moisture was my primary motivation for buying
i figured out that i would be spending over $900/year on this product alone
which they are not
hard to tell since the bottles are so small
so really i got no benefit from using this stuff.
do not like this more than the last amorepacific product i tested before
there are a lot of better products that do the same
i will be returning this product.
the shape of my face didn't look different for the amount of money i spent on this little bottle
it has a lot of alcohol in it
i rarely give up on a product
find they deliver what they promise
not in this case
it might have some results but, no, thanks.
i am one of those people who have to change cosmetics all the time
have generally liked them
there is no way this should cost as much as it does
thought this could help
the product absorbs very fast so you should spot apply it if i were you
i think it is nice to use in certain targeted spots
could still return it
it seems to work for most people though
it wasnt long lasting enough
so that could be the issue
it also can be that i live in a city where it is so cold that often nothing helps
probably will go on my hands...
i will be returning.
am not only massively disappointed with the packaging – particularly for the amount i paid –
i really wanted to like this product because i could see proof of dirt being removed
how anyone gets their face clean just using this product
it may work fine that way
on its own as anything
i'd rather pay for three products that do what they say they will than one which only half does
which would be a lot less hassle
it's not the multi-tasker i hoped it would be
almost shut from using this product i do not recommend at all
would not recommend at all.
wish i would have read reviews before using this on my face
thought this would have at least helped with that
no product can do that regardless of their promises
i will say it takes very little each night to cover my face
imagine this will last a long while.
i agree with some of the other reviews
this one is not one of the best i've tried
i could feel it slightly
will definitely not be using again.
i am a side sleeper so that could be why this product hasn't worked for me
overall, i am still trying the mask on.
found that it just didn't seem the same
i need like five different masks.
the only reason i am not complaining about the price is because i got this while sephora had 20% off
however i have been breaking out more with this
i do like many of their other products
i've only used this once so far
was able to try it out twice
not at all the miracle product most reviews live it up to be
creating urgency that we have to buy something
not sure what ingredient i reacted two
i will probably be returning.
i've even been to my aesthetician to try
so that was another concern about using this product after i felt how greasy
my wrinkles aren't even that deep so maybe i was expecting too big of results
it may work for some people
as i feel products work best when used together
did not seem to have the results that i had just using the sample
i didn't find this product useful at all.
i think that product worked better than needles no more
it did not show a single result
don't expect it to be there for the long haul
perhaps my wrinkles are to far gone for this product to be effective
the lines are actually worse on that side than before i started using it
what she didn't mention is that if the product is under half way full it can not be returned
today i tried to return the product to the store because it did nothing for my fine lines
it's so much better than needles no more
this is not even close to being worth it!!
or look for another product that'll actually help with aging concerns
other lyrics using the product on a few small areas i feel that this product doesn't last nearly long enough
if a product is going to cost this much for so little use
i expect more than a mininal difference
i also didn't see that it was having any sort of cumulative effect over time when using every day
it was easily able to be layered with
disappointed that the cost is so high for such a small amount
this product does work--or at least temporarily
not sure if it will have lasting effects since i will not be purchasing again
it seems like the people who had the most success with it were using it on their forehead
this product did not work all that well for me
maybe would be better for someone younger
the more you get injections the longer it lasts so visits can get spread out longer
it is very annoying i have to hit it get any product out
i just did not feel satisfied with this product as i have used
was eager to try this
you get such a small amnt of product
this was a complete fail for me
was hoping for more
the less it seemed to be working
my skin must have adjusted to whatever's in it
if it allowed me to choose no stars for the rating i would have
sadly i had to choose at least one star in order to post this review
this one deserved to be reviewed because it did absolutely nothing that it claimed
because some fools-- me being one in this case-- end up shelling out even more
so too bad for them
the are many products that promise to 'blur' lines right now
they do so by giving the product a certain consistency that works with light
so that while you are wearing it
with "needles no more" this absolutely is not true
even the temporary illusion that come be part of the promise-- in line with other 'blurring' products-- is not true
there are many other options out there
this is nowhere near b*tox and never will be.
it did temporarily improve the look of fine lines
i've always been able to get rid of them with some spot treatments fast
it says right on the bottle that it should take away oil
i feel like maybe another product on their line would be more beneficial for me personally
i needed it to badly as i've been breaking out terribly recently
although at first it seemed to work for my skin.
it worked for a week like a pump should
i could only get out tiny little amounts of the product at a time
if the both of us have had the same issue i'm sure many others have experienced this as well
going to be returning this.
especially because of the many 5-star reviews i saw before purchasing this
i will not be recommending this product to anyone
i keep getting new ones and i've just given up.
this product was just too hard to use
i don't like products that have to be applied in a very specific way to even work at all
the company can do better.
was sure this must be the culprit
it has good ones
skin is better now i did return back
thought that this would just make it 20x better
it would be tolerable if the product actually worked
it doesn't seem to help much with even moderate breakouts
this has made me break out even more
was challenged by a sales rep to try the product for 3 weeks since according to clarins 3 weeks is what you need to change your skin with this oil
this was not that for me
so you have to force it down
though not as much of an issue if you double cleanse
i would be spending a few good minutes trying to get it off
it felt like there was a layer of oil that would just be there
will not use again.
maybe i was using it incorrectly?
the results for me were less than subpar.
i even use it with my clarisonic
this is too expensive to perform the way it does for me to ever buy it again
all were a complete fail
it is probably good enough if you are young
this also makes me break out if i use it too many days in a row
i will look into other moistuzers
it seems like it should be a good product though
you might not be able to reap the benefits on this one
i might save it
which is kind of the opposite that i expected
i finally figured out that the reason my skin was struggling so much was because of this
it's usually reasonable with the pricing so when sephora didn't have the price tag i decided to get it not knowing it was going to be $50 so then when i leave i have to open it to see what the $50 was worth
but, all in all, on to the next.
have waited to give a review because i really wanted this to work for me
apparently this is the newer version or intended to take the place of eye hope
the longer i used it
for someone older hoping for the "renewing" results the eye cream promises
i would predict this product would be a disappointment
there are so many more effective
i wasn't able to see long-term benefits because
hoping it would improve
doubt i will see any benefit
it's the first time that i've wished i could return a perk
i gave it 2 points rather than 1 because i have very sensitive skin
not have them burn
have been using this faithfully
was keen to try it
was disappointed that it did not remove my makeup very well at all
they work just as well if not better
just not impressed enough to consider purchasing something quite so expensive
now i am starting to realize how unnecessary it is
it seemed as if it worked.
then try a different one
that was not the case with this.
you know it has to be horrible if i had to be that person that returns a used item to sephora
i do think there are other better oil cleansers out there
though i am no longer a young person now
i still prefer to be surrounded by products that you would not find on a gr
wasn't what i expected from a tatcha product
i've had more breakouts using it than i've ever had in my life
i believe there are drugstore alternatives that could do the same
had to exchange it for something else
all over my face that were impossible to get rid of
which i definitely have
it will allow you to try out the product for a few weeks to see how it works for you
im going to keep using it for 2 more days
try to apply over all this combination
they are meant to be used to seal in all the good stuff you have just put on your face before you go to bed at night
there is no way i could see wearing this under makeup it seems it would just slide right off
gave it 3 stars since i haven't made up my mind as to whether or not to keep it
i did get some spots while using this
this would probably be fine for most skin types
if should not be this hard
i really wanted this to work even with the high price tag
used them both at night like it said to
decided to give it the benefit of the doubt
or at least not enough difference to justify $90
there are so many better serums out there.
maybe my expectations were too high
not sure how people are calling this the holy grail
i want to give this product five stars
i figure being preventative is better than nothing
i just though maybe just maybe this product would work the second time around
other then that this just wasn't strong enough on my skin
there are many less expensive
my pores look the same so at this point i am looking at it
the products that i just must totally absorb into the skin
i personally didn't see a big difference at all in my skin after using it for a week
it might be meant for some people with more normal skin
i went over directions to be sure i was using correctly
so they said this product would work wonders
i feel like there are better products out there
when i used it
hoping this would help to normalize my skin
however, i am giving this product only 3 stars.
not sure if the two are related
i chose it because i was told it would be great for sensitive skin
will continue to find something more cost-effective
this one being by far the worse.
as i think the bar would last a very long time
the routine just did not work for my skin at all
would probably be a good bar to use with a foreo or a clarisonic
all in all set was a good idea as i am new to the line
it comes with 5 different products to try out
i won't be purchasing full size bar @ $28 as i feel like there are lots of cleansers out there that are just as good if not better then this bar
i kept using this cleanser way longer than i should have
a real drunk elephant would be more useful to the world
i just want to address a couple issues i had reading these other reviews:a
if i used this in the summer it might be better
i found the pekee to be just okay
i found it to be messy to both use
like many i got the travel size duo with peekee.
i now use them randomly just to use them up.
i used it with my clarisonic
can get into your eyes even if they are closed
the more i've used it
will try it for another week to give it some time before i decide to return it or not
i can see this bar lasting a long time
thought i'd use it on my face
probably will not use it everyday
i will try other products from this line
and i may give it another shot in the future.
i will not apply the bar directly to the face
at $100 i had hoped for something!
told me i'd be much happier using this product than the one i was about to purchase
i should have stuck with the product i had researched
i didn't realize any sephora employees work on commission
she got some sort of recognition for extra caudalie sales that day
hopefully that one will give me better results!
so far i like the product
wish it was thicker or had different application process
will continue to use it.
to each there own on that determination
i did not have a bad reaction to it as some people do when it's contained in cosmetics
i usually always follow up with bioderma
i only used it once but that was enough.
i wanted this to work because the ingredients are there
still not convincing enough to keep
because i tend to really like the other korres products
that i could easily see make up still on me after cleansing
i would try going through the cleansing process a second time because i had no other cleanser
to be fair it cleaned more the second time
so maybe this stuff is better for other skin types
not so much so that they should include it in the title
it has never been able to take all of the makeup off
it feels so awful that i always have to use another face wash immediately afterwards
i might even return it
if you are willing to spent around $40 to make your under-eyes soft
just added another step to my already too long daily routine
i should've done some research before
if you are in your 20s or older
personally this product works but only half way.
didn't see any results other than my under eye area felt smooth for like a day
the other off for not being a game changer
make up does not go on very well without another eye cream
i just wish that it would be bigger because it is too expensive which is why i won't give it more stars
i do not have an issue with dark circles
i tried it several different times just to give it a chance
i wish i could find my receipt to return this
i must say that i'm disappointed
not really noticing much hopefully will get something from spending 30$
in the end it didn't work :/ for me at least
after reading so many great reviews i decided to give this product a try
therefore will be returning
it is better to use it when no using make up ar all or little
i am so tired of seeing all these yt reviews from people who are getting these free
i think they are trying to market to teens
this product is different than any other eye cream i've used
i would still have to return it because of how strong the fragrance is
not as much as other products that are more effective
i'll be going back to clinique's even better eyes
the product might be great
couldn't get past the negatives
hard after using this that i realized no good could come from that
this would be a good go-to
it would probably be best for you
i only used a sampler of this so maybe one day of using it may not have yielded the best results
will not use again.
thought that this would be no exception
was trying to find something less expensive
i used it with my clarisonic
i will be returning it.
otherwise i would have given it zero stars.
no results at all
i really think their products are much better suited to people in their late teens to mid 20s--when your skin is young
i've had much better success with other br
will continue to use them instead
i like to alternate between products so this one goes into rotation once a week or less
if you use this twice a day as instructed your going to be buying several of these a year
chances are that whole bottle isn't full
it has a ways to go
this did not accomplish any of the three
actually looked more like a primer
except for the fact that i have sensitive skin
because i was really hoping there was finally a good product for my age group
i think there are more suitable serums for me out there
it also has a weird sticky feeling which i did not like i used the product for 2 weeks to give it a good amount of time to actually work
it might be great for a nighttime treatment only
at least not for me
used it for a little bit longer my skin would clear up
the serum would give me all the benefits that everyone had been raving about
i will have to keep shopping around for a serum better suited for my skin
at least there are no more huge breakouts
are just in the process of wanting to take care of your
i decided to give this product a try since i read that it was created for younger women in their twenties
i find that i prefer the seacret balancing face serum much better than this product
i feel like it would work better on people with normal to combination skin
use so much of it
why is it all gold?
get the same results
looks exactly the same as it did before using it
may be better suited to younger skin.
i would agree with the others that it is more of a primer
what i really disliked about this is that applying it made me pull on my skin to spread it around which is absolutely what i try to avoid
i most likely will use the rest
am hoping eventually they will go away
probably use more than i should to avoid that
i've used this product so many times
for that price i want to see results after the first time i use it
i'll stick to other products which have given visible results after even one use
i even tried it doing it in different ways
so not worth the $80.00 definitely returning.
it has not been at all helpful for my skin
the first two times i used it it did absolutely nothing to my skin
i always use a clarisonic on my face
these two have done more than this gold mask alone
this must be one of the least effective
i personally can picture this mask being worth about $15 for the hydration i get from it
it did not firm or lift as it states it will
so that is why i only gave it 3 stars
i'd have to use my clarisonic to get all of the product off
i need to leave it on for a long time for it to work
i wish i had read the reviews first then i would have known not to expect it to dry
could try this one
i wish it had worked as well as i wanted it to
in fact the results are very temporary
having put too much hope in the claims to tighten
even if it was temporary
you will have an opportunity to see more results
i think i will return it because $80 is a lot for a product that i can’t see results
which i guess can be expected since its "mud
i've actually not been terribly impressed by any of them
this one is probably my least favourite of the bunch
there are masks that do the same thing for a fraction of the price
it may be worth looking into
make them appear smaller
so far nothing has really worked i was hoping this would be the one
use it every other week or my face gets
products can only temporary constrict them so they look a little smaller
had high hopes for this one
i think this is probably a much better product for people with oily
the only issue i have
something i have to deal with should i continue to use this product
it is not as good as i expected
i still use it
other cleansers can do the same thing with lower price
i could have gotten over it if the smell went away after applying because the effects of it are amazing
i feel that it needs to be reapplied throughout the day
am better off just combining what i already have to get a longer-lasting glow with mositure
for something that's over $100 should work by now
wrinkles at the same time should not be an option
i do really like several of the other products in the kit
i didn't really see any results from using it besides having a clean face
that i realized that it was for all skin types except sensitive
this was not the case with the "all skin types" bottle
leaves me feeling betrayed because the sample was simply a ploy to have me buy the full size
washed it off thinking this would be the best product ever
i need something a little more effective for my problematic skin
this product is not something i can use on daily basis
so, i usually avoid ptr for a couple reasons.
there are always so many chemicals in their products
i heard a lot of other people feeling this way too
i wanted this product to work for me so badly as it has so many benefits
i found that people were purchasing this more for dark circles
is not very smooth once applied
there are a lot of other eye products out there that are much more effective
it did help in reducing them
i highly suggest trying a sample before you buy
that might be an issue
i don't like that this is for under the eyes only either because it means i now need another eye cream for my upper eye area
for $100 i should be able to wear this solo
i must say i will never trust their word on a product again
i think i will stick to drugstore products on some of my beauty products because they have always worked for me
it does work on circles though.
i do still use the product
i used it all up
i will use it all up though
it may be for some
as soon as i read the ingredients in this one
lines where there were none
i will keep using other products from his line though
will not use again.
they have always been dark even when i was a child
i do like his other products that i have tried.
was perfectly willing to spend $100 for a treatment that would help diminish my dark circles
i'll give it that much.
no results yet- though i still hope
then after it has absorbed i feel like i still need to add a mositurizer
the only thing i have noticed so far is that it is very drying
this one doesn't seem to be very effective
i will continue to use it
think its best to give it more time
maybe works better for others
they are still there
i am sure it might work on others
as soon as i applied it
this is my second time that i used this product.
for $100 i was expecting a lot more.
i want results if i'm paying this much for an eye cream
since it cost so much i still use it.
therefore i am still working with it!
i know a lot of people see great results from this eye cream
they are still there
hoping for more improvement as time goes on
i still have them
as i said in the title i liked this enough to buy it twice
using my clarisonic is without a doubt better than using this
returned 2 of these because i cannot get the product out of the can
it is getting annoying having to return it to try to find a bottle that allows me to get the product
i definitely think that there are equally as good cleansers out there that'll be cheaper
will be completely returning in store.
not really sure it works any better than some of the other sephora cleansers i've used in the past
i think this is too much for daily use
sometimes i add half a pump more
i found it very so so
i will not continue using this product.
i should have read into the ingredients more
i will be returning.
i think this may have been too harsh
may still keep as once a week treatment-not sure.
i ended up returning it because if i am going to pay this much results are a must
this specific product by glamglow just didn't work for me
i also now know that its not just my skin that this happened to after looking at the reviews
i need to stop using this immediately because my skin has never been so dry
a few people definitely are
for some that might be a problem
they all are horrible
this is the first product that i tried from glamglow
it seems to have broken me out in less than two days which is quite odd because i don't break out
i do still love other products from this line
the total opposite of what i was hoping for.
i think i may just return it to the store since i won't be getting any further use out of it
not as bad as how this made it
i gave this a 2 more weeks to see if it was just my skin reacting to a new product
i could not justify keeping it
the only reason why i'm giving 2 stars is the scent
i used it twice because the effects were not immediate
wish it would have worked!
i will never ever in my life use this product again
given my bad reaction to it i'll just have to skip out on buying this in the future
i know others have had success with this
i should have returned it
however no matter how long i waited or how much i tapped
not good enough to be a three
then as others mentioned
bought this hoping to see some difference
unfortunately, i will be returning it.
have never had a problem like this
beyond that which is really what i needed
it was like i had nothing on.
go back to my much more expensive lancome eye cream that does the job
i know that this product is meant to be all natural
i never review products but i had to warn people.
i think i'm in the minority here.
i will say that it never made my skin breakout
that was not true.
there are many oil cleansers out there that are far superior to this
when i used it
while this seems to work better than the others
this was the first time i used a cleansing oil so that was a whole new experience
there are skin care products that do not have these horrible ingredients
however the scent should have been a warning sign
there a lot of other micellar products that do the same thing for a lot less
this one was not for me
just got this last week thought it would be great
the more i used it the more they kept coming now my clear skin that i have to work so hard to maintain is a zitty mess :
'm hoping for at least store credit since sephora has a great return policy
how fast i'd have to go through that bottle because it's not the most effective
this is far too expensive to be going through a bottle a month
i really wish they would come out with a lighter version
just wish the tiny was a little more transparent
it shouldn't be that difficult to find this combo in a well made product
ultimately returned them both
so if this was too heavy for me something's off.
the skin on my face are totally different
i should have known better
since i like other perricone product
i could feel it on my face all day
had hoped that this would provide the same type of coverage
i should have waited to try it out in the store first
but did a number on my face.
i wish i would have seen this before i ordered.
the only thing i am happy about is that this was only a 10 day sample pack
i went through a couple pages of reviews to see if i could find someone who say this dried their skin out
maybe with longer use it might make a difference
maybe the ingredients were not working on my type of skin
i'd never tried any algenist product before
for some reason was absolutely convinced that i needed this serum
i don't expect results from any product after using only
i figured a little more than half an ounce was giving a serum a fair chance
not sure it works better than any other serum
i didn't see any results with this product at all
now i will only use it for the back of my h
where is this coming from?
i wish i could have my points back
did not use for long.
a few in places i never normally break out
i've never had another serum do that
say that this is $140
i would give this another chance if they omitted the coumarin
i absolutely had to return this.
i can use it around my eyes.
this product did not cause me to have any serious reactions like most products of this nature usually do
after using it for some time it did cause me to breakout
i no longer use it as a mask
just not from this line
there are better out there
there are much worse as well
i find that in this case
there has long been a "debate" if you will on the long term effects of "beads" on the skin
but unfortunately, it was not suitable for skin.
so i had to return it.
and i mean not even one benefit from this.
i know a lot of people commented that the results don’t last that long
the results didn’t even exist for me
would be better off if you doubled your water intake for a few days for actual results
that was about it
did see a brighting effect right after using it
which makes it hard to see where you already applied product
a bit pricy if i'm using it on both arms every night though
this never happened to my skin with any other products
i assumed there would be .
like others have mentioned
this product may work for certain people/skin types
it's been almost 3 weeks of using it exactally the way you are supposed to
disappointed will be returning
even if this product worked as stated
felt like more water than anything
was hoping it would work
at least i could return it.
but this did not meet expectations!
i must say i prefer the older one better.
the older product was in a pump which i feel like was easier to control how much product came out at once
i will keep using it until the box is done
it is just time-consuming in the am with little payoff
although this can be a little messy the benefits outweigh the negative by far
how convenient to be able to pick the properties one wants in a serum
the mess made me feel as though too much would end up getting unintentionally wasted when trying to use
they are so gentle and do the job.
actually closer to only 1/2 full
i couldn't use it more than once.
it will remain a once-in-a-while scrub for me
which is why i give it three stars
not even close to sensitive as other people i know
this was not it.
when i used it
i just wish it were a little easier to use
then found it quite a
so i had to try this!
when i first used it i could see it was only 3/4 full
i will be returning this
if they made this a perfume, i would but it!
it took time for it to show the result after i decided to not continue using it
far less product than what i thought there would be for the size of the bottle
had high hopes for this product being able to relieve my grievances
placement where i've never even had them before
i wouldn't recommend this for anyone under 35-40- when the age of blemishes are less likely to ever occur
this product should do better for those of that age group
i wish i could have given it no stars.
results could be different on you
as far as it working
made may face sticky i did not see a difference i gave it to my mother maybe it will work for her since she is older
it can be hard to tell a difference in your skin-especially when you are using multiple products
i used this a lot when i first got it
so beware if you are sensitive--try a sample first
assumed it was by those who were highly sensitive
this one is the one for you
i find it much too strong
if it were less expensive for the amount you get
i also think it is recommended
going to use the rest of the bottle to see how much more it will lighten up my spots
used it for quite sometime
while the person at sephora who was helping me was sure it will
will be returning it
in the past i have had really good
it is supposed to be 20%
or even much less
i figured i better start using a better under eye cream
i will use a bit longer in hopes i see some change
didn't make my make up last longer
which is actually the only bobbi product i enjoy
hoping it will be terrible
not enough to stay with it
i am grateful that sephora has an awesome sample policy because if i would have purchased the full bottle i definitely would have returned it
as of now i will not continue using this
the "renewed" update of these product's do not even come close to the original
i will sadly have to hunt for another one
it also made my pores look huge which is not normally an issue for me
since that is no longer an option, i tried this.
this is not the same.
with this change i will have to find a new br
very disappointed that they "fixed" something that wasn't broken
this is not the same product at all.
if you were a user of hope in a jar dry skin formula you will be very disappointed in this product
this is not as good as the original hope in a jar
i still use it
it unfortunately did not meet my expectation
i would not be able to leave the house without applying a matt foundation on top
i also needed to start getting consistent with spf
i didn't feel like i was benefiting from it in any way
had to put too much effort to not look shiny
had a hard time finding another moisturizer that felt the same
thought it would have the same formula because i love hope in a jar
sadly that was not the case
my fine lines are still there
maybe i'm expecting too much or paying too close attention
i might give this another star if it were a little more moisturizing
feels like i have to put a lot more on than i would with a regular eye cream
it is not rich at all.
now all of the sudden they are
however this one doesn't quite make the cut
as far as the other benefits it is supposed to have
i got this cream with the intent to use it for both day
so far, for nighttime use, i really like it.
'm a little worried about other reviews suggesting it's different than the full size product
using it alone is fine
seems to improve those fine lines well enough
it seemed to work well on lines
not even that effective
not really worth exploring for me since it is such an expensive product i will not be spending time trying to love it
maybe if i was more on the dry side it would have been as great as everyone says
oil though, that seems to be doing more for me.
i've had better experiences with cheaper oil so you should do your research before splurging on an expensive skin care product
keep in mind i am only 20 so older women might benefit way more from the product
i just started using it because i am getting older
i've had better results from other
i think there may be a beauty or product addiction in this generation because there are so many products i've tried out that everyone claims is the best
my cheaper skin products have done more of a number on my skin than this did
i've had similar results with things that are cheaper
after a few uses i wanted to use it more
even though only three drops a night will cover my needs it isn't working for me
will keep using it for that
oils should really last longer than a year
i tried it for so long
cheaper prodects out there that perform better
she made it seem like i would be reborn once i had this on my vanity
by the end of the week my skin had gotten so bad i'd compare it to the gr
i find it so hard to believe that the first top of the ingredients are natural
which could be a concern
i wanted this to work as there are great reviews on it however it didn't work well with my skin
maybe this works to stop fine lines from appearing rather than eliminating them?it didn't help with redness
in fact, my skin is better without it at all.
this should be a miracle product
there are many of them on the market
had equal if not better results
the women who sold me this was convinced that this would change my life
i personally would not use this daily.
i see my skin actually looking worse than before i used it
i wanted to try a different face oil.
could you find less costly alternatives absolutely
i found that it did none of these things.
the other two are
two stars because i will say that i haven't broken out
not recommended at all to anyone who have my skin type
could be the kinds i got along with my skin type
it will be my last unfortunately
a+ to this company for trying something different
these products do live up to the hype
i can get literally tons of others that come in the amount advertised
i will keep using in the hope that i just haven't been using long enough
not only that, but now i've started to breakout.
i never did experience the problems others had with it being too strong
we are parting ways
why there are so many glowing reviews
other than that this did nothing for my oily
the real issue for me is that each time i apply makeup it balls
make sure i was using the correct amount
many more tries that i should have
then as soon as i try to apply any foundations
will be giving this one away.
my skin has never broken out from a product as much as it did from this
i would have given it zero starts
like the mufe or smashbox one
i typically like to try things out at least 5 times before forming an opinion on it
there is a pump for the product to come out of
there was no tube to allow the product to come up the pump
there wasn't even that much product there
the problem i had was that i find it finishes too fast
it didn't work to control oil very well
read about it in an article that it would work so well for oily skin
that one is much better
my receipt because this would be going back
was hoping for great results from this one too
helping it last much longer
i will never use this again
am always on the hunt for something that will help control it so my foundation stays
i pretty much have the same opinion as many others that have oily skin
might as well not have used it
thought it would work.
i may actually take it back
money i could have spent elsewhere.
it will be my last
i should also mention that i used this product for a month
i will be returning this.
i used it multiple times praying that it would work-
nothing i've tried has ever worked
it seems there are almost no products that don't cause oil to come to the surface
the only way i can keep oil at bay is with a
they didn't have it in store
hoped this would help with that
i tried it for week because i was hoping it wasn't the cause
this product is way to expensive to perform the way it does
the product is only as good when you actually use
i could not commit to applying twice daily
not better than shiseido as promised.
the most annoying of this product is the promise of the sephora representative that swears that the product works for 6 months if i used a half of the pump every time
not nearly as hard as the rep did
you must watch the pump because too much product can be wasted easily
so basically this goes under another product which can get even pricier
once it's gone i do not plan on repurchasing unless i notice a turn for the worse in my under eye area
so, i will be returning this unfortunately :(
have yet to see or feel a difference
that is all so far
it was a huge fail
so many better products that are cheaper
i find it worth the money to do what it claims i am 23 with dry skin an am not using or in a place where i can afford anti aging products
it's just a regular moisturizer which you can get a similar one from drug store within 10 bucks
i've tried so many things
i see most reviews are good
actually made my skin more dry than it already was
will never try again
it may have been the combo
the problem is that it is not build-able under my sun screen
this might not be a better choice
was hoping this would give me the hydration i needed
the more i use it the more i realize how much this strips my face
so this will not be making it in my regular regimen
thought this cleanser would be just as good
there was so much still there
you also use very little product so this will last a long time
however, this is just average to me.
i will definitely be returning it
no cleansing water should ever be the first
not being able to use it on my eyes is a drawback
would have to make the effort to keep it out of my eyes
will probably stick with that
it's good for people who is oily though or just use this in the summer time
this one has not done the job.
might have wrong formula for my skin type.
i think if you have already have balanced
thought i'd give this a try since it's from the same br
this product seemed like any other basic moistrizer
which she told me this would help
will be returning the whole line.
this formula felt good at first then as i continued to use it
i guess i should have read more carefully.
i feel like there are similar products which are just as effective
it has been a love/hate relation with this cream because does not get absorb
that it is why i been using it
especially if they cost less than my current cream
i am so happy i got a sample of this with my last order because i would've been upset about spending money on a product that was a complete failure for me
that was the only new product i used that day.
s should know better than to heavily perfume their face products
it broke me up horribly like no other product has ever done so
i'll use it, but then i'll go back to the other.
maybe this works for some people
this time i did looked at the ingredient list
realize there is alcohol in it
i can see if you have skin on the oily side how this would work well
i learned quickly that i have a dry under eye area
will continue to use it until it's gone
maybe in summer it would be better for me.
it most definitely did not help me with fine lines
that is about it
i only used it at night because it was not good under makeup
was hoping this would firm them up a bit
will be trying to find what works for me
just because there are other great product out there
no results at all
as others have stated
which made it come off better
you only need a little because it spreads well.
thought i would give it a go for hydration purposes
i felt as though this was a waste of money for me
prefer the ginzing one over this
feel they are even more visable now than they have been with other products
this one is not it.
no matter if they cost $10 or $100
are still very present
they have by no means gotten better
at least i can say
this may be good for those with no true under eye issues
i've gotten better results with creams that cost much less
one can find cheaper alternatives everywhere else
i will be trying others after this one is finished
also, it does not absorb quickly at all.
never the less they are there
make me look a lot older than i should
the reviews on this seemed so good i gave it a try
the lines are just as visible as they were before this cream
could take it or leave it
i still need to use up the rest of the bottle
i decided to just stop using this product all together
not this one though.
however it is very light
it is light weight but not for me.
or even what ingredients are in it
there are definitely cheaper oils that do the same thing if not more
i used this once
i found it to have bht
sadly this product did not work with my skin at all
the packaging was so bad i only used it once
i've probably used it 5-6 times
getting both sides to work evenly just is not working
being able to control the amount you get of each
maybe you need more of one side on a given day- like getting 2 products in one
unfortunately the outcome was the same
after a few times of having to do this cumbersome task
too expensive to not have at least good results.
i like other glamglow products but not this one.
i know i used a lot more of the clay
it would be better if they incorporated the two together already
have tried out many of their masks
i think you'd be better off using one of their other cleansers
i will be returning this one
still not seeing any benefits
thankfully for sephora's amazing return policy i was able to return without packaging
i even tried doing more oil
no made it better except to take it back to sephora
stick with the others which are all great.
i can't get past that frustration to really assess the actual cleaning power
i used it once and had to return it.
this was not it.
beyond just adding a few drops to your moisturizer there is no real instruction on how to use it
the trouble is in wanting to use it on more makeup days
call it a day it would be a very nice no makeup option
i never have any problems with makeup coming off during the day until i used this
makes them look worse
can only recommend it to those with no flaky
make me feel younger right after application
however, it does not absorb well at all.
went with this one because it was $35 cheaper
thought it would be just as great
this would probably be great for those with oily skin
this will make it worse
this would be so good for me
as i tried to use it
i believe it had to be the moisturizer because i haven't had this many zits at one time in years
it will probably take me a couple weeks to get my skin back to normal
as far as i was concerned this was a miss for them
may be it will be better if i use it on top of a serum however i dont like to pile products
the addition of the spf must do some weird things to the formula
i tried it several months apart to see if it got any better
this might be for you
there are so many better options out there
can be difficult to spread
this has happened to me in the past when i've used products that are too strongly formulated for my sensitive skin
there are way better products out there
as others have mentioned
i do not need to look even more pale than i already am
i might have been willing to overlook that if this sunscreen had more staying power
certainly not suitable for any kind of
only use it if i am going to be outside for a long time
it was very hard to apply
did not absorb well
thought this would be great
it can be hard to spread on
will give it that
as long as you let it absorb properly
was hoping that this will work for me
i would use this for working outside or beach
this might be fine
almost like the product never really absorbed not matter how long i waited to apply my other products
which made it difficult to work with
it did not help anything with that the day after using it
other clay masks do a much better job that this very poor
was hoping this could be an inexpensive add to my collecting
there are other products that can do better
pretty much the only reason i use it
it does have a very light
i think there may be better ones out there.
i like to use one for both.
they should consider making a two-in-one like the wipes you can get
purchased this because it was recommended by one of the staff members at sephora based on the description i'd given them for what i was in need of
its not bad but its not the best out there.
in combination with the rest of the origins products that i have purchased my skin has never been worse
unfortunately, this wasn't the case with the oil.
definitely unlike any other mask i've used
it also did nothing to help any fine lines on my face
so with all of that
i wish i could use this because it has so much shea
takes longer than i'd like to absorb
see if i have better results with it during winter
think this would probably be a great product for people with severely dry skin
didn't find this heavy enough to provide me the results i expect from a product of this price
perhaps it will work for others
doesn't make any immediate difference besides being reasonably hydrating
still trying this out
you should probably avoid this
i will continue to use
those are where you pores are.
i wanted to try something that could possibly replace the glamglow supermud
how could they changed a good product to this?
have they tried it themselves?
the guy at sephora told me i could use this for that since my skin is too dry to use all over my face
unfortunately i did not receive the expected results
i recently purchased this in hopes of finding a mask that would help with my occasional breakouts
it wasn't helping either
there are other products out there that are more effective for the money you are spending
seemed to help with some blemishes that were coming to the surface to attack them before they fully came out
will try it again
i'll probably still use as a spot treatment
even explained how she often used it as an overnight mask
probably better to do a test area first.
will be returning it if i ever get around to it
i can see this working well for less sensitive
even with the ones that i do
10 out 10 would not recommend testing this out
i will continue to use it
will consider this oil in the future when i need something heavier
it does have a scent that you need to get used to as well
i kept trying it because it was so expensive.
i'll call a sephora store to see if they can offer me some insight for this product??
has anyone else experienced this???
only added this as "something new"
could see the true results
i got this as a sample which might be something to consider while reading my review
i found this to be nothing special at all
like others say the consistently is sticky
since this product is so highly rated i thought it would do wonders for my dry
didn't work as well as i hoped
i will say that this is probably one of the best makeup removers i've ever used
i wanted to make sure i used plenty of it before leaving a review
however, my initial thoughts remain true.
i just didn't have the confidence that my skin was clean
it could be perfect for you
moisturizingcons: difficult to learn how to use
you must follow up with
overall body care so that must be why
again this could be because most of the products i use are all natural
which could be a good thing
who wants to add a seperately eye make up remove
just because i have it
i've tried so many 'oil control' products that don't work
i should have returned this.
i spent $68 on a product that does not work
in fact i'm actually looking to buy something for the day time because of it
there is no way i can apply makeup after using this product
i gave this more than enough time to see a difference
both those reasons combined with the fact that it made no difference to my under eye area is why i would not recommend this product
i honestly was hoping that it would eventually work some magic
i think i expected more from it
there are better products out there.
tight where i use it
eyes actually look worse than they did when i was using other products
it seems to at least apply well
i power though it because i know that it always takes a little time before seeing results-
it takes a little more work than i would like with a toddler running around
i tested this product in a small area on my face to test how it would work with my skin
will probably work better on others
i found the application to be far too messy if i'm in a rush in the morning
because this product did not work at all
my first use was to apply directly to multiple areas of my face
it was more challenging to spread it out
rub it in than expected from a cleanser in what i assume is supposed to be an "easy to use package"
my stick was a bit "stiffer" than what others are describing
however the stick is too soft in consistency to really do that
too much in my opinion
you end up wasting a lot of product
overall not what i expected
all in all though
i'd just prefer that this product be in a tube or something more useful
even if one used it at a sink
so i would test it first.
i know for sure it was this product causing my enlarged pores as it was the only new product i was using
i see i must have used way too much
*plus* there aren't even any good ingredients in here to balance those two mentioned problems out
see if that works better
so far i am not seeing the same results.
still... not the same result.
so maybe that was too much
let's not forget that bees may be harmed in the process of making the product
in case you are interested
'm used to their application
i will never use this product again.
it did seem to even out my skin immediately after application
my face is still a few days later :/ id be cautious if you have dry
probably won't continue to use due to the smell
not certain if the fine lines are less pronounced
i should have returned it.
this is one of the very few times when i was not happy with my purchase
this product does not absorb quickly
no one believes i'll be 40 next year
especially when you use it continuously
returned everything except the make up no more foundation
trying to do damage control.
when i used it
the small sample will give you 4 uses maximum which i think is very over-priced for something that does not make much of a difference to your skin
the results are not significant enough to merit using it regularly in your beauty routine
my skin isn't looking any different than it was before
this is the kind of product you would need to use regularly
the price is not worth it to me to just have soft skin when i have used other masks for half the cost that gave me soft skin
did not work better than most other products i've tried unless they were ineffective as well then it was the same
i do see minimal results from a few of their other products
'll hold onto those
i won't restock as i have found others that work better
maybe it works for other people
i read lots of reviews before putting this on my face
i am sure there are other less expensive options in the market which would perform the same way
there are large pieces of dark *something* in the product that do not appear to do anything for your skin
i like masks where i can see results right away.
i will continue to use until i feel i can cut down to once or twice a week
i've never used any glamglow products before
figured this brightening mask would be a good one to try
might give this a go later on
i'd write one-stars on all of these if i had time
none of these products work for what their price is
seemed to work immediately after one use
seriously i could have saved a ton of money
it would have been just the same
i've tried other exfoliants that work better that aren't nearly as expensive
it just did not give me the noticeable results i'd hoped for
the sephora ones are much better
maybe i was expecting a miracle for the money
also, the smaller version does not last long.
i will definitely be ordering this again for the summer
know that it will not last much longer than a month
this product did not last long
as soon as i put it on
i returned it and had no issues doing so.
there's cheaper products that will deliver the same if not better results
there are better masks out there
was hoping this would be clay
the feeling would persist
my guess is that has a good amount of alcohol on it
expected a lot more from these creme
i expected at least a little bit ofimprovement
it is better than nothing
i've also tried using it at night to see if i get any results for my dark circles
this will be a returned product for me.
can only speak to the short term results:
was shocked at how small the product was for how much it was
i feel like you need more product than i normally would use
unfortunately this will be returned.
see if it's any different than the first 2 or 3 days i used it
might still try other masks
they are the most effective of those that i've tried
not being nearly as impressed
i try not to do the same sleeping mask every night so these little packages are perfect
which is why a lot of people are upset right now that some big companies that claim to be cruelty-free have branched out to china
i tried a few different kinds
there is more than enough in each for multiple uses
they were on their way out
will be sticking with them
it didn't improve my current ones at all
i tried 5 different ones
i wish they came in better packaging
thought this would be good to help out
like that you can get a couple uses from one pod
that will not last
i think this will work well for combination skin
while it does remove my foundation very well
if i had to describe it
super excited to try this cleansing oil since it stated it would remove all types of make-up
the pump did not work smoothly
it was tough to control the amount
especially were never removed completely
the only way to fully remove this oil is by using a wipe of some sort
found myself having to add more to really get it all off
that may be why some said this made their eyes sting
the results weren't what i was expecting
especially if i was wearing contacts at the time of use
found that i had to use more than a full pump of the product to get any foam at all
i feel like i need to use a lot of pumps for it to work
i typically have clear
it just will not absorb
it did not work for my under eye bags at all.
a half i've been using this just not seems to work
hopefully this can help some people out if you are debating on trying this product out
have not had much luck
hated it because it made my whole face so much lighter
i now use this only in spots i want lighter to match the rest of my face
funny how the bad reviews are the only ones with more personal
there might be one application left
the result is similar to that which can be achieved with any good mask
i held out as long as i could because i saw the great reviews
as far as my results
it seemed to work well enough.
so do so many other products at a lower price point
which i found hard to take
i'd like to use it often to see results
it's difficult to apply without using too much of the product
makes me feel like i'm using more product than necessary
i will update if so
i tried multiple times because the other reviews say you must use the product exactly as described
the only way you could make this work is if you can remain expressionless
usually i've had good luck with clinique products in the past
it could be better
you are suppose to use two drops twice a day.
there are a lot more better products out there
i knew it was because of this because once i stopped using this my skin got better
the time i tried this i used way too much
now i know for normal skin type a small amount is good
for the risk of this product breaking on you after one year of use- it is 100% not worth it
not a recommended use but worked for me
i will keep on trying one or two more treatments before i give up
hopefully the 2nd laser will last longer than the first
knowing that i had historically lucked out with skin that doesn't easily irritate
i am not getting the same results
without a doubt, this it because of the tria.
i would also like to add that i have tried a lot of products
therefor it did nothing for them because the laser is only suppose to be used in area's that have bone underneath it
would probably be helpful with someone that has lower eye wrinkles
t's going to be inconvenient to make the return
give it one more try
i used it for some time to give it a chance
my fault for not looking at the ingredients
could initially tell a difference when first applied
not make it worse
i think the purpose of these drops are for just that
well i tried for a week and so no change.
too expensive for something i'm sure i can find elsewhere
it works for my dry areas better that way.
thought this would be the perfect addition to my skin care routine
), but i could not deal with the stickiness.
i knew the risk i was taking
the best moisterizer i've ever used
how soft it was while applying
i seem to be the only reviewer so far with a negative outcome with this product
the renewed hope in a jar works much better for me
will be trying a different product now that i finished this tub
for that price i feel like it should be able to st
didn't hydrate as much as i had hoped for this price point
i used it once
i really wanted this to be the miracle it claims to be
if new pimples keep popping up like they have been then i'll consider this a complete waste of money
i really thought this product would work for me because it had high reviews
thought this would be a great option
even though it said "immediate results" i decided to wait a week before i judged it
the main reason i got it was because it was a gel
i am planning on using the whole thing since it was expensive
i would say its too expensive for what it it
i think the ingredients must have been really strong to make my skin sting like that
it would be okay if it were a $20 product
definitely won't be replacing once i've run out
ultimately i did manage to use it up
because i couldn't force myself to use it more than a few times
since i try not to touch my face throughout the day regardless
because they will feel gross
i've never had any product do this to my face
thought that this product was simply average
never knew how much product to use
if i used too little it felt like i needed to add more
i will be returning this
walk away from this 1 because you have so many more options that are not only better
i just tried it today for some reason it makes my face sticky
i will comment back a week from today to see if it dose anything
really had high hopes for this oil
the more i used it
while they did get better
i will be returning it unfortunately.
i found that it didn't absorb well
i do use it with other products
t may just be reacting to the other stuff i use
i will use the rest of it
i will most likely try something else when i have finished with this
my skin said no so then i used it every other day
i feel the same way about a couple reviewers.
they seem to always push olehenriksen
i think it may be better as an night treatment coupled with an oil or something
it would always get into my eye
i really thought this would be a hit
thought this would be best suited for me
however i decided to use it again
tough that this was going to be way better than that product
not for the better
wish was little bit more richer
have not seen any anit-aging benefits at all
it did not meet my expectations at all
after trying it for 3 weeks i see no different on my lines
i will continue to use it as i have yet to find an eyecream to reduce my shadows
still no results at all
in fact it almost seems as though it brought them out more
since the majority were great reviews
first of all i think i used way too much on first try
this was not effective for me
what the sephora description does not tell you is that the box as well as the l'occitane website specifies it as being for normal to dry skin
never had any problem even if i put the cheapest one
thought that this might be worth a try based on other reviews
maybe i should have tried a different one of the 3 clay masks
this was supposed to be the most gentle
i've got other masks i like better so going back
i try a lot of products
may feel different for other people.
i can definitely find better masks out there
i won't be using that one again
no no for me after tried it once
the only beauty product that i've been so unhappy with that i took it back
if i have a breakout i will use it
i keep hearing good things about the tatcha line
just seems to disappear into the skin as if i had not applied anything at all
i can put almost any product on my skin
there is a lot of alcohol in this
not something i would think of as being in a product for "deep hydration"
there are many serums out there that are better.
definitely not- not with nearly 100
once again such pretty packaging from tatcha.
for $90, i expect to see some results.
was hoping for more of a difference.
not as brightening as is hoped for
almost a little too quickly
with this i failed to see any additional benefits
never react to any products
now i need to recover with all these red spots on my face
yet i still fight getting the product out
for this money i expect not only a good product
i will be taking it back.
it should definitely be in a bottle that you can get it out of easily
i will never know because this is the worst packaging ever
you can keep returning it
if they come out with a new dispenser
i will give it a second chance
the one star is simply for not being able to get the product out of the bottle
it was the same way
pound it until i can get the formula to come out
it will be tough to evaluate the benefits of this product as i don't anticipate being able to get much more of it out of the bottle
i've never experienced anything so cheaply done on a product
cannot say enough about the great results from many of their products
as many others have found
but i also did not find it to absorb.
saw no benefit of using them for the money i paid
i can only use this as a moisturizer if i plan to stay at home
two stars because you get a lot of product for the price
i am already having trouble pumping any more product out of the bottle
i do not see any major improvements to my eye area after using this product either
think that was likely due to a different product
it is supposed to be all natural
that have worked so much better
with a $46 price point i would hope for all natural
also one or even a half pump has a lot of product
by the end of the day my face is as red as can be
out in any way
haven't been using it for too long
you may not have to spend this much to get results
that said i'm not red all over.
some days i think this product is helping.
be careful if you are sensitive to alcohol.
actually it will make your skin more sensitive in long term :
which led to needing to use more of the $125 moisturizer than should have been necessary
find there are better creams at same price point
i expected a bit more from this
it did help to clear up any breakouts faster than normal
i dismissed it as it still seemed to be working
too expensive for no results.
so perhaps that is why
it looked as if there was not any product in the bottle
would neither separate nor budge at all
ordered this online and the pump did not work.
have tried several expensive ones
i explained to her that i have been using oil free products all of my life
the amount of oil that would build up on my face was gross
this makes me break out a lot after only one time use
even if i'm out being active
was hoping that this product would be a good st
will keep it for a full week to see if it does hydrate more
unfortunately it may be more of a product for combo skin
i think it would be ideal for those with normal to combination skin
unfortunately had to replace this cleanser with something else
my face actually felt even more dry after each use
not what i originally experienced with this particular one
i would never ever pay this much for this particular mask
my skin was not any different after i used it.
maybe if you are more on a normal side you will get better results
won't be using this any more
i wait a sufficient amount of time between my other skincare
as well as the fact that they are made in the usa
both which i like very much
i would not recommend this product at all.
this is within reach then i will still use it
like other reviewers have said
it also had a really
as so many of the other reviews say it's impossible to work with
this is possibly the worst product i've ever put on my face
i wish i could have my points back
unfortunately i will be returning this
perhaps this is best suited for someone younger?
expected this to be just as great
i stuck it out for a few days hoping that might give it some special moisturizing factor
that too felt short
i used it for about a week to give it a fair chance
like other people have said
as many others have mentioned it balls up
will return because it was 40$ in hopes of getting a different moisturizer that better suits me
very hard on face when applied
like many others the more i try to pat or work it in the more it balls up
however like many other people have said
i can't see it working out 2 well since it massively balls up
i tried applying different ways
the first time i tried a sample of this face cream i knew instantly that it was something special
i never put something in or on my body that i haven't researched thoroughly
i usually check reviews on here
as many other people have said
not many products have this effect on me
didn't absorb very well at all
will be going back to my biotherm aquasource gel moisturiser
this product was so-so
guess i'm not the only one has this problem after reading other reviews
this product might work for some people
i might still try some of farmacy's other products to see if they have potential
i need more results
i feel like i could get the same results for half the price
much more so than if i had used no moisturizer.
other than that it may not be the best product for a daily moisturizer
even thinking of buying two before even trying it
then decide is there has been improvement
i used this on
but will use it more and see.
when i used this
this is nothing more than a primer in a stick.
if you look closer in the mirror they're all still there
that being said, it isn't a bad product at all.
it might be a game changer come winter
got his thinking it would be gentle based on the reviews
was hoping things would change
i brought this with me overseas for the military because i wanted to travel with as few liquids as possible
the more i use it
i hoped that maybe it would work better in water
would feel differently against my skin than other soaps i've used in the past
after reading so many good reviews on this product i decided to give it a try to see if i could get a more balanced skin
two or three more big ones would pop up in its place
it does last a long time for those who actually do notice any benefits
it would have been so effective
it could work great for other people
even though it works for some
this is nothing like i've had before.
they were ones that hurt too
even though it says it is for acne be careful
though i do use it only at night
i really wanted to like this one from all the positive reviews
not what i expected in a $75 bottle of face oil!
it's too much of a gamble for me to buy these as i've had issues with both bottles
i used this for 4 weeks in order to give it a chance to work
not sure why my first review of this product never posted
for this reason i had to return it
over all i like that one more
this is the only one i couldn't continue using
i also found it somewhat irritating that i had to mix up the product very thoroughly every time i used it
i found that in order for this product to really be effective
maybe some people could
what made me initially interested
i got this mask because of the ongoing hype of both it
i couldn't return anything due to it being ordered from their website
i definitely would have
made sure i was using it the correct amount of times– i was
i would still recommend buying it just because out of all the reviews i've read it seems like it works for the majority
unfortunately, this was not the case.
i didn't even put it on for the full recommended time
ended up returning it before i could really experience any benefit
was hoping that this would help with the texture
maybe this product needs more time to actually show its claimed effects?
hopefully i'll see better results
if that is the case then this product is not any stronger than a daily exfoliator
i will be using it up because i paid $48 for it
i even have afeeling maybe some of these reviews are fake like they do with new br
i still did not find this to be an effective treatment
i would not recommend to those who may have more complicated acne
really hard to blend out then this would be a total holy grail for me
don't have the same additional concerns i do
wish it would come in a tube
maybe i'm not old enough to be using this product yet
it's something i've noticed in some of their other products too
either give us more product or cut down on packaging
if this same formula was made as a face cream that would be more suiting
was told by a dermatologist years ago that no products can actually lighten them
reading other reviews i had high hopes this was more effective than others on the market to improve texture around the eyes
just nothing compare to other products i have used in the past
you can use one of those
i should be able to control how much serum comes out
i would definitely return it if i were in the states
this one was just not for me
perhaps it should have been 2
i continued to apply it to my face thinking
"how long can the smell possibly last?"
since i knew what to expect from this cream
they were much better
i would expect a lot more from something so expensive
i still have all of the same bumps
it does seem to be lasting quite a long time
as someone who will try any well reviewed
i see here that there are other reviews about the smell
substituting it for something else to see which product was causing this
i will swear by every other product they have
so this migh be more beneficial for 30
am hoping my skin will recover
i feel like especially for the price you could get something better than this
it's not worth the fight so will be returning
more than 1 person said the same thing to me
i used this once.
so sadly this will be returned.
that wasn't the case at all
hoping i might be able to cut back to using it once every few days
will be returning it
was hoping it would help
needed something to help scaring
well, it's a mask which is different from others.
never had this happen before.
not sure why this didn't work at all for me since most people seem to have such good luck with it
so maybe it could be used for that purpose?
you can definitely find better in another line for this price
now can't take back as sephora has changed their returns policy
i found that i couldn't use it every day i would have to alternate it with something a little stronger to get off the dead skin built up
but that one is not working at all!!!!!!
very disappointed and will return!
i think it could be a good product
this product did none of that
it should be advertised as a shaving cream because that is what it is like
the more i used it the more my face seemed to break out
seems like this product would be better suited for someone with younger skin
the consistensy is different as we all know
feel like you have to use a lot of product each time you use it
this wasnt what i expected.
i do not see many results by way of cleansing
it does not take off all of your make up if you were to use it as a dual make up remover step
if you were to take off your make up before using this
tried it for a week and did not see any results.
i like to leave it on for a minute or so to see if any active ingredients can make a difference
it should really be used as a second step.
i also find the price to be a bit on the high considering how much product i have to use quite da can
find myself using more than i need just to have coverage
i doubt the bottle will last very long as i have been using a golf ball-sized amount each time
i wonder if the sheets are better
this is not that product
then by all means
t will last me a long time
this was not one of them
although the effects are not that long-lasting
feeling better than this did
something that really needs to be used everyday
i'll be trying some of this br
's other things since they do seem to have a good following
i hope the result will be nice
for something so expensive i expected it to last longer
i am happy with the results thus far
at times would end up with too much
for that reason i am giving this a 3 star because i feel that for such a pricey product the packaging needs to be fixed
it is almost as if they are using up old packaging for the serum
started using my other serum which i like a lot better
it might work for others just not for me.
i hoped it would work
got a sample of something different which i hope will work better
there are so many other great eye creams that are way better
like i said before
if this was $20 i might buy the full size to see if there's results after a longer period of time
however given the fact it is only 15 ml it doesn't last very long
the person that helped me at sephora recommended this one to help with my concerns over fine lines
i swear i now have some that weren't there before
tried to return, but they said it was full.
i will be returning.
...i read to give it 2 weeks to see results.
neither have been true.
as i think that the bottle doesn't seem to be completely full even upon arrival
would have hoped to see results a little faster
it did not help with any of my dark spots
which it says it will help all of those things
that i was hoping to lighten also
this has not lightened at all from what i can tell
as of now it has not worked
if possible, my eyes look worse than i started.
apparently only some people react well to this ingredient used to lighten spots
this was beyond anything
there are far better choices out there
my only hope was to reach for this
this is the first time i write a review at sephora here
the said they would take the product back
was told this product would definitely lighten them
i used up the whole bottle hoping it would get better
have wasted a lot of money
this didnt help lighten them what so ever
i wasn't expecting a big different from only one bottle
perhaps it needs longer to show results
trying out all kinds of expensive skin care if it works
if anyone has found a better product i would love to get something different because the scars are very embarrassing
i originally brought this product because makeupshayla said that it worked wonders for her
i don't break out very easily with new products either
i feel the need to warn people that this product destroyed my skin
why am i wasting my time using this serum with a questionable
see if it makes any difference later
i continued to use it in hopes that it would work over time
are still definitely there
i put in a lot of hope that this product would work
some bigger than others.
which is why i'm giving it 3 stars.
maybe this works for other skin conditions
or at least not mine
always use it for the minimun required time to see results
i assumed it would be a spot treatment however when i read the instructions after receiving it
which is a shame because i thought i found beauty products that include all people
such as others in the past
it may be a great product
as you see some of the one stars are mostly people with sensitive skin
we are all trying to find the perfect acne solution
there must be something in murad products that doesn't like my skin because i had the same reaction to the clarifying cleanser
unfortunately i was one of the few that this cleanser didn't really work well for
this helped lower them
i wanted to try an oil cleanser so this was my first time trying using one
probably should have returned it
i tried it for almost a week to give it a good review
i figured i'd try this because the price was more reasonable than the tatcha one
feel like i will go through a bottle very quickly
have to really work to spread it around
if it wasn't for the packaging would be 4 stars
i tried both this
neither worked for me
or just in general
the description isn't lying when it says that this is a maximum strength product so be careful
i will never use this again
so since i have combo skin i wanted to try this out
i've never had this happen before.
dry that i could never use this again
still have some uses
i try to stay as clean as i can with my h
if anything it made certain areas of my skin break out even though they were previously clear
i will say though
this 28$ cleanser did not make it any better or at least keep it at bay
my t zone is way more oiler than it already was
some days are better than others
it's difficult to say if this product is helping or hurting because i seem to have the same results with any other cleanser i use
at least someone is getting some use out of it
it has not prevented any acne from starting back up though which i would have hoped it would
i will continue to use it
i originally bought this product because of the review videos on youtube not realizing that it was making my skin worse
pros:left my face feeling cleancons:after using it for 2 months it did not help my acne at all
i would not recommend for sensitive skin at all.
but it had no benefits.
which overtime can make you break out even more.
unfortunately it made my skin break out terribly after just one use
barely used any of the product
'll be returning this product
this cause me to have horrible break out that i have never experienced before
i wish i had the good results others have reported
this will be a very rare return to sephora for me
while i felt that this product really did help to plump
there are way too many good skin care products to choose from
at first when i applied i was pretty hopeful this would be a good product
maybe it works differently on different skin
this is independent of whether i used a tiny bit or a little more
honestly, the drugstore ones are just as good.
do not be fooled by the positive reviews--they are probably fake
i really had high hopes for this
another problem i see is that this balm is just not worth the money
had the opportunity to try through a sephora favorites item over the holidays-bought specifically to be able to try this
have different products in my routine that do what this is supposed to do better at a less expensive price
there is not much in the jar for the price if used daily as intended
over all not a bad product
was i wanting more?
it felt like such a waste to put this on
now, like i said.
i might consider buying this in the winter months as a gift to myself or something of that sort
there are too many other balms that work better in my opinion
and, i did not see any useful results.
i will be returning this product.
i feel like the results are less than astonishing
i tried it 2 or 3 more times to see if it was just a coincidence
i'd rather have more control over the shimmer on my face instead of it being all over--especially since you could definitely see it if looking up-close
you have to be careful with this.
usually have to blot sooner than with this
didn't pay $66 for it because i would be even more upset
you could see the results immediately.
t would not be able to use this without using another product to prime my skin
initially i was excited bc i do love one of their serums however when i used it this morning prior to makeup application it was apparent that it was just too much for my oily skin
overlooked the price this one time believing this product could work for my skin--not
i will never buy this product again even if it was 100 or 200 dollars there were no good results out of this
i usually have really good luck with her recommendations
there are other products that are better for a better price
i'll try to work with it more
will be returning soon.
love the product wish the packaging was better would like pump not brush on the end
this is in no way better then the regular primer.
it is almost impossible to get the product out.
didn't particularly feel any different than the regular primer
nor did it seem like i had better results with the nuface tool
i might have kept it
so while you are trying to dispense product
maybe if they fix the packaging i might try it again to see if the gold formula is really better than the original primer
they still need to work on this one for it to be so$$$
it's the same as the other
which did many things for my skin
if you are going to spend that kind of money on a luxe product try the balm as opposed to this
i do not normally spend this much on one make up product
it had a lot of time to work
