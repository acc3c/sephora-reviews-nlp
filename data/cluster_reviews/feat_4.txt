with consistently clogged pores
i mix the korres wild rose oil
smoothing any remaining texture
and no breakouts like with other oils.
my skin is so smooth resulting in a better makeup application
plus the oil absorbs so quickly
and then slowly increased to daily.
it has cleared breakouts
along with using good genes
goes throughout my cycle
this oil actually helps unclog the pores so whatever is in them can work its way out without causing acne
unless my skin is extra troublesome
other ones to counteract the drying effect of those ingredients
it does absorb slowly into my skin
3-4 drops is plenty enough to spread across the face
which i am in the process of re-ordering now: paula's choice 2% bha skin perfecting fluid
my pores are smaller
subsequently helping reduce any texture on my nose
using this mask itself is an experience in itself
the packaging is heavy
needs to be applied evenly
the other mask absorbs/works better
the texture is similar to a jam
i apply a thin layer
it does have a different texture
i've used a lot of brightening mask
i would not use it for summer because of the stickiness
it doesn't just boost the vibrancy of you skin
it also boosts your mood too
fresh skin is revealed every use
goes on very smoothly
this helps to actually revive
i've tried numerous high end masks
it spreads like jam
because you only need a thin layer of this mask
it has real pieces of citrus
it easy to apply and wash off.
it helps curb breakouts
also has a peeling effect
easy on the skin
it has chunks of the fruit in it
i don't typically go for all natural masks
the fresh rose mask
i didn't have any redness despite the high citrus fruit content
most of them are regarding the stickiness
excessive dryness around my t-zone
the fruit complex in this really helped with my texture
you do need to use a wash cloth in aiding with removal just like the directions state
it makes it easier to remove
this product revives your skin.
tried other firming products.
the product is light
it is so light weight
the packaging is very sanitary
well balanced for people with oily to combination skin like mine
prevent new acne from appearing
also balances the overall tone/ texture of skin
it even takes off mascara effortlessly
i don't notice it after the product absorbs into my skin
where i want extra luminosity
like all of our 100% natural products
while a diamond dust mineral blend adds a soft luminescence when worn over the entire face or over makeup for highlighting
natural scent can take some adjustment
you can rest assured the nontoxic fragrance is proof of the highest quality natural technology working to reveal soft
poor pump bottles etc
like all of our 100% natural products
containing 29 high performance ingredients
improves skin’s appearance while instantly illuminating the look of the eye area
my skin tone medium
split it between both eyes
i've used every green br
through out the day my oil in manageable
face masks often on for a while
this solves that problem!
because any product with sake in it really smooths it out
because it runs out quickly
it peels off easily
then add a thicker layer
i applied it on the parts of my face that needed brightening
taking care of all your skin issues simultaneously
as it dries it tightens really well
this peels off easily
it has sodium pca which helps retain moisture
i would like some essential oils in there
it blends in immediately
it goes in smooth
absorbs quickly into the skin
it also claims to help chisel the contours of the face
it smooths on like a dream
wait for it to absorb a bit
which reflects light off of my hereditary dark circles
my makeup rests on it nicely.
apply that foam to your face
my pores also seemed more refined.
i recommend this for its calming
as they appear more refined especially right after i cleanse with this
my skin seems to respond well to it
it has a very effective formula with tea tree that deep cleans
this cleanser has been reducing my breakouts all while not irritating my skin
clearing acne when it does occur
the other drug store products i was using was stripping my skin of its nutrients therefore my skin ended up producing more oil to over compensate for the loss
using in combination with the problem solution toner
alternating the oil control moisturizer in the day
it appears to help dome with adult acne.
my pores are also shrinking.
it also absorbs quickly its more moisture then the belif aqua bomb i noticed
it is super light and fast absorbing.
this works well as a second cleanser
it does a solid job on dissolving makeup
great for neutralizing redness and easy to use.
the magnetized lid that holds the spatula is very innovative
"more nourished along with an increase in moisture" or "a clearer complexion"
this helps clear it
i feel like my pores are smaller
this mask is the bomb.
i've used many different masks that claim to hydrate
as i've continued to use the mask
i alternate this with a clay mask
i like to use this mask in conjunction with my clay based mask
softening the kp bumps
product delivers on all claims.
this mask fixes it all
definitely helps reduce redness
applied to skin in a circular motion
this mask saves my skin every time
i like the heating feature
farmacy is starting to slowly grow into my 'favorites' for troubled skin
you have to massage in the mask to activate the heat
this helps compensate for both of those
it is not a revolutionary face mask
it is easy to apply to skin
the pores look smaller
it helps decrease breakouts
it reduces the swelling immediately
because the mask transforms into a cream
this helps with fine lines as well
the application is smooth
it is comparable to a deep conditioning mask.
perfect mask to use 1x per week.
seemingly pore-less skin
it changing consistency turning into a mask
overall effective for both hydrating
the description doesn't like this as reducing redness
the magnetic lid for the scoop tool to sit when not in use
this mask manages to add moisture to my skin
eyes creams absorb much faster the day after this mask
balanced my combination skin to normal
it also calms breakouts
which is so much more hygienic than dipping fingers into the jar regularly
on top of all that it is anti-aging!!
it was a simple cleanse
it has no scent that i can detect washes off easily
plump immediately after using this
fix all my skin problems
which just makes my skin go into overdrive producing more oil
it effectively cleanses my skin
this product goes well with the max complexion pads as well as the acne spot treatment
it either broke me out or wasnt effective for brightening my acnce scars or preventing outbreaks
ptr is such an effective brand.
it is non-dry, non-irritating etc.
the sulfur-based one
dramatically shortens the life of the zit
the packaging says to apply a thin layer
it drastically reduces stubborn
i've had mixed result with sulfur as ingredient in the past
i like this product for use on intact skin acne breakouts
peeling than other products designed to use for the same skin problems
then again the main ingredient is sulfur
decreasing the size of pores as well
works great for minimizing pimples overnight.
i've used it without makeup to brighten up a natural look
this milk cuts through makeup
if i'm using it to remove makeup
since this remover isn't inexpensive
delicate currently from medical treatments i am receiving
is great for using before applying a cream/liquid based or cream stick foundation
it gets all of the excess oil off
mild reactive acne have significantly improved with it
my skin is more firm
absorbs right into the skin
plump after makeup takes it toll
i love natural products that work
helps prevent excess oiliness associated with dehydration
helping minimize fine lines
soften those less-than-fine-lines
a smooth surface for applying makeup
tightness was a non-issue
then add the wild rose oil on top for more hydration
rub a bit of water in to activate it
as ren has become a part of my daily routine
i've added this into my already simplified routine
massage into skin in a circular motion until absorbed
it does have a strong fragrance while applying
instantly plumps it up
its water activated which i love.
first it's a natural eco-conscious br
it works with water
will fit seamlessly into any morning routine
how firming it is
needed something easy to pack
a sephora salesperson recommended for me to achieve firm skin without drying
cleans great without stripping skin of oils.
i feel like i'm on a cloud
this quickly removes every speck of makeup from my face
it removes all of my face and eye makeup.
after doing some extensive research i found this cleanser
yet it strips all the oils
this product really removes dirt
this one removes the most makeup
they soothe skin that is hurting
even the tissue around the magnet could not keep product away from it
the magnet removal thing has gotten kind of annoying
i keep losing the magnet
when you don't wrap the magnet properly the mask gets on the magnet
then i remove with a magnet
i did learn to double wrap the magnet with tissue
i actually prefer to use it flat with the triangle parallel to my skin rather than using the edge like a razor
remove using the magnet in a double wrapped tissue
smoother since using this product
i preferred to spread with my fingers.
fun and easy to remove with the magnet.
it is difficult to clean the product off the magnet
i love the removal process
all of my other products soak in so easily
not only do i love the magnet removal part
ageing skin is coming fast
blurs those tiny lines
plus, no pore clogging!
the magnet was fun to use
it is essential for any skin over 40+
can be a bit time consuming with the small magnet
the magnetic triangle is very easy to use
they include the spatula to help smooth product into skin
take off the bulk of the mask
leaves enough of the softening ingredients on your face that you can still rub it in to continue the softening/plumping effect
the benefits of the mask is not pulling out impurities from your pores unfortunately from a magnetic
it is a bit tedious using the small magnet to take it off
it applied very smoothly.
it is easy to remove
love the ease of use
i agree to use a paper towel instead of a tissue because the tissue isn't strong enough
i'd recommend using strong paper towel instead of tissue the magnet is so strong that it may rip though tissue
would a magnetic mask really work?
i struggled applying a thin layer with the spatula that was included with the deluxe sample
fine lines are reduced
it really gets it cleanly off
it smooths out textures
i only have to use 1 tissue
it is so much fun removing the mask with the magnet
it is so cool removing the mask with the magnet
the mask magically comes off with the magnet.
the magnet is a fun addition to my evening skin care routine
twice for mature skin
the magnet actually pulls the mask off your face
the mask complemented her already nearly-perfect skin
using a magnet to draw out the impurities
why is it necessary to have a magnetic mask
gets oily as the day progresses
we all had a great time magnetically taking it off each other's faces
the magnet removal process is fun/ exciting/
removing the mask with the included magnet felt amazing
i wiped the magnet off when the mask buildup became cumbersome
i've used many different facial masks
ofc it has iron iron is what makes it stick to the magnet
my big tip is to use a soft cotton wipe instead of a tissue over the magnet to remove
that magnet really works to pull the product off the skin
this mask claims to tighten
work to deal with aging concerns
removal was so easy
if you lost the magnet
apply a light layer on skin
use the magnet inside of a tissue to remove
the real star of the show is the magnet you use to pull the mask off
the look, the box, the magnet!!
the way the product is removed is amazing with the super cute magnet
gave my skin a smoothing effect
this mask has a cooling effect that provides a relaxing experience
quickly calms red patches on my face
had a hard time applying the mask evenly
this system is easy to use
of course without the extractions
the package states that it sets quickly
low for up free mask
and the fine lines are all but invisible.
the finer lines have been minimized
salicylic didn't unclog my congested skin
this cleaners actually cleans all my eye makeup without using a separate eye makeup remover for it
my pores are smaller
my dark spots are fading quickly
this cleanser has helped combat my excess oil
i find that this helps temporarily reduce redness after ever wash
in addition to being clean

this actually does a good job at counteracting the red
this multi stick delivers

so my review is from the perspective of a non foundation wearer :
i've used this as a primer under liquid foundation
the stick glides on smoothly and blends easily.
flaws were disguised nicely
my pores were minimized
not past a natural look
i found this perfects the base completion
they blend together well with the pore stick
after i started blending it sort of magically blended in
blends very easily into the skin for a no makeup look
this is a great product for blurring pores
this product is great at blurring pores.
pours in a easy to travel with stick
plus i get a high spf
this product completely disguises every pore
it's light in weight
gives light coverage as well
it does take a while to absorb completely into the skin hence "overnight detox"
your skin is exposed to pollution all day that negatively affects the skin
the packaging is super sanitary which is a plus
it instantly mattes it
i'd rather use blotting papers for that.
this product is cooling as it goes on
its works on all skin types
this does a good job of eliminating the oil slick that covers my face by mid-day
setting spray on the market
urban decay's de slick spray
apply the perfector over makeup with the same puff
thanks to this i don't have to spend $500 on a laser treatment to close my oil producing pores
it actually helps blur the large pores on my nose
repurpose it as a household lubricant
is easy to use provided that you start lightly
way better than using blotting papers!
then touched up with a compact
my makeup is not disturbed when applying over my liquid foundation
wherever i apply stays matte for hours
setting spray on the market
the price is steep
like others, i've tried all the blotting options.
you can see the layer of oil
it makes my pores looks smaller
has a nice cooling effect upon application
this little bounce up compact eliminates all the cons of other methods
two drawbacks- some makeup transfer
with the makeup transfer even with continued cleaning of the murad pad
the only reason i gave it 4 stars is because since it is a thin liquid
the liquid also takes off some of the makeup
easy-to-use this cushion blotting perfector is
blended well with my complexion
i actually love the compact itself.
i prefer this over a traditional setting powder.
it has a cooling effect when you pad it onto your skin
this will reduce oil/shine on your face.
normally i will use a tissue paper
it does reduce pore size
setting powder etc my oil breaks through
my pores stay minimized
the liquid formula lends itself to a cooling feeling when applying
as swiping may likely remove foundation products
oil absorbing papers are temporary
this face mask does as it claims
it gave a cooling sensation
instant gratification with pores
definitely cools once on the skin
it is powered by the heat
the eye cream is just average
balanced when i use it
protect it from the sun
it absorbs pretty quickly

works well for my skin type
this is because it is mostly gel on the top.
it absorbs really quickly
i love that it absorbs quickly
i've also been using the un-concealer/foundation by rms beauty which really helps when applying together
pores are minimized after application
it goes on like whipped cream absorbs well
nothing preformed like this one
preforms beautifully under makeup
even other "natural" oils can hide behind fillers
skin was trying to compensate for lack of oils/moisture
one use of this instantly changes it
the argan reserve removes that feeling of sensitivity
using the 100% original argan oil
after using the argan reserve it is so hard to go back to the original argan oil
thereby upping people's expectations
which i normally would with regular argan oil
my skin is mostly normal
this oil is transformative for your skin.
it gives my foundation a smoothing boost
soaks in faster than regular argan oil
my skin absorbed it faster than the regular jm argan oil
rather than spreading smoothly
i also love it to boost any sheet mask or cream mask

ample enough for night time use when you need an extra boost of moisture
i normally use a heavy mask type moisturizer in the evening
open jars aren't sanitary
the ingredients break down more quickly when exposed to air
excellent anti-aging ingredients
the price tag is a bit steep
not in a heavy way
it helps quench my skin so that it does not produce extra oil to compensate
prone to adult break outs
night to control over production of oil
it goes on smoothly
great for nighttime use.
i made the switch from tidal
searched in my goody box for a heavier moisturizer than i typically use
when it was fully absorbed
despite being a rouge member
a prescription retinal which i alternate
my skin is rapidly recovering from all the treatments i've been doing
i reaaallyy wanted to like tidal

it also makes my makeup apply smooth and evenly.
with tidal, a little bit goes a long way.

sr products have transformed my skin.
i stopped using a primer because this make my foundation go on evenly

the consistency of the product
it covers my face
my makeup applied evenly with no patches

although it takes a couple minutes for my skin to absorb it
tight throughout the day
use good genes & tidal for daytime.
i've read a low ph of the skin
its thicker consistency has made it effective in protecting the dry areas on my face
while not causing breakouts on the more oilier areas

it is a completely different texture than tidal-much heavier
because for me the scents dissipate quickly
