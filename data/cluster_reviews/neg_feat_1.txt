however i'd be willing to sample other glam glow masks
it makes my hair stick to my face
it's great to use to clean your makeup brushes with
i also didn't apply makeup that day
would have to wait to apply my makeup
i didn't bought it to have to put makeup over it
it's beautiful under makeup
i noticed that days when i didn't wear any eye makeup
it works best when i put it on a while before makeup application
it isn't good to layer makeup over it.
had to remove all the product
it's an amazing way to prep before makeup on a special occasion
the customer was wearing a lot of makeup
for one thing if you try putting makeup on top of it
it helps your hair as well
it says apply on clean skin
if you try to put makeup on over it the makeup beads up
depending on your makeup
i really like the repair wear laser focus
she applied it on my skin during a mini facial
it cleans out everything all right
won't remove all your makeup --
if you plan on not wearing any makeup on top of this product
the cream rubs off easily with or without makeup.
way worse with makeup.
was ever worse under makeup
use another face cream instead
especially not under makeup
it made my face sweat under the mask
this product does remove my make-up
or if i wear makeup as it does get all the paint off
seems to remove most of the makeup
plus it didn't remove the makeup as good as the essential c cleanser by murad
the mask feels good on the face when applying it
removed all my makeup
it made my makeup melt off of my skin
i used this to wash my face with
not good to wear under makeup.
it never let my makeup set: my foundation
particularly when i wear makeup
i tried it under makeup
did not perform very well under makeup
i wouldn't ever use it over makeup
makes makeup apply unevenly on top
show up under makeup
forget trying to layer makeup on over it.
i tried it under makeup
tried it alone without makeup
hate putting on under makeup because it leaves my blemishes dried out
the masks work great on their own.
just wash your face
put your mask on
then apply the mask
i usually don't use a primer before i put on my face masks
i tried this mask primer with 2 different masks
they are not just a makeup br
i don't wear makeup
this facial wash did not get any of the dirt or makeup hardly off
didn't removed my makeup
i do love how this one removes all my makeup
did a great job at removing makeup though.
i dont wear very much makeup
it still did not remove all my eye makeup
it also left all my makeup stuck on my face wash brush even after i tried to wash the brush with the face soap
just average about getting your face free of all makeup
i will keep using my baby soap to remove all makeup
i tried using this in the morning when i didn't even have makeup to remove
this oil does not remove mascara completely
while it removed makeup well
it works well as a makeup remover
because i love the makeup
the old cleanser was great for removing my eye makeup even if that was its intended purpose
did not remove all of my makeup
still had makeup on after a good scrub
it definitely doesn't remove eye make up all that well
some times i wipe my face with a cleansing wipe
assumed that was because i'd had to keep rubbing my face to remove the cleanser
my hair will literally get stuck to it if i do not apply makeup over
stays as oilslick on your face
can't wear makeup over this product
i didn't wear any makeup
maybe they created this for people who don't wear under eye concealer
i'll use this before my make up including face primer
unfortunately each time i was done applying my face makeup
just not compatible with makeup.
it removed my facial makeup ok
had trouble with my waterproof eye makeup
i got this oil to remove my makeup before my actual cleanser
i would only use this cleanser as a morning cleanser because it doesn't really do the trick for before bed if you do wear makeup
it removes my makeup
if you don't wear eye makeup
or don't use an oil to remove it
doesn't interfere with makeup
i don't think it performs well under makeup
causes any makeup i put on top of it to ball up
make sure you allow plenty of time for the product to absorb into your skin before applying makeup
it was still to much for me when i wore sheer makeup
it can be used with or without makeup.
want my face to breathe without all the makeup
make it adjust w my skin
do not use under makeup
doesn't sit well under makeup
i wouldn't suggest using it under makeup
when i put makeup on
layers well under makeup.
i will just use it as a face wash
everytime i tried to use this product under eye makeup it looks dry
i don't wear makeup.
it wears off really quickly
it removed makeup well
though when i wear heavy makeup
wasn't the best at removing makeup
i also do need to take off my makeup with micellular water prior to washing because even though i use it as directed
it does not remove all of my makeup unless i remove it before cleansing
just for everyday wear
it's too heavy to wear under makeup
my makeup did not sit well on top of it.
the shine while using highlighters without making it more of a challenge with this lotion will just stick with what is working for me
balls up so bad if i try to wear it under makeup
it's not good under makeup.
goes well with makeup
i do find that this takes off any remaining residue or mascara
it does get the bits of makeup off i miss with my cleanser though
would be gorgeous under makeup
i can't use every morning because if under makeup
have a little glow without putting makeup on
i put this on under makeup
or if i wear this without makeup it still feels a little dry
it does not improve the longevity of my makeup
i don not approve
in fact, it made my makeup look awful.
as a primer it only works for the initial flawless application of makeup
erasing my makeup only 3-4 hours after
my makeup did not stay on well:
not as a makeup primer
it holds your makeup in place all day
my makeup does go on smoothly when using this
i wore it under my makeup
help keep my makeup in place
i also tried it with no makeup
my makeup gets all messed up
didn't take off makeup when applied over
it actually took off my makeup
i applied it before makeup
also tried applying on top of makeup when my face turned shiny
stayed well under makeup
makeup can be applied easily over it without slipping
i also cannot wear this underneath makeup for that reason
had a makeup artist try this on me during a makeover
this feels like you are putting shaving cream on your face
wearing it under makeup just makes it melt off my face sooner
i don't wear foundation
until u try to apply makeup over it
i cannot wear it under makeup as the only thing it illuminates are my pores
it works well under makeup to create a smooth base
i used it alone under makeup
i always like to try new face washes.
f you are not putting makeup over it
however, it is terrible under makeup.
it made the makeup peel in little chunks of makeup
doesn't blur or work as a primer.
my makeup looking wrong
i would not use this product during the daytime with or without makeup
takes my makeup with it
made my makeup wear in a way that i didn't care for
i think it's time to start applying a primer for longer lasting makeup wear because this isn't cutting it
i've noticed that every time i wear it under my makeup
my makeup doesn't last as long
my makeup goes on great over top of it
i wore no makeup cause i wanted to test it out first
kept my makeup from lasting
once i apply my makeup
used it in the morning under my makeup
i wore this moisturizer on a day i knew i was gonna be wearing makeup to see if it helped keep my oils at bay
its fine to use before makeup or as a nightime product
especially if i will be putting on makeup
i need to constantly blot my face all day when i wear it
causing my makeup to come off
keep in mind that i used this after removing all makeup with my favorite makeup wipes
i think it took off every little hair on my face
it didn't remove half of my makeup
this however is not a good makeup remover
this product works best after you remove your make up with a cleansing cloth first
does not absorb - makes makeup peel off.
it makes my makeup peel off
when i went to put on other makeup such as blush
it was ineffective at removing my makeup especially around the eyes
effective at removing makeup
does not remove eye makeup!!!!
i wanted to use this before makeup application
on days i didn't wear makeup
on days i wore makeup
using this product i got about 4 hours of intact makeup
it didn't look great under my makeup
when used under makeup it makes my foundation break up
it isn't completely mattifying as the makeup forever primer
it leaves a film on your face to when you put your makeup on it looks cakey
it definable takes off all my makeup in my opinion
i still found some makeup would come off after using cleansing water
it does not take makeup off
i applied it before putting on my makeup before work
shortens the wear time of my makeup significantly
the mask doesn't work at all!
this would be a good mask for right before applying makeup for a night out
it was easy to apply, and remove.
it's not very good for removing makeup.
this is more like gentle face wash for mornings not for removing a full face makeup
i find that i have to use a face wipe beforeh
this product didn't remove my makeup at all
it definitely does not remove my mascara
i tried this on the recommendation of a sales associate after i told her i wanted a face cleanser that also truly removed makeup
it didn't do the greatest job at removing the makeup
honestly the cleanser works fine to remove make up on its own
washes off my waterproof eye makeup
if it doesn't even remove makeup
would be good for taking off minimal makeup.
it makesmy face looking dirty after i use the tool to take off the product
i didn't feel any "effects" while wearing the mask
need to wash my face
beginning to remove the mask
not to mention, takes forever to remove.
upon removal it was messy
while it is "fun" to remove the product like your face is an etch a sketch
the fun part is to remove it -- you could feel that the mask is pulled from your face
if you are trying to use it to remove your makeup
it takes 2-3 times to get my makeup off.
it takes off my makeup semi easily
the video showed how it covered up blemishes flawlessly
so the product removes makeup pretty well.
this stuff really removes makeup without double washing your face
this is more like an oil based remover that you wipe off
it's great at cleaning all types of makeup.
effortlessly takes off stubborn makeup
it didn't remove my eye makeup
it did a great job on my face makeup
it wouldn't get off all of my eye makeup
this product works well to remove makeup
it really does remove makeup
even stubborn eye makeup
it absolutely does remove makeup
it even takes off the makeup that is long lasting
isn't great for eye makeup
it removes make-up well
when i was done i had raccoon eyes that i still had to use eye makeup remover for
while it did take off all traces of my other makeup off
doesn't help makeup application in fact sometimes it made my face feel like i had halloween makeup on
washed my makeup off
my makeup wasn't going on smoothly on top of it
my makeup would separate
i can wear foundation with it
makeup didn't last long
it didn't extend the wear of my makeup or control oil at all
it does help hold up my makeup.
didn't remove my makeup
it was as though i was putting my makeup over bare
i can wear it under makeup because it isn't greasy
you can't wear this under makeup it just doesn't look right
makeup product works differently for each person
definitely not good to use under makeups
maybe the only reason it has the effect of color correcting is because it goes on like kabuki makeup
i liked the idea of substituting this for my sunscreen everyday to work since i don't wear make up
didn't want to wear a ton of makeup
since i don't wear makeup to work except for a little concealer when i need it
trying to see how it works with no makeup
as i really do not like to wear a full face of makeup on an every day basis
still cover like makeup
i wore this with no makeup
everything that touches your face will have some tan transfer
did not look great under makeup
it made my makeup slide around
it does not wear well under makeup.
i wore it underneath my foundation the same way as any other primer i used
i also work during the day with a dental mask
this makeup remover works pretty well
'm sticking with my usual dior makeup melter
it's literally the worst thing i've ever used to remove makeup
it doesn't remove everything
this product does a decent job of efficiently removing all types of makeup without clouding your eyes
boscia makeup melter melted zero makeup on my face i was pulling at my face the whole time
definitely recommend their makeup breakup cleansing oil over this
stick w the boscia makeup breakup cleansing oil.
you have to use a ton to get off even the lightest makeup
and it did not remove all of my mascara.
it doesn't do much in removing makeup or clean my face
it seemed to take off all my makeup
definitely helps to remove make up
it removes my makeup
didn't take all of my makeup off
i do not wear a full face of makeup often so most of the time i just use makeup remover wipes
take you're makeup off
this even took off my too faced better than sex waterproof mascara with no problems
when i do wear a full face of makeup i will be using this to take it off
it took off my makeup
although it removed all of my makeup
it did not remove my mascara well.
this product effectively takes off all my makeup at the end of the day
long-wear make up
this make up remover feels great on my skin
it removed the makeup from my skin
i still had to use an oil-based makeup remover on my eyes after
it did not completely take off my mascara
after i wash my face with this
all of your makeup is removed
my white brush head is covered in makeup afterwards
it just takes to much work to remove your makeup.
it did do a good job of removing my makeup
the powder finish in the product looks fantastic if you don't need to put any makeup over it
it does not do well under makeup
time to wash this crisco off of my face...
it did not work so well under makeup
i usually let a cleanser take my makeup off
i find the oil is great for makeup removal
i don't wear makeup so maybe if it would be ok under makeup
my makeup looked terrible
removes all make-up.
it removed most of my makeup
while i found that it did remove all of my makeup
how it removes my makeup
while not stripping it
the system together does remove my heavy eye make up pretty well though
after reading reviews i decided to remove my eye makeup prior to washing my face
everything else took all my makeup off
the oil part of this cleansing set worked well at removing my makeup
especially my hard to remove eye makeup
the oil removed my makeup just as most oils.
i don't usually use oil or soap to remove my makeup
i'll stick to using my wipes to remove my makeup.
the oil however doesn't really remove makeup.
it does melts all my makeup on my face
it doesnt do anything to remove all my makeup
definitely does remove makeup
this product removed makeup very well.
i don't feel the urge to use lotion right after however it did not remove makeup very well
you have to lose a large amount for it to begin to break up the makeup
it does remove makeup well
i put the mask on
it takes off most of my makeup
not all eye makeup
it does take of my makeup okay
just light enough to wear under makeup
i don't wear foundation
looks great under makeup
didn't leave a smooth skin for makeup
i applied it to my face clean
with no other makeup
it says that you can use it as a highlighter on top of makeup
it removed my makeup
i removed some of it
rest of the face looks beautiful under makeup.
it took two makeup wipes to get it all off my face
it does nothing to add a glow to your makeup
wanted to use it as a moisturizer before putting my makeup on
the glitter doesn't show through
the glitter would not come off
i apply it to my face
the glitter would not come off
then sat with makeup remover wipes
applying it again below eyes over makeup end of day is difficult to blend
i think it would be best used underneath makeup
might look nice under makeup
i like that it doesn't pill when applying makeup over it
it's great for under makeup
doesn't ball up under my makeup
can't use it during the day or under makeup etc
it still makes for a terrible base for makeup
makes me want to take my makeup off.
did nothing to help the longevity of my makeup
when i try putting makeup on it
it's not effective as a makeup primer
i even looked good without makeup when i wore it
if i wear it without makeup
if anything i have to put more moisturizer on before putting my makeup on just to keep my face from peeling
and my makeup was a mess!
i tried makeup on right after application
my makeup lasts way longer with other primers
when i tried using it under makeup it made my foundation look cakey
however it made my makeup
neither one gets all of my makeup off
also it takes a lot to take off your makeup.
as it doesn't remove makeup as well as the micellar water
it doesn't work particularly well at getting makeup off
i definitely need to follow up with a double-cleanse or at least a make up remover
you're better off getting remover wipes.
i need it for taking off my eye makeup
i do try to cement said eye makeup to my face
it was ok for removing face makeup
does not work for removing mascara
struggles to remove my non-waterproof eye makeup
it cleans most makeup well
it doesn't remove most of the eyeliners i own
just means i have to use eye specific makeup remover first
i wear makeup easily less than 1/3 of days
bought specifically to wear under makeup
wear away in a messy way
unless i want to wear it on days that i wear moisturizer only
made my makeup stay in tact all day long
i wanted to use this under my makeup
helps foundation wear all day
the makeup lasts all day
will "pill" with or without makeup
i feel like this primer helped keep my makeup on my face longer
i can wear this while excersicing
under makeup it is wretched
it removes all the foundation
it does remove some makeup
it does nothing for me when applied before makeup
i tried this stuff under my makeup
on top of my makeup
it took my makeup off
toilet seat covers to get rid of some of the shine on my face
there was a mattefied effect right after i applied my makeup on top of it
it removed my makeup
doesn't work well with makeup
if u are a makeup wearer beware.
if i don't put makeup on afterwards
doesn't remove all of my makeup in three pumps as it suggests
i always have to follow up with other cleansers just to remove makeup
i would wash my face with this
great at removing all my makeup
assumed it would gently remove any residual eye makeup
at the same time remove my makeup
is able to remove most of my makeup
when i started to apply my makeups
wears great under makeup
i don't wear primer
after a few hours my makeup wears like it usually does
t definitely did a good job keeping that area matte for my makeup for a while
it does help my makeup last longer on a typical day
i used it maybe 10 times under makeup
i am not sure how to incorporate it into my makeup routine
i only recommend this if no makeup is worn on top
i personally prefer to wear this on the days were i dont wear makeup
tried it before my makeup
supposingly the makeup on top look totally flawless
not great with makeup overtop
if i apply it under my makeup sometimes it will break up
save it for more makeup free days
definitely for use over your makeup!
used over my makeup it definitely did smooth over my pores
made my makeup patchy
this cleansing oil was awesome- removes makeup well
it does a good job of removing makeup
pros: great at taking off all of my makeup.
making a nice base for makeup
lastly i will put this eye cream on
it looks bad under my makeup
it also didn't work well under makeup or concealer no matter how long i allowed the product to set into my under eye area
this cleanser removed all the makeup
if only it took off all of my eye makeup.
don't plan on putting makeup on right away.
it wore well under makeup
i scrubbed my face to make it wasn't me
the effect does wear off
mainly that you think it is more like skin care versus makeup
it reminds me of makeup i used on the 90's
it's a good makeup primer
with or without makeup
that it did make makeup go on smoother
makes removal of the lipstick easier
after i put my makeup on
did not help my makeup go on smoother
it simply is only some kind of oil to wear under makeup
this product works well as a makeup primer
it does work nice as a primer too for makeup!
i also used this product as a primer before makeup application
the results of my post-makeup look
looks great under makeup
it grabs all your makeup
alsodid nothing for my makeup as a primer.
helps with my makeup application
it kept my makeup looking okay
it didn't prolong my makeup at all
the unicorn title fits it because my makeup turns into a unicorn after i wear it
my makeup fails to exist just like a unicorn when i wear this primer
don't notice difference with makeup application
didn't do anything to my skin or appearance of makeup
my makeup kind of just melted off.
it does not fill pores or make my makeup stay on longer
this product did not remove my makeup very well.
this product does melt away all of your makeup
this took off my face makeup easily
it did nothing for my eye makeup
you might want to use a separate eye makeup remover with this
it didn't remove my makeup so what's the point
the makeup it left behind
it easily removes eye makeup as well as waterproof mascara which is impressive
does removes everything as intended
it's almost like applying a mattifyng primer to the face
the new formula leaves a white film on top of your skin
when you put it on it removes any oily spots on your face
causing your promer/makeup application to look horrible
i don't even wear heavy make up
it coudn't remove the mascara not once
yet it removes less than half of my makeup
then another makeup remover
don't expect to use this to remove a full glam make up look
the product description said it would remove makeup
apply without tearing it
keep smoothing it out for it to work
directions say you can remove mask when done
after removing the mask my skin did feel tighter
the mask does wear easily over the serum it comes with to allow for ample time to absorb
the mask does wear easily over the serum it comes with to allow for ample time to absorb
it did not wear under makeup well either
this oil is great at removing all my makeup
it was impossible to wear it under makeup because it didn't get absorbed
it also wears well under makeup.
while it does remove makeup
didn't even remove my makeup
if used to remove eye makeup
removed my makeup easily
which doesn't help to remove mascara
the cap is the same as the one on the umbria sunscreen
found it took off her makeup much better than her normal cleanser
it removed all my makeup
this does an okay job removing most makeup- only some difficulty with eye makeup which is to be expected
i removed most of my eye
it didn't remove my makeup well
the directions say it will remove eye makeup
this is supposed to be a makeup remover
it works nicely to remove make-up
it couldn't even take off my makeup.
this cleanser is great for someone who doesn't wear makeup
wouldn't recommend for someone who wears makeup
it doesn't remove much of it
had to use another makeup remover to remove my mascara
it doesn't remove my makeup well
it was hard to remove makeup with it
it's fantastic at removing a full face of makeup
except for something to remove mascara
removes make up well
that's almost $3 per face wash
it doesn't remove makeup all that well either
especially if you are applying this prior to makeup application
when applying the mask
does a fantastic job at removing makeup- one
not as effective as i had hoped in removing makeup
if i put it on after i take off my makeup
it helps to remove shine
use this after to lessen the shine
it would definitely not work in an am skincare routine unless you don't plan on wearing makeup
it does do a decent job removing makeup
especially more stubborn makeup
my makeup looks horrible
i need something that i can wear all day along with makeup
when applying to my face
it didn't take my makeup off well
i think it does a great job at removing makeup
wear makeup on a daily basis this may not be the best product
doesn't remove my eye make-up easily
i tried it before my makeup
when put your makeup on
i tried wearing it under makeup
makeup etc i noticed my t-zone became oily within 1/2hr of putting on my makeup
sat well under my makeup
applied makeup over it it did not stay on well
it doesn't seem to affect my makeup at all
it peeled off as i tried applying my makeup
hard to apply on the face
my makeup would not stay on my face after using this as a moisturizer
my makeup was all over my h
primer for my make up
i think that it would be best to use at night i work with makeup all the time being a freelance makeup artist
makeup consultant recommended this for my dry skin
love the face wash
their make-up wipes
i found it very frustrating to wear with makeup
on the search for my ddf erase eye gel
my makeup goes on smoothly
i love their face wash
this product does not even remove the daily oil buildup on my skin let alone makeup
wow this doesn't do a great job at removing makeup
the product doesn't remove make up
however it does not remove my makeup at all
does not remove makeup
i do not use any waterproof makeup products
this still did nothing to remove makeup
i specifically requested a cleanser that removes makeup
it just does a fair job of removing my makeup
it didn't remove makeup on a very light day.
it barely takes off any makeup from the face.
that would remove make-up
i can see some makeup coming off
takes too long to remove all makeup.
i feel there's makeup left on my skin even after wiping my face five times
even if i go over my face with a makeup remover prior to using this product
may work for those who don't wear makeup?
except that it did not remove all of my makeup
does not remove make up or even just residual residue after i've already removed the make up with another cleanser
its not very effective at removing makeup very well
when i wear make up
it removes makeup but it's not really special.
it didn't remove make up well
doesn't remove make up very well
also wears nicely under makeup- no peelies.
makeup goes on top well
it doesn't go well under makeup unless i apply the makeup an hour later or so
once i put on my makeup
some reviews say it works well under makeup
i remove my makeup using tatcha cleaning oil beforeh
i still have to remove all my makeup with a makeup remover
i needed a new face wash
i like that it removes mascara relatively well
it took me multiple washes to get rid of my makeup
decided to use them on a trip to remove makeup
as someone with oily skin who wears makeup
it is good enough for the amount of makeup i use.
advertises as "removes makeup"
i just use it in the am when i'm not wearing any makeup
i do not want to put anything like hair color chemicals on my face
but it is a good makeup remover.
pulls makeup away like a charm
it doesn't remove my makeup
i think this cleanser is best suited for individuals with normal skin who wear little to no makeup at all
yes it removes stubborn makeup
it does a great job removing makeup
if you need something to remove makeup
if i wash my face with my makeup still on
especially if you wear makeup
it definitely does not remove mascara
i still needed to use an eye makeup remover after i washed my face with this
i do not wear makeup every day
can't attest to its makeup removing powers
it left plenty of makeup on my face
i would recommend the murad clarifying wipes instead
it's not very good with makeup removal
this is after i use a makeup removing wipe on my face
good under makeup as well.
i found it difficult to layer makeup over this product
when i apply it after washing my face
not enough to go without makeup
then as the day wears on
i like how this cleans my face however
try applying it to your face
have to wash my face again
to remove my face makeup
it does remove a small makeup
it didn't really remove lighter makeup such as a cc
after washing the mask off of my face
then applying it in your face
it doesn't remove makeup whatsoever
however, it does not remove makeup well at all.
it also claims makeup removal
it didn't remove any of my eye makeup
remove makeup as long as you use a generous amount
i don't like that it does not remove eye makeup.
does not take off makeup even a little.
it is horrible with eye makeup
even though i use eye makeup remover before washing my face
make my skin makeup ready
makeup doesn't blend at all when used along with this product
i only recommend this if you're not wearing makeup
i can put a primer on
could keep wearing it
one day without any makeup
just made my face look like a clown that got its makeup melted off
it made my makeup melt off within a couple hours
it also is causing my makeup to shift.
have a clean slate to prep my skin for makeup
it looks good under makeup
which also made makeup application a little uncomfortable
didn't work well under makeup at all
it doesn't remove makeup properly especially waterproof eye makeup
then i apply my primer.
be a good primer for my makeup
my goal was to use this products to remove my makeup at night as well as to treat my combination skin
it did wash my face
i only use it at night because it looks extra greasy even under makeup
it takes forever to be able to apply my makeup.
on top of that i wore makeup over this
this is really nice until you try to wear makeup over it
my makeup begins to slide all over my face
my makeup doesn't look as good
sunscreen in this did not leave a white cast on my face however
did not look good under my makeup
makeup becomes cakey if you put it under makeup
it should work well under makeup
it caught makeup and makes it looked caked on.
hopefully it will work with erasing wrinkles
i felt like i was putting hair gel on my face.
this would not work under makeup
this product works well under makeup.
works really well when used before putting on my under eye concealer
it does go under makeup well.
pulls on the skin when you apply it
cant apply makeup over top of this
i can't put makeup on after using this cream.
i sometimes apply this before makeup
sephora bring back the too faced wrinkle eraser
it interfered with my eye makeup
it came in the mini makeup optional skin kit.
2 stars given because it does do a good job of removing makeup
it does not take off makeup very well
this did well at removing my makeup
it removes make up
works well under makeup
while it did remove dirt
it's good at removing the dirt
it was great for removing dirt
it left a lot of makeup behind even after two washes
didn't even remove my makeup as it claimed
great product to get you makeup off before you wash your face
i wear double wear
this is the only makeup remover that i have tried that actually removes all of it
does not remove all make up
it's the better of the other clinique face washes
this does not take off waterproof or long wear makeup
it makes my makeup look worse under my eyes.
worked great with my makeup
in the morning under makeup
i keep messing with new eye creams
one thing i do like about it is that i can wear it under makeup without my eye makeup running
if i put it on before my makeup my mascara would raccoon very quickly
then apply to the skin
the face wash works great for me
this face mask works well.
i did apply the mask
it's easy to remove unlike some masks
worked well with my makeup
i don't wear makeup so needed an spf that doesn't make me look shiny
the makeup artist removed the foundation on my skin then applied this moisturizer before applying the nars sheerglow
the make up remover is pretty good
i end up having to use eye-makeup remover
this product removes makeup
my brush was completely covered in makeup after i finished cleansing
it's not nearly as good at removing makeup as oil cleansers in my opinion
it did not take off all my makeup!
it gets the makeup off.
i just used it to take off my makeup
tried it twice to remove all my face makeup
it does an okay job at taking off makeup.
it certainly removes my makeup without making my skin feel stripped
it's also not too good at removing mascara
it was a great eye primer to wear makeup over
it made my makeup go on smoothly no caking in eye wrinkles
t doesn't cause your eye makeup to slide around
have to use makeup removing sheets + clarisonic along with this product
i remove my makeup with dermaclear then follow that with this it doesn't cause any super dry skin
the ability to really cleanse the face of makeup is missing
this alone cannot remove makeup
it didn't remove my makeup and it dried my face.
though i'm mostly not getting the "makeup removal" aspect
my biggest need is for a makeup remover
then still continue to get makeup off after with a removing wipe
of course it's not going to remove makeup
after washing off my makeup
i tend to remove my makeup with a towelette
then cleanse away any remaining makeup on my face
this is certainly not the type of cleanser for make up removal
i wanted something that cleaned off my makeup
if you put on makeup after using it prepare to look oily all day
yet when it came to removing even the lightest makeup
if you intend to remove any makeup with it
it does remove makeup
this is certainly good enough to wash away makeup
i got this face wash as a recommendation from a youtuber
i even used clinique's "take the day off" cleansing balm for taking off makeup
this clearer does a great job take off makeup
good for taking makeup off
only giving it 2 stars because it does a good job at removing my makeup
this product does leave a film over the skin if you don't use a makeup remover first when cleaning your skin
i tested this primer by wearing 1/2 my face with it
my makeup was so oily
my makeup stayed on perfectly all day
i wore the primer on one side of my face
after i wash my face
i'd just prefer a 1-step cleanser that can remove everything on my face in one step
if you are not a makeup wearer
using it alone will not take off all your face makeup
the product doesnt take off my makeup
it doesn't come close to taking off my makeup or cleaning my face-
over to get rid of makeup
my skin was too greasy after using this under makeup
felt like i was wearing a heavy makeup primer.
which is great as a primer under makeup
all that it did was make my makeup roll up
it's fine to wear under make up
wouldn't let my makeup glide on.
i think this would actually be great if i wore regular mascara
while it is okay taking off face makeup
it doesn't remove makeup at all.
it's good to break down your makeup
don't work on eye makeup
barely takes off any of my makeup.
i wear a lot of waterproof makeup because i have oily/combo skin
really not for removing eye make-up.
want a makeup remover that actually takes off all my makeup at the end of my day
and it didn't even take my makeup off!

enough to rub off the makeup
this cleanser does not remove even light makeup.
it is not an eye make up remover
i don't wear a lot of makeup at all
i've never had to use makeup remover
this is not an eye makeup remover!!
it is specifically created to only remove makeup from the face
you can see all the makeup on the swab after wiping it on your face
it works pretty well compared to makeup wipes
this doesn't take eye makeup off
it didn't do anything to remove my eye makeup.
it did not wash away any of my makeup
your makeup will not rinse away with it
it is very effective at removing makeup when tissuing off however

it did a fine job of removing any face make up
great remover if you dont have to worry about taking off mascara
i tried to take off my eye makeup

it was not a good make up remover.
bought this makeup remover by accident
first, it didn't remove makeup at all!
product does effectively remove makeup
i just took off the rest of the remaining makeup on my face with lancome's cleansing water
this would be a perfect cleanser for those who just happen to wear a lighter makeup base
didn't take off any of my makeup
this face wash/make up remove makes my skin feel sticky
face makeup remover only, for our eyes?!!!
including my eye makeup
removes all makeup including eye leaves skin soft
alas it is not as effective on eye makeup
it removed most makeups on my face, not all.
i planned on using it at the gym to take my foundation off without removing my eye makeup before i worked out
the clinique take the day off makeup remover for lids
even though this is supposed to be able to remove makeup
there is no way you could put eye makeup on to of it
you can only wear it at night because it will wreck makeup 2
the next day when i tried wearing it under makeup
it is very greasy cream you cannot wear makeup over it
did not blend well with makeup
i wear a full face of makeup most days.
makeup removing wipes much better
wether i was wearing makeup or not.
when i wear it during the day underneath my makeup
i would use the mask
doesn't actually remove makeup
however i found it doesn't do a good job of removing makeup
it's taking a while for my skin to adjust to it
this new formula has no effect on skintone at all
only while you wear it
this eye cream did not work well under makeup
it sits well under makeup when used very sparingly
you might like this if you wear minimal makeup
it does not remove makeup well either.
i need something that will remove my makeup
if you use a makeup remover first
no oil control, no balancing out my skin.

i am able to wear this serum under makeup
when i look for a scrub
still leaves behind a good amount of makeup
now this face wash
did not stay well under makeup
didn't need to apply makeup
for the times i needed to put makeup
application of this product doesn't interfere with makeup
the lady from clinique told me it removes makeup
not that i care since i remove my makeup before cleansing
i only use clinique face makeup
all it did was create dry patches that made it harder to cover blemishes with makeup
since you can wear it underneath makeup
wash my face again
i applied this on my face
at least you can hide that with makeup
that i am now using it to clean my makeup brushes with
i ended up having to use two cleansers at night because this one was so gentle it wouldn't remove all of my makeup
although it hasnt improved my acne at all it does a good job at removing makeup
i do like how it cleans my face
i got this as part of the clear complexion kit.
does not remove makeup
this does not remove makeup one bit
or use it as a morning cleanser when you have no makeup on
it also doesn't completely remove my makeup.
t helps to remove any additional residue the wipe did not get
it also doesn't get makeup off at all
it does remove make-up well
did not remove eye makeup at all- just smeared around my face
this would probably be great for someone who either uses another cleanser/makeup remover first or doesn't wear makeup

my makeup got all over the towel
doesn't really melt makeup off
will not take off eye makeup so prepare to remove that with something else

no amount of cleansing would take the makeup off.
i know there are wipes
other steps to remove your makeup before you cleanse

my cotton round was full of residue left over from this not removing all of my makeup
use it to clean my makeup brushes

other than my face wash
and it doesn't remove all my eye makeup either.
while it does remove make up
though i don't wear much so most cleansers remove my make up just fine

let sit pressing lightly to dissolve the makeup
the lancome makeup remover does a better job of taking off makeup
it got off my makeup pretty well
i tried this at the store to remove some makeup on my h
i wanted a step up from my normal makeup remover wipes
i really wanted this to be my go-to makeup remover
it will take off the remnants of makeup
or what your makeup remover missed on your face
it doesn't take off eye makeup with ease either
you really need a separate eye make-up remover
as much as it was great under makeup
have to wait for it to soak in so my makeup applies normally
my makeup smudged because it couldn't sit correctly on my skin
i found myself having to dab my face after applying it to remove the shine
for some reason my makeup doesn't stay on as long with this as compared to my other moisturizers
aside from having spf
since i only wear mac's studio fix powder
i double cleans with oil first so no idea how good it is at removing makeup
although i didn't try it on my eye makeup
it is way too greasy to wear under makeup
my makeup did not stay in place
which is fine if it would actually keep my makeup on my face
even on my no i makeup days with only wearing this it makes the skin look horrible
it can help makeup stay on longer
after trying out all kinds of face washes
(i always apply a separate face spf.)

after i applied my makeup it looked horrible.
when i try to use under makeup
the makeup just rolls off
i used it for the first time to remove makeup
my face appeared to still have makeup on
when i wiped my face with a cotton square with makeup remover on it
don't count on it removing your foundation
it easily removes all traces of makeup.
it doesn't take off all my makeup.
this one did not clean my eye makeup.
it removes makeup well but that's just its job.
it's too oily to use as an eye makeup remover
this product is a great cleansing oil if you want to use it to remove foundations or any type of face makeup
despite being described as appropriate for eye makeup removal
defiantly does not take your makeup off
i prefer an oil cleanser that removes everything in one wash to eliminate the need for a separate eye makeup remover
the it did not remove my makeup at all
i wasn't even using any water proof makeup
couldn't get my makeup off
it removes makeup rather well
removed makeup very well
you put it on dry skin over makeup
i don't wear a lot of makeup especially in the summer

like i used it as a mask

it did not work to remove or help remove any of the blackheads on my nose
pretty good to wear under makeup.
wipe the product off that
will look into a different scrub
if i wear this under my makeup
it also made my makeup slide around
it also didn't remove all of my eye makeup
i found this cleanser took off my face makeup pretty well
it would never fully remove all my makeup

it does a good job of removing your makeup
let it dry before applying the rest of my makeup

not good to remove eye makeup
it also didn't remove my makeup as effectively as it advertises
it breaks up makeup

it removes makeup well
i normally just use a face wash to remove my makeup
it removed my makeup beautifully
i do not wear heavy face makeup
it still manages to make my makeup adhere to my skin
i still had to use micellar water to get rid of the rest of my makeup
how you can see the makeup "breaking up" on your face
i feel it does a great job on face makeup
eye makeup is a different story
it definitely takes some effort to remove mascara
i wear a full face of make up to work
even after a makeup wipe this did not remove the last traces of makeup with two washes
it left a lot of makeup on my skin.
needed to wash it off
who wants to use glitter on their face.
you can use it over or under makeup
it also never seems to interfere with my eye makeup or make it smear
it absorbs nicely and works well under makeup.
t makes it look worse under makeup
makeup like others do
eye cream did not play well with makeup
taking off eye makeup wasnt enough anymore
way too greasy looking to wear alone or under makeup
i don't wear foundation every day
i don't wear foundation daily
it goes well under my makeup.
had to wipe away little white specs the entire day
the residue only "shows itself" when i put my makeup on over it
it makes a film on your skin that rolls off when you put on makeup
returning this and the face wash.
do not apply before makeup
this cleanser didn't do a very good job of taking off my makeup
i don't wear a ton of makeup
now i use it once a day combine with a different face wash
when i use my tone after the face wash
the problem is that it doesn't get rid of makeup or oil
i still had traces of makeup on my face
accept it does not remove the dirt
did a whole face mask
it's a face mask like every other.
the appearance of your skin after isn't all that different
this did not remove any black heads at all
still working out how to use it on my face as it makes my makeup look a little too dewy
then i put my makeup on over it
it made my makeup slick off
it did not remove my makeup at all
eyeliner all over my face
however it does not remove makeup easily.
it did nothing to remove any of my makeup
if i have to reach for a scrub in order to actually dissolve my makeup
however it does not remove all the makeup easily.
i do not wear a lot of makeup
so gentle when it washes off all my makeup
not ideal for removing eye makeup
it's very heavy to wear under makeup during the day
i love bb's eye makeup
makeup goes on great
especially as something that will work well under my makeup
preps the skin for makeup
still doesn't remove mascara well
it takes off full face makeup
does not remove makeup completely
unless you plan to use another product to "first" remove your makeup
my makeup did not feel matte throughout the day.
it did however make my makeup go on smoother
i love putting this on before i apply my makeup
gives you a nice canvas to apply your makeup
keep my makeup in place
i tried under my makeup
greasy to wear during the day under makeup
applying makeup over it makes it worse.
when applying makeup over this film it instantly stops working
the only remedy to remove it is to wash the product off of your skin
when i do re-wash my face
messed up makeup and entire face rubbed off.
not easy to master if you would like to wear it under makeup
don't plan on wearing it with make up
makeup still looks great at the end of the day
is why i started using makeup wipes in the first place lol
t wear makeup on top
it tends to flake up when makeup is applied over it
it peels up under makeup.
this makes it impossible to apply makeup on top of the product
if it doesn’t work under my makeup
not thrilled with how it interacts with makeup or the fragrance
the makeup didn't blend well
while putting on my makeup
i am definitely a fan of how it works to help prep by under eyes for makeup when layered under my primer
also doesn't hold very well under makeup.
it looks great under makeup
could go under makeup
was terrible under makeup
wears off after a while
my makeup starts to flake off
looks good under makeup
i used it without makeup
when i try to put my makeup on over it it became chalky
the challenge is trying to wear concealer or any kind of makeup on top of it
the white finish shown thru my makeup
show streaks under the makeup
sometimes the pastiness would even show under my makeup --
this is the only treatment that removes my under eye bags instantly
then don't put any makeup over it
if you put makeup
that can even be seen under makeup
if i put makeup on top
makeup underneath makes it less effective
blend in with makeup
it didn't reduce the appearance of pores under my makeup
cheeks while wearing makeup

i still need to use a separate eye makeup remover
it does not even get all my eye makeup off
remove makeup with a lighter consistency
although it does remove makeup very well
cover your full face
my makeup separates within a few hours
it made makeup application difficult.
causing my makeup to slide around my face
i wear sheer foundation over primer
wears well under foundation
my makeup started to melt a little [even with an awesome primer]
i applied this immediately after washing my face
i also can't use it under my makeup as it always looks caky
usually i just cover them up with makeup
i've noticed less creasing with my concealers when i use it before makeup application
which makes makeup difficult to apply over it
worked fairly well under makeup
unless a very tiny amount is used it will flake when under eye makeup is applied
does a decent job of removing makeup
i'd just rather spend the money on makeup
i'd just rather spend the money on makeup
not suitable to remove makeup.
to keep fine lines not visible under makeup
i don't really wear under eye makeup
it does not work well with makeup at all
it's my favourite part of putting on makeup
since i already use makeup with the same level spf
wore fairly well under my makeup
at the same time it makes the eyeliner hard to apply
looks perfectly fine with or without makeup
putting a product with hydroquinone all over the face would lighten my entire face as opposed to the areas i needed
i can use the evelom cleaning cloth to get the rid of the oil from my face
don't count on it to remove eye makeup
other than the eye makeup
it does remove your makeup nicely
it was a little odd at first bc putting balm on my dry face with a full face of makeup?
the cloth was full of my removed makeup
this much $ for a makeup remover?
used them after wearing full face makeup
i also didn't use this to remove any makeup
as i wasn't wearing any when i cleansed my face with it
there was still a good bit of mascara on my eyelids so maybe not the best for makeup removal
yes it removes the mascara
did not take off any of my makeup
this did nothing to remove my makeup
not for cleaning your face
you have to wipe off the formula.
if you need something to remove your makeup
it does a good job of taking off the makeup
its impossible to wash off
i really couldn't use it for eye makeup removal
it is not easy to remove
it always left my eye makeup on
yes this does dissolve all types of makeup
the dissolved makeup off your skin
i used it consistently to remove makeup
it removed waterproof makeup
first i noticed not all my mascara was removed
second it doesn't really remove my makeup
s to apply to your face
although it did a decent job of removing makeup
it doesn't begin to take off all of my makeup
not great for removing makeup
nothing removes makeup better
more on the general complexion of my face i would absolutely use this cleanser though
i found this to be a really ineffective makeup remover
i generally had to use a lot of it to remove my eye makeup
effective at removing makeup
it did get every last trace of waterproof eye makeup off
this product did a good job at removing my eye makeup
it takes a lot to remove my makeup
it did remove my makeup, though!
it really takes a lot to remove makeup
it did take off my makeup very well though.
there was some difficulty removing eyeliner
it's not really for eye makeup
didn't completely rid my eyes of eyeliner though.
it worked good for removing makeup
works well to remove all makeup with the exception of waterproof mascara
oil-free makeup remover that gets the job done
you need to use too much of this product to take off your eye makeup
it definitely gets off my makeup from the day
it's just more of a makeup remover
it's better to me that the wipes or run of the mill oily makeup removing solutions
awesome for makeup removal
i mostly use it to remove makeup from my face
it worked well to remove makeup from the rest of my face however it left it feeling tight
this cleansing water is not cut out for removing makeup
it would probably work best if you're wearing very minimal makeup or if you want to use it to clean up small makeup mistakes or wipe off your brushes or something
it does a nice job removing my face makeup before i cleanse with purity
it doesn't take off all my makeup
it removes makeup but not entirely as i was told.
it makes its job in removing make up
having to removing it using this
using it to remove my full face make up with a clean make up remover pad
does not remove make up thoroughly as advertised
i also found that after applying makeup
i don't find that it removes all of my makeup very well
makeup off my face
not my favorite face wash
there are at least a dozen other cleansers out there that offer effective makeup removal
i found that this cleanser did a good job of removing my makeup
still had to use a separate eye makeup remover
gets my makeup off decently
it removes makeup well
usually wear full makeup
i find that even with makeup wipes
this cleanser does a good job of removing makeup
this does work as a mask
it was difficult to wash off the mask
it leave a film on your face
not worth the trouble of using a cloth with it when there is other option for removing makeup
it also works well under makeup
it washed off my makeup easily
don't buy this to remove makeup, it's not great.
multiple times i've felt i've had to wash my face more than once to remove all the makeup
my face was not very clean after washing off my makeup
this face wash takes off my makeup
use this as a face cream more than a mask
it worked good under makeup
i wanted a lotion that would help prep my face before makeup in the morning
tightens my skin enough to where i almost worry about makeup application
especially their face wash
putting that on your face
goes nice under makeup
uhg so much for a no makeup day my skin looks disgusting
i outfit on my face after removing my makeup
on days that i wasn't wearing much makeup
it's the same residue but in makeup form.
i started rubbing my makeup
what i don't like is how it reacts with my makeup
when i apply the primer i noticed that the gel
did not work nicely under makeup
it is not ideal when applied under makeup because it will make your eye makeup slide
use it only at night if you wear makeup
if you plan on wearing this under makeup
it actually made my eye makeup harder to go on
removes all traces of makeup including mascara
could use it under makeup
tugging when trying to apply makeup over it
doesn't interfere with eye makeup
light for under makeup
it wears off very quickly
i put on my primer
doesn't wash off my makeup completely
it did a nice job of removing makeup
this takes off makeup well
s- took me three times to remove all my makeup
couldn't use it to remove eye makeup because it would sting whenever i tried
used as a first cleanse at night to remove makeup
all makeup came with it
you can't use it to remove eye makeup
i'd rather not have a cloth full of makeup that needs cleaning to wash my face
it removes make-up decently
it removes well the face make-up
doesn't efficiently remove makeup
this is good for pre-cleanse to remove make up.
pre-cleanse to remove make up
remove eye make up separately
no lipstick or eye makeup
loved the idea of cleanser that would remove all of my makeup without leaving my skin feeling stripped
it does remove all of my makeup
it's such a long process for removing makeup.
didn't remove my mascara at all
the new formulation does not completely remove eye makeup
i wear makeup most days
my makeup was difficult to apply
or you don't wear makeup very often
no way could makeup go over this product
had to remove after applying
it until it wears off
before i even finish applying my makeup i already need to use blotting papers
which didn't leave a nice canvas for makeup to be applied afterwards
even when i only applied this product onto my face without makeup
my makeup stays shine-free all day
it looks like they want you to use their makeup remover first
i didn't under under my makeup
makes my under eye make up wear off quickly
make sure you look in the mirror after applying
wears well under makeup
that i had to wash my face
makeup dollar on things that perform
i still had makeup
or need a cleanser to take off your makeup completely
messing with my makeup application
i do think it balls up under my makeup
as soon as i put makeup
not just a face wash
still needed a third wash with another cleanser because makeup was still on my face
i do love the repair wear night cream!
i applied it on my face
i went to sephora to get my makeup done
i needed it for makeup priming
even when waiting the requisite 5 minutes+ after applying my makeup didn't set right
i would put apply both on after cleaning my face
it does create a smooth canvas to apply makeup
applied it on a clean face
can't wear it under makeup
it wears great under make up or alone.
after removing the mask
i wouldn't wear this under makeup.
maybe this is best suited for those who don't wear makeup
2) didn't stay matte, or hold shine.
other face makeup moved around
this product just sits on your face
i just bought one for my face and hair.
once it is on your hair
the hair oil works pretty well in the hair
i noticed my face was less oily under my makeup
i wear as little makeup as possibly
t blends in nicely with your makeup
makes my makeup run
blends into the skin nicely without being greasy or affecting the appearance of makeup
limited my use to when i wear make-up
other eye makeup smudge like crazy all day
i've mostly held off on applying additional concealer so as not to rub off the product
not leave any color
is really easy to remove
the worst part of all is i cannot wear this cream under my foundation
after i wash my face
i don't wear foundation
if you apply makeup or another product on top it just rolls up on the skin
i put this mask on
makeup application after is good.
only their makeup products are good.
also, my eye makeup is really running.
it sits well underneath makeup
not just the ability to remove make-up
it does remove my makeup except for mascara.
as i only use minimal makeup
it does dissolve makeup
does not remove makeup that well either.
the face wash is already working so well to repair my skin
s to apply to my face
it feels like i'm wearing a mask of oil
felt it was nice under makeup
wait a little bit before i put on my makeup
when i put my makeup on over it
didn't sit under makeup well
remove from my skin
thinking it was my eye makeup remover
it's very difficult to wear this serum with or without makeup
it did not work at all under makeup.
it rolls like crazy under my makeup
i mean i have to brush off my face every time i put makeup on after
i need to use an additional moisturizer after this one settles in order for my makeup to go on smoothly
it doesn't absorb quickly enough for me to use as a makeup primer though
i'd wear it under makeup
if you're not wearing makeup that day
not in the morning under my makeup
wipes away when i apply makeup
when i put my makeup on over it
makes makeup melt off during the day
can't wear it during the day because it peels right off
it would attach to my face
you can wear it under makeup
when you apply the mask
takes a lot to cover my face
which makes it a good product to wear under makeup
my makeup also didn't look great over this.
i take off my eye makeup prior to using this cleanser
it doesn't take off any makeup whatsoever
wiping it off: it just doesn't clean
the only problem was that i wasn't able to wear it under makeup
do not recommend using before makeup application.
it also does not go well under makeup
makeup does not go on smoothly over it
it made my makeup cake.
however no where close to a cleanser for nighttime even if it's to remove light makeup
works great in the morning or on days when i do not wear makeup
when i do wear makeup it is important to use a make up remover cloth before using the cleanser
i think people started to break out because the cleanser was not very effective at removing stubborn makeup
it did not remove my mascara
this doesn't remove makeup
i don't think it's cool to have to remove your makeup before you wash
even with makeup removed
it does not remove makeup well at all.
finally, it does not remove your eye makeup.
it removes no eye make up at all
t sits on your face
couldn't put any moisturizer or makeup on my face for about a month
i used his nurture me makeups
i wanted a day time facial oil that wouldn't feel too heavy under makeup or on its own
started to use it as a makeup remover
makes it hard to put on makeup since its oily
doesn't work for day use or under makeup.
i wanted to use it twice a day (under makeup) .
then i washed my makeup off
of large pores is so minimal with this product that it is not worth the time it takes to apply another layer before makeup
i applied this to my face
because i don't use makeup
it was fairly good under makeup because it has a mattifying effect
it kind of clings to my makeup brushes
its in a makeup drawer with no pressure
and all it does is leave a shine on the face.
a lot of makeup products are
i put the mask on
it doesn't have enough power to take off my makeup
apply it before my makeup
doesn't feel too heavy to wear under makeup
it also doesn't remove makeup that well.
which i found quite strange as i always remove my eye makeup prior to cleansing
makeup on days my skin seems dry
i noticed my makeup would not blend well when i was using this product
like you have applied face primer
basically remove the black heads
my makeup isn't entirely removed with this
primer-like effect before make up
fine lines form under my makeup.
i would also just recommend washing your face makeup off first before just so you're not rubbing that into your face
my makeup was not completely removed
sometimes for the ends of my hair
i wear it under my makeup
heavy that i use it to remove eye makeup
it required a lot of scrubbing to get my eye makeup off which just left my skin extremely irritated
unfortunately it doesn't remouve well my makeup
it leaves my face sticky so used it only to remove mascara
it does not removes it all
it won't come close to removing mascara
i don't wear make up everyday
i think it's pricy for not being able to completely remover my makeup especially for not being able to remover all my foundation
doesn't lift or remove anything
doesn't remove all of my eye makeup
as far as makeup removing
unfortunately it wasn't effective at removing my makeup
it did not clean my makeup off at all
it didnt remove my makeup very well.
this was not effective in removing all my makeup without needing to use soap
i used the product today to remove my makeup
the product doesn't work very well to remove makeup as i still have some stuck on my face
it does remove non waterproof make up.
texture is nice and it removed makeup ok.
it also doesn't remove all my eye make up
it did remove light makeup on my face
i can take off the day's makeup with a few swipes
i normally use little to no makeup
i've tried it over normal to heavy makeup
as someone who wears little makeup
i can't say how well it would do removing eye makeup
opted to use it as a cleanser after the gym when i have no makeup on
any residual eye makeup this would take care of beautifully
this does an average job of removing makeup.
it definitely leaves some eye makeup behind
it doesn't really remove makeup easily
hardly removed any makeup
this works to remove light makeup
this removes some makeup
i like to consider it a light version of a real makeup remover
this is not for someone who uses heavy makeup.
it won't remove two coats of mascara fully.
it loosens up my makeup a bit
definitely does not remove all makeup successfully
especially dark eye makeup
i usually use bioderma to remove my foundation
it didn't remove my mascara too well
it doesn't work nearly as well as it used to for removing makeup
i wear no makeup to my derm appts.
however, it fails to remove any eye makeup.
this product was recommended to me by a worker that said it would definitely remove my eyeliner
unfortunately it isn't the easiest eyeliner to remove
it does not help with eye makeup removal at all
it does a fairly good job taking off the makeup.
take makeup off quickly
i've noticed this new version does absolutely nothing for eye makeup
i now have had to start buying an eye makeup remover
as someone who loves makeup
if you need a heftier makeup remover this is not the way to go
after removing my makeup
all fresh masks do
looks terrible under makeup.
uncomfortable to sleep in or apply makeup over
it has a great finish when i apply makeup
i apply it under my primer
i tried putting it on before i apply my makeup
it seemed to pull a little when i applied my makeup
it did not affect my eye makeup too much if i wore eye primer
i dont wear a lot of makeup
i used this product before i put on my primer then makeup
it's great under makeup
not what i would use pre-makeup.
i don't mind a balm to remove my makeup
needed to use additional cleansers to get all of it off of my face
it removes makeup completely
did remove the makeup-
a simple wipe with any of the other above products cleaned my face thoroughly
took my makeup off very easily
my favorite balm removes makeup
did not take off any of my makeup.
it seems to clean well without stripping
i wanted something to take off my waterproof makeup as well as clean my skin well
sometimes feels greasy under my bareminerals makeup
not a good look in the meantime especially under makeup
makeup does not lay well over it.
my makeup goes on smoothly
it did not effectively take off all of my mascara-- non-waterproof
oil wash to get all eye makeup
it didn't take off my makeup very well
does not remove makeup nearly as well as she claimed
i still have a lot of makeup residue left on my face
then i noticed that my toner was taking off a lot of face makeup residue that the cleanser did not remove
i also noticed it didn't remove my makeup
i wanted to like this face wash
first thing i noticed that it did not remove my makeup
so much makeup was left
i love the face wash
you pay $75 for glitter under your eyes
while this may work as a makeup remover
what's the point of a cleanser that doesn't take off the makeup?
great at removing make up
unfortunately i don't like it as much as the makeup breakup cleansing oil
doesn't take off all my makeup
when i tested its make up removing ability by putting some tinted moisturizer
i guess you will need to pair it up with a sponge to remove your makeup
i wear light make up
t does its job on removing
after i wash my face
try to get something to removing my makeup all at once
other than it removing my makeup gently
it works just alright for removing light makeup
there was still makeup on the cotton ball
the towel was covered in makeup
this is the worst cleanser i hav ever used it just moved my makeup around my face instead of removing it
adding to that this doesn't take off or break down any makeup
was hoping this could be my new eye makeup remover
it says it will remove all makeup
it doesn't do a great job of taking off cosmetics
this really did not remove makeup
it doesn't remove make up very well
it removed my makeup
it was disappointing that only face makeup was removed
this is ineffective as a makeup remover
it didn't take off my non-waterproof makeup
it gets most of my eye makeup off too
it does a pretty good job of removing face makeup
t may not be visible under makeup
it does help to camouflage them
looks fine under makeup
however, it looked horrible under my makeup.
like the makeup was just sitting on my skin
a minute after applying it when i start applying make up this product creates junk that rubs off
then wipe my face off to get the debris before applying makeup
had to wash the mask off
the true test will be tomorrow with how my makeup applies
it doesn't remove makeup as thoroughly as the fab cleanser
my skin does feel nice upon removal
the mask just sits on my vanity
i get a better clean with scrubs.
the product is fun to apply/remove
i will defiantly go back to their original formula " "first aid beauty face cleanser"" once i'm done with this one
nice face wash i enjoyed using as a travel-on.
face washes that work just as well
it gets off all my makeup, too.
still needed to use a face wipe after for stubborn makeup
it barely removes any makeup
did my usual makeup routine
t looks like your shedding
especially if you are to apply makeup after
there is no way this removes eye makeup
i quite like using it on the face makeup cause my skin feels smooth
yes, i have applied to a clean face.
i will finish off the bottle as eye makeup remover
didn't take makeup off
while it will take off eye makeup
if every day makeup means you don't wear any then this is your go to makeup cleanser
it does a really poor job of removing makeup
for face makeup alone
a cleanser after using this to remove the rest of my makeup which consists of mascara
after using this i still had to go in with a make-up remover wipe
this oil did not do a good job of removing makeup residue
particularly any eye makeup
i choose oil cleaners to avoid the extra step of using an eye-makeup remover
while it removes surface makeup
nothing will truly take the entire makeup off.
does it remove makeup
this oil did not do a great job removing my makeup
i still had a lot of makeup left after rinsing

dissolve all of my makeup off
this is okay at removing makeup
it's an alright makeup remover
i would only recommend using this to take off makeup around your eyes
this is a good makeup remover to try especially in the sample size
it's is not intended to cleanse your skin rather to remove the make up prior to the cleaning process
no due to the fact that i want to try other makeup removers
face makeup in a single step
this takes makeup off very effortlessly
i'll stick with it as a cleanser to remove my face makeup because it really is a great product
will be repurchasing the take the day off eye makeup remover to h
terrible on eye makeup.
did not clear my eye makeup
i normally use makeup wipes to break up my eye makeup
this works very well to remove makeup
it doesn't remove entirely my eye makeup
not to mention it doesnt tackle the most important makeup remover thing
did not help makeup stay on
i would go for a full bottle of smoothing primer instead
made the makeup slide around
my makeup went over this very smoothly
i tried it alone, under my makeup and i top.
i think their makeup is great
throw-on product that i could wear
have to wait before i apply any makeup
it also "rolls" when you apply any other lotions or makeup on top of it
makes my face look super shiny with makeup
i've also mixed it into my makeup
this product won't be hydrating of concealing enough for even a non-makeup wearer like myself
it's useful for when i'm not putting on a lot of makeup
it also didn't play nice with my makeup.
the color wasn't too noticeable when worn under makeup
i can't even put this in my makeup bag.
this is a disaster in my makeup bag
this is nice for "no makeup
makeup" looks for running err
now i wear foundation daily
there was still makeup left on my face

it claims to remove eye makeup but does not.

as it you are wearing a mask

i don't wear foundation
i got this as part of a no makeup makeup kit
feels like putting toothpaste on my face yikes
pills up under makeup or if you use any kind of rubbing motion
unfortunately when used under makeup the product pilled
i don't wear any makeup other than mascara
don't wear make-up
as it is it literally pulls off my eyeliner
by the end of the day i'm constantly cleaning my undereye as all my makeup has managed to slide down from the eye gel
decided to use this as a night eye routine since to me it doesn't work well with makeup of any sort
am thinking it may burn when it interacts with some product in my eye makeup remover
just a little tacky for wearing under makeup
let alone eye makeup
also doesn't work under makeup.
she used this as my under eye gel
still left a lot of makeup residue after using it
i find that it's good at removing my makeup when used with my clarisonic

my makeup had issues
it sits on my skin so how i'd wear makeup over it
it worked fine under makeup
its doing work on your face
f you wear makeup it makes your product sink into any fine lines
it wore terribly under makeup
then have to rub off all your makeup
if you use this underneath your daily makeup it's a total nightmare
it messes up any airbrushed look
i wear it at night because when you wear makeup on top of it it starts to flake
this *flakes like crazy* under makeup
it takes forever to wash off
it takes off all of my makeup too!
it seems to remove all my face makeup
apply makeup on your arm
does not remove makeup.
makeup didn't go on any smoother.
when i have makeup on
it feels as though it is not taking off all of my makeup
like the idea of using a hydrating mask that i can wash off before applying my makeup
it wouldn't be ideal to be applied in the morning before putting on makeup
it's impossible go use before applying makeup since it pills
don't have to deal with it under makeup
unless you plan to only use it at night or don't wear makeup
falls off your face when you try to apply makeup over it
does not work well with makeup.
it does not work under makeup
isnt a good base for makeup
not for under makeup
will never use it as a makeup base again
it seemed like a mask or face wash at first application
there is no way to layer this with sunscreen let alone makeup
i felt it difficult to apply makeup on top of it
it doesn't ball up under makeup
it is easy to apply makeup over it
gentle on sensitive skincons: doesn't remove all makeup
remove all traces of makeup
lightweight enough to wear under makeup.
doesn't wear well under make up
can't wear makeup or it will cling to the dry patches
i noticed my usually matte makeup was all shiny in two hours
i decided to go makeup free with just serum
also i couldn't wear blush after putting this on.
so i could only wear this product with no makeup.
it made my makeup look horrible.
you can't put makeup over it in my opinion
because the ingredients are great i use it on days i don't wear makeup
literally feels like shaving cream on your face.
does not remove makeup or dirt.
it doesn't remove makeup well
feels like a cleansing milk without cleansing left lots of makeup residue behind on my simple makeup day
it does not remove makeup
it does not remove makeup
this cleanser is fine so long as you have something else to remove your makeup first
it doesn't remove any makeup at all
so you have to make sure you use a makeup remover first
it didn't remove all my makeup
after using a cleaning oil this takes everything off
didn't remove my mascara completely
this is definitely not a makeup remover.
it's no good at removing makeup
i used it the next day when i was wearing a light makeup application
it feels like putting shaving cream on your face
might as well put shaving cream on your face does not remove makeup
the mask does lighten up or polish the skin
it is good for quick remedy before putting on makeup or putting on any other facial care products
i often use it to prep the skin before putting on base makeup or skincare routine to help the skin absorb all the good stuff
it went on under my makeup great
doesn't work under my makeup during the day
nearly impossible to completely cover up with makeup
breaking down my face makeup
to make sure it picked up all the makeup i wiped a cotton pad
a ton of makeup can be seen
this does not "melt away" makeup whatsoever
and it does not move all makeup.
not a good makeup remover at all
it takes a good 3-4 pumps to get enough oil on my face to break through the makeup
it did not take my makeup off
on a day to day basis i don't wear heavy or a full face of makeup just cc cream
with this you will need to use about 2 to 3 cotton pads just to get rid of all your face makeup
it gets the makeup off fair
washed away my makeup easily
this cleanser effectively took off makeup
it also made my makeup pill up in little balls that got all over my hair/clothes
it made my makeup look terrible.
if i try to apply any kind of makeup over the product
if you wear makeup
i guess its supposed to take off makeup.
didn't try it as a makeup remover before purchasing this item
it feels like it's just moving the makeup around on my face
feel the need to wash face again with a cleanser that removes makeup
i still had to use a makeup wipe to remove my foundation
requiring me to wash again with a different product
for me it doesn't work as a daily cleanser to remove makeup
it really doesnt take my makeup off that well
i would not remove my makeup with something that has any type of grit in it
it took off my eye makeup pretty easily
it doesn't remove makeup that well
personally i do prefer a cleansing oil to remove makeup
i didn't remove my makeup with this.
i would remove my makeup with another product
wipe this product off
did not remove my eye makeup
not under makeup either
it doesn't play nicely with my other makeup
my makeup sits so well on top of it
it maybe nice for a morning cleanse when you have no makeup on
as far as makeup/grime removal it does nothing
it does take off my makeup
used it with a full face of makeup on
got most of my makeup off
i would only use this as a makeup remover
it would be 5 stars as a makeup remover.
it did not remove my mascara
this is simply a low makeup remover
removed the most stubborn makeup
i wear only a little
i still needed to use another product to wipe away my mascara
not sure what kind of makeup all the reviewers are wearing
this "melting cleanser" did not remove my makeup
still needed two makeup remover wipes after using this
a ridiculous amount of makeup residue still left over
