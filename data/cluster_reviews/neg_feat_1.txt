although i really enjoy la mer soft cream
i decided to try the original creme de la mer because of its reputation for healing skin
i do not like this version of la mer creme.
my favorite products are usually from france
after my first 2 weeks of using la mer
i wanted to love this soooooo much!!
la mer for sure has a cult following
kind of smells like my gr
that's "creme de la mer
if you want the true la mer experience
i've had my eye on la mer for a while now
a little bit of baby wrinkles as i am in my mid 20s
hmm i don't know how i feel about this.
beeing using it ever since i found this product.
my skin is combo i do get alittle oily
* i received this product complimentary from shiseido canada
i love this product
hi i never wrote a review before .
lastly i will put this eye cream on
couldn't leave the bottle st
switched from a diff product
continued to use it bc reviews on this will make you a believer
honestly it's no where near as effective at hydrating as any of the sunday riley oils
normal/combination- this will prob ruin your pillows
lately i've been super oily on my t-zone
it makes my t-zone oilier
i don't hate it
my tube has also typo in the description on the back lol
it smells like pinesol and ajax.
i am not a fan
i love their products esp their serums however this clogged my pores to the max
i can't say i fell in love with sk-iir.n.a.
def worth ya mula
i wanted to love this cleanser
i just can't h
it doesn't unclog pores like dr
i tested the ph
ts tricky to find suitable skin care
green is my fav color
days i didn't - oh god my face was a grease ball!
i do like ole as a br
i love the smell
i don't love it
my t-zone is super oily
i am also using the ole henrikson counter balance cleanser
because i love the sheer transformation cream
i love that this is lightweight
ts no big deal
it's ok i guess
i used this with dior forever foundation
help with the ph of my skin
i can forgive the packaging
decided to dive into the la mer world
t just wasn't for me
idk if i got a bad batch maybe
vit c improved my skin
i love the caudalie line
yes beware of the smell
but the smell is soo terrible!
i love this br
i love this br
and i hated the smell!
i def think it's an instagram hype product
i agree with other reviews on how it make ur foundation look better
it is an ok product
i don't love it
i live in michigan where it's cold for a good 8 months out of the year
it started happening a lil after i started to use this
this product also did not mix well with the kat von d foundation
i don't think this is a flop
i don't despise it
try the unicorn one because that's bomb
getcha self some rose hip oil
i would see this elixir everywhere on social media
i put some on my h
made it feel soo soft w/o that oily feel
the hype about this oil it smells sooo disgusting
i got bored of it
i've seen it all over instagram and youtube.
this is way overhyped and overrated.
this price tag thou like idk i'll probably exchange it
you know what i will exchange it lol
well i hated it.
t was definitely this oil
my bf loves the smell too
farsáli's unicorn essence is an extremely hyped up product on social media
i don't hate it
i mean i love this
i love it's a nice glass bottle
ive followed the instructions
this product is just o.k.
so far i'm very "meh" on this product
kind of like marshmallows or some type of artificial c
called it a holy grail product
i would like it better as a c
i love the packaging
just the whole unicorn trend thing going on
the unicorn title fits it because my makeup turns into a unicorn after i wear it
not sure about unicorn essence
hello every skin care br
i am a true beauty junkie.
for the love of god, save your money.
kinda like i went to sleep with c
i also couldn't h
le the amount of glitter in this bottle
i wanted a fresh j-lo glow
still on the hunt for the unicorn.
really overrated among beauty gurus
i saw a bunch of beauty bloggers raving about this product
which im also not a fan of
lol i'm a huge fan of many of their other products
i love the "glowtion" trend
this is sooooooo thick
yay, sadly after 40 min it stops working.
additionally i hated the smell.
it really was thet true definition of a moisturizer
again i love dior makeup
t wasn't even waterproof mascara
that's what the 2nd star is for
the only other tata product that does this to me is the elixir vitae
i love clinique skin care.
ive used it for about a week
i wasn't super crazy about this mask for the price
taking it out in a hurry lol
dr jart disappoints yet again.
worth the snap chat pic
for $12 a mask no thank you
as a late 20s asian female
my dog wouldn't look at me for 40 mins lol
i wanted to love this product.
t feels like nothing on the skin
here is some info on my skin type for reference: mid-twenties
i wanted to love this cream
hated to, as i do love the jar design.
soo wanted this to finally be what worked for my skin after reading the reviews :
caused breakouts in t-zone
i recommend instead the power couple by sunday riley it seems to be renewing my skin all around
i love sunday riley's good genes and luna!
maybe bc all of the beeswax in it?
i love all sunday riley products.
even the luna night oil
very disappointed in this sunday riley product

this size is honestly sooo tiny
for $25 cad sale price
it smells like a dirty gr

except for that it dried me out everytime i used it
loved it t first
this left alot behind
i love ole henriksen products
i much prefer their african foaming cleanser
i normally love ole products
it's not holy grail status
ive had a lot of moisturizers that have absorbed really well
definetly not a product for those with dry skin.

that starts with s
although i love ptr products
vs. the usual .50 oz.
the cream is ok.
when you think of greek yogurt.
i like this moisturizer, but i don't love it.
i love the smell
perfect for san diego's year-round warm
i prefer this in the tube

s over your face
everytime i go to use this wash
t didn't go to waste
i am in my 60s

this was a replacement for billy jealousy combination code because it's getting harder to find
i know so many ppl who swear by this
my t-zone is oily
i live in houston
i need all the help i can get for my t-zone

i always liked it bbc it absorbs quickly
i am a fan of clinique

oily in my t-zone
make sense bc this product def has a scent.
very moth ball-y
i wouldnt recomend for anyone with sensitive skin
won't buy this produc again
t wont go oily on you
there are no complaints from my gf
u have normal to oily skin then this is a good product
how i wanted to love the essential-c eye cream
have to use a q tip to get it out
i realize it has spf
t was great for traveling
ive tried this 3 nights in a row
everytime i put this on it burns my eyes
dispensing is nice b/c it's hygenic due to the pump
the pump imo, pumps out more than is needed.
i love the murad products
i love the fact that it has spf 15
i wanted to love this cleanser
thought id try this
the premier cru cream
i didn't like the scent.
so again just meh

i think as i age
which is clinique br
it's literally soap like h
i wish i could have loved it
i usually love dr br
pore perfecter-so yes
yes, skin pen really does work!
i don't hate it or love it.
i looked so many youtube videos before iam buying this product
i used a tiny bit because hello 'less is more'
ive been searching for the perfect primer for a long time now
i would defenitely recommend this one
primer which far surpasses dr
thank god i didn't buy the full size !!!!!
this used to be my holy grail.
i tried to contact dr
t @@ i contacted sephora cs
t for not caring about their customers
my mom loves this stuff
it looks amazing under my bb cream
t makes my skin look yellow
as i usually like dr
t stuff has a very strong medicinal smell
thanks for nothing dr. gross!
maybe dr. gross can afford it, but i can't.
i'd heard so much about dr
i ended up switching to dr
primarily as a base for my dior bb cream it was terrible
i liked the packaging
dont see a difference after 4-6wks
i really love my rose face cream.
i hate artificial fragrance in face products: that's why i wear perfume
bought ole henriksen serum instead
i love the smell of this product
i love the smell
i loved it for that purpose.
i loved everything about this- the spf30
i don't feel it's as effective as the peter thomas roth product i used to use
i did however purchase other dr
i am in love with them
i expected a lot more f rom such an expensive item
i don't hate it, but i don't love it.
thank goodness i didn't pay for it.
my cheeks are dy
i cant justify the price tag for this product
s behind every product
combined it with creme ancien this entire time
t made me breakout like a pepperoni pizza
omg it stung my eye worse than.
my bf asked if i was ok because my eyes were so red
this is a nope for me.
i love the clinique oil
that's all the pros of this
especially in the chicago winters
i wouldnt keep on your skin
i am actually a fan of clinique
i love clinique products
i felt as though it left an ily film on my face
thank goodness for sephoras return policy!
it smelt like a bottle of my gr
dr jart is a miracle cream compared to this.
i wouldnt say that i have exessively dry skin
i tried the shiseido super revitalizer
reminded me of my gr
i am actually using it in my h
i love all the shiseido products i use except this one
i wanted to love this eye cream
i am not fan of limonene
not to mention 60 bucks cheaper lol
i can't leave my contact info
i am already a shiseido night mask diehard
i wanted to love it
it s ok it can be softer
i do get a lil dewy on my forehead
this mois not helpful at all
i started getting the t-zone shine that forever plagues me
i love this br
the sephora lady recommend me this cus i get super oily in my t-zone
i felt super tacky from it alllll day.
that's something i could get with a ds moisturizer
i looked like a shiney
i give it a 3 star bc it didn't control oil after the 3 hr mark
i wish it had spf
it made my t-zone very greasy
ter onto my face
it's my go to br
bought this product in march b/c the reviews are great
i wanted to love this
i just couldn't h
the scent was ok
ew... it was so gross i had to return it.
i love this line by shiseido
fits my asian skin
i look like a clown!!!
hate hate hate hate
if there was a worser word for hate
i didn't like the container.
ok for the price
ter on your face
it caused mila around my eyes
overall this product is meh.
i wish i loved this eye cream
i received this in my 500pt reward.
this eye cream is ok
2nd time clinique disappoints me!
mostly ppl recommended it
i instantly loved it
not evenin the "t zone"
i like the product
i only use the ren peel.
ed to the products i'm using
i wish i loved this product because i love the moisturizer
usually i think im ok with scents.
and i enjoy other products from the ren line.
i love the idea of this br
like all the ingredients, etc.
wanted to look for a milk cleanser b/c in chicago you have heat in your place
ed me the product
its very sad since i love other ren products.
i am a huge ren fan
i love ren products except this one.
i wish sephora carried the bath/body stuff!!
wanted to try out ren
the dispenser is stupid !...
btw- my issues are dark circles
i dont feel the tingle
its really hard to get small amount out if u touch rhe pump
it gives more then u need
thank goodness cause this one is pricey
i enjoy ren products
as i love some of the other ren products
everytime i apply this cream it stung my eyes
i really wanted to love this as my hg daytime moisturizer isfrom ren
i guess thats my fault
ard night lotion: shiseido night moisture recharge
come on ren, live up to your hype.
i picked up ren frankincense
boswellia serrata nightcream because i love the ethics of the br
it is not a keeper since my purpose was for my oh-almighty blackheads which has haunted me for over a decade
i like this mask.
especially around the t-zone area
this ren product does what it promises
i would look into another br
i love the product
use an exfoliater/masks to get my aha/bha's
i like the concept
always used a diff cleanser before
i used it with my mia clarisonic
which i can't st
you know its a week before the dreaded visit from aunt flo
i tryed it a few time
never toss the reciept girls.
not for the better lol
i like the concept
i love this stuff.
i got this serum in the md dem
i think it's due to the other products in the dem
i love clinique products
just gimme my josie maran argan oil
just gimme my josie maran argan oil
i love clinique everything else!
it's oki don't see the huge effect on my skin yeti like the texture
i love the peter thomas roth products
its performance did not justify the 15%+ premium it comm
ive been using this for over a month now
tere is no way that my under-eye wrinkles have been reduced by 52%
i used un-wrinkle eye
this product even shined through my high def setting powder which i havent ever dealt with before
with oil prone areas through my t zone
love that it's lightweight
i just couldn't h
i am a big fan of the umbrian clay line
i normally use the energie de vie night mask
got the energie de vie
so oily in the t-zone
i kinda hate the smell of this product.
i still love clinique
ive used a lot of clinique products for acne a d this is by far the most ineffective
dont waste your money on this!
did nothing for my 30yr old skin.
i will stick to my peter thomas roth acne spot
i've went thru one bottle
dont think i'll be getting a 3rd
today is february 10th 2015
murad is spot on with the aha
ive been using this for about 2 months now
i loved the smell
sadly this cream is a big nooo for me !
though i love caudalie products
swear by their vinosource s
i do enjoy the smell.
ter in this product
f you have oily skin this product is not for you
le with the smell at all
i got this about 3 wks ago
this product is too heavy for az
i expect a product that wows me
dont like the scent of the cream
i faithfully used two jars of the stuff
i love clinique skin care
f that is why you are buying
got the origins cleanser which i love
om flaky patches all over my face
now i can't use it without a q-tip
that's the only pro.
for me to love a product
i wanted to love this product.
i am a big fan of boscia
for redness it's a loser
i love all sephora products
i love clinique products
i loved the primer
for the price i wasn't awe stricken
i love that u can add the powder to any moisturizers
i loved the product
la texture du produit est trop fluide ce qui fait qu'il ne reste pas en place pour la durée de pose
le résultat sur la peau est satisfaisant
im sad that it didn't work out for me
i used up a 15g size of this from a sephora kit.
otherwise i love ren products
because i love the smell
i really havent notice much changes on my skin
i kinda regret buying it.
t would be a tall order
i think i'm doomed to under eye circles forever
which is disappointing bc of the price
used for about 4 wks now
i love that about it
i liked that it was fragrance free
i want to love it
idk if when i am completely out of lotion
tho i soldiered on
c13-14 isoparaffin is in it
i don't want them to be overperfumed ether
i like this product.
maybe it's operator error.
i love the smell
moreover it kinda burnt which i hated
i personally did not care for that at all i felt like i smelled like a flower shoppe
wish i hadn't wasted 100 pts on this sample.
smells like cabbage patch dolls lol
it smells like a c
i will prob not purchase this product again.
hi i recently purchased the restorative treatment
i love a night cream that perricone md makes
tight/flakey in my t zone
i tried all the dr p products for a diligent 3 months
don't tell me that a dr only puts things in glass
i turned 40 in feb.
i am a firm believer of dr
thank god for sephoras lax return policy!
i am a big fan of perricone md products
feel they age me so muchi i respect dr
well i went to vegas for the weekend
my last purchase was 1year + 5 mo.
made my fine lines look like aweful wrinkles
that's why i gave it a 3 rating
n that department of acne control i wouldn't give it 5 stars
i love this line
this wash was just o.k.
i am out of the county until november 4th
i would like to try other np products as well.
it stinks like spoiled fish
i think ole henrikson just doesn't agree with my skin
i love the smell
i wanted to love this cleanser.
i loved the foaming pump.
i've written ole henriksen via the website
i like the ole henrikson line
i absolutely love the african red tea foaming cleanser
ive had to bottle within 2 months go rotten
i wanted to love this product.
guys, pls double cleanse!
i wanted to love it sooo much!
im a guerlain person for a long time.
i loved the smell
i just discovered ren.
i decided to go ren
go back to dr jart tiger grass one
i liked the smell
the worst part is the absolutely horrid flower smell that reminds me of gr
hitting summer in nyc
i find that this product is not enough for jan/feb on the east coast
it smells like a thanksgiving turkey.
t must've been an ingredient in this
i tried it on my h
i hate the scent
one of the sa told me about this product
ren is a lovely br
i think it is from the shea
i don't enjoy the pump
bought this to help my super oily t-zone
i do love the fragrance
i wish it could work for me b/c it's all organic.
t starts to get greasy again
i wanted to try it b/c i have oily skin
i love ren the company b/c of its philosophy
i got this product in a 500pt perk.
because i love all the other black tea products
f you're like me
it's like someone left a pickle s
wich on a radiator for a week
ts not fair for me i saw results from using it for weeks
spent it on la mer
i when i rub my h
in fact i love them h
you don't get alot of product
i love this mask.
i love the smell
soooo many red bumps
it also has a weird bally texture when applying it
(i get better results w/ sheet masks)
i used it after using my clarisonic mia.
the texture is to die for
it is self foaming yes
i just couldn't h
tbh i wanted this because of the pump
i adore the packaging with the easy to use pump
i even drove into nyc from ct
really much prettier than the shu umera's
when lancôme discontinued their eau de bienfait clarte
i suppose that this is the product that substitutes for eau de bienfait clarte
running everywhere-aka wasting product
i wish i fell in love with this product.
i wanted to love this.
i only purchased this because i usually love ptr products
a sephora ba recommended this product
the ptr is half the price
i live in minnesota where there is zero humidity.
i love this but hate the price.
i normally love ptr product
this is a waster in my opinion
diff gel but they don't have spf.
ard spf 15 was a bonus too
i like clinique products
i loooove cliniques products
i habe been usually clinique products for years
ter face cream which got discontinued much to my horror
i like that's it has an spf
i love that superdefense has a 25 spf
take pride in thier products
om ingredient would cause a reaction
but the smell... dear god.
it was toadying for me.
i can't waste it
t doesn't start foaming for me
t keeps oils away
ive tried using it in the morning
plus i love anything with spf
i found this product to be great for t-zone oil controll
i love the smell
then got a chance to find the dr dennis gross foam which i loved
i love lancôme skin care
i don't wear foundation
have used this product everynight
i do love the scent
i think this is just too heavy while al
mi am in my mid 30's
maybe i need 6xs instead of just 3.
i am waiting for another br
ing on my shirt
tried the othere eye cream
my skin burns like mad
not even a fresh scent like sunday riley tidal
i live in san diego
i dislike the smell
for the price, yo could do better girl.
this moisturizer was a must have for me since i loved all other products from the kate somerville line
i really love some of kate somerville's products
i wasn't a huge fan of the smell
i love the ks oil free moisturizer
i really wanted to like the kate sommerville line
actually today ive returned it
i got this little set with my mia 2
this wash came with my clarisonic mia 2.
i emailed kate somerville for the ph of this cleanser
i wanted to love this
t dried me out
i wanted to love this
because i love kate somerville's other products
am prone to t-zone breakouts
i got an oily t zone by end of day
i hated the consistency
i switched to another br
i got a sample of the gentle daily wash by kate
ive been using this for almost 3-4days
horrible skin irritation couldnt even go to sleep cus my skin was
i am not a fan.
received a sample and oh my god does it stink!!!
i love the idea of this product.
wish i could love this moisturizer!!
my t-zone was shiny
there are some other kate somerville products that i love
that is about all it has going for it imo
bought in january and i liked it.
i love kate somerville products
i felt like i was putting thick greek yogurt on my face
i think kate has wayyyy better products in her line for problem skin
i dont recommend it
ole henriksen african red tea foaming cleanser
i wanted to love this product because i heard this br
the smell is ok.
not hydrating enough for winter in calgary
the packaging is insane
i hated the smell though!
for my skin anyways
i know kate sommerville products are great
i wanted to try this because i used the daily cleanser by kate somerville
i wanted to try a serum since ive
you cant unscrew the cap
i definatly do prefer my other cleanser over this one
this is a great cleanser to wake youn up in the morning
i don't feel it earns the title of 'exfoliating cleanser'
i tried it on a lark because i like ks retashpere
i loved the feeling
i wouldn't call it miraculous
read so much about the kate somerville product line that i couldn't wait to get my h
i don't hate the cream
i love these products
f youre one of them
i wanted to love this product after reading paula beguon's raving review on it
i am a huge kate somerville fan
although it seems hy
let alone anyother product u may layer over it?
oh well, back to the search
am in love with it
i love the smell
this product is not for me despite al the great ingridients
same scent as other ap products
i love the product and the smell though.

i love the murad br
i am a big murad fan
t products i wasn't happy with this
and i have tried a lot o products.
ing to why i feel this way…
ful of times so the jury is still out
tis did nothing for me.
first of all, i am not a big fan of dr.brandt.
this product doesn't hold a c
le to the mask it replaced
this product is ok
i made my bf use it
i don't think i will repurchase
although i like the br
so im only giving it 3 stars.
i sooo wanted to like dr perricone products
i don't hate it, but i don't love it.
i urge you to get a sample to see if you are in the "eh" or "ack" camp on the smell
once every 10 days ish
what a shame...i love all of clinique's products
this product is ok
it works pretty welly
i wanted to love this product as iam usually a huge fan of anything caudalie
it reminds me of something you would smell while giving your gr
f that's your thing
i love this brand though.
sticking with my ren
my skin couldn't h
le all the perfumes in it
and the price, ooh la la what a rip off.
in the end i couldn't h
i wanted to love this product
so glad i got this a vib goft as i certainly wld have brought it back if i pd for it
i gave 2 stars b/c did make my face feel smooth
google will autofill in "smells like fish"
i put in on my h
i wouldn't call it fishy
i like this product
i just started reading the book by nicholas perricone
i asked my bf to smell my face
reminded me of expired mayo
i somehow got my h
f i have any flaky patches
no change in the spots tho
thank goodness it was a gift.
ive been using this product for about 5 years now
dosent irritate my eyes
i dont feel it delivers
i wasn't crazy about this product
ive been using this for about a month now
t was sad for me to not love the cleanser
once i got it on my face, though....ew.
f it weren't for my toner i would never repurchase
cringe the minute i smell it
loving it for that
my skin loved it
my nose was like "nope"
i don't hate it
i love every other fab product i've tried
i love first aid beauty products
i love the dispenser
i didn't love the smell
ive always had kind of clear skin
ing in front of the fab display
i wanted to love this product
love almost every fab product.
normally i love fab products
le the smell of this product
ummm this is not a serum.
i really love this br
it moisturized on top of the ole product i use
i am a fan of fab
i think the product is ok
especially since i love fab cleanser
whenever i use this br
i like the product
to the point where i can't st
i can't find my receipt
t does benefit me
even drug store br
t isn't a total loss
i wanted to love this product
this product made my t zone oiler
i normally like ptr products
i like the vit.
usually like ptr products
when i used this ultimate cleasing oil i had trouble in my t-zone areas with pimples
lastly, spalsh your face with water.
i am a devoted user of shu uemura advance cleansing oil
very disappointing because i like dr
i tried almost the entire collection of dr
t pores no more
this is the 3rd dr
t product that i have used
i currently use dr
not as mattifying as regular dr
t pores no more
i got this for christmas.
i loved it the smell
lol, you got me straight twisted!
i wanted to love this cream
i adore moisturizers from the shiseido br
for me, this product was just "meh".
i guess i should've known by its title
i love the bosica line.
e it under my eyes
if you find that sa products do work for you
i switched to african black soap the first day i saw results
i started using this cleanser after a youtube beauty guru's recommendation
balances cleansers as well as the sunday riley ufo oil
not to bash this product i love murad other products
this must've been apart of the dr
an absolute waste of someones time
i do love ptr products
my face was soooo red
i dont like this product at all!
when i switched from a generic drugstore br
i've heard so much good stuff about f.a.b.
the pump squirts out a lil at a time
i wanted to love this.
my skin wouldnt absorb the lotion
i am also more oily in my t-zone than i was before
because while i love the pump
t feels cooler when applying
with italian genes i am always waking up with puffy eyes
it does de-puff
if you're buying it at 25 yrs old then yes.
it does feel cool when you apply the product thou
i like this product because of the rollerball.
thats why i had to give this 2 stars.
i do like the rollerball
t maybe unfair to rate
loving it untill i relixed it is really expensive
not worth it imo.
no ones smelling my face lol so this is one dior product i will not buy again
an sa recommended this dior cream along with a dior serum
i am a huge fan of the dior hydra life skin care line
i didn’t buy any of the dior hydra life pro-youth products because i think that murad’s “essential-c day moisture spf 30” is much better
i turned to dior for a solution
i am a big dior fan, but not with this product.
think this is a cream for someone in thier 20's would be the best use
00 i thought i hada bargain
i love this eye cream
we gave it to my gr
it didn't work for me or my sister patty
it does work for nana
i expected more from dior.
i just kept using it b/c it wasn't bad.
totally waisted my money!
i wanted to love this eye cream
for the price it shouldve done something
wouldn't take the pacifier i offered her with the h
i love cold plasma sub d
i really cannot st
it really does smell ike something that's rotting
i sent an email to dr
i love this brand.
love this brand but this was sooo oily.
love the concept and the brand.
t stayed greasy on your skin
unfit for my oily t zone
i like this product

i decided to try this bc people raved about it
idk if i reacted to an ingredient

le the smell of this product
crikey, this stuff burns.

i liked the bobby brown foundation
hello i love bobbi brown products all of my makeup is from them
i love love love her eye cream
i love bb's eye makeup
i didn't like the fragrance

or check out my youtube channel
i trust their br
ii love my bobbi brown base

ing of this is it's a moisturizer/primer

i only purchased bc the packaging was nice.
i love the packaging
i dont think its fading my dark circles :
it doesn't do the job for me in january
specially when i read about peptide p-199
i do love the packaging though
great that it's in a pump vs a jar
a mention on a youtube channel i was watching

ive only used it a few time.
i wanted to love this.
it's just eh in my opinion
i got this serum during ff event last year
with an oily t-zone aka combination
i adore the ren line of cleansers
i got a weird sensation
first off i should say that i love the ren products
however, this product is just...meh.
ii just came off of using dr
have used ren products and love.
like : ' i tryed it
i love all ole henriksen products that i have used
bu thti sone is too thick to apply
i got the full size because i trust ole henriksen
i wanted to love this product but cant.
i love this stuff!
i really like many oh products
i fell in love with it's rich
loved the "truth is in the eyes" eye treatment
since i love all the other vitamin c ole henriksen products
i don't love that it has spf
i gotta have my eye shadows
i normally love ole henriksen products
email was written to ole henriksen
maybe the 3rd is the charm?
i love the way this creme feels on my eyes
i usually love ole henriksen products
bought the ole henriksen fresh start
÷ just can't h
ole henriksens productsin general b/c they're the rare combination of natural
i guess i'll go back to my philosphy purity.
its a good product thou!
because i wanted to try something less expensive than dr
i just reordered the dr
this isn't the holy grail
t wasn't a good product for me
f that's an issue for you
i am a la mer user
being brainwashed by it's void claims
i've en using this product for a few weeks now.
i hate my dark spots ;(
i gave it 3 stars because i have only been using it for 2 wks
i wasn't crazy about this product.
i got this free w/ $25 purchase here on sephora.
thank god i just got the samples
but woah, the price... woah.
it literally smells like gar grease
soooo what's the point of this balm?
bc it has lil exfoliating bits in it
there was none of the "thermal" action i enjoyed soo much in the sample
my favorite is emma hardie cleansing balm
it reminded me of wd40 smell
wouldnt buy it again.
haha i decided to return it.
i do love the fact that it has no parabens etc
t sink into skin very well
i wanted to love it
i switched by to my ole henriksen moisturizer
i am in love with this mask.

seems to work nice in my t zone
t must just be me
t will run out

t makes it kind of useless
i tested it on my h

i feel like i washed my face with a bar of ivory br
i don't hate the product

because i love this br

i did help but holy cow!!!!!
i know kathleen lights love this product.
but oh god it is so, so lame.

the whole concept behind this br
i let this one seduce me
i hv a very dry skin i wish i'd love this product as good gene sunday riley
big problem is abt the scent
it's nothing to compare to the one it's winner bestseller oil all the time if you know what i'm talking abt
"bionic" after reading the reviews here
purchased the whole sunday riley line
when to layer all the sunday riley products
riley is cashing in
i want to love this
i wanted to love this product
i swear by sunday riley's ufo oil
it smells like a cleaned port-o-potty.
i know tons of people love this
it's a bummer because i love the luna oil
i guess for my south asian skin
you just never know with lactic acid or aha
oh how i wanted to love good genes.
after i fell in love with sunday riley's tidal enzyme cream i decided to try out good genes
gg made my face so red
credit to sunday riley i definitely noticed that gg minimized any burgeoning pimples i had
i want to love this item
the sunday riley ufo oil we both love
kinda don't like the slimey-ness to the product
f you're one of those that want your cleanser to foam
own a few other sunday riley products
as for the smell, come on sunday.
good lord i want this to work as ive tried them all
i feel like all sunday riley products are good or even great
1 week after i stopped using the ufo clarifying oil
just cleans ur face
i chose this knowing the br
this is the first sunday riley product i've tried

this line isn't one of my fav
i wear bb cream everyday
finally find my holy grail
my t-zone would be very slick
yes my acne is a lil better
i love the product but i hate the tube.

not a good product if u have acne prone skin
i hated this product.
i love the smell of it
t balls up on my skin
i hate the smell- i think it's supposed to be cucumber melon-y
i re-use it already 2xs
im disappointed after using 2xs
i love the sephora br
sk ii eye masks
my experience with some other ptr products
i loved the description of the product
ive been using this for almost a month
both ptr products ive purchased were a waste.
ive got nothing good with this
i usually love ptr products
i originally purchased this product which came in a set of other peter thomas roth acne clearing products
i really had high hopes of this working because the sales associates say its "da bomb"
everyone els reviewing seems to love it :
t seems like a fab br
bha in one product is heaven so try it out
my skin eats it up oh
was all hyped up to use this ptr gel after reading tons of good
god forbid i use these in the day time.
oh ptr, why did you change this product!?
as i am a big fan of peter thomas roth's uber-dry sunscreen spf 30
i believe this contri
i like that it's lightweight
t may be a while
i decided to try that after the ptr debacle
the revision serum is working soo much better for me
it's ok, smells funny, though.
since i ordered this online i dont wanna go through all the hassel of returning it
no bad effects tho.
i do not know what crack dr
i just can't st
although i loved it
i love the smell
i love the entire line.
im afraid that its not a sos for thirsty skin
i am dry & sensitive asian skin.
i do use the s
tho says it smells good
am loving it there
which i wasn't expecting because i just wanted my hair to smell "divine
i cannot recommend this divine oil
it gives me a mortician adams look when i use it
it temporarily hydrates ur skin after rising tho its like there was so difference
it does smells nice tho.
the mask dos it's job.
i love fabs other products
this isn't a miracle product
for masks i like asian brands.
i love the fab line
but it's a fun mask.
like bb cream of foundation
mornings i put on bb cream
i loved the smell
i like this...don't love it.
i still love caudalie as a br

i found that i was going throught the serum verrry quickly
i heard great things about all of dr grosses products

very disappointing since i love dr
i dont care about it
this was recommended to me by a sephora sa
but my coworkers loves this one.
i wanted to love it
i personally like the smell of this creme
i think it smells like the ap treatment enzyme peel
thats the truth lady.
i won't be wasting my money again unless peter thomas roth makes it known he brings his original formula back
just like their bb cream
i really like the peter thomas roth line.
the ptr rep in the store
the ptr rep was great
i didn't like the dispenser
i do use the peter thomas roth max complexion correction pads everyday
i've had to cup my h
my motto is if it works
f you have very dry

this product is ok.
i like the korres br
i hate this stuff.
i am fair skinned
i think this cream is ok
i would love this cream
i don't wear foundation

i love ptr generally
like a "serious" nite moisturizer to keep my face hydrated
i hate this stuff.

i received the sk-ii facial treatment repair c for free from sk-ii in exchange for my honest review
tried to find it on youtube.
it's the only product form this br
this is ok to use.
since switching to sk ii treatment face wash
it does leave ur skin silky
that's just a creams texture rather than actually retexturing ur skin
my mom hates this product as well.

if i don't see what everyone is so gah-gah for it is going back
the cream is ok
back when the greek yoghurt line was marketed for "oily
very oily in the t zone.
i love it & dislike it.
my t-zone was oily
first, i will say i found the smell appaling.
u dont need a lot of drops
f you are not very fair skinned

off for vib rouge in november.
hydrated than when i used $1 sheet masks from my local korean market
i wanted to love it
combined it with other tata harper products
they didn't keep samples for the rebuilding mois
within the tata harper line
after using the tata harper resurfacing mask

i love tata harper products
i live in denver, where it's very dry.
i am returning this product asap
tata harper repairative moisturizer do nothing for me
tata harper is one of those br

went back to sunday riley cleanser which is absolutely amazing
however i picked up the ole henricksen african red tea cleanser
i also use bobbi browns oil cleanser before the oh
appearance it bottle seems what a luxury br
i heard so much about the tata harper line
the pump is super annoying tho.
ive tried other exfoliators that left my skin a bit more soft that this $38 one
sa in store raved about it
t lasts a long time
perhaps the sa was using a clarisonic
i wasn't wearing a lot
i wanted to love this product line.
tata passes the test
i love the smell of the product.
which i cannot h
i love how it's natural
massages in southeast asia

she during 40s-50s
everytime after using it
i wanted to love it
i love the smell
im going to just stick with argan oil
wasn't a fan of the cream itself
f you were a newbie like me
thinking oh it has spf
ed those problems to "my skin"
all that bacteria is probably int here is grossing me out
ard eye cream i was using before would definitely show some improvement
pm the reason ive used this one alot its good
this product is very popular in asia
the smell thats why i gave it three stars
i realllllly wanted to love this.
especially in the t-zone
le that brings in
i feel like it didn't really moisture my face as well as i was hoping even u der my makeup
not all ren products
i am a fan of a lot of caudalie products
kinda defeats the purpose
i definetly feel likeni need to rince afterwards
it's an ok product
f that's what you want to use it for
which is how it's marketed duh
i like to apply some foundation on my face before i leave the dr office
i am obsessed with face masks
like la mer for example
i will prob continue to use this every so often

i usually love clinique products
im not going to repurchase
i just need more ka-pow in my moisturizer.
not my cup of tea
i love the packaging
everyones skin is different
i dont wear a lot of makeup
especially in the t-zone
one of the reasons it's 2 stars
i wanted to love it
esp in my t-zone
unfortunately that's what im experiencing
t must be the culprit
which i don't have per-se
but it stings everytime.
i decided to give these a try anyway since the alpha beta pads from dr
n an effort not to waste $90
oh, please discontinue this awful product!
sephora has soo many different

i liked the muslim cloth
i wanted to clean my h

i love the smell of the product.
maybe 10 years ago i got a very big tub of a japanese facial cleanser that had the same consistency
the smell is meh and the product is heavy.
t seems to clog my pores
because i love boscia products
this smells ok, i guess.

ive tried the sephora mask before the pink one

living in chicago i wanted more moisture for the winter

the results are ok
je cherchais une crème avec une protection solaire et non grasse
cette crème répond à ces deux critères
ma peau est déshydratée et a plus de rougeurs depuis que je l'utilise
la crème est probablement un bon choix pour les personnes avec une peau à tendance grasse
