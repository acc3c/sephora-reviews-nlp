it just seemed to clog all of my pores.
by 11:00pm this moisturizer had clumped up on my skin
my face was covered in "indigo" balls of this clumped up product
used after a peel mask
oil free deep moisture
doesn't sink into my skin
leaves a sticky blueish film on my face
particles in the air was attack to my skin feeling oily
it is like spreading half-congealed adhesive on your face until it sinks in
it doesn't soak in.
my face will stick to my pillowcase
more like sits on skin and dries tacky and filmy.
it doesn't absorb into the skin .
not only left my skin with a weird coating
tery texture that just cannot absorb into my oily-combination skin
absorbs quickly without the greasy feel.
that it quickly absorbs
as the mask dried
it is super thick and goopy and hard to apply.
the residue makes my skin feel oily even after rinsing
maybe just made my pores smaller.
it feels tighter because it dries tight
it applies so unevenly
as far as the results from this product i will say it is similar to other peel off masks in that it pulls the gunk out of your pores
you have to apply a thick layer to make peeling easier
it works muck better
it is novel not because it's a peel-off mask
it peels off very well after 30 minutes
i love me some peel off masks
i couldn't stomach the intense alcohol scent seeping into my pores
the mask doesn't set properly to peel off
it gummed up making it hard to remove
it peels right off
it did somewhat clear my pores
it leaves a weird flaky layer that interferes with makeup application
this takes forever to absorb
the applicator tip is tedious
it didn't irritate my skins
ncredibly sticky on my face
it's a sticky gel-like consistency
it does not help with moisture or skin texture.
much prefer this than an eye droplet.
extra onto my dry patches
love their eye cream serum because it absorbs well
felt like a gunk of nothing.
my skin look so dulls
it tightens skin noticeably
the applicator feels nice on your skin
it ends up cakey
takes a while to be absorbed
this is a thin eye cream.
i've used 2 tubes of this stuff
it absorbs quickly, but it's not brightening.
it squirts extra product
the plastic cap cracked rather quickly.
i normally use 1-2 blotting paper
it's not actually waxy
moisture rich face cream
my skin loves moisture, but this is just grease.
this is a pore-clogger
that my pores were all becoming very clogged
it made them dryer
i tried wetting them with water
plus anything under 4-5squirts the pad barely sticks
i definitely saw a smoothing/filling effect
while it fills in fine lines
also, it dries too quickly to apply it smoothly.
try their pores no more primer instead
it will rub off
it often peeled off in clumps
then i’ll layer this on.
filler at my smile lines
it was like rubbing thick
stinky water on my skin
it is so drying
do have larger pores
leaves your skin like dry paper
i instantly hated it due to the greasy texture
greasy on my face
except that my pores are visibly clogged
it didnt plump or fill out my skin
i also don't like the pump container.
it makes fat granules under eye area
hard to get out of the shaker
immediately went flaccid into a liquid
it's like a weird aerosol that comes out slightly foamy
different with the foam
temporary plumping of the skin
the spray system is weird
it doesn't foam effectively each time
have used a variety of clay/charcoal clarifying masks
did not actually remove/extract impurities
then it also reminds me of bug spray
it left my face with a soapy residue
i deal with oil skin and large nose pores.
it completely dried out my sensitive combination skin
ncredibly dry my skin started cracking after about 3 uses
even clogged my pores after a couple uses
my pores would become clogged creating some slight break outs
it was like it stripped my skin from its natural moisture
it felt more like it was clogging my pores
which is a little too watery for a mud based product
storing it upside-down helps
applicator leaves a lot to be desired
tugs at your eyes
its not greasy and it absorbs quickly.
unfortunately within a minute it clumps
leaves flakes all over your skin
everything started clumping/flaking off
it's embarrassing to have to keep wiping away the clumps
i found it sticky
doesn't moisture at all
it clogged my pores so badly
absorbs quickly into clean skin
it was like a layer of glue on my face
applied it over a freshly cleaned/dried face
pilling off of my forehead
am prone to clogged pores
it balled up on my skin
it would flake off
the "flakes" looked a lot like eraser flakes after you've erased something on paper
-laced goo on my face
the scrubbing grains are far too coarse for my skin
they feel like sharp crystals
the grains are far too large to actually exfoliate
it's like putting blobs of lotion on your face
this mask is thick and sticky.
the raw sugar crystals in my free sample were really sharp
gently rubbing caused my skin to have microcuts
if you like rubbing raw honey
sugar in the raw on your face
it dissolves which is nice
masks usually lift up dirt
it also dries out my combination skin
have noticed that it really strips my combination skin of moisture
i used it with clarisonic brush
it fills with water
helps to clean out my pore
i used on clean dry skin
it didn't have the hard texture usually characteristic of a charcoal mask
maybe slightly smaller pores
pores did appear smaller
less than 5 minutes of putting this goop on
smeared it on the pore areas
it's like this product settled into my pores
the pores stayed the same
i wanted my pores to shrink
my skin is fairly clear aside from my enlarged pores
this product sat on top of the skin like grease.
oily instead of giving it a glow
i tried applying it with a brush
"minimize pores, blur imperfection".
loved the former bare minerals skin care line with active soil complex
it saturated my face well.
isn't for oily skin
it clogged up my pores
this locks moisture in
my lips started peeling
however it does help with my cuticles
one star off for the applicator - it's awkward.
then roll it onto my palm
this product clogged my pores
it's smears on the skin
it took longer to absorb than the jojoba
roller balls are not sanitary
i used a tiny amount then blowdried my hair.
dry skin on my elbows
it is thick and messy.
i would suspect the silicone interfered with absorption
the oils just clogged my pores
the texture when applied is greasy
it leaves a sort of almost slimy residue
they melt in the heat.
cools for the first minute
it doesn't glide well
the gel wears off
a waxy film was left on my skin
i like the cooling sensation
as it dried down
sticky when it dried
my skin didn't soak up the moisture.
rather than a jar that's easy to contaminate
i've used much better cooling/de-puffing eye gels
i know you can use your fingers or applicator
le the sticky film your face gets when it absorbs into your skin
cooling effect wears away within 10 seconds
left a gross waxy film on my face
waxy feeling seconds after drying
as it is a cooling water
the feeling quickly fades away
it fades very quickly
leaves a sticky tacky heavy residue that hurts to attempt to blend into the skin
it's peeling off into little balls
traps oil in your pores
after using it for a week my normally clear skin was completely congested with clogged pores
although it absorbs fairly quickly
unfortunately this moisturizer clogged my pores.
it soaks in the skin nicely
it also caused texture underneath my skin.
oily on my skin
absorbs quickly into the skin
i quickly washed it off
this helps applying any clay mask much easier
it's just water with tingling effect.
the spray nozzle on this is horrible
gives you a bit of moisture
nicely preps your skin
my bottle sprayed evenly although it did take a few spritzes to get everywhere on my face
it didn't make a difference in mask application or rinsing
it didn't even spray on evenly.
one annoying thing is the nozzle
it shoots the product at your face
just wash/steam your face
i might as well have misted some water on my face before masking
found that a few sprays of this before applying a hydrating mask really helps the mask sink in
make my eyes water
pat the liquid onto your face
rinse off your mask
or possibly just spritzing water over your face before applying the mask
as for making it easier to rinse your mask off
wringing the water out
setting the cloth over your face so the warmth
moisture loosen the mask
use a mist or essence first before masking
it does soften your skin
help spread your mask
i felt that the mask soaked a lot faster into my skin
so you would need three sprays for one cheek to cover the entire cheek area
from sheet masks to mud masks to cream masks to gel masks
it foams up pretty well
lathered nicely and rinsed easy.
it smells like eyelash glue.
it has a strange feel when rinsing
just leaves this oily film on your skin
pros: foams up really well
it lathers really nicely
it clogged my pores
followed by the khiels face wash to wash the oil off
though it sometimes requires a bit more scrubbing with waterline eyeliner
it almost feels like it leaves a coat of wax on my face
my skin would be soft after rinsing it off

now for the liner pencil.
it does not glide
depending how you like your lashes
the liner goes on well
that the applicator was shaped differently
the applicator felt cool to the touch
the round applicator isn't worth it
or it only comes with about 5 milimeters of eyeliner
lightweight on the skin
dipping in your fingers over time not only destabilizes the product
it quickly sinks into the skin
sinks quickly into my skin
it doesn't seem to clog my pores which is nice
it was fast absorbing
it becomes super greasy
soon after though all of my pores on my cheeks
hence my pores getting clogged

it leaves a white residue on the face
using it on my throat
then i tried applying my makeup with a brush or fingers instead of using my beauty blender
is packed with skin irritants
the first few ingredients is a type of silicone which means it has the strong possibility of clogging your pores

the plastic bottle is thick

it absorbs into the skin really quickly
sat on the surface of my skin
it definitely absorbs quickly
it sinks right into the skin
i washed my face as normal
freaked out because of the freaking water droplets
does absorb fairly quickly
it did not help with smoothness or discolouration
found myself layering my normal eye cream over top of this to prevent my under eyes from drying out
skate the product well before dispensing it into your palm for application to the face
i feel like a grease slick.
for a "mask" this absorbs so fast.
i even gently massaged on a first layer
makes my eyes water
it dried out my eyes
when i ceased using this product the feeling of "chemical peel" disappeared
tugs at the delicate skin around the eye area during application
definitely de puffs my ugly puffy bags
this product is like gliding a balm of water under your eyes
the lid doesn't close
the lid just spins into place
it is sticky once applied to the skin
drys with a smooth finish
really dries me out
i've tried charcoal bars before
makeup layers horribly over it
will stick with the black gel.
except when you're in direct sunlight
my pores appear larger
this is not for oily skin due to its oily texture
the oily sensation does not disappear after applying
love the light weight moisture
then rinse for a bigger better effect

just because the capsules don't spread easily

this product is thin and sticky.
my main concern is pores
it did not affect my pores
slinky20141 out of 5flakes off
my pores less noticeable
sometimes it flakes or rubs off after a couple hours
since this product is a sticky gel texture it dries to a thin film on top of your skin
it oxidized it very red
almost feels like applying clear liquid glue.
it exaggerated every pore and imperfection.
"patting" it into my skin
my pores were not "smoothed" in fact
i try to put on as thin a layer as possible
it does get absorbed quickly
it gives you a smooth layer or canvas on which to apply make up
keeps your face mat
it also drips into my mouth
pour it into a mini spray bottle
tried to reconstitute with water
after several minutes blotting with paper towels i looked human again
dryer areas on cheeks
my skin is actually flaking on my nose after i cleanse
did absolutely nothing to blot oil or prevent oiliness
never really feels like it dries or absorbs
doesn't remove excess oil
i tried blotting it on when i was looking oily
my foundation still settles into my pores
my forehead was just as oily even after application
stick with blotting papers.
dabbed the oily spots
i do notice some shimmer particles on my face after applying it
dullness or pore size
watery gel texture sinks in pretty well
once it is absorbed into the skin
firm or contour my eyes
his under eye skin looks smother
which may have been the pore clogging ingredients
beware, this can clog pores.
which helps absorb the oil
when the humidity is lower
my skin dries out much more easily
really massaging it into my skin
it absorbs quickly and feels soft.
the cream comes in what is essentially a plastic jar with a much smaller plastic jar inside
clogged my pores and made them worse.
i wouldn't say it absorbs quickly
it also had a weird dimethicone silicon texture despite being silicon free
locks moisture into your skin
it didn't penetrate my skin at all
also has been clogging my pores a bit from the heaviness of the product
my face is flaking
clay masks that do a better job of blotting oil
this mask/face wash is too creamy
it just exacerbated the oiliness
this delivered decent moisture.
powder covered up the glowy sheen
the glamglow was a bit too shimmery without powdering it down
or a thin layer of cover up
have dry to combination skin
and it literally made my face a grease trap.
i don't mind my pores normally
minicrater of my orange peel face
it makes my pores itch
setting spray it makes me shiny
like rubbing motor oil on my face.
scoop it out as then it will contaminate the product
also, it doesn't foam.
it leaves stains everywhere.
i agree with the review that said shards of glass
it foams up nicely
this helps the larger pores on my nose
mainly it just felt like a velvet coating on my face
this product did not blur out my pores at all
i felt like i was rubbing hair pomade all over my face
it was a thick paste i wanted to wash off immediately
only use this to cover pores
i think it does a good job of blurring my pores
it smells like i'm putting glue or nair hair remover on my face
i needed a thicker face cream
it feels like a sticky wax
it adds a nice layer of moisture without being too wet
pores looked the same
it's supposed to fill in your pores
feels like a layer of plastic
it completely dried out my skin so that my cheeks started peeling little flakes
the area i have larger pores
this definitely blurs and hydrates.
moisture surge in the morning
all about lips under every lipstick/liquid lip/gloss/tinted balm product i wear
it had the downfalls of a pore-filling product
it blurred my large pores very well
it will clog your pores
it's a thick formula that sits on your face
it does blur my large pores
the additional non-greasy moister was great
texture on my forehead
i'll stick to their dramatically different gel.
however i don't see any blurring of pores
after it absorbs for a while
it starts to peel off
there's like a layer left on your skin
rolls up kinda like rubber cement
in a somewhat wiping motion
the product doesn't flow freely onto the roller ball
just another serum that uses fancy words to clog my pores
my pores instantly shrunk
after my skin absorbed it
peeling patches on my chin
the product was thick
it gets a little sticky as it absorbs
after it soaks in pretty quickly
then becomes oily on my skin
my pores all over my face became clogged
it goes on sticky
the applicator brush is a great little add on.
your "glow" is only coming from the shimmer particles in this product
nose get very oily
tons of silicones in it that caused clogged pores all over my face
pores look smaller by illusion
exchanged it for the water cream
totally disagree with it's name "balanced pore perfecting water gel moisturizer" clogged my pores
it doesn't reduce appearance of pores whatsoever
still have some lightweight moisture
without various other pore primers
after a week my pores are super clogged
it dried out my skin
even with cooler temperatures
like a mixture of iceberg lettuce
felt like sticky glue on my face
almost like watered down glue
reduce the size of my pores
turns out super oily as the day progresses
the tackiness can act as a primer
even on oily skin like mines
even with a dusting of powder
i love the lip balm
found that this always left a thin layer of sebum behind
the exfoliating particles weren't big or dense enough to actually slough off my dead skin
i like that this mask is a peel off
makes them all watery
as pretty as this peel mask looks
it does clear most of my pores
the mask does not peel easily from skin
it dries out your skin.
it is difficult to peel off
while applying this mask it instantly made my eyes water
it peeled off pretty easily
the smell subsides after awhile as the peel dries
i've never seen any impurities actually removed
you have to put a thick coat on to have it peel off nicely
when it dries its such a thin layer that its hard to peel off bought it
it literally made my skin peel
this mask comes off so harshly that it literally peels off my skin at sensitive areas
by peeling off i mean
it has glitter specks which i hate
metallic looking stuff dries but does not peel.
pores definitely feel clean and tightened.
had to remove with wash cloth
my pores were dark
it dried my skin
completely dried out my skin while the dirt remained in my poors
you literally have to apply a very thick layer
its a peel mask which is fun
might as buy glue
add some copper glitter
i only used a thin layer
slathered it on the second time
peeling this off is such a hassle.
stuff like pore strips
then it crinkles up so you can really look at the mask surface
it's so thick it doesn't go into pores
after peeling, the skin is drier than before.
this mask was hard to peel off
i've never been a fan of peel off masks
very difficult to peel off
i tried to peel it off
it hurt my skin to peel off
it goes away quickly as it dries
i love peeling mask
yet effective enough to remove sebum/oil
residues of night cream or sleeping mask
the dispenser stopped pumping foam
it's foamy when you use 3 or more pumps
i love the foam
how well it cleans
dried my skin out :
it seems to clog my pores.
performance: it provides a deep cleaning
because i love a mud mask
it doesn't dry and shrink the pores.
it leaves behind a waxy texture
oily 6 hours after applying the product
it dries up too quickly on my skin
it does not absorb smoothly
the new applicator wastes product
the cream was thick
the booster does not absorb into my skin
it would peel off
i even mixed a half squirt of this with a half squirt of my normal moisturizer
quickly absorbs into the skin
s feel like i've mushed around in elmer's glue after applying to my face
this product popped up when i typed moisturizer for dry skin the the search bar
it just sinks into the skin
drying afterwards on my skin
oil removed visible impurities from my face-i could see black staff
it lingers ever after removing it.
it also burns/ made my eye water.
it was like putting a mixture of oil
the consistency is odd- like liquid out of the bottle
slow to absorb on my skin
it does absorb quickly
it left a sticky residue that did eventually sink in
even stickier on my face
which took micellar water
this will give a glow to the skin before it dries up
its a very runny formulation
wasn't crazy about the sticky gel texture
i found this left a sticky residue.
it's also very runny
it dissipates before you even finish applying
found this too drying
this product doesnt absorb onto my face
it keeps my skin oil free
this was drying on my combination skin
this product dried our my normally oily skin.
it caused my foundations to cling to dry areas
after slathering on a few layers
it drys out my skin
absorbs into the skin quickly
i find that it leaves a film of sorts on my skin after rinsing
if you like having specks of glitter in your skin care
skin doesn't absorb this stuff
the moisturizer turned into crumbles
i tried layering foundation over it
my pores were majorly clogged
leaves a weird tacky/milky residue on your skin
boscia and i just don't mesh.
not absorb into the skin
this definitely clogged my pores
so naturally this serum appealed to me to clear up my congested pores
does not absorb into the skin
does not soak into the skin
my pores are clogged
keeping my pores clean
my pores clog easily
my skin started drying around my nose
it looks like i rubbed cooking oil into my h
it did seem to minimize my pores at first
because much like oatmeal that's bubbled over
getting the thick jelly like mask out
it is a jelly texture with chunks
this mask makes you feel like you're rubbing straight up orange jelly with pulp in it all over your face
left my skin sticky.
unfortunately applying the mask evenly is difficult because of the pulp like consistency
the chunks get stuck in your hairline
once it dried it was a sticky
blotchy when i washed the mask off
the chunks are all over my sink/bathtub
the product itself has a texture much like a condensed jam
the fruit chunks are hard to wash off
e this mask on your face because the pulpy bits clump together
is drying my combination/oily skin out
then i went to rinse.
also, the water just kept beading up on my face.
used a cloth with warm water to remove it 30 minutes ago
the chunky bits of orange peel were annoying to try
clear out of my bangs after rinsing my face
feel like its imparting some moisture
it reminded me of jam or preserves
with the double spout
the double spout makes it impossible to open up the container
sinks into the skin well
it start d pilling when i rubbed my face
has two problems:--it illuminates more than it moisturizes
oily after using it
the shimmer sticks awkwardly to my dry patches
the upside to it is the smell does subside as it absorbs into skin
dries a bit white if not blended well
leaves a film on my skin
the "diamond dust" settles into any fine lines you have
it dries down to a shiny white film
seriously along the lines of a semi-subtle liquid highlighter or illuminating primer
tightens skin leaving it plump
possibly more than the charcoal mask
it's almost like white glue
you have to lay down a thick layer to peel this off
it's to "lighten skin" overtime from sun damage
iridescent goop instead of the thick white that it used to
lay it on thick
thin layers did nothing
the thick layers cleared out congestion from pores
it is not as drying as the black mask
use a washcloth to gently scrub it off
the white peel off mask
its easier to peel off than the black mask.
that one is more for removing blackheads/dirt from your pores
prefer a mask that's a lot tougher at removing dirt/blackheads from my pores
you have to apply a thick layer to be able to peel it off
i got 4 uses out of the tube.
the product doesn't apply evenly
its hard to peel off
even with a thick layer
average peel off mask
if you follow the directions "apply a thick opaque layer" you'd be used 1/4 of the tube
it wouldn't peel off
i usually love peel off masks.
actually left a greasy residue.
it does have micro glitter
my pores are larger
face lifting soft cream
i can actually brush off some of the product off like eraser bits
i struggle with oily skin
i initially bought the crystal cleanser which dried me out horribly
this somehow dried out my forehead
this surprisingly didn't cause any clogged pores
i like how the mask warms up
my pores look bigger immediately after each use
flaking the next day
it foams and heats up on my face.
toning i applied the mask to my face
then massaged it in
how it turns into a cream
it did get creamy when rubbed in
honey helps draw out impurities
because the thickness of the mask i think it ends up trapping the debris once it starts to draw up
when you rinse it off
it turns into a thicker white cream as it heats up
i washed it off
started massaging the warming of the product immediately irritated my skin
the steam liquified it
it burns my face.
in love that it's glass with a magnetic wooden top for the mini metal spatula
does not get any gunk out of your pores
which just dries me out
which causes tons of dry skin in the winter time
i found it drying
it will accentuate all the dry parts
cleans my face much better without drying it out
it only smeared my eye makeup even after using 2 pumps of it
massage with finger tip of water
i even rubbed in the oil as directed
felt like an silica slick facial primer left on face
goes on smooth with the spatula that is provided
i left the mask on the recommended 10 minutes before coating my magnet in tissue
once removed it leaves a greasy layer over your skin
went through so many tissues to clean off the littlemagnet
i felt like i wasted so many tissues.
my problem was the product leaves a filmy
almost oil-slick-chemical-y-gritty slime on your skin that smells very iron-y
you rub in the hydrating part that is left on your face after the magnetic part is removed
i agree that the residue is thick
it eventually does soak into the skin once massaged
the residue was really thick
i washed it off
the residue left on my face after using the magnet felt like a layer of petroleum jelly
it's recommended to leave the residue on the skin
washed off the residue
product kept sticking to magnet through the tissue
the mask left a layer of silicone on my face
it was a layer of silicone
just a semi-greasy layer of silicone
the amount of tissues is annoying
i found it messy with an oily residue.
you have to apply a rather thick coat
it leaves a slick residue on my skin that both times after a few hours i gently washed off
leaves an oily residue
to smear it on with
so many tissues to remove all of the mask
taking it off with a tissue wrapped over the magnet
once the magnetic novelty of this new mask wears off
i don't have the time to spread a mask on my face with a tiny spatula
then deal with the magnetic mess that ensues
don't let the magnet pick up a thick layer of iron from your face onto the tissue
the iron will stick itself so firmly to the magnet that the tissue rips
you will have globs of iron dust all over your magnet that will not come off
the instructions want you to use a tissue between your magnet
the iron dust so you can keep your magnet clean
the texture makes it nearly impossible to apply an even layer
really dries out my skin
be sure to follow with a balancing toner to restore your skin mantle
extreme texture all over my chin
this cleanser manged to irritate both my dry cheeks
couldn't even use on a countertop
i will dispense into a plastic bottle
however, its super drying.
quickly discovered that the dispenser was leaking
dries out my skin :/ i have combo skin
it dries out my poor skin!
my skin absorbed it
absorbs completely without leaving any film
absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy sheen on my face
for a non greasy quick absorbing lightweight texture
no oily residue as well
nose are an oil slick
my cheeks resemble the salt flats
my skin was dried
has a great texture that sinks in right away
it helped diminish the texture in my forehead
it instantly looked caked on when i applied it using my fingers
with a thick foundation brush
i used thin layers
even after several layers
going back to the urban decay green color correcting concealer
i've had to mix the product into a mixture of cream foundation
create dry flakey spots
there are tons of melting oil
like brush my teeth
the milk it melts into is al
it goes on oily
quickly emulsifies with water
also, it disappears the moment water hits it.
smells like the grease you use to waterproof boots
literally melts everything off
clogged pores of my life
this cleanser has caused me to have clogged pores in my forehead
i like the way it turns from a balm to a little milky
definitely didnt minimize any pores.
doesn't hide any pores
i don't feel that it helps with pores
have tried many pore filling primers
it was a thick cream
a liquidy substance that i had to mix together before applying it to my face
it did not refine my pores
aging skin with pores on the nose area
bottom half dry/scaly
it didn't fill in my pores or fine lines
it really minimized my pores
i've tried shaking the tube
since it's so runny
it no longer blurs the pores like it's intended purpose
it did have a blurring effect on pores
when i put on foundation with a beauty blender the product separated
did not conceal my pores or fine lines
it does well on my slightly smaller pores.
eyes are dryer than usual!!!
the cream is thick
it dried my skin out
it dried my under eye skin
patted on the bye bye undereye cream
separated due to lack of moisture as the bye bye undereye cream dried out the skin under my eyes
it lacks the moisture i need
maybe it clogged my pores
i felt like a grease ball.
i will return to my moisture bomb
it sits on top of my skin like a sticky film.
t actually congested my pores
the color correction jar during the day
it did clog pores
seems like more of a barrier cream than one that actually absorbs
their amazing sheet masks
oily spots got oilier
after only 4 days of use this cream gave me the worst clogged pores all over my cheeks
closed comedones from this
less like an effective concealer unless i apply multiple thick layers
the product barely color corrects
cakes up where my skin is partially dry
it is very drying
i'll stick with applying my regular light color corrector
it really clogged my pores
the product settled into my pores
it actually enhanced my pores
it will literally cling onto every dry patch
greasy on my face
it dries down very dark and orange tinted.
smelly paste that doesn't ever soak in
moisturized without a flake in sight
when my work stress drops
the flaky skin passes
the white residue would not blend with my skin.
greasy on my face
would cling to any dry skin
i set it with a translucent powder after i apply
this balls up on the skin
greasy on the face
blending into my skin without being noticeable
i then used the cotton pads to clean my face
use cotton pads to remove it
saw the sweat sitting o my face due to the matte finish drying my skin out
you can easily buy a cheap makeup melter
my favorite cleansing balm is the one banila co because it literally melts away my makeup
emulsify the product before rinsing off with water
for eliminating oily residue
this leaves charcoal residue in your pores which looks like blackheads
boscia's charcoal peel off brightening mask was great-
i even double cleansed
looks like tiny spores growing all over it
very soon i realized it was clogging my pores
when it's time to emulsify with water
it leaves behind an oily residue
i like the slip of the liquid
i think stick to the liquids
it does melt make up
it leaves a layer of wax on my skin after i add warm water
it goes on thick
as opposed to melting into an oil
it leaves my chin/forehead with peeling skin
doesn't absorb well into my skin
it sticks to itself like dead skin after a face peel
replaced that with this cream
this product dried out my skin!
it remains at the surface of the skin
this product doesn't sink into the skin
helped shrink my pores
it made my pores look okay
it definitely shrinks pores
meets rotting fish in a pool of stagnant water
left an oily residue
my pore got clogged
i need moisture for my combo skin
all of the copper colored part of the jar began to peel
melts on contact with the skin
the applicator rust literally including the hole by the cream gets out
body cream for my dry
doesn't cause my skin to break out however i don't think it purifies my pores
i still had melted mascara
this oil clogged my pores
it was so thick and gooey.
otherwise, oily skin beware!
difficult to rub into the skin
i even exfoliated before i applied this
it dries up fast
once it's absorbed it leaves my skin matte
even with a thick layer
put a few drops of argan oil in it
this moisture sits on top of your skin
massaged the oil onto my dry face
my face was a big grease slick
my pores were just full of dirt
switch back to my salicylic acid wash

when it was rinsed off
leaks if you don't store the bottle upright
it almost feels like a semi silicone primer
i like a refreshing deep clean to remove the day's gunk from my face
without spilling it everywhere
it didn't lather up
the cleansing bar stripped my skin of its moisture
the cleansing oil made my cheeks red
the powder turns into a foamy mask which is an interesting texture
try to keep it wet with a mist
after applying it the mask dried
it dried like a stain
after i rinsed it off there was green residue that looked almost like a thin film on my skin
it stains things it touches
while i was rinsing it off my face it stained my sink
it has caused me fat granule on my eye.
the face wash does have a milky feel
doesn't foam at all
absolutely not pore clogging
it keeps my ears soft and lubricated all day.
sparkles exaggerating all your pores
the excessive amount of glitter is too much to h
instead you can see little flecks of glitter
my pores seemed to st
my arms looked like i had drenched them in a bucket of glitter glue
one uses micro glitter
or the reviewers who don't see the glitter particles have some vision issues
i want the oily sheen again
because the light catches on distinct glitter particles
not like a finely milled highlighter
it clogged my pores
after it dried it was sticky
it looks like you dipped a brush in loose glitter
it does have tiny particles of shimmer.
leaves your hands covered in sparkles.
you can actually see the glitter particles
stings my eyes and doesn't absorb into my skin
it is a thicker cream.
it didn't cause my concealer to slide off or crease
feels like slicking automobile oil on your skin.
it isn't physically possible for dimethicone to penetrate the skin
dimethicone doesn't let your skin breath or sweat or shed dead skin cells
it completely glues bacteria
sebum etc into place on your face
long term use of dimethicone makes the skin drier because it disrupts the skin's natural ability to hydrate
it absorbed into the skin quickly
absorbs quickly for make up application
this product goes on smooth and absorbs quickly.
my skin absorbed it rather quickly
rub it underneath my eyes

absorbs easily into the skin
this product clogged pores
it's a thick unique texture that melts into a cool

topping it off with a thick moisturizer to prevent further damage
beyond that, it is peeling off and flaking.
i love the packaging and that it absorbs quickly.
it's dried out my face
i followed up with my deep tissue repair
my skin felt like i had a thin layer of moisture after
this product has the texture of a pore smoothing primer
oily with dry patches
doesn't pat/smear into the skin well
also this product does not smooth your face or blur out your pours
there is an uneven sheen from the primer that ends up emphasizing the pores on my face
it is very light feeling/ absorbs quickly
when it started pilling
i didn't find that it helped moisture my skin at all or reduce the size of my pores
having oily/combination skin
doesn't cling to dry patches
telling me that it colour corrected with particles
i cleaned my face
when used on its' own it left a white powder residue
my makeup just melts away
my face is an oil slick

with water became milky
turn into small gel like beads
washed my face with it
it left these little gel/plasticy pills of residue on my face
it rinses off mostly clean
no foam which is fine
my skin just felt oily/greasy/clogged
a simple slice of cucumber did a better job.
that claim to sooth red
basically clumped up my makeup
it smooths on nicely
cons - doesn't moister well.

the spf, the no pore look, the ease of use.
it is such a thick cream
the formula inside the sponge dried up very quickly
it does make your pores smoothed down
other than blotting sheets
rather just use oil blotting papers
i've used this over liquid foundation
it made the foundation sticky
didn't perform better than blotting papers
is a thin pink fluid
it’s bigger than any powder/blotting sheets i would bring for touching up
i first blot with a tissue to prevent the applicator from smearing my oily makeup around
then apply the "liquid" with the sponge
then use a translucent setting powder
controls the shine like any other blotting product
under my setting powder
being that it's a liquid
then when i rinsed it off
sticky on the skin
super greasy and didn't soak into my dry skin.
can lead to irritation not only on the surface
in deeper layers of skin

this was a goo that had no lather
works for decreasing my oily skin
it really cleaned my skin
this wash completely stripped my face of any moisture
this definitely stripped my skin of any moisture
it's like paste thick
this formula causes my foundation to oxidize so much that it looks orange

i do like that it absorbs into the skin quickly
it dried out my skin
my pores actually felt more clogged afterwards

it's not sticky or silicone feeling
it doesn't flake though
like the tiny applicator tip which makes it easy to squeeze out just a bit
it sinks in beautifully
i love putting it on my lips for a plumping effect
i look straight up oily
this is basically really fancy grease with some gold flecks in it
it absorbs so fast
this stuff clogs your pores.
this stuff is like rubbing canola oil on your face
i saw people using it to bring their brow pomades back to life
the gold flakes are neat
the oil lets the lip pencil glide onto my lips
it absorbed so fast
it never fully absorbs into my skin
slick as an oil field

the pipette doesn't hold the formula
it takes a while to absorb
it doesn't completely absorb into the skin
it left a thin layer over my face
it is a heavy cream for drier skins
it leaves a film that balls up
the shape of the rubber means it barely even suctions to your face
underneath the mask which makes it super slippery
dirty: mask tears very easily
when both peeling off
due to product being layered underneath the mask
left an almost chalky substance on the skin
it was just plain hydrogel sheet mask with a weird ampoule in a separate container
it doesn't melt into the skin

when i dried off my face pores were tightened
the next morning the white heads were mostly removable with an extractor
applied in a thin layer with a foundation brush
i noticed that this left my skin over-exfoliated
it foams up easily enough
the ball shrinks when drying
the ball continues to shrink even when not using it as it dries out
stored it outside the bathroom because of humidity
it's a little drying on the skin
is because it shrinks so quickly
so it was slowly dissolving before being used.
the "storage container" it arrives in simply lets dirty water pool around the bottom half of the ball
the ball surface is so smooth
it leaves my skin dry
it takes time for the ball to form foam on the face
got this to compare to the tarte friction stick.
orange extracts which can irritate those who have dry or sensitive skin

if, your skin handles the product well.
it lays a bit sticky on the face
the product was noticeably beading up
it does come with a spatula
it soaked into my skin quickly
it was sometimes awkward scooping out such a liquid-y lotion with a spatula
i still had dry flakes on my forehead
the spatula that magnetizes to the top is so unique
their packaging is always great with the magnetic spatula that sticks to the lid
so the clay is perfect for drying up my heat-induced pimples
the mask at first made my oily
i like to use different kinds if masks from mud to gel
i tested it on my cheeks
it spreads easily onto the skin

the texture is very gel like until it warms on your skin
i used the entire jar

it is a greyish foam
guess the matte effect comes from a residue of fine clay that is left behind
a mixture between plastic and some chemicals.
still searching for the right anti-aging/smoothing/firming product for my oily
it really smoothes them down
it does flake off
pore size or smoothness though
this stuff clumps and looks like glue clumps.
noticed the gel coming off in nasty clumps
noticed this stuff balling/clumping off
it makes my skin peel and flake.
pores a bit smaller after i put it on
it absorbed into my skin quick
it makes all my pores visible
the facial water that was part of the kit squirts out in a narrow area rather than mist so this is going back to sephora
it foamed up fairly well
gradually my cheeks would burn a little after washing my face
lathers rather than foams
boscia warms on contact with water
it's velvety and does not clog my pores.
it vaguely resembles elmer's glue or really old silly putty
it's like elmer's glue that is watered down
it just dries on top of the skin
but it dries out my super oily skin.
it immediately clogs pores
too many pore clogging properties
my skin absorbed it nearly instantly

it just pilled up like elmer's glue
my skin is on the drier side

dry or combo skin
whamalamadingdongs without causing my skin to flare up
that it even peeled :
it tends to leave an oily residue on my skin that worsens throughout the day
it absorbs really well
a dry patch on my cheek
the sticky residue is very annoying
then a cream for face it becomes like lizard's skin
my skin needs a delicate balance of moisture
if the balance is off it goes into high gear trying to moisturize itself by overproducing sebum
it feels like i'm rubbing pine sol on my face.
gently patting it onto my face to avoid overdoing it
the cream was clumped up
not absorbed into it
not too thick, not runny.
my skin is scorched.
this product clogged my pores
superrrrrrr oily & i have combination skin.
it sat as a grease pool on my face
this dried out my combo skin

that it's a tube which i find more cleanly
this thing clogged my pores like crazy.
it absorbed almost instantly.
in the version for dry skin
no calming or moisture to speak of.
wiping off with a cotton pad
it feels like rubbing milky lotion onto wet skin.

it also stripped away every bit of moisture from my skin
gives me more clogged pores
i like the feel of the foam
it foams up really well!
the applicator is horrible
there's a sizable flexible plastic cap like a lip balm applicator on the top
the ointment/gel turns cloudy
once i cut open the applicator tip
the applicator feels soft and finger-like.
the product oozes out from the top to the bottom
product was oozing out of the bottom of the applicator
the idea of putting the applicator on top of my zit
i am pleased as it treats my breakouts gently.
it absorbs into the skin fairly quickly
burned my skin more
cream just thick enough and moistens skin.
doesn't irritate my eyes
it is non greasy and absorbs rather quickly.
too drying for my combination skin
leaving a greasy layer right on the surface
i also suspect it clogged my pores a bit
i chocked it up to lack of moisture in the cream
this product is thick
it just sits on the surface of my skin
soften up with a facial oil before using this clenser
pick up all the leftover gunk
this dries my skin
have noticed that it leaves yellow stains on my white towels
i don't see a reduction in pores like it says.
it is also not foamy
maybe use a thinner plastic that makes it easier to squeeze the bottle?
it produces a gentle foam
it dried out my skin
oily in some parts
didn't see a change in my pores
it also caused my pores to clog.
it is still drying on my oily/combo skin
it irritates my skin
my pores look smaller
didn't change my pores or my skin
i didn't help shrink or blur my pores
i don't have very large pores
how it will "get to the root" of problem pores
my pores were unchanged.
sephora came me store credit- i have visible pores
my forehead is super oily
it didn't shrink my pores
if i had large pores
the pores around my nose
my makeup settles around the pores
the product flaked once it dried all over my freshly cleaned face
it probably made my pores on my nose 4% smaller
picture porefect does not minimize the appearance of pore
my pores seems smaller
without looking ashy or pale
didn't really minimize my pores even after extended use
i think it helps my pores look smaller.
my pores did shrink though
i'd rather have large pores
use powder to cover up
you'll end like a frying pan with these
correct my dry patches
it made my skin crawl & feel oily.
burn after using it
doesn't irritate my eyes
especially the daily face peels
it leaves an unnatural sheen behind
it cleared out my deep pores
especially because it's marketed toward declogging pores for oily skin
bought a $40 piece of dried clay
its like washing your face with water
rubbing the wet bar over it
the clay/soap leaves the skin soft
was hoping for this to shrink my pores
it wasn't the "deep clean" or "pore cleansing" quality i expected
keep it in a soap container that is water tight
used it as a body mask
what it did was clog my pores
dried out my skin
the clay doesn't transfer to the skin
it also dried it out
it dries out quickly
so after you moisten the bar
it doesn't foam or suds up
felt like it left a "film" after rinsing
this cleanser caused me to break out on my cheeks
the consistency is like booger
it is not foamy at all.
it started to clog my sink up
since it doesn't foam up
it sort of dissolves the mascara on the lashes
it takes forever to foam
i don't like the gel texture because it takes forever to foam up
i noticed some reductio in pore size
i would describe the sensation as imagine liquifying the gum "big red"
i washed my face
use a rag to wash it off
it stained everything it touched
this clay is called "deep pore cleansing clay"
summarizing: if your boyfriend wants a pore cleansing solution
while this one becomes runny
drying out my sensitive skin
once rinsing off with water
once wiping off with cotton pads
does not help clean pores
you have to gently pat onto dry skin
then tissue or wash off
it seems like my pores have been clogged
kind of exaggerates my pores when i apply makeup
even with a pore filling primer
if you don't have super large pores
it also doesn't absorb into the skin
it clogs your pores.
other skin care underneath it
it made my nose oily
nose get pretty oily
while providing moisture to my dry spots
made my oily skin more oily.
it seemed to absorb quickly
you can sort of "melt" it by rubbing your fingers or palms together
my skin was so dried out even my lips
occasionally use their glycolic peel before or their overnight renewal cream after
it sinks in quickly
unfortunately after just 2 uses i've noticed the pores on my nose
absorbs quickly into the skin
sticky feeling after application
reduces existing dark spots
chin get super dry
i washed my face
drying for my face
it reminds me of clorox wipes
it should be concave
i recently got this eye contour gel
soothing when i apply the gel on my eyes
the gel to me felt a little runny.
there because they often clog pores
apply every morning and pat gently.
it does disappear quickly into the skin
dab/press it onto my face like i would a face oil
tried it both ways: thin layer after washing my face
it moisturizes but only temporarily!
almost imperceptible unpleasant tingling sensation around my nostrils
yes, i patted instead of rubbing, etc.
i cleansed my skin
i noticed creasing under my eyes
unblemished skin so that after putting on spf
is impossible--the product starts to peel off.
it kinda tightens your face
my face instantly pruned up
it stripped away all my natural moisture
manages to control my oily skin
although it cleans my pores
larger pores on my nose
it burns like fire from hades
get pores-no-more
oiliness without over-drying
it did help my pores
dirt from my skin
it has a tiny pump dispenser
my pores did not shrink at all!
it also leaves a greasy layer or sheen after i put on my makeup as well
it does give light moisture
because i wanted to buy something to shrink my pores
my pores didn't shrink
not to mention it seemed to create more clogged pores
stick with the pores no more vaccuum cleaner alone
have done a mud mask
well absorbed by the skin
the jar is empty
my pores are still huge
the vacuum treatment quickly loosens blackheads
however, the effect is big, empty pores.
minimize the look of my pores
my pores are still there
or extremely large pores
as you start massaging them into your skin the product starts balling up
as for the pores
i noticed smaller pores on my cheeks only.
my nose and forehead pores remained unchanged.
it would be the pores no more--fabulous pore "filler"
mineral makeup without visible pores showing
it doesn't have much of a cooling sensation
the air brushes by
creating a nice evaporating effect
the bottle suggests putting the gel in the freezer for the best effect
slather that on instead?
this burnt my skin
comes in a regular squeeze tube with screw off cap
conservatively pumped the gel out
the gel created a tingle
additionally, it left a residue on my face.
after the product absorbed
was left with a residue
sticky residue on hands but not on my arms
rich ingredients just wouldn't soak into my skin
it was like vegetable shortening just smeared on my face
its greasy and doesn't nourish the skin at all.
this cream is so thick
never was absorbed into skin
like the tube packaging rather than the normal tub form
it feels like it absorbs in
my pores are the same
doesn't get absorbed well.
i am now in love with ddf oil-free moisture dew with spf 15
i like that this dissolves quickly into my skin
my face touches the pillow
it goes on well under powder foundation.
flaky underneath with this layer of creamy shine sitting on top :
my make up oxidized
this makes my skin feel like a grease trap!
this moisturizer does not quickly absorb into the skin
i felt goo sitting on top of my skin.
clogged my pores for a few days after using
now i'm having to wear liquid
this one absorbs quickly
use powder to control the shine
i found that it burns on application
it just flakes off with the foundation.
which causes my sensitive skin to break out
left a greasy sheen on my face
so dry that it peels off
dirty even after washing
it is foamy like everyone says
it does the job without stripping my skin of moisture
this product doesn't absorb into my skin
it leaves a waxy film that then rolls/pills off
liquid foundation or cream foundation
hoping it would dissipate
the dermadoctor actually balled up into tiny clumps as though the cream was a solid coating on my face
doesn't irritate my eyes
leaves my eyes greasy
now it simply had a layer of dried moisturizer on top
definitely hydrates your under eyes
goes on smooth and sinks in.
thick white stuff that doesn't absorb or blend easily or quickly
it smooths on nicely
as well as my brow bone area
it dries my skin to where i have to wear another eye cream to combat the dryness
i exchanged for the 3 strip lemon peel
the ole lemon strip peel is 100% better
this was like putting clear useless goo on :(
smooth after i wash it off
dry/oily/combination/sensitive skin
my pores were clogged

after about 10 min it like melts on your face
would absorb into my skin
protects from strong winds
this cream made my eyes water
it is too watery
my skin is getting dryer
it dried out the skin under my eyes
it makes my eyes tear uncontrollably
eliminate the dry flakes on my chin
it leaves some stickiness
completely through the container
additionally once it dried
this product peels and pearls up under makeup.
the cream is easy to spread
it disappears fast upon application
rolls off of my skin
the consistency is runny
felt as if my pores were clogged
also very messy and runny.
it peels off like flakes even one or two hours after i applied it
than move onto applying my oil-free sunscreen
it completely dried out my skin
peels in a weird way
fuss-free moisture to your skin
it makes my bangs oily too
more plump with moisture
i've used thicker creams that have penetrated way better than this product did
it's thick, creamy and absorbs slowly.
did nothing but clog my pores.
looks real greasy until it soaks in
allow five minutes to allow it to absorb before concealer
upon application it separates into a watery substance
even thicker glue-like substance
kinda like the consistency of white glue?
it doesn't absorb quickly
so my eyelids feel greasy after applying it
the cream is so sticky
the consistency eeeww hate it its like glue
it's basically a sticky, gooey cream.
i've used a full tube without residual hydration or wrinkle reduction
dry consistency of this formula requires a lot of tugging to apply
hope in a tube eye
this cream is thick

plumping up the fine lines
wrinkles with the building up of collagen from underneath the skin
the dead skin cells that help create the fine lines

my skin is white as paper
i swab it over my eye area and lashes at night.

the word "lotion" makes it sound thicker than a clear liquid
it's just a clear liquid that resembles a toner
it leaves a weird feeling that prevents you from smoothing your h
it foamed up really nicely
it left a waxy film on my face after washing
my toner pad would be covered in foundation
it leaves an icky film on skin
the gel formation for oily skin was so much better
it strips all moisture out
after i rinsed off my face
need to use a face towel or microfiber cloth to wipe it off it doesn't just rise off
after washing with this i felt like my face was coated in grease
it takes a while to absorb
except for how oily it makes my eyelids
i will finish up my tub
it truly replenishes moisture to dry
i still have droplet looking spots under my eyes.
as it gets absorbed
it dried my skin out completely
the flare ups dissipated
with my combo/oily skin
it sits on the ski and feels super sticky.
this made my dry spots dryer
used to have oily skin
chapped when using this product
it absorbs too quickly and leaves my skin dry.
it left a slight residue on my skin.
controlled my oiliness a little
for the oily parts
flaked off into pieces everywhere
i rinsed gently with luke warm water
you can actually see the rose petal pieces in the mask
the mask felt sticky as it dried down
it gave me pores after each use!
i think the muddy dark color of the mask soaks in too much
or the fresh water cooling the skin on a hot day
it's not an ordinary face mask that dries up rock solid
the product was clogging my pores
my face was covered in deeply imbedded pimples
tried the benefait 50spf fluid also
i pat it onto my skin for it to absorb
there's white residue on my face

which wasn't a result from scrubbing
scrubbed by eyes the same amount

cheeks hoping to minimize the appearance of my pores
did not hide pores
i could still see my pores
overall a pretty good pore filling/smoothing primer with a powder like finish
i expected it to fill in my pores seamlessly
it fills in pores & quite light.
this primer is amazing for reducing the appearance of pores
it appears as if i applied it with a wet kitchen sponge
even though it did hid pores
it makes me look like a frying pan
it did help my pores
despite the pore issue-it comes out pigmented
pore perfecter-so yes
even my smallest pores
the primer reduced my pore size
my pores are still very visible
instead clogged some of my pores
i tend to have terrible oily skin along with pores
it was super runny

it still was oil absorbent at least
it doesn't erase pores
the pores look a little smaller
only problem is that it's tinted yellowish
this helped fill my large pores
it also seemed to clog my pores
it definitely minimized my pores
this primer will cause foundation any foundation to oxidize within minutes of applying
really soaks in fast
clogged skin any worse
then one day sephora gave me a sample of ddf oil free moisture dew
product sits on top of skin doesn't go into pores
smells like hair grease

i love the korres rose peel

then have to finish off with a toner to remove the remnants of make up
scrubbed onto my eyelids
i love take the day off lids lashes
had to rinse my eyes under water for minutes to get rid of the product
burns my eyes when i use.
it also did not remove my urban decay big fatty mascara after it had run down my cheeks
my skin was dry as a bone and it burned.
seems like something in the lotion must dissolve the printed lettering
that removes the print on the glass bottle
such sticks to your face
it is the stickiest cream i've ever put on my body
it helps dry flaking skin.
it makes my eyes water
it leaves a shiny oil sheen under your eyes until it absorbs
i tried putting on pencil liner
the product doesn't absorb into the skin
the cream doesn't get absorbed well
it barely takes off my mascara and liquid liner.
plus it broke me out w clogged pores.
it absorbs quickly and that's it.

it dried out my skin
or is it that it leaves my skin stripped of all moisture?
this was super drying
the oiliest skin types
it does foam well
it's currently sitting underneath my bathroom sink
after i rinse the foam away
slight friction when i gently touched my face
i didn't feel any friction on my skin when i rubbed it gently
i don't' have anymore waxy type residue experience
my checks were flushed
it do like how it lathers up into a thick foam
only need tiny bit of this cleanser to get foamy feelings on my skin
just the tiniest pea sized amount is needed to work up a very generous foamy lather
it is light and absorbs to the skin fast.
so take this with a grain of salt
it contains a white powder which is probably great for normal/oily skin
in fact it feels like the powdery solution is sucking out all my moisture
my cheeks are usually dryer
it is light but really runny.
it all starts flaking off

left my nose dry
it completely dried out my nose just in 4 washes
my pores felt clogged
applied it in weird globs around my face
then when i tried rinsing it off
i feel like scraping it off with my nails.
it drys almost instantaneously
i found the gel to be greasy
never really absorbed into my skin
coats around the eyes
when it seeps in near corners
i wish it has a metal roller ball applicator instead
i find this foam cleanser leaves my skin with a powdery feeling
dries my skin out
the clear gel formula glides on my skin
it makes my eyes water
as a result my skin would overcompensate by secreting extra oil
i ended up with clogged pores
it does tighten my huge pores on my cheeks though ---
have seen no difference in the size of my pores or the amount of impurities
it leaves a residue that must be washed off with warm water
it doesn't deep clean pores or detoxfy in any way
the difference in my pores was almost unnoticeable
usually go for more detoxfying masks of peels
doesn't even clen out pores
it didn't remove any of my black heads or shrink any pores
tisi product claims to "this mask reduces the appearance of pore size
" reduces the appearance for the 5 minutes after your rub it off
didn't do a great job at minimizing my pores
(bottle design is nice but tip dries up a bit)
that my pores would be visibly clean
the product didn't even coat my face smoothly
it just clumped up
it clumped on my skin instead of spreading
this mask goes on creamy and dries tight.
the instructions are also confusing when it says "the mask can be removed by gently rubbing the skin with finger tips"
i still have to wash off the residue.

all the particles seem to dissolve completely
the "new formula" added orange peel extract
its very watery with tiny beads.
i want it to get deep into my pores
this was really runny
instead of being a gritty exfoliate i noticed it was a smooth wash
this one is just liquid
the exfoliating agent didn't effectively unclog my pores
this product burned my oily
more like a thick silicone cream
i started developing clogged pores
it seems to instantly shrink pores
even if i haven't recently exfoliated
the only way it sort of moisturized was when i used a serum underneath

this cleanser leaves a very thick layer of residue on my skin
i soaked a cotton pad
this really cleans deep down
it dissolves make-up quite well
it feels a little stickier
the argan oil dispensed very quickly
it also clogged my pores .
might have even clogged more pores
as everytime you open this product the argan oil oxidizes
had to wipe off the excess off with a tissue
i used the oil in my hair
the oil didnt penetrate my skin even after 30min of having applied it
i kept wiping layers of it off my skin
this product feels sticky going on then soaks right into my shin
you want to moisturize deeper into your skin
slippery gel texture that glides over skin easily
hyaluronic acid is a humectant which means it draws in water from the air into your skin
it's know for clogging pores
my face became drier
you would then apply the product followed by a topical application of water mist which would then plump the product on the skin
lead to some of the misted water being absorbed into the skin to continue the hydrating
never absorbed into my skin
the product dried my skin
leaving no moisture behind
the product either evaporated since its supposed to use moisture from air to moisturize
putting it on damp skin
it also dries ridiculously quick
clogs my pores making me breakout
it almost feels like mineral oil
although it absorbed quickly
it doesn't smudge or cake up
chin look like an oil slick
protect me from the sun
i notice my make up stick and clumps.
this product along with the rest leaves a greasy residue that makes the face irritatingly shiny
it would melt into my skin
it burns and tingles when i put it on.
thick the product was
felt like it was clogging my pores
it did absorb quickly
too light weight with a white sheen for olive skin types which fades
it's starting to peel off
redden like it did with this product
it also soaked into my foundation brushes
crepey-ness on upper lids
it seemed to zap out any moisture as soon as it was absorbed
it dried and irritated my eyelids.
the skin on my eyelids began to peel off
it disappear in 3 uses
almost elmer-glue-like consistency
i noticed my pores clogging up badly
i already have enlarged pores
it does absorb oils
kept my oils at bay
hourglass mineral veil primer
didn't absorb into to skin
a lot less oil than normal was on the oil blotting sheet
it doesn't spread evenly on your skin
i do believe it clogged my pores
i apply sun screen over it
because cottonseed dries you out horribly
this will strip the moisture out!
it lathers so well
i normally use caudalie foam
it doesn't irritate the skin.
completely stripped of natural oils
it clogs my pores in areas on my face that are usually quite clear
only a light dusting of pressed powder
absorbed by skin quickly
rubs off into little pieces
is a lightweight cream that isn't thick
it also crumbles if i apply this
my skin immediately started peeling on my chin.
your skin will peel
it caked under my eyes
dry out in flakes
the cream instantly smoothes the lines
it squirts out all over
or the bathroom mirror
when i went to use the pump a really runny liquid came out
it tightened my lids
had to unscrew the top to dab the cream on my fingertips to apply
the night cream was drying.
when the sweat starts pouring
even then i peel
the combination of the 2 has completely dried out my skin
it really peeled my skin
burnt my skin after 2 applications
as far as peel
my skin is peeling
it burns when i use my usual moisturizer to try to calm down the flaking
product burned my skin
works great to reduce oily skin.
i like that it absorbs pretty quickly
absorbs into skin like a serum
immediately noticed dry patches
my skin should not be peeling at cheeks
it actually absorbs really fast.
sticky residue on my face
this product makes me breakout because it clogged my pores
left a lot of oily residue on my skin
there's actually a smaller tub inside with an awkward pump dispenser
the orange peel extract is a bit overwhelming
it completely dried out my skin
overall it is drying out my skin caused dry patches on my cheeks
massaged with water as a cautionary practice
scrub which of course irritates the skin
leaves an odd residue
dried out my skin
lathers well just using a little
it dried out my skin
it foams up really well
it builds a good lather
depending on your skin
when you twist it close, more oozes out.
first off i'm 34 with oily / combo skin.
i love the pump that makes sure that your fingers don't contaminate the jar
it has a pump inside which keeps the rest of the product safe from germ contamination
it began to dry powdery
absorbs into the skin quickly
after unscrewing the pump top
they hide a small amount of the moisturizer in the top of the jar near the pump
i found it sticky
didn't provide my skin with sufficient moisture
like your pillowcase or your towel after you wash your face
simultaneously has flaky dry patches
while it dries the blemish it wrecks havok on the skin
sensitive skin that takes days to recover
it leaves the skin around the zit pealing
my skin is peeling off because it over dries it
my skin is on the drier side
if you apply a thin layer
it could be a good base for a mineral powder because of the waxy finish
my pores are on the aging/larger side
it readily absorbs into the skin
i've also noticed that this gets clumpy like the moisturizer
almost like there's silicone in it
it stays greasy for a while
my skin absorb it quickly
always dries my skin out
my pores seem smaller
you cant unscrew the cap
smelled like tooth paste
this was an ok cream that absorbs well into the skin
the container looks like a tub
the title, "deep tissue repair" is pushing it.
as for the jar
this one is a little thin/runny
my skin around my cheeks
i find cones to be pore-clogging
it didn't seem to hydrate down into the layers of my skin
thick, dimethicone shiny slick on the skin.
i didn't realize that the dispenser spits out an extra drop of oil each time the depressor is released
somehow an oily film leaks out.
i layer it under nourish
a little droplet flies out
the bottle also leaks a bit
the whole bottle is greasy
it does soak in relatively quickly
which eventually clog my pores
i've yet to experience a "moisture-locking treatment" or a "luminous glow
this product totally clogged my pores
it's like putting another layer of oil on top of my oily skin
then it turns into a silicone primer-y feel.
quickly gets into the skin
silicone acts as a barrier
its for dry skin
do love how it cleans my oily combo skin
impurities in one step"
it lingers on your skin
left a white residue even with my clarisonic
over strip skin oil
i washed my skin
not very much on the foaming sensation.
it does draw out impurities from the pores.
drips all over the side
dried out my skin immediately!
the bottle fell off the bathtub edge into the tub
it clogs my pores every time i use it
my eyes started watering
shelled out a $100 for a tub of this
it just sat on top of my exfoliated skin
pores seemed a lot smaller
moisturizes w/out being too heavy
pigment lightening gel or murad t-zone pore refining gel
you have to use very sparingling otherwise it kind of peels/flakes off
have never had it fill my pores
deep pores on my nose
i cleaned my face
i used a thin layer of product and nothing.
onto the next blackhead extractor
you rinse it away
neither for the pores.
that its supposed to bring blackheads to the surface
this is one of the many blackhead clearing/pore refining products in my collection
dries too quickly for me.
pores seemed to remain clogged.
i still have visibly deep pores
yes it does bring your blackheads to the surface
it just dries my skin
it works great for minimizing pores
dried out my skin
my pores don't feel tighter or smaller.
also the product dried in the tube
it did not clean/vacuum stuff out of my pores.
while the vacuum cleaner works okay over time/with continual use to minimize blackheads
the product comes in a cheap squeeze tube
pores are noticeably tighter
i tried it with the pore strips
my pores are no smaller.
i wanted it to clean out the larger congested pores around my nose
didn't really vacuum clean
works on my nose but dried it out.
very large pores on his nose
blackheads starting to poke out
pressed out all the gunk in his nose
it absorbs very quickly.
it might work if your blackheads are the size of peppercorns
my pores looked bigger
i will stick to my clay masks.
sort of slippery serum that absorbs readily
thin liquid is not very smoothing.
it is absorbed very quickly
this product dries my eyes out.
less wasteful to unscrew the cap
shoots the contents all over
liquid came out of the pump
which was like how dead hair follicles smell when you dye them
my face just peeled
all i've gotten is dry, flaking skin.
my whole face peels
it completely dried out my skin
this mask bleached the tips of my eyebrows
i don't feel it hydrates or helps with dark circles
it dried my skin out fast
leaves a residue on my face
it clogged my pores
my face gets oily
dry-ish on the cheeks
doesn't absorb that well into the skin
the silky texture melts right into the skin
moisture lasts through the night
my pores looked enormous
i cleaned my face
massaged it onto my face
there the containers was washed out
smoothing the entire face
i used up the jar
although the skin surface turns over
it smells like the puss that oozes out of an infected wound
this product absorbs quickly
like fish rotting in the sun bad.
pour fish oil over raw chicken
all this did was clog my pores
the lingering smell of dirty copper pennies
it lingers on your fingers
used the whole jar
absorbed quickly into the skin
i normally use the moisture surge
and my face wasn't oily and shiny.
you only a light dab on your finger
i've noticed this whether i use the cream on my lids
it is a light cream that lightly moistens the eye area
the mixture between cream
this dries my skin out more
it stripped all moisture from my cheeks which are a normal skin texture
removed all the dirt
rubbing it all over your face
the worst part is that the smell clings to your baby hairs
it stripped my combination skin of all moisture
its less foamy for one and every.
i still notice traces of eyeliner
it rubs on the bottom of my eyes
gently wiping my under eye
it has a nice applicator
the roller dispenses too much product
this is very drying under the eyes
i do keep the roller in the fridge
when you use the metal roller to depuff
it dispenses too much liquid
it takes too long to absorb into the skin.
cools my puffy eyes
there is a tingling sensation while it dries
the metal ball roller felt great when applying.
the cold metal tip applies a tingle-y liquid.
i think because of this it ended up clogging my pores
no matter if i apply a thin layer or a thick one
it just sticks to my dry patch
rather settles atop my skin
it pilled on my skin
smells like burnt plastic and asphalt.
it also worsens the oily nose look as the day progresses
cheeks from past sun damage
absorbs quickly which i like
watery that even as gently
good, clean pump dispenser.
the product possibly even clogged my pores since it was like using two moisturizers
i read that can really block pores.
many fine spider veins on my cheeks
my pores are still the same
it drips all over the place
it drips down so fast
like the opaque bottle
it does make you skin smother
this oil is very liquidy
made sure it was rinsed off completely
massage onto a dry face
then wet your hands and massage face again.
it is drying after wash
i love the fact that it absorbs quickly
it does mattify however it peels off when rub my skin
the oiliness returns very quickly
my skin is normally a combination of oily/dry
it does absorb nicely when applied
i felt like it clogged my pores
t pores no more
it dried my skin out
my skin feels oily by midday
t dried up the area around my cheeks
it left white residue all over from the product formula
face as oily as usual
it increased oil on my cheeks
oily after using this product
it keeps your face from drying out
t pores no more
this one is clogging my pores
the lid to the jar is glued tight
leaves my skin dry
replaces it with oiliness
i quickly began rinsing
rubbing my face to try
it didn't absorb quickly
bits of mascara even with lots of massaging
even after multiple washes.
the face feels artificially oily
especially the black peel of mask
to pull out the impurities
for a couple minutes after rinsing it off the eyes
it irritates your eyes a bit
leaves an oily film in my eyes after washing.
after i go over my skin with my toner on a cotton pad
the pad is covered in dirt
dry my skin out
i got tiny colorless bumps like my skin was purging
lines are slowly smoothing.
it ripped my skin appart
it dried out my face, and irritated my sinuses.
with the sample i noticed firmer skin.
absorbs really quickly with little to no scent
it feels kinda waxy after it settles in
the product didn't absorb into my skin.
everybody's skin reacts differently on different ingredients
2 oz for $20 while the red clay wash is $24 for 4
i love my red clay wash
the pump squirts out a lil at a time
it literally just adds another layer of product.
rritate my check bone area skin
securely clicks between the open
if i was to put a metal spoon in the fridge
the cold steel ball both work to reduce puffiness
dries out my eyelids
if forms white precipitates on my lashes
a lack of sleep exacerbates them
i like the rollerball because it lends a cooling effect
then it just sits under your eye until it dries creating a slight clear layer
while the rollerball does a nice job massaging the bags under my eyes
the cool metal ball is soothing to the eyes
the roller applicator is a nice idea.
pulls at my skin
the product doesn't dispense evenly
any cooling item such as cold cucumber slices of even a cold spoon would do more than this serum
the metal rolling ball feels cool
the cooking effect of the metal ball feels amazing
an ice cube would do the same
layers well underneath daily moisturizer
the corrective element is a light wax
foundation or pressed powder will lift the wax
coat your applicator or come off on your fingers
a light dusting of loose powder
best to wear at night since once the serum dries
it begins to flake off
just a bottle filled with silicone
the serum left a greasy/waxy residue on my face that flaked off every time i touched it
i found that it clogged my pores the morning after applying even the thinnest layer to my face
thick for my oily skin
your concealer will start to clump up all under your eyes
it is very drying
someday i'll find an eye cream that not only hydrates
it absorbs quickly and moisturizes effectively.
my eyes lids still droop.
it instantly hydrates the skin under my eyes
my under eye feels sticky after applying this cream
it smooths the skin under my eyes
it felt like i was applying goo around my eyes
the spatula they provide is useless
this product is sticky
targets toxins in the heart of the cell
found it too drying
i also use the shiseido brush
the creme itself is thick and feels greasy.
because cold plasma eye is expensive
within 5 minutes my eyeliner was migrating
it also evaporated into a thick brown tacky substance
i agree that it absorbs quickly
forehead from this product
it leaves an oily film since it doesn't absorb completely
it began sloughing around my mouth
on my brow bone
the overnight eye balm
this cream burned my skin
once it soaks in
my make-up smudged
this spf rolled off my skin.
the 5 in 1 face cream spf 30 did not absorb into my skin
stayed on the surface as a greasy film
that there is a residue
dried out my skin
this leaves a white residue when you rub it in
leaves my oily skin ten times more oily
i loved it the first day its light absorbs quickly
it's easily peeled/rubbed off
the product started flaking off my skin
the product flakes on my skin once dry
rub your other product in
leaves no oily residue
then my skin becomes oily again
almost like the texture was clogging my pores
this neither cleans nor clears.
leaves a heavy feel after rinsing
rinsed it off immediately
then rinsing it off
wanted clay for a deeper cleanse
this left a residue on my face even after using a washcloth
after you rinse it off
when my skin usually clears up
pollutants you pick up from the city
the pad is full of oily
it does provide good moisture without adding to my oiliness
this ended up clogging my pores
it is a bit drying
my pores seem huge
it did slightly minimize my pores
it also adds an extra layer of grease to my face
didn't remove a single blackhead
it's peels off as shown in the video
grime from your clogged pores
the videos online show all this gunk in the peeled off mask
the pores on my nose
peels gently, but did not remove black heads.
sort of like elmer's white glue.
stick with homemade masks
on such a thick heavy gross coat of this for like 45
i applied a very thick layer.
felt like peeling elmers glue off your skin.
i put on a very thick layer to the point where it was dripping off
i washed my face first with warm water
i applied thick layer
it pull little of my blackhead off my pores
it doesn't minimize the appearance of pores
i used a nice even thick layer as stated for directions
if anything this felt like a wax more than removing blackheads
it also did nothing for the pores or removing black heads
honestly it probabaly is glue and charcoal.
this dried out my skin.
i feel like it did help to exfoliate some of the dead skin cells off my face
sensitive skin with large pores
charcoal peel-off masks are bad for pores
reddned my cheeks clogging my pores
i can notice it has blurred my pores
i looked like a sweaty oily mess in the sun
your pores are really big
it peels off nothing
i'll stick to my pore strips.
why it'll rip my baby hairs around hairline out
if it's blackheads you want to remove your money is best spent on pore strips
i dread peeling it.
you need a thick layer to get it to peel.
this won't help you with pores or clarifying.
made my face flushed.
it does not work like pore-strips
pros: cleaned and decongested my t-zone.
it does not remove any impurities
blackheads or leaves your skin looking luminous
it takes about 40 mins to dry
peels off very easily
the mask didn't have much residue or blackheads on it post-peel
even after removing it by wiping it off with a warm cloth
my pores looked no different
it doesn't peel off easily
usually i had to wipe it off with a warm wash cloth
then it barely peels anything off
when it comes to the peeling off
it does nothing for my pores
it removes baby hairs but not blackheads.
you need to apply a thick layer
don't waist your money
this soaks into my skin
i only use a dab or so
because dipping my fingers in the jar seems unsanitary
does not absorb into the skin easily
blended into skin easily
was absorbed into the skin very fast
as a wrinkle corrector not so muck
absorbs right into your skin
the cream was waxy and hard to apply.
it absorbed super fast
i ended up spreading lipstick
when mixed with water
fairly good cream but tender to block my pores.
didn't block my pores and my skin was great.
maybe it was clogging my pores too much.
there is no moisture in the air
stinky, useless, and too much silicone.
balances out my oily skin
doesn't absorb very quickly
it made my dry patches even dryer
allow it to "melt" into my skin better
until the product soaked in
the eye cream ended up turning a bit runny on my skin
a clean canvas for eye makeup
some creasing in the inner corners
my outer eye area began to peel
melts into the skin which i like
absorbed in to my skin quickly
it must be rinsed off well
because i love all of bobbi brown stuffs
made pores appear smaller
left me ultra oily
it instantly revives your skin from any dryness
how quickly it sinks into my skin is luxurious
absorbs well into the skin after 10-20 mins
it does absorb quickly
leaves my skin still craving moisture
it completely dried out my eyes
it irritates my eyes
still doesn't glide on easily
it doesn't absorb into the skin completely
this eye cream completely damaged my skin texture
this product left a sticky white residue on my face after drying
feel like dried elmer's glue on your face.
i saw "use tissue to wipe away/blend any white residue"
the more i used a tissue to wipe them off
turns into a gooey mess
using a damp cloth to blot away the film
it's is great on pores!
then the white residue formed.
slightly wetting my face after applying
the white residue will still form
she tried to blot it off with a wet towel
if you use it under liquid foundation it just disappears
it just leaves white steaks or white crumbles
product leaves this cloudy residue
it really erases lines
still makes liquid foundation look thick
oh if you use a wet cloth after a thick layer dries
u pat white residue off so face is damp again you can use damp paper towel to make gel ball up
seems to deeper clean maybe lightly exfoliate
i've used the lashes to die
it's like a primer in the sense that it "fills in" your pores
using it as a mask
you get a white patchy residue on skin
more than a damp cloth
white residue forms within minutes
i tried everything: a heavier application with "residue touch ups" to feather out the white film
even with applying a "skim coat" of this product
it left a white chalky residue
it smooths out lines
the product is a thick beige gel that is applied to the under eye area
after drying there was a thick white powdery residue left on the skin
the white residue that it leaves behind
for the white residue
dries out skin so after 3 days of use i had skin flaking off
patting it very gently with a damp washcloth
it leaves a white residue on the skin
plus, the chalky white residue made a mess.
have to swipe a damp cloth over my face
product lifted my slightly deep folds around my mouth awesome till you have to rinse off the white residue
i did try just dabbing water
crusty residue left once it's dried
"splashing" off the white residue
i rinsed my face gently
the tube kept getting clogged.
it kept drying in clumps on ny eye area.
finally i tried wiping with a wet q-tip once the crust had dried on to my skin
clogged my pores like crazy
it cakes up your pores so you have white dots all over your face
leaves your skin sticky all night
sensitive skin that is extremely prone to clogged pores
once my skin is clogged
clogged pores started to come back after i've finally tamed my skin from a horrible skin congestion from a lactic acid product i was using
chin without any moisture
the lotion would clump into little balls
it also clogged my pores.
added extra moister to my skin
this absorbs well, but only spf 30.
this product is thick
does not absorb into skin
i can never squeeze the product out of the tubes through the roll-balls
left an oily residue
use a cold compress before applying
the roller balls are a great design
the gel is a little heavy
takes forever to be absorbed
the applicator tip is kind of cool.
over dried the under eye skin
the liquid is thicker which is an odd sensation
a gel gilled eye mask works better .
the 3 roller balls would be genius
the gel comes out
the metal balls give a nice
cooling sensation to the under eye area
for the gel to be completely absorbed
my easily clogged pores
felt sticky after application
this cream dries my oily skin out.
it doesn't absorb into your skin
it sits on your skin rather than getting absorbed
my checks are burning.
it dried my eyes out
hard paste that you have to scrape out of the tub
it sits on top of the skin and doesn't absorb.
i guess the intent is to avoid contaminating the product by putting your finger into the jar
because if you touch the spatula with your finger
then put the spatula in the jar
easier to use a eye/lip cream packaged in a squeeze tube
somehow make the purple that shows through thin undereye skin magically disappear?
even next to the tear ducts
the cream absorbs well
lightly rubbed in the product
it left a coating that turned into white flakes as it dried
creates dry patches under my eyes
whenever i use it rains my lips
it dries my upper lip
this cream is fast absorbing
saw it was because the eye cream is actually is a pouch inside the canister--the canister is not actually full
every time i push the nozzle
you can unscrew the top
squeezed out the remaining cream into a small makeup container
every time i go into the bathroom there is a puddle of oil under the bottle
the nozzle is so short you can't pump the oil in your h
i realize that oil isn't supposed to clog pores
large pores in t zone
the large jar without any kind of spatula is unpleasant to use
it clogged my pores
it makes my pores look huge
when you uncap it
it will cause fat granules under eyes if you use it too often
applied to clean dry face
i used it as a summer eye moisturizer because it absorbed quickly
when you apply it it conceals problem area
fell in love with the moisture bound eye treatment gel
the product absorbs relatively easily
many products penetrate skin beyond the dermal layer in more effective ways
slathered some on my clean face
that whole white part unscrews off
is that it absorbed fast into my skin
my face turned into a shiny oily mess
i ended up rinsing my face with water
patting it dry to get rid of the excess
did nothing to reduce my pores
my pores didn't get smaller or minimize.
the serum absorbs quickly
did not shrink pores at all
it didn't shrink my pores whatsoever
envy people with small pores
my pores don't appear smaller or clearer
f your pores are medium instead of large
my pores on my cheeks are still big
did not feel it helped in refining pores
nothing happened to my pores on my nose
it does nothing for my pores
did nothing to refine my pores
it also does not make your pores smaller.
it looked like it mightve shrunk my pores
my pores seemed bigger
serum felt good, didnt see a difference in pores.
i still have large huge pores.
most of the products in the "pore diminishing" category go on like silicone gel -- filling in
/or tightening pores to reduce their appearance
this didn't help my pores
this pore refining solution corrective serum turns your skin greasy after one or two hours from application
visibility of pores on my nose
it did help on my nasial labia folds somewhat.
wrinkly versus oily skin with deep set lines
made my skin peel just as much as a professional chemical peel
my skin began to sag without its protective layer
absorbs immediately w/no residue
which required a lot of elbow grease because the serum was so thick in the bottle
goes on smooth dries nicely
the flakes on my forehead
eruptions forming under the skin on my face
it dried out my face
i felt it clogged my pores
this one flakes off the skin
smells like regular sun screen
lifting cream along with firming
it absorbs really easily
this product dries out my skin
thick at first but absorbs quickly.
dry skin under my eyes
i saw "use tissue to wipe away/blend any white residue"
i applied the product to my eyes
the more i used a tissue to wipe them off
it did leave a powdery residue once it had dried
it leaves a white residue all over
it separated all the light reflecting particles out of my eye cream
white residue covered in glitter
it looks like glue
causes creases where it sticks the skin together
when the product dries it leaves a white residue that's very apparent
does this product firm wrinkled areas
even bought a nylon makeup brush per the directions to apply
experienced the white flaky residue
before using it on delicate eye skin
you'll see how this product pulls the skin
after drying it turned to a powdery white that was not blendable
pat on a very thin layer
dries into a hard white crust making make-up application impossible
still the residue shows up
this product tightens the skin where it is applied
it lease a crusty white residue that is impossible to get off
it dries down to a crusty residue that resembles dry skin
i try to pat away with a damp sponge
it leaves a white coating on your skin !!!
and dries out your under eye area !
dries out your eyes
it pulls the crepe right out.
it leaves a white dry residue that is hard to get off without washing your face or rubbing
it leaves a white powdery residue
still get the residue
it leaves a chunky film of white paste under your eyes
then it turns crinkly
dry bare minerals which i usually use
over the product after it dries
wait til it dries
it leave this residue
i worked amazing at smoothing my undereye bags
it dried white on my eye skin
then turned into a noticeable egg white-looking substance that i had to dab off with a damp tissue
have the bags removed surgically
why apply a product that dries out the delicate under eye area?
dries to a thin whitish powder
tightening as it dries
super greasy, doesn't wash off.
it doesn't cover pores completely
this product ends up clinging to dry patches on my skin even if i exfoliate
totally dries out my skin
the pore refining solutions instant perfector is a light weight cream that quickly minimized my large pores
this is an effective product if you tap it on your pores
it emphasized the dry patches on my cheeks
pores will appear huge.
make up will settle in lines and pores.......
it made the foundation settle into my pores
doesn't appear to be changing the appearance of my pores
my pores are often giant
it doesn't make my pores disappear
i wanted this product to work for diminishing the look of pores on my nose
my pores were visible again
it left a dry ashy look on my skin.
it doesnt really minimize my pores
after many different primers/ pore minimizers
began noticing little clogged pores on my nose
i don't have super noticable pores
the oil itself is very thick
doesn't give any boost of amazing hydration except for a greasy outer-layer on the skin
then slathering face oil on afterwards compared to this
mascara despite rubbing the oil all around my eyes
skips instead of gliding on effortlessly like an oil cleanser should
it does not dissolve
when you squirt it into a cup of water the oil just sits at the bottom
when you squirt an oil like the one from tatcha skincare it dissolves into a milk as soon as it touches water
it pulls on my skin and is sticky.
the oil is thick and didn't glide over my skin.
sticky paste all over your face
has a glue like texture until you add lots of water
it dried out my skin completely
it leaves a bit of a residue after rinsing
causes the oil to get onto the bottle
left an oily film
this stuff easily removed foundation
the instructions said to massage into skin until milky
it still didn't become milky
i swear it is like magnetized to my mouth
dissolves your makeup quickly
thin out the thick layer of goo that's left on your face
sticky texture that doesn't soak in or glide around
it dried my skin out
was very easy to rinse off my skin
it clogged my pores
it is too oily for combo/oily skin
3 pumps cover my entire face
soaks into the skin without too much of a film
it kind of sits on the skins surface without plumping things up
it seems to be mostly thickeners
s to touch other stuffs
it is thick but it absorbs quickly.
the positive is that it absorbs well into the skin
defiantly not for oily
i tried 2 pots of this stuff
everything i put on this eye cream to hydrate under neath my eyes
i wake with really oily eye lids
t was a gradual clogging of my pores i guess?
it also looked as dry as sandpaper.
it does not settle into the skin it leaves a sticky residue on top of the skin
it also seems to clog up in the pump
it absorbs quickly enough
it moisturizes okay…i usually have to apply something over it for more moisture
the eye cream started curdling to use a phrase from another reviewer

it flaked as soon as it started to soak in.

i returned to my clinique moisture surge night mask
i love how this draws out impurities without drying my skin

it smells like nail polish
i especially love peel off masks.
applied the thin layer
bosia black peel was sold out
easy to be peeled off
i realized i put on too thin of a layer
peeling off the mask
i could see the gunk being pulled out like on charcoal masks
very satisfying to peel off
at which i used my nails
i found peeling this mask off annoying; 3.
so i applied it liberally to my face.
after i do this clay mask
although i apply a thick layer
i can never peel it off when it dries
i don't know how well it cleans out my pores
put on a thin layer

then apply water to remove any residual

gunk from my skin getting removed
it also over dries my skin
tried doing a thin layer
i don't notice any difference in my pores or oiliness
doesn't rip out any hairs you accidentally cover
leaving little mask flakes around your sink
the ingredient list looks like something you'd use to dissolve asphalt
afraid of what chemical slurry i'll smear on next
i didn't find that drew out impurities
or do anything for clogged pores
didn't control my oily skin
foams up a lot which is good
didn't see a difference with pores or skin texture
was drying on my already dry skin
i unscrewed the cap
crumbles off your face after it dries semi tacky
it goes on thick
it peels off in a strange way
any other you can refrigerate
the product that comes with the pads is too liquid

it does absorb well into my skin
left a layer of residue on my skin
the moisture imparted did make under-eye products apply more smoothly

attempts to work it in result in the cream flaking off like gommage
it peeled my skin
even where it gets absorbed it leaves a shiny residue
my skin didnt absorb any of the product i applied
unfortunately it dried sticky
then resembles something of a latex balloon when you are working it into your skin
my pores were so big

s an oily mess
it doesn't soak into my skin as well as the pure argan oil

really odd, waxy balls started to form.
the cell renewal cream sits too heavily on the skin
flake off my face
it took forever to brush all the sticky
balls of goop off my face
does leave a whitish cast
hard to remove, and settles into fine lines.
while it does glide on
environmental debris in the air
fuzz from clothes sticks on me like a magnet afterward
it completely dried out my lids
you must saturate a cotton pad
it also kind of burns
it does not remove from the pores
it clogged my pores

coughs the film back out in the form of an eye booger
as it might seep into your eyes

every time you squirt product it sprays every where
product makes my eyes water
instead of minimizing creasing it makes it even worse
not so enlarged pores
pores on my face
as a solid pore filling primer, it's fine.
it didn't meld into my skin
drug store pore blurring primers do a much better job
this nars primer sat in strange clumps on tzone.
tried to dissolve it with the heat of my h
i felt it didnt smooth over my pores or fine lines
whether you'd like to blur your pores or fine lines
i returned this for the smashbox pore minimizing primer
did not fill in my pores
it did smooth the pores on my nose quite well
i love what the product does- great for filling in pores
preventing under eye concealer from creasing-
it's a tiny container and goes down fast.
it didn't reduce the appearance of my pores very much
perhaps it might do better minimizing pores
it doesn't fill my pores at all even if i blend it with my fingers
did not fill my pores or lines.
i feel that throughout the day my imperfections seep back through
i used the whole wallet draining bottle
the cap on the tube
this substance forms a seal on your skin
it basically hinders air flow to
the dimethicone will "trap" oil
it really didn't fill in my smallish pores

my oily/combination skin has more oily patches than desired
great for a top sealing layer over other moisturizers
if you rub your face after it dries

it dried out the skin on my forehead
more like i'm slapping on watered down sunscreen
this particular mask stained my towels
spreads easily on the skin
leaves your skin firm for about 30 mins after washing
just cleaned my skin
the tiny capsules burst
not only the unhygienic nature of a cream pot
it leaves combination skin oily
squeeze' white application knob does not work
the texture was very drying
also, it creases and the applicator is useless.
it was always clumping or creasing
it went on very smoothly with the applicator
i like that the applicator tip is cold
love the metal applicator however the cream seems to stay in the crease of my wrinkles/fine lines
squeeze tube was a disaster
any pressure on the tube
it just squeezes out
the metal applicator feels great for putting this on
the metal applicator feels nice under the eyes in the morning
the product oozed out of the cap.
only a tiny nub of plastic on the cap keeps the liquid in place
it dried the skin under my eyes
the product soaks in nicely.
it gets caked into my under eye wrinkles
i love the idea of applying this with the metal pad
i applied with a brush
or after applying a hot towel over your face to open up your pores for maximum effect
then use a washcloth to get everything off
clean without drying your skin
not as bad as a charcoal mask
either underneath or mixed with my regular serum
there is no lather or bubbles
wipe off with a tissue you may like this
the cloth is smaller than ordinary wash cloth
the cloth is tiny
like half the size of a normal washcloth
it also leaves a residue on the skin.
because i have large pores that easily create problems
it dries very quickly
jart+ pore medic pore minish primer
after washing it off
i did see tighter pores
this is not your typical mask that dries
nothing like a regular clay or charcoal mask
gently air dry my face i found it so tight
plumps up my dry skin a bit
rinsed it off after the described time
i wore a thin layer overnight
my nose was peeling
it left my skin dried out
rinse it off immediately and my face is all red.
the thick goopy kind
leaving it so dry my face started flaking
this cleanser is thick--not goes a long way thick
comes out in glugs
have the patience to use a micro spatula to portion the cleanser
one that is a bit more effective at removing impurities/make up
it takes a while to get it to a lather
plus, it lathered so thickly.
my skin flaked off all over my face.
it smells like i'm wearing ten layers of foundation
dirties my fingers every single time i use it
it blends seamlessly into the skin
however, the screw top basically leaks.
i finish with a translucent powder to set
this is a gel that tingles when it goes on
the fumes burn my eyes.
i hear using oils on oily skin would held reduce oil production
poured it into my body lotion
it absorbs well and is a nice cream.
it dried my skin out
gently rub it in
i noticed that this cream opens up the pores
resurfacing mask is amazing
on lids without a lot of blending or patting needed
its green goop that looks like it came out of someones nose
dried out my skin
this is a horrible eye cream which flakes
peels once it dries
it dries relatively fast compared to heavier creams
loved the cooling, quick-absorb texture.
it irritated the skin at the outer contour of my eyes
it was unusable after the heat damage
it doesn't completely absorb into my skin
felt drying on my undereye.
didn't blot the over-applied area with a tissue
the irritation lasted for hours even after i rinsed my eyes
the much cheaper nose strips pull out more gunk
the surfaces were actually peeling off
the pore strip did not take out any of my blackheads
i've used pore strips in the past
it didn't extract many blackhead
it did make my pores appear smaller
drugstore pore strips work way better then these.
their version of pore strips
takes twice as long to work as the store bought nose strips
cooling wet strip is a nice addition
also pore strip only covers nose unlike other strips that reach out further
takes twice as long as regular pore strips
the pores on my nose were just as clogged after using this product as before
save up and go get a facial with extractions.
dried out my nose area, i have normal/combo skin.
the dry patch pulled one sad little blackhead.
the wet patch made my pores look
the pore remover patch is a joke.
the pore remover portion was such a waste of time that it rendered the second patch pretty useless
i think it temporarily tightened my nose pores
i regularly use drug store nose strips
it didn't pull out my deep blackheads
don't waste your money on strips.
they clean out surface
pore strips can damage your skin.
while this product did remove more blackheads than other strips i've used
the dry strip really sticks to your face
the strip did not remove a single blackhead.
usually the drugstore strips remove at least 50 blackheads with each removal
first step removed about the same pore gunk as a drugstore nose strip
the second strip is wet
i could feel my pores being tightened
apply the dry patch
when i peeled the dry patch off
the moist patch felt nice
when the first patch dries on your face
it pulled some extra dirt out of my pores
within minutes my eyes were runny
i kept sneezing for 15 minutes
after washing it off
the smoothing effect it has on my skin
it also clogged my pores
it dries my skin a lot afterwards
just purged my skin
mine is oily combination
it wasn't a mud to oil
my nose keeps peeling
dirt out as it dries on your skin
does its job in terms of cleaning pores deeply
i tried the youthful mud

too drying for my skin.
my skin felt fine after i rinsed it off
i found this to be runny
melts right into your skin
dried my face out just like the conducting gel
what was left in the jar was the same silicone i line my bathtub with
clumps up in any of the creases around your eyes
the formula does not seep into your under eyes
leaves a film that flakes off
literally pills off once it dries
it dries and sits on my skin.
i gently wipe my tears off
the eye gel rubs off into little particles
it's pretty sticky once it "dries"
it is a thicker kind of gel
it smoothes well onto the skin.
it dries fairly quickly to a lightly tacky state.
it rubs off really easily as well
cause even more creasing
once i put it on a chemically smell becomes apparent
does not effectively absorb into the skin.
i'd often wake up with lint
my eye lids are extremely dry
it keeps balling up after a few dabs or gentle massage
my boyfriend aptly started referring to this gel as my glue stick
it did absorb quickly .
brow bone as instructions directed
it doesn't soak in
will make your eyelid stick to your browbone
this was the stickiest gel ever.
this stuff not only tingles, it burns.

my face was all flake
expired into this gross brown goo within a few months
after i rinsed it off my face was tingling
flash rinse has an amazing smell
immediately after use my skin reddened
which was metallic to my nose
the flash rinse 1 minute facial was not a winner for me
dry on the cheeks
massaged it into my face
the consistency starts off as a thick paste
it thins out a little
after wetting my fingers
that residue seems like it would clog your pores in a red-hot minute
unfortunately it's clogging my pores
more on oily side
minimizing pores or anything else
the texture is weird and it dries quickly.
still have large pores
serums by their nature absorb quickly
effectively into your skin
i applied this under my bobbi brown face oil
then it stays on its surface
it absorbs easily into my skin
this serum absorbs quickly into any area
rub it into my skin instead

it tends to congest my pores
like there's a layer of residue

then once you add water it turns to a cleansing foam
make up on wash cloth after using.
left an oily residue
its this plastic/rubber smell
it comes out of the tube like a milky gel
leaves an oily residue that requires cleansing with a different product
it did not dissolve
like plastic or solvent
after i cleansed with this
i dried my face off with a white towel
doesn't emulsify when i tried to scoop it out
kind of a clumpy gel cream.
don't like the bacteria of a jar
it has a great texture and absorbs quickly.
have oily/combination skin
it pours like water.
it sort of sits on the surface of my skin.
almost drying on the skin
the glass jar did not make it easy to scoop out the jelly product
leaves an uncomfortable oily residue
the residue is on your fingers
i inevitably drop it on my tiled bathroom floor
the entire top of the jar shattered leaving glass shards in the cleanser
maybe don't package it in a heavy glass jar
i found that after i'd rinse my face with warm water
this felt like i rubbed the blue gel school glue all over my face
leaves an oily residue
now it leaves a greasy film
the oil removes your makeup then when you add water it changes to a milky cleanser
crud off the face
i prefer to wash my face in the shower after letting the steam open up my pores
i noticed a ton of tiny sparkles on the washcloth i used to wipe this product off my skin
it left an oily layer after washing it off
it doesn't fully emulsify
left a gross film after rinsing that i could literally scrape off with my nails
went on nicely with a thicker texture than some runnier oily melting type cleansers
as though a coating was on my skin.
"eew what is this doing to my pores
aggravated my sensitive skin in the process of heat
other messy residue on the cotton pad
water does not rinse it off
feels like it will clog pores
my cheeks break out
tonnes of eye makeup still on my skin
when i added water it turned to a milky white
you must have to use a lot in increments of rinsing
love the gel texture, clean power are mid.
this stuff 0% rinses off with water.
it doesn't rinse clean or emulsify properly once you add water
it left a horrible oily residue on my skin
it never became milky
didn't rinse off fully
it doesn't foam or get milky
it leaves a gross waxy feel all over your face

when i rubbed my face i felt little flakes or piece of moisturizer flake of
in the photo there are small white particles
the more my skin dries out
it is definitely not clay foam
while i was using it i noticed that it foamed really nicely
even after continuously rubbing at my skin with the soap for minutes
dry up without drying up my skin
i noticed that my pores became clogged
the coconut oil in it clogged my pores
smearing to get it to absorb into my skin
and it smelt like sweat.
you would expect it to help with pores or skin texture
it clogged up my pores
my skin somehow felt dryer
the lapis oil sank into my skin better
then it seemed like my pores started to clog
its too runny and super difficult to stir!
” you couldn’t really get by with a super thin layer
there's nothing harmful or toxic
stored in a room temperature drawer.
skin with large pores
cleaning it off is like cleaning off a slippery slime
the cream is thick
my eyelids are literally peeling
because this jar is bulky for an eye cream
doesn't saturate into my skin
this product was drying and made my eyes puffy.
if you can baste a turkey or chicken
this thing fills the dropper then pours the serum out onto your face
the dropper wouldn't fill up
this serum gives me red bumps after i apply it.
i'll use the bottle on my chest
omg as soon as you squirt a little bit onto your finger
never fully absorbs into my skin
the texture is sticky as well.
doesn't fully absorb into my skin
smells like you rubbed ribs all over your face
and doesn't go away when layered.
it doesn't fully absorb into my skin
it's literally like rubbing thick orange juice on your face
it leaves your skin super sticky
this clogged my pores
it's a watery texture when you first pump it out
i think it's the algae in this product that causes clogged pores
no dice--saw clogged pores after one application.
it really darkens my skin even if i have sunscreen on
which hides a small container in a larger tube
it absorbed into my skin
this is a sticky mess.
it doesn't seam to absorb
leaves an orange stickiness to your face
the texture is like a silicone gel which immediately absorbed into my skin
my skin eats it up nicely
sinks into your skin immediately
my skin was also dry and stripped of moisture.
thick almost like high quality shaving cream
it never really melts down into the skin to purify it
according to the directions you rub it onto your dry face
as far as combating oil production or clearing out pores
it definitely cleans your skin
squeaky after using it
i've done an egg whites mask before
the clarisonic made the mousse dissolve into absolutely nothing
with oily-combination skin
even after massaging this into my skin for 30 seconds
the foam is really heavy
so you have to lather the foam
it disappears on your face
after washing it off i'll follow it with a sheet mask
the mouse disappears within 15 seconds of being on your skin
the fun smoothing of it onto my face
the whippy white stuff disappears as you massage it in for the treatment
this mask is very neatly packaged
the foam is nice
the egg cream sheet masks are 100 times better
after drying my face
now that foam is tingling
i want to itch my face from the tickles
after 5 mins most of the foam is disappeared
my pores look a bit more clean.
have used up two tubes
its lighter, like a gel versus a thick cream.
absorbed well so my foundation
breaks my skin out
it also leaves a sticky film on your skin.
it's sticky and never sinks in.
it also takes forever to absorb
the ungodly texture this has on the skin
irritation this serum left behind was permanently damaging
it exfoliated my face
applied it to dry skin
after patting my face dry my skin is dry
pros: cleans off make up easily.
skin feels nicely cleansed after
but the bottle leaks!
f i was in need of a "deeper" clean to get down to the pores
ncredibly drying that my skin was peeling
it clears up my occasional breakouts
it really dried my skin out it literally made my skin peel
the product keeps spilling out
its just so runny that it slips out of the cap.
it just dried out my skin
it also bleached all my towels
stripped my face of all oils.
it was drying my face
dried out after applying
it is super gummy
on clean, dry skin.
the product immediately flakes off
the product will just peel off
the hype is that it penetrates the skin.
the texture drags on the skin
ceramic slip works so much better!!!!
the blue moon leaves a residue
it also seeps into your eyeballs if you are trying to remove mascara/eye makeup
with sharp sugar crystals
get the holika holika pig clear balm
to me it would be grinding makeup into my pores.
actually has little exfoliate particles
as well as ceramic slip
it takes a bit more effort to melt
soften this balm in order to slather over the face
this is a super thick, almost waxy balm.
the serum doesn't even peel me enough to remove blackheads
it came off in little clumps
this product absorbs quickly
dry after the lotion dries on my face
i do use the sponge it comes with
doesn't help with the residue
the trace amounts of makeup it leaves behind
still left a very light oily residue on my face
also left traces of my mascara
when i use the toner with a cotton pad after
the brush seems to waste product
get the original gel
i massaged it into my skin
more like a whipped balm
love their sheet mask
