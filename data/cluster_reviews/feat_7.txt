i can't say this about most better smelling products out there
i did find the smell would disapate after a while
yes it does have a smell that reminds me of a rusty old can
many comment on the smell.
yes smells pretty bad
for me the amazing benefits are worth the smell
some people say this stuff has a strong odor
i don't get the whole "fishy" smell thing.
that will be what you smell
this product doesn't smell great
the smell is so bad
the smell reminds me of fish food
there is a faint smell that honestly
the only thing that is completely awful is the smell
i am not overly sensitive to smell
have put many unpleasant smelling things on my face
this one really is something i could not get used to the odor

so some people smell it
i'll agree 100% that this product is stinky.
it doesn't smell anything like fish
it definitely does not smell like fish.
the smell doesn't bother me at all.
it does have an odd swampy smell
the cream does indeed have a slight smell
i received a sample and no fishy smell!
if yours has an off odor, send it back!
who thinks everything smells funny
maybe a bit like a very mild paint smell
it is natural not perfume smelling like all the others that try to cover up natural smells odor in products
as for the smell, no lie its yucky.
i wouldn't say it smells like fish
honestly the smell takes about 5 mins to wear off
also doesn't smell beautifully
i mean it doesn't smell like flowers
the smell is a little funny
explain that it's giving off the odor that means it's gone bad
while i will admit that it does have a bit of a fishy/metallic odor
the smell is vanquished
smell does take some getting used to
that the smell would be offensive
you really can't smell it at all
the smell is not of this earth, i tell you!!
it certainly has smelled better
putting up with the smell
the smell dissipates and is not too bad.
commented on the vile smell
i just don't smell it anymore
no smell at all.
i personally think the product had a pleasant smell
some say the smell is too much to h
the smell barely lasts
but the smell does fade.
but he couldn't smell it at all.
despite the initial smell
i only subtracted one star for the odor....
more like a medicine like smell which is not strong to me
smelled perfume like also
smells more of a chemically smell to me
has that "fish smell" to it
i don't mind the smell at all
so first things first...it does not smell good.
i know there are a lot of reviews that say this smells like "dead fish
the smell is not that bad
not overpowering or super fishy
there is a smell that may be unpleasant when you open the jar
there is not a fishy smell that i can detect
yes, it has a funky but natural smell.
the smell doesn't last long
the smell is not long lasting
yes it does have a smell.
no longer even notice the odor
a natural ingredient in the product that produces what some describe as a fishy smell
there is an odor to the cream that is more noticeable initially
so when i say this doesn't smell that bad it probably doesn't smell as bad as some people have mentioned
the only time cold plasma ever smelled bad to me is when i got a sample
it actually smelled rotten
it smells it may have gone bad
all of the reviews about the smell
the smell isn't so bad
the smell was odd -- reminds me of kelp
i wonder if the smell lessens over time
like i said the smell doesn't last
patient with the smell
i also heard the smell was gross.
well i tried it and there was a smell to it.
well i hardly notice the smell anymore.
as far as the smell no one in my family could smell it on me after a few minutes
i don't mind the smell that much
the smell is a bit odd
the smell is totally worth dealing with
my sample had no odor at all
the smell isn't great either
now yes this product does smell sort of interesting
not everything has to smell like flowers to be powerful
smells awful but the benefits are incredible.
i love the smell as well!

so deal with the smell cause this stuff works!
doesn't really have a scent
it doesn't smell very exciting
i love the smell
so light and no heavy smell.
don't love the smell at first
it's fragrance free so there is absolutely no smell in it
the thing that bothers me is that it has a mild acid smell to it
it doesn't have the greatest of smells
no strong smell is a plus as well.
the smell is odd but you get used to it.
at first i thought it smelled gross
now it doesn't smell at all
even though the smell isn't the best
to me it just smells kind of like a clean baby?
i don't think the smell is off putting

the smell is not the best
the smell is a bit odd
it doesn't smell that nice
i don't smell anything
the smell is unique but you get used to it.

i saw some reviews saying the smell was horrible.
only reason it isn't 5 stars is it smells awful i hate the smell
i love that it doesn't have a scent
it does smell like eucalyptus right when you apply it
it doesn't have a strong smell
there is a medicine smell that isn't terrible
the one downfall is the smell.
the lotion does have an odd odor
the sulphur smell dissipates pretty quickly
once it's dry i can't smell it at all
it does smell a little funky due to the sulphur
the smell is really odd to me
almost smells like wood on fire or fireworks lol i'm not sure exactly
i even like the mild sulfur of the smell.
this product smells like far-s
c'mon that's what sulfur smells like
the smell does go away once it's been rubbed in
i love that this product doesn't have an overwhelming scent
only thing i dislike is the smell it has
yes, it smells awful, but it works so well.
i didn't smell it
said it definitely did not smell nice
it does not smell which is a plus for the hubby
couldn't get over the fishy smell in glow

i just wish it had a yummy smell.
the smell is a touch chemical for me.
i didn't like the smell at first

this way that awful smell doesn't linger
shortly after apply i started to smell something so disgusting
smell is awful and so close to unbearable.
i've learned to breathe through my mouth until the smell dissapates
however it does have a fishy smell to it.
unfortunately it does have a slightly uncomforting smell
i don't really notice a smell to it.
i am not super sensitive to smell as others
the smell is tough to overcome.
face the plasma is pretty stinky
the smell is pretty gross
my motto is, if it smells, it works.
although everyone complained of the smell
there is an odor, but not a strong fish odor.
the smell is not that bad
everytime i apply it around my eyes that fishy smell drives me crazy
and the smell doesn't fade!
previous reviewer said the smell was bad.
was hesitant because of the reviews that it smells really bad
more like a metal smell than fishy.
it's not the most pleasant smell in the world
the best way to describe the smell is
this stuff does have an unpleasant smell
the only problem is the smell!
although if i have one complaint is that it smells
it only smells when you are putting it on
once it's on your eyes it doesn't have a smell
if you are smell sensitive
i apparently have missed the smell that everyone complains about?
as i cannot tolerate bad smells
hardly notice the smell anymore
some have commented on the smell of the cream.
there is no smell whatsoever
washing can't smell it at all
this product’s scent is not too pleasant
it’s worth putting up with the weird scent

perricone could do something about the smell
i looked all over my bathroom to find that smell!
the smell is very slight

if you are sensitive to smells
the only thing is the smell.
i can't even smell it ---
that’s why i use even though it smells bad
some people cannot tolerate the smell
which like i said smells to me like dead fish
the complaint about the smell
doesn't care if you smell like a dead fish
the only downfall is the smell.
this product really does smell bad.
