not worth the money.
the problem is the price tag.
considering the price of this product
definitely not worth the money
it's way over priced
so for the cost at 1
not to mention the price tag!
i can't justify the price
how anyone is buying this
i can't imagine paying that pricetag
just not worth it
for $95, this was not worth it.
not sure if i will repurchase haven't decided.
it's definitely not worth the $69 price
waste of product i'll pass on purchasing again
to be honest i wouldn't repurchase
the price is steep
that price tag is just not worth is though
definitely not worth me paying $70.00 for it.
the price is ridiculous for the results
also for the price you run out quick
that was my main reason for purchasing
wouldn't repurchase for the results i get
i don't think i will repurchase for the price
will not be buying this.
overall i liked it but not worth the cost.
i won't be repurchasing this
i don't think i will be purchasing again once this runs out
not worth the price.
but in my opinion it is not worth the money.
for the price point
for this price, i expected more.
this product was not worth the price.
i won't be repurchasing.
i wouldn't repurchase this.

i actually bought this
would not purchase again
packaging i decided to buy this

my local sephora doesn't sell

i won't be buying again.
despite the price i was excited to try this!
n my opinion for the price you are paying the product is not my fav
this is the first expensive ageing product that i reluctantly purchased
that alone isnt worth the price tag
won't be purchasing this again
don't know if i'll repurchase unless i begin to see some significant results
for the price i expected more
i will not be buying this product again.
not thrilled about the price
which i believe was discontinued tp make room for this new formula

not worth the extra money.
i would not purchase again
definitely won't be buying it again
i won't be repurchasing.
really wish they sold refills of the patches.
very disappointing for the price.
i might reconsider repurchasing if they give the product packing a major overhaul
the price is also high
wasting all that money
i would like a refund!
perhaps if it was a more expensive moisturizer it be worth the 100 pts
i will absolutely continue to buy the josie maran milk
not worth it in my opinion.
probably won't purchase again.
overall, i would not buy this again.
would buy that in endless supply

i paid alot for a premium product
for that much money
i just can't see spending 38 dollars on this.

fix the smell and lower the price!
not something that worths it's price
buy at your own caution.
not purchase this as the price is ridiculous for what it is
not sure i can justify buying again.
first off this is a great value
a lot of product for the price
i will not be repurchasing again.
this serum is not worth the price.
not worth the price
the amount you get for the price
i wouldn't purchase it at the full price amount.
i do feel it is about $10 over priced.
don't think i'll repurchase unless they rethink the applicator
if you spend about twice as much as the price point of this tiny product
for the price point
i would have purchased
it's way over priced for how much product is given
until i saw the price
cheap oils that you can pick up from almost any grocery store
this would have been a solid four star rating if it hadn't been for the price
overall i would never purchase this
the price is steep
you get a lot for the price
not worth my money at all !
i am just not sold on it.
i think they are worth the money
i returned it because it wasn't worth the money for me

this is just a waste of money.
for me, it just isn’t worth it.
this is a waste of money if you actually pay for it
/or as a bonus gift
i would never buy this.
not a product i would invest in in the future
i just can't justify spending even $20 on this item
there are better options in that price range
it's not worth the extra step
would not recommend or purchase
i wouldn't repurchase this in all honesty.
not worth the money
it's just 1 more thing to repurchase
worth a try, but i will not be repurchasing.
i will not be purchasing again
for the price point i don't feel it was really worth it

i decided to see if sephora had a reasonable option
i will not be buying from this line ever again unless b
i wouldn't buy again
i'll try something else before i would repurchase this

at the high price i would assume that there are some expensive
i expected so much more for a creme at this price point

it may be worth it
i would never have paid full price for this oil.
bought this thinking it would help
will not be purchasing this again.
giving it 3 out of 5 because of price

this product is a bust for me
it is not that cheap
never purchase it again
i will use it all because of the price

read all reviews before purchasing this
definitely not worth the price.
i won't be repurchasing
i won't be purchasing.

will not be purchasing this product again.
it's the only item that i will consider repurchasing

the price is quite high

after reading all of the reviews i decided to purchase- despite the high price point
after much thought i decided for the price there are cheaper
not sure i would purchase again when the bottle runs out
i won't be paying the steep price for this anymore
all in all for this price
i used it all but i won't repurchase.
for this amount of money
i could have purchased a better product out of my local box store for a fraction of the price
not worth $42 at all.
i will not be repurchasing
i think this will be one of the last products i buy solely based off "bigger" yt'ers raving about it
this falls onto the long list of total fails that i've purchased based off bigger yt'ers recommendation

was expecting really great product for the price
in every price range

i expected more for the price
the price isn't all that great either

the packaging sold me on this.
i like this but would not purchase again.

for less than the price of this guy

especially for the $62.00 price tag.
i will not be purchasing this product again
not worth the price in my opinion
for the price tag
definitely not worth the price tag
particularly for the price
this is a total waste of money.

not worth the high price in my opinion.
that i can deal with
for the price totally not worth it

at the $50 cad price range that makes it like $12 per mask which is quite steep
decided to buy a new one
i won't buy this one again
i just recently re purchased
will not be re purchasing after i finish this tube
that's a hefty price to pay for something a 7
can't find one that seems worth the money
also will not be purchasing this again
definitely not worth the price
would definitely recommend getting a sample before you buy it
as for now i don't find it worth the purchase at all
for the price of this, it's not worth it.
probably not enough to repurchase
was pretty disappointed for the price
worth a splurge if you can afford it
i won’t be purchasing this
i would save your money on this one
worth the money in the respect
it would be worth.
before purchasing go into the store
it might be worth the price
but, i don't know that it is worth the cost.
however after seeing the price
i decided not to buy it
i liked it but not enough to purchase.
will not be repurchasing
the reviews are what made me purchase this product
expensive for the results i saw
not worth the price
the sephora employee agreed it wasn't worth it especially at that price
not worth the price point
not really worth the price
for the price, i expected better results.
at the price point
i don't think this is worth 108$ dollars.
probably won't buy again.
i think it doesn't worth the price
i will not re-purchase
not even close to worth the price.
not worth the money
will not buy again.
on since the spring 2017 vib sale
will not be repurchasing
since the product is average it's not worth the inconvenience
i would repurchase because it is pleasant to use
will not be repurchasing
i don't think i will repurchase it
i think if it was cheaper i may have repurchased
because of the price i will not
the price is ridiculous
won't repurchase if i find something better for the value
for the price tag it carries it does not deliver.
i wouldn't not purchase again.
the ingredients are what sold me
for the price point
the price is amazing
first off it's so small for the price
like it enough to buy again
i will not be repurchasing it.
will not be buying again.
i just bought this and had really high hopes.
i will not repurchase...
should feel more luxurious for the price.
ill use it up, but won't buy it again.
i don't think it lives up to the price tag with the quantity offered
if you do purchase this be cautious
overall, the product isn't worth buying.
i would say spending your money on other it products
at this price it's definitely going back.
there are better options at the drugstore for 1/3 of the price
it's not worth buying
not worth the money.
i wouldn't buy again.
will not be buying this again
save your almost $50 and purchase something else.
definitely not worth the money
i would not recommend this product based on price
overall i will not be repurchasing this product by will use it up
it was not worth the money i spent on it!
bought this when sephora had it in as one of their new products

bought this after using the cremadin cream
sensitive skin people give it a trial for a good week before buying
i spent lots of money on it
i definitely won't repurchase
at the moment i wouldn't recommend or repurchase it
i read all the reviews for this product before buying this
will not be buying it again
i would i buy again
definitely not worth the price!
nothing noteworthy or worth spending the money.
i do not see myself repurchasing it
purchased this product because i have rosacia
definitely not worth the price tag.
for the price i expected better.
which should be an option
needless to say i'll never be purchasing this.
if i could give it a negative rating, i would.
i definitely will not purchase.
i will not be likely to repurchase this
as stated by another purchaser of this product
i would not repurchase
before you buy this
would not purchase again
will continue to use because i spent the money
i tried once when i first purchased
researched a lot before buying because the price is very expensive
i definitely won't be purchasing this.
that said, i won't be repurchasing.
will not be repurchasing.
plus the price point is a bit much for me!
but i won't be purchasing because of the smell.
not worth the money in my option
when i pay that much
the product needs to be worth it
is too expensive and not worth it.
well worth paying the little extra
i should have repurchased the line release under eye repair cream
bought two packages to give it a chance
for the price i hoped for some improvement
bought this because i really make an effort to buy "clean" products without toxic ingredients
the product is okay but not worth the money.
won't buy it again due to the stickiness
won't be buying again.
sold on the double clean concept now.
and nothing worth the price being asked for it.
i saw that it was sold by sephora
i would suggest purchasing a different product
wouldn't go out and purchase or recommend
won't be re-buying this
do not plan to repurchase
overall i wouldn't buy this
i'd buy other products from this br
i will definitely repurchase!
i don't plan on purchasing this mask
the in store demo sold me
i won't be repurchasing
i will not be buying this again.
t wasn't worth the price
i spent a lot of money on this
for the price i was expecting results.
for the price point
wouldn't buy it again
i will return this.
i read reviews before buying it
it's not worth the money
it's not worth the price
so glad i didn't actually pay full price for it
would say it isn't worth the price
this would be a good bet
would i ever recommend someone to purchase this.
wish was half the price
i do not plan to purchase in the future
at the price point
i don't think that i will purchase it as the price point is a bit high
i don't think i'll be purchasing this product.
no, this is one i will not purchase again.
i would not purchase based on the results i saw with what product was provided
wouldn't purchase the whole thing
if it were inexpensive or you have expendable income then yeah buy it for general moisture
i probably will not purchase this with my own money
i would not purchase it myself
would never pay full price for this
especially for the price
for the price i expected much better.
it was also very expensive.
not worth it for me.
i definitely would say it is not worth it for the price
for the hefty price of $95 i would expect to see semi-immediate results
definitely not worth the price.
i would not pay the price for this product
would not bond to face
not for me, especially for this price!
i will not be buying again
will not be purchasing again.
wouldn't buy the charcoal again
for the cheap price
i wouldn't pay more than $8 for this product
for the price i guess this product is okay
for the price it's at
tons of other cleansers out there that's worth investing money in
won't be purchasing again
i can get higher end cleansers for the same price per ounce
i will not be repurchasing
i feel like i can find something similar for a cheaper price
for the steep price tag i expected spectacular results
no where close to justifying the steep price tag
not drastic enough to justify the price
i will not repurchase it.
will i repurchase this?
overpriced for the results delivered.
for the price that i paid i expected it to be a lot better
not terrible but won't be repurchasing.
and for the price point?
i can't afford $50 every month and a half.
for the price point its not worth it for me
if this was cheaper or if sephora made their own version i would buy it for sure
i would definitely buy
just a bad product to be priced at 70 dollars
i would be happy if i spent 20-35 dollars for this
needless to say i regret this $70 purchase.
not worth it in my opinion.
the cost did not justify a repurchase
which cost a 1/4 of the price
the small amount for the price ruin it for me
so this is a pricy purchase for me
not worth the money
won't be buying this again
many of which are at a lower price point
i just don't love it enough to repurchase it
i will continue to buy
will not purchase again.
this by far is one of the most disappointing products i've ever purchased at sephora
purchasing something worth my money
after a sample it proved it was not worth purchasing
this makes it not worth the price to me.
i will say that for the steep price tag i would expect an amazing skin transformation
if the price was more reasonable i would definitely consider buying it
totally not worth the price tag at all
this oil to me is not worth the price at all
this oil is definitely overpriced
it is just has a much higher price tag!
it is just another oil and overpriced at that.
reserve is not worth it
overall i don't think this product is worth a purchase
it is about $20 cheaper than this product
wouldn't recommend purchasing it
so of course i had to buy it
this was not worth the expense
i won't be buying another one
not worth the price for me.
especially for the price
i'll use it up but i wouldn't repurchase.
will not be buying this again
i'll finish the bottle, but will not repurchase.
will not buy again
obviously for the splurge i will use it up
save your money on this one

not worth the price $$.
product allocation feels nice
bought this because of the good reviews
purchased two hoping that would be the last
it was out of stock
also there is very little product for the price.
to me it's not worth the price
not to be expected for that price
not worth the money in my eyes.
extremely disappointed considering the price of this product
i am not going to buy this again
i gave it a try but won't purchase again.
not sure if i will repurchase.
s that work just as well for 1/10 of the price of this

it's something that i would likely purchase on my own
i kind of bought this on a whim
i probably won't repurchase
however, it's not worth the price.
i wouldn't re-purchase
i don't think i will be repurchasing after
at best i'll buy it as an extra once a month.
i waited so long for this product to be back in stock

not the product for this price
i wouldn't buy this especially for how much it cost
nothing special for the pricetag really
i would not repurchase
not worth the money at all!
i regret buying it
i can purchase something different

i would recommend just buying a cheaper alternative
buy the sale thing for much cheaper
i'll never buy it again
it is very expensive
bought this oil because of all the hype.
you are strictly paying for the gold
don't buy into this
i feel that this product is not worth its price

so when sephora had the sale i got this
one can diy this at home at a fraction of the price
will not be purchasing this again!

it's just not worth the $75 i paid for it
not sure if it's worth the price
we both purchased the item.
please do research before purchasing any products with your hard earned money- this just won't cut it
the price is absurd.
definitely not worth the price tag.

definitely not worth the price!!
for the price you pay it's not worth it.
i probably won't repurchase this one because of the scent

i would not purchase it again
i can't believe sephora would sell a product like this

one good thing is that its more reasonably priced than other br

now seeing that it is over $100 to buy
not worth the hefty price tag in my opinion.
gave it 3 stars because of the price

i decided to return it for a refund
i do not recommend at at price tag of $100

for the cost it's not exactly an economical purchase
but i can't find where to buy it online.
i got this free w/ $25 purchase here on sephora.
i can see someone paying that price for a luxury br
shocked that the price is that high

it is half the cost

i went to sephora with the intention of purchasing another product from another line
still am wiling to pay more money for good anti-aging products
at this price point

beware: you're buying less than ten dollars worth of ingredients- well under five for the company
this is even cheaper
i did not find the benefit of the product is worth the price
spend the money in hopes that it would help
spending almost 200 on this?
i can't believe they are still selling this product for this much money
don't feel i will purchase again
which you can obtain for a fraction of the cost somewhere else
i even bought the algenist oil, nothing.
i feel for you guys who paid the high price
it is overpriced for what you get.

very little product for the price
i wouldn't re-purchase
am not tempted to repurchase
i did not like the product i had higher expectations considering it's price
i'll finish my jar but i won't be buying more.
i would definitely buy again despite the scent if it was not priced as high as it is
before purchase i read the benefit
decent even with the price range its in
asking for a sample before splurging
might be willing to re-buy once i run out for winter
i didn't notice any results making it worth repurchasing for it's price
i am not sure i would repurchase however.
that i paid for
very pricey and did not impress me for the price.
it is a good amount given for the price i will say that
i will never purchase it again.
even though the price was way out of my budget
for the steep price tag
definitely not worth the super high price tag.
i eventually returned it because i think it is overpriced
wouldn't be worth it
money on this one
bought it, not happy, returned it.
which i will continue to buy
for this price point
i wouldn't make this investment
i will not re-purchase this.
definetly not worth the money!
the price itself is reason for pause.
not worth the price.
i will not buy it again due to the smell

once i'm done i will not repurchase
won't be buying this anymore.
i'll never buy it again

not worth the price in any way.
for the price i expected results

little high priced for what you get.
it smells bad enough that i would not repurchase.
i will not be buying it again
at almost half the price
i will definitely not repurchase.
this was a huge waste of money
for the price tag
don't recommend to buy this product.

for the price it should be a bit larger.
i would save your receipt if you buy this product
very expensive for the amount
would not buy again
probably a one time purchase for me.
not worth the money.
this product is way too small for the price
the problem is the price
it cost $35 in store
or at least a reasonable amount for the priceprice
wish there was more product for the price
i don't regret buying it
i recently bought this product after sephora stopped selling the skyn eye cream
i wish sephora would start selling the skyn eye cream
i will have to buy it from them
i like this company
in fact buy this
i not worth the extra step in my opinion
i will not buy it again.
didn't use up a lot of cash
will not be repurchasing
read the ingredients list before you buy this.
especially for that price
i splurged on this product during the vib sale along with some other items in this line
which is what you expect for the price
since it is very expensive
this is one that i will not be re-purchasing due to the very high price
i will not repurchase this mask
luxury products that expensive are worth it it because they really work
made this expensive purchase really believing that it would be a keeper
this was a purchase i regret most.
won't be re-purchasing
i can see this happening with a cheaper drug store br
or just buy a different one
in my opinion its overpriced
i won't be buying it again.
i will not repurchase
even though it costs $125
including one product that sephora doesn't sell that cost more than $200
at these prices i can't afford to use it all the time on a retired person's salary
the price is also somewhat off-putting
there are much better products out there that cost 1/4 the price of this one
the price is steep
it was a waste of money
i would not purchase this
i just think you can find better for a more affordable price
i expected it to work within 3 days honestly for the price tag
not worth the price at all.
there is no way that this product is worth the sticker price
forth about whether i wanted to spend so much money on a single skincare product for about 6 months before i actually bought this
decided to try it even though it was double the price
it's half the price
overall, not worth the money for me.
however, not worth the price.
for the price i would expect to see some benefit after the amount of time i used it
i would not purchase it because for the price
i expected a lot more for that price.
if you're going for price
you'd be better off buying something from the drug store
i wouldn't spend the money on it
a decent cleanser, but not worth the price.
still none are worth the price tags
it costs a whole lot more
i probably won't buy again
i won't repurchase unfortunately.
this was a waste of money
and for that price tag, no thank you.
i just can't justify the price for the amount you get
i would not have purchased this product on its own
doesn't seem worth the cost.
00 minimum purchase i was going to buy my usual philosophy help me with retinol in it
i will not be repurchasing this product.
i will likely not repurchase since its a steep price tag for just a primer
sales person sold it to me as a spot treatment.
would not buy this again.
this was a total waste of money
the product did not last very long for the price
probably wouldn't buy again
save your money on this one.
i can find better products for a cheaper price
for the price i expected more.
for the amount of money
at twice the price
i won't be repurchasing.
not worth it though
so why pay more?
your paying for a name on this one.
i used it all won't repurchase
for the price it is fair quality
even at the cheap price i will not be purchasing again
i don't think i'll be buying this again.
don't think i'll purchase this again.
i don't plan on buying until then
will not be repurchasing.
not worth the price.
it just a waste of money and time
will not repurchase, & am returning it tomorrow.
overall not worth the money
i will say that for the price
it's a huge bottle with tons of product so value is there
there are way better purchases that can be made for half the price
once i run out i will not be purchasing again.
i this doesn't live up to its price
i would not buy this again.
i definitely won't be buying it again.
i would still purchase again
this product is certainly not worth the price
expected more from the price point
but its definetely not worth 40$.
wouldn't buy it again.
i tried this product instead because my usual moisturizer i buy was out of stock
i probably won't buy again.
for the price its not buying me the extra time that it should to justify it
not worth the money.
particularly for the price
will not purchase again.
this was extreamily disappointing because this was an expensive item for a student to purchase
this was not cheap
for eh price i expected better results
i'll use it until it's gone ad not purchase it again
you think you are receiving for the high price
he should seriously consider dropping the price to a more affordable $80
not enough to be worth $120
can't believe the price for this.
definitely not worth the price for only 1
i will not repurchase.
i definitely won't be repurchasing
don't think i'll be repurchasing
because of that i will not be repurchasing

overall.....not worth the $39 i paid.
t's not a total waste of money
i won't be buying this again
i won't be buying it again
would not purchase again.
i definitely won't be repurchasing
i just don't think this is even close to worth the cost
not a terrible oil, but not worth the price.
one of the sales at sephora recommended me this

i will finish the whole bottle since it is pricey
i will not repurchase
i will not buy this product again.
i will not be buying this product again.

i will not be buying this again
i won't buy again
i just don't think this is worth the price.
not worth the price tag for it ending in breakouts
since the price is prohibitive for many (most?)
good, but for the price, i won't repurchase.
i do not see why it costs more money than average moisturizer
i feel like it is just a poor value for the price
haven't noticed any results that make it seem worth the price tag
i will say to people when trying this product to grab a sample before buying
i won't buy again
it was sold out during the vib sale
for the price i was expecting lot more.
i will not be buying it again.
would not purchase again or recommend to anyone.
this was the first ptr product i've purchased.
despite the 80-something-dollar price tag

maybe if it were cheaper i could actually buy it
not worth the money or time in my opinion.
i will be returning this item

then wasting expensive products
very disappointed in this product, for the cost.
would never buy again
because of the lack of results i will not purchase it again
not really worth the price
i won't be purchasing this product in the future
a very expensive purchase with absolutelyno results at all
i will not recommend this to my friends who have combo or oily skin nor repurchase in the future
will not be repurchasing

i won't buy again
would have to replace it monthly
i do not think i will repurchase

not worth the time nor money
at this price point
i won't be purchasing it again
the price is too high for what you get.
i can't really justify the price though.
i wouldn't say this is worth the price for the amount you get
if it was cheaper, maybe.
i sure won't be spending $80 cad on the full size
while the results were ok i wouldn't purchase for $69
not waste the money
please save your money this products are not worth it
especially with this price i expect more.
i will not repurchase again
you can purchase that online for 5 bucks
but not enough to make it worth the price.
i would much rather invest in a good eye cream.

will purchase it again
however at this price
will not purchase this product again.

for the price tag i would not use it again
i will not be purchasing again
i won't buy it again
thought i would splurge
with such a high ticket price

i will not be buying it again.
is it worth $72, though?
would not purchase again.
i decided to buy this product
i will not repurchase this item
a decent price for what it claims to do
for something that price i expect at least be hydrating enough

i assumed it would be worth it
i will finish because expensive
a ridiculous price for a worthless product.
definitely wouldn't buy this
didn't feel it was worth the large cost
i will not repurchase this product
this moisturizer does nothing to warrant the expensive price tag
which is pricey for what it is
that doesn't justify the super high price tag to me
i just cannot justify the price of this product
i won't be paying for this price for this mask
if you are considering purchasing it
for those who is thinking to purchase this product
for the price- i expected much more

my only issue is the amount for the price.
price - overpriced for what it is offering
at that price point
i wouldn't spend that much money on it just for that
for the price it's definitely not worth it
this is the first eye cream i've purchased
did not pay a cent for it
for the price tag it's def not worth it.
was swayed to purchase this product at more than double/triple the cost
don't mind the price tag
i can't really justify the $85 price tag
with the price of this stuff
for the price, i expected more.
i just bought this
i won't buy this again until it comes in a pump
not worth the money in my opinion
i would repurchase this next winter
i won't be purchasing.
the price is way out of line for the amount of product that is actually in the bottle
will not be repurchasing
will not be repurchasing
the breakouts are not worth it
honestly not in the way i expected considering the price
in my opinion not worth the money !
not worth the price
its not worth the hype
would not purchase again
won't purchase again unfortunately
i don't see evidence of increased value for the price
i decided to invest in this cream.
for the price i expected and hoped for more.
i will never buy it again.
that is just unacceptable for a product at this price
with that price tag?
not worth the money
will not repurchase again.
not luxurious at all for the price
still not great for the price
deducted one star for price
for some reason sephora priced it a bit higher than shseido website
this product was a total waste of money for me
got this since it has more product for the price
i don't know if i'll repurchase it
i will not repurchase this item.
honestly not a product worth repurchasing
try before you buy with this product.
will not buy this one again
for the price i was disappointed
i do regret buying this
definitely not worth it at all.
it's so small for the price it is definitely not worth it
the amount of product is a pittance
get far more value for the money
it's not worth the money
it was a waste of money!
the price point was so high
i actually returned it considering the price.
overall was not worth the money
it is so expensive
the amount you get for the price is ridiculous.
do not invest in this product
it is not worth the high cost
i will not repurchase
but this won't be a re-buy for me.
this should cost $30 tops.
i will spend whatever on a great product
i will likely not be repurchasing.
with all my ren purchases
you do not get your money's worth if it has to be repurchased that often
not if i have to repurchase that frequently
i knew it was something i wouldn't buy again for the price
i will not buy this again
for the price, the cream is a better bet.
i would not purchase this product again.
i decided to splurge after reading all the good reviews
along with the price
will never repurchase it again.
for what you get in terms of value
this product costs way too much money for mediocre results
the reviews made me want to buy this
at this point i don't see myself repurchasing
probably not worth the price.
for the price, i expected more.
i would probably repurchase for the spf.
i am happy with the purchase
i don't think i'll repurchase because i am not dealing with digging product out of the cap every day
not worth the money.
i'll use up the rest of this, but i won't rebuy.
not worth the price
i would say buy a cheaper eye product with better packaging
i will not be buying this ever again.
so depending it may be worth the splurge
if it weren't for the quick expiration
don't even look at the price tag
it wasn't even available for purchase
it totally does not worth this price
i'd rather buy less product
it is simply not worth the money
then consider the price
so not worth the cost .
i repurchased several times.
i will be refunding
repurchasing the balm instead
i would not repurchase or recommend.
buy something that works
i think when you purchase a mask
you get a lot of product for the price
i don't think i will be repurchasing
for the price i paid, it's a total let down
for it's price, i would expect a lot more.
despite the high price decided to try this
would never purchase anything from this br
a little goes a long way so its worth the price.
for now i'm going to shelf this
you do get a huge amount of product for the price
not worth the money.
i guess i expected a more luxurious experience for the price
try before you buy :)
will not be repurchasing
i won't re purchase it
this was an impulse purchase that i really regret
definitely not worth the money
this was another one of those bought-in-the-excitement-of-just-having-had-a-makeover-purchases
i immediately purchased it.
i would not have purchased this product
i should have read the ingredient list before buying this
beware before you buy it!
i will not be purchasing.
purchased another eye cream for half the price with amazing results
especially for the price
it's not worth the price tag.
i am sure there's better products out there with more affordable price
i sadly can not recommend this high priced cream even if you wanted to splurge
i don't think i'll be repurchasing.
for the price point i don't see a reason to repurchase this eye gel
i will definitely not be buying this eye cream!
however i will not buy this product
returned and won't buy again.
i wouldn't buy this product again
i wouldn't repurchase it
i feel that this isn't really worth the price
when i splurged on this purchase
not worth the money.
frankly for the price
i would not repurchase or recommend this product
especially not for the price
50 bucks for that item
these are not worth the money
i regret spending my money on it cause it wasn't worth it
waste of money would not repurchase...
the price makes me reluctant to buy it again
was not worth spending the amount of money i did for only one treatment
because of the cost i would maybe purchase this again
definitely not worth the price tag
not something i would recommendfor the price
would never buy again
i wouldn't repurchase it since it wasn't completely effective
i will buy again just for the strips .
you can buy off br
sephora will give refund on products that don't work for you
so invest in a better product.
it did a much better job for a fraction of the price
the cost is way way too much to buy this on a regular basis
given the high price point
buy their store br
overall so not worth the money
there are better options price-wise
except have a ridiculous price tag
please sell them separately!
i'd hesitate unless they upped the amount in the package or lowered the cost
if you could buy the night cream separately i would most definitely purchase it
the expensive price tag
please sell them separately.
no way can i justify buying the combo

i will probably buy this again.
it was worth a try
i don't think i would purchase a full bottle.
it is a waste of money
over all not worth the cost
however i expected something for such a high price tag product
the price is ridiculous
for buyers who are more gullible
the higher price is further deception that it is expensive because it works
of all the products i've bought in my time
happened to be in the market for a new face wash
i won't be purchasing it again
disappointed even with the sale it's still pricey what i got
it is not worth the risk.

this product is way overpriced for what it does it didn't live to the expectations
i won't be repurchasing again
way over priced too.
but for what it is it's not worth the price.
the salesperson at sephora really sold me on this oil

its not worth the price tag

i would have given a three rating
so to sum up, not worth the money.
this was not worth the money.
ntriguing i just had to try a sample to see if it was worth the price tag

i will return this product.
i started trading one product of the line
hefty price point because i was impress with all the great reviews
after reading all rave reviews decided to get this at vib sale
i don't think i'll be buying de products.
even at the hefty price
decided this is just a big waste of money
won't be purchasing again.
bought this expensive br
i am disappointed for the price point
will not be buying again.
will never buy this brand again!
the experience was worth it
i will not be purchasing this again due to the scent
i don't think i'll be buying this product again
i won't be repurchasing when i run out

i won't re buy
for me the results is worth the price
i just bought this product yesterday.
won't repurchase just because i can spend less on an eye cream with the state my skin is in

i will continue to use it, but i wint repurchase.
will not be purchasing again.
i won't be purchasing this again.
this was a huge waste of money.
don't buy this product.
that i would have to pay for shipping for a product that made my problem worse
the very few times i had a issue with a product i was refunded for the product without having to send it back or pay for shipping an opened bottle back
won't repurchase this one
i would not repurchase this again.
i don't mind buying
it makes me question whether i should invest this much money in any other skin care products when there are much cheaper options at drug stores
i definitely would not buy this again.
i paid so much money on it
next time i think i'll opt for another product
i would not purchase this again.
i will never buy from this company again

the only down-site to that is the price.
i will not buy it again.
won't recommend or buy again.
if it was good it would be worth it
decided to splurge on this in hopes it would work based on the good reviews

not worth the money.
in my opinion it is just not worth the price
wont repurchase this anymore
i will be returning this to the store.
i paid a lot for it
not worth the price that doesn't remove my make up
not worth the price tag
definitely not worth the price in my opinion
not worth the price in my opinion
haven't decided if i will buy it again
especially when that price tag
if i were to use this as a daily cleanser i would probably have to repurchase at the very least once a month
i gave this product 3 stars because of the price
i would buy this product again
given how expensive this product is
i wouldn't buy this this regularly
especially for the price
i won't be repurchasing again.
wouldn't purchase due to price.
bought this as a splurge.
so not worth the money.

especially knowing the price i paid for it
so i quickly purchased this.
i will save my money next time
nothing special given the price.
the price is just too high
now, the price is just crazy expensive.
hope someone buys it for you xd
