how it makes my skin look
it makes my make up looking flawless however
no matter how good it looks under my make up
a very small amount goes a long way
this one is not a good choice for me in winter as it is lightweight
before it dawned on me that a really intense moisturizer was what i needed to make my foundation smooth
great-under-make-up
great as an under-eye cream as well.
t works perfectly for me
i can say with confidence that this product is amazing

nothing has worked as well as this product
it helped so much!

this is the only one that truly works
expensive but a little goes a long way.
it lasts a very long time because you need so little
seriously the most amazing product ever!
works great for me.
but it really works!!
looks like it so,far.
this is a great product
though most of my face is in great shape
well worth the splurge as my eyes look as good as the rest of my skin
i am always skeptical when a product says it helps with dark circles
had an amazing added benefit for my dark circles
), and this really lifts and takes care of it.
my eye area looks great
for all the good it does
a little goes a long way...
best part is that i feel it lasts all day!
it works for me

every little ounce of it works works works like magic
but this is a miracle.
1/2 pump is all it takes.
