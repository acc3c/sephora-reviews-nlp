when the woman at sephora recommended it for my acne prone skin i was skeptical

i can use it three times a week with no redness or irritation
my skin is getting different issues- rosacea
we often don't need a prescription retinol treatment
i don't have problems with wrinkles yet

you tried pretty much all kinds of acne treatments/routine
i also find that this product helps to clear up minor blemishes
hormonal acne in my 30s
i listened to dermatological advice
my breakouts weren't severe enough to warrant a prescription retinol cream
my skin has recently become much more blotchy
redness and age spots have diminished.
it's not a dermatologist strength product
retinol product that totally wrecked my skin
my acne has never been better.
it's even healing up my acne!
i compared it to a friends retinoid which burned
have read so much about the redness
looking to prevent signs of aging
etc until i worked through the redness
i probably get 2 pimples a month now
i still have my wrinkles/fine lines

have a lot of scarring on my cheeks
the discoloration in certain spots is less noticeable
i love this product especially pared with the clinic acne system
i apply it at night to treat discoloration
because i read that retinol creams were excellent acne fighters
my mild acne has cleared up
scars have become lighter
this helps a lot to prevent breakouts
one of those steps is adding retinol to my skin care
redness or breaking out

jawline along with scarring

trips to the dermatologist to get cortisone shots to get rid of pimples were guaranteed every single week
i also tried it as a spot treatment for some blemishes
have combination skin with a slightly oily t-zone which has always been congested with blackheads
the size of my cystic acne
i've tried numerous of masks to control acne
just experienced the worst hormonal acne breakout after going on the pill

only as a spot treatment on certain pimples
i only developed acne prone skin in my mid-twenties
when i get my pimples
i've tried a lot of a lot of acne spot treatments offered by sephora
did absolutely nothing for my cystic pimples
a girl recommended the mask instead as exfoliators can spread the bacteria on acne prone skin
i plan on using it as a mask once a week to help prevent the acne
then as a spot treatment if i do still get cystic acne
or acne prone skin i'd would highly recommend this mask
also helped with my mild milia!!
this mask is a great mask for acne
i would even recommend it to people with acne

my acne has become a lot better

cystic acne at that
this has already helped to reduce some inflammation
it began minimizing blackheads after one use
whiteheads are gone 95% gone
from first use i noticed it brought any acne to the surface

causing breakouts or affecting makeup
someone like myself that suffers w/psoriasis
i've read mixed reviews about acne
miraculously it doesn't cause breakouts
i normally breakout with one irritating zit once a month
there was no monthly zit to be found
does not irritate my condition
it was for anti wrinkles
i can't say that it will erase wrinkles
help with my acne
i too need facial moisturizers without the anti-aging tag
my skin was unbalanced from using acne creams
also very expensive dermatologist products
am prone to redness/dryness
not to mention early wrinkles!
i also noticed less flaking after using a retin-a derivitive
it hasn't caused any clogged pores or breakouts
i find it doesn't strip my skin or cause redness
now my chest has hyperpigmentation
very good for sunburn
painfulness of my skin has been solved
my skin is very prone to acne
i am prone to eczema
something about it even seems to soothe breakouts
since using this product i still get typical hormonal breakouts in the usual spots
i still have breakouts
this is the first wash i have ever tried that made the acne less painful
blotchy for several minutes
my skin is super rediculously sensitive now after taking an acne medication for a few months

the whole cleansing line from boscia is great for acne prone skin
it does not combat all of my blemishes
i don't suffer from acne
i do suffer from severe breakouts mostly on my forehead triggered by certain foods i eat
my breakouts used to take weeks to get rid of
like many facial products have
this product is great for acne prone skin
it hasn't completely gotten rid of my acne
the redness is diminished
never causes any breakouts
it's even better then the murad one for acne.
cleared up my few acne patches
i won't say it keeps my face 100% clear as i am prone to stress related acne
with acne-prone combination skin
for some reason my acne scars did not fade when i was using this
i've had no issues with this clogging pores or causing any acne
her acne was 40% better after 1 day use
keeps minor breakouts at bay
it keeps my skin clear with no acne
i get dermatitis around one side of my nose
clear of acne in just a few days
i don't necessarily have acne
i struggle from hormonal acne

my pimples disappear the next day
i notice my old acne scars are fading
something common among people with deeper pigmentation
perfect for combination skin with hormonal adult acne
redness has reduced significantly
i didn't even know reducing my redness was possible for me
i don't have terrible acne
really really bad hormonal acne at that
it clears up my blemishes/pimples over night
gentle enough that my eczema doesn't flare up
i don't know how it would work for someone who has acne or acne prone skin or with different skin type
this is the only cleanser i have found that causes no irritation
it hasn't caused any flaking so the dryness from this cleanser is very manageable with a quick coat of moisturizer afterwards
if i have breakouts
you either get pimples or dry patches
i recommend this product if you have a few pimples
i don't have heavy acne but some around.
it does actually heal my breakouts
then apply this spot treatment to said zit
you'll notice the redness is visibly reduced.
i start to get itchy skin
the itchiness is gone
has never caused breakouts for me
it definitely takes a few applications to fully treat a pimple
get deep pimples around my chin
it clears up any pimples or zits overnight
some other products i've used cause the pimple to worsen before it improves
controls acne very well
doesn't dry out the skin around the pimple
my pimples are still under control
or reduce the pimple
it really helps with the inflammation by the next day
i am 41 which means i've tried a lot of different acne topicals in my day
now i'm dealing with some changing hormonal issues
i'd say if your acne isn't severe
/or have some hormonal acne
i just got this in when i got a huge zit in my hair line
in one day the zit was gone!!
the next day the redness was gone!!
before any pimple would actually appear
it works on body acne as well.
i don't have widespread acne
in the past year i've started to get some adult acne
this stuff gets rid of pimples almost overnight

it does help to get rid of my "acne"
painful pimples from time to time
the pimple never caused my face redness
it has completely avoided me 4 embarrassing pimples
my face is constantly red from irritation of acne
since then i´ve used it on pimples on myself
pimples have dramatically reduced in size
i rarely get breakouts
seriously after 2-3 days the zits are noticeably reduced
when i get stress acne it is usually large
it helps my acne heal faster
i rarely get breakouts
the next morning there was no soreness or redness
i switched back to using burt's bees acne spot treatment
it doesn't minimize zits or heal zits faster
it doesn't reduce redness even
helps the actual pimples to feel calmer
i like this product it helped with my breakouts
it doesn't damage my skin
my skin was reddening
the zit never even surfaced
now i use it at the first sign of a pimple
have pretty much eliminated my acne problem entirely
which helps prevent breakouts
peeling like a lot of spot treatments do to my skin
twice-daily application over the course of a few days prevents occasional deep hormonal blemishes from fully emerging
because the blemishes are never allowed to become whiteheads
the risk of scarring is greatly decreased
the acne cleared up much faster

this really helped my current blemishes
i started seeing a decease in redness almost overnight
i used it really for breakouts
cause even more irritation
i've struggled with acne for years
i just get a few pimples on my chin at certain times of the month
this helps the breakouts a lot
i get fewer pimples
minimizes redness during the day
cures the acne gently
i find that if i see one of those pesky cysts beginning to form under my skin
if the cyst is already there it slightly lessens the redness
if i have a pimple that isn't cystic
a few of my pimples were gone
product to help soothe redness
as it's harder to "zap" bigger/more developed zits
like many other acne spot-treatments
it is by far the most gentle acne treatment i have ever used
it will zap a zit overnight
it's so gentle that i have no worries of overuse as with other harsh acid treatments
i like this product for when i first get a blemish/ redness/ irritation
i felt a pimple coming on under my skin
my pimple didnt get any bigger

this treatment definitely tackles the puffiness
the boscia eye treatment doesn't
eye treatments are so expensive
it doesn't help for my puffiness from bad allergies
there are pricier eye creams that can help with puffiness
many products irritate my skin
amazingly, the dryness is gone.
i saw an instant decrease in puffiness after applying
my monolid eyes are prone to puffiness

my skin tends to develop blemishes around the nose
avoid certain foods to block rosacea flare ups
it really helps with redness around my nose
way better than cliniques redness therapy line
which tends to cause breakouts
i get alot of facial redness.
as a person who is allergic to all sorts of facial products
i struggled to find sensitive skin products that helped with both the redness
there is another product out there in commercials for acne
ive always had problems with face cleansers irritating my skin
i've used it in combination with the murad redness treatment gel

i've suspected that the redness in my face has been due to rosacea for some time now
the redness slowly got worse over time
there's a lot less redness in my cheeks
the only con is that murad doesn't have a set for the redness therapy collection
a great cleanser for redness, nonetheless.

feel of my redness-prone skin
the redness lotion also works great.

while i still get zits
hormonal acne for 2 years
my acne has cleared up
now i just need to get rid of my scars.

so i have adult acne, and it was turning cystic.
it's made by dermatologist audrey kunin
my blemishes are few
my cystic acne peaced out
i would recommend for anyone with adult acne
my skin has never been clearer in 5 years struggling with deep cystic acne
old cysts that i thought were long gone
had a horrible case of adult acne earlier this year
i feel like i've tried every single acne product both cheap
most importantly no more cysts
my breakouts are less frequent
this cleanser is exactly what i needed for my acne prone skin
i can say that my acne has cleared up

cystic acne on my cheeks in my early 20's

painful acne all over my chin
i went to dermatologist after dermatologist
i noticed a major reduction in blackheads on my nose
humiliating breakouts every month on my chin
i get bad hormonal breakouts so when i do i use this product i don't use it daily because i don't breakout in acne a lot i just get zits on my chin

making the acne even worse
i would definitely recommend this to someone who has a sudden breakout of adult acne

find that using no other acne treatments or medicated cleansers will prevent any irritation
everyone with severe acne
especially hormonal should try this
irritated the acne or too gentle
this actually got rid of acne without being harsh or overdrying

i'd only get maximum of one pimple a month
this totally works against hormonal/stress acne.

before trying the product my skin had a lot of discoloration
my acne dark spots have minimized
it gave me tiny whiteheads on my cheeks
don't put it on fresh pimples
it hasn't gotten rid of all my acne scars
this has been my go-to treatment for any discoloration i get after a nasty breakout
no pimples no hyper pigmentation, nothing.
had an awful allergic reaction resulting in cystic acne
the acne healed except for a the little occasional bumps i would get around the time of my period
needed to find something to clear the acne scarring i had all over my face
i saw my acne scars lighten almost immediately

blemishes from acne breakouts

my scars were so bad that i had injections.
after the scar treatment i was told the red marks are spots not scars
it's not the fastest acne scar lightener
it has cleared/faded my skin from the most stubborn acne marks that i've had for years
i only put this product on my scars
these scars are more recent
now i finally want to fade all my acne scars
after taking accutane for my cystic acne
dark post-acne marks
it's helped with other scars i've had none acne related i absoloutly love it
.and i still have occasional breakouts.
it's like it treats my zits
going from clear skin to uncontrollable adult acne can be rather frustrating

scarring from adult acne
not just for acne
for pigment discolorations, this was awesome.
including budding acne which is great
have purchased many new products to get my acne
i am no longer getting many new pimples
i now needed a product to tackle these red acne scars
the lady that does my facials actually suggested that i use this product because i have a lot of post acne spots on my chin from hormonal breakouts
my forehead seems to do that too most serums though
i am hispanic so my acne scars consisted of purple
all of the products that i have been prescribed from the dermatologist have only caused me to break out more/dry my skin out
those breakouts were diminishing
it's doing a great job on lightening my post-acne marks
any time i get a pimple
i've never had serious acne
i find that this post-acne gel works better than clinique's dark spot correcter
the murad acne system has really been clearing up my skin
now that redness has gone down way far
everyone thought was still acne
my face is completely clear of redness from scarring
i find it also helps active acne spots from getting too red
i'll admit i was a little hesitant at first to try this product because of the controversies over hydroquinone
acne in my late 30's was just horrifying.
even more horrifying was the resulting hyperpigmentation
i carefully applied murad post-acne spot lightening gel only on the dark spots
get rid of almost all scarring on my back
afterwards my skin was riddled with painful hormonal cystic acne
i knew the only affordable treatments i could afford would combat the discoloration

i also recommend the redness solutions face wash
when i started as a clinique consultant i was put on the redness solutions line for my rocesa
the moisturizer have helped my redness majorly
i definitely recommend this to any one with rosacea
it works better than other creams marketed to rosacea sufferers
not drying or harsh as some products that seem to be better for younger skins plagued by acne

i've tried a lot of redness reducing moisturizers
i don't think that any cream can cure redness
i can't see any difference on my redness-prone skin
note that it does not completely diminish my light rosacea in the morning
i don't really think it reduces redness all that much
so much that foundation hardly covers the redness
i find it's the only way to keep my redness under control
can't say much for effectively reducing redness
i like this cream but i still have redness.
i decided to try redness solutions.

continues to struggle with acne
i do not have acne
cannot really comment on anti-acne effects
this mask helped clear up acne
i think it really helps prevent acne
even making the cystic acne feel instantly better
my zits have dried up completely
i've had some recently painful breakouts from doing facials
it made my old breakouts
my acne has began clearing as well.
then i put extra on the pimples
there is still hyper pigmentation
this mask helps control my breakouts.
the redness in my face is gone
it did absolutely nothing for my acne
decided to stay in the clinique acne solutions line
i also noticed that it tends to shrink some of pimples after each use
do break out occasionally due to hormone
it also helps reduce the redness of the pimples
has a very oily t-zone that is prone to blackheads
so only use if you have oily skin or problem zits
some old acne scars are starting to disappear
also good for acne spot treatments.
it's cleared up some of the acne that i always get at my chin
noticed some difference in the acne
most of the time i have mild to somewhat moderate breakouts
after i put this on it calms the redness
a must have for acne-prone skin!
this is the first mask i've used that helped to clear my skin without rash or irritation
definitely consider using the acne clearing line
after 2 uses it stopped my acne
it still prevented new acne
for the acne i already had on my face
while it would prevent new acne
my old acne would clear away
use different acne solutions
i hope this technique will prevent my acne from getting used to any one product

i like the fact that it is made to prevent acne

under eye smile wrinkles :
i don't think anything in skincare can eliminate wrinkles
this completely removes all puffiness
