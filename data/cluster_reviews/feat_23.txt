this is quite possibly magic in a bottle.
i've literally never seen such fast results.
have never been happier with any product
my makeup lasts longer throughout the day
it's a little more than i like to spend
a little goes a long way
packaging make it hard to squeeze the last bit out of there
has a more even color
a little goes a long way
i don't care how much it costs.
i am 33 now and starting to see more fine lines.
even with nice lotions i need something more now
but that's just too much.
just too expensive for it!
jart cicapair cream for less than half the price
so far i really like it
i couldn't be happier with these products
try a little on my irritated patches of skin… i put a little bit on each side of my face
remember a little goes a long way
so far this is the only product that helps significantly calm bad flare-ups
it's actually gotten more soft
i love it so much
if used consistently it does tone down alot
may be a little too heavy during the day
a little goes a long way
i actually had less sleep last night than i normally do
my skin actually looks healthier
i will give it 4 since it is quite expensive
maybe even just to use it every other day
make it stretch- little bit goes a long way
a little goes a long way
even better, no bonus breakouts!!
a little goes a long way.
i don't think i've found a moisturizer i like more than this
i can see it being justified because you really only need less than a dab
i like it a lot.. but the price is too steep.
i think that so far it works good
my skin felt soft the next day as i used it overnight my redness looked much better
could have probably easily gotten 3
i wish it was a little more affordable
i loved it so much
even my boyfriend noticed how much more clear
this cream might be too much for you
too bad about the price!
it does seem a little bit goes a long way
i only use very little does a long way.
i only wished they would make bigger jar.
i no longer have burning
it's a little too rich for the rest of my face
they went away much faster
a little does go a long way
a little goes a long way!
started getting little bumps all over my face
a little goes a long way
the only thing better than how it feels is how clear
though it has made my skin a little more oily than usual
a little goes a long way
it may be a little pricey
the product does have a pump on top that you need to use very little as it does go a long way
it is a bit on the pricey side however
it will last longer than one would think
it is pricey, but a little goes a very long way.
and it is a lot cheaper than la mer's face oil.
a little drop goes a long way
i'll also try more of tatcha's products as well.
it's softer than ever
my foundation goes on so smoothly in the morning too
i would highly recommend splurging on this oil as a little goes a long way
more so as we are approaching the colder months
how much face oil are you really going to be using at a time
i promise you're getting more than what you pay for
rather than on my fingers first
a few drops is really more than enough.
every other oil i have tried is either too heavy
i feel any type of skin can benefit from this as it can either provide some much needed hydration to very dry skin
it will last a very long time as a little goes a long way
it's easier to spread onto my skin without losing much if any at all
it gives my foundation that little bit of extra moisture
i try to savor this beauty as much as possible.
felt better since using tatcha
le is pretty short
how it has made a difference
on the side where i am applying this product i no longer have my texture bumps
i know brightening is going to take a lot longer
a little goes a long way
my dark circles have gotten better.
i notice that my skin is much more even
my skin has not brightened even a little bit
so much so that several products i tried stung my skin
i don't see how i'd get more than 10 applications out of that jar
i always get a slightly burning sensation
your skin actually looks younger
that just seems a little too extra to me
i feel as my skin is more smoother
after a few uses my skin definitely has better texture
i do not thing it is firming enough for extra mature skin
because there's a ton of cheaper alternatives that will do the same thing
not so sure it improved my face all that much
it felt tighter and looked fresher.
not so much that it irritates my skin
i'd guess the full jar has about 8-9 uses which makes it slightly more expensive
it's much better to take off
had to put quite a bit on
t would be easier to peel at the end
it is a little pricey
that said a lot in itself
this product has more of a cool appearance than what it does
but it actually makes your skin better as well.
did feel a little more firm
as far as i know
i did a more natural look this day
my skin looked just a wee bit smoother.
it does take longer than most masks.
box because i've heard so much about it
i never really expect masks to do much other than make me feel like i wasted money
maybe with more use?
it cost quite a bit
you also have to use so much
it has enough for about 3 masks.
i'll definitely be trying more glamglow products
it doesn't last for more than a day
doesn't last for very long
my whole face felt much tighter and more firm.
he said that his face felt so much firmer after we took it off
more importantly it actually works
i love this so much!
not so much since i started using this product
i've noticed my skin looks much better
a little bit goes a very long way
the texture was not better
my skin is much more smoother
my face looks all-around much much better
although i am in the market for a product just like this that is maybe more reasonably priced
a little goes a long way.
it seems to work well!
i couldn't believe how much the swelling went down
a little goes a long way!
my skin was better
i went to sephora for a little help.
but...better than snake eyes!
my skin looks so much better!
my skin is complicated to say the least.
that just means it does its job well :
loved it so much
after using this all winter i have definitely had fewer issues with flaky skin on my face
my skin looks better than ever.
a little goes a long way
and so far this is working very well.
at first i thought it was a little pricey for the amount you get
t will last longer than i anticipated
so gel works even better.i only use at night.
bags under my eyes better than anything else
my skin is worse this winter than the last 3 combined
i wish it did more for the claim of "youthful-looking skin"
it seems to go pretty far
some people might want more moisture
this is my favourite so far
my skin is a lot smoother
i would have liked it to work a little faster
this bar has helped so much.
i wish it were a little less expensive
a little goes a long way
i love it so much i'll have to buy more as soon as i run out
would like for it to be bigger.
my skin has dramatically improved so much that i no longer feel like i need to apply beauty oils in the morning
works so well, lasts a long time too.
my makeup applies much better with the smoother surface of my skin
this skins in a lot faster than the clinique
a little goes a long way with this
so far so good
"a little goes a long way" for my normal
only problem is now i am starting to wonder if i am just playing it safe while there are even better products out there
despite my "grass might be greener on the other side" mentality
it kind of stays wet for a little bit
people have commented on how much healthier my skin looks after using it for maybe a week
no more tight feeling on the cheeks.
it takes off makeup so well
i couldn't love this more!
i love this soap so much.
now i use it for my body as well
this has help me so much i have only been using it for 3 weeks
as it is easier
my face look more young
don't exercise as much
that makes you look younger
a little bit goes a long way
you can cover a pretty large area with just a little bit
my skin is aging faster than i'd like
it did not spread as far as many treatment products
bottle size i know i'd get fewer uses than i'd hope
or just more age than they'd like to show
why does it have to be so expensive.
surprisingly it's lasted me this long
maybe it doesn't work well on mature skin
i never put much stock in products like this
skin felt firmer after just a few uses
felt like i needed something "more"
i feared too many products cause break outs
a little goes a loooong way.
i no longer look like a zombie.
i look so much more energized
personally i found a little goes a long way
only tiny complaint...a little goes a long way!
after i put it on i look so much more awake
have noticed that a little goes a long way
buy the product because i loved it so so much
it gets better over time
i love this product so much
there was more than a little puffiness
so using an eye cream makes it worse.
i feel like my under eye concealer lasts much longer throughout the day since i started using this cream
you don't get that much product in the package
this cream helps so much in the mornings before we apply makeup
it got so much better
my eyes look so much better
this product also has to be played around with on yourself before figuring out how much to use
this does a better job than any other high end eye cream i've tried
s are even a little bit wet it is actually impossible to open this tube
it brightens, depuffs, and so much more.
you can always get deluxe samples of it which is even better
but i like this one better.
it just seems to brighten just a bit more.
it also sinks in quicker than fab
even more so than it's more expensive counterpart
a little goes a long way as well.
i need less of it than i did before i started using pep start
as far as the product it does help with brightening the under eye area
i saw some say the ball is a tad bit hard for our tender under eye area
the little extra that may come out isn't a waist as take that
i do recommend using this product for the reasons above however it is a tad sticky not much
such i no longer wear make up
i travel a lot for my job which affects how much sleep i can get some nights
feels much difference under my eyes
looser skin around eye
this has helped so much
a little goes a long way
now that my skin is in much better condition
but i like this one more.
a little goes a long way.
also, a little goes a long way.
just a little dab is enough as it spreads very easily
i’ve never had better skin in my life.
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way.
love it so much!!!!!!!!
i think it might help the product last longer too
less than some of the other products i've tried
there's one more eye cream that's slightly less expense
i did notice a little goes a long way, though.
this glides on so much smoother
i like that it has more spf than the other
what i love most about this murad day cream is that a small amount goes a long long way
a little bit goes long way
there is a lot still in there
it does everything that it promises and more!
so far so good.
as this can be a little heavy
it is a little pricey
you only need to use a little at a time
it just makes it better in this case
although this cream has spf 30 it is not even a little heavy
noticeably more balanced when i wear makeup
the scent could be better
you pay a little more for murad
first time user and so far so good.
my skin has never looked better.
a little goes a long way.
a little goes a long way
so far i really like how it goes on my skin-not too oily
i like their products so far
second, it goes on quite smoothly.
it has spf in it so that takes care of that
my skin looks a lot better
this one so far is just as great
it is a little heavier than the daytime
in the morning i have a little greasy feeling
so far so good.
i will see after a couple of more weeks if it improves my skin texture
i like very much this cream
so even though the “perfecting night cream" was a good cream
i am planning to stick with the “essential-c” since it works better with my oily
how many of the wrinkles i was starting to see have gone
a little goes a long way
my skin looks fine so far
no better no worse
my skin looks so much better
as the recommended 5 was far too much product
i've never had a product actually work this well
don't see this lasting long
i wish the pads stayed on a bit better
i love it so much
like so many products
makeup looks so much smoother
better around my eyes
the ones from when i get too little sleep
i noticed that if i move around too much
a little goes a long way
just a more tired look in general
it just made me look so much more awake
i've spent more on eye creams that didn't make nearly as much of a difference
i never expect much from skin care items
the effect is still going strong
after the first application my eyes look so much tighter
i can't wait to see how much better it gets over time
if it never gets better than this i will still be in heaven
a little goes a long way
little goes a long way
and a little goes a long way.
this made me feel so much better
also, a little goes a long way.
even though it is a bit pricy
as far as my skin goes.
i do notice that my face possibly looks "thinner" as i age
i might feel differently as i age more
works but if used too often it breaks out
this is probably the first anti-aging product i've ever used that has pretty much done what it claimed
that the longer you use the product the more of a real change there will be
all i have to say is it works better than cliniques repairwear uplifting
honestly i saw faster results with this product than clinque's
even though i had no makeup on
a bunch of small ones that stuck out to me so much because i would always notice them
my skin all around just looks smoother
my makeup goes on so much better
definitely will use this more.
it does last a good long while
are they noticeably better?
i just look younger now when i look in the mirror
i still have plenty
a little goes a long way
it truly is better than needles
my face seem to be more plump
my skin has never felt better!
they have saved me so much time and money.
i will defently buy more as it does what it says.
it looks more plump / less defined as before.
i know it says lower half of face
i love this mask so much!
are making them "less deep
then i get a little more
i still have a lot left
i look even younger than 20 now.
i couldn't possibly be happier.
gets gone very quick
my face looked more plump
it make my skin really smooth that my make up look so much better after i use this
hopefully it will last me a little bit longer since its pretty pricey
this is quite a bit of money compared to other products
when you think about how much you get
how well it works
because i know its normally more hype than results
initially it feels a bit greasy
it feels light and a little goes a long way.
it is a little pricy
don't see much effects other than that
even though it does have a slight film it does mostly absorb into my face fairly quickly
i find myself worrying about texture more during this time of year
if i could give it more than 5 stars i would!
have to switch to something lighter during the summer
still feel the price is a bit high
a little truly does go a long way
or make the oil even worse
i may have used too much the first night
it was a little better
some days i wish it was a little heavier
you don't need very much
i couldn't be happier with it
i agree with most of the reviews on here thus far
if i grab more than dime size amount its too much
and my skin is just tighter, more youthful.
you will be tempted to use too much
if you get too much out
a little goes a very long way
as much as i like it
did find it to be a bit pricey.
it's improved it a little.
a little goes a long way.
after using the trial packets i can say very little is needed
my skin no longer has flaky areas
because i have tried so many br
i just use a bit less in the daytime
plus it takes very little product
and it works much better for me.
the dark circles are now less dark!
a little goes a very long way.
am still on the search for something that costs a little less
it looks a lot smoother
this little miracle has wkd for fine lines
so far it is amazing.
how many times have you squeezed out too much?
i needed something will a bit more oomph to it
i love this product so much!
so my skyn looks better than when i was 20-30.
really this product has changed my skin for the better
my skin looks better now than it did when i was 30
i wake up looking better than with make up!
the product is not as much as i think it should be
the best part is that i used a lot less make up
this mask gets better as you wear it
it is much better than more expensive products.
the only reason i gave it 4 out of 5 stars is because my dry sensitive skin could still use a bit richer of a formula
once you learn how much to use
how much of a difference could it make?
i just put a little on
so worth the $47 price tag bc a little bit goes a very long way
so that is pretty much all the time
my makeup sits better on my face now
i'll be using this tube for a pretty long while
this is more of a scrub than a mask
brighter more even toned skin
a little goes a long way.
a little goes a long way!
my pores are so much smaller now
a little bit goes a long way
opted for something a little more affordable
this actually rivals my glamglow mask
this is sooo much better.
you only need a thin layer so this will last a very long time
my skin is smoother, brighter, and more even.
i feel like some tricky acne dark spots i've been trying to get rid of are already fading
i could see that my face feels so much smoother
the tube is going to last forever because a little goes a long way so that's a plus
it has helped my skin so much
i no longer have breakouts
which is much worse
a little goes a long way
so far so good
it's just a little too harsh for me
mine looks so much healthier when i use this.
i just wish it was cheaper.
the first week i broke our a little more than usual
a little goes a loooong way
a little goes a long way
sometimes it's too much
a little goes a long way
the price was a little intimidating
they are much less severe
really like it so far
i like how this product works well with my clarisonic as well
but it has helped so much!
my skin tone is so much more even
there will be plenty more
my skin is better than ever
little goes a long way.
much love for these products!
this stuff makes the exfolikate that much better
it is a little pricey
because you use so little product
lathers very well so this will last a very long time
not only does a little go a long way
it also lasts a pretty long time
my complexion is much brighter
the brightening effect makes me look so much younger
as far as brightening the skin this does give such results
my face is clearer than it's ever been
a little bit of this product goes a long way- it removes my makeup
i find myself reaching for this in the shower more than any other cleanser i have
my skin has never been better
as it is a little on the spendy side
my skin has been so much better since incorporating this into my routine
it foams up just enough but not too much.
it ended up doing a lot more than addressing just that
this cleanser has done more for my face than anything ever has
my skin has never felt smoother
only a little bit is needed.
you can leave it on longer to get more exfoliation
so the product lasts for a long time too which is nice
never in my life have i ever spent so much money on my face wash
better than the exfolikate intensive or whatever it is called
maybe even helped a little with my pores
not as much as i thought it would
my blackheads are better looking than ever
i get far less outbreaks
the formula is pretty thick so you only need a bit
crazy enough more brighter
t lasts a very long time too
my skin looks better
after a few more uses my skin became clearer
gentle enough for everyday although i probably will only use a few times a week
a little goes a long way
i love how a little goes a long way
after using for about a week or so my face just looks a lot better
however, i like the glamglow a little bit better.
so far i am really liking this.
so far so good.
so far i haven't had any problems with this
i probably used less moisturizer than i usually do
a little goes a long way
one of the better cleansers out there
a little does go a very long way so this bottle will last you a long time
hope to see more results as i use it more.
a little goes a long way
i couldn't be happier with this purchase!
actually better than it was
i did find it a little harsher than boscia's
a little bit goes a long way with this stuff
you only have to use a little bit to suds your whole face
i love this cleanser so much.
love the moor mask so much
a little bit goes a long way
so far it is my #1 cleanser!!!!
hoping to see improvement there too
i wish there were more pads
i too had a tough time in the beginning with the rollerball
the roller worked a little better
is still hard to get the product out at times
not as deep as they were
see even more results
how well it works on fine lines
plumper skin with no breakouts so far from using a new cream
a little bit goes a long way.
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way
so far so good
hope the results keep getting better
that won't be for a while because a little bit goes a long way
watch how much you use though
a little goes a long way.
what it desperately needed
a little really does go a long way
though a little goes a long way with this product
the only downside is that it is a tad bit expensive
a little bit goes a very long way
i love this face butter so much!
my skin appears more even toned
this helps a lot and has little to no smell!
my skin has never looked better
what's even better is i don't have to use a lot of product
i may be a little bias since i've adored pretty much every josie maran product i've ever used
it's a tad on the heavier side
i couldn't be happier with my purchase.
if i use too much in an area it will cause a break out
feel i got a better value than buying this alone
a little definitely goes a long with this product
even though it is pretty pricy
a little bit goes a long way!
as this might be too heavy for you
all my lines are plumped and my tone is so even.
i always come back for more.
if it pills, you are using too much!
so far this has been working for me through spring
this is by far
just wish it came in an even bigger size.
a little goes a long way
this made my skin feel so much better!
if you put too much it will take longer for it to absorb into the skin
i wonder if it is because i am applying too much product?
after using it for a while i find that a little goes a long way
if i put too much on it feels greasy
my make up applies so much easier
i can honestly say my skin is much healthier.
a little bit goes a long way
as i have noticed i now use less foundation
am careful not to put on too much or else naturally my face will get too oily
i like very much
my complexion looked more even
i imagine i will see even more of an improvement with time
a little goes a long way.
you might need a bit more oomph than this one delivers
ter was so much plumper
the deeper in love i fall
i love this moisturizer so much!
it will work for you too
only a little bit goes a long way
in less than a week i can see
is so much softer without texture
a little goes a long way for me
it helps keep my skin so much brighter
this actually has been helping so much that my acne is significantly reduced
my oils are much less prominent than before using this product
my skintone is definitely more even
i spend a lot of money on my skin
it has most certainly paid off
there are better options
the price is much better
it kind of heats up a little bit on the skin
i am much more fair skinned with fine lines
my skin does feel much softer
not too many to be rough
i think it is better than another br
costing half again as much
a little goes a long way when used as directed
my skin is immediately more even
leaving it quite smooth
much like the rest of the products in the truth line
then when they had it as a 100 point reward i got like 3 more that is how much i love it
this one is much longer lasting
gentle enough to use more than once a week.
be giving it as gifts too
i can see how much cleaner my face is).
it has these little beads in it
it lasts for very long time.
this is a good mask to go before other masks as well
couldn't recommend this product more!
it gives my skin that much more brightness than it had before
it did leave me quite red for a little while
find a little goes a long way
i will say it is more of a scrub than a face mask
although i find it more of a scrub than a mask
this has helped me so much.
a little goes a long way
love this scrub so much!!
i will say that i use it more as a scrub than a mask
didnt think much of it until i actually used it
i don't have much issue with my skin
a little goes a long way
maybe a little bit too dry
i couldn't be happier
a little goes a long way.
a little goes a long way
it foams slightly and a little goes a long way.
like this better than all the "recommended products"
even though it makes no claims about doing that
only downside is it's a little pricey
a little goes a long way
a little drop goes a long way.
i would like it to be more of a scrub.
this one seems to do the same job removing makeup without being too harsh
a little goes a long way, and it foams up nicely.
my face has never looked better
definitley did notice my skin looked a little brighter
found they were too harsh
cleaner than anything else
think could take off more make up than it does
my face changed remarkably worse in just a couple of days
a little goes a really long way so added value
a little goes a long way
its more than i would usually spend
i can tell that a little goes a long way
also, a little goes a long way.
a little goes a long way.
this has helped both issues so much
considerably different after just one use
so far i haven't had any issues with this mask
the older ones looked more calm
i liked it so much i went out
it really helped with my bigger pimples
there are other charcoal masks that work just as well that are cheaper
kind of noticed a more even skin tone as well
so far so good
my skin has never looked better
looked so much cleaner
today my skin is softer feeling than it has been in months
couldn't be happier with it
not too much for my sensitivities
my skin tone looks more even.
this one was so smooth
my face looks so much better after using it.
i love the fact that it is easier to wash off
the price is much better
a little goes a long way
this is beyond better definitely doing the switch
how well this product goes on
i love it so much
looks good so far
a little goes a long way.
so i decided to try this because it was cheaper.
little bumps under the skin
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way
t lasts for quite a long time
she said they would work even better after using the mask
definitely will buy more!
i actually loved this mask so much
my pores have gotten so smaller
i can tell a little will go a long way with this.
though it seems a little pricey at first
skin at the next day feels a lot less greasy
found that works better for me
most importantly the way my skin feels when i wash it off
better than any glamglow by farr.
i actually leave it a bit longer on my skin than what is recommended on the directions
throughout the day my skin wasn't producing so much oil
the smell might be a little intense
this one just looks better
the best part is that i've noticed my skin looking better even after i take it off
my lines seem to be getting less intense
my skin just seems brighter
it really should be less than half of that cost though
it's way too expensive for the type of product it is
it does have a lingering scent in it that's a little bit stronger than i want it to be
however the smell may be too strong
my skin is softer and more even.
those are definitely harder to target
my skin is sooo much better!
i would pay a good $10-$15 more for this easily
over happily because i love my skin so much now
especially after wasting much time
a little goes a long way
my skin did feel a little firmer
had faster results with those
the fact that a little went a long way
as far as the scent
however it gets better
when i wake up the texture of my skin is much more even
i love the way it makes my lines smoother
i just look a little better without makeup than i have in a long time
my skin appears more fresh and smoother all over.
i actually stopped wearing foundation because my skin looks better without it now
it just looks so much healthier
i not longer feel the need for foundation
a little goes a long way, and i love this!!
i could not be happier
my skin is so much smoother
it might effect the skin differently for each time zone because of humidity changes
already have noticed that i don't tend to break out any more
i like this so far
i love this product however i do feel it is too pricey for the benefits
there is better stuff on the market for that price
the tone was a lot more even in about a week
my foundation looks better
it looks much brighter
my complexion is more even
my make up looks better
i've also found that makeup now applies much smoother
stays on my skin much better throughout the day
it is much smoother
a little goes a long way
a little more brighter i will buy this again
my skin looks a lot brighter
it had been looking quite dull this winter
i liked it so much that i also bought the oil obsessed cleaner
just overall make it look a lot younger
in my opinion way better
it is light enough
actually a better deal than pretty much every other serum i've looked at because you get more than an ounce
it is more like a gel than an actual cream
my skin looks so much healthier
i got this originally as a 100-point perk without thinking much of it
just uneven overall so naturally i would gravitate to a product that is supposed to help against that
my pores seem smaller too.
i will keep using this until i some how find an even better product
this is seriously the best i've tried so far.
i look a little more alive than before i tried it
so that proves to me it works better than the products i already am using
this transition has been great so far
i want to try a few more serums before i spend $50 or more on a fullsize bottle
my skin has never looked better!
even as far as texture goes
i love this product so much
my makeup applies better and last longer.
better every day of use
this serum lasts for a very long time as a little goes a long way
my makeup goes on better and lasts longer.
seems to absorb better than many of the competitors
it's cheaper in the long run to just pay the extra $8
i'll definitely be trying more
since i like it so much i suggest the bigger size it a really great product
glad a little goes a long way!
i put a little bit on my lips
a little bit around the sides of my nose
it's a little much for the face as it feels a little filmy
a little goes a long way
effects get better with use.
because it is so light
just started using this little miracle product
a little goes a long way
this helps me out so much
i like this even better than my josie maran argan oil
it's too thick this one feels better
you don't get too much product at once
i will still keep my others as well as this one.
but a little goes a loooong way!
my makeup has never looked better
a little goes a long way
my armpit feels so much softer and lighter.
this smells even better
works just as well
it was much better than what i was expecting
it gave my cuticles so much more life!
5oz is asking a bit much
it was the more expensive of that line
basically i'm back to my combination skin due to medication rather than nature
perhaps with oily skin who would benefit more from the face mist more than this oil
it has so many more uses.
hair tends to hold scent better than anything
i like it that much
it's a little on the pricier side
make me breakout so much
helps us to look better
easier than lots of other oils
works better than any other
it's so much more
the price is more than fair for something that seems to be lasting
i am not one to care too much about scent
could not be happier
my skin is getting noticeably softer the longer i use it
no matter how much i hydrate
stick to the more traditional things that fit you better
it goes on so smooth
does not linger any longer than a few minutes
maybe wish it was a little thinner to fit under the eyes better
this works even better
i loved this product so much!
i love it so much
it makes my eyes look like i got more than five hours of sleep
makes it look less tired
it lasts a surprisingly long time for the consistency of the stick
has help so so much
i just look brighter in the morning
was hoping this would be different than the blur stick
it seemed to work well as a primer under my foundation as well
the stick has so much product
feels even better after you've been out in the heat for awhile
really like it so far
it has honestly made my life so much easier
it works so well
(in a year because mine is still very much full)
makes my eyes look better in the morning
that will do a pretty much same job with this
this is just fancier :
i do feel like my skin is a little softer when i use it as well
it's lasted pretty much for 2 months
there is a lot of product
a little goes a long way
so far i love it
love this product so much.
thought i'd might as well try it out
use it on the mornings that i look more tired
if you want to make your skin look a lot more nicer
makes my under eye bags more normal
helps it last a little longer
always come back for more
it goes a long way
my skin tone is much more even
i can already tell this product will last me a long time because a little goes a very long way
i especially like the way it works with other products in my skin care routine rather than against them
a little goes a long way
i no longer have an oil slick on my face by lunchtime
more than anything though
never really had skin issues other than oily combination skin throughout the seasons
it has retinol which is why it works well to even out skin tone
while this may seem like a long period to wait
no matter how much i use
my skin likes it so much
not shiny" for far too long
it almost make my foundation last little longer
just because my skin feels so much better after i apply this stuff
it kept getting worse
finally in much frustration
actually cause more break outs
just a little bit of this goes a long way
this clearer left my skin feeling really clean
while i guess it will take longer
just wish it were cheaper
this is the only kind i have that works without fail for my slightly acne prone
tip: the bottle tends to cause a lot of product to come out at one time
i couldn't be happier with this product
maybe try some more things from murad
thought i could find something better
my skin was so angry everything made it worse
i definitely like the product so far
even more clear than it has been
could be a little better for shine
you only use a little bit at a time
expecting to find something better for my very oily skin
my skin finally started to look better
so much as a skin hydrator
i love this lotion so much i've been buying it in bulk
maybe after a little more use
i also swear i'm a tad more "glowy", too.
it would be too heavy for use during the day for me
i do notice my skin getting better
so far i really like it
it's working for me so far
too much to ask for!
i like this moisturizer so far
it does come out a little quick so close your eyes
other products could done a better job
it does more than water
sometimes i wished they were more effective
or have too much fragrance
skin moisturizer goes on even better
the real test will be during colder months
so far so good
my face was a bit less red.
it made the mask dry faster which made the mask pull anything out better
it makes the mask work so much better.
it made the mask sooo much better
i've spent my money on worse
i don't need to use as much product
expensive masks are going to last just a little bit longer
it only takes a couple spritzes so the bottle is going to last a very long time
it really does help your masks sink in deeper
my mask goes on so much smoother
i just wish it came with a little more product for the price
makes it a little hard to apply
as you have to have it far enough way to be effective as a mist
it does make masks go on smoother
when i use it with the fresh mask i felt like it helped it to absorb better
it went on so much more smoothly
this time around my skin felt different- in a better way
i love that i can also buy a bigger bottle for a little bit more
has been given more even skin tone
a little goes a long way
i think the scent is closer to its descriptors than most people realize
have had no more break outs
the only saving grace is that it isn't too heavy
my face no longer feels like an oil slick
a little product definitely goes a long way
they only irritated my skin more
i just have to be more careful when i take it into the shower with me
one pump goes a long way!!
it helps my skin so much
i love this so much
it foams up so much
at night made my face so much softer
well actually at all.
it requires such a small amount that a little goes a very long way
my skin has never felt better
it was so much better
the biggest difference i noticed was that it removed my tough eye makeup like mascara better than anything else i've tried
not a cream because those are just too heavy
i still have some left in the cute little bottle
a little goes a long way!
a little goes a long way.
i ended up loving this cleanser more than anything
a little pump goes a long way.
it is just so expensive
i love this product so much
all together these products leave my skin feeling fresher than ever
it takes very little for each wash
maybe with a little extra product it would do the job
but it works differently for everyone's skin.
it works so well!!
not much of a change in my skin.
there are certainly better cleansers out there
the product works great what more does one need
i've gone through 3 bottles of this so far
i've seen so much improvement in my skin.
this bottle lasts a really long time
i don't need quite this much moisture
part of one of tarte's "try the products" kind of little kit
my skin is better than ever
so many other oils would break me out
a price point $18 less than tatcha
too many chemicals for my liking
i think they changed their formula because i no longer liked the smell
my acne would get worse
better than any other removers i've tried
my skin has never looked better
they probably used too much
it helps me maintain my clearer-than-my-schedule-on-the-weekends-because-i-have-no-friends complexion
it's better than any other cleanser i have used with it
probably will need something a little more moisturizing as it gets colder though
a little goes a long way.
it still does its job
they have gone away faster
i am using less foundation because my skin tone is even now
keep working it into my skin adding a little more water as a go
my skin has never looked better.
a little goes a long way
i will definitely buy more!
my face hasn't felt any better!!
a little of this stuff goes a very long way
so far has been keeping my face calm
knock on wood it gets better as time goes on!
like it so far
a little goes a long way
$32 for one moisturizer is better than spending almost $50 for a bunch of different cheap ones that don't have the same effect
since using this i have had many comments about how soft my skin looks
a little goes a long way
my skin was already so much clearer
this actually soothed my skin rather than upset it
seriiously, too quick for the price.
after i have a little scoop
like so many women
which is two more jars than i've ever bought of anything else
just the right balance-- not too heavy
don't ever get rid of this little wonder bareminerals
any more than that
it smells better than the old formula
i tried a sample because i thought it maybe too much for my sensitive
a little goes a long way
my skin is definitely much softer
has made my makeup application look so much more smooth
that so many br
seeing as how it was getting cooler in so
my skin is more even toned.
my skin looks better since using this
for this several hours at home i decided to choose some less expensive stuff that is gentle
even though this only has spf 15 it still does a great job protecting me from the sun's rays
some of my dark sport is gone too
little goes a super long way
this has helped my skin so much while on accutane
my skin has never looked better
wish the bottle was larger as i go through this so quickly
a few days ago i thought about adding it into my foundation because i like a bit more of a runny/lighter foundation
so far so good.
a little bit goes a long way
just use a little of this oil
i love this product so much i've only been using it for a week
my skin looks more plump too.
love the results so far!
a little goes a long way.
with other oils i have tried it has made break outs worse
i love this oil so far
most likely because nothing has ever worked for me like this
i hope to report back with even more improvement
a little goes a long way
t is too much to wear during the day with makeup
most certainly more even
a little bit goes a long way
spent more money than i care to admit
changed my skin for the better
a little goes a long way
it is pricier but a little goes a long way!
this, i love so much!
a little goes a long way
can feel a little heavy
this oil is making it so much lighter
as far as the scent goes
its not too strong either.
realized i was using too much product
even though this is fast absorbing i prefer it for morning
i love how just a little goes a long way.
i do think my skin tone is more even overall
it was a little sweeter than i was expecting
you only need a little
my skin is so much brighter
wanted a little more out of it
less is more with this product..
it may seem a little pricey
t lasts a lot longer than some other products
i love this product so much!
have used significantly less moisturizer than usual
just better looking skin
so far it worked wonders
the actual bottle is even better!!
a little lasts a long time.
my face seemed more brighter
my face is smoother and much more brighter.
nothing works as well or as fast as this
because i know how much more amazing my skin is going to look with continued use
the packaging is maybe a little too sturdy
if you want faster brightening results
softer everything they claim i got
immediately upon first use i liked the way it absorbed into my skin + how much better my makeup looked
mother comments on how much brighter
overall healthy looking once more
that will likely be over a month since a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way
too much of the product broke me out.
this has not only improved the way my skin feels
my skin is so much softer
my face has improved quite a bit
it has made it look so much brighter
after doing a little bit of research i decided to splurge on it
after it absorbs a little bit
it's a bit pricey however i'm more than happy to purchase this again with continued results
i really like it so far
but honestly, i like this version even better!
wanted something a bit lighter for spring
it felt a little thick going on
however i was aware how much i need it
perhaps prolonged usage helps more than the one shot deal i got out of the sample
this has calmed my skin so much
a little really does go a long way.
it is slightly cheaper
so far this moisturizer only works with my skin.
it also makes my skin look brighter
so far i love it
i never imagined i would want to spend this much money on a product
it makes my skin even better
there is silicone in it which many primers also contain so maybe that has something to do with it
a little goes a long way
definitely use more product to cover my face than i would with my other moisturizer
i put this moisturizer on as much as i want
my skin has never looked more clear
everything i've ever used either breaks me out or dries my skin out even more
there is much less texture to my under eye since i've been using this
but a little goes a long way!!
it is so light
i think this product would be better for someone who has more normal-oily skin
i think it somewhat lives up to the hype.
but i find myself purchasing this more often.
alittle goes a long way
a little goes a very long way.
a little product goes a long way so perhaps they applied too much
a little of this goes along way
it goes so far for just a small dab.
love this moisturizer so much!
how much your face needs
i put a little bit of this on my face
it gives me a little extra love.
hydrates better than anything i've ever used
this seems to help a lot
they were doing a little
only reason i gave it 4 stars is because i think it should be a bigger jar for $40
a little goes a long way
my skin has never felt better.
then ordered the bigger one when i realized how much i loved it
a little goes a long long way
it is just so expensive
concoct this for much less
maybe $25 is a more reasonable price for what amount of moisturizer you're actually getting
i just ordered some more of this bad boy
my skin has never felt better
i've tried so many different moisturizers ever since i was 15
way cheaper than the high-ends
a little goes a long way
also a little goes a long way which i love!
a little goes a long way
it's made my skin look so much better
made my skin's appearance look so much better
love this product so much.
although it feels sticky for about 10 minutes afterwards that goes away so this is a pretty good moisturizer as long as you aren't in a rush
these clinique products i look much younger
it took a little bit of time to get use to the h
eye masks under the sun breaking my budget in the process because i thought if i got the really expensive stuff i would actually eliminate my problem faster
more so since i became quite ill
i love you so much
had so much baggage under my eyes i look 10 years younger now
the results have been getting better every day
love it so far
reduced under eye bags so much!
i switched back to the product because it is far superior
a little definitely goes a long way.
it isn't that much more expensive than the boscia cleansing oil
i did not see too much improvement with my breakouts
a little goes a long way.
i can get similar products for much cheaper.
so far it's lasting long too.
pimples are far fewer
taking my makeup off at the end of the day has never been easier
it also didn't do much for me in the way of reducing dryness or making my skin feel less dull
if anything is too heavy, it breaks me out.
i do wish the price point was a bit lower
this cleansing oil has helped so much.
looks brighter than it has in years
only a little is needed so it lasts a long time.
even though it is expensive
this product is much less irritating than coconut oil
it does a decent job of getting most of the makeup off
ve only used this one time so far
in just one use it changed my skin for the better
even areas a little raw
i feel like its even made my lashes longer
i couldn't be happier
my makeup goes on better
what people mean by "plumper looking skin"
my face not only feels better
my face feels more smooth
my skin is much softer
it's not nearly as strong as the oil
only giving 4/5 because i haven't seen too much improvement in removing my old acne
a little goes a long way with this cream!
quickly found out that if i used to much
the results were much better
a little more at nighttime
even though the price point is higher
my skin actually became smoother
it is a lot more firm around my eyes.
although it may seem a little expensive
as well as less fine lines
it's a little more expensive than face creams i usually use
you only need to use a little amount
my skin is a lot more even
i also like how there isn't really much of a smell to this cream compared to others that have a strong fragrance
i like it better when there's not much of a scent
this product is a little more than i would normally spend
a little bit goes a long way
it's now more glowy and smoother for sure!
there is quite a bit of product in the jar
this has helped my skin so much
it is a little too expensive for me to be able to afford to use regularly
this works much better than any of those i have tried
my face has already gotten more smooth
even felt more full/plump
could be a little too much for morning application on some skin types
is just a little too heavy for my skin type
way better than other br
even better my stubborn age
would be for it to absorb a little faster
you only have to use a little.
the complexion was so even
at first the cream seems as little too thick
to surprise it actually made it last longer
my skin texture is much more better
it's been on another level lately
notice that my skin tone is more even
it lasts quite a while
don't last any longer than other creams
my skin has gotten so much better in terms of radiance
it is much more intense
a lot also goes a long way.
as far as the claims
it is pricy, but this product goes a long way.
my skin felt more tight
mproved quite a bit while using this product
it also makes my make-up stay on longer.
i received this product from buzzagent to try having dark complexion at first i was a little skeptical if it wouldn't be effective on my skin tone
which gave me an all around smoother look
expect my skin tone to become even more even
a very little goes a long way!
it seems like my skin is getting better with each additional week
now i have normal skin with a little bit of acne scaring left
a little dime amount goes a long way
it only takes a little bit
so far so good
a little goes along way
as i mentioned before a little goes a long way
there are many pros from my trial use including: a little bit goes a long way
a little goes a long way.
t will keep it fresher longer
a little does go a long way
it is still quite an investment
they are better than a lot of them
only downfall is its quite pricey
thankfully i've been able to dodge the effects thus far
my eyes looked more "normal"
so far i like the tingle
a little pricey, but this sure delivers.
result: my whole face looks brighter
t could work better for others
much less puffy for hours after i used these
smooth, no lines, and much brighter!
my skin feels and looks much firmer!
so far so good
how many patches your getting
that's cheaper than most if not all eye patches.
the skin around my eyes is so much more firmer in the morning
eye cream work better as well
re-use them because there is so much serum in there
it makes me eyes look 100 times better
i like this product very much!
the reason why i give 4 is this eye mask seems not have too much serum in it
so this helps more product get onto each patch
sounds a bit much but it works.
i ended up leaving them on much longer than the recommended time
my under eye area was much smoother than usual
i've only used them 2x so far
wear way too much makeup
my under eye area felt so much tighter
you never need to worry about pumping too much product out
there is so much control within the pump
i find that i need less product than other eye creams which makes me feel better about the high price
admittedly i don't look for much in an eye cream
had a little too much hype
a little bit does go a long way though
didn't crease as much as it usually did throughout the day
how well it looks under eye makeup
it also makes my eye makeup look better.
this does the job well
just a drop goes a long way.
it dispenses way too much eye gel
it's annoying that i have to press it ever so slightly to get the amount i need
this one makes my makeup apply much more smooth
for me, it works better than the lancome.
it lasts longer than i expected.
don't look like death when i have had so little sleep
i still look a smidge tired
it's better than nothing
darker than ever before
wrinkles under my eyes making me look much older than i am
i even think my dark circles appear lighter
my dark circles seem lighter
it did make my under eye look smoother
started to notice more fine lines
a little goes a long way as well.
my dark circles are a little less dark
this is the only thing that made it better
so far i really like it
you only need a little works well for my dark circles
they look darker in the morning well
in about 5-10 minutes they look lighter
it goes on so smooth
so far i love this eye gel!
i can already see my eyes becoming not so puffy.
the gel is even better
a little goes a long way
so very much refreshing
i love this mask so much!!!!!
makes my face look generally more plump
i rarely spend time doing masks because i'm so busy
i always notice more plump skin
overall just helping my skin look so much better
i love it much better
the price is nicer
wow- my skin has never been better
feels better than ever
which are much more difficult to use
it spreads nicely over the skin so a little does go a long way
nearly 40 bucks is too much for a brightening effect
it does not take very much
no matter how much i use
i like how it stays in place thanks to the thicker consistency
i would prefer it being more subtle
how much this mask is priced at
this goes on so smooth
or even just a big break out
my complexion just seems so much brighter
i get the most compliments because it makes my skin look pore-less
the smell is a tad too strong so that's why i gave this 4 out of 5
this one is a bit lighter
as soon as i put it on the texture of my skin looked finer
it wears so well
it just gets it brighter
i've never really had the most even complexion
so even though my results aren't dramatic so far
i feel like i wasted a lot of money on other products hoping for the same results
my skin has never looked better
make my skin better
a little bit goes a long way.
after using for 2 days my skin feels better than ever
press halfway or you get too much out
how even my skin tone looks
it was not that much better than the clinique take the day off or even boscia makeup melter
however it was not as smooth as this product
love this product so much!
no matter how much time i spend on removing my makeup i always wake up with some still on my eyes
a little goes a long way.
it looks high end too
there is no better cleansing balm out there.
only need a little for your while face-
the best part is that a little goes a long way
so why am i spending 20$ more?
one does it for 20$ less
it takes a little work on eye makeup
this works so well!
it is pricey but a little goes a long way.
it is more like a night moiturizer.
let it sit for a little
a little goes a long way
i did not expect much more than a pleasant experience
this product makes that much easier to do
made my skin just look better without makeup
not too strong or long lasting
perhaps a littler brighter as well
i would perhaps use something different if my skin were drier
love this so much!
a little bit goes a long way- i am going to order the full size
much more advanced ingredients than other products
my skin looks better
also use a little less before my makeup
i'll be buying a lot more
it's like it actually gives more
so far so good.
a little goes a long ways
i feel like its best to use as a moisturizer for when youre staying home rather than wearing it under or mixed with makeup
it also has the extra little highlighter too
wears well under makeup too!
it is an easy way to add a little something extra to your face on those no makeup days
i wanted a little something more as i've been limiting the amount of foundation i wear on a day to day basis
it doesn’t work well when my face tends to become oily a lot
like a "my skin but better" look!
the "touch-on" highlight in the cap is pretty much useless
i loved it so much
it might be a little overpowering on its own.
since i don't wear much make up in the summer
my skin is so much better now after started using this product
i preferred it over my makeup rather than under
my skin is rather breakout prone
dewier look that has more coverage
i think of it more as an illuminating primer.
my makeup goes on a lot smoother with it
a little goes a long way
i think of it more as an illuminating primer.
it seemed to work well
this just fueled my addiction even more.
i just wish it was a little more pigmented.
the color was a little bit off for me
it took me longer than i'd like to admit to figure out how the cream in the cap was incorporated with the actual tube
i can use this in so many ways!
i don't wear too much make up at all
still don't have the best skin so this definitely aids in making it look as if there are no problem areas
it really does make my face look much more "youthful"
t adds just a little bit of color
will say that it stuck to my skin a little
it's best used under the skin rather than mixed into my foundation
other than that it was great.
a little goes a long way for both.
you only need to add a little
it goes a long way
so this product was a little dark for me
i didn't have to put as much foundation on top as usual
but it's way too expensive.
a little goes a long way
i learned not to use more than a dime size amount all over because the i would look like i threw glitter all over my face
a lot more subtle than i expected
i already have a highlight so haven't used the one included very much
only thing i don't like is the price is a little high
i love it so much!
it works so well
the highlighter is so concentrated than you only need a little bit
this method makes your highlight last longer because it has something to stick to
thought that it fared well as a primer
it did not make my makeup last longer than usual
i would recommend this for people who have foundations that may be a little bit too matte because this fixes that problem
i would avoid this because it does give you more shine
because that makes it work a bit better over powder foundation
i did not have any oil problems other than my typical struggles
a little goes a long way
this cream is a little too dark to use all over my face
the products work just as their supposed to if not better
i think that this highlight was slightly too dark for me
would be better suited for someone who is a bit tanner
my skin looks better, more youthful.
a little goes a long way.
it sits in my drawer more than i use it.
if you are light-medium to deeper you can probably get away to using this on it's own
actually doing more than just giving illumination
adding a little bit of this product to my face gives me an early summer glow
i could also see it lasting a very long time
a little bit goes along way
this one container goes a very long way
a little goes a very long way
'd be wary of how much you use at a time
i also like to add a little to my foundation to make my skin glow even more
might be a little much on whole face
i also notice that my skin is a lot smoother
i expected something thick that would sit on the skin for longer
or use a bit over my foundation
a little goes a long way
it is much harder to overdo this than it is with the skin perfectors
it is much harder
a little goes a long way
very little product is needed for an application.
my skin looks better than it has in literally years
it looks better than it ever has
my skin feels much cleaner using this.
have them use this too
it's never too early to start good skin habits!
now need a little extra help with fine lines
not so much on puffiness
my makeup goes on better.
plus a little goes a long way.
a tiny little bit is all you need
because it spreads quite a lot
they look brighter and not as tired all the time.
my first impression of this product was that it was smaller than i expected
a little of it goes a very long way
sample of it that lasted me about 3 months because you need very little
a little goes a long way.
a little goes a long way.
i seriously love this face cream so much!
i only needed a little bit to cover my entire face
i love this so much i needed to share
makes my makeup application that much smoother too leaving me with an all day matte finish
i love this moisturizer so much!!
it is more than i would pay for a moisturizer though
face were dried out more than usual
because of this i have decided to look around for a better
a little goes a long way
a bit too heavy for summer though
which is a bit too heavy for me
yet would not leave my skin feeling greasy had proved difficult to find
so far i'm liking it
make my skin so much better than before
this seem to be reducing that as well
no need to use a lot at all, and it lasts!
it's a little easier to work with
i quickly realized that a little goes a long way
my commute is kind of long
think it works well under that as well
a little goes a long way
this seems to even it out
although still does a little
great value- better than more expensive creams that i've tried
i just wanted another heavier moisturizer for dealing with winter
just a little bit of this product has lightened my dark circle
this stuff is truly amazing even compared to the more expensive under eye creams i've tried
a little goes a long way
as a while really deserves more attention
even though it is expensive
this product firmed them up so well that now i don't have any trouble at all
under my eye has more fat or something now because there isn't much of a hollow circle around my eyes
it helps it go on smoother
you only need a tad
i am 60 with very dry skin did not make lines worse actually made them better
maybe product needs to be used a little longer for results
a little goes a long way
keeps my skin from getting too shiny too quickly
a little goes a long way
i think it's too expensive for what it is.
this is especially good for summer when you might not need as much moisture
it does leave my skin feeling almost a little tight which is why i gave 4/5 stars
my skin has never looked better
i am loving it so far
i find it to be much more comfortable to layer two light moisturizers rather than using one heavy moisturizer
with this product my makeup seems to last longer with less shine by the afternoon
so far i love it
so far my skin is looking better than before
mix this with their oil skin never looked nicer
i look sooo much better
it’s hard enough to find a good “in between” product like this to pack on more hydration to the skin
the appearance of my skin is so much clearer
creams are far too heavy for my skin
although i need a cream too
my skin is getting better
my skin has started to balance too
it observes so quickly which is why i love it so much
the packaging is actually quite deceiving.
i found that i had to use more than just one pump to fully feel the hydration effect
more than one pump is needed to feel the full effects of the product
so although it is pricey
i love this product so much.
well this changed that
it has been great at making the texture more even
my skin is so much calmer this winter
this has made my skin so much better.
one must still use a heavier moisturizer should one want to live a happy
my skin feels a little tight
i will undoubtedly try more of their fare
- one pump is plenty for whole face
a little goes a long way
i can't even articulate how much this line has improved the texture of my skin
a little bit goes a long way.
my pores even appear to be getting smaller.
my skin looks so much better after using this hydration gel for a few weeks
given i am a little heavy h
for the price you'd expect it to do a bit more
i wish i would've tried this product sooner because i'm enjoying a much clearer
a little goes a long way too :)
still have plenty left
as well as generally better tone
throughout the day i get more
so far i am loving this
i just wish it had more benefits
i enjoy all the philosophy moisturizers so far.
softer than i could usually hope
even sometimes in the summer
i think some people may be using way too much if they are feeling greasy after use
a little bit will go a long way!
i think this has helped so much
i've only used once so far but it feels so good!
not to mention the container is slightly bigger than the original
after applying i feel like i could use more
a little goes a long way.
needless to say i have gone through a few different ones
i think it moisturizers a little better
it leave my skin smoother and brighter as well.
if you are first using this product i would probably leave it on for shorter as it does have a little tingle to it
it's a little expensive i feel
i found it to be too pricey
it does burn a little when i leave it on
the directions are a little vague which i hope they fix so that more people can experience it's glory
there seem to be very few i haven't tried
it was a little difficult to apply
my face was a little tight
the more i've used it the better it gets.
it can get a little messy
was a bit disappointed to find out that it doesn't foam up nearly as much as i thought it would
i would actually consider this much more as a face wash than a mask
this has definitely lived up to my expectations being that its relatively all natural
don't use too much
you only need to use a little
next, i use the ren, a little goes a long way.
a little goes a long way
it goes a long way
too much of this product
a half stars so far
it makes them look much smaller
i always struggled with dark circles
also, a little goes a long way!
a little goes a long way.
my skin tone is now even
a little goes a long way so a good bang for your buck
my face actually feels cleaner too
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way.
i don't like to apply with cotton because i feel to much is wasted
my face has never felt better
a little goes a long way.
it does come out very slowly at least
my normally dull skin is far brighter
i love it so much
so no problems with runniness
so far, so good.
the scents break me out even more
it's expensive but a little bit goes a long way.
for those who say that the scent is too strong
just wish it was cheaper.
i've tried so many things
i think i am even using a couple drops more than i need to be
a little goes a long way
my skin is much firmer
everyone is commenting how much younger my skin looks
feels better every time i use it
keep the little bottle
the feel is even more so
years from now too!
it does more for me than anything else in my regimen
definitely has changed my skin for the better
so far so good.
$98 is quite a lot to invest into a makeup product
i loved the result so much
works vs trying a bunch of cheaper products that probably won't show me as dramatic of results
also my pores were smaller than usual
a little goes a long way
my skin not only looks better
it does fade pretty quickly as well.
i've had so many compliments on my skin.
very little goes a long way
it has made my skin tone more even
my face is tighter
it may seem heavy at first
my skin has never looked better
i've gotten so many compliments
it made so much difference
after doing the rest of my routine i find that everything works 50% better than it does without it
a little goes a long way.
my skin tone is more even
very little goes a very long way
generally react quickly to products if they are not going to work
it is alot more even/clear
i feel like it helps the general appearance of my face to look more even
it's always better to pat on product
i just look healthier
taste is a little different at first
nothing is going to make you look years younger
generally makes my face look better
the fragrance is a bit too much for me
it's too early to notice long term results
a drop or two goes a loooong way too
my foundation definitely goes longer
applies sooo much smoother
this by far is the most amazing thing i've put on my face
my spots are getting brighter
if you're weary about the price consider how much you've spent on serums in the past
wouldn't you want them to be even more effective?
it looked better and felt better instantly!
whatever it is, my skin has never looked better!
makes my foundation look even more flawless
my skin actually feels... brighter.
however, its push pump is so hard to use.
it doesn't take much more than a pump, so a 6 oz.
although the glass gives it a more high end feel
the pump is also a little hard to use.
the pump is even worse
it would be that it was a little better at removing eye makeup
other than that i love it.
my skin is brighter, smoother and more even.
my makeup goes on much smoother
have even noticed that my skin looks more even on camera
this product has really helped my breakouts go away faster
my skin honestly did seem brighter after the first few uses also
i don't think it was less effective because of that
seemed to become less effective over time**i would also like to point out that i am young
because i'm not sure my skin needs much brightening
my skin has never looked better
i love this face wash so much.
it is however slightly more drying than purity.
price are good too
i've gone through so many br
skin looks more even and feels healthier!
it had gotten so much better.
it's cheaper than my previous cleanser
but overall it's pretty good so far.
so you got it be extra careful with it
can leave some residue if too much is used
still better than a jar of eye cream.
i still use a more intense cream at night
a little goes a long way
my skin looks and feels much nicer.
just a little is needed
however won't be buying this again as other cheaper moisturizers give the same results for much less
oh, and a little goes a long way!
more importantly is what it does for my skin
my skin has seriously never been smoother since using this product
pretty much breakout free
previous moisturiser had become too heavy
a little goes a long way.
my skin looks more even
$65 for me is wayyy too much.
now i wish i got the bigger size because this is amazing
i admit it is a little expensive
de is a tad stronger i think.
this by far has had an impact on my skin for the better
it is a bit of a heavier cream to me anyways
so as far as the actual product, it is an 11/10.
i love both so much
a little goes a long way
it actually has ingredients that tone
(a little bit goes a long way btw!
it is too soon to tell any brightening effects
all you need is a little bit.
give it a longer try
this made my make-up look even better.
i hardly ever repurchase a product twice because i enjoy always trying new formulas
i like it so much that i got my husb
it is much more "dewy" or greasy feeling
i figured out that i was using way too much product
thank goodness--makes a pricey product last longer
loved it so much i would deal with it
as i feel this makes it absorb better
it can get a little heavy in the summer
a little goes a long way
my foundation has never gone on smoother.
when using this product my skin is more plump
a little goes a long way
like i said it lasts a long time
and my skin is getting a little brighter.
at first i didnt think much of it
it is much better with it
i also like that it has more than one hyaluronic acid in there as so many br
s charge so much for just one
since i thought this might offer more moisture than i need
there is not much to complain about
i did also notice compliments about my skin happening more often after using this moisturizer
i love it so far.
it does have a little burning sensation sometimes when first put it on
maybe light is a better word
a little goes a long way
the price is a little high
you may have better results.
my skins quality is just better with this
a little goes a long way
i would consider this a "of winter" combo skin product as far as moisture goes
way too much for me
which is so bad
this is so light
a little goes a long way.
feel that the price tag is a little steep
a little goes a long way
so far it's great
i really like this moisturizer so far.
so far i prefer the josie maran moisturizer with spf a bit more
large pores to look much nicer
so far, so good!
the smell is way better than the old version
i felt a bit brighter
i'd probably use that more
it did made me break out a little white little dots
could not be happier
it works so well for my combination skin
sometimes the very small pimples that can eventually develop into a much bigger pimple
it got rid of those too
/or partying more than ever
a little goes a long way
this has done a better job of controlling them than anything else i've used
as with most serums a little goes a long way
it is so much brighter
they are not worse
it was just too much for my poor face
helps control how much you use
i really like it so far
however my face looks a lot healthier my breakout are fewer
my sample lasted for a good while so a little definitely goes a long way
my skin no longer burned or hurt when i moved
my skin soaks up the product so much
better than any pricy product i tried before.
the texture can be a little tricky to get used to at first
many of the other reviews will probably tell you that it comes out thick
it's lasted me quite a while
it is lasting me so long
i love how long it lasts
how little you need
it's is cheaper than the tacha water cream
you get more product
i think that it is better than the tacha water cream
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way
the formula is different than anything else i've ever used
overall this product works so well for me!
i received this too as a point perk
my skin is so much more healthy
my makeup stays more in place
which most moisturizers make things worse
this is giving my skin so much life right now.
almost feels primer like as well
it will look even greasier
it comes out of the tube a little thicker than a cream
i think it'd be better used when it isn't so cold
after applying i felt like i still needed more moisturizer
smooth after using it too
it has already started to help with some of the redness as i think it helps the other products work better
today no fewer than four people told me my skin looked great
so much that it would flake under my foundation throughout the day
now that it's doing better
i've not had as much problem with flakes since starting this
was hoping i would love this just as much or more
and i love it more.
a little goes a long way, wotb every penny
pretty much all fresh products
do so much more for my acne prone skin
a little goes a long way!
easily absorbed--give it about 5 minutes--it does not make me produce more oil during the day
the only con is that i am being a little obsessed by it
you want to keep as much air out of it as possible
so product isn't wasted
i would also say that there are less fine lines
so far so good
maybe i'll notice a bigger difference
it does irritate me a little so as another reviewer suggested i went to every other or sometimes even every 3 days
however, i still have lighter under eyes!
my skin looks brighter - somewhat cleaner too.2.
my skin never has felt too harsh though
however a little goes a looong way
my face is now smoother
6 little drops for your whole face
shockingly even notice how good my skin was looking after
i actually noticed my skin is much clearer
still have same feeling about it
i generally only used about 4-5 drops rather than the 5-7 they recommend
i found that i did get just a bit greasier than i might have before
i'll probably get to find out as a little goes a long way
since you need so little
the $150 price tag really isn't that much
it really has helped my skin to be more even toned as well
a little goes a long way
my makeup even glides on better right over this
i think it might be too much for a daytime moisturizer
i would like an addition of a little stronger scent
to make it a more relaxing experience when used
it has made my skin look so much more fresh
a little bit (5-6 drops max!)
which makes it much more affordable
i think it was a little better
so far that has worked out great for me
well i do not care much for
i would prefer a better scent or no scent at all
it was still painful
it last pretty long time tho
i did a little research
i often find expensive products not much better than cheaper alternatives
i always had a slightly oily t-zone, but no more.
although i have tried many higher-end
my foundation no longer goes on smoothly there
it goes on so smoothly, but not greasy.
they seem to be too messy
even though it comes with a heftier price tag
a little goes a long way
a little definitely goes a long way with this oil treatment
just a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way
just looked better overall
a little goes a long way
i can apply it a little heavier on days when my skin is extra thirsty without turning my face into an oil slick
apply a bit in the morning when i want a little extra boost
a little goes a long way
you don't have to worry about spilling it or getting more than you need
even though it is oil
my skin looked so much younger!!
nothing further than that
however i am not sure if it works better than the cream moisturizer i am more familiar with
in fact it has done very well for keeping my face at a even toned look
a little goes a long way
it still feels a bit greasy
i did a little experiment
because a very little bit of this goes a long way
create extra dryness just in case the oil was too much
by my fourth day i felt like i didn't even need as much because my skin was more hydrated
as a very little goes such a long way
so much better i'm gonna return the korres
spent way too much money
more importantly felt better
every where else is normal
it sinks right in giving my face so much hydration
it still made my face feel so smooth i'm not even exaggerating
a little goes a long way
like alot of products it really takes more than a day to judge
i wanted less makeup
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way
want to use it every night rather than just 2x per week as suggested
perhaps that made a difference?
a little bit goes a long way
because it lasts very long
it works well and still on my first bottle.
waking up in the morning tho is the best feeling because i no longer see tired-dull face
it is better than a moisturizer
feels like my skin is much healthier
the tone was more even
a little goes a long way
i learned how to just to do half a pump to get less product
if you don't use too much
too early for resultsi do love that this has a bit of shimmer
so far have received lots of compliments from friends
one more than the other.
a little goes a long way!
my skin no longer felt like it was stinging
wanted to try more from this line
the price is a little high
very few actually work
i will say that this is the best product i've tried so far for puffiness
wish it would glide on more smoothly
a little goes a long way.
so far so good.
my under eye area looks so much better
it would be so much easier if it was narrower
during winter i'll probably need to use something heavier
this has definitely helped so far
it is not as good as my usual eye cream
beware of not applying too much
both of those were slightly heavy for me
add a bit more of it too
less is more with this product
so far i'm loving it
it was like a normal serum, but a little better.
so far, it's looking good.
i've tried different sleeping mask so far i can say without a doubt that i like this one the most
a little goes a very long way
you don't have to use very much
it is a little expensive but i love the product
for those worried about the price or the small size of the product i have to say a little goes a very long way
i like this product so far.
so far so good.
so far it's a great product
within a month of using these ive noticed how much more firmer
i wish it were a little cheaper
i seriously start to have a clearer
my skin feels so much better, and looks brighter!
i can say that i do see my skin much brighter.
a little goes a long way
definitely less than a month
if it was cheaper i would used it everyday for that as well
it has helped my skin so much.
its not like it could make things worse at this point
haven't used it for too long.
i love it so far!
makes my skin feel softer long after use
so far, i love it.
nothing have work so far
a little goes a long way
all have not given me much in the way of results.
this is more than i have ever wanted to spend on skin care
exfoliation seem to last longer since i've been using this
i find it dries out my skin a little bit too much for daily use
i couldn't be happier
i love this on more my body than face
my skin has never been softer or more clear
great product even though it's a bit messy!
it's results are more long-term
my skin is much more clearer
it is a product more on the pricey side
this mask improved my skin so much
my skin looks more even
makes it easier to squeeze out
i leave mine on a little longer
i notice that the longer i have it on
the better a job it does
so far so great .
a little hesitant when i saw that suffer was one of the ingredients
if you spray a little of that on first the mask will spread easier
so far this product is amazing.
little goes a long way.
my skin looked better in general
i must say it took considerably longer to arrive then my usual sephora purchase
i even think it helps calm it-spreads easily -goes well under makeup- i could see a difference when used
my skin has never looked better.
no more wasting product!!
probably won't be repurchasing seeing as i haven't much luck with illuminating moisturizers
i also don't feel like there is too much glitter
a little goes a long ways!
i've tried so many different moisturizer
just want something a little less
i can't wait to see how much more it can improve with increased usage
i would never spend this much on a mask
none have done what this one has
it does everything it claims, and more.
i've tried other masks as well you name it by far the best one with actual results you see right away
there may have been little product in it
a bit difficult to spread-in hindsight
also fills in my tiny fine lines so makeup goes on better
i do feel that my eyes are more lifted as well
a little goes a long way
the darker ones look about 30% lighter after 2 weeks of use
i don't typically spend too much on skin care
makeup application is much easier
in some cases better than
turn red from just about every product that has less than skin friendly ingredients
so far i have had no breakouts or any side effects
you do not need very much and it absorbs quickly.
i am going to use one in cold times too
my skin looked so much brighter
you may be watering it down too much
it not only makes my face a bit brighter
there is nothing easier than a mask that takes only 10 seconds to work
i personally think that is diluting the product too much
how i don't have to gauge how much to use
if you take some effort to place it in areas that need more attention
i find it to be a heavier moisturer
two is a bit too much
my friends with more oily skin may not like the heavier feeling of this cream
some days i need a bit more
sometimes i use 2 beads for a bit more.
a lot better than some others i've tried recently
just a tad bit of luminosity coming through
it makes my skin look better
it has helped my makeup to stay on longer
i really like it thus far
lasts even longer than any other primer i have tried
how much you will love it
can no longer use it- which i'm bummed about because this product actually works
my makeup has never looked better.
my foundation has never looked better.
it has changed my life as i am no longer worried about my makeup even after 8 hours
i rarely find a product that works so quickly
it deserves so much more hype.
a little goes a long way!
it will make your skin look tighter.
my skin has been looking a lot better after 3 days
as far as being a primer
still have makeup on unlike before
i personally think that is way too much
but then makeup stays so well!
this just feels like a much more high quality product
i started getting samples rather than buying
will definitely be making the switch to tackier primers like this one
so far i do like it
like a day or more!
my skin looked even better than before
my skin has gotten much oilier
if not you have to make more effort to smooth it on
i don't feel like it's too much or too heavy
my foundation has never ever looked as smooth
my only grip is that as many others have said
i think i'll love it even more in the upcoming winter months
i spent so much money
although i found products that helped control it a little i never found anything that really helped clear it up
it stings a little if you have any irritated areas
it has helped even out my skin
this is just one more added to many others.
don't use too much
i've never had better skin
i hope they come up with something better
less product is always more.
little goes a long way
i love it so far
so far i really like it
i've used pretty much every high end product out there
a little goes a long way.
which is more than enough for my entire face
i love this so much!
my skin has only improved more
i am not wearing as much makeup
my skin has never looked better
depending on how much makeup i've been wearing
i liked this one more than the resurfacing mask.
said this will take care of the deeper congestion on my skin
is on the stronger side
each time my skin looked no better or more hydrated
however while this is fun to try i'll never purchase it because it's so exorbitantly expensive
no more so than if i just washed my face
on those days when you really need that extra oomph
i love this mask so much.
you should be more than happy with this product
i know this is pricy for a little
so far it's been great
a little bit goes a long way.
love it so much
slightly different if that makes any sense at all
then mix a little with my foundation too
when i use this mixed in with foundation i like the results better
just a little bit of this mixed in doesn't change the formulas of my foundations
it's gotten a lot better as i've grown up out of adolescence
nteresting that you could use it in so many ways
there are much better matte primers out there
nothing in comparison to without this
i am in my 30s so less is more.
a little bit goes a long way for me!
not only does it apply much easier
figured i should start giving more attention to my skin
only after 2 uses did i already notice a better overall colour in my skin tone
the bottle is small but a little goes a long way.
a little goes a long way!
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way
are still there a little bit
so much as it is to prevent them
a little goes a long way!
will maybe try other less-expensive products in the future that work more on other eye-area issues as well
both together have made my eye look much better
so far i like it more than the algenist
the little white thing around my eye was caused by fresh now seems getting smaller
i love it so much with both of them!
you can see how much product is left
my under eyes no longer look tired
for a lack of a better term
plumps eye area with just a bit of added brightening to make it even better
the only thing i wish was the price was a little lower
this product does more
so this was more than i like to spend
a little goes a long way
wish it was cheaper though.
this is more than i normally like to spend on moisturizer
more bang for your buck
if you're getting a little older
ladies a little bit older in years might prefer something a bit heavier
my pores look a little bit smaller
so far i'm loving it
i look forward to using this all summer when my skin becomes a little bit more oily
it lasts a long time because so little is needed
i think this is a little too heavy for my combination/cycstic acne-prone skin
it's just slightly too heavy for me
this helps so much!
this seems to even out my skin all around
my skin never looked better
wake up with a much brighter
hours later my skin feels more supple than it would with other products i've tried
i love this so much
although it is a bit pricier
it is more than enough
but a little bit goes a long way.
i struggled for so long with my skin
very nice product so far
ended up going with this mainly because the price was $5 cheaper
a little bit too oily for me
maybe better in winter
i wish the price point was a little lower
my makeup applies so much better too.
prefer a richer cream for night drunk elephant never disappoints
it takes longer to absorb than i prefer
a little does go a long way
i wake up with what other people probably think is normal
this line has improved my skin so much
hopefully it lasts a while longer
the price is too much
the product is not as much
my texture is better than before
the feeling actually lasts
while it turns to be hotter
tired all the time lately
the pimples get so much better
it works ever better
a little bit goes a long way
the price hurts me a little
i love it so much i looks past it
it's just too good but too pricey too.
one pump is too much product
curios to see any changes or if i'll repurchase as it is quite pricy as well as see how long it lasts me
for better or worse
so far no problems
yet not too heavy at the same time
love this cream so much.
actually feels much lighter when you smooth it on
love this so much.
the cost is a bit more than i would usually spend
and a little goes a long way!!
makes me wonder how old this product is since the new packaging has been out for quite some time
a little goes a long way
you don't need to use very much at a time.
this treatment truly makes you look more rested without any uncomfortable feeling of tightened skin
don't actually make the skin look healthier
sadly i think that it will last very little
a little goes a long way.
after a moisturizer with even better results
you do need to leave it on for a little bit
a little goes a very long way.
but a little goes a long way!!
can feel a little heavy on the face
helps foundation to appear a bit more dewey
a little glamglow goes a long way
i love this product so much.
box and have really enjoyed it so far!
i also find that a little bit of the product goes a long way for me
making the price feel a little bit more manageable
it made me feel so much more confident about my bare skin
it does a better job
i just have too many scars
none of my past or current eye products were doing much to tighten the skin there
makes you look younger
$140 is much less than $5000, for surgery!
but other than that, i loved it.
it looks fuller, in a good way!
this product is back and better than ever.
a little really goes a long way
use it pretty much every day
have had little success
it works so much better
my skin is a lot smoother
there isn't as much redness as there was before
a little bit goes a long way
i don't care too much for the smell
my skin has never looked better !
they only made it worse
it only takes a little bit
it didn’t do much in terms easing the issue
a lot of the other oils you see by more mainstream br
it does more harm than good in the long run
pay a little bit more for something that is 100% pure
a little goes a long way
so much better than boscias charcoal cleanser!
a little goes a long way.
was a little reluctant to try anything new on it
so this product will last quite a while
i found that this was even better
it's much cheaper than some other face washes
a little goes a long way
my face looks more clear since using it.
i get much less breakouts.
a little goes a long way so don't use too much.
a little hard to wash off
it is better than any other drug store br
a little goes a long way
assuming things couldn't get any worse
this actually made it a whole lot better
this works better than the remover
skin clearer and more balanced.
before adding moisturizer my face feels a bit drier than usual-
so far so good.
i am loving this cleanser so far!
so that might be it too
a little goes a long way
make it even more red
s that work nowhere as well
also, a little goes a long way
i honestly expected a little bit more
my skin felt better
it's a little rough for everyday use though.
definitely buying the bigger bottle ❤
it has helped so much with texture
i've had small bumps instead of my usual bigger breakouts which i guess means that it has been working
my face feels so much softer & looks 10x better.
my skin is so much smoother
nothing else has ever worked as well.
i love this product so much!
you only need to use a little bit
so far i'm enjoying it
so far i recommend it
this is better than rose cream for summer
i feel it keeps my makeup looking fresher for longer
i honestly have found more benefit from this product than from chemical peels
no one wants messy jars of anything any more!
so much that i gave up on foundation
so far this has been working out well for me!
this keeps my face matte for more hours than others
a little bit goes a long way for me
like it only during the day as its really good for using more as a light moisturizer
this is a little different in that it's also a primer
the only thing that would make this better is if it had sunscreen in it
just slightly more hydrating than the others out there
i just use a little bit mostly in my t-zone
i see a lot of people saying it is a better primer than a moisturizer
i do feel that i have other primers that work 100 times better than this
it does have a little bit of a pore filling effect
i love this so much 10/10 recommend
a little goes a long way!
it does make my skin look better on its own.
while i liked rather than loved it
i feel it is more of a base for makeup rather than a daily moisturizer since it doesn't feel rich enough it
this product has worked better as a primer than anything else i've tried
i enjoyed this so much more than i thought i would
it's smoother and my tone is more even.
while this doesn't keep me matte any longer than normal
have noticed my makeup goes on a little more flawless
i put this stuff on much heavier than a regular moisturizer
i appreciate that this product comes in a tube rather than a jar
could not recommend more!
the product is so concentrated- you only need a little to do the job
it better be good
i still saw less pep in my skin
was more of an all-in-one
sometimes at night as well
a little goes a long way
so far this product delivers everything it claims
my only complaint is there isn't more in the bottle
money very well spent
even better it's a 5 in 1 product!!!!
i love this product so much
as long as it does the job the smell is the least of my worries
this is a better bang for your buck
even works as well if not better than my eye creams
i love it so much !
my skin has never felt softer or more consistently great ever
i love it so far
a little goes a long way
it took it the better part of the day to feel like it had been absorbed
this is the reason i feel like this would make a better sleeping mask than used as a daily moisturizer
a little of this product goes a long way the more you rub it in the thinner it becomes allowing for it to cover a large area without requiring multiple pumps
it does have a stronger scent
i love this product so much
i try not to apply to much though to the oily areas of my face because it does make it worse
it actually works too!!
one pump is enough for my face and neck as well.
not too much or too little for myself.
by using this cream my skin got way better
better than any primer i have used on the market
loved it so much i made the hour or so trek to a real sephora to buy it
i did a little bit of reading about it
was even more off put
probably more from this line
this hasn't left me greasy or oily in the few times i've used it so far
it is too heavy for me to wear during the day
in 35 years of life i don't think there has been a more perfect moisturizer on the planet
the smell is a bit much though.
a little bit of this goes a long way.
i always end up squeezing out too much
i wish it was a little bit darker
as i'm getting closer to the age 50
i’ve never had better skin in my life.
my skin hasn't looked better
my skin seems calmer as far as breaking out
though this may have improved it a small bit
i do wish it cost a bit less
i know this will help tremendously with the hotter months
spent way too much money looking
skin can only absorb so much.
i most certainly get less pimples since i started using this
the good thing is that a little amount goes a long way
i tried so many things
my skin has never looked better
nor have i ever received more compliments in my life
as the day goes by i get more
any foundation i apply over top of this looks better than ever
"i have tried so many things
others not so much
you can definitely get a better moisturizer than this for a lower price
has actually helped minimize the appearance of them over time as well
it almost feels like too much
ever since i started using it i have gotten so many compliments on it
i realized i used too much
two pumps is more than enough for me
be even better if it was cheaper
i love tatcha so so so so much
it works--more than works--it seriously makes me look healthy
rather than putting make-up on
at first i applied a little too much it made my face feel sticky
when u only use a little bit theres no stickiness it made my face softer it looked more even
my makeup goes on so much smoother
more than the tacha product alone
probably put on too much at once
my face has never looked better
my skin is so much happier
let me say a little big goes a long way.
with as little as you need to apply i would imagine that it stretches
a little bit goes a long way.
as far as oil control
my makeup stays so much longer
it absorbed much better
making it last longer- or by itself
i've discovered that this gel looks much better when i use just half a pump
a little goes a long way.
the price is a little high
too often are too much
i wiish they would make a bigger stick for a more reasonable price
mpressed as i've actually found my face is much less oily on the mornings i use this
get better results by first using the frxxxtion stick
this product makes it so much easier
so you want it to last you a little while
this works so well
not sure if the full size is similar or if it goes a longer way
i love this so much!!
i've definitely noticed my skin has become more even-toned since i started using this
my skin has never felt cleaner or been clearer in my entire life
i would highly recommend even thought it does cost a bit more than it probably should
this has honestly helped out so much
it really delivers on the results of clearer
products used after this go on so much more evenly
my foundation applied much better after using this product
my skin has never looked better
i find that it works better on me as just a cleanser
the only con to this product is that it melts a little bit if you put too much water on it
don't think that a little goes a long way
i just bought the regular size because i loved it so much
this works so well
a little goes a long way
my makeup goes on nicer too
my skin not only feels better, it looks better.
gives me an even surface to work with every time
this helps me so much when i start to breakout or my pores feel a little more noticeable or ruff looking
i simply did circles across my entire face making it pretty even throughout
the only downside i can think of is that it is pretty expensive
as far as feeling
like a very fine microdermabrasion that you could probably use a few times per week
my pores actually appear to be better too.
combination skin has done well with this
actually cause more damage by making micro cuts rather than what they should do which is slough off dead skin
it isn't too harsh and it works well.
so far i have only used this as an exfoliator not the mask
as mess-less as possible
my skin feels so much softer
so much easier/less messy than exfoliators in pots
admittedly i was a little sceptical
so far, though, i'm all smiles!
the next morning after using this they looked much better
it was so dark
it's actually very little product for the price
anyway i still like it better than any other exfoliator i have tried
works just as well
which isn't very big for the cost
it goes on so easily
a little goes a long way
other than that it smells
it worked sooooo much better removed so much
its a little harsh on the skin so just be careful
it did tingle a little at first
not much more than any other peel off mask
i used this on pretty much everything below my eyes
i seemed to have to use quite a bit of product to get a good even layer
feel one would go through a tube of this faster than other masks
it works far better than any cleanser ive tried
although i have to say it did hurt a little around my under eye area
was a bit difficult to get off in places
my pores did look smaller--which many products have tried
my face feels much more fresh after this peel than any face wash i've used in years
this product is without a doubt better than anything i have ever tried
it makes the absorption a bit slower than i'd like
the smell stays on the skin for a long time as well
even though i mainly use it for my face
i find it more drying than i would like around my eyes
works well enough as the only cleansing product if short on time
i do use it as part of a longer routine
more a one like this naturally
i did only give it 4 stars because it is a little stripping
even after the 1st use my face felt way better than it did with any other cleanser
my skin recently broke out way worse than usual
half a pump is more than enough
your skin fights breakouts a lot more quicker
this more gets the dirt
a little pump can cover your whole face.
so far so good.
ever since i have started using this cleanser it has pretty much all gone away
my face has been clearer than ever!
how much it has helped my skin
i've seen other cleansers do better
a little more drying than what i'd like
there isn't much of a smell to the product
the foam is actually more condensed than i expected
a little bit goes a long way — i use one pump to wash my face in the evenings
think it might've been too much
way better than any higher priced foaming cleansers i've tried ever
my skin feels better and looks healthier already.
plus it is packed with so many good
definitely looking into some more neogen products to add to my regimen
it's so great that sephora is carrying more
skin will become better
working as good or maybe even better
a little goes a long way
makes my skin look so much better
love this so much!
how much a little goes a long way i was sold
i notice i stay matte for a lot longer than i normally do
will definitely look into more products
skin looks and feels better after using.
a little bit goes a long way
i can't wait to use it some more to see more results
all so much more than i could have asked for!!
higher price made me expect a lot out of my experience
a little bit goes a long way
as well as fewer breakouts
do not leave on more than 10 minutes
both pump bottles have a line on the side to show how much product is left
it don't take much
i don't have much acne at my age however
they are a bit pricey
though i've had it much longer than that now
so far so good!
already my pores look a lot smaller.
my face looks so much brighter
also the tube lasts a really long time.
it does make my skin look brighter
which i definitely wasn't expecting to get so the larger tube should last a while
my skin immediately looked better
pro's: not much of a scent to it
would probably be better for those with skin on the oily side
1 staple beauty product there is nothing better i bet my life on it
i like the consistency so much
a little goes a long way
so far though, praise!
i found that a little goes a long way with this product
so far i see an improvement in fine lines
mpressed by how well it spread over my face: a little went a long way
however much i love it though
i would also rather get the pump rather than the container version because i feel that it's more hygienic
it would have gotten 5 stars
seems to work well under makeup.
a little goes a long way.
the only thing is that it's pretty pricey as the bottle is only half-full
a little goes a long way
you can take the amount you need with the spoon instead of using too much
a little goes a long way
was a little worried that this might be too heavy for my skin
i think it might be a little too heavy for the spring
it's one of those products where a little bit goes a long way
a little bit goes a long way
the bottle lasts for a long time as you don't need to use a lot-- a little goes a long way
more often than not i have to make 2-3 passes with a makeup remover to feel confident the majority of the products have been removed
very seldom do i have to go back
thankfully its rarely ever necessary
it is a lighter/looser oil with a pump so you need to cup your h
it's pricey but lasts quite a long time.
however, a little goes a long way.
worth the money- takes off makeup much more effectively than anything else i've used
a little goes a long way
my pores became much smaller
a little goes a long way!
my skin has never felt cleaner.
always dried my skin even more than it already is
it is no longer an oil
this is a much thinner consistency
a little goes a long way in removing every trace of makeup
i think if i use more product it will emulsify better
overall though, not bad.
it is much lighter than the murad in consistency
eye makeup much better
this stuff is better.
this one is a little different
it broke down my heavy foundation much more quickly than my other oils
loved it i was squeezing as much as i could on the 3rd
don't really need to moisturizer during the day too much
so a little goes a long way
my skin is a little more glowy
don't need too much
don't need too much
it made my makeup stay on longer
it's a little bit light for the winter
a little goes a long way
however this is far thinner
a little goes a long way
looking way older than it should have
so maybe it appealed to my skin more than others
i love this product so much!!
my skin looks better too
a little goes a long way.
a little goes a long way.
liquidy texture so a little goes a long ways
it looks more clear and even.
however it absorbs so quickly into my skin that i feel like i use more than i usually would
a little goes a long way.
need something much lighter during the day under my primer
i wonder if this is better on slightly aging skin
you may need something a little heavier for a night cream
i just wish it came in a bigger container.
a little goes a long way, dries fast.
also, a little goes a long way.
this kept me matter for 8 hours which was good enough for a dull day at work
on warmer days i only use this cream nothing else
this comes the closes i've found to helping tame my skin from too much shine considering houston's climate
it just gets better
it helps my makeup last longer
have always had issues finding moisturizers for my face to the point where i mostly never bothered using it
keeps it mattified for a long time
still have pretty greasy skin i thought would dissipate as i got older
a little goes a long way
it can sting a little bit
my makeup seems to stay put better since i have added this into my routine
spf components make it that much better
you only need a little bit, but it does the job.
it looks better everyday
i think the 8 hour mattifying claim would probably work better outside of hawaii
i would buy again if i can't find anything better for cheaper
i gave 4 stars because i could use just a little more moisture
so far love this product.
it this were a few bucks cheaper
it even lasts a whole work day.
i'd say it controls oil very well for about 4-5 hours
this is much better at not making me super shiny than any other moisturizer i've tried
not too thick or too think.
the texture is a bit thicker than i expected
that one was too intense
it burns my eyes a little bit if it gets in them
and i must say my skin has never looked better.
am careful about how much i use
just a little goes a long way!
i loved it so much that i got the serum too!
i think is way too expensive
a little tiny bit goes a long way.
a little goes a long way.
i love this product so much.
if it was any more expensive
is too big to carry on a flight
the bumps that was there are going away as well
for me a little goes a long way
the first thing i'm going to say about this product is that you should expect your skin to get worse before it gets better
my skin is soooo much better
i like this better than any other acne treatment i have used
other than that my skin has never been better
my skin has never looked better
to give a little bit of a background
i broke out more than usual
any more than 2-3 drops
'll give it 4 stars only because of how much it costs
going from wearing little to no makeup to wearing a full face about more than half the week
my face is clearer than it's ever been in years
a little goes a long way
my skin just feels more refined
skin is already getting so much better
as far as i know
my face was more even in tone
i've never really broken out much
heal a lot faster than they did beford
a little goes a really long way
my skin got marginally worse when i first started using it
i've noticed that they don't last as long or they aren't as aggressive as they have been in the past
put way too many products on my face
think my problem is probably more of clogged pores
a little goes a long way so even tho i thought i was crazy paying $40 for
a couple drops will be more than enough
it was waaaaaay too much
not as bad as juno but worse than good genes.
it just doesn't smell nearly as good as most luxury skin care
smells far worse than no scent at all
a little goes a long way
now it is so much better
my skin is much less clogged
is it better than any other mositerizer type product i've tried before?
decided to spend a little more than i usually do
which makes it so difficult to find products that actually work
worse now at 41 than in my younger years
tried quite a few to cover my problem areas
the spots that we already there looked a lot smaller
while sometimes i felt like it was no longer doing anything
have spent a lot of money on it
no other combination of products has been able to do that so far
i would say i have fairly normal
i love this oil so much.
the others are significantly much smaller
this has helped my skin so much.
it made it more flawless
a little goes a long way
i couldn't be happier
is pretty much gone
my skin has never looked better
goes away so much faster than ever before
makeup wears so much better on my skin now too!
better then anything that my dermatologist has given me
this oil is magic i found this one works better than the luna oil
it feels more like a regular oil compared to the luna
she mentioned that my increasingly oily t-zone could mean i need more moisture
it is so light
made my skin overall so much better
they were either too harsh
make my skin worse
so far, i have no regrets!
some were better than others
for 6 years i have tried so many things
my skin texture is also much smoother.
i've gotten to use it now
i love this mask so much!!
my makeup goes on better as well.
i normally wouldn't spend so much on a face mask
too expensive for my liking
i love it so much.
each product actually does last quite a while
just a little over $20 an ounce *sad face*.
make my skin so much softer and smooth.
i do look less tired
a little goes a long way.
it looked even better
rather than leaving my skin angry
i even ate a little bit gel
a little of this mask goes a long way.
my face looks so much more refreshed since using this
it was a little out of my normal price range
bright after using- what could be bad about that?
it was a little hard to take off
so much of his ideas come from traditions that actually work
he couples that with science so that they can become even more effective
unfortunately the $80 cdn price tag is a little much to have in my skin routine
my bags looked a bit more volumized
have been on the hunt for something that will brighten my skin as much as this did
just over all... better.
so much so that i sometimes don't want to put makeup on since my face looks so naturally lit up
my makeup look so much smoother
at first sight i was a little put off it pretty much resembles orange marmalade
nor did my face feel any oilier than normal
it is a lot harder to clean
the price tag is a little steep for what it is
took off a star because the texture is a little too chunky for me
a little difficult to spread around
nothing has seemed to work
it is a little pricey
my skin got even better with its matching cleanser
the only reason i gave it four stars is because it irritates my eyes a little bit
this product not only makes they go away a lot faster
although it is a little expensive i can guarantee it will work for you
it actually looked like it has a more pink under tone than anything
it actually keeps my face matte longer
i wish it lasted longer.
giving it 4 stars because it is expensive.
it's a little bit rough
my skin has never looked better
also has improved my skin over all so when i go without i still have a healthy glow
my makeup has never looked more natural or better
you get more for a better price
what i've found is that this product is a dream when worn with little to no makeup on top
i've never received so many compliments on looking fresh
little just under the eye
lately i just look fresh
a little goes a long way
you only need a little bit
this has helped so much with the scarring!!!
i find it lasts a long while too.
better than the black one from same br
i guess with this one i will have to use it a bit more often then which is not too bad because it's easier to peel it off
works better when you massage in first
this has done a lot to even my skin tone
it will last a long time with how little i have to use
a little goes a long way
a little bit goes a long way
so far i love it
i let it soak in as much as i can
even feel confident enough to go out without the usual layers of concealer i was using
a little goes a long way
i no longer have breakouts
those little white bumps i haven't seen too much improvement in
love it as well for days when my skin is a little more dry
was only getting worse
i will say it is much better
t is a huge plus that it requires so little product to be effective
it made me break out more
this product helped me so much with this.
that may mean that your skin may become worse as all of the toxins are coming to the surface
before it gets better
a little certainly goes a long way too
i like how much it foams
my makeup has never gone on better!!
my skin hasn't looked this good in quiet some time
getting another one for her as well!
morning for better results
as well as the rest of the belif line
this is the one i'm reaching for more often
a little goes a long way.
the more i use it the more glowing
this is much more cost efficient for the amount of product you get
results from much less expensive masks
a little easier to rinse than the honey i was using
maybe i need to use it even more?
my pores seemed bigger for a little while after
healthier looking than it's ever been
my skin is looking better than it has in a while
i just wish it was a little less intense
my pores were smaller too!
the rest of my face is fairly normal
i went out today to get a sample of the mask since i loved the salve so much
this review is too long
using this mask makes my own skin feel more comfortable
makeup application is so much easier
the warming feeling takes a little while to get used to
it makes the spot so much smoother
i did notice my skin was definitely softer than before
it is rather pricey
it hasnt done much for my skin besides make its softer which is always a plus
a little goes such a long way
it worked even better
i feel like the benefits were way better
which has never looked better
i would recommend not using too much though since i noticed that on my upper lip it did sting a bit which is typical of a lot of products for me
it was so much better
like most masks you do not need a generous amount like many of them say
i am the kinda person who pays no more than 20$ on one item
i love this product so much this is first time i got this
my makeup goes on better
which i find is more pleasing
i still have a lot more product
goes to show a little goes a long way.
a little really goes a long way
skin tone was more even
my skin feels and is acting so much healthier.
it actually feels a lot warmer on my skin
it's beyond difficult getting all of it out
it was a lot warmer than i was used to
my skin is always so much brighter in the morning
a little goes a long way
i can see people with oily skin loving this too bc its just so amazing my skin has improved so much looks so even
it is also a better price than a lot of similar masks
a little goes a long way
i loved it so much i went
i think the warmth may be too much for some
that there was real honey in it too
i love this so much
my skin has never looked better..finally!
also started to feel better
so far it was not drying on my face.
so far this is working out great.
i give it 4 stars because it is a bit pricey
my skin is much better
it's a bit more expensive than my previous face soap
feels so much better
is looking better every day
i like it so far
a little goes a long way with this great spot treatment
found them to be a little expensive
a little goes a long way
so far i have not been let down
this stuff seems far more convenient to me
i don't have breakout any more
it doesn't do too much for the smaller white heads or blemishes as much
i think more people should try it.
first time in my life i've ever gotten something that worked so well
didn't do much for scars or larger areas though
this spot treatment is so good it shrinks them in half with just one use
the pimples become much smaller
not too much shimmer
don't look right with too much luminizers
a little goes a long way
the bottle comes with vey little
goes on smooth and even.
a little goes a long way
how much i use of it
i feel like i'm using too much
it seems gets make up off better then the milk does
i do like the regular one better
especially during winter when i don't want to do too much before makeup
my favourite product so far.
use something a little more heavy duty
so far it's been great.
even though it is a splurge product
couldn't believe how much if firmed my skin
a little goes a long way
about 10 minutes after i apply this my skin looks so much more plump
they both work so well
my crows feet have gotten better
i wish it were a bit cheaper because the tube is small
wearing foundation everyday dries me out even more
it immediately made my skin look better
i do that 4 or more times a day
i did notice my skin was much smoother
although i do notice more of a difference at night
this is working so well!"
mainly because it actually works.
it is a little odd to use at first
face just look better
the sample lasted much longer than was expected
i can comfortably say that this makes a difference for me
i've seen some review saying that the scent is too much
by adding a little water
the skin even looks smoother as well
fresher especially dealing with computer all day long
my one improvement would be to make this more affordable as it is hard to justify spending this much on 1
i really wanted to wait a little longer
my skin looks so much brighter
i feel so much more confident with no makeup on
this product does so much for me
it makes you skin so much better.
it looks like i've barely used any
so far it doing good
a little pricey for a bar
you get so much use out of one bar
so a good deal too
best face wash i've gotten so far!
i do think this one is better for the following reasons
it removes all my makeup just as well if not better
this is much more effective
i love this cleanser so far.
i can already notice my skin becoming a bit more clear
there is a ton of product, too.
a little goes a long way.
i wish it wasnt so expensive
have found it harder to find sufficient time to use compared with other masks
it came off so much easier than a regular mask
a little goes a long way
the reason i say to use a thin layer is because like i said a little goes a long way
i still have a lot left
needs a little more moisture in their life
you need way less product than you think for it to work
so far so good
so far so good
the only thing is- i wish the magnet was a bit bigger
anyone have a better idea how to get the mask of the magnet ?
i spend more time cleaning up than the actual mask itself
after using this my skin felt much more plump
not much helps them out
a little goes a long way so don't put too much on ur skin
not only does it work very well
i wish it were a tad less expensive
as other reviewers have mentioned it is alittle messy
as much as i like this
if anything it is a little bit of a long process
but this is slightly cheaper, and way more fun!
it's a little greasier than what i usually use
its been so tired lately
it was a little time consuming to take off
feel so much more fine
which having breakout prone skin can only make things more difficult to heal
sucks they are out of stock because even though it runs out super quick when used twice a day based on the results i have seen so far it is so worth is
this produce has no joke helped my skin so much.
my skin has calmed down so much
application is a little messy
i've tried so many masks
some people are saying its hard to get an even layer
this mask is better than treatments i've spent over 100 on
my skin does feel much better
this is so different/better
but still love it.
while it's not offensive it does make it harder to enjoy the product
my skin color is more even
i needed something stronger in a different way
this has changed my life my skin is so smooth also my pores are way smaller i'm no longer afraid to be seen bare face or wear highlight
my lines are very much reduced
the lines by my mouth look so much better!
the tone looks more even
healthier looking after only one week
my skin feels smoother already
i find a little goes a long way whenever i use retinol to avoid over doing it
this product actually does what it says and more!
loving this product so far.
it makes it feel a bit more extravagant for that of a cleanser
a little goes a long way
a little goes a looking way
a little goes a long way.
the glass bottle is a bit much
a little goes a long way
need i say more?
a little goes a long way with this concentrated product
i only use it at night when i feel like i have more dirt
i also noticed my acne going away little by little
don't regret paying a little more
i am getting more
i don't expect too much on a cleanser
skin is softer, brighter, more even.
it's been so so so good to me so far
as far as i can tell
since using this product my skin has never looked or felt better
i love it so far
it dries out my skin too much
it seems very average to me.
t may work better for you or in a more humid climate
just a little went a long way
my skin has seriously never looked better
the only downfall i have is that even though you get a lot of product for the price
still look 22 yrs younger from taking good care of my skin
you only need to use a little bit.
my skin has changed so much already
my skin actual stays more even throughout the day than it does with any other cleanser i've tried
making my skin look even clearer
a little bit goes a long way
my nose actually looks more defined.
a little goes a long way also you get 8 ounces which is amazing
was actually more into it for the cleanser
this does just that, and no extra oilyness.
my skin looks better even without makeup
has an even tone
it comes with a little spatula to help scoop out the very last bit of it when the time comes
i couldn't be happier with this purchase.
i still like that
a little bit of product goes a long way
i also think it made my makeup go on smoother.
i no longer have acne on my face
my face even felt softer after i used this product
then it would become too expensive
feels better in the morning
i normally don't like to spend this much on face cream
my skin is looking remarkably better
texture that i like very much
my skin is much more plump
a little goes a long way
my skin has never looked better
i normally don't think too much of any one moisturizer
i definitely notice my skin looks more plump
within 3 weeks of using this product they are noticeably more shallow
there are just so many
not only was the amount more than expected
what was inside was even more amazing
as much as i love this
this i might even like a little more lol
this might not work as well
my skin has never been so smooth
or someone who lives in a harsher climate might need something heavier
starting using this stuff my skin is nicer than its been in a couple years
please note the morning cries were way shorter
a little amount goes a long way.
i usually like to use this if i want a bit more hydration
i will try to look for something a little cheaper that has similar ingredients with a little more product
it's just noticeably better
putting on makeup i've been reaching for this one too
i think i would repurchase this since i like this much better than other moisturizers that i've been trying past few months
even out the tone
my break outs are finally getting better
they do look much lighter
the texture of my skin is a lot better
i wish it helped more with fine lines
it doesn't have too much effect on me
i see it as more prevention for more aging damage
i feel that my pores are tighter as well!
but a little goes a long way!
pores look smaller than they ever have
it seems to have helped my dark circles as well
my skin is getting much smoother
you may be using too much of it
no longer have to use foundation all over
i couldn't be happier with this.
has never looked healthier
i usually just spot it on as a little goes a long way
i just wish they had it in a shade lighter
i just wish it came in a lighter shade because this summer glow isn't going to last very long
no more foundation needed for casual days!!!
a little goes a long way too
it is a little on the dark side
it is definitely more like a mattefying foundation than a skin care "cream"
doesnt give too much coverage while completely reducing all the redness on my face
i wish there was a lighter color
so this actually tones it down
a little then would go such a long way for me
much better than what color correcting has done for me
seriously this lasts for so long even with my everyday use
the color was much too dark
instead it's more of a foundation
no more redness; no more scares.
no more cake face in the summer for me
adding a little moisturizer seems to help
they might as well make some more shades
feel as if 20$ or 25$ would be more fair
you really only need a tiny amount since it goes a long way
using too much will result in cakiness
fingers work well too!
- a little of this goes a long way.
don't use too much, though, or it'll cake up
a little does go a long way
a very little bit goes such a long way which makes the amount of coverage it gives even more amazing
a little of this product goes quite a ways for me when applying it with a beautyblender
so then i always apply too much too my face just to even everything out
for me it is plenty without
i gave it only four stars because given the thinner consistency of the product i feel like it should be in a tube
more of a primer that really blends the skin tone to make your foundation cover more
i took one star off because it does feel a little heavy
a little goes a loooong way.
i see a lot of complaints about this only coming in one shade
i would recommend to start out pretty conservatively with this
it does seem to match better on my "summer" skin shade
i just wish they'd offer a lighter shade
hope to see more it products at sephora!
feels better than nothing
this works better than i expected!
a little goes a long way.
only wish they made it in a tube so less messy.
a little bit goes a long way.
other probably have a problem getting it too match
a dab really goes a long way so this jar will last anyone a very long time
a little goes a long way.
if i looked too "make upy" he said "no
i mix a tiny bit with my foundation to get a better color for me
a little goes a long way.
i assume the reviews saying this is too dark for them used way to much product
a little goes a long, long ways.
works great and a little goes far.
this product is even better than the cc cream for my skin
the only thing that would make this better is spf
i wish it lasted longer
just a *very little bit* gets the job done.
i wish it were a bit more matched to my skin tone
this product is a little too good
a title goes a long way too!!
it is still there
it is a bit too dark for me
it was way too dark
a little bit goes a long way
i do wish it were a tad lighter
i just wish they had more shades
a little does go a long way.
still use it because its a lot easier to lighten my skin then cover bright red
a little does go a long way
you barely have to use any
it just seems less costly when you buy it.
maybe i used too much at a time??
i still think for $60 there should be more product
i love this product so far.
a little goes a long way!
so much less messy than cleansing oils
this product will last a long while as a little goes a long way
it works better then most of my eye make up remover's have in the past
i generally use better than sex by too face
a little bit goes a long way.
decided to try this one out and i like it better.
it seems to work a bit faster with less product at getting everything off
the only thing is i wish you got a little more product for the amount it costs
a lot of the jar is just thick plastic i think to make it look bigger which is we just size up by the eye looks like more product
i can say i like this one better then clinque as clinque at times would irritate my skin especially if any got into my eye
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way
to me it is a tad on the pricey side
a little goes a fairly long way as well.
it easily removed all of my makeup without much effort
other than that i love it.
a little goes a long way
it is a little pricey
a little goes a long way
this one just leaves it so smooth
a little goes a long way
it goes on so smooth
a little definitely goes a long way.
works well , still leaves somemascara though .
didn't do much for improving my skin
very little goes a long way.
you don't even have to rub that hard or use that much
i love this product so much!
this even takes off my too faced better than sex mascara with no problem
my face was more plump
it does take more effort than my regular st
my skin looks better now at 46 than it ever has.
a little goes a long way
so this lasts for quite a long time
effective for any kind of hard to get off makeup you will ever use
difficult road to get to this point
it makes my face looks even more flawless
goes well under makeup or even alone for those no- makeup days
i love this primer so much.
reminds of the hourglass primer but better!
it goes on a little white
i like the fact it has just a tiny bit mor of a silicon feel
a little bit thicker in a good way
i've had dark circles for as long as i can remember
a little goes a long way so this jar will last a while
wanted to take better care of my skin
let's be real i'm not getting any younger.
a little goes a long way
a little product every night goes a long way.
since it's a little thicker
i've had dark circles pretty much since i was 14.
i tried so many
those hangover bags are far less than they are usually
i've really liked it thus far
what amazed me is how much smoother this made my eyelids
i've always struggled with dark circles
i would normally never spend so much for the full size
im beginning to prefer to go out make up free now that my face looks so much brighter
makes the under eye look a little less dark
plus a little goes a long way
the color is a little better the crow's feet aren't as bad
see how much better it can get
which go a long way
wayyyy better than bobbi brown's eye cream!
it also made my under eye circles so much lighter
so far i actually really like it
i know it is a bit pricey
a little goes a long way
my eyes look a lot better lately.
my make up removing routine is now much more gentle
this really does help them appear a bit lighter
i've probably tried a good 30+ eye creams over the years
i love this product so much!
my under eyes seem less creapy
i don't have too much of dark circle
plus a little goes a long way so the price is justified
the skin tone under my eyes seems more even
it has really given my face a fuller
it is not too heavy
even after long nights with very little sleep
also a little goes a long run
i've seen a lot of creams make a lot of lofty promises
tried better, tried worse.
after using this product for 10 days my under eyes are definitely brighter
think about what i had been doing differently
perhaps that will come after i use it longer
hope for more improvement
it feels more like a gel going on
so far i love it
my concealer goes on much better
with this cream, very little goes a long way.
this has made them less dark
more importantly it actually helped reduce that deep set appearance
this one is way better.
i feel like i have to use more than the other
this is the much more lux product indeed.
it is really thick that a small amount goes a long way
i only use it about a week now so all i can say is it makes my under eye way less dry
confidence in a cream is meant for more mature skin
a little goes a long way
on my forehead have gotten so much smaller
i like it very much.
it feels much lighter on than the consistency would lead you to believe
i've struggled for years to find a moisturizer that actually gets into the skin
it did feel on the heavier side
this cream is a little heavier
my makeup has never gone on smoother.
my skin has never looked better
it seemed to be settling in quite nicely
is also $10 less than that one
it is a little pricey at $48
a little brighter no dark spots
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way
they've definitely lightened since using this cream
this has improved it so much with just three days of using it
as i could tell it was thicker
as summer is coming that can be quite heavy
my skin feels so much better in the morning
however i just wish it came in a tube rather than a jar
so far, so good.
a little goes a long way.
makeup goes on better
no breakouts thus far
i put it on heavier at night
i love it so much.
you just need to use a little tiny bit at a time so that also makes this a great value
it operates better than some of the more expensive creams on the market
i love this cream so much.
decided it was time to start taking better care of my skin
love this moisturizer so much, use day and night.
none of which seem to last
my skin is so much softer
the little lines that used to stay behind?
results are just as good as more expensive br
haven't found anything better.
a little goes a long way
s down the most hydrated cream that i have used so far
my skin is so much softer
my skin is brighter and the texture is so even.
initially i was really hesitant to continue with this cream as it is a heavier product
more than anything i've ever used
my skin is much calmer
my skin is so much clearer
so far so good- i'm still breaking out
my makeup is so much smoother all over my trouble areas
especially considering a little bit of it is all you need to reap the benefits
oh, and a little goes a long way.
if you put on too much though
this helps quite a bit with both those issues
a little goes a long way
a little bit does go a long way
my complexion is also a lot brighter as well.
after spending so much money on others
my skin in my teens was normal with the usual acne here
i do see what some people complain about it being too thick to be able to smooth across your face
so far that i've read the only difference is a few ingredients
as far as how it feels under makeup
not so much for hydration
it could use a nicer prettier packaging
it might cost a lot
a little goes a long ways
less it more or it will grease up doing the day
this cream has really changed my skin game no more peeling
overall my skin has way better tone
only downside is it's a little pricey for how long it lasts
just wish it had more i. the tube!!
a little goes a long way, so use it sparingly.
i rated 4 stars instead of 5 because of the price because i seem to be going through it rather quickly using it night
was a little nervous to try this one because i breakout so easily when i change up skin care so naturally i made my husb
so i tried it and i'm obsessed too!
yes it is definitely expensive at $48
it was a little difficult to shell out $48
i will use the second a little more sparingly to see if i can make it last a little longer
t's easier to get every last bit of it out
good for my slightly red skin.
it actually faded some really stubborn acne scars as well
perhaps 3-4 times a day often as a makeup primer before my foundation
the smell can be a little off putting
on occasion under makeup for more dewiness
saves way more than just our fingers pressing this tube
trying out thus one just to see the difference between the ceramidin cream
stay away from too much fragrance or oils
yo our surprise this cream works so much better then prescription ever did
because i think the price is still too high
this runs out waaaay too fast
i love this product so much
when i wake up in the morning my skin looks so much healthier
my skin has changed so much since
although i haven't been using this for very long
which gets much worse during the winter months
products geared towards that type seemed to just make my skin worse
i like it even better than the ceramidin.
a little goes a long way.
you only need a little bit
next morning my face looked much more even toned with less redness
overall felt much smoother than the day before
so far so amazing
in the morning it felt 100% better
so minus one for that.
gave 4 stars because it's way too expensive!
it's just a little thicker i think
my skin is much less red
i won't because i'll probably break out more
a little product goes a long way
if a product can do that much good my face after one night
the only down fall is that i personally think that this is a nighttime only product for the mere reason that it is a little too thick to put makeup on top of
because it has helped my skin so much i deal with that
as well as the wounds has healed much quicker
my skin is looking more clear than ever
things have never been easier to do my makeup
i usually don't break out that much
the cream however is on the heavier side which i was worried about
so long story short
a little goes a long way though.
i've noticed my face gets a little more oily throughout the day now
a little bit goes a long way
so a little bit goes a long way
it does so much
i noticed that a little bit goes a long way so the jar would end up lasting a longg time
would be much more of a challenge
if i wanted more coverage
even better than the primer i had been using
i no longer have to wear foundation
i wish that they would come out with a different color so that people with darker skin can enjoy it as well
if i use too much of this
my first time using this i put too much on
as you can imagine over 30 years that is a lot of money
a little goes a long way
so even though the jar is expensive
need more sleep than makeup lately
it isn't thick and a little goes a long way.
yes, it's expensive but you only need a little.
a little goes a long way
by the end of the day my face was much more oily than it normally would be
it is a great primer i've tried other correctors that are just too green
i don't wear much makeup-- if any-- on most days
a little goes a long way
i love that this has an spf too.
after my usual cleansing i applied a decent amount as suggested
it's almost too much for me on a day to day basis now
haven't completely road tested as far as staying power
super light weight & a little goes a long way.
it does help quite a bit
a little definitely goes a long way
a bit goes a long way for this cream!
not much red coverage
i get more compliments now without wearing makeup
i don't even need foundation most days
this product would still be good
maybe one more shade but that's pushing it.
just a little does go a long way.
i will definitely buy the bigger one
have always struggled to keep it balanced
this product feels a little heavy for my skin type
that was too much for me personally
it does wash me out slightly
am not sure how/if this would work for deeper skin tones
though it me a little bit to figure out the right amount to put on
i figured out a little goes a long way
a little bit goes such a long way
it comes out a little too pale to wear without something on top
a little goes a long way so a jar will last awhile making it well worth the cost
i put too much
that seems to work out more for me
a little goes a long way
however the reason i love this product so much is because it help reduce the pores
or juice beauty work well for my skin anyway as far as moisture needs go
this goes on much smoother
which is a lot cheaper
if anything, my skin is better.
so far so good!
my skin feels so much softer
i could not be happier!
it feels like the moisturizer is really sinking into your skin rather than settling on top
a little goes a long way
add more as needed
used way too much on the first try
i've gotten compliments that my usual acne prone skin looks good
is that only a little product goes a long way
it took me a while to determine both how much to use
since you only need a little at time
a little really does go a long way.
when i put too much it didn't blend as great
don't use too much
put on way too much it was st
i like it better than the other boscia makeup removers
it's also a little bit of extra effort than i'm used to to wash off makeup
it works on the eyes too which is a plus because i've had a hard time finding removers that work on the eyes as well
a little goes a long way literally!!!
so far so good
this is better than clinique
it's a generous amount considering a little bit goes a long way
i like it much better
i love how much neater it is compared to a liquid oil cleanser
still picked up a little bit
this takes it off quite easily
it makes my skin look better
i hate the feeling of putting more "oil" on it
this just makes it a ton easier
will definitely get more
this is not bad, and slightly cheaper.
it's way easier than my typical routine
this works way better than any wipe i have ever used
takes a bit more work than most other cleansing balms to get to work
so far i am loving it
i could not be happier with it
with so little effort
which made the next step to my skin routine much easier
much ... this gets a a from me
little bit to spread it all over the face
it's much easier to spread
i felt like i had to use more than i would have wanted to
a little goes a very long way.
'm back for more
so far this has worked on both my oily
i love this product so much!
better than typical face wash
it actually ecourages a little water to really emusify it
a little goes a long way too.
i end up with more problems
i love this product so much
love this so much!
i like the boscia a bit better because it removes long wear
it seems like nothing makes it better
saved me so much money.
my skin has never looked better
this has helped so much
this is a far more intensive method but works!
my makeup has never gone on so smooth ever!
2 pumps is more than enough
works way better than the normal masks.
i love this product better than tsubaki beauty oil
but, my hands love it more!
i also don't have to use too much in comparison to the serum
haven't used long enough to see lift
a little goes a long way too.
helps it to heal much quicker than it normally would
i find my skin much smoother
a little goes a long way
a little does goes a long way.
a little goes a long way
the a little goes a very long way
my face looks much less dull
are already much much much smoother
just a little bit goes a long way
so less than half the price that sells here
except that this feels 3x heavier
it might be too heavy for use when it gets warmer
a little bit goes a long way
it does make me look few younger!
my skin looked better than it had in months
for what it does, i would even pay more.
so far it seems to be working
so far, i'm sold on this.
at first i used too much
have been loving the results so far
the first couple days i think i applied too much.
a little definitely goes a long way.
my skin has never looked better
prep it so well for makeup
also, a little goes a long way.
i appreciate that a little product goes a long way
most importantly it has helped clear my eyelid eczema much faster than any other skin product
could not be happier
a little bit goes a long way
the price is a bit more than what i would normally pay
rarely do find products that love my skin as much as i do
a little goes a long way.
the motivation behind the product is even better
it takes a little time to see results
if you use too much
i came on here to check how much it costs
because more likely than not it's been sitting out on the shelf a lot longer than it should
hope to see more from this br
i guess it can feel a little heavy if you put too much on
give it 4 stars because its quite expensive
as far as the scent
it was thicker than i expected
my skin has never looked better
ever since i start using this product i have gotten so much compliments on my skin
it goes on so smooth
even though i have ''aging'' skin
it only takes a little bit
a little goes a long way
this is even better
this is so much easier to apply
a little bit does the trick
you can use it pretty much anywhere
a little bit goes a long way with this melt!
giving me a more smooth
then the product goes on making you look a little 'slick'
plus a little goes a long way!
pores definitely look smaller, too.
a little goes a long way so great value based on how little i need to use
was a bit hesitant to use it since my face can break out so easily
it did make it feel much better
caution, a little goes a long way.
moisturizes much better than an oil
might be too much
a little bit goes a long way
lasts quite a long time
a little goes a long way!
so don't be discouraged that the bottle seems a bit small
a little goes a long way
a nice opinion if you don't mind spending more on something reliable
a little goes a long way
pretty much right away
i wanted to invest in a more expensive eye cream because i don't want these lines to get worse
giving you a brighter look
but certainly reduce the lines.
a little bit goes a long way for this product so this will last forever
it just makes my skin feel so much better
much like her other products
i am seeing results faster
results matter more than smell as i get older
my skin has never looked better when i wake up.
my complexion looks more even
my complexion looks a lot more even
the skin gets better the more i use it
my skin looks so much lighter
i love this moisturizer so much
my skin is not as red any more
my skin is so much better
loving it so far!
you don't even need a whole pump of the oil so try using as little as possible to start
so naturally i had to try this product
feels even better on my skin once i've washed everything off
makes the process so much easier
my skin has been a little is drier than it used to be
hope for more improvements in my skin
smooth for a really long time after use
my skin has never looked better
have tried so many different creams
i will be defintiely getting more!
i wake up with much better skin
i would recommend it to people who need a little more moisture or a thicker face cream
it even works well if putting on
it made everything else look better than ever
a little goes a long way
too much can feel heavy
so when i use this mask i have been getting progressively less
this mask does as well or better than many much more expensive competitors
feel like it'll last longer
unfortunately you can purchase elsewhere for way less
a little goes a long way
have come to realize it's much better when combined win another moisturizer
this is helping it quite a bit
such a bummer because it could have last a lot longer than it did
i love this one so much
will definitely be buying more from the br
the older i got the worse i got the more sensitive my face got
i love this product so much i've been sharing it with my friends
enjoy the product just as much as i do
i felt like it was too pricy for my budget
great for heavier makeup days
a little bit goes a long way
leaves my skin feeling softer than it's felt in years
i am glad i tried this more trial size before spending alot of money
a little goes a long way
even though it is oil
my face does look brighter afterwards
so far i love all the items in this set
i love this product so much
also to add to my daycream throughout the day if i need a bit more hydration
i love this oil so much!
price wise is good too since i know it will last long time
it was definelty too much
my laugh lines looked deeper
still feel a little bit of oil
much smoother than the day before
inevitably we all will look older
it will work for you too
a little goes a long way
my skin has been improved so much
my skin is so much smoother.
the moisturizer goes on so much smoother now.
makes applying makeup so much easier in the winter too
it was so much more smooth
it actually balanced my skin
this helped so much
this is just too much
a little goes a long way
it feels slightly heavy when you initially put on
my skin has never looked better
it seems like it would be heavy
so you only need a minimal amount for your whole face/neck area
you use very little
might feel a bit heavy
i still love it nonetheless as my face looks
so far, so good.
more to the point where i can't wear much
didn't expect much more than moisture
it take times to sink in your skin this is why it's better for the night time
i love that a little goes along way
a little goes a long way
which i haven't had my skin look this healthy in a long time
my pores are much clearer
my skin also feels a lot smoother!
so far so good!
ill most definitely be buying the full size even though its pricey because nothing works for my skin
a little bit goes a long way
a little does go a long way
my face has never looked better!
my skin looks better and is less congested.
a little lasts quite a while
my pores seemed so much smaller
i will definitely be looking more into these products
its more a luxiourious feel with more of a gaurentee that this will get the job done
the taste was still very much there even when i tried washing my mouth out well with water
not so much of an oil
my face has never felt better.
as i feel that using both products really clean my face deeper
probably good for the summer though!
not as well in the winter
makes my pores much smaller
my face feels so fresh after using this little duo
just feels better in general
my face feels so much smoother
had pretty high expectations for it
now for the actual set i usually lean more toward acne prone skin
i loved this cleansing duo more than i expected.
my only complaint is how messy it can get
i still have more than 3/4 left
a little goes a long way
i've also haven't been breaking out as much.
lately i have been breaking out terribly
the soap is the second step which you only need a little
it was a great feeling usually with my acne that bad it stays for more than a week
a little definitely goes a long way so only later one portion of the bar
so far so good
i like the scent of the oil better then the bar
the downside is that the whole process takes a long time
probably worse than i ever have
some days i wear a lot
even as a travel set- it is a little bulky
even though i haven't been using this for long
i felt like it left a little residue
my skin has never felt better!
the product seemed to have a lot of oils in it
seems to have prevented me from getting any more
i like the oil more than the bar soap
so far i like it
i wouldn't say softer or tighter
my skin has never felt better.
i often poured too much
a pump or squeeze dispenser might work better to get just the right amount
the only thing that was tricky was not dumping too much oil into my h
never thought i might need more hydration
the bottle dispenses way too much product
it gave my skin way more moisture than i was expecting
if anything my skin feels ten times better than it normally does
so for me its just too many steps for an every day routine
it also left it feeling so smooth
i will definitely be getting more of these products
a bar soap to work as a team to better my skin
i couldn't be happier with the results
this cleansing system takes my makeup off better than anything else
a little goes a long way
i only wish that there was a pump on the oil to control how much product comes out- i feel like i end up using too much/wasting it some days
i do tend to have a combination skin type so this might have been just a bit heavy
looked better after just a few uses
i will definitely be using it often
it does very little to remove makeup
the oil was a litt hard to use since it has an open top that screws off so you have to be careful not to pour too much out
thought it would add too much time to my routine in the morning
my skin feels so much better
my skin is now so much clearer.
i've poured on more than needed
i am loving this system so far!
i oil that the oil is thicker than others that i have
i feel that it moisturizes my skin much better than most
rather than that too tight feeling
so far i really like this.
my skin has improved so much
more than what i was expecting.
a little more work since it is a two step process
it also works great to break my makeup up at the end of the day which i love it makes my routine much more simple
my skin has improved so much
it's made my skin feel so much smoother
would put my money on the little packet of refreshing oil though
more refreshed than ever
not only does my skin feel so much more hydrated
it's also great because it comes with both a bar soap as well as a cleansing oil so you can use both or one or the other depending on how much time you have
the application was a little messy i guess.
i wish it was a little bit more cheaper
i travel so much
my skin could not be more revitalize thanks to this
i tend to stay away from products that contain oil because i pretty much have combination skin
i love these two products so far.
so overall, love it!
far more than my typical mycellar water routine
make my situation worse
i think i've wasted most of it just cause it goes every where
it works so well
it seems to work just as well
my skin was softer than usual in the morning
i couldn't be happier with the products
this travel set is a great way to give it a shot without investing too much at first
so far my skin has been feeling great!
i am in love with this product so far.
it's now much more soft
the first thing i noticed is that my skin has gotten much softer
so far so good
it seems to be working pretty good so far
so far i like it
my skin seems brighter and firmer as well.
my skin is softer than every !
it even made my skin look a little lighter .
makes my skin worse
have helped thus far with the breakouts
so far it has not caused any breakout issues
skin looks more even in tone
this one does smell better than the feeling rosy one
after one use of this product i could no longer see my pores
let it sit for about 30 seconds for a thicker consistency to make application easier
a little goes a long way
as far as price point
it gives you quite a bit more product than most other eye creams at a comparable price
i still have a good amount.
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way!
it goes on so smooth
a little bit goes a long way
much faster than other creams i've tried before
they can help things a bit though.
it was too pricey for me for only
you get more for your money
tend to not get as much sleep as i should
a little goes a long way
you get a lot for your money too!
a tiny bit goes a really long way
while i still have some more darkness to reduce
so i have tried so many eye creams.
you get a lot for the money compared to other eye creams
it goes on so well & a little goes a long way.
a little goes a long way
plus a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way!!
my concealer has never looked better
have tried every eye cream in sephora so far
little goes a long way.
my skin tone seems more even
you only need a little bit to apply to your whole face
it takes very little to cover my face so a bottle will last quite some time
they're significantly less deep
because i felt like that was a little too heavy
i'd seen it on a breakdown of good skin care somewhere
i think i need to use it a little longer
can only hope it will last long enough to make the cost of the product less biting
anything more than that will be way to much.
i used it when i wasn't quite in need of this much hydration
i tried so many things: eucerin
still works with just a primer
it does have a bit of a thicker consistency
a little goes a long way
a bit more like honey really
often mix a tiny bit with cream products to make them a bit more sheer
wish it had a little more stronger honey scent
like most of the rest of the farmacy line
love it so far!
while it's initially a little greasy it soaks in relatively quickly
my skin is 1000x better
so far- they make amazing
i wake up with a healthy glow i no longer feel like i need foundation if i'm stepping out to run a quick err
a little bit of this product together for my h
i can already tell my skin is becoming less irritated
loving it so far.
don't make it worse
my skin is so much better
the thick consistency still has me a bit hesitant to replace it with my primary moisturizer
my real serious only problem is that is doesn't come bigger
i put too much on my face
a little goes a long way
this helps when i cheat a little bit
so far i think i like it
it can be helped by adding a little less water to the powder than recommended
it's much more subtle when used this way
looking so much better than it did before i started using it
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way
feel that the people who are complaining about too much sparkle are using too much product
sometimes i use it all over when i want my skin to look brighter
it works better than my it cosmetics primer
i feel this is more of a summer look as its rather dewy
a little bit goes a long way
how much my skin was glowing
it has actually made my makeup look so much better
it is much better than highlighting powders.
so a little goes a long way
i'd definitely say this is better for combo normal
maybe because of my darker skin tone
at first was like ooo too much
would of given 5 stars if it was a tad less glittery
i mean is there anything more perfect than the baby that those two create <3 i use it daily now
which i actually happened to love more than i expected to
i made my little sample last 3 different uses because a little goes a long way
i used it before applying my full face which made the shimmer much more subtle that it already was
a little goes a long way
okay so a lot of reviews are saying that this moisturizer has too much glitter
i think they tried a little too hard making this "multi-use"
more glitter the better!
just a little will do the trick!
i love this so much
a little goes a long way.
i wasn't expecting too much highlight or moisture
the only thing i can think of is that maybe they have darker skin
was a little nervous because a lot of people reviewed it as too glittery
i wish it was a little more hydrating
a little goes a long way
i still need to give it a bit more time to see if it reduced the darkness
it's pricy however a little goes a very long way
little pricey but it actually works!!!
again its perfect it does so much
let me say a little goes a very long way so even the sample has lasted me a while
makes me look much more awake
it makes my makeup go on smoother as well.
this is just a bit too heavy for me to use
as well as plumper
i also notice a much brighter
i just wish it was a little more affordable
i loved the way it brightened my under eye area so much
i loved the way it brightened my under eye area so much
i loveee this eye cream so much!
i do need to do eye masks still since it absorbs so quickly
maybe with more time i would see more of s difference in my dark circles or fine lines?
i liked it even more than the last
it makes your eyes look a lot brighter!
you only need a little.
it goes on so smooth
give me a more fresh
it makes me feel so much better about waking up a million times during the night with my baby
it is a little pricey
it even made my skin seem brighter
a little goes a long way with this product
a little goes a long way
it made my skin appear so much lighter.
i did not notice much brightening
maybe if i use it for a longer period of time i will be able to see a bigger difference
i look forward to trying it longer to see more results
and a little goes a long way!
after getting a little too much sun
a little goes a long way
at first i was skeptical because the consistency is much lighter
i love this moisturizer so much i'll be sticking with it for a while
you only need a little bit
much friendlier on my wallet
each morning my skin feels a little tighter
was worried once my skin went back to normal i'd be much too oily
a little goes a long way i've been using well over a month maybe even 2
i still have so much in the jar
makes me more at peace with the changes that come as one approaches 40
this one is just as good- can be used as over night mask as well
slightly greasy if you put on too much
a tad expensive though smells good
so far this is the clear winner.
i would prefer it in a tube format though to make life easier
just wish it cost about $30 less.
was a little hesitant about buying this because it is expensive
i do think this product is a little over priced
a little bit goes a long way with this stuff
brightens my skin better than anything else out there
love it so much!
i fell in love deeper.
so while it is on the spendy side
it'll last for a good long while
i think it works better then any primer i've used so far
i've pretty much used them all
my make-up has never lasted so long looking this good
so expensive but love it.
it absorbs fast, a little goes a long way.
for the price, i guess i just expected more.
not as much as the other lines
a little goes a long way
have seen much better results with this
my face has never felt more smooth or healthy
too bad it's so expensive.
and it was more of a primer consistency.
the skin around my eyes looks much less crepe-y in less than a week
sadly it's a bit too far out of my comfort zone
although i feel a bit more tightness than i do with my typical heavy-duty winter moisturizer
if you're on the drier side you would probably need something extra
it really is a 5-star product as far as efficacy
most people complain becuase they are using too much of the product
my skin keeps looking better each day
so much so that i've been using less makeup.
a lot goes a long way so you don't need that much
i still have a little left
one pump is all you need-- anything more you will be sticky for a little bit
my acne scars are much lighter,almost gone.
a little stick at first
my skin was definitely more even
it felt more plump & helped with fine lines.
i've since purchased a bottle to continue using it because i liked it so much
also makes the foundation last longer for me!
but this little gem is a winner.
warning: anyone with less than dry skin will likely find this to be too much glow
smaller than i thought it would be
a little goes a long way
feels even better on
it also does what even the most expensive primer hasn't been able to do
i love this more than i expected!
it works well for now
this seemed to only make it worse
my makeup goes on much better with any other primer i have used
i mix a little in
balanced everything out so well
a little bit goes a long
long way-if you apply too much it can take a while to sink in
in a way i wish it was less dewy because it makes my foundation kind of sticky rather than smooth
a little goes along way!
end up producing far too much oil
this happens even more if use products that are too mattifying
i think a better title for this product is probably "priming
a little goes a long way
this is definitely much better than both in terms of a moisturizer/primer combo
while those may give a more flawless finish they kind gave a slick feeling
this isn't a traditional primer because i found it much thicker
it takes a longer time to settle in than a traditional primer
this helps my makeup last longer
i've never found anything better for it
a little bit goes a long way
sometimes it still needs a little "boost
this is my first review for pretty much any product
it is much-deserved
this has just as much glow as the becca one
for $10 less than my becca one
they have worked far better than any number of br
my skin has honestly never looked clearer since using this product
only downfall to this is the size of bottle i would love a bigger bottle so this can last me even longer
it helped sooo much
works just as well as bioderma
smells so much better
i'd rather just pay more for a bigger bottle
more so than an actual eye makeup remover
while a little bit goes a long way
a little bit goes a long way!
i hope sephora begins making these in bigger bottles
wish that they came in bigger bottles!
however it's less than $10
this had no irritation what so ever
i love the charcoal one so far
t might be better for the summer
when i have more oil --
i wish there was a bigger one for home
i just wish there was a bigger bottle!!
i wish it was a bit bigger for the price since it is a sephora br
i hope i like it as much or even more than the rose
i overdid it a little with retin-a
it is much more affordable
i just wish you could buy a bigger amount
as much as i love this product
also doesnt seem to be doing anything else than leaving the skin soft
making the price too much
i've had a much lesser amount of breakouts
the more of it you use the better
i've noticed that foundation applies so much better when i use this product
it is more of a serum so you may need something else
actually had a lot of expectations on this product
your face will become brighter than usual.
doesn't make my face gone more sensitive which a lot of other makeup products do
works really well if you have uneven skin tone.
t's pretty concentrated so a little goes a long way :
made another worse in the process
i looked significantly better to the point when my husb
are less so too
just generally looks better the next morning
my skin always looks much better in the morning.
this product works much better if you leave it on over night as a sleeping mask or even as a night cream
leaves my skin softer than anything else i've ever tried
after 3 days of using it in a row my skin looked so much better
this is much different
it was enough to use more than five times
felt my foundation on way smoother
i am no longer flaky
my flare up was pretty much reduced
other few areas too
trust me i've gone through more than a few moisturizers trying to find the right fit
a little goes a long way!
it is too early for me to see long-term benefits
certainly in the short term this does sooth
it will probably be too much for you
they don't show as much
smoother then it's been in a long time
no idea if you go straight to something thicker
you are getting very little product for the price
i don't tend to wear too much makeup during the week
a little goes a long way.
makes my skin more even
help your makeup last longer
it makes my makeup last so much longer
i gave it 4 stars only because the price is a little high $$$
i love the smell too even though many people say it is over powering i just feel fresh when i have it on
my makeup significantly lasts longer.
i've tried so many things out there
was super sketch to exchange it out for this one because it's a little more expensive
at first i was hesitant bc the price is higher than i wanted to spend
this product does take a little longer than i expected to dry
love this so much!
a little bit goes a long way
this gives me so much moisture
a little goes along way for sure.
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way
felt better about making a big purchase with this one
a little goes a long way.
does work much longer than most moisturizers
for $52 i expect much more from a cream
i like this much better than the drunk elephant moisturizer
this has so helped to even out my face!
also has better skin ingredients
you only get a little bit of product for the amount of money you pay
a little goes a long way
my skin looks better than it has in 5 years which says a lot considering i'm only 28
a little definitely goes a long way
i actually like it better
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long ways
i definitely think there are cheaper options out there that work very similar or just as good
a little bit goes a long way.
a little goes a long way.
i quickly discovered that a little goes a very long way
its a little expensive but it does not take much.
each morning it was even better.
a little bit goes a long way
feel so much softer
because it works so well
enough for my neck too
learning a lot as fast as i can
i wouldn't give it 5 stars just yet because it is on the more expensive side
or less on lighter days when you need less moisture
has been getting more
i only say "unfortunately" because the price is a bit higher then i'd like to pay for a moisturizer
a little goes a long way
as far as texture
i do think it should be priced cheaper than a typical foundation though
if you're on the lighter side
my makeup stayed in place better than with my usual primer
what i love about this product more than the blurring effect is that it really does even your skin tone
as it seems normal
looks flawless with little no effort
because it still did a better job than my other pore refining primers
maybe even a transparent option?
even with significant blending it was still slightly too dark for my very fair skin
if this product came in a lighter shade i would absolutely buy it
lately i've been getting a lot more blackheads at age 39
a little bit goes a long way
it looks darker than it goes on.
a little goes a long way
i wasn't expecting anything more than the average night cream
my skin definitely feels more plump when i wake up as well as throughout the day
found that it does remove even well-set product a bit
after a week i hardly needed any foundation
there is plenty of product
so far it's been working well
i do like it so far
it doesn't last very long for as much as it costs
more than i should for sure
stays truly matte even after a long work day
it works so well
even after a full day of classes on campus i was a lot less oily than normal
the directions do say to dab as little product as possible
i will say that a little goes a lot way
my light makeup starts to feel heavier
this keeps me matte for hours longer
otherwise, great product so far.
i also like using it more than a typical powder.
using a mattefying primer in the morning always leaves my skin a little tight
there is not very much product in here for the price
it is so much more effective than the finishing powders
i love this stuff so far.
it helps control that a little more
its been months of being discouraged because i love makeup so much
this may be a bit premature
she says it makes it feel so much better!
i love it so much.
it otherwise works well though
adding a little more water was great for less exfoliation
found it to be a little too messy
i've got a lot of product left because a little goes a long way for the way i use it
a little goes a long way!
it has only made it better
none have helped even close to the way this has
other times not so much
my pores look much better
probably more than a year
i've struggled a lot more with my acne
the plus with it being a powder is that it lasts so long
after trying so many products
with a little help from my usual primer
you can actually feel how much cleaner your skin is after the first use
my pores have never looked better
$80 is a lot for a mask
worse comes to worse, you'll have to return it.
after just one use my skin is softer than its ever been in my whole life
you use sooo much less product
i bet this would last 3x longer than most of theirs
probably too much we had our own spa night
for how little you need to use
my skin tone is more even
it does burn a little bit
it is a little pricey
my skin is so even
a little goes a long way
my skin has never looked better
i started to see more results
it stops the breakout from getting worse
it looked a lot clearer
it might see pricey
you don't use very much
a lot of expensive products make big claims
once per week was proving too much exfoliation for me
it was better than my purchase of rodan
so far, so good.
my skin gotten so much better
in more places then others
certainly more than just a tingle
may buy this too
went back to better than normal
why must it be so expensive though!
a little goes a long way
my skin looks even better a day or 2 after i use it
this burns a little bit
it is looking a little smoother
i think the first time i used this mask my face had to much dead skin to really penetrate
love it so much!
i suggest not rubbing it in so much when applying it
that's more than enough
no more break outs
my tone is even
my skin looks better and feels better!
it says not to use it more than once per week
my pores seem to have gotten larger looking as i've aged
with much shorter term results
my texture had become so much better
it is expensive but it does work.
i leave it on for longer than they say
in just 3 uses my skin looks 100 times better.
cannot stress how much of a difference this has made on my skin
my skin has gotten so much clearer
my skin is looking better since i have started using it
it just keeps getting better
i can't wait to see how much more this product will transform my skin as i continue to use it
well now my scars
it tingled a little bit the first time i used it
my skin was a little brighter
has improved my skin in ways i thought never possible
it does sting/burn a little bit when first applied
it stings a little initially
so far they work well together
as if it couldn't get better
it tingles a little at the beginning
i needed less makeup too.
say how much exaggerated these claims are
with very little improvement
in 20 minutes!yes, it is expensive!
while i wish it were less expensive
my skin looked better
my skin got better looking each day
maybe tingle is the better word
a bit brighter after each use
the fact that i like this so much :
i just love this whole line so much
i did get a little red
they appear much smaller
felt much like any other light peel or mask with the difference of this actually delivering very powerful effects
cannot wait to see how this works after a few more uses
this made me feel so much better about my skin!
the next week the pimples were like small bumps not hurting any more
it was too much for my skin
my skin looks much better
it would be too heavy
my makeup looks way better
i've liked this product so much
i would prefer more cream/less gel
it lasts me much much longer
some way more expensive than this one
so much so that people commented on the difference
my skin has become clearer than it's ever been
my skin feels better than ever before
applied a little bit more of this moisturizer
maybe i should've left it on longer
also, a little goes a long way.
my skin looks better than ever
a little goes a long way!
the line seems more natural than other lines which is why i do like the br
it's possible this product may be better for the older women like me
i love this product so much
it just is too intense for me during application
ever since moving to a warmer climate
my skin feels so much better.
so far so good this has not broke me out
even the redness now looks more like a light flush
my skin has never looked better.
as much as i love the original
every oil i've used has left my skin still wanting more
believe it much more moitsurizing than the original
i think people find it annoying that it's so much more expensive than the original
much better than original.
on my aged combination skin it seems to sink in better
it simply makes any of my products better.
somehow it feels richer
the regular oil although it did make my face feel softer than the regular oil
this is one of the better ones
the packaging does make it difficult to see how much you have left
a little goes a long way
which a little goes a long way
goes on thick so very little product is needed
however it smells so nice you end up putting on much more than necessary
i still like it
after a week of using this i really couldn't believe how it had changed my skin for the better
at first i thought the cream might be too heavy for me
although it is definitely on the pricier side
a little goes a very long way
about since it tends to be a little thicker
so far i'm preferring sunday riley's "tidal" for that purpose so much more
a little goes a long way
i definitely have spent way more than that trying to find a drugstore version that works
a little goes a long way!
was looking a little dull
than this is the one for you
a little goes a long way because it is thicker
a little goes a long way
it's a little on the thicker side
no more than that or it will feel super heavy on
a little goes a long way
it a heavier cream that i would normally be hesitant to use
so far, i think this product is ok.
a little goes a long way with both of these products
i think the secret to this product is using a lot less than you think
this has only helped to allow my skin to look even better
it even looked better
i couldn't be happier
was using more than i should have just to get that moisturized feeling
a little bit goes a long way
even though it seem to help somewhat
also super hydrating… i feel like my skin is noticeably more glory
a little goes a long way
looks so much more even
my skin has never looked better
someone who isn't will see this last quite a bit longer
my makeup sits better and lasts longer.
even though i'm still using the acne
although many people are okay with it
i don't see as much progress
sometimes at night as well
more difficult to rub in
my skin texture has improved so much since i started using this both day
i started liking my face more without foundation than with it
i still have some left from the sample size since a little really goes a long way
my skin just looks better
a little does go a long way
if some spots on my face still felt dry i would add a little more
so use a little bit at a time
over this past week it has become a lot softer
i no longer splurge on ysl foundation as i don't need it
just a little dab goes a long way
i only use a little and only where needed.
applying too much product
my facehas never felt softer or smoother.
actually seems to be helping
i love it just as much
i love that it comes in a tube rather than
this not going to last very long compared to my other cleansers
it has dozens of little uses that add up to a sexier
this one works just as well
i've gotten to try a lot of products
this cleanser does the job with a little bit of product
a little goes a loooooooong way
feeling better ever since i started using it
my skin has improved quite a bit
for so long it was either use a product that was calming
i've gone through a full bottle so far
a little goes a long way
so far i like it
although my face seems to be a little drier than normal
even though it's a gentle cleaner it got off all of those heavier serum's
really like it so far
as i love makeup a little too much
she said that it was probably my face wash that was drying me out so much
making it harder for my moisturizer to work
all you need is a little bit
the smell can be a little bit strong.
that was too hard on my skin to use twice a day
a little goes a very long way!
it seems to work well
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way
so far i'm really enjoying this
the product itself is so mild that i can get past that
i don't even need to use very much of it to have a completely fresh
definitely going to try out more products from this line
at a better price point
i feel much more hydration then normal
my skin is softer then it has ever been.
will definitely be trying more of their products
just feel so much better thanks to this cleanser
so far so good
not to mention the bottle is way bigger than i expected
it does that well
i wanted something that was oil free even though my skin is normal
it goes a long way
my skin tone is more even
i love this cleanser so much.
now my skin is looking even better than before.
we haaaaaavvvvveeee to moistureize now more than ever
it looks younger and more even.
they all just make it flare up more
this was simply too heavy
i couldn't recommend it more
my skin has never looked better.
a little goes a long way.
had just gotten worse with age
a little will go a long way
it makes the expensive cream last longer
i did not notice much different just slightly or hydrated
feel way healthier than before
some worked a little, most none at all.
a little goes a long way.
people, this is everything they say and more.
get as much bang for my buck
nothing has seemed to help
normal every where else
the consistency is a little different
it takes very little to cover your face- less is definitely more
after a week my face has never looked better
a little goes a long way.
my skin is much better
i don't use for my face so much i mostly use on my neck
and i'm glad how sephora carries it now!
want more on that part
so far so good.
this has given me faster results
now at 32 i get many compliments on my skin
because you use so little the jar lasts a very long time
you need very little product.
you need to use so little at a time that the cost is not all that excessive
my skin has never looked better
i can reach my vib rouge reward points even faster now that sephora carries this line
a little goes a very long way
my skin has never looked better
there is a reason it has been around as long as it has
my skin was softer than it had ever been
you only need a very little amount of this product
love the results i have seen so far
my make-up even looks better now that my skin looks
this is just like the thicker version of this cream except it glides on much more smoothly
doesnt break me out more
a little does go a long way
i've spent so much trying other moisturizers
some not so much
but lamer works every time.
they said my skin is turning much better than before
my skin hardly needs makeup it glows so much
sephora has a great return policy so there is no loss there
obviously it can get expensive
my makeup concealer looks so much better when i use this first
neither did much for my dark circles.
the cream alone was nice as far as hydration
it makes spreading the cream on after so much easier
my fine lines got worse
a little goes a long way so even though it's on the pricier side i think the tube will last a long time
maybe 8 months or so
pretty much everything out there from lines like skii
it just keeps getting better
a little goes a long way and it lathers nicely.
a little bit goes a very long way.
so far so good
a little goes a long way
a little of this goes a long way
i still have a ton of product left
sometimes just a tiny difference is enough.
my skin has never felt better
on a morning after enjoying a wee bit too much wine last night
a little goes a long way if you press it into the skin
that may be forever though because a little goes a long way
it took longer than i anticipated
my skin tone is more even with less dark patches under my eyes
even though this serum hasn't prevented all acne for me it's definitely improved it more than i've ever been able to
in which case i'm happy to spend my money on something that improves the quality of my skin over makeup that just patchily covers up the problems
my skin definitely looks much better than it used to
that was a small price to pay for how much better my skin looks now
so far it has been good
the little capsules are plenty too
even save a little for the back of my h
my skin even looked more glowing afterwards.
even slightly irritated this might be a nice option to try
it doesn't work very well as a lifting
a little goes a long way
i just wish they offered a little more of a range
a little goes a long way.
it lasts me all day too.
the only thing i do notice is that my skin seems to be alittle oilier the next morning after use
that it is not much
a little goes a long way
it really helped to get my make-up on much smoother for a flawless finish
helps give me a more flawless look
instead it just made my skin look just that much more flawless
i think if you had dry skin it might be a little much
i did notice that it could be a bit more long lasting
it did help create a more smoother looking skin
although a little on the pricey side
love this product so much!
i just wish the product lasted longer on the skin
also wish the bottle was a little bigger.
what i preferred about shiseido's ibuki smart filtering smoother is that it is a lot lighter
a little product went a loooong way.
it makes it a bit challenging to actually get the product out
this is one of those "less is more" products
i can add a tiny bit more to trouble areas that need extra blurring
a little goes a long way
like you're making it worse or moving around all your makeup
it made my makeup look so much better
i didn't notice it reduce my pores as much as i'd hoped
a little bit goes a long way!
i didnt break out from it too which is always a bonus
it made my skin look so much better
i stay significantly more matte than if i wore my nars primer alone
i guess a little does go a long way
i feel my makeup stays longer
that means fresh looks for longer time
it helped with controlling how much product you’re going to use
also love the scent as it lingers on the skin quite well
a little goes a long way
i definitely saw that my makeup lasted longer than usual
this primer mattifies it a bit
is also designed to better the skin in the long run
at this price i was hoping i'd get a little more
my foundation came out much smoother
blended into my face so much better
getting older it's gotten a little less breakout crazy
you don't need to use too much product
in fact it's so much better.
the makeup looks so even
look smoother than ever
seriously made my skin look younger
my skin looks noticeably smoother which makes my foundation look much more flawless
i noticed i was waaaaay less oilier
my makeup stayed on longer
it actually looks fresh all day
it is so light
while sometimes a product will make my pores appear a bit smaller
texture have improved with just 5 uses so far
you just need a little of it
i sometimes use it in the day too.
it's lasted quite a while as a little goes a long way
since a little goes a long way
my skin looks great--plumped, more even.
a little goes a long way--the tub is huge
my face is so smooth and so much less red.
overall it has done nothing
fine lines that are becoming more obvious as i edge closer
so far so good
i may have put on too much moisturizer.
my skin tone appeared slightly more even
a little goes a long way
a little goes longer than you would think it would
my skin feels smoother already
things just keep getting better
i just wish it was not too expansive!
for lack of a better word
my complexion has never been better.
that tugs at the skin a little too much
you get more for less money
it for every age group too
a lot thinner than most oil cleaners
my skin is so much better!!!
my skin looks better than ever
my skin looks 80% better
it does what it claims as well.
love this moisturizer so much!
a little goes a long way with this.
at a much better price
have been trying to learn how to adult better
over time theyve lightened up quite a bit
getting very little sleep
my circles are quite a bit lighter
i look like i get more rest than sleeping beauty when the truth is far far from it
it lasts so long for me.
side note- if you are a deeper skin tone
i don’t have to worry about getting too close to my lash line
this product seems to work well.
half of a pump is enough
i think it helps with the first signs of aging too
i would tell people to get more sleep
i've had chronically tired look for as long as i can remember
i actually feel a lot more energized
it is the more effective eye cream i have ever used as far as dark circles go
have been more into oils
i will likely use this mostly at night since it was slightly problematic under makeup -- for me
even worse than the breakouts are the red spots that stay on my face for months
i couldn't be happier with it.
this one works better
it lasts for a really long time
i no longer have dull
have felt so much better
i feel like it would be too much
always thought they would make my face more oily
much less acne though
i just wish they made it a bigger bottle!
however, this oil actually works.
i am loving this so far
my skin is becoming more
so you would think that an oil based moisturizer would make it worse
my skin has never looked better.
lasts a long time as well.
a little goes a long way with this product.
it also felt a little bit greasy on my face for quite awhile before fully absorbing into my skin
the pump packaging allows you to use as much or as little as you need
it does seem significantly more expensive than the other br
it makes my skin looks much healthier
a little bit goes a long way
a little bit goes a long way
wish it came in a bigger bottle!
because i have found a better one for my budget
i love this product so much!
this helps so much
it's easy to use too much
especially if i use too much
i think this oil is better than the josie maran oil
i got the travel size too
probably too heavy to use on the face in the day
my skin has never felt better
a little goes along way with this product.
if i accidentally put too much
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way.
i sweat even more
really makes a difference in a short amount of time
besides the fact it burns a little at first
i might use something a little heavier over this in winter
or if i will need something stronger
my skin is much smoother
after using this my skin is much more even
i wish i could give this product more than 5 stars
so far so good!
makeup goes on much better
chill a little bit while i wait
i love all of the skin laundry products that i have tried so far
the price is great for how much product you get
the price is also a lot steeper than i'd prefer.
as far as the "bounce" claims
i don't necessarily feel like it left my skin feeling any better than similar br
my skin feels much more resilient after using this cream
even for those of us who tend to rush around
i might use a heavier cream at night in the winter
think that my under eye area is a bit more plump in the mornings
my under eye area actually does look fresher
this line just keeps getting better
it couldn't have come at a better time because my eyes are haggard
the skin around my eyes is so much smoother
it does stop my lines from getting deeper
a little bit goes a really long way
it has helped my eye make up stay on longer than normal
i probably wouldn't pay that much for eye cream in the future
better taken care of when i use this product
i am a firm believer that keeping them away is much easier than trying to turn the clock back
makeup goes well over it
the price is up there a little
have always had trouble with dark circles
alot goes a long way
this is the right consistency for a little extra coverage during the harsh northeast winters as well
a very little goes a long way
a little goes a long way
the price may seem a little high
a tiny bit goes such a long way that i can easily see this lasting me a year or more
results: my results are a little harder to categorize because my eyes aren't really an area of concern yet
my makeup seems to go on a little smoother in the morning
after a month i do think the lines look slightly reduced
the price point of this product warrants a sturdier box
this is one of those a little goes a long way products
when you factor that in the cost is not much more than other good eye creams
given me a more youthful look
it works better than other creams i've used
this has helped my makeup go on more smoothly
i do think the price point is too high for what it is
because i have other eye creams that do the same thing for much less
this eye cream is no better or worse than many others
so far hasn't done anything for fine lines
this eye cream seems to do a little bit of everything
i love that is is not too heavy
a little goes a long way.
a little goes a long way
it is a little pricey.
my dark circles under my eyes are much lighter
a little does a long way with this product
goes on rather light
a little goes a long way!
even better i am seeing results after just 1 week
if you rub this too much
those as well get the job done
everything i put on my face made it worse
it has helped a lot
i still have enough product for one more month
my skin is so much smoother
so far so good
my face no longer looks like an oil slick!
is a great price with how much product you get
how long it lasts
it feels so good that i am tempted to wash my face with it more than once at a time
it kind of does make the skin a little bit tighter so maybe not
it does last long because you only need a little bit to wash your whole face
a little does go a long way
this product changed my skin type so much.
balanced which i love so much
also, a little goes a long way!
a little goes a long way
even without one it still works wonders
for as long as i can remember i've struggled with my skin
i can say my skin feels much more clean.
my skin definitely is more oily than anything
i find i'm so much less oily
there was so much hype about this product from the reviews
there is so much product for $30
so far so good
my skin tone has never been so even
a little bit about my skin
i would say this is more of a daytime cleanser as it makes you feel more alert
i also love that a little goes a long way.
a little bit definitely goes a long way!
it foams up really well with little product
a little goes a long way!
also, a little goes a long way.
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way.
how much product is in the tube
works so much better than clinique!!
a little goes a long way
i still have a lot to go.
this is more like a thicker cream
a little goes a long way
only reason i couldn't give it five stars was because the smell was slightly overpowering for me
it's been great so far
for sure more than 6 hours
you need very little product
at first i was a little bit skeptical since it is supposed to be for oily skin
the reason why i say this is because a little goes a long way with the cleanser
i couldn't be happier with my purchase
my skin was looking more clear
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way.
a little goes a long way
i usually use it on my lighter days when i didn't wear too much make up
i've had more breakouts than usual
a little drop of cleanser will go a very long way
a little goes a long way
the price is a little high
probably not so much for the winter as i would imagine skin would feel too dry
is a great price with how much product you get
how long it lasts
a very little amount of product is needed to give complete coverage so the price is worth it since it lasts so long
shines a little less everyday
my oils were much more under control than usual
i still have oil
i wish there was more product in the bottles so that they could last a bit longer -- i really try to stretch them out by using 2-3 pumps max
i've found that if you use more
keep my makeup in place longer
it does keep it at bay for much longer
my makeup stays in place for way longer
i love it so far!
at first i wasnt too much of a fan
the subtle sent make my morning routine just a little bit more pleasing
very easy to apply, and a little goes a long way.
not nearly as much
i stay matte/natural hours longer than i would have if i did not use this product
i only put it on my oily bits because i have found that if i put it other places i can feel it mattifying a little too much which makes me like this even more if i do say so myself
this helps it last closer to 8 hours if not more!
it only got worse
a little goes a ways with this
it did not help as much as i had hoped with my oily skin
i felt that i had to be careful of where i applied it so that the more oily parts of my face
yet depending on the season i might want something thicker
smooth longer than this guy
it's a little more pricey
so i was in the market for something not heavy.
works so much better than clinique!!
make it even oilier
other than that, amazing!
my skin has never looked better
the scent here is a little different
how easy is to work with it all days is so fresh
it has made my face look better
after i use it my face feels better
at first i was a little bit skeptical since it is supposed to be for oily skin
a little goes a long way
more even-toned since trying this product
a little goes a pretty long way
a little bit goes a long way
i do however prefer a heavier cream at night
working well so far
my acne scars have faded faster than they would have on their own naturally
not worrying about using a product that no longer has potent ingredients
i did notice my mature skin was a bit tighter
it may not be much
everything is just smoother
no problems so far
my skin is brighter and more even.
am noticing my skin looking better than ever
the more milia i was getting under my eyes
because even though it stings
it's more nurturing than i expected
so far i love this eye cream
my undereye looks better as well
a little also goes a long way because i still have a lot of product left
it does a great job so far for some of the fine lines i have around my eyes
the price point is even better to me!
its more than enough to do both eyes
as much as i'm in love with this
deeper lines are so much smoother
it works so well.
a little goes a long way
somewhat deep set under eyes from my genes/allergies/hardly ever getting sleep/life so my under eyes have been an insecurity of mine for years
it was a rather thick cream which could feel too heavy at times
i look so much healthier
my undereye area has never looked better.
this one probably isn't because i felt a little watery
i've tried quite a few other products from amore without any disappointment so decided to give this a go
at first i thought it'd be a little heavy
it absorbed pretty much instantly
helped even my makeup
a little goes a long way
i only use a little bit because it goes a long way
my skin absorbs it better when i start off with a small amount
think this could be used as a primer if you want a heavier coverage from another foundation
i actually like the perricone no foundation foundation better
may be too dark
that method is so much better
i like that it has skin care benefits too
a little goes a long way.
the jar was so much smaller than i expected it to be
it's much darker than s
for someone who wears little to no makeup each day
i've never tried hope in a jar surprisingly
i struggled with buying this because i had no clue what shade to use
a little goes a long way
the gel is completely worth the expense because a little goes a long way
because good lord is this expensive
goes a long way even if
the price may seem too much
meaning it lasts for a good amount of time
this is one of those products that less is more.
i spent so much time
my eyes looked sooooo much better after one use!
everything looks younger and firmer!
this one i liked better
neither did much for my dark circles.
'm not convinced that it's more pricey than other higher end creams that you use more of
it lasts a long while which is good as it is so expensive
i found it left too much of a residue on my skin
a little goes a long way.
i am too young to have many signs of time
even now i have no wrinkles
i do think my skin is looking better than usual
the trial size they gave us was barely filled with any product so she could barely see if it actually worked
my pores look much smaller
so far i'm in love
much more even than it previously was
i think it works well for that area too
as far as the bottle goes
or i wake with fresher
not much product at all.
its helped my dark circles a little bit
cant believe how much better my skin looks after using it for the last little bit
i can hardly believe how much better my complexion looks in two weeks of using this
a little is all you need
nothing works as well as this
you are probably applying too much
realized how much this repaired my skin
i can surely see my face became smoother
1-2 drops mixed in your foundation is more than enough otherwise it thins out your makeup too much
i don't see it making my skin feel any more oily than usual
it is on the more expensive side for an oil
sometimes you have to pay more for a better makeup product
can't live without it has helped my skin so much in many difderent ways even good for lips
this doesn't absorb as well as i was hoping
the appearance of my make up is so much smoother
mix it with pretty much anything
does not linger too much.
this is the most amazing skin care i have bought so far
the long term effects have been even better
my skin has never looked better.
i needed something to give my skin a little boost
i love this so much
a little goes a long way.
i almost think it makes my face look tighter
so far i haven't tried many others
the price isn't that bad at all compared to some elixers i've gotten for $90
i fall deeper in love with it
only a little product can be used to avoid looking like an oil stick
this oil is a must have for anyone struggling with dull spots
you can definitely justify the cost because a tiny bit goes a long way
a little goes a long way with this product
it's done a better job controlling excess oil in my t-zone than any mattefying product i've tried
i do feel that the bottle is a little on the cheap side
doesnt take hardly any because it spreads like
it helped my skin look way better
i even stopped producing as much oil throughout the day
the instagram beauty guru's use way too much in their videos
my acne scars have been fading so much more
a little goes a long way!
the more i use it the better my skin feels.
i couldn't be happier
if you use too much it can be a bit oily
looks like it has only a little product
trust me a little goes a long way
better than my kiehls midnight recovery or any more expensive oil i have
therefore they look more plump
so a little does go a long way if you are stressed about dropping so much on this
so just as many others
so far it i like it
so far, i like it.
i wasn't about to spend that much
this is my second bottle- a little goes a long way
my skin has never felt more softer
i will never switch unless getting older causes me too
my lipstick stayed on longer than usually
who really needs to spend this much on an oil??
love the product makes the application of make up much easier
i do believe that my make lasts a little longer
i love this product so much
because it makes applying my foundation better
so worth it my skin has never felt or looked better
there is nothing more i can say about it other than i love it
a little goes a long was so you will have plenty of product for a while
this actually helps a lot more than a lot of the expensive serums that i have bought in the past
work 8 hours in an area with little to no ac
my makeup has never ever looked better
i love this so much
it does a fantastic job of keeping my skin mattified for hours- more so than any other primer
i love it so much.
my makeup lasts just as long
if they work as well
it works so well
i found putting too much on didn't do anything more than using a tiny bit
it helps me maneuver the product better
this helped so much.
i am loving that my make up is staying out longer
stick so much longer without as having soo many touch ups
found my face looking more even
probably won't find anything better than this
felt so much better using this product
i think it makes my skin a bit more softer compared to just using the rose gold elixir alone
it might be a little over hyped
it's never looked better
which makes it better than most
i love it so much makes my face look so much better
has done so many wonders for my face
foundation apply so much better
i love the way this smells so much
this is soooooo much better
my skin has been changed for the better with this
this works just as well
then become even more oily if i'm not careful about what products i use
it's a little more than clinique
just a teeny amount goes a long ways
even compared to more expensive ones
wish it lasted a little longer
loved it so much
my skin is clearer and more balanced than ever!!
i wish it were less expensive
i found that they're easier
everyone needs a little farmacy in their life!
so far so good
a little goes a long way too!
i rarely review but this is so good i have to.
this has cleared a lot of little bumps
i wanted something a little more soothing
which goes a long way
but this one beats them all by far.
the full size seems to remedy that-- a little goes a long way
i love this so much.
the small tub has lasted me quite a bit of time
a little goes a long way
maybe i'm using too much product every time since they don't give a general guideline on how much product is enough
tend to get too much on my palm
gets the job done with very little product
it did a better job than my tatcha cleaning oil!!
i wish i'd get more for the price as it is expensive
it removes make up so much better then my other cleansing balm
i only used a little bit of the product
it really "melts" away makeup better than any other cleanser i've tried
i probably used more than i needed
i ask myself "does this work better than olive oil"?
i think i like this a tiny bit better!!
once you start rubbing it in a little goes a long way
took a gamble buying this because i haven't had much luck with other farmacy products
i love this so much.
i may love this even more
a little goes a long way.
smells so good and works even better!
also a little goes a long way
its a little pricey but it does work wonderfully!
i daresay this is better
more importantly, it works like a charm.
this one is so much better
you don't need nearly as much product
i definitely like this better than the makeup glide away oil pump they have
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way
on top of that i have more control over how much product i can use
its either not enough product or too much
a little goes a long way
i probably use more than i should
i like this one more
makes my skin look more even :
so far so good
it's much lighter than most oil cleansers i've used
a little goes a long way
this stuff by far is my favorite i just truly wish they made this in a larger bottle
a lot goes a long long way
i will be repurchasing it's seem to last me a long time so far
having the either be too heavy
a little goes a long way!
it is much thicker than any of the other origins moisturizers i have ever used
protect my skin a little more where i could
a little actually does go quite a long way
the rest of my makeup as usual with no issues
it does make my face a bit red though
i really like it so far after a couple of weeks
so far i love it
a drop goes a long way!
a little goes a long way
i can honestly say my skin looks better than ever
i couldn't be happier
the only time i feel it gets sticky is when i use too much product
not sticky at all which makes it better than other products
i left it on for a bit longer than recommended
it also says to leave it on for a much shorter time than most masks so great when you are in a hurry
could probably leave it on longer for more exfoliation
still have a lot to go
it might seem like a lot at first
i feel much better about my nose
could be little bit on a stronger side
you don't need much, so it lasts awhile.
i think this mask might be richer than my beloved sisley mask
but the dior is so much more affordable.
so far i love this product.
i plan to try more things from this line
works best just too pricy.
it does work well
this bottle is going to last me forever because a little goes such a long way
this was so much better
there was barely anything.
no matter how much i put on
making removing my make up actually something i look forward to rather than being a pain
have had no issues so far with this
i love it so much.
even more excited to see that it was reasonably priced
as far as skin texture it didn't work for me
but overall i like what it has done.
so far loving it
my pores look much smaller
i am hoping that with more use
leaves my skin pretty raw for a little bit after
my only problem is that i seem to be going through it a bit more than my other masks
i've tired so many masks
i've only tried it once so far
this stuff goes far
a lot of masks i use might make my skin brighter
my skin looks tighter
my skin has never looked better.
some not so much
given me even skin
for lack of a better term
even though all of their products have been good
i’ve never had better skin in my life.
my skin has never looked better.
i love this cream only use very little it does go a long way
now that they have lowered the price i'm even more in love
acne/products that strip my skin too much are my big concerns
it makes my complexion so much smoother
it still feels heavy
a little goes a long way too
i don't find that it has much of a scent at all
a little goes a long way
a little bit of this cleanser goes a long way
this is way better than purity.
be careful how much i squeeze
i love how a little bit goes a long way.
i no longer need it
you only need a little bit because it spreads quite nicely
in the summer i need something much lighter
after about a week of use the skin appears more plump
i also like that you can clearly see on the bottle how much is left
i applied way too much
this has been a life saver this summer so far
my skin had never been more plump
doesn't absorb are using too much of the product
maybe slightly more for nighttime
i've used too much before
let me just say a little goes a long way for me
but the price on this is much better as well.
initially it felt a bit watery
a little goes a long way.
my face is so much smoother after using this for only two days
this product works so well.
a little goes a long way (one pump).
not better than moisture surge
it goes on so well
my face on a whole significantly more hydrated than it's ever been
i want to try the other masks too to see if they work as well
my face did look more smooth
only giving it 4 stars because it is pretty difficult to get out of the package
this mask improved them so much
they are shrinking and so much less red.
definitely grabbing way more
overall i would probaly repurchase the mask to get a better idea
i actually left this on for longer than it asked
actually better than some facials i've had
for lack of a better term
i pretty much immediately went
the only product that i have actually seen fast results
i love this mask so much !!!!!
made it more comfortable than others
great price too compared to other face masks.
it is a bit expensive, yes.
how much it is for 1 mask
they feel so different than any other sheet mask
i've tried so many masks
stays on so much better than any other sheet mask i have tried
still have 1-2 more uses from it
the skin tone is little bit darker than my neck.
although my nails are not long by any means
this mask is a little pricey for one mask
i will be using these as much as possible because i get so many compliments on my skin
i'll definitely be buying many more of these!
so far so good
i’ve never had better skin in my life.
none have ever been as nice as this
i can feel that my skin is definitely much thinner now
you use half as much product as you would with other creams – so while this is only 1
it does say to use a pearl size amount of product so for people finding it greasy they may be using too much
unless you're a tatcha fan or you feel like more expensive stuff equals better quality then get this
a little goes a long way
my skin looks better than it ever did
became a little too slippery to h
i love it so much
a little goes a long way.
it felt heavier on my skin
my skin is so much smoother
and, a little goes a long, long, way.
her skin does look a lot fresher if that makes sense
don't have the problem any more
my skin looks better than ever
a little goes a long way!
my face has a little bit of a gloss going on
so decided to try something even lighter
and a little goes a long way!
my pores have gotten much smaller
thought i would spend this much on a moisturizer--
i only use a little bit at a time
my face has never felt better
it is on the more expensive side
you only need a little bit
some cream makes it worse
i've actually noticed that it helps keep my oils at bay longer than normal
it's a little more pricey than what i would like to spend on a moisturizer
any more than that
i love this so far.
have alot more problems than i did when i was younger as far as wrinkles
it didn't make me more oily than usual which i liked
this is amazing and a little goes a long way!
it goes a long way
my skin has never looked better
my skin has never looked better
a little goes a long way
i wanted another day time moisturizer that would sink into my skin a little more than what i have
i think it's great for summer-- would probably want something heavier for the winters in canada
there's too much to rave about
dries down quicker than anything i've used- this is 100% my new must have face cream
fyi a little goes a long way
i feel like my skin looks much better
then i realized i just put too much on
this product is the definition of "a little goes a long way"
also a little goes a long way
way less oil throughout the day
i've spent so much money trying to find a fix.
no matter how much sleep i get i always have darkness
it's expensive for how much you get
so far no luck
after i applied it i could feel the intensity so much so that it irritated my eyes
this product pills much worse than any other cream i've ever used
it looked even better
would re-purchase if it was slightly cheaper
as perricone can get a little pricey
love it as much as i do
my makeup goes on much better
her makeup looks better
she even looks more youthful
i would even say that this has made my skin smoother
my skin looks better than it has in years
it is more even clear and bright.
i love it so much!!
has been much better for me
my pores are no more
so far it has been great
i know it was a little pricey
so far pretty good!
i prefer it much more than the drunk elephant mostly because of the texture
it has truly changed my skin in less than 2 weeks
i so far like it
the bottle comes with a lot of product especially since you need less than half a pump to do its job
i think it would be too much for my skin type
which is probably more gentle anyway
it smells a little strong but it is tolerable.
it absorbs immediately, you need very little.
seems to help my makeup last longer
i feel like when i use this my makeup lasts a lot longer
works great with my primers my skin has never been better i've only had this product for 2 week
i also like how a little can go a long way
so far it's been great
much lighter than expected
feel so much softer
a little goes a long way
i somehow love this more
my skin just looks better
a little goes a long way
helped clear my skin so much that i might skip foundation from now on
i wish it was a little cheaper price wise
i just wish it was a tiny bit cheaper
a little goes a long way
my pores even look a bit smaller
it is better than any oil i've tried on my face
hope sephora starts carrying more of this line.
i love it so much
this is a little pricey
could not be happier
i no longer where makeup because my skin is glowing
i am always hesitant to put more oil on my face
a little really goes a long way!
not that much though
i read a little bit because i was skeptical we have different skin types
this has really made it look even better
i generally go through a lot of products simply because i love trying new things
so maybe different packaging
this leaves the mask feeling slightly tighter
it just feels more like a typical clay mask.
a little amount goes a long way
so far i really like this!
really like it so far
less one star for that
no matter how much i sleep
my eyes are looking 40 percent better in such a short time
have hope that with more time i will see even more positive results
my crows feet have only faded a bit so far
these 3 pricey products are still cheaper than surgery
i don't use much make up
i could have spent lots more $$$
it is really pricey compared to these
a little goes a long way with this one
they don't work as well as this
i think this formula is thicker
covers well with little effort
rather than using something that just camouflages our problematic areas
i feel like they are much softer than before
much more impressively though
i put a little bit of marula oil before
did some more research
this cream helped get rid of them better than anything else i have ever used
it hasn't reduced lines that much.
so far i really like it
i've always struggled to find a product that could reduce this
skin looks brighter and more even immediately.
sometimes its hard to take the product out
a little pricier than what i was using
a little does go a very long way which is great.
less irritated than with any other eye product i've tried
there have been lots
a little goes a long way
never feel like i'm wasting expensive product
i got this as a means to start better taking care of my skin now that i am almost 30
i wasn't expecting much from it since i've used so many different eye creams/ serums over the years
i love every product i've tried so far.
i never would have imagined myself spending so much on any product
you use so little of the product that it will last a long time
a little goes a long way
it's certainly been more effective than anything else i've yet tried at dealing with the dryness under my eyes
it's maybe also somewhat reduced how dark my undereyes look
might experiment more when i finish it
had to pump quite a few times to get enough out to do one eye
a little bit can cover both eyes
her eyes are brighter her lines are pretty much gone
i've yet to find something better.
prefer natural as it always sinks in better
your eyes reflect your life- so too much work
although i am still not sure if it tackles wrinkles any better than other creams or gels
it does last longer than i thought it would
definitely overall has made the masks more effective
i do wish it was a bit longer, like 5-10 minutes.
spots are fading too!!
like many people have said
my skin has never been better
having found that the oil cleansers do that better
i like this cleanser so much more than the de bar cleansers
it's infinitely more convenient to use
so does pretty much all of the de products i've used so far
we all pick up fragrances very differently though
i like this just as well as the pekee
i will probably use this for travel since it's a little easier to transport than the bars
as far as the formula
what's difficult or so different about that???
i do think it gets off makeup much better than the pekee bar
i actually get a bit more product for my money compared to my usual gel cleanser
my only thing is: it seems quite similar to the peekee bar
i don't find that it removes makeup any better or any worse
this is much easier
it can be a bit messy
i am okay with it so far
yes when it closes it shoots out a little bit more product
this has helped so much with this r
my sister even said my skin looked way better
my makeup usually has to be removed prior to cleansing simply because there is so much
i only have a bit left
my only complaint is that i wish it was bigger
this one just makes my skin look so much clearer
i love it so far
don't need much as a little goes a long way so make sure you apply a proper amount unlike some of the other reviewers
love it so much
so far i really like it
so far i'm loving this!
i love that a little goes a long way too.
it spreads very easily so a little goes a long way
it's hard to resist using it more than once a week
i love it so much
much quicker than 10-20 mins than the recommended
a little goes a long long way
a little goes a long way!
i think the exfoliator works a bit better than the other half
make it look even better
'd say it reduced some oil
it probably has enough for 2 masks.
it does burn a little bit on the initial application
most importantly how it makes my skin on my h
it brightened me up quite a bit
i couldn't be happier with it
i've tried so many mask
i give it four stars because $68 is a lot of money for a mask
it looked so dramatically different than my normal 'morning face' that i did a double take
already have so many positive things to say
can't wait to see how much more this mask is going to help my skin
f i used more it probably would have been even better
left it on for longer than the directions
as i have gotten older my pore have gotten wider
i do feel like my skin is clearer
so far so good
much to my sheer delight it was far better than i could have possibly imagined
the scent is a bit too strong for me.
i can definitely see myself using this long term where as baby facial is more instant
it has reduced my acne so much
its not too over-powering
it's a little less espensive than my usual boscia cleanser
4 stars instead of 5 because i do think it is a little pricey
my skin has never looked better
seems to shrink quite a bit after the first use
not sure if it dries out slightly or what
it works so well
put it into a gel formula just it can last longer
made my face feel so much smoother
i wish there was more info on how long it lasts
too pricy for what it'll last.
however you do need quite a bit of it every time
i don't think i'd use it more than once per day
effective plus it's just so much fun
however, i wish it would lather a bit more.
it seems like it will last quite some time too.
i will say that after each use i did notice my skin felt a little tight
this makes it so much
so far, so good.
makes taking my makeup off a little more exciting
a little goes along way
know i'll get more than 4 uses
and to get more than 4 uses for 10$ amazing!
know i'll get more than 4 uses out of it
you do get more uses than 4
price is right too
a little really goes a long way!
as far as the results
the wash off is easier as well.
these guys are little but they pack a big punch!
last much longer than i expected
i've only been using this for a little less than a month
i still have maybe four more uses maybe even more
you only need a little and it goes a long way.
so far only used the green one
it also left my skin a little bit more hydrated although not an extreme difference
my skin feels a lot better after using this mask 2-3x a week
so far i've only tried the green one
will be purchasing more too
it was a little hard to get off
i also really like how you can use it more than once
great for my skin that's becoming more
it seemed so extra
nothing has ever come close to what this little splash of goodness has done
seems to be working better
end note: i have found cotton balls are actually better than cotton rounds
none of them give me as fast of results as this
although it says it has only 4 uses you get much more than expected
nicely that you don't need to use much product to get full coverage
i've always been a little aprehensive of clay masks
mostly because i feel they are messy
this product is far beyond my expectations
spend far too much time online reading reviews
all year to use too
works so much better than the mask
i love how a little goes a long way.
still gives the skin what it needs
i will say: a little goes a long way!
my skin has never, ever felt softer and smoother.
little goes a long way
i may add a little more if i feel my skin is on a dry side
a little goes a long way
with this i have too
it's made my face so much brighter
have found a little goes a long way
i love this product so much.
i do think it looks better
my skin has never looked better
i can tell over time it appears more even
a little goes a long way!
didn't think there was much more to do in the way of improvement at least non-surgically
a little goes a long way
or applied too much?
anyways definitely a good buy even though the jar is smaller than i would hope for the price
could not recommend more.
do like that mask more
will try pretty much any mask at any time
perhaps apply a little bit before you go to bed
i wasn't expecting much from it since it's fairly new
just need a little and it absorbs very quickly.
this mask has many things that i like about it.
a little goes a long way
so far i really like it
looked brighter than ever
it doesn't take much since it spreads so easily
i find myself reaching for it more often than not
unlike my more expensive western counterparts
$45 is a lot for a mask
most of them are completely gone from my face in the morning -- with little or no effect on my skin
my skin look much smoother
it seem like my are better
my skin tone looks more even
as many skin care lines cost a lot more
now my skin feels much smoother
another downside is that it might be irritating my skin a little
skin tone more even
makes my skin care routine look even better
so far so good
my complexion is so much better
but this is so much better than a toner!
s for too long
more even than its ever been
if it were a little cheaper
my skin did look better afterwards
i also wish the ph were just a little lower.
for me, there are other, better options.
it’s more than 5x as expensive for a similar-ish product
so many people there
so much so that i am no longer considering fillers
my skin looks more even and has a nice texture!
i only wish they had a bigger bottle .
a little goes a long way
i need more, not less for my $.
it is a bit more plump
nothing ever comes close
my skin already looks more even
my skin looks so much better than before.
it is much smoother and firmer.
it makes my skin tone more even
works better than more expensive brands.
makes it even better
i wanted to find something to enhance my skin even more
really love it so far!
i began to feel my skin becoming firmer
it seems to work well
brighter for whole face
my skin looks much smoother
i wish the smell was a bit better than this
this one seems to deliver faster
my skin is also a lot softer as well
that's how much of a difference this product makes on my skin -- the clarity
hopefully it's helping slow down the aging process that's already started
found last time i tried to use it it gave me too much moisture
this little gem has become a staple in my regimen
so far it seems to work well.
i think it's really helped it look more even-toned
drink a lot more than i should
it seems to make my moisturizer do a better job
i've used more expensive products that doesn't even work this well
however i bit the bullet so to speak
people think i am much younger
i am finding that my skin looks better
though i needed it
we both look so much better already
makes my pores seem smaller too
my face feels and looks better.
gives my face a much smoother appearance
so far so good
its not getting any younger
my skin just keeps getting better
overall i have always looked younger than my true age
a little goes a long way!
it somehow makes my face just look better
i can tell that over all my face does look dramatically better
just has an overall younger look
my make up is going on much nicer
texture is more even
the products that i had tried just made it worse
it also made my skin look less dull
which makes it easier for me
this sample will last a while because a little goes a long way
just a bit more than a normal moisturizer
a little really goes a long way
she loves it so much
a little goes a long way.
it helps so much
very much prefer this over clinique moisture surge
t looks like you've gotten far more sleep than you actually have
it makes them smoother
i wanted something that was more long lasting
it makes more sense
a little goes a long way so even better
peeling lips that have gotten much worse since i started the process of a full dental reconstruction a little lass than a year ago
1-2 times every a month my unfortunately quite small mouth is being stretched waaay beyond reason
i do use this more than at night
its better than my last lip treatment
definitely a replacement for a better price than the dior lip cream
lips will always look bigger
a little goes a very long way
a little goes a long way.
so far i love it
they've become so smooth
my lips are softer than ever before.
it goes on so smooth
i felt like the fresh sugar products were making it worse
have never looked better
i've gotten no real or long term relief
it was just getting worse
loving this overnight mask so far
i expected the product to be "harder"
after months of searching a lip treatment that would actually definitely work
this is even better then the dior balm i got.
a little goes a long way
i already notice my lips look even better during the day
i love it so far
it wasn't making them worse
although the price is somewhat steep you will never run out of this product since a little goes a long way
not a lot but a bit to notice.
a little goes a long way
this has helped so much my lips feel plumper
liquid lippies go on so much prettier
a little goes a long way too!
the packaging was also much more convenient.
i don't find that it lingers for very long
while $20 may seem like a lot
like my lips actually look more plump
i love this and so much product for only $25!
after just a week of nightly use my lips are so much softer
they still look smooth
get this product though
this by far surpasses anything i've used
expect it to last significantly longer than many of my other go-to lip products
this little pink gem does not smell too strongly
a little goes a long way
lipstick goes on so much smoother now
even look more plump
and, the jar is way bigger than i expected.
a little goes a long way
and it is also a lot too.
even on the nights i apply too much
almost alittle bit more full
how much product you get is great for a lot of uses
is a lot considering how little of it i need to use
i'll never be without a little jar of this
a little goes a long way
a little does a very long way
use a little less in the morning
this is how much i love this mask
does not work nearly as good
use i use a little less product
i've had this for a little more than a year
the jar lasts a long time also so don't sweat the $20 too much
it feels mostly fine
a little sure does go a long way
i love it so much
a bit more on the heaver side
it is a little bit of a heavier cream
a little bit goes a long way
a little goes a long way
a little known fact is that this line is produced by amorepacific
this has so much moisture
a little bit goes a long way
so this product will last quite some time as well
i don't need nearly as much as i thought to cover my whole face
this moisture cream has given my face so much love
it still fell into the category of making my skin feel too greasy
i do think it is a little too heavy to put on in the mornings before my makeup
just a little bit goes a long log way.
i wanted a cream that was better quality than the average drugstore cream
it is perfect in the summer when your face is exposed to the sun a little more than normal
i find it to be a little too much for day time use
more hydration than my skin really needed.
how it makes it so smooth
i love how much comes in the container too.
my skin is much smoother.
however i was expecting a little more from the minerals infused in the cream
wanted to feel a little brighter.
a little goes a long way!
it is a little on the thicker side
which i don't mind too much since i only use it at night
i imagine it feeling less than pleasant if you use it during the day under makeup
a little goes a long way
it even reminds me a sleeping pack rather than a cream
very interested to try it out during cold months cause it a little bit heavy for everyday usage during summer
i love the packaging of this little bottle too.
my makeup lays on my skin so much better
as well as a much lower price point
just keep in mind, a little goes a long way.
a little goes a long way
so far i'm enjoying it
this formula works way better
it leaves my skin feeling even better
the packaging looks way more expensive than it actually is
not to the point that it feels heavy
other than that, i love it.
i do think that i would like this product much more in the winter time
have higher than normal st
trying so hard to save some for the winter because i know i'll love it even more then
thus restoring my confidence a little every day
a little goes a long way
it can be a bit tacky if you use too much
a little goes a long way with this product
it does leave skin a little tight
so much product and a great price too!
probably could wprk for those with combination skin as well
just like most of you
i feel even better about it knowing there's no dimethicone in it
i like product that come in pump rather than a jar
none bad enough any more that they can be seen
as much as i do the ingredients
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way
so far, nothing compares to this.
it works so well on my combination skin
found it to works better for me during the day
a little does go along the way
a little seems to go a long way
not much is needed
a little hard to get out near the end.
by the way, a little goes a long way!
feels more smooth when i use this the night before
with this product, a little goes a long way.
i’ve never had better skin in my life.
i do think this is a mask that works better over time
so far i really like this
so far i have not seen a huge difference so that is why i am taking a star off
i used as much as i needed to have an even layer that was mostly opaque
i will say i always left this on for longer than directed
so far i like what my skin looks like after this
they got even worse after i had my daughter
it's better than any expensive sheet masks i have tried before
my skin was better for about 2 days
most younger people don't have the same issues people with older skin do
i will definitely be buying more
my face seemed brighter overall too.
my skin is getting better as i age
using your fingers is probably easier
my skin has never looked better in my entire life
because a little goes a long way
carry less around with me
it still matches my skin even if i get a little sun :
a little product goes a long way
only this is better
a little goes a long way.
a little goes a very long way
a little goes a long way
goes on so well
i love this product so much
maybe could be a tad darker
i wish people would stop whining about glossier since pretty much everything in cosmetics shares the same appearance
great value for what feels like a higher end product
i do think my skin looked a little smoother
noticed my skin felt a little firmer than usual the next morning
i noticed my skin looked a little brighter as well
as far as i could tell
i will say a little goes a long way
t was just too much
so i like it's results thus far!
it's way to much for my price range
a little goes a long way
it started getting softer
i wish the price was a little less
a more even skin tone the next day
the only thing i really didn't like very much was how heavily scented the product was
although i would have liked this serum to feel heavier
although i don't have very deep wrinkles/lines i did notice that it firmed my skin up quite a bit
if i used moisturizer after i felt like i had too much on
felt like i had less lines
i will say the consistency is a little oily if you use too much
i'll be the first to admit o was a little skeptical of this giving me visable results in just 7 short days however
i only used it for a week so perhaps that would have taken a bit longer to get that result
it was a little heavy for day time
it felt a little greasy
my makeup seems to be going on smoother
hope that the longer i use it
the better the results
it was still great none the less
in just 7 days the skin feels much softer
my skin more smoother
only needed a little for my whole face
i even think my pores looked smaller
i would rather just have the product pre mixed for me
a little goes a long way.
it's a lot smoother than it was before.
like to see what it does over a longer period of time
seemed to be more even toned
so far i can say its been pretty good
so far there been none
a little goes a long way
i've never had an even skin tone
so even though it is pricey
it didn't feel much firmer per se.
i think i would need to use this longer
especially since i can see one bottle lasting quite a long time
my makeup has gone on much smoother
i didnt really have too many imperfectionslike wrinkles
my skin is so much smoother.
my skin actually looks smoother
my skin feels softer and more refined looking.
too bad i live far from a sephora
so far loving it
(so far i’m loving it!)
my skin has never felt more moisturizer
although i don't have many fine lines
my skin feels so much softer and firmer.
i felt like my skin was more plump
my only complaint is that the mixture is a little hard to get out of the packaging
maybe it would be better after a longer time of using it
more often than i care to admit
firmer in just less than 7 days
so far i really enjoy this product.
so far so good
it made my skin feel finer
therefore my makeup is performing much better
my skin tone is much more even.
i think my skin looks slightly brighter after using it
a little goes a really long way.
i would go almost as far as saying this msy be a holy grail product
i feel like i have a more uniform skin tone
so far i love it
rather than twice as suggested
so lately i've been having r
i say a difference in the softness to my skin as well as more bounce after just a day or two
it has been giving my skin so much elasticity
i look younger than when i started using it.
my makeup even wears better
never it's only gotten worse as years go on
one is just a little bump
inflammation pretty much gone
not even a little bit
then a little bit more on the spots where i need it
so far so good
the little ones that i knew were about to show up
most of my pimples were either gone or at least 70% smaller
try this product and struggle no more!
unfortunately there was no more in stock
this one is so much better!
it just feels better
is easier for clients they just say
so far i'm loving it.
i like to add a little water
i've seen so much improvement on my skin.
it looks way more healthier than before.
what i like about it is that you can use it more than once a week
overall your skin just looks healthier
my skin looks sooo much better
this mask definitely changed my skin for the better
it helps my other skin care items work better as well as brightening my skin
a little of the mask goes a long way
my skin texture is more even
my skin looks even better in the am
its definitely one of the better mask i've used.
this is just as good if not better
oh, and a little goes a long way too !
my skin tone is more even
it keeps getting better and better
one thing i love about this mask is that it made my pores smaller
it’s better to get to the root of the problem than just cover it
this has helped me clear my skin in so many ways!
my face doesn't get nearly as much or as bad of acne as i normally do
although it is so light
found i could use less foundation than usual
has made it more even
my dry spots are also pretty much gone after one week of use
my face feels soooo much more hydated after using this
a little goes a very long way
a little goes a long way.
loving this so much!
it is so light
wear better when i use this
a little bit goes a long way
my make-up looks much better too since it's a primer
a little goes a long way.
i don't even have to apply very much
so a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way.
not only that but a tiny bit goes a long way.
have gotten so many compliments on looking more rested
a little goes a long, long way.
tip: a little goes a long way
far longer then my foundation.
makes me look so much more awake
you won’t be spending much on primers after using this since your skin will look better even without makeup
i feel better, look better and is more confidant.
the skin around eyes is looking plumper with fewer little wrinkles just after 2 weeks
you only need a little
a little goes a long way
i've always been into heavier eye creams.
i love it so much
so far it's a five star from me.
now i'll admit i been reaching for this cream more than any other i have
the price is a little bit more than i usually pay for a moisturizer
a little goes a long ways.
however it maybe a little too heavy in summer for oily skin
a little comes a long way
helps a little bit with my acne
my skin has never looked better
my skin has never been better
honestly makes breakouts like 90% smaller
i love it so much
little bottle started my quick descent into purchasing way too many kiehl's products over the past two years
no matter how rough my night was
so far i love the scent
less is more with this one
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way.
dab it in a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way
a little goes a very long way.
i know that at first glance the price is a bit staggering for some of us
so far, i used it few times & really like it!
well priced as you don't need much.
so glad sephora carries it now
i've tried others, but none are quite as good.
it works better then $60 plus masks that i have tried
or maybe even better.
a little goes a long way.
i've had it for quite some time
i still have a good amount left
it's a pretty thick gel so a little goes a long way
you get a lot of bang for your buck because it lasts a long time
after trying so many different face washes
a little goes a long way with this one
of course i've left it on longer
it does well then too
even better if you keep it in the fridge
sometimes i've left it on for longer with no issues
red something more pungent i think you should go in a different direction
a little goes a long way.
it even took care of my dark circles a little bit
also a little bit goes such a long way
plus people never believe i'm more than 24
got much more smooth
i love how it makes the under eye look smoother
it changed my skin for the better
in a short time the tone of the skin looks more luminous❤️
those are considerably faded as well
now mother nature says it's payback
you will have more trouble removing makeup
it works so well
& its lasts so long!
my pores are so much smaller now because of this mask
when ever my skin feels a little bit dull i use this
it stings my face a little bit sometimes when i apply it which tells me i have tiny little cuts on my face
it seems like nothing has ever helped
keep up the use for even better results
i only wish it would work better on my period acne
felt so much better
this little gem has not gotten rid of my oil woes
helping so much with getting rid of my acne scars
maybe even a little brighter
it's a lot smoother now.
a little goes a long way
love this product so much!
liked the results so much that i went back
notice that even my makeup applies so much nicer than before
a rep at sephora pointed me towards the 3-little wonders
my skin was much smoother
it will sting a little bit
my moisturizer seems to work better
my pores have been looking much smaller
now i hardly ever breakout
my skin was softer and more even-toned.
my skin has never looked better
definitely going too by the bigger one.
this did so much more.
my makeup goes on so much better
it looks like they've put it on a new bottle
so far only review
so far i've noticed that i haven't been breaking out as much as before i'd say i'm only getting about 10% of what has been the norm for me for about two years
my makeup application looks much smoother
the only reason i'm giving it 4 stars is because it it quite expensive
i like it better than some other similar products that cost way more
the moisturizer i use afterward absorbs much better in my skin
a little goes a long way
i've tried so many others
tried this product in the mini 3 little wonders kit
most of my little bumps are gone
it had improved my skin so much.
i don't break out more than the r
a little goes a long way
purchasing until i find something better
lately it doesn't seem as effective
more even skin tone
the ones on my cheek are a little more stubborn
my makeup sits way better on my face.
this product actually changed my life
sometimes it stings a bit when i first put it on
one of the biggest issues that i think cause my acne is that my skin turns over too fast
getting better after 20 seconds
a think layer works better than globbing it on
this product has really made my skin look so much nicer
my skin never looked so better.
the fact that it comes in a pump bottle makes it even better
it also fights blemishes if i have a few little ones coming up
pretty much every time i have gotten drinks
my skin decided it no longer liked what i had been using
specifically on the area in the corners of my mouth/chin area far more than before
my complexion has already gotten better
my skin had a more refined look.
it is lasting me a long time
and a little goes a long way!
that my foundation looked more even
a little bit with pores too
i find a little goes a long way
the night treatment only requires a little bit.
the only negative thing i have to say about this is that it burns slightly for the 10-15 seconds that i have it on my face
loving my results so far.
nothing bad to say about this product so far.
a little goes a long way
that being said i feel like too much may be drying?
i see so many benefits from just this one product- evens texture
it's very thick and a little goes a long way.
days when my skin can use a little extra
nothing suited my skin well enough to buy it
because it was cheaper than the other one
i also feel like it's been responsible for a few small white heads on my face which i'd hardly ever gotten before using this
i just wish it gave me a little more hydration
on another not i was a little concerned about break-outs with the richer cream
the only downside for me is that it makes my skin oiler than usual
a little bit of this keeps it under control
as i generally pick something lighter to put under my foundation
far better than dozens of others i've tried with heftier price tags
a little bit goes a long way
pros:great for rosaceaa little goes a long wayhelps with combination skinsoothinglightweight
again, a little goes a long way.
if you use too much you will feel a bit greasy.
my skin feels so much softer
usually make up just makes it worse
a little goes a long way
t soaks into your skin pretty quickly for being a more heavier product
so far i love it
plus, - little goes a long way.
i found by applying a little each morning my skin is so much calmer
as a teen this was defs a bigger purchase money wise for me
a little goes a long way
this has helped sooo much
i need something that's stronger
makes my makeup application look so much better
this one is much thicker than the sheer transformation lotion
i can still apply makeup without feeling like i have too much on
no matter how much i use
a little goes a long way
i love how it absorbs easily too.
so far i have no problems with breakouts
it is pricey, but a little goes a long way!
so this jar lasts a very long time
it just feels better
little goes a long way
it's a bit more thick than the others
now we all pay $4 more for about a third less
a little goes a long way.
i think i may love this one more than sheer transformation
i've never had better results from a moisturizer alone
my complexion has never looked brighter or better
yet light enough to wear during the day under makeup as well
since i started using this a night my skin feels so much better its hydrated
a little goes a long way.
did notice my skin become a little dull
only thing is i wish it was cheaper.
it helps with my redness so much
i've never had a product work so well.
i would consider it to be more of a rich-formula that is meant for people with normal skin
i never spent money on a high end cleanser before this one because often they aren't better than drugstore
it gets rid of tough makeup too.
i couldn't be happier
i even see some dark acne spots getting lighter
plus a very little but goes a long way!
none would work as well without this cleanser
it could last more if you used less than i do each time you washed
it also lasts for a very long time
a little goes a very long way
a little of this goes a long way to not only cleaning the face
a little goes a very long way
my skin looks much healthier
i've tried too many to count
a little goes a long way for sure
a little goes a long way
a little bit goes a long way, suds nicely.
it also lasts a very long time
i like it very much
lasts a really long time
my skin feels and looks better.
i personally need something a little stronger to help with my acne
a little goes a long way
my skin has never looked better :).
of course, in a better way.
a little goes a long way!
i must say that it is slightly drying when used with my clairsonic
a little more pricey than i'm used to
and i love the little bit of citrus...
i couldn't be happier
now my skin is much closer to normal
a little is enough for one use
a little goes a long way
the price seems like a lot at first
removes make up much better than most eye cleansers i have used
because it lasts for so long
a little goes a long way so this bottle will last a long time
a little bit goes a long way
a little goes a long way!
although a little expensive the bottle is huge
a little goes a long way
the results are better than anticipated
a little bit goes a long way
it lasts a really long time
my skin's texture is better too
i like this cleanser so much that i have two bottles
i would like it more if it had more of an orange scent
this takes off my eye makeup much better
the bottle is a little expensive
so fading probably happened some time ago
they all love it just as much
during the summer time it becomes slightly more oily
it works so well
it really does make my pores look smaller.
i first tried this product in the "3 little wonders" bundle
it's just as good if not better
i skip a primer because this makes my foundation look so much nicer on my skin than most primers
it seems to leave my face a little sweatier than normal
my skin has been giving me quite a bit of trouble lately
it did slightly even my skin tone
makes my makeup look 10000x better!
will be a little too heavy in the summer
i quite like it as a base under foundation
this would be a lot better if it came in a pump or squeeze tube
i feel like it works better than a silicon based primer
my face feels a little smoother or more even the more i use this
a little seems to go a long way for me.
only thing that would make it better is if it were in a pump dispenser
only 4 stars since i need to use it more often to be for sure
my face has never been more smooth
now my face is more clear
smooth than ever before
you only need a little dab to get the job done
as long as they make it
love this product so much!!
this has been so smooth
it is very light, and a little goes a long way.
texture is now far more balanced
a little goes a long way.
i feel like with other moisturizers i have to use twice as much
did have to use a bit more than usual in my dry areas
i do feel like once i used a bit more in those places
it is a bit too light to use as a night moisturizer right now
since i started using it my skin tone is noticeably more even
my scars seem to be lightening a little bit
a little bit goes a long way
plus this helps smooth all the little bumps.
i don't tend to breakout as much as before
this product has helped my skin so much.
especially because you need so little each time you use it
i still buy it because it makes my skin that much prettier
i will probably supplement with a thicker/heavier cream in the winter
i've used this about 6 times so far under different foundations
so far so good.
a lot goes a long way
my skin does not create more oil
and it does so much for your skin!
a little goes a long way so it lasts a long time.
loved it so much that i'll probably repurchase 'til the end of time
my skin already looks so much brighter
a little goes a long way
great for the eyes too as it's not too intense.
my skin looks a little fuller
everything is just a little tighter
my skin is healthier looking than its ever been
makes my skin more even
it helped with the uneven tones on my skin so much that now i am able to go out with out any foundation on
made my skin color look so much more even
with this one my skin just looks tighter
a little goes a long way
my overall skin tone looked healthier, too.
with much deeper wrinkles
could test it out a little bit
my face is smooth and healthier than ever.
i can use a lot less foundation/concealer now that i've used this for a little while
well i have tried loads of products without much improvement
plus my skin tone is more even than it has ever been
is it a little pricey?
my makeup looked so much better
since i tend to wear very little makeup if any
the tone is definitely more even
probably could have gotten much more time with this had i not wasted so many pumps in the beginning of testing the serum out
my skin is much more even
my complexion appears to be more even.
just from the little bit that i have used
and a little bit goes a long way.
over all healthier looking
i can visibly see my skin looking more glowy just after a week
my skin hasn't ever looked better
a little goes a long way too.
i just look younger
couldn't recommend it more.
i definitely recommend this if your skin needs a little boost of moisture
my skin is quite a bit softer
a little goes a long way
rather it has made my skin more healthy i feel.
more importantly how it looks
my skin had never been more amazing
my skin looks so good after a week of using that i'm comfortable leaving the house with little to no makeup
looks so much better
great product, lasts a long time too!
my skin tone is so much more even
no more break outs
his skin is so much smoother
brighter than i have ever seen it
i feel it does help my complexion look fresher with less break outs
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way
while the price is a little high
you have to use just a little bit
it was just a little too intense for my skin
it is pretty strong, but it fades away quickly.
had terrible breakouts this moisturizer may have been too much
it is hard to find things for skin that is a little older
a little bit of this product goes a long way.
which i think is better
a little goes a long way.
the only thing is that the price is a little bit high
so far i am in love with this product.
overall makeup set even better with this lotion
my skin feels better
looks better with this product
overall it's worth the little bit of shine i get in the afternoon
smell than what i was accustomed to
has a bit of a tightening feel to it
a little bit definitely goes a long way.
does cause my face to produce more oil than usual
the sturdy glass really makes me feel safer about carrying this around or traveling with it as well as make it much easier to find :p
so far, this has done wonders for my face!
it is a little expensive for the amount of product you get
a little goes a long way
in only one week my face has become a lot brighter
my skin already looks so much healthier
disappointing to see it is over $10 cheaper many other places
it just is so light
this seems to do a good job with not making it any more so
more than i have experienced before
only takes a little bit
a little goes a long way
more even toned skinl love
you only need a little product for the whole face
i only like to wear it during the day though as i feel it isn't intensive enough as a night time moisturizer
my skin feels smoother as well as looking smoother
a little goes a long way
i've never broken out that much
nothing else seems to work better than this
without making my skin oilier than usual
a little bit goes a long way.
i find that it helps balance my skin for a better make up application
also a little goes a long way
the new texture makes it a little more difficult to get the product out
i would go for something a little lighter in the summer
i've also noticed my skin looks much healthier.
a little goes a long way.
it was a tad to thick for me even though i needed intense hydration
i enjoy this one so much more
it's been ahhhhmazing at that as well
i give products that much time to actually work on my skin
a little goes a long way!!!!!
don't need as much
a little goes a long way
its no longer there
fell like it might be too young for me to use it
i keep trying to find something as good that isn't as expensive
a little goes a long way!
it's very expensive but it will last a long time.
maybe a tad more on the dry side
its a bit hard to explain
definitely more so a night cream than a day cream
the key is not to use too much
allows me to take just a little bit at a time
i sometimes find myself adding more to my skin than it needs
i love it so much.
usually most creams tend to make little difference or evaporate quickly
a little does go a long way
it is definitely the most expensive product i've ever even looked at
a little goes a long way
very good cream - a little goes a long way.
as others have mentioned a little goes a very long way
a little goes a long way with this product.
a little goes a long way
my skin has never looked better.
it can be a little greasy
this is it so far
my skin is so much better
concentrated that it will probably last long
a little does go a long way so the jar will last a long time
it is very thick which means you use to little that it lasts forever
much cheaper than the 3 1/2 hour drive to la from where i live
i think if i used too much it could block a pore or two
a little goes a long way.
however i like fresh's creme better
even the wrinkles are looking better.
as long as you don't apply too much
it is a little expensive
a tiny little bit goes such a long way
it takes a bit longer for it to completely skin in
a littel goes a long way
my skin has never been better
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way with this product
it can be a little greasy
my fine lines are getting deeper--
you only need a little bit
a little goes a long way
looked so much better
goes on quite easily
pretty big jar that lasts a long time!
penetrates much better than la mer.
i find it a bit heavy
but i still like it.
try a more expensive product
it is a little too heavy for day
only thing she complained about is being a little too greasy
however in this case i think a lot of people are just over reacting
can make me break out more
it is so light
i actually like the smell very much
so far i love it.
i also care more about a moisturizer working well than smelling well
seems a little more important to me
this helps so much
so far so good
so far so good
not bad, better than perfume
i no longer feel i need to look further for something better
it goes on smoother
since using this my face is sooo much better
a little actually does go a long way
a little goes a long way for me
i wanted to try this moisturizer for so long after hearing so much about it
a little did not go a very long way
this is the only product that has helped lighten them so far
it does seem expensive at first
a little goes a long way
made my pores look much smaller
i think my skin tone is more even
not only does my skin feel smoother than ever before
solid product that's a lot gentler than retin-a.
too bad sephora no longer carries this br
for guys i would definitely recommend using it no more than this
of course this is coming from someone who has already built up quite a tolerance to retinol
but other than that no side effects.
my skin is much clearer!
acne scars- i use this product 2-3 times a week because every night was too much for me at this point
i've had this for quite a while.
normally pretty much anything will break me out
a little bit would do the trick
as time went on i felt like i needed to use more
this product is nothing less than amazing!
a little goes a long way!
my overall skin tone is much more even .
but so far so good.
nothing has ever done what this product has for my skin
a little goes a long way.
most people think i look younger than i am
my acne has never been better.
have read so much about the redness
so far after 3 days pores are smaller
this is good so far and hasn't irritated my skin.
it's worked pretty well for my skin as far as smoothing out the texture
lastly why i highly recommend this product is because i've only been using it for a little less than 2 weeks
old marks are fading much more quickly than normal
my skin has improved more than i thought in just 3 weeks
they were too harsh
in a formula that is much gentler to my skin
worse than my teen years even.
what is there is easier to clear.
following with a little help me
this works well with that too
it can make acne worse before it makes it better because it brings everything to the surface
i really like it so far
philosophy is much more affordable
sadly it's just too expensive for me.
use this more as a preventative so can't say much about results
a lot goes a long way
they look a bit softer
i need to be very careful to only put a tiny bit there
i feel that this product made my skin tone look so more more even
my skin just feels healthier day after day with this product
help me has made my skin tone more even
this product has helped my skin so much.
this has helped my skin clear up so much
it felt brighter, lighter, smoother, and nicer.
healthy than it has in years
dark spots started to fade a little bit
i still have spots
i also feel that my skin got a little bit firmer/tighter
the tube lasts me a little less than 2
rather than the cream
my face is clearer than ever
nothing with this so far
it will be even more of a difference
it has done a lot to even my skin tone
i wake up to much brighter skin than if i don't use it
i much prefer it to mederma
my skin looks better than it has in a very long time
wrinkles were so much smoother or barely there
i believe i can say my skin is more even-toned
just a bit 'fresher' in appearance
i can see that my face all-around looks healthier
it's really one of the more reasonably priced products of its kind out there
it is easier to deal with
seems to go away quicker
a little goes a long way
this gel uses very little product that goes a long way
one of my complaints is how little you get for the price
you usually get a lot more product with those as well
my under eyes looked better than ever
looks so much brighter
'm going to buy some more of this
they seem to keep getting worse
maybe black tea or other stuff can better help prevent fine lines
all you need is a little pump to pat around both eyes
when i use this, i can see my eyes look bigger.
i can also feel more light getting into my eyes
it's probably better used at night
a half a pump goes a long way
for a much needed pick-me-up
will definitely try more fresh products
because i love this one so much
i do like how much product is in the bottle
after that not so much.
however i don't see much changes under my eyes
i think it gets great results especially when compared to other more expensive eye creams
so far so good
a little goes a long way for its lightweight texture
i look better and see the difference.
so far so good.
i am really starting to see bigger improvements in my eye area
maybe a bit with dark circles
i think helps tighten the skin too
so maybe more suitable for younger people
it could do a little better on the dark circles
will know better when i'm done
you want something better for that.
is great for a more well rested look
just a good eye moisturizer for nothing too heavy
dryed out skin no more!!
it is not as harsh as glamglow
i can really tell my acne or little whiteheads going away faster than they would normally
a little goes a long way
broke out even worse
i never thought it would do much more than that
you get way more product for your $$
perhaps even less bloated face
my skin is softer than it has ever been
the blackheads that were once huge are so much smaller now
in my opinion it's better than glamglow
i've always had rough skin growing up
this makes it feel smoother after using
i keep it on a little longer than suggested.
helps with pimples making them less smaller in a few days
i see more results from this than i do the glamglow clearing treatment mask
makes them less red
a little goes a very long way
he's seeing results as well so that won't be the case any longer :
much more gentle on the skin
my skin has never been better since i started using it
not sure it is any better than other clay masks out there
i probably need more time to see if it shrinks my pores
it is a little pricey
i usually have a lot of break outs
'm always extra cautious when trying out new skin care
although the longer you leave the mask on the more oil it seems to suck out
the tone is overall more even
my acne has become a lot better
see if my complexion gets better
you don't need much product to begin with
my face hasn't felt so smooth or healthy in such a long time
because now i'm going to invest a little
but it wouldn't last too long.
continues to look better every time i use it
feel this is a much better fit for my skin
nicer on the first use
so far it helps a lot
my face looks so much better
does a lot over night to reduce them
which is generally harder to accomplish with more oily skin types
i've also found that the leftover marks seem to fade/heal a lot faster
my skin looks much better afterward
it now looks better than it ever has
is that when you apply this to any popped spots it helps them heal much more quickly
i rarely leave on longer than the 2-3 minutes required
with a much more reasonable price
i wish this was sold in a bigger tube with more product
i wish there was a little more 'bang for your buck' on this
however i do think it is a bit heavy for summer day usage
i think that for summer time it may be a bit too much
a little goes a long way
i love this moisturizer so much.
my skin looks way younger than all of my friends.
a little goes a long way
only need to squeeze a bit out
i've tried to find one that i like better that is also not as expensive
a little goes a long way
it only takes a little
spread over that a little more
i love it so far.
a little goes a long way
this product lasts quite a while
this moisturizer even better!
it spreads well so while the tube is not huge a little goes a long way
i do look younger just from this one product
i wish it came in a bigger size because i use it so often
no other product has done a better job than this.
they only thing about it that i would say is that is a little pricy for the tube it comes in
maybe just the tiniest bit heavy
this has worked better than philosophy
the back ground to me buying this was that i needed a little more heavy duty moisturizer
a liitle goes a long way .
like everyone says, a little goes a long way.
although i can see it being great for daytime too
even though this tube may seem smaller
a little goes a long way
my skin looks better than ever.
nothing makes my acne go better than this stuff
every caudalie product i have tried so far
she uses it too
a little goes a long way
wish it was a little less expensive
my skin is actually breaking out less
i wish it came in a bigger tube.
evenly that i hardly need very much at all
this creme packs all its skin-improving benefits into a little tube that'll last for ever
really gave a lot of moisture without being too heavy
works better or just as good as the really expensive moisturizers
i've tried several "lighter" creams that don't quite get the job done
a little goes a long way
it does the job well
a little goes a long way!
it is better than most cleansers because it does not leave my skin feeling tight nor stripped of moisture
my makeup also stays on longer!
this is much better
my only complaint is that there is a bit too much fragrance for my liking
it is the only skin cleanser that works for me that i have found so far
throughout the day my skin actually looks more dewey
the bottle is enough to last a very long time.
you only need a little
my skin has never looked better
however it still irritated my skin somewhat
a little goes a long way
my skin has never looked better.
for me it just means i have to use less moisturizer afterwards
this stuff is way better
maybe because it is a little too gentle
so paying more money for anything more fancy is a waste in my opinion
i get better results for some reason
will probably need to use something a little stronger when i have the r
well i realized how much this cleanser helps my skin
i couldn't be happier
have started taking care more
more of what i put in my skin
i love this product so much.
i've gone through so many bottles of this
this has been better than any acne cleanser that i've tried
it's even better then the murad one for acne.
it does not foam up too much in your h
love love love a little product takes you far i've had this for almost a year
it actually works so well
i'd love it more if the packaging is nicer though
i then repeat with a little more to do my checks
i really love this face cleaner i never have to worry about it leaving product behind no matter if i have done my makeup up for a night out or i've had a long day at work
this clears up my skin better than any other product i've used
a little goes a long way too.
it costs a bit more than i would normally spend on cleanser
her acne was 40% better after 1 day use
my face feels better than it has in a long time
so far so good
a little goes a long way with this cleanser.
dry out my skin even more than it already was
a little goes a long way
also a little goes a long way!
that's how much i enjoy it.
know i'm not using too much or little of the product
a little goes a long way
good price as well considering a little goes a really long way with this
i feel is better than the black cleanser
so maybe i used more because of that
causing me to breakout even more
not expecting to love it as much
like it so much
now i'm feeling they are all wasted money
every new product i try i break out even worse
although i wish it lasted a little longer or was at least a tad bit cheaper
from the start my skin became more balanced
i love it so much!
consistency of this product also how long it'll last me because of how little i have to use each time
a little bit goes a long way!!
i feel it's a great value--i would pay more than $28 for it
i think $28 is a bit much for something that gets washed down the drain
you only need a little bit
what surprised me the most is that i need to use fewer other face products- less moisturizer
a little goes such a long way!
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way
i've tried so many other ones
maybe product finishes too fast
so far love this product
plus a little goes a long way
for me the most irritating part is not being able to tell how much is left in the product
probably makes it a little less likely to hyperpigment
plus you only need a little so this pen actually lasts quite awhile
rather than breaking out all over
had a bunch of little bumps
be way less painful in the process
wish it actually made spots look less irritated too
does help my breakouts get better
it usually just makes it worse
my only wish is that it came in a bigger bottle.
the acne cleared up much faster
comes with far less product
it was much more convenient
healing time is so much faster
it definitely ends it a lot quicker
the bigger bottle is always out for a reason
it works, but it works slowly ... for me anyway.
although i rarely ever break out
my skin is definitely doing much better
makes it disappear a little bit quicker
as it's harder to "zap" bigger/more developed zits
it seems like it does little to nothing
because i feel like i get more hits than misses
i started with the travel size to see how well it would work
one bottle usually lasts me the better part of the year
my pimple didnt get any bigger
before it still hurts a little
this product has worked better than anything else i've tired
what i like most about this product is that it absorbs well into the skin
overall face makeup looks so much better than it used to
look even more tired
although sometimes in the winter i'll do two :
a little goes a long way, which i also like.
i think they've lessened
however it hasn't done much at all for my dark circles
too much comes out when i press the pump
so some goes to waste
way too much comes out on a whole pump
a little goes a long way with this product.
i don't find it helping much with my wrinkles
not sure about about how much it helps to imporve dark cirles
it is so light
although my dark cicles are still there.
pressing all the way down would give you too much product
my eye area feels so smooth and tighter.
love this product so much!
better than any gel type eye products.
it is a little on the heavy side
i feel better knowing that i'm not using a product full of chemicals to combat fine lines
great price for a product that lasts a long time even when using am
a little goes a long way.
i don't use during the day as it seems to be a bit too much for under my makeup
the only gripe i have is that the pump lets out far too much product- so beware
i also expected it to help me a little bit on that
so far so good
so far it really works well to diminish puffiness
a bit more expensive than some of the others
it also lasts for a really long time considering the bottle is so small
not that much of a problem
put off buying more
still got a little more to go
so far so good
seems to make the dark circles appear lighter too
a little goes a long way
cleans my face far more than any other
mine are more thin skin than being tired
i hope this is better than my prior eye treatments
fades my under eye circles-a little goes a long way
too much moisture or too much richness would make my eyes puffy
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way!
i mean very little!
you don't need to use very much at a time
it illustrates how badly i needed this to work
it's richer than a gel
so far the eye cream has not triggered anything.
it is more like a gel
at first it feels a little greasy
because i was rubbing my eyes so much
you barely need any product to cover the whole area
it could be that i just consume way too much sodium
a little goes a long way
which made my skin even worse
i could care less if it brightens or not
however i think maybe a little too much
when i use a little more than during the day
if you look for more brightening
aren't we all on the hunt for something better?
it's been great so far for the cold mn winter.
my skin just looks so much brighter
a little goes a long way with this moisturizer.
people even comment on how much younger i look
to fade them bit by bit
this one is the first one to work bit by bit
i also believe the brightening claims as my skin tone seems more even
so far i am in love with this moisturizer.
my skin no longer looked healthy
a little goes a fairly long way
my only complaint is that it is too heavy to use in the morning
the results keep getting better
it goes on so smooth
my skin is more even
my acne is healing much faster when i do get one or couple
my makeup goes on so much nicer/better.
great worn alone too.
didn't really notice how much it improved
this is the only thing that worked for me so far
my skin has gotten better through the use of products/bc
it does it job as my skin is much brighter.
a little more in the winter does the trick
i even went as pricey as perricone
so far other korres products it doesn't
other than the fact that is very moisturzing
since then i have tried plenty of different ones from less expensive to much more expensive products
my skin feels better
i also noticed it starting to look better
i've found that this moisturizer is a little more intense
a little goes a long way
i enjoy the fact that it is not too heavy for me
i could see it being too strong for some
a little really goes a long way
not too mention a little goes a long way
it might have lasted longer if my husb
that too has improved
a little goes a loooong way too
the scent is a bit too
i felt my skin looked more even
it has made my skin so much brighter
i love this product so much i have combination skin
this really balances it out overnight i get a dewy more fresher look in the morning
balancing my skin has really helped more than anything else in the past
i do believe tone and texture are more even also.
which was a little too light for me
my acne has gotten better, actually.
it make my face more brighter !!!
so far i love the smell
all and all i like this product very much
i couldn't be happier
i'll still probably buy more when my bottle runs out
a little goes a long way
though perhaps a bit more watery than i would like
i love this cleanser so much.
my skin is better than it's ever been.
certainly deserves more than the low reviews people are giving it because they don't underst
i love it so much.
it became much more soft
a little goes a long way
all in all great product, even tho it is pricey.
it has helped my acne so much that it is insane
smell is a little bit weird, but is short lived.
helps cleansing even better
there are definitely better cleansers
everything i love in a cleanser plus it's cheaper than a lot of other options on sephora
s for a even better refreshing feeling when washing it off
i've never truly loved any other cleanser more than this one
a little goes a long way none the less
it is slightly drying if used more than 2or 3times in a row so make sure to rotate it through your routine
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way.
so much love for this product!
in addition, a little product goes a long way!
just hoping not too much comes out
throughout the last 10 years i've tried several cleanser just to see if anything else was better
much less oil during the day
it even feels tighter after i am done using it
love it so so much
my skin has never looked better
my skin is much more clear!
i still do since it just makes it look better
it has very little scent
it goes a long way too.
it's great even though i have sensitive skin i'll probably end up buying the full size because i like how it works on my skin i've used it a couple of times
so far it has not caused any breakouts
i think i'll be sticking to it for a very long time
the less steps the better.
it actually leaves my skin looking younger
my pores have become noticeably smaller too!
a little goes a long way too.
i still have plenty of it left
can control how much i use
the pump puts out too much
it has helped so much with my acne
i love this so much!!!!
your better off treating your face with products so you can use less make-up
you don't need more than that
it just seems to make it worse
and you only need a little of it.
a little goes a long way
a little bit goes a long way
you have to be careful--a little goes a long way.
i went to so many dermatologists who gave me prescribed medicine which only made things worse
be warned that a little goes a long way
so don't use too much
it was way too much for my face
i couldn't be happier!
i just wish it was a little cheaper for the line
my face is no longer red
my skin has become alot more calm
i am in love with murad's products so far!
like it very much
after using this product i have to say perfect skin i no longer have the red
now i only need a little bit of concealer for day long wear
so far i like it
a tiny bit goes a long way too
this redness relief product is exactly what i needed after being out in too much florida sun
i felt that they were still too harsh
can really see improvement in my skin after using for more than a month now
too- a little really goes a long way
this i like much better
really enjoying this purchase so far.
probably a bit early to claim results though it does seem my skin tone is a bit brighter
with in one week of using this every morning i could see my skin was a lot more radiant
it really does help his face have less lashes
my skin feels smoother already.
my skin stays a little brighter than it normally would
so far so good
my sking is getting better
skin seems tighter and move even in color.
this is much better than anthony's eye cream.
just made it look even
my complexion is slightly more even
this product makes the skin look younger
you just look more
much less like it
he liked it so much he asked me to order more for him
my skin just looks so much better when i use it
i can no longer see my pores
as well as made the pores on my nose much much smaller
i definitely notice a difference when i go without it for too long
my skin has improved so much since using this.
the only down sides are that it takes a little bit of time to soak in
using this makes my skin beautiful as my younger years even though i'm only 36
my skin is so much tighter
some people have naturally bigger pores
it'll do a great job minimizing them as much is actually possible
so it seems to have started to work.
it does sting a bit, however.
shrinks them quite a bit
it definitely makes my pores look smaller
i did stray away for a few months after my second bottle trying other products to see if i could get better results with a more expensive br
my skin is much smoother
since this one works so well
a little goes a long way
i'll probably buy more of this br
they can always be smaller right?
they look so much better
really made me break out worse
stay with it for at least 8 weeks-i do notice clearer skin
to much for my skin
my skin is smoother now than ever before
no problems so far
i will definitely be buying more of this product.
i don't have to wear as much foundation which is a plus now that we're getting to summer
i can tell my pores are getting a little smaller
it does do a little bit to make pores less snoticable
pores are looking much smaller after only a couple weeks
i am hoping that it will penetrate even deeper
i just think i need to give it more time.
my skins rarely breaks out now as long as i use this product
i think that might be too harsh.
it seems as we get older the pores get larger
my pores literally look much smaller
pretty much the exact opposite of what i was hoping for
you don't need very much, which is always a plus.
or you may burn easier than usual
start with the skin and everything works better.
i went through a whole bottle of perricone md intensive pore minimizer without feeling like it did much
which makes it go on better than if your skin is slightly wet still
this really helped make them look smaller
it also lasts me quite a long time because i only use it on such a small area of the face
a little bit goes a very long way
it looks much better.
much less obvious from a couple feet away
it costs less as well
my skin looks smoother after just a few uses
i really have seen my pores get smaller since i have been using this product
it made my skin around my nose so much smoother than normal
the more you use it, the better it works.
my skin hasn't looked this good in such a long time
maybe i need to wait longer for that
because there is nothing in those little holes when you use it
my skin had never looked better
my skin actually seemed to break out a little more right when i started using the product
probably as long as they make it
we'll just appear bigger
use just a bit, a little goes along way.
remained bigger than normal
the pores look better
another plus is that a little goes a long way.
a little tight in the morning
has made him less agitated as well
either get too little or too much
'll have to buy it more often
i will say my skin got a little more red for about a week afterwards
a little bit goes a long way
this product is a little pricey
this moisturizer lasts a lot longer
the difference was pretty much immediate.
'm not sure how much more product i have left
smooth rather than red
this product helped it a lot!
perhaps it helped with the acne as well
don't know how my skin will react to this as it gets warmer
because i needed a little color.
i wish it was less expensive
it is far too expensive for the size jar you get.
i've never had as much luck with a line
my skin felt better
my dermatologist said that some of them actually can make sensitive skin worse
it also breaks out into these little bumps often
a little does go a long way
it is a little expensive
could be a bit too much for me to use twice a day
a little bit really goes a long way
heavier than it really is
my skin feels so much better using this cream
it is getting worse as i get older
i wish the packaging was better, though.
you don't need much - a little goes a long way.
just one little pump
it is much more expensive
so far i like it enough to not have returned it.
more so than other products i've tried
this has left my skin softer than anything i have ever used
probably haven't used this as often as i should to see more results
after a few days my skin already looked so much better
i think i actually look better having used it for two weeks
it seems to smooth out that look as well
this cream helps more than anything else i've tried
feels sooo much better
above my eyes seem much brighter
i started feeling like i needed something stronger
brightens the under eye area so much so that i dont have to use as much concealer now
liked better than many other more expensive eye creams that claim to do the same things this one does
a little bit goes a long way
a little goes a long way.
using this product at night really helps--my eyes are much less puffy in the morning
warning -hylexine is way more expensive
after using it for about a month i have definitely noticed my circles are considerably lighter
this is one of the better ones
this has done a pretty good job so far
i need something that is a better mosturizer
puffiness are so much better an hour after i apply
this is the only eye cream i've used that seems to help somewhat with my dark under eye circles
feels like it tightens the area just a bit
but so far so good...
have never had a problem with too much mess
thought it probably wouldn't do much to improve my skin
little did i know how well it would work
it looks pretty much the same as the day i got it
if i use it every day i have very little skin issues
use it 3-7 times a week depending on how bad my skin is
it seems like doing so would ultimately be an expensive
but it still works well
it is a little bit of a pain to use
they would go away so much faster!
while it can be messy
i've only used a little less than half of it
it is helping her more than all else
i can see why the price tag would be a little discouraging
it is a little pricey
trust me it lasts a long long time
if i feel more oily than usual i leave on longer
i rarely spend money on myself
i like them too
which just kept getting worse
i pretty much do a 10 minute mask in the morning
especially for how long it lasts
my acne has been 50% better
the bar seems to last quite a while
my skin has never felt cleaner than after using.
a little goes a long way.
i started getting little bumps
this bar does the trick better than anything i have tried previously
the only thing i will say that may be a small drawback is that it does feel a little drying
it isn't the skin just feels tighter
this clay goes a long way
i notice i've been a lot less oily at the end of the day
actually just seemed to make my breakouts worse
my face is so much clearer
pretty much all cleared up
if anything just calmer
i see a better more beautiful difference from it
or if what i'm using has too many chemicals in it
even though i use it a lot, it lasts forever.
used with the umbrian clay moisturizer my face has never looked better
and then it just kept getting better and better.
then my skin only cleared up that much more you know
not as much as the rest of my face though
it improved my skins appearance so much
i'd rather have that than to have many small pimples
the bar lasts a very long time
brighter than ever before
better value than the tube version
you use a lot less
add more water when needed :
it is a bit tricky to use, but so worth it.
since it lasts longer
more than 2 pimples at a time in my book
it seemed like i was wasting a lot of product
i loved it so much
was smoother in a matter of days
mostly just use it by itself
my skin looks more even
my face has never been better
your face feels a little tight after use
i've had the umbrian clay bar for quite a while now
the bar has so much more clay than the tube formula
there are a few good things about this:1.
my face just seems to clear up from a zit a little faster with this added
i tend to leave it on a bit longer than what the directions say too
everything i have tried has either made me oilier or made my acne worse
my skin has never looked more brighter
even feels much much smoother
the little one lasted me a super long time because you do not need much of the product
a little goes a long way.
'm okay with spending a little more on this
have no problem with this product's pretty high price
it works just as well with your h
a little bit goes a long way
my skin is even more balanced
love this cleanser so much.
my skin has never looked better
it's been less than a week
'm giving it some more time
so, far so good.
you will never find a better face wash.
works way more effective than harsh
depending on how much i beat my face
will definitely repurchase even though it is expensive
i wanted to stray from overly chemical face washes because they did more harm than good
it helped her out too
i pretty much owe this cleanser the skin
a little goes a long way
mostly normal on the rest
my face was a mess for so long
i felt that their products were too harsh
so face washes that are too aggressive cause me to break out
my makeup went on like 80% better
i couldn't be happier
if a product took care of one problem it made the other one worse
my skin has never looked better
a little goes a long way too!
much like the clarisonic or something
the only thing i would say is that its not the best at removing tougher make up like mascara
so much more effective when you remove your makeup prior to using it
if you don't mind splurging a little bit for a lot of product
warning: this mask may be a bit harsh for some
because i like how intense it is
i feel like it really works to get super down into your skin more effectively than other masks i've tried
if you tough it out the end results are well worth it
thought putting the makeup on would make me break out even more
if you already have dry skin this might irritate you even more
this helped my skin so much!!!
i used it only one time so far.
after reading another review about how this mask is better than glamglow
i would give it more than 5 stars if possible!
i think i may even like it better than gg!
throw on a little bit
with a lot less clay
i suggest using a little bit every other week
although that may be my fault more than the product's fault
this product does "burn" a little bit for a very brief period
stings a little at first
you just need a little to have a good effect.
it still look oil less
the first difference he noticed is that the directions are even more geared to guys
his face is smoother than ever
leaves your skin feeling a bit smoother than before it went on
my pores tightened so much it seemed like some of them actually disappeared
which tends to be much oilier than the rest of my face
it actually helps clear up any little bumps on my face
the only downfall is that it squirts out too much product in the beginning
a little bit goes a long way
sensitive skin is so much better
after using it for a week i can say that my skin looks better
less red, less dry, and just better in general.
pretty much applied it diligently every night
this product is a little hard to get.
most others break me out
this is the first cleaner i've ever used that really cleans
is even more soothing
when combined with the scrub it works even better
also so much smoother
even though the price tag is a little high
i think the people that are finding this moisturizer too sticky or heavy are possibly using too much
so far so good.
some how it works
a little goes a long way.
there is so much product it will def last a long time
i decided that it was too expensive to give up on read a bit
found a little goes a long way
there is a decent amount of product for the price because a little goes a long way
pro:a little goes a long way
i don't have much of a problem with oil
a little goes a long way
not so much that it makes my skin greasy
as you never get that 'quenched' feeling as you would from a heavier product
a little goes a long way
it actually helps your makeup glide on easier because of it
i got a lot of uses out of the sample because a little goes a long way
i will go so far as to say this is my favourite moisturizer ever
i think it may be too much for the summer months
it actually does work as a primer too
i love it so much!
a tiny bit goes far.
it takes very little product
it's def better than many
wish there was a bigger bottle.
i feel like my skin is tighter and healthier.
a little bit goes a long way you barely need any product
more uses my skin just keeps feeling better
sure enough when using too much of this product for a couple days
my acne went away much faster than normal when switching back to the proper amount of this product
oh, and a little goes a long way!
when i used too much
this provided much better results!
the consistency is a little more solid than other moisturizers
i got a bit oilier than usual
love it even more
only use very minimal for whole face.
a little goes a very long way.
however it takes a little bit of smoothing over as its more of a paste than a cream
i imagine some other of its good points would diminish because of this
a little of this product goes a long way
a little goes a long way, too!
little bumps all over my face
nothing has worked for my skin as much as this has
much less than before
our skin tends to be more oilier than most races.
my skin feels younger for so long.
after 1 day of using this my skin has never looked better
my skin has a more even texture
of how much i need it now that my sample is gone
convincing myself it was too expensive
a little goes a long way
wow just wowowowowowow my dark circles got lighter my skin is 200 times smoother
a little goes a long way
others take a bit longer
it feels much smoother
i know it's a little on the pricier side
i love this so far
enjoyed those results so much that i had to go out
other products helped to fade them a little
it definitely helps it apply more smoothly
would like to use something that works a little faster at a better price point
maybe my expectations were too high.
have been using it for a little while now
but none of them works betther than this product.
be more even toned than it was with different serums
as far as dark spots
my skin just feels better when i use this.
it goes on so well
i'd still use it just because it makes my skin feel noticeably better
the tone of my skin was much more even
i can tell that my face looks better
why else is it so expensive
my skin is already noticeably better
it feels so much smoother
a little goes a long way with this product
my skin is brighter and even.
over the years my skin has gotten worse
some of my dark spots seem lighter
i get so many compliments
people have asked what i have done differently
my skin is so much more even in texture
ok more like all of them
my whole face also feels smoother
has made my complexion more even
definitely invest in this because it will change your skin for the better
it does a little time
they are much smaller/lighter
so far so good
now its pretty much gone
i couldn't be happier
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way so product lasts for awhile
it also seems to be making my moisturizer last a lot longer than it usually does
i noticed my makeup looking better when i use it compared to when i don't
even though i was told by a dermatologist that nothing short of aggressive
though i could probably use it more often because it definitely lives up to its name in being gentle
you only need to use a little bit each time
a lot goes no where so you do have to use a lot of product
they work just as well maybe better
which was a bit harsh
my skin has never felt more smooth
if i use it more often
my skin has never been better
didnt see much difference with my skin
a little bit goes a long way
i first used too much
it is not too harsh
've been having some trouble with my skin lately
using just a little bit of this product works wonders
its not too harsh
i feel that my skin is much cleaner
i am also finding my moisturizer seems to be absorbed better now as well
it smells way better than other products i've used
didn't think much about it till the next day my face looked much brighter
i no longer have a flaky look to my face.
a little goes a long way.
not too rough on my skin
isn't too rough on skin
not too harsh on my skin
actually a little too gentle
my skin looks tighter
so far my mom always go back to this.
i still have them but they are sooo much better!
it also dispenses alot so make sure when you use it just squeeze a little bit since it will be plenty enough
like the consistency of this product much better
overall i think it does a much better job of exfoliating
you don't need to use very much at a time
a little bit goes a long way
my acne looks a lot better to
oh - and a little bit goes a long way!
it has a smooth feel without being too gritty
i wouldn't recommend it for everyday nor for younger skin- it may be too harsh
not as tough as a scrub tougher than a cream cleanser
i find it too rough to use that often
the results so far
my eyes look much flatter!
it works at least as well and seems less sticky.
it's also quite a bit less expensive.
as far as eye creams go
t's even a bigger bummer to have to waste money on it
it didnt so much for dark circles for me
it took way too long to absorb
so far so good
no more dark circles
the area seems much less dark
so far so good
feel so much better for it
a little goes a long way as the consistency is lightweight
i hardly have a line around my eyes
it got better from there
a little does go a long way
though not good for dark circles
i think it is definitely a formula meant for more mature skin
a little goes a long way
which is nothing short of a miracle because i normally have awful bags under my eyes
works well there, too.
a little goes a long way
half a pump is more than enough for both eyes
one of my eyelids sags a little more than the other
mostly when i get tired of paying clarins high price
i know there are others more expensive
my eye area actually seems to look better
a little goes a long way
also, a little goes a loooooooong way.
well this winter played so much havoc around my eyes
crows feet that were just getting deeper
you do need to apply a little bit more compare to normal eye cream
it's even better than i remembered.
it is hard to justify spending this much money on an eyecream
hopefully i find an amazing product for way less than this one
skin is generally looking a little brighter
nothing even comes close
it's a lot better than paying $225
i just wish it was more product is all
it does what it says and lasts a long time.
the only criticism is that they could give a little more warning that you are about to run out
it is has more product than some others
other areas of my face feel much firmer
always have been to some extent
its a little on the heavy side
overall it cost too much for something that doesn't work as advertised
so when i smile i dont see as much creeping
even after a tough day
shadows and liquid liner go on much better now.
they've done nothing to improve the dispenser
i now use only clarins products on my face--stick with the restorative line if you are getting a bit older
this goes on so smooth
tighter after using for a little while
it took a bit longer for me to see great results.
it takes the little lines under my eyes away more than anything else i have tried
not nearly as much as i hope
a little goes a long way, and it absorbs quickly.
i think i see improvement-better than other products i tried
it last quite a long time also
it's expensive, but a little goes a long way.
though not as much as i would like for the price
as if getting older wasn't hard enough
those 'tell-all' lines around my eyes have definetly gotten lighter
couldn't be happier with my purchase.
i like the total eye concentrate even better
a little goes a long long way
though this product may be more expensive than others
it lasts quite a while
is one of those little luxuries that has become a necessity
although it seems a bit spendy
it lasts a really long time
a little goes a long way
i love this product so much.
a little goes a long way
i just looks so much better
by so many people
i love it so much more than any other actual face primer i have used
everyone seems to notice the difference too.
also makes it easier to go without foundation or tinted promer on the weekends when i dont want to wear very much makeup
every time i use it the results get better.
and it's much brighter and smoother.
as much as i can
find it better for the summertime
i think i probably smooth it in more than i should
i don't like it as much as benefit's porefessional
makes it wear better
i try to get as much usage as i can
definitely must pat it on, rather than rub.
have found nothing that even matches this for my more mature skin
my face looks tighter
just go with a powder this definitely keeps my powder makeup looking fresher longer
my makeup looks better when i have it on
my problem skin seems to look better since i started using
it makes it look better
my face looks better for those 10 hours with the balm
i looks so much more bright and looks younger!
this would make more of a difference in brightening an already nice complexion
if only it was a little cheaper because i have gotten in a habit of putting it on several times a day
as in i kept using it day after day since i liked it so much
even better after lack of sleep
it goes a long way
they all seem to be more hype/less results
seems to stay-the-day better
a little goes a long way when applying.
don't feel the tightening sensation much
us older gals look so much better with a tad of make up
probably more of the entire clarins skin care line
much less make up
it makes my make-up last so much longer
it gets better every time i use it.
it goes make my skin look brighter
seems to make my foundation last longer
also a little bit goes a long way
the good news is that flash works so well that makeup stays in place
a bit pricey, but it will last a long time.
my face does look a bit brighter
just overall prettier when i use this
i love it so much
there is no more explanation needed!!
it just makes my skin look better
it may burn a bit
on more than one occasion i have been told how rested i look
even though things like this are hard to measure
there is no better morning wake-up call.
my face felt better
my make up stayed on much longer
even my breakouts are way less.
my face has never felt better
my face is looking healthier
making it so my foundation stays longer on my skin
i love it so much
now after two more i can tell the pores around my nose are getting smaller
because it dried my skin out so much it did cause me to break out
it's working so far
a little goes a long way
it probably would be rough on combitation skins.
my skin looks less shiny and much more pretty !!
not as much as i had hoped
i like this product because so far
my pores have definitely gotten smaller
the only reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the smell is a little strong
my pores are definitely smaller too.
this is the first product that wasn't so strong it made the problem worse
i need something a little more more moisturing than their lotion
the mattifying lotion were enough to make my skin look not just clearer
my face is fresher looking
i even get more compliments
a little goes a long way
all i know is it looks better
my skin is definitely much cleaner
they seem to go away faster
i keep it far enough away
i will probably try others that are a better cost for the size
it is expensive but a little goes a long way.
iit should be used with the lotion to get even better results
love the proes no more cleanser
acne got much much worse
this has helped so much to help them hide better
it would have gotten 5 stars if the scent was less intense
t's pores no more line makes a big difference-pores really look smaller
nothing has ever worked as well as pores no more
i like this cleanser so far
my pores look somewhat smaller
which it didnt seem to have much effect on
5 oz sounds like not very much product for a fair amount of money
the two in combo seems to work good so far
t was breaking out quite a bit
so well on my skin
makes my makeup look better
don't apply too much though
not too heavy, not too light
it's much more smooth
a little of this goes a long way
my review is pretty much the same
anyway my skin is clearly and pore seems smaller.
not only do my pores appear much smaller
have found nothing that even compares to this
like it very much.
a little certain goes a long way
it is a little pricy but lasts a long time.
love the proes no more cleanser
love the proes no more cleanser
this works great could be a bit better
my skin is softer than it has been in years
needs a little moisturizer something or other
my skin look so much better
this "pores no more" line has been great
does seem to have helped a bit
my skin needs a little something stronger
my skin feels better
love it so far
which is rather strong
this is the only one that has even kind of made a difference
this also helped even out my skin tone
i mean this stuff is already expensive...jeesh!
a smell none the less
my face now looks smoother now
however it is not heavy at all
a little product goes a long way.
couldn't be happier with the results
a little goes a long way
i normally would have a hard time spending so much on one product
i would give this product more than 5 stars if i could
i love this so much.
made my skin so much more clear
it's a little pricey, but it lasts a long time.
that just made it sting worse
my skin no longer felt tight
the cooling feeling can last very long
my face no longer felt tight
this always prevents peeling if i've stayed out too long
in the summer it makes a tan last so much longer if used daily
it saved my fair skinned friend better than anything else
which helped my skin feel muuuuch better/less painful
my face feels much better
i think that's from other products rather than this
when ever i see that i am a little bit pink from being in the sun i use this
$15 cheaper for five times as much product
burn easily no matter how much spf i wear
some kind of skin trouble- iches
this gel works much better than other drugstore after-sun gels that he's tried in the past
use sparingly until you know how much you need!
i've come to appreciate this even more than i did previously
makes the burn hurt less somehow
it's perfect for those days you spend too much time in the sun
actually use it even when i haven't been out in the sun
perfect for summer when a thicker cream may be a bit too much
no more itch no more discomfort
it's a must after a little to much sun
the burning was too much to bear
less so than other things i would typically use
it hurt so bad
would get 5 stars if price was a little lower.
so far pretty good
it actually makes my skin seem healthier.
it hurt so much.
it made it feel so much better
i love how it feels on skin after too much sun
which is no longer made :
a little goes a long way.
this was a much better experience
my only complaint is that it should have a bit of pain reliever as well
so much better than the drugstore gel i was using
it took so much heat out of the burn
as a very fair person who gets red if i'm in direct sunlight for more than 20 minutes
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way.
a little bit goes a long way so even though it's a tiny tub
this cream has evened out the texture so much
that you only need a little to get the job done
but other than that it's great!
it's significantly less expensive than my old moisturizer
i've used it 3 times so far
it goes on so smooth
this product is just so remarkably effective: i've never used anything that comes close
the price seems like a lot
considering that there are many face creams out there that cost twice as much
'm more apt to use it in the winter than the summer
this is a thick cream so a little goes a long way
for me it is better suited for spring
nothing feels better than putting this on after a shower
because of its thick consistency: a little goes a long way
decided it would probably be better for my mom who has drier skin
i tried it out as she claimed it to be "so good" compare to many other creams
i do think it might be too heavy for summer
a little goes a long way.
other than that, i love it.
prefer something more on mild side
so far so good.
its a rich balm so a little goes a long way.
spreads out even better
you can cover your whole face with a lot less product
my pores are much more visible even though i use good primer
it was just a tad much for my oily t-zone area
switched to this one cuz it was too expensive
a little bit goes a long way
have a difficult time finding lotions that are thick enough to actually do something without being too heavy on my skin
a little bit goes a long way
so far this has been a great moisturizer to wear over night
no complaints so far.
i like this very much
the fragrance is a bit stronger than i'd like
a little goes a long ways.
very little covers a lot of area
a little goes a long way.
goes well under makeup too since it absorbs well.
it is a little heavy, but not too heavy.
i generally use this at night because it can be a little heavy
sephora goes out of stock too often
a little goes a very long way!
a little heavy for the summer
), and says his skin has never felt better.
which is why he probably gravitated toward this br
so he hasn't been as badly bothered by it as he used to be
because i'm trying to get him to take better care of his skin
i think i use it as much or more than he does
overall my skin looks much better
although it hasn't made anything worse
makeup goes on well over it.
this cream has helped my skin heal from acne blemishes so much faster than before
for many years i've never used any moisturizer since it only makes my skin more oily
my skin looks better and glows so much.
as i've gotten older i've noticed that my skin just wasn't getting enough rejuvenation while i slept
i've found that a little bit goes a long way- one tube of this stuff lasts me 3 months with nightly application
i just use a little
i still have the majority of the tube left so while it is a little expensive it lasts
my skin feel so much better
more younger looking skin
this one seems more greasy than previous purchases
i am willing to pay the cost cus my complexion looks so much better
when i think of how much i have spent on moisturizers in the past
a little lighter than i expected.
i think i will want something lighter for summer
i think continued use will just make it even better
i tried a less expensive one with poor results
i love it so much i wear it night and day!
a little goes a long way
most things either overdry my skin or make the breakouts worse
although it is a bit pricey
gives light oil look little bit goes a long way
the only reason for 4 stars is because it can get a bit greasy if over applied
definitely don't need too much.
a little on the expensive side
a little goes a long way
even though my foundation has spf
i tried it as well
because it's so $$ i usually mix it with my skinmd to help it last longer
it stop it from getting worse
also, a little goes a long way!
makeup goes on well over it.
a little goes a long way so you can get a lot of uses out of one tube
a little goes a long way
it is a bit on the pricey side
you don't have to use very much at a time- a little bit goes a long way
hope you like this moisturizer as much as i do!
it feels light, but does a heavy job.
couldn't be happier with it
will probably be too light for winter
haven't used it long enough to test that or to see if it improves skin clarity
it was feeling a little heavy
my skin looks better
no matter how much spf i put on
loved it so much
the better my skin gets
have my face feeling much smoother
i did have to wait a bit longer to put my makeup on
its done just that
i will know better when we get into summer when i start to sweat more
have been using some pretty aggressive treatments to get rid of it
a very good product for the money as i have purchased it a couple of times
so a little goes a long way
my skin has never looked better or felt softer.
a little dab goes a long way
it is so light
it is so light
my skin never looked better
my skin tone even looks mird even and brighter.
never realized this product makes me skin produce more acne
use only a little bit otherwise it doesn't absorb well
my face got a lot better after using it over a month
i find this to be a little more drying than a comparable clinique version i sometimes use
so far i like it
i don't know how much it really helps with long lasting brightening effects
i think it's fading my hyperpigmentation faster than it would on its own
the more you add water the more it foams which is really interesting
i took a star off because i think the price is too high for a rather basic
a little goes a long way.
more importantly looks brighter
a little really goes a long way.
even my little break outs that i get have gone away
trust me a little goes a long way
it might be a little pricey
a little goes a long way
if used more then every other day it dries your skin out too much
a little dollop 'goes a long way
it seems a tad bit different than it use to be
and a little goes a long way.
she liked it so much that she took it home with her
now, i'd better go get another tube.
i like this and a little goes a long way!
i look way younder too
plus it lasts way longer
so far i like the other part of the series.
they actually irritated my face more
a little goes a long way
as far as cleansers go...it is ok.
it last a long time because just a little bit goes a long way
i might just replace my usual cleanser with this
my skin has never looked better
my skin has never looked better
maybe my skin just has to adjust to it
i love this it has improved my skin by 80% in a very short time
since using this it has gotten much better
more even skin toned
i just use a thicker moisterizer afterwards
i wish it had a little better scent to it though.
the texture of the skin will feel better by the next morning
which means that i switch to something lighter during the summer months
he loved it so much
he did think the price was a little steep for lotion
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way
it's expensive but works just as well (to me!)
a little goes a long way.
as far as the wrinkle fighting power of the product
the skin on my face was so much more softer
they have noticeably gotten much smaller
more showing up everyday
not so much for the wrinkles
a little goes a long way
would be that it was easier to put make up over
so far so good
so far so good.
my skin looks better than it has in years.
it is suited me better that murad's night cream.
a little goes a long way
i almost didnt' buy it because it seemed a bit expensive
this works better than many other products i've used
it is so much cheaper than some of the bigger name br
i get some more
my mother always said prevention is better than intervention
i no longer felt the benefits of the cream
so far so good
my skin is much smoother
i even think my make-up goes on better.
a little pricey for me being on a very fixed income
are only a little more than halfway through it
because a little goes a long way
more firm which obviously i love
seems like it will last quite awhile too.
i like it so far
a little goes a long way!
a little goes a long way.
my eyelids are 10 times better
you don't need much so it will last a long time.
a very small amount goes a long way too
it has worked better than many other products
a little goes a long way
so far so good
one of my eyes looked bigger than the other
my lids which i thought always seemed darker than the rest of my complexion
looks so much better
so far it seems to be working well for me.
she gave me such little sample that i had to go back to ask for more
a little goes a long way
probably not as much as if i had surgery
it may seem a bit pricy for what you get
i am 27 years old so my skin is still in relatively good condition
and you better believe i'm tired.
a little bit goes a long way with this product.
also very little goes along way definitely getting your money's worth
it seemed to make my dark circles worse
though i might switch around a bit
see if there are any i like better
i like this cream better than the others i have used
i look younger and healthier!
i think my wrinkles have gotten better
still gets the job done
this is the only one to fix up the little lines too
which happens every so many years
a little goes a long way
i feel like my eyes look so much more fresh
i think the dark circles look better than when i first bought this
so far this one is pretty good
my only problem is that even though it says you can use it above the eye as well
other than that it works really well.
it is better than other eye creams i have tried
a little bit is all you need,
my fine lines are better
little bumps around the eyes
my dark circles are so much lighter
it is a little pricey though.
the price is a little much for me
when you consider how little you use
it does seem to last a long time
he has more experience with eye creams then i do
find most do nothing for my under eye skin
do i like it better than my usual all about eyes?
this is better than most i've tried
better than anything i've ever tried!!
it is a little thicker than most eye creams i have used
the results were not significantly better than most other eye creams from sephora
my under eyes feel so much smoother
loved it so much that i will continue to buy.
personally i'm getting better results than origins
it is maybe a little thicker than other creams
i need more out of an eye cream than i once did
this one did all i hoped for and more.
i've tried so many things
i don't have to spend much time on my make-up-- especially my once troublesome eye area
i typically don't want to spend more than $30 on any face cream
i seem more awake
i don't have much problems there
i just hate how expensive it is...
it's more than just a "renewing" eye cream.
which means you have a more plump
so since it has retinol make sure you don't get it too close to the eye
i think this brightens better
you have more mature skin :
at least 6 months because a little goes a long way with this product
if there is a better one out there
since it is rather pricey
i just look better than before
it does make my eyes some what brighter
they sure have faded a lot
the better the chance of irritation
does seem to slightly improve my very dark circles
they were getting worse
i find that less than 1 pump is more than enough for both eyes
which is more than i can say for 90% of the eye creams out there
the murad resurgence eye cream is far better than the others i've tried
i usually use something stronger at night.
normally i wouldn't pay this much for a beauty product
so far im liking it very much.
a little seems to go a long way
have more than fine wrinkles
have a lot of money to spend on one
i might get something a little richer for before bed
diminishing the dark circles took a little bit longer though
even though i've only used it for a week so far i can tell a difference
have gotten remarks about how i look less tired
the circles under my eyes seem much lighter
even on those days with little sleep
a little goes a long way
i wish they sold a smaller bottle for half so that more could try it
they feel moisturized more now even though i was previously using a moisturizer
so far so good, only had it a few days,
which get less so throughout the day
i just look more well rested.
haven't been using it long enough to see any difference in my dark circles however
and a little goes a long way.
the skin around my eyes looks much younger
my eye makeup looks better
a little goes a long way
i think it had some effect on my fine lines as well
works when my skin is feeling just a little drier than usual
as far as this moisturizer goes
i've had to buy 2 more since because he likes it so much
4 stars for being good so far
and not the usual greasy normal.
i leave it on my skin for more than 20 minutes
my skin is so much smoother
it did make my skin a bit smoother
definitely helps after you somewhat recovered from the peel already
it was lighter and tighter.
needs a little pick me up
because it's so gentle i can leave it on for quite a bit longer
it made it feel a bit softer
winter always makes it 10x worse
i only used this once so far, but its great.
the feeling doesn't last too long
the gel is a little hard to get off
it was easy to take off as well
look better for it
not only does it make my skin brighter
it's a little stickier than i'd prefer
it lasts a long time too.
this relatively inexpensive mask is a great little treatment for dry winter skin or skin that just needs a little boost
as soon as i washed it off my mom said my skin look significantly brighter
a little goes a long way
is clear like that too
my skin was angrier than ever
yeah this mask might seem like it is expensive
this mask does so much at such great price.
i've only tried it once so far
it stings a little bit when you first put it on
many much more expensive facial masks i have tried do not have the same effect
though does not make my skin more oily than it already is
my skin feels and looks so much better after use.
even though it only says 20 mins or so
a little goes a long way
i think it was actually more rich then my skin needed
it is very thick and a little goes a long way.
it has helped my skin so much that i no longer wear foundation makeup
a little goes a long way
this one i love so far
hope this helps with the deeper lines i'm starting to see from
heavier than i would apply in the morning
the cost is a little high
thought the cream might be too rich for me
actually made my skin smoother
i like it very much
he thought i could be no older than 33
my makeup goes on well
i only wish there were a lighter version of this for the summer
this helps so much, and the foundation glides on.
this cream is thick - a little goes a long way.
i like this better than "unwrinkle".
i think my skin looks smoother since using these products
i am using this as a moisturizer more than anything else
so noting to dislike as far as smell
this so far has been a great moisturizer
it is also a good base for makeup seeming to hold the makeup on face longer
so a little goes a long way
it makes me a little red
a lttle goes a long way.
very light and a little goes a long way!
many comment on how well my skin looks.
it might b better it there is abit of spf
i hardly have to put much on
feels it all day long
my skin looks brighter and smoother too!
it does work as far as plumping the skin
i only need to use a little bit
even though i will continue to search for better as i always do
are much shorter in duration
my face hasn't looked this good in a long time.
i hope to see more results the longer i use the product
my concealer looked better than it has in years!
my only complaint is that it is so darn expensive
many more expensive than this one
seems to improve the texture too
thus far i have not seen a big improvement in the lines
do think the skin around them looks much better
not so much under my eye
my makeup goes on so much easier
that it could be thicker
because a little goes a long way for both eyes
the longer i use them, the better the results.
my crows feet have become deeper
fine lines around my eye area are getting worse.
too early to see if it has made any difference with my wrinkles
it does sting a bit if i get it too close to the lash line
i've noticed results in my fine lines in a very very short time
you get twice as much product as you would from other that don't even work
every so often i try other
not greasy at all and a little goes a long way.
a little goes a long way
so far so good
it still works amazing even though i don't use it twice a day
this has even had me look for more of his products to try
while i'm getting a few little line
this one is better than any thing i have ever used before
work well have notice the difference
within a week of using this my eyes looked even better than they did before
my eyes look much better than girls of 20
they are so much better
i could not be happier
i've tried too many to count
it works as well as la mur but costs much less.
a little bit goes a long way
decided it was time to try out a more expensive product
i can actually see them getting a little less deep
very little goes a long way.
besides, a little goes a long way.
doesn't take much, so it lasts a long time.
make skin more tight
have also been trying to get more sleep so don't know if that's adding improvement
how much i love it
it doesn't surprise me that results so far on my 'mature' skin have been minimal
i do think i see slightly shorter
a little pricey but a little goes a long way.
my makeup applies so much smoother now
was worried this would be too heavy
i couldn't be happier with this product.
a little goes a long way.
my makeup is staying in place much longer
a little bit goes a long way so you don't have to use a lot of it on your face
the product lasts longer
looking way way better
the sephora employee steered her away from that because she thought it would irritate my skin more than anything
so far it hasn't broken me out
during the winter you might need a heavier moisturizer than this lighter one
if it gets too old
i did so much research
my skin looks better than it has in a long time.
also, a little goes a long way!
i love this one so much more!
a little bit goes pretty far.
a little goes a very long way.
it just makes me skin so much softer
makes my makeup look 100x better than with any other moisturizer i have ever used
it also lasts a long time, you don't need a lot.
i love it so far!
a little goes a long way with this.
it may feel a little bit oily when first applied
i only use it as a day cream- i find i need something a bit heavier at night
perfect for those months when you need a little extra moisture
i can imagine that it might be too much for a day cream in the summer
a little seems to go a long way
sometimes when i use the pomegranate i end up using too much product because it is so light
i felt like i needed to use too much of this product for it to be really cost effective
i find it becoming oilier faster then it would when i started using it
perhaps the formula has changed in this?
even though my skin gets a little slick
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way
even after i stopped using accutane i found that this really helps in the winter when my skin needs a little extra help
it is a little more watery than most creams
fairly lucky with not too many wrinkles
love this so far!!
a little goes a long way
even though i may try different br
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way too
it's cheaper than many other eye creams i've tried
the brightening is so nice i barely need to use any
i didn't know how much better this cream is until i stopped using it for a while in my quest to find something better
my skin is much softer
under my eyes looks much better
a little goes a long way
make your face feel that much smoother
even though the lines are not deep
i feel like this has more than outdone itself
i like this better for my eye area than a high end br
my lines look so much better
my lips look so much fuller when i do remember
i never get that itchy burning feeling when you get a little too close to the lash line
nothing better for eyes!
a little goes a long way!
a little goes a long way.
although better than what i was previously using
nothing better for eyes and lips .
some much more expensive than this
i love this eye cream so much
don't use too much
be a little more patient
i only gave it 4 stars because i prefer a cream that is easier to smooth on
as it gets warmer outside it is still just as nice
it's just as good or even better than with it
just pat a little under the eyes
a little goes a long way.
feel a whole lot better on a normal given day
i've tried other eye creams that are less expensive in years gone by
need a little help in the under eye
a little bit goes a long way.
my skin is so much softer since i've started using this
was that a little goes a long way
even using just once a day has made my skin look fresher
a little goes a long way.
it goes a long way
i prefer it far more than the liquid soap.
it was better off not using anything than to cleanse
my skin has never looked better
like way more than a normal person
my make up stays fresh for much longer
it lasts so much longer than the liquid version.
i find the new soap dish much better than the old style
usually have good results with them
that are way more expensive
it dried my skin out way too much
it improved my skin sooo much!
so far it has worked well
i actually like this better because it lasts longer
i liked the other dish better.
so more than 20 years
while it is pricey for soap i feel it's well worth it because my skin also feels less tight
is much more cooling to the face
even better used with my clairsonic.
this is better than proactive because it's cheaper
what i like about it the most is that it gets rid of all make up
which made it even worse
i am more than satisfied with this product: it is big
hasn't had any problems with it so far
lasts for a very long time
think the bar will last much longer than the liquid face wash does
it is a great product & it lasts a long time too.
i tried to switch to something that was cheaper
my skin has looked better now than it ever has
i think the bar cleanses much better
i like it so much
i've tried so many different face washes
not too greasy and spreads well and far.
it’s just that he prefers the other better
it provides just the right amount of moisture without being too much
i hope results get better
for winter, the cream would be better.
have not experienced any problems thus far
it's been about 2 weeks, so far so good!
all around much firmer
much cheaper than most products at sephora
that was made worse by any makeup i put on it
which could be worse
a little goes a long way with this product.
i see this lasting 6-8 months easily so thats great when you consider the price is a lot less than comparable eye creams
it hasn't done much for my circles
i look a little less tired in the morning
texture is a little too thick for my liking
my skin looks so much smoother.
it seems that my eyelids are even more sensitive then the rest of me
it takes very little
this may be better
it's much cheaper than many eye creams i've tried
a little goes a long way
i am not sure if i notice much difference between the two except that the all about eyes comes in a bigger pot
hope to see more improvement there
even though it is a thicker cream than i've used before
a little goes a long way
i like it better than anything else i've tried.
it's getting less and less everyday.
love it so far
so far i love it
if you apply too much
makes the area under the eye look better
so far, i really like this cream.
a little goes a long way
haven't been using too long
will need more time to see what it does for wrinkles
so far so good
nothing else works better.
they'd gone away so gradually i didnt even realize it
i look less tired
i'd rather it come in a pump
i might use a little less during the summer since it is a rich cream
it's the only thing has worked well enough for the deep undereye wrinkles i started getting from hectic months of work
the skin around my eyes feels so much smoother
as i am 27 i figured i'd better be proactive about ageing
as soon as it is applied it makes most fine lines seem to disappear or at least look alot less noticeable
as far as it helping to make them go away
so far i love it
figured i might need something a little more heavy duty
are you getting more sleep?
so far i really like it
you don't to apply too much as it is a bit dense yet that is the way firming creams are supposed to be
a little goes a long way, too.
only a little dab is needed
my eyes do look smoother
i do feel a little more cushion
i don't have much to compare this cream too.
free of the little bumps
working pretty good so far
he looks much younger
i love how much cleaner my skin feels after using this product
it does burn a little when you put it on
can work as a spot treatment too.
this product works so well that the 3
5 will be better for guys with normal-oily skin
i just wanted to point out to those of you leaving less than stellar reviews for reasons being
a little goes a long way also.
maybe a little more if you're wearing a lot of makeup
it does just as much of a crazy cleaning on them too
a little bit goes a long way
my skin has never been better
how long it lasts
this has really helped my skin become more clear
a little bit goes a long way
i find myself reaching for this whenever i've had a heavier day of makeup
i feel like there is still a lot more to use
there isn't much on there
a little bit goes a long way.
a little goes a long way
the product lasts a very long time
a little goes a long way
it has helped with that so much
as a face wash i find this way too harsh
it pretty much got
i live it so much.
just a little bit goes a long way.
does the job well.
i found that a little goes a long way.
mostly because the instructions say so
oh, and a little goes a long way.
i no longer have to worry since i have found this product
i can see where it might be too much for others
since it may be too stripping for some
my skin has never felt better
it also only takes a tiny bit because it lathers so much
clinique better keep this in the line because it is my cleanser from now on
my husband actually uses it too!
he hardly has break outs now.
the only small detail i can think of that i'd like to see improved is that this cleanser can be a bit drying
a little goes a long way
couldn't find anything better
a little of this product goes a lonngggg way.
a little goes along way
this is gentler on my skin than the st
a little goes a long way so a tube last me long time
complexion have not looked better
i also really like that a little goes a long way with this product
nothing works as well as this
this also lasted me like 8 months because a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way because of all the foam.
however if you accidentally use too much
it is super foamy so a little goes a long way!
my skin was never better or more clear
it's takes a little longer than i'd prefer to wash off
a little goes a long way
can see this lasting for a long time
the skin around my eyes has never looked better
on a good day i look like your average slightly tired student
it is a little pricey
it's much better value than a lot of the eye creams i've been seeing around
a little goes a long way so it lasts forever!
this is the only one so far that leaves my 24 year old under eye area feeling like
longer than any other 'primer' out there
how little i need to use to get the job done
i would probably go for something stronger
returned it because it made my eyes look older than what i am
it's better than nothing
a little goes a long way so the price is on point
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way so it will last.
a little goes a long way.
however i find my eyes more puffy when i use it
none seem to work so quickly
however, now i appreciate it way more!!
a little goes a long way
if you're thinking "it's too expensive" just know that a little bit goes a long way
i think i put too much on
every one i have tried has either been too greasy
it worked much better than the thick
so far, so good!
surprisingly don't have many fine lines anyway--
lack of sleep definitely make eye bags worse
i look less tired
if it's already more effective than months of using other creams/serums i imagine it'll improve even more
love this one better than the "rich" version.
so far i've had no complaints
very little is needed so it lasts forever.
i don't have much problems around my eye area
i could see my eyes being a lot less puffier next morning when i wake up
so far so good
have never loved one as much as this
it does smooth out the fine lines so that my makeup goes on much better
no matter how much sleep i get
have tried many more eye creams
he never thought much about skin protectors
so far so good i think.
personally i wish the spf was a little higher
it seemed to work well
the price point was just a little too high
definitely going back for more!
so far i like how it feels on my skin
i like that this one has spf too.
s is twice as much
it still good enough to keep his skin from getting flaky
a little goes a long way!
he also said the other feels lighter on his skin
he would rather stick with it
i've had trouble finding a moisturizer that works as well as this does under makeup
makes my skin look much healthier
a little goes a long way
so far so good.
this one is a bit too light for winter
it’s just that he prefers the other better
just a little goes a long way
way more than any decent moisturizer in this price range
figured i'd splurge for him a little
this is the "man version" of that product more or less
his skin has never been better
i also think that eventhough you can probably find something cheaper
a little bit goes a long way
a little goes a long way
he said it was too heavy
says that his skin is so much better since he started using this product
because it gets even worse
it even seemed to help with breakouts as well
the only problem i have is that its a bit pricey because it takes 2
it's so inexpensive and a little goes a long way.
she says that this moisturizer goes a long way
until i find something i like more
also, it lasts quite a while.
either many of my moisturizers have too much oil
i couldn't be happier with the result i have received with this product
my skin has never looked better.
i love it so much.
my tone is even
my red areas have been so much less red since using this product
this was everything i wanted and more.
how a little goes a long way
lately have really been struggling to keep it moisturized without resorting to a heavy
in the winter i might need a little boost here
however you will need something heavier during the winter
a little goes a long way
my skin has never been better
a little goes a long way so the price point is not too terrible
skin texture has improved so much
my makeup not only goes on much easier
a little goes a long way- i use about half a pump for my whole face
many bad picture days i finally found this
i just wish it was a little more hydrating or else it would be perfect
though i would suggest something heavier before bed
none have helped my oil like this one
goes on easier than the lotion
it works better for me than lots of expensive ones
i just make sure to use a heavier moisturizer at night
so far i approve.
i wish it were quite so expensive
$62 for as much as you get in this pot isn't enough
too high of a price point for me to actually buy
worried it might make my acne worse
my skin tone looks a lot more even
this just made it 100 times better
my sample has been lasting me quite a while
i love that you can also leave it on for way longer than 5
i love the smell of it so much
it is a little more slimy than i like
probably because it is so pleasant to use
couldn't be happier with it
helped me relax more than any other mask i have tried
it may be a little expensive
will just produce more oils
i feel it is a little bit overpriced
i like this product very much.
a little doe go a long way
my skin is definitely much softer after a week of use
it spreads really well so you only need a finger dabs worth which is great cause it'll last pretty long depending on how often you use it
sometimes even in the summer
that whole jar can last you well over a year even with constant use
definitely more cucumber than rose
however, it is all it says and more!
i love this mask more than any other.
it'll also last so long because you really don't need that much product
i'll usually use it before a night out because it makes my makeup go on so much better
it depends on how much hydration i need
just wished it wasn't so expensive
a little goes a long way
i love this mask so much.
i like it better than the murad face peel.
the tone was significantly more even
my face just looked more balanced
it goes so far
not too heavy or too light
i just wish it was a little cheaper.
not only does my face look more clear
so light that its good to use in summer too
every lancome product i use makes me more
its perfect other then its quite pricey
this one is just lighter
alittle bit goes a long way.
so one bottle lasts for quite a long time
a little goes a long way
even though i buy him a cheaper kind
it turn out to be quite good so far
a little goes a long way.
i actually like this better than lancome's absolu
the scent is much heavier than the bienfait
because it's a little lighter on the skin
my only dislike is that my skin needs a little extra moisture during the winter months
rather than just spf 15
a little goes a long way.
its a bit thick so you don't need to use as much
so my makeup goes on smoother
i will still have many more uses
i love this just as much
its a little too light for my skin in the winter time
perhaps a bit too much so for oily skin or in summer
no need to put on a lot, a little does the trick.
i've only needed a little bit every day
his skin has never looked better
i've used better but paid a lot more.
one other thing i love is how much of the product you get for the price
this is better than my prescription stuff my skin was flawless after my 12 hour shift
just a little goes along way too!
it felt a little too "active" for me
a little can get the job done
said it made his acne better
trust me hes a little generous with the product too
but i see this lasting a good 5 months.
which also makes it easier for him to shave in the mornings
it kind of stings a little, in a good way.
i dont like to use it more than once a day.
this has done none of that
i always have a little trouble seeing
is better for the environment
a little goes a long way
i love it so much.
i love it so much!
and a little goes a long way.
you don't need a lot of product so while it seems expensive
so far i like this the most out of everything i've tried
this works so well
it comes with so much product
and a little goes a long way.
a little goes a long ways for this product
which can be a lot
i find myself still using the wipes over this because they are more convenient
a little goes a long way
i end up comparing it to this one because it just works so well
a little goes a long way.
thought it was worth a try too see how much my makeup was removed with ease
it would make use easier
it only takes a little
and just a little goes a long way.
gets every product i have off of my skin with little effort
it's better to spend money on something that works than cheap drugstore br
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way for me
it makes my night time routine way easier.
works better than all of them
i mean nothing has come close to this it has taken even the most stubborn of makeup off without scrubbing or going over the same areas more than once
a little goes a long way, so it'll last a while
a little goes a long way too.
you only need a little.
idk that's waaayyy longer than i expected
a little goes such a long way
if anything, my skin looks better.
less is better when it comes to my skin type
was worried this would be too much for my skin
actually i fell like it adds more moisture into it
it takes makeup off so well
my skin has felt a lot softer after using it
you need to be a little generous when you use it
you need just a little
so that with long-term use you will slow down aging
you only need a little bit each time.
the better my skin gets
it is a bit heavier than my hydrator
its still not that heavy
i don't notice too much of a difference in my under eye area
as far as keeping the area from getting dry it does the job quite well
this under cream seems to have improved this a little
so far, so good.
how so many people get this "into" their eyes
they must be using too much or just not paying attention to application
the only thing that could make this better is it it came in a tube or pot
so none of the h
it's thicker than most
others might have better results.
i can say that it has helped me look a bit younger
already my undereye circles look so much better
my make-up has been fine too
since it's rather expensive
there is a lot of product
firming i don't notice that as much
it is expensive but lasts a long time.
a little bit goes a long way
i love it so much that i use it all over my face.
haven't been using it long enough to claim it is firming
i don't look 20 years younger yet
there might be more benefits
it definitely does not diminish fine lines by much at all
the puffiness looks better yet i expect it will continue to improve as time goes by
need i say more??
prevents them from getting worse that's good enough for me
though not as high as some others
a little goes a long way
i like this product very much.
sun protection is a great benefit even though only 15
the puffiness is so much better
as soon as i dab on a little
you only need a little bit, not a full pump.
it did seem to burn a little when i first started using it
more like a cream than a serum or fluid- so a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way
it will sting quite a bit.
it actually helped clear some of my acne as well.
i feel like it runs out quicker
i think per ounce the smaller one might be a better deal anyway??
what's even better is that you can use just one pump of product for your whole face
i even use my clarisonic way less than before
maybe it was just this bottle too
it's also very difficult to take out the product when the liquid inside only have a few left
a little really does go a long way
better product for less than half the price
a little goes a long way.
this cleanser really does clean my skin so much better than any other cleansers i've tried
this actually cleared my skin faster
switched to this one because its less expensive
it lasts forever and a little goes a long way.
however it takes a toll on my skin to change so often
my skin is complicated to say the least.
it seems so light that i hardly imagined it would work
i do think it is a bit pricey
would have preferred a little less
after more than 20 years of trying anything
i could not be happier
for less than $20 i think that is amazing.
my skin has definitely gotten clearer
i love this product so much!
lathers up well with only a little bit of product
so finding a face wash that gets the job done without making the issues worse has been difficult
a little goes a very long way
less break-out prone
it only got worse
my skin is already in better shape after just 4 days of using this along with other clinique products
my skin has been so much better since i started using thsi
only ever so slightly
i love this face soap so much.
it is well balanced, at least i think so.
the mild is a little bit tight
maybe you can use two cleaner mild
one pump actually gives me too much product
it started to be too harsh
i prefer a little more foaming action
so this one gets the job done well
this hasn't done much to help that
my skin has never felt better
in the spring/summer i'm usually a little more oily
it lasts me quite a long time too.
my skin feels much softer
i feel so much better
need i say more.
after using this product my skin got so much better
my skin still feels a little tight afterwards
it prevents my face from getting oily throughout the day better than any other primer ive ever used
this primer really kept my face matte for a longer time than usual
my makeup looks smoother and lasts twice as long.
i think it's better than the benefit porefessional 100%
this definitely blurs pores better than any other primer i've tried
nothing really helped until i found thins
it makes makeup stay longer
i love this so much!
lasts longer than any mat primer i have tried
i remember i loved it sooo much that i tried using it sparingly to make my sample last longer
even though it is also mattifying
anyway, pores no more does a great job so far.
more expensive too at $52 per bottle
wanted something that'd mattify my face a bit more
the product goes a long way.
a little goes a long way
maybe dab a little more product where i'm shining through
a little product can stretch a long way
this is way better
a little does go a long way
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way
love it even more
it's way better than the benefit pores no more stuff
the woman working convinced me to spend a little more
i still have my smashbox primer
my makeup goes on flawless now too!
because it just worked better
so why not?it has a much different texture
so that isn't so much of an issue
controls oil better than anything i've ever tried
a little on the pricey side
it adds a more finished look to my face as well.
it definitely makes my pores look smaller
a little goes a long ways so the product does last
so far this is my go to primer
making pores look much smaller
was unable to find one that would do a better job than benefit's porefessional
even if you want a fresher "no makeup" look
it wasn't making anything worse
6 hours of doing physical work in warmer than i would like ac
i generally need something more hydrating than this
a little goes a long way.
works really well slowly my eyes are beginning to feel less puffy
better than any "primer"
my skin has never looked better
the only reason i gave it 4 stars is because it is so pricey
use it morning too
just wish it was cheaper.
my complexion seems a bit more even
a lot of blemishes acutually got a lot better
bump got smaller too
so far i'm loving this product.
i can actually see my face cleaner
so far so good
it is so light
a heavier cream to only the areas that need it
it is more than i wanted to spend on a moisturizer
makes makeup last longer
it's a little on the expensive side for how much product you actually get
just beware: there isn't much in that package
a little goes a long way
rather than simply pumping it into my h
i really don't like the price-it's a lot more than some other good moisturizers
i love this so far
i can see alot of makeup still left over
works well in the summer too
foams—pretty much everything is too drying
also your makeup will look much better on nicer skin
it is on the pricy side but it lasts a long time.
no more drugstore stuff for me
a little goes a long way
i think it works better that way
my skin has never looked better after a month of using this line
so far it seems nourishing
i see some people have mentioned the scent as being too strong
just a few days i have so many compliments on my skin of how much smoother it looks
it does everything it says it will and more.
my acne scars have begun to fade more quickly than they would naturally
it makes my skin so much brighter
they say my skin looks more firm
that goes on well
i find my skin is much more even in color
a little goes a long way!
my skin is in a much better place!
my skin tone is more even
i liked it so much
it is a little expensive
people often think i'm in my mid 20's
that's no longer the case
i feel guilty because i have spent so much more money on other department store serums hoping they will trump this product
it just looks a bit better
that said, my skin has never looked better.
keeping my skin a little more balanced
improved the deeper ones
it has been a good experience so far
i like this one much much better
the smell is much nicer
a little goes a long way.
not like the usual rose that i thought
it's a little bit expansive to buy it alone
my skin tone definitely looks more even nowadays
think i do look a bit brighter
so when i went for more
i like how a little of this goes a long way -- the bottle lasts me quite a long time
hope so since it is pretty pricey.
my skin tone is more even without make up
often times i do
not too light nor too heavy.
brighter to the point where people actually comment on it
maybe with even more continued use i'll start to see that
there is quite a bit of product in there
i've used pretty much every product out there under $100
even though it has spf in it
found it to be too heavy for day wear
actually feels more like a gel
in summer this sometimes works too
need something more matte
i do think i've seen some refreshing of my skin-- it's a little clearer
it does take a little while to see results (i.e.
blocking more sun damage is probably the best i can hope for
why there are so few is beyond me.
wanted to try lancôme since it's cheaper
the only negative is it is a little greasy looking at times
which was always normal
so far it works great
i is not too heavy or greasey
now i love this better
it goes on much lighter
it lasts a really long time
i tried the more expensive lancôme regenerie lift
i love that even more
though there are others out there that are way more expensive
no breakouts so far, either.
smells good but a little stronger than i prefer.
still, i like it.
a little goes a long way
somewhat tighten throughout the long days
i find that it goes a long way
not nearly as good
a little goes a long way.
smoother when i use this
is just as great a product as some of their more expensive moisturizers
i like this crem very much
so far so great.
it does feel a little heavy though.
don't mind it so much
i wish it would do more to make it softer
lancome's product is nothing like the rest.
only bad thing is that it is expensive.
a little goes a long way
even better than that
i've found that after using it a few times i have a better feel for it
it works well too
remember a little goes a long way.
this is a little more expensive than some of the other products
i never would have paid so much money for this
even with extremely breakout-prone skin i still haven't used the whole thing yet- a little goes a very long way
it works better than anything i've found to clear up pimples when i catch them at the beginning
seems to go a long way since you only need a little bit
so far i love this product
it is a little expensive.
it just got worse
it's better to use a very little
you are using too much
this is way better
then you are using too much
i no longer get the big
my skin never looked better
last very long as u only use a little bit
very little does go a long way so my sample lasted me longer than i expected
it works so well
they are pretty much gone now!
no more bumps not even during that time of the month
it works so well
my makeup looks a million times better
lasts longer with this cream
a little goes a long way
my laugh lines even look better.
it costs, but a little goes a long way.
it is probably just a normal moisturizer
since it's so thin that a little can go a long way
it goes on so smooth
already her skin is more even toned
t can't be much more expensive to do
allowing my renergie foundation to look even better
way too procey but man, what a luxury.
my skin looked better than it ever has
didn't absorb as quickly as i would have liked i do feel lancome has superior products
i used a bit more than that the first time because i wanted to make sure i had enough to get the sunscreen benefit
with my combination skin i worry that it might be a bit too rich for year round use
how much brighter my face looked
a little expensive but a little goes a long way.
goldilocks would say that this is a well balanced product
seriously this absolute night recovery cream works just as well as the injections did at a much cheaper cost
as you only need a little bit
is much more affordable than lancôme
lancôme when my skin is in a bigger need
would never have even tried something this expensive
my skin looks better
although this line is a little more spendy
it goes a long way
the new line absolu precious cells is sure to be a top-seller too it is even more fabulous
it does work well
it was too heavy for me
as far as any other changes so far i did not notice
so far i find the moisturizer going on smooth
as much as i love it
without any luck so far
it's expensive, but a little goes a long way.
i think this is more of a moisturizer than anything
this could've been a sales pitch to get me to buy more product
none make me look younger
the skin around my eyes feels much better
thus product does a great job of hiding it
this one is always better
i only use it at night though because it takes a little longer to absorb
a little goes a long way
at 75 i have tried so many
if you put on too much
hope it lasts as the price tag is pretty high
it is a lot of money
works well if you are going to do something harsher like a mask or treatment later
my skin has never looked better
i just wish it were a little less pricey though.
thus giving it a little sudsy look
rather than a cotton ball
the reason i'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is because it stung my eyes terribly
this cleanser turned out to be better than what i expected
felt that i was pulling too much around my eyes
a little goes a long way
this does a good job of getting it off my skin so that my cleanser is more effective
i feel like 2 pumps works better than 1
the only thing about it is that it still sting a little if it gets in your eyes
well this actually works better than i tough it actually removes my eye
never too much product
makes my makeup come off easier
mineral make-ups better than anything else out there
product lasts quite a while
this one is so light
don't smell it on myself for more than a minute
everything goes on much easier
my face has never been softer or smoother!
i've gotten so many compliments about my skin
seems to even out the red/sallowness of my fair skin as well for a more even complexion
just not as much as it claims to
it was much more of a liquid than a cream
you are able to see how much product is left
this product shows you how much product is in the bottle
even that was way too much
it still had spf
love that i get more for my money
it is pricey but does the job well :)
it smells much better than clinique
i think the key is not using too much.
an amazing product and a little goes a long way.
leaves your skin feeling better than ever
long lasting as well
skin is more even
a very little goes a very long way.
a little goes a long way in case you are concerned about price
after i finish the jar i will have better idea about the effects of using this cream
took me a little longer to rub it in at first because i was using too much
my skin is looking better since using it
at first this night cream seemed like it would be too heavy for my skin
my skin seems clearer and more even toned.
so many women my age think that a product has to be heavy to work
this one is by far
you only need a little bit at a time
i really don't think i can finish this in less than 6 months
it works so much better.
they aren't gone but it looks better!
it goes on so smooth
so you don't use too much
will be awhile because a little goes a long way
a little goes a very long way
have not seen much difference
little bit goes a long way.
being on disability i find it to be a little bit expensive for me
it is an effective moisturizer: no more rough spots
my complexion has never looked better
so far i really like it
i would suggest it to anyone with much confidence
which is even more so during the summer
if it still feels like it's been absorbed too quickly
it is a little bit heavy but absorbs well.
a little goes a long way.
although it is a little greasy
which gets even worse in the colder months
i don't like to spend too much on cosmetics
i no longer have any problem on my face
it is a little bit greasy in that a little goes a long way
i hope it does as well this winter.
my skin is more even toned
my skin feels softer and looks better.
my makeup lasts better during the day
this product is a little heavy
so far so good.
i like this better
it has a very fluid texture however a little goes a long way
or else it can be a little too heavy on my skin
a little goes a long way with this product.
i found this product to be a little heavy
a little goes a long way
maybe a year or longer now
maybe it is a little preventative?
i am shocked that i've been hoarding this little gem for so long without realizing how effective it can be
there's no denying how much better my skin both looks
i loved the texture of this product so much i even used it in the day time
this will help delay or make wrinkles look a little better
for the past 10+ years i have been trying heavier creams trying to get enough moisture into my skin
it isn't as heavy as a lot of them
as it gets colder it is going to be just perfect.
this product is better fo me
my skin looks much younger
probably my skin needs something heavier
i did need something richer than my regular moisturizer
a little goes a long way
cannot believe how much better my skin looks
my skin looks better than it has in a long time
i cannot believe how much better my skin looks after using this product for less than a week
i seem to have a little bit of
it is not a glow so much as just a healthier look
noticed how much softer
more glowing my skin looks now
this is good but expensive.
use sparingly.. a little goes a long way.
oh, and a little goes a long way too.
i love this eye cream so much
probably don't want to use too much too
'm not showing too many wrinkles yet
it's lasted a pretty long time
it's very thick, a little goes a long way!!!
it has also helped very much with my dark circles
think i'm going to opt to only using it at night since it's a heavier cream
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way.
looking worse than when i started
very little goes a long way.
still have a lot left
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way
likes to borrow it when he hasn't gotten enough sleep
i wish it helped more with puffiness
a little goes a long way with this product.
a little does go a long way.
which makes spending the money a little easier for some
if this cream was even $100 more i would still buy it
love it so far
is that it does go on a little greasy
making application of make up a little difficult
for far less cost
its not like my eyes got worse
a little goes a long way
a little bit goes a long way.
i used a little bit
a little goes a long way.
which i like very much
some of them are gone
a little bit goes a long way.
a little goes a long way.
i will say that this is a little bit greasy
it's a little too much for daytime.
that could be because i wear a lot of eye makeup though
when applying it only takes a little bit
so a little goes a long way
my eyes looked better
have much softer smoother skin
they look so much better!
i like it very much.
i love this eye cream so much!
in the morning i use very little
great product it's easier to carry than powder.
my only complaint is that its too expensive
they are far above the rest
they do last quite some time- overall
so far these haven't broken out my very acne prone skin
others that are cheaper does the job as well
they may be a little bit more expensive than others
i knew she needed a little "lift"
they are a little pricey
which are much much cheaper
it actually works for that too
i just wish the sheets were a bit softer
i wish they came in a bigger size because they are so convienent
t's much easier to wash the rest off
certainly better than no cleansing at all
trying to find something good for travel or quick cleanup at the end of a long day when i'm just too tired to wash my face properly
what could be better?
it takes off makeup quite well
because they work so well
yet really get all the grim
can imagine how much better a new bottle would be
my makeup application has been going much more smoothly
the rep recommended this moisturizer to help with it i only tried this one time so far
i can tell the difference it feels so much lighter than my usual moisturizer
murad matifying lotion seems to do a better job
ever since i have started using this moisturizer i have noticed that i can go hours longer without looking shiny
my skin looks better in the morning
falls short a 5 star rating because while it does slightly mattify
so, its probably not too travel friendly.
pretty much what it claims
so far this is the one product that has done neither
so far, so good though!
so little moisturizer comes out with each pump
my makeup looks so much better after 8 hours as well
however not nearly as much as with other moisturizers
it could cost less as well
i keep buying it for more than a year
i don't have as much acne as before
a little goes a very long way
it also smells nice and a little goes a long way.
love it so much!
it is also a great deal because a small bottle can last so long
in the summer it gets worse
a little goes such a long way
my skin felt softer than ever
thankfully a little goes a long way.
a little goes a long way
i do worry a little about the lack of spf
my cheeks are often alittle bit rough
you might love this product as much as i did too :
so far so good with shiseido.
am no longer using this as a moisturizer
smooth out my face a little
tons of different kinds that promise oh so much
you need so little to cover your whole face due to the liquid-y consistence that the bottle will last a long time
so far so good.
those are bad as well
my makeup stays on longer, too.
a little goes a long way
does help control the oil much longer than other products i've tried
a little goes a long way with this product.
the appearance of my face is much more smoother
i think i might need something heavier for the winter
now i'm getting older and i still want to use it.
no strong odors, a little goes a long way.
i love it so much!
a little bit goes a very long way
it is light enough that even my husb
so i can always apply more when needed.
this by far has not had a problem.
combined with this my skin feels softer than i remember it being as a child
this one works better for me in the winter
just a little dab goes a long way~~
as they tend to leave me greasier than i am naturally
this goes on so light
during the day i found my skin actually feeling less oily than usual
i'll probably need something a little more hydrating next fall/winter
even though i like the claudalie product line
also, a little goes a long way.
a little goes a long way.
not too heavy or too light!
this product is way better than any other moisturizer out there
you might think that $32 is expensive
right now is winter so it is so far so good.
use it even more
i always take a jar with me on vacation in case i get too much sun
i've just started graying so that adds to it
it is not too heavy for me
my skin looks much more healthy
it just couldn't keep my skin moisturized for more than an hour or so
as if my skin has absorbed as much product as it needs
quite a few fine lines
lasts a long time, too.
a little goes a long way
feels a little heavy in the summer
that just means i have to wait a little longer for it to absorb
you have to know that a little goes a long way
it is not heavy and not too light.
i should actually use a heavier moisturizer
it actually helps clear up some acne as well
it is a but pricey but a little goes a longg way!
a little goes a long way
so that might factor in as well to the fast results
i really recommend to get the larger size too since it is better value
maybe my expectations were too high
there is none better
as far as fine line goes it definably helps to smooth them out
because these are probably the most impressive short-term results i can remember seeing in a moisturizer
probably from the hydration more than anything
nothing works as well as this does.
my makeup looks so much better thanks to this cream
this cream has definitely changed my skin for the better
with this its gotten a lot closer than when using other creams
the refill for the pretty container is a bit cheaper than buying the whole new pretty packaging
it will even help your makeup look better if you put it on underneath
a little really does go a long way.
just a little bit goes a long way
will not repurchase found better for less money.
tried to not too much
as far as the quality goes
a little does go a long way.
i wish it were bigger for the cost though.
more so than with any other cream
you only need a little bit each application
a little bit goes a long way
thanks for giving me the "little to go containers" now
in fact my skin felt a bit oilier than usual
tone of my skin is more even
i've also noticed a little bit goes a long way!
it is a little pricey
a little goes a long way
i seem to think its okay to splurge on something expensive that gives you good results than keep buying cheaper things
expect little or no results
the amount needed is very little
it goes on quite smooth
a little goes a long way for sure.
so far, i'm loving everything about it!
a little goes a long way
thinking this would be too thick
my face is actually not as oily now as it would usually be during the previous summers
they disappear a lot quicker than before
even though the price is a bit high
my skin has never looked better!
you just need a little bit to apply
i needed a little something more -- i now use the argan oil as a 'serum' b/4 using this cream
as it is a bit much for my budget
no stores to try much
it's like a better version of the old benefiance.
a little bit goes a long way.
this product makes it look even better
its the first skin product i've spent this much money on
also look as if some of the fine lines are gone too
as a little bit goes a long way
in the winter, it's not too much for me.
my skin still has to be blotted as much as it ever did
bettter than most of the high end moisturizers i have tried
yet it moisturizes my skin better than most other products do
i found this to be heavier than i'd like for a day cream
now i need it much more
you need very little
although this stuff costs a lot
just a little goes a long way
i get more compliments from friends
even though it is a bit expensive
a little of this cream goes a long way.
it does seem a little heavy at first
my face feels a lot softer and looks brighter.
oilier around which ive noticed most people have become lately
my skin has never been more clearer from any moisturizer ive used
"your skin is clearer" / "you look younger"
my face is less dull
t's really not that expensive
my face looks much better
i've give it a longer try though
it's pricey, but a bit goes a long way.
maybe i'm just using too much
i also really like that a little goes a long way with this cleanser
nicer than when i was using a different product
it's already more than enough
the only time i switch it up a little is in the dryer winter months when my skin needs a little more moisture or i use an oil
although i still love it
i also feel like this has brightened up my skin a little bit
i know which cleaner i'm going to stick to now!
it gets a lot foamier than a lot of other soaps i've tried with it
works into a good lather very easy so not much is needed
much more even-toned from this product
a little goes a long way
it leaves my face feeling a little tight
seriously love how so little foams up into a ton.
i love this product so much!
i only use it at night because it is rather drying
i imagine the ingredients might be a bit strong for others
perhaps i like this one the most because it felt a little more gentle than the others
a little goes a long way.
you should use a little bit
only a little is needed
i think that this product is better for those who have oily skin
a little goes a long way with this product
i used some too because i needed some brightening to my dull face
my face as a whole is becoming brighter
the first time i used my usual amount- way too much
i did the math- i'll be spending less since i won't be buying as often
really gives your face better brighter healthier look
make my face even that much better
a little goes a long way and it foams up nicely.
a little goes a long way.
a little goes a long way
haven't even gone through the whole tube
i started to notice my skin become more even-toned
my skin does seem brighter
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way.
concentrated so you don't need to use that much
a little goes a long way.
a little goes a long way.
it lasts so long
i no longer had my father's quite dark skin
so stick with it
my face became far too dehydrated
a little definitely goes a long way
a little goes a super long way
it feels much clean and does't need to use a lot.
because it wash out too much oil from face.
a very little bit gets unbelievably foamy so a little goes a long way
as far as the brightening goes
the dark spot afterwards goes away much faster
just a little drop foams and goes a long way.
most people think i'm much younger than % am thanks to my smooth skin
a little really does go a long way
i will definitely try more porducts from this line
a little goes a long way
my skin has lightened, more even and looks great.
i wish the spf were a bit higher
my skin looks so much younger!!!
i still prefer the older version of this.
see how i like them as well too
am noticing i need a wee bit more moisture than before so this does the trick quite nicely without being greasy
i love this moisturizer so much
my face feel so much smoother in a span of a few days
my only wish is that they would be a little easier on my pocket
so far this product has not caused break out
i love this one as much as any of the other products
not as much as i would like
i know i should have taken better care of my skin when i was younger
makes it a litle brighter
it may make the face too white if you are already light
this product is a little pricey
it looks more even
need to put on more than i think i need
it was just too harsh for my skin
the color of my skin is more even
it could be a little too rich
a little goes a long way.
i think this is better than the lotion.
it also goes well under my makeup
missed it so much
so that may be why this product works so well for me
just much more healthier looking
others said it was too thick
may not work too well with combination skins
may need something a little lighter for summer
i never want to use too much
might make more sense to use it at night
the overall appearance of my skin is definitely more even
it can be a little much in the summer
it does everything it claims and more.
my skin looks better after about a week of regular use
a little goes a long way.
also a little of this cream goes a long way.
i know its a bit expensive
a little goes a long way
the little bottle is so pretty
it is a little thick so a little does go a long way
it has made my skin tone more even
it has become worse
a little goes a long way
just as good as the even pricier creams
its a little too thick for me during the day
a little goes a long way.
and a little goes along way!
little goes a loooong way
i still see very little difference
i still have little tiny lines that probably won't go away
so far i have a month using this eye cream
the bags under my eyes have gotten lighter
are way less puffy than what they were a month
if i am getting these results so far i will definitely keep buying this eye cream
i like this one better than just all about eyes
they definitely haven't gotten worse
a little goes a long way
those seemed to give faster results
my puffiness is consistently getting better
i found that this eye cream does just as well as some much more expensive creams that i've purchased in the past
my eyes are so much brighter
my under-eye area looks so much better since i started using this
the eye cream may need to be a bit more "beneficial"
a little goes a long way, too.
it helps with dark circles too
i still think this moisturizes better than most
a little goes a long way
so you don't have to use as much
so far its good
it actually even made it better
little goes a long way so this will last you a while
i still like it a lot
although they seemed better initially
looking better than ever
i do notice that the skin is a little firmer
what i'm more concerned about is the quality of the product that does not leave my eyes feeling greasy
my eyes looked so much better.
perhaps it should be marketed differently
so after straying from this stuff to try other
a little goes a long way
as i've gotten older i've noticed that my under eye area has gotten really dry so my make up wasn't applying as well as i would like
i noticed a difference rather quickly.
my eye makeup goes on much better
my eyes are much happier
i still like juice beauty better
dark circles still seem there.
a little bit goes a very long way
a little goes a long way
noticed that my eyes look slightly less puffy though it hasn't done much for the dark circles yet
my eyes look fresher i definitely will repurchase it again
i love them so much
this helps so much
hopefully even better results are to come
something about everyone has left me wanting more
it can leave you a tiny bit tight if you are more on the drier side
i've tried so many cheaper cleansers
definitely worth the money because it lasts longer as well
so far, this has been great!
my skin has never looked better
i break out a little
i like this product very much.
my skin feels softer after using this as i don't think it strips as much as the fresh
it still seems to take off my makeup well
frankly the less steps the better
it is much better than i thought it would be.
sometimes i get too much from the pump or it slides off my h
i love this product so much
it is a litte pricey
alittle goes a long way
a little bit goes a long way...
it makes my skin tone a bit more even
alittle goes a long way.
my face was much cleaner
a little goes a long way
it may be a bit pricey
i wish it were a lot cheaper
although i prefer a cleanser with a bit more foaming action than this one
perhaps eye makeup too
i love the results i have had thus far
some make me break out more
like it very much.
so you get less product than it looks like
the last little bit is so hard to get out
a little goes a long way, too.
i am no longer red
a little goes a long way, too.
no more break outs!
make my skin more red
my skin has never looked better!
even though winter hasn't been as harsh as usual here
felt so much better
especially now that it's getting colder
my skin has never looked better
the daily combo of products has made my skin feel 1000 times better
has made winter juuuuust a bit more manageable
think my skin looks so much better
i break out less
some people may find this feeling more like a residue
this cleanser is better than the other one
my only other thought about this product is that i wish the silky smooth feeling lasted a bit longer
i just love this so much!!!
my skin no longer breaking out
a little bit lathers up real well.
my skin no longer breaking out
no longer need foundation
something that's become much more important to me since i had children
i wanted something more
brighter every time i use it
couldn't be happier with the results
it worked even better than the first version!
it has helped a lot
t's nice that the amount dispensed isn't too much
i've only been using this for about 12 days now so not very long
the darkness under my eyes does seem to be lighter
as far as the fine lines
i like the way it seems to tighten
my eye make up goes on much smoother.
wish it were less expensive
the only thing is when you pump it out it is too much
half as much would do
it also makes my dark circles much brighter.
a lot more than you need comes out-press slowly!
easier than having teabags
so far this product is as close as we've gotten to one
it did seem to make my dark circles lighter in just a few uses?
even after washing my face at the end of the day the dark circles still seems much lighter than before using this
just need to use little pressure using the pump or it will emit too much gel
a small "however": the pump amount is too much
just a little dab goes a long way.
my eyes feel more refreshed than they ever have
bags under my eyes that are just too tough for just one product
my wrinkles are better
less puffy than ever before
go gently because you will end up with too much product
a little goes a long way and it absorbs quickly.
haven't used it more than a week so can't speak to the long term effects
feeling better than it has in years
my skin looks sooo much better after 1 week!
most importantly, i see and feel results.
thank goodness it was easy to find a replacement that proves to be even more effective
not to the point where i wished it were heavier
i would give this cream 5 stars if it had better packaging
the pump tends to give too much product.
a little goes a long way.
happy that it hasn't changed too much
you only need a little.
the new packaging does pump out slightly too much
so start with half a pump so you don't get more than you need
i wanted to spend slightly less than my previous night cream
so far every night i've looked forward to using this cream
it would have five stars if it was a bit more affordable
a little goes a long way
it feels a little heavy
a little much in full summer
day cream have made my face much more comfortable
a little goes a long way
you have the sense you paid a lot of money for not much
i just love love this so much!
no more break out ever
because you only need to use a little bit- it last a long time
haven't had much luck
so even though it was more than what i wanted to spend it was worth it
which i actually use during the day too
i look slightly more well rested
i am loving it so far
it mositurizes much better than the skyn icel
my only complaint is that it feels a little thick
as long as i only use a little bit of the lotion it feels good
makes my skin look better in the morning
it just keeps getting better
it lasts a long time because you really only need one pump
better than wearing foundation.
she loves it just as much as i do
a little goes a long way
well, maybe the price is high, for me.
my skin has never looked better!
a little does go a long way!
even the bigger bottle of body lotion costs less.
are no longer as dark as they were before
a little goes a very long way with this rich cream
do notice a little goes a long way
if it was cheaper, it would be perfect!
it goes a long way
like this product very much.
it looks better, less tired, less dry, less aged.
my skin looks better then ever
results better same day
so far so good.
if anyone had anything that would very much help for pores
although the product is very little
i left it on for a little longer than what is on the instructions
i just expected more from it, that's all.
i did become accustomed to it after awhile
a little expensive for the size, but works well.
they have never made quite the effect that this one makes
hope my skin keeps getting better
i'd describe it more as crumbling off than 'peeling'
if you use it more than once a week you get better results
remember, a little bit goes a loooong way!
a little goes a long way
i feel like so much product is left in the bottle when it runs out
seem to finish quicker which i think is in part to this cleanser
i can pretty much go without makeup now!
a little product goes a long way.
i much preferred the lighter
my face just wouldn't get better
i gave it four stars because the packaging is a tad inconvenient
my skin breaks out more
much more travel friendly than the glass container
also, the old packaging was much more amazing.
anything to the point where i was about to spend hundreds of dollars on an acne program when i found this nice little product
now i don't feel much besides maybe a little bit of tingling
has also really improved the scaring
after trying too many products
i no longer have those little bumps everywhere
using dermadoctor twice a day has made my acne spots so much smaller
is so much cheaper than proactiv
so far out of everything i've ever tried this actually works
there was about a week period where i thought this was making things worse
it works way faster than the drugstore spot treatments i've tried in the past
a little goes a long way.
this product works more quickly than any acne treatment i've ever used before
making the acne even worse
a little does go a long way.
you probably used a little too much
although my oily skin was still very much around.
my face was so bumpy too.
my face is so much clearer
though it can sting a little
it just kept getting better
have actually broken out more than i have in a long time
these only seemed to "help" the problem a little.
my skin is noticeably more balanced
also, i break out a lot less compared to before.
it is gone a lot sooner
my skin is better than it has ever been
my skin is looking so much better
a little goes a long way
am hoping to see even more results
you only need a little
making this a much better value than you'd think just based on price alone
when recently things got worse
i'll use it in the morning too
it just takes a little bit longer to see results
my face has started to become so smooth
product seems to work well.
my skin literally started looking so much better after a week
i think they are fading too
that has made this even better
it is a little expensive
you could tell her face looked so much better than it had in the past
for the most part this product has really improved my skin
it does sting a little at first
it was normal, or well on it's way.
with just 3 used so far they have faded dramatically
have never found anything this effective
i leave it on for like 5 min or more most of the time
i've noticed that sometimes my long lasting make up isn't always all removed
since day one i notice my skin left much cleaner.
i've heard this product is more for problem skin-
it works so well my husb
since i have been using this product my bumps have gone down so fast
it might sting a little if you have breaks in the skin
its helped my skin get clearer than it has ever been
my acne areas are so much clearer
only a few little blemishes that go away very qucikly
the active breakouts i did have were healing faster than ever
mainly use it at night when i have more time to wait around
my skin is looking so much better
i've gotten so many compliments on my skin.
they better never stop making it!
worse than when i first tried the eradikate from kate somerville
put it over my entire face rather than just my breakout
it has helped the rest of my face as well
it is a little price
a little bit goes a long way
my skin has never looked better
it works so well.
not too much pain
i get more breakouts
i may come off as being a little too dramatic about this product
changing birth controls only helped so much
it works so much better!
most of the time it takes a week or less
a little goes a long way
foundation can be a little tricky
i like this product so far.
you're only making it worse
i like it so far
it's better than ever
and who knows, it may just keep improving!
none have seemed to be much help
i did notice that my face got a bit worse before it got better
you will see results that are better than many prescriptions that i tried
'solutions' often create more problems than they solve
not this little gem!
it is light and a little goes a long way.
while it is a bit pricey
not much hope left
only after two weeks too bad i didnt try it sooner
my skin looked much better
give it a little time to start working
it's getting worse the older i get
they are healing much faster than they heal without this product
i couldn't be happier
or cause more break outs
a little goes a long way
i've had comments from others on how much better my complextion looks
they are gone much quicker
much more even toned
this new formulation is even better than the last one
i like the new and improved version even better.
so far i've noticed that this combination of washes has worked well for my skin
now that i use the exfoliating wash every other day the break outs have been much better
it looks a lot smoother
my pores looks so much cleaner
it's brighter, softer, and more alive.
i typically use it once i start feeling my face getting rough
the application is so much smoother
my face has started over compensating for the lack of oil with too much oil
a little goes a long way
i just wish it came in a smaller size since i don't use an exfoliating product too often
is more likely able to help more people with less irritating fragrances
could never find anything to help her even a little bit
a little bit of this stuff goes a long way
it helps clear up my acne better than anything else i've tried
some may say there are drugstore products just as good if not better than this stuff
my skin texture looks so much better
which only hurt my skin more
it did little in terms of skin care
in my younger years i used more of a stronger scrub like dr
a little goes a very long way so even the smaller bottle lasts a long time
i like to use it at night because it does cause a little bit peeling
i don't think that this face wash would remove larger milia or any bumps near the eye as it is probably too strong to be used in the eye area
it turned out to give me more acne
even when i occasionally use it more than once a day
my skin looks so much better
so far i've enjoyed this product
irritating it more than it already is
other products seem to go i'm better after use
i will purchase again this is also sold in a miniature it may be a little bit rough or harsh for sensitive skin so maybe you want to try the smaller one before investing
i couldn't be any happier with this
the only difference i feel like is that it is less abrasive on the skin
i only can use every other day or it drys my skin to much
other than that i love it.
i noticed after about a week or so of using it that my moisturizer glides on so much easier
everything is so much smoother
i expect my skin to keep getting better
its not so harsh
a little goes a long way
it goes a long way
i could not be happier.
i found myself using more than i should
my face looks a little brighter
more even-toned in the morning
the kit is a great way to start though since it is a little pricey
i find that i can go a little longer in the day
use a few less oil sheets with it as well
smoother with a much more even tone
it did look my skin tone more even
it does sting a little
creams that i use soak into my skin more thoroughly so that they work better than they did before i began using this product
it looks younger and healthier.
love my new sephora tube even more!
i think there should be something out there with similar price or even cheaper that would work better for my super dry skin
still have a good amount of product left
i like it because it is slightly more intensive than "dry combination"
which is better for my skin during the colder months
a little goes a long way
i do find that sometimes it doesn't work as well in the drier winter months though
a little goes a long way with this product
i still have quite a bit left
no longer need one of those very heavy
so long as clinique keeps making it
it is a little expensive
t works out quite well
ever since i started using this i don't break out as much
none works the way this has for me
much better than the jar products that you have to dip your finger into
it has very little smell
it still feels heavy
since my skin looks nicer
so far, so good.
more even toned after just a couple of uses
it makes my face more even toned
i really like it so far.
not too little- though i can imagine if you have much drier skin it might not be enough for you
this one has little to no smell
even though my h
as my combination light skin has never looked better
my skin has started to look a little tired
i wonder if i can find more bang for my buck elsewhere
i also use a little dramatically diff oil-free lotion to make it spread a little easier
overall pretty good so far.
concentrated, so you don't have to use much.
even better i love how it feels on my skin
has a more even complexion now
it's expensive for not much in the container
only wish the tube was bigger!
some fine lines look a little better
even though it is aging
i finally tried this more expensive version that will be replacing it
its much heavier like an oil base
a little goes a long way
i've always had normal-combination skin
probably too heavy for me in summer
i couldn't be happier
i wanted something a little heavier for nighttime use
this product is nothing less than amazing!
while it is rather expensive for the amount
is packed with antioxidants epecially if i use it with even better
it is a bit heavy though.
as far as i know it is a moisturizer
have not gotten more wrinkles since using it
i assumed for some reason it was going to be thinner
/or something more rich over it
as far as skin texture
i see that i don't have more wrinkles than before
so far i really like it
which is saying a lot
my wrinkles look better also!
no matter what products you use it seems like it takes longer to see results around the eyes
a lilttle goes a very long way
it is expensive, so be sure to use only a little.
somewhat pricey yes, but very well worth it.
this product costs a bit more
no better than most other eye products
it does not really fill in lines very much however it does soften them
it still more than $20 less than this
makeup goes on well over it, too.
i did a little research
on a much simpler scale
this is taking care of the oil issue rather quickly
is making my foundation look so much more balanced
which is rather refreshing
my face actually feels normal
i tried the more expensive lancôme regenerie lift
i love that even more
looks so much better
just as fresh never disappoints
it's not as good in the winter when i need something a little more hydrating
i fear it may be too little product due to its "pump" nature
i wish it were a little more affordable.
feel that i went through it rather quickly
my face was already better
more so than any of the others i have tried
a little really goes a long way!
my face is much softer
i like it so far.
no longer get greasy throughout the day
i wish the scent was a little bit more subtle.
i love it so much!
it wasn't helping much
now that it's getting a bit colder
the cucumber smell is a bit much at first
my skin is becoming more
more easier to be oily
this keeps it from getting too bad
my skin has never been so smooth or consistently well-behaved
everything that i've tried has been too greasy
as i have gotten older it has become really combination
this is much healthier
maybe even lighter than the cleanser
the only issue i have is that my cheeks need a little extra love because of my combination skin
add makeup to this routine and it was even worse.
my skin actually balanced out
inqpuld have liked it better if it were more hydrating
so far i am a huge fan
i love more than hate this product.
i realized that i should go on the more natural side
i really like this lotion so far.
which is nice because that tends to happen more often than not when i try something new
this is my favourite night cream by far.
this problem becomes worse in the winter
i really like this so far.
am using better makeup
can stretch quite far if you use sparingly
it is high potency and a little goes a long way.
i guess applying too much may cause break-outs because our skin cannot absorb that much nutrition
it has done nothing
i find my self always coming back to this night cream after trying many different expensive night creams
i always wake up looking better than the night before
i like so far.
its a little pricey, but does everything it says.
acne solutions all over clearing treatment a week ago because the reviews are pretty good about it
my skin just kept getting worse
a little goes a long way.
after the first time i noticed how much better my skin not only looked
trust my i've probably saved lots of money cause i barely feel the need to wear makeup since using it
it also makes me a little red.
most have just managed to keep my face from getting any worse
so this might be way too harsh for some
nothing ever seemed to work
nothing i've tried works as well.
i'd switched from the gel one as this seemed easier
i don't break out much or often
much better than the type 3 soap
acne isn't as big a issue for me now as it was when i was younger
it take a little time for it to start working
my teen acne seems to have come back even stronger at age 30
they are much smaller
keeps getting better with use over time
now my face is back to normal looking better than ever
everything still went well
my skin has never looked better
still break out which is rather annoying
so far it has helped prevent many break outs for me
it's better as a system!
even that might be a bit more than i need
so far so good!
i now use it all year round- my skin has never looked better
i seemed to break out more
if it does get worse before it gets better
i still get pimples but not as much as i used to.
so far it works better than i expected.
so far i haven't had an issue with this drying my skin
i wish it came in a larger size because i need a new one pretty frequently
this has worked better than all of them
it is a little pricy for the bottle
this is more product and cost less.
it works just as well.
it took longer than i had hoped
i expected it to make the situation feel worse
so one tube lasted me quite a while
minimize it just a tad
i'd never use it on normal wee spots though.
it works better that way
it does the job well
sometimes ill put it on a spot during the day as well
generally what sephora carries lasts less than 6 months
i see the acnes get fairly smaller the next day
it seemed to work a lot better
i put a little bit of this on them
this works way better than i thought it would.
last for quite a bit
my skin feels way better now
for that it works well enough
but it's more drying than my other go-to.
i just wish you got a little more bang for your buck
word of caution: it says not to use more than twice a day
wish it was a bigger bottle.
just wish it came in a bigger bottle
as they seem to make me break out more
it works better than a 10% treatment i've tried before
including pretty much everything from the drugstore
before i go to bed at night makes spots either go away completely or be much less aggressive than without it
it also lasts a pretty long time
so much better than the other clinique spot treatments
she said this is more effective
a good price considering how long it lasts
eventhough the strength is not more than most others on the market
i like it pretty well so far
although it does reduce a little bit
it works so well.
it works quite well.
well, this is it.
still have plenty left
a bit goes a long way
great but expensive for the amount you get.
this would have been better if it was less expensive for the amount you get
every other acne treatment i've tried has been too harsh
or too ineffective to do any good at all
i think this stuff does a stellar job of making a pimple come to a head faster/better
especially if you have more mature skin yet still battle zits from time to time
when it gets worse
it will last a lot longer than you think
it is noticeably better by the next morning
really wished it came bigger !
she has tried many things
so this works well
my face looks better than it has in years
long story short it helps clear the zits/acne faster than any other product i've tried
this stuff works better than anything i've ever tried
that is no longer happening
they just keep getting lighter
my spots are pretty much invisible now
it's lightened them up so much that i finally feel comfortable going out in public without makeup
i couldn't be happier with this product.
my skin is so much better than it was before i started using this
i no longer use heavy makeup
it makes my new scars fade so much faster
i am still getting an amazing benefit from it at a much more affordable cost
it was amazing in making the dark scars much lighter
my skin was more even
for the little amount of product needed
actually make marks worse
my skin has never looked better
so far some of my old
keep in mind that some might see faster result than others
it will take some time to see a difference on some of the deeper scars
i already notice a difference on some of my lighter ones
has helped my skin so much
the more the better.
if you spend a lot of time in the sun or want a long term
i am no longer getting many new pimples
the really big deeper spots/scars are not really budging as much as i'd like
but that's expected since the spots are bigger.
still waiting for progress with older very dark spots
not so much that it was a problem
i find that this post-acne gel works better than clinique's dark spot correcter
now that redness has gone down way far
have ended up with even lighter eyebrows than before
i probably would have seen the same results using any product just because of normal cell turnover that progressively lightens the marks anyway
i could see the difference in less than a week.
some marks did get better
using as a spot treatment is better than putting it all over your face
no longer feel embarrassed about my face
although i wish it was cheaper
my spots are so much smaller
less red than before
a moisturiser applied after helps this a little.
a little bit goes a long way
pretty pricey, but seems to be working so far.
so far he likes them
lasts a long time as a little goes a long way
how much it costs
how little you actually get
against the better advice of others
i really like this product thus far.
this works far better
it takes a little bit of time
a little goes a long way too!
all my spots- some over a year old- were pretty much all gone
faster than when i was just using clinique on its own
a little goes a long way too.
i tried using clinique even better
my skin is about 50% better
i still have more than half of the bottle left
my skin is much smoother now then it was previously
a little goes a long way
i think he just may need a better moisturizer
he finds this product easier to use
the container is too big for those quick-trips
this is so much easier for him to use
this is a more grown up version with a soothing effect
my skin is the better for it
as it literally makes my face feel a lot cleaner than before
feels way better than any cotton ball
cotton pads was too much so this takes a step away
while$20 for 60 pads might seem a lot compared to the drugstore br
my face is looking four times better
much better than anything you would buy at the supermarket
they might seem a little pricey
more than i expected
one is more than enough for my face
just feels more "alive"
it's pricey for how much product you get
makeup looks so much better
the price is a little high though.
we know how much guys usually spend time on their face
double the price is a little pushing it
love it just as much
a little goes a long way.
my skin appears more even and less greasy.
a little goes a long way so use just a drop of product
ii is incredible how much better my skin looks after even just one night using this
thought it'll be too harsh
i never expected to love the night cream so much
my skin feels so much softer
my skin does look more even.
at least 6-7 months because a little goes a very long way
i pretty much use their entire line
better than the day before
yet it is definitely thicker than the average day cream
a little really does go a long way
i think a little does go a long way.
i felt as if my face was more even toned
my skin has never looked better
wanted a better night cream for my winter skin
the spots are soooooo much lighter
you only need very little product for each application
i like this cream a lot -- so much that i start using it on my upper chest
each day my skin is getting better
i've gotten so many compliments with
a little goes a long way
so even though it is pricey it will last a long time
i love this stuff more than i could ever say.
i can see an improvement rather quickly
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way so that even if it costs a lot of money
i can tell that this product might be too much for my skin if i were to overuse it
you need /so little/ to spread evenly on the face it should also you a couple months
a little goes a long way.
plump skin than i have ever felt in my life
as with most things that claim to brighten
i do agree the price is a little steep for such little product
unfortunately it's just too expensive for me to re-purchase every 5 weeks
can take a little to get used to
a little of this goes a long way!
also my skin is much brighter in the am.
a little of this product goes a very long way
i feel like my skin is more even
hard to believe a little tube like this lasts as long as it does
makes it so much clearer.
i can only imagine how much this will help my skin in the future
since i've been using this it has calmed my acne down so much
it helps fade away the blemishes so much faster
i found that just using this by itself help remedy the situation faster than using the serum too
my face looks better since i've been using it
i like it so far doesn't feel to heavy.
the fact i don't have to use too much
looks brighter when i use it
results are slow but it does work.
my skin is looking better than it did with the pevonia line
the cream did not make my skin look worse
has even tone to it
i really love it so far.
i think it is for more mature skin.
maybe i just need to use it a little longer.
since i have been using the product it has become much lighter
loved it so much i had to purchase it
-1 star because its so pricey
after a night of much wine
my complexion is much brighter.
i spent way more than $1
that lately i've been looking even younger
my skin tone has become more even/smooth
so a little goes a long way
it's thick, so a little goes a long way.
i actually look healthier!
i've tried plenty of other expensive
so far this one is the only one i've seen solid results with
i wish that the product went a little further since it is so expensive
a little goes a long way
as far as skin texture
love that a little goes along way given it's price tag
got something that looked worse
my skin looks better than it did 5-years ago.
it has made my skin so much smoother and softer.
for right now am happier than i have been in a long time thanks to this product
this is more expensive than others
a little goes a long way
more is not always better
i took one star away because it is very expensive
some stuff was better than others
it goes on more greasy??
i appreciate the fact that very little goes a very long way
it is pricey but it goes a long way.
it feels good, a little goes a long way.
this is making my skin complexion appear much more even
it also lasts a pretty long time.
maybe you have to use it more than 1 jar.
my skin is so much smoother particularly around my eyes
the whole line so far
it got most of it
back are clearer than they have ever been
far better than i had hoped.
a little goes a long way
it is mild enough for my older skin.
i think i have just about 8 more months to go
i'd give more than 5 stars if i could.
even more surprising was how it actually got rid of all my acne
the bar is much cheaper than the liquid soap
i been seeing less acne too
it makes my face feel so much cleaner than the soft soap cleaner i was using
has helped so much with the oil control
has a better consistency to it
it is rather mild
this bar works so much better.
not to mention more expensive
so far i haven't noticed much of a difference with my acne
the bar soap is definitely the way to go since you get so much more bang for your buck than the foam
not only is it less expensive
it lathers so much better
i worried that this was expensive for just soap
the bar lasts longer than the foam
it's so much more cost effective
has too much fragrance
works much better than the foam
i do notice i have gotten less
less of them the more i use this
nothing has ever worked well enough for me
that feeling fades after a little while
when i woke up, it seemed to diminish a bit more.
this bar is better than any liquid acne formula that i've ever used
lasts a very long time
using the two extra products all the time is too much
the bar lasts a really long time too!
i think this soap is a better value
it's working so far
i've never found a product that keeps my skin clear as well as it does
lasts a really long time.
so far, so good!
a lot better than before.
as far as my back
lasted my quite a while thankfully.
it also made my skin appear much cleaner.
way better than proactive or murad, love it!
i love the bar so much better.
this will last me so much longer
lasts a long time-more bang for your buck
love it so far
my acne is getting much better
possibly making it worse
it is so so so much healthier
i like how much you get for the $$ spent.
so far i have zero complaints
or making my skin worse
i couldn't be happier
i liked it way better than the black one
it also has not dried me out too much.
a little goes a long way.
it took quite a bit for it to work on my acne prone skin
mostly everything else from boscia
she needed something a ltlle gentler
it helps so so much
a little goes a long way
loving it so far!
now that i'm older i only break out ever so often
i love this brand so much.
a little goes a long way for sure!
only down side is that it dries it a little bit
so there is that
has helped my skin so much
my face seems so much more clear than when i used other products
use a little it does help
this keeps breakouts far far far away from me
my face is much clearer after 3 days
loved it so much that i wanted to try this out too
yet i had never really struggled with acne much as a teen
my skin has never looked better
only as an addition to your usual cleanser a few times a week if you have skin like mine
it is super duper concentrated so a little goes a long long way
looks way better i think this would be a great product for most people
this works for me without being too aggressive which would otherwise result in more pimples
more than just white heads
after a week of this my face looks better
a little goes a very long way
it is a little drying so every few days i use a different cleanser
it doesnt do too much for my acne
i love this cleanser so much.
it is a little pricy
little goes a long way
a little goes a long way
it does work well
a little goes a long way as well
two pumps is more than enough
this one seems to be doing the most for my skin
no big deal to me though.
little goes a long way.
his skin looks so much better
great for those that need a deeper cleanser.
it only takes just a little bit of product
i switched to a cheaper face wash only to find that my pores were getting really clogged
her skin has never been so even and smooth.
it works well with my clarisonic too
so far since i've been using this i haven't had a bad breakout
a little pump is sufficient for your whole face
the imperfections i do get heal much more quickly
a little goes a long way with this product
now not so much
maybe im using too little
a little bit goes a long way!
recommend to pretty much anyone
this product also lasts forever because a little goes along way
i only gave it 4 stars because i feel like you have to use it with the sponge to be more effective
it's softer and more even toned.
nothing i've used has come close to helping this much
it was not a lot but it was significantly better.
i break out much less than normal.
but the spots on my chin have not changed much.
now if i do i prefer something a little stronger than will actually dry my zits out
returned it because it was too gentle to really do anything to my rarer
and my old scars look better!
did i get more than that
it works so well!
my face looks so much better already
it's been less than a week
i gave it four stars because it tends to run out pretty quickly
loving it so far though!
a little goes a long way
it blends very easily so you really only need a little bit
more than once i've decided against buying it in tough times
because i loved the treatment so much
the more you use
the better it works
it gets better every day
when i do get a little breakout
i wish it were a bigger bottle at a better price
i break out less often too.
great product my skin is so much clearer with these products
i've tried so many things
my face has looked better since i have been using this
it does nothing for getting rid of acne marks as far as i can tell
i do notice that my skin looks a little better
good product, more mild than i'm used too.
feels to work a lot better when used along with other boscia products
as far as prolonged treatment
it was a lot better than the ole henriksen blemish attack
it feels refreshing and a little goes a long way.
well, i have found it.
thus giving me more acne
it keeps my skin much clearer
it also seems to make me a bit less oily.
not sure how well it works with more severe acne
this product make my skin look so much fresher
have little amounts of bumps
i needed something to help get rid of the little clusters of acne as well as help clear my pores
now there's no more bumps
i like the willow bark treatment better because it gives faster results
i still like the product
only wish that it was a little cheaper considering you only get 1 oz
this has cleared up my face better than anything else
i add a little more as a spot treatment
goes way quite quickly
feels better than it ever has
oh and a little goes a long way.
so far so good.
i've never had better skin in my life.
i couldn't be happier with it
a little goes a really long way.
makes my skin look instantly more even
in fact, it feels more like an oil cleanser.
considering how much it has helped my face
but maybe a little too gentle.
when you're left with noticeably better skin
not really for the better
liked it when the product was thicker.
this is still a comforting
in the winter it's even worse
haven't had much trouble with make-up being left on
it is so different from the usual cleansers that it takes some getting used to
i no longer have to use foundation
my skin is much less pink than before.
a little goes a long way.
my skin has looked much healthier since i started using it
t made it much worse
helps the red a little
my case just might be a little too far gone for this
my face is no longer red
use as little as possible each time to make it last
my skin is looking much brighter
it works so much better than anything else i have tried
only because i feel a different cleanser works better at removing makeup
i can wear a lot less face makeup now.
this has been very kind to my skin so far.
it feels a little greasy going on
get red as much
the bottle lasts a really long time
it cleans my sensitive skin better than any other product i've tried
it only takes a little tiny bit to work effectively
makeup routine so much easier
a little goes a long way
it takes a bit to see the effect
giving it more time.
great combination of not too heavy nor too light.
so far, so good with this moisturizer.
i wish it were a little lighter on the weight of it
i wish they made it in a pump style with a little less weight
a little goes a long way
seriously a little goes a long way
i will put it on on days where i exposed myself to a little too much sun or when i see a bit more redness than usual
will probably try to find something cheaper
his redness has become so much better
he looks so much better
even my usual products were too much for it to h
it looked better than it had even on my normal routine
the only thing that would make this product better is if it was half the price
you just need a little bit
you have to wait a little bit
give it some much needed r
it is slightly thicker
it's also better quality
my skin is even better
a little goes a long way
it was more expensive
not so much redness
i needed something that works better
skin becomes more even
it has been getting progressively worse
my face was much calmer
going for a more minimal approach has done wonders
it has helped a lot
helps my makeup go on better
it can cover better because my skin isn't as red
not drying or harsh as some products that seem to be better for younger skins plagued by acne
this is probably what the faces of women with healthy
although it does seem to be improving
now my usual makeup hides a little redness pretty well
my skin feels so much better.
i realized that my rosacea flare ups happen far less often
this works so well
so much that foundation hardly covers the redness
even my kids have said that my face is less red!
works well, my second jar so far.
is thick so you don't need to use very much
so far its working great
i wish it were a little cheaper though.
it was still better than what it used to be before bobbi brown
all i know is that this has changed my face for the better
my skin gets better every day with this product.
smoother than it has in awhile
to make it last longer
a little goes a long way
it does cost more than the cream
would like to see it be substantially better
my skin has never looked better.
of 24 years says i look better today
"you get more beautiful as you get older
!much better than the dior capture totale
just use a little - it goes a long way.
while it might be a bit on the pricey side there is actually quite a lot of product in bottle
a little does go a long way
a little goes a long way with this series
they keep getting better
too early to tell how effective it is.
t also lasts a very long time
it might be a little too rich for the summer
it is not easy to make the skin look younger in a month or so
the smell is a bit too strong
got too much sun until age 20
it really works with keeping my fine lines from becoming deeper
most everythign i so far have tried is good for awhile
still love every bit of it
now that it's getting colder
a little bit goes a long way.
now i have been using this a little more often than recommended
as i approach 27 though
my skin needs a little oomph
might go for a slightly more multitasking product like the algenist micropolish next time
not much product needed means a pretty cost effective product
i left it just a little longer
so far i've seen my face a lot better
needless to say- i'll be buying more!
it helped even more
it made my pores so much smaller too!
not so much where it was hard to rinse off
i still have some scars but it's a lot better.
alittle higher priced for a face mask
not much of a difference that i noticed at the time
would always settle in those lines more
more throughout the day
safe to say i love it even more now.
my skin looked even better the next morning
i also love how it makes my skin better soak up any other skin care products that i use
i leave it on a little longer than directed
my skin has never looked better!
a little goes a long way.
however, the price could be a little lower.
it's also stronger than i expected
after neglecting my skin for a couple years it had started looking quite bad
my skin has never looked better
can see big difference in how my makeup looks better
my skin is a little more plump
so far, so good.
the bottle lasts for quite some time.
i left it on longer than it tells you on the packaging
this does sting a little
my face looked and felt much better.
cons:i left it on way longer than 10m
i wish it comes on a bigger bottle
my face is definitely a little brighter
it just overall feels better
not tight as a lot of other masks will do
my face has never been brighter or smoother
afterward apply a nourishing cream which works so much better after this mask
be careful not to leave it on too long.
for lack of a better word
a little bit of product goes a long way so the bottle will last a long time
i think i'll get one more.
my overall skin tone was more even
it was just harder to get everything off
then i found an even better mask
it gets better with each week.
my skin is definitely brighter and more glowy.
as a matter of fact it tingles a little which leads me to believe it has more drying effect
it was a little messy at first to get the hang of it
my skin has never looked better
i also noticed it makes applying makeup much easier
scars that would take months to go away now go away so much quicker
although it is a bit messy
my skin has been looking much brighter
in general just much healthier with a glow
the only downside its it's very messy i wished it would come up with a better bottle design maybe like a shaker perhaps
my face looks a lot brighter.
the first few times you use it your skin will probably tingle a little
my skin did appear slightly better
a little goes a long way.
my skin looks healthier than it's ever been
i think it helped with the scars too
my skin looks brighter too.
how much easier can it get.
more even with less redness
it has also lightened my acne scars so much i can barely see them
my skin seems so much healthier
overall my face got brighter so smell doesn't matter much
you use so little, therefore it goes a long way.
it works well on me so far
my skin is much more even toned too
have to use a little less
the fewer products the better.
my skin just looks better.
definitely worth the little bit of extra work to mix it with your moisturizer
over all my skin looks even
although a little tricky to use
told me that my face was much clearer
once i've been using it daily y skin tone looks more even
made the mistake the first time of using too much
it burned my skin a little bit -
my skin has never been better!
plus i think it's a good value since a little goes a long way
the reason i didn't give it five stars is because dispensing it with the little scoop is a bit cumbersome
there's got to be a better way!
the results seem to get better by the day
a little goes a long way
using it can be slightly tedious
my skin is much more even
can use as little or as much as i like
only a week, my skin become more brighter.
try not to use too much
my skin gets just better
my complexion is so much brighter
use it as much
a little goes a long way.
it seems to make everything i add to my face better
a little goes a long way.
your skin will feel and look much smoother.
my skin does look a little more even
all you have to use it very little
i can tell a difference when i stop using it because my skin looks a bit more lackluster
ill always keep this little bottle around
just from a little itsy bitsy bit.
it won't be as bad when i'm older
they have lightened up a tad bit
it a little goes in my eyes it does not sting
today he was much more detailed
it was way more than i like to spend on eye creams
it's expensive but a little goes a long way.
pretty much always use it once a day
more even in tone
i just wish that it could have helped my dark circles a bit more?
has improved my dark circles so much
not much luck for my dark bags
brighter under eyes that seem to get even brighter as each week passes
my under eyes dark circles got a little lighter
it may be a bit pricey but it does help.
hopefully over time i'll see more improvement.
so far i am really liking this product!
a little goes a long way
it has lightened my dark circles a little- not as much
my eyes do look more plump
theyve diminished enough that im not as self conscious about them
end up wondering why my dark circles are looking even worse
am going to be patient a little longer for eye circles
definitely about to stick to this product for a long time
they are much better
my eyes look so much brighter even after one use.
this one though is more light and sheer.
my dark circles are much better after only a few weeks
this product has helped make it so much better
so much better then others i have tried
my eyes look so much better since i started using this
i tired a cheaper eye cream
it's just as noticeable if you stop using it for a few days too
i would say this is one of the better eye creams i've tried
i only wish it were a bit less expensive
i like it so far.
it is already less blue and looks more normal.
my boyfriend uses it as well-so far so good :)
i liked it so much i started using at night
it always seems like a need more puffiness
you do only need a little bit
it goes a long way
this eye cream seems even richer than shiseido's benefiance eye cream
it does seem to brighten the eye area as well.
brightens my eyes better than anything i have ever used
other than being a good moisturizer i did not see improvement for the dark circles under my eyes
she said you can easily wear it over makeup to give you more brightening
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way.
even on my most difficult days i find relief in using this
a little goes a long way.
which i feel is more like a foundation
some nights i rotate with something slightly heavier
i just put more on
how it has a light
this product works so well!
it would be even better if it contained spf
i feel that the texture of my skin is so much smoother
a little goes a long way
it does not take very much to cover all areas of my face
it also lasts for a long time too.
the only thing is that it sometimes feels like it's not absorbing as much as i'd like it to
so far i've only tried two
sometimes i still want a heavier moisturizer on at night even though i have combination skin
i wish the product would be a bit bigger other than that it's perfect
could not recommend more!
my skin has never looked better!
by far better than the dramatically different lotion
i never throw them away for the added benefit of keeping the product fresher for longer
makes the other worse
nothing else has been able to work as well as this has for me
this hasn't irritated it one bit
a little bit goes a long way
just ordered some more.
this product is going to last me a long time because a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way
i will say that if you are extremely dry maybe it will not be your favorite because it is more of a thinner consistency than a really heavy moisturizer
i love this moisturizer so much.
a little usually goes a long way unless i'm extra dry
my skin looks so much smoother
during the rest of the year my skin is more combination
use a little extra in the winter
a little goes a long way
this helps quite a bit
works well around eyes too
i would recommend the heavier version if you like in the cold
it worked well too
it even works for me as a primer!
my skin needs a little more moisture
which is my usual skin reaction to something that's upsetting it
i hate that this balances my skin so much better than all the previous moisturizers have ever used
a little goes a long ways.
this pretty much rid of it all
my skin feels smoother than ever!
i feel this one has more benefits
can be sure i'm not using too much of this expensive product —
a little goes a long way
i would say that this is more of a primer than moisturizer
a little goes a long way
this is so much better
a little goes a loooong way
applied only once so far.
a little goes a long way
so far it has controlled my oil level throughout the day
which would in turn cause more acne
less so with continued use
haven't used it long enough to see long term effects
liking it so far
also a little dab goes a long way.
a little goes a long way
no breakouts thus far.
a little bummed about how expensive these products are
this moisturizer does smell better than some of the other products in this line
a little goes a long way.
the only thing i do not like a lot about this one is that it is a little bit greasy
moisturizer has done more than i ever anticipated for my skin
it helps my foundation go on easier
i still have a little more than half left
if anything it helps your foundation to go on smoother
the only reason i'm giving it four stars instead of five is because it sometimes doesn't absorb all the way
a little goes a long way
had to switch to something heavier
also not greasy one bit
i don't have to use it as much any more
my eyes are much more refreshed with no millia
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way
this moisturizer has changed my skin for the better
my skin is also starting to look more even
they haven't worked as well as this has so far
so far so good
i can see a little bit of results already
skin tone got more even and fresher look.
it took to months for me to see results even though i found me something else for less the price
the results are even better
i would give this 5 stars if it were a bit less expensive
i believe that it is because i take just a little each morning
i do look brighter
you want brighter skin you can't get any better than this
she said the formula was just as good for less than half the cost
while people usually think i'm 10 to 15 years younger than i am
a little goes a long way
usually need to use more product to cover the whole area
makes your skin look much younger
a little go a long way
the longer i use it the better my skin looks.
it has helped even out the overall tone as well.
a little of this product goes a long way.
still have more than half the jar left
i've said before i keep trying other less expensive br
nothing works as well as perrricone
my skin is getting better
although it took a little bit to get used to the push dispenser top
i liked it very much because it dispensed just the right amount
my skin is more balanced looking
my skin looks better than it ever has
you only need a little bit it goes a long way
does not feel much different than their other products
my skin is no longer flakey or rough.
with each days use my toneis even and brighter .
even better with the clarisonic
i love this so much.
it helps even tone
i would love to try more product
it seems to last me quite a long time
my blackheads are so much smaller
now my skin has become brighter
like all perricone products it is a bit pricey
little goes a long way
a little goes a long way
so far so good
my skin is much smoother and brighter.
so far, i really like it.
which is good because it is a little on the expensive side
i loved it better when they still have skin clear cleanser which is milkier
this is more than just a cleanser
my makeup applies on so much more smoothly as well
it works so well on my older skin
get less for my money
the only thing that i can now say is better about fresh is that it is a lot more sensitive on the eyes
a little too tight of a feeling so would recommend as a cleanser during warmer months
and a little goes a long way.
while people usually think i'm 10 to 15 years younger than i am
my skin has never looked better
always go back for more
for much older skin
happier than i’ve been in a very long time
it seems to work well so far.
as i'm already aging pretty well
lancome visionnaire on my face to look much better
i think it should come in different shades though as i wish for a lighter one
spending lots of money too
even though it is quite pricy
a little goes a long way
i must admit that a very small amount goes a very long way
a little goes a long way
i hesitated paying so much for eye treatment
a little goes a long way
they provided me with faster
well this product does that and more.
while using this i did not see too much improvement
i feel like i look so much better and rested.
it is a little expensive
makes eyes look less tired
the lines under my eyes are actually diminishing too
like the product very much
the puffliness is much better
this is much better
i am a little less than optimistic that anything will deliver that much on an improvement
my eyes look better than they have in years
i will have to use it more than 10 days to really know if it performs "miracles"
again, very slightly, but there is a change.
a little does go a very long way.
meaning when i use it i do find that my skin around my eyes is brighter
if i use to much it feels greasy
than my eyes feel heavy
a little goes a long way
it is a little expensive
the skin under my eyes does look better
a little goes a long way
this has helped so much
even though its pricey
so far so good.
my skin actually looks firmer
i got a little bored
it gives the skin a younger look.
one pump goes a long way
i've wasted more $$$ trying other br
this is a little pricey
a little product goes a long way.
the longer i use, the better my skin looks.
a little goes along way as well.
more like a stinch smell to it
the texture looks better
everyday my skin seems to look better than it did the day before
my skin is also brighter than it has ever been.
has a much brighter appearance
hadn't had such a great result
my pores seem smaller too
i love it so far
while people usually think i'm 10 to 15 years younger than i am
my skin is getting much better
he is now a fan as well
i found that i like the cleanser i’d been using better
so far it's been great
this wash smells much better than the other wash that i was using by this company
my skin looks much clearer and feels clean.
it is a little pricey for face wash
takes very little when using.
even though i hate spending this much money
maybe i'm expecting too much
became an issue i could no longer overlook
side note: in dispensing one pump i can do both eyes so you use very little of the product
makes that little bottle travel friendly
finding the beginning of the checkout wasn't as obvious as perhaps needed
while people usually think i'm 10 to 15 years younger than i am
they are no more
i just reordered this product because it works so well
i've tried everything with little to no results
so far it is all true
a little really goes a long way so you don't need a full pump or you'll end up with too much
better than any other product.
if i need extra help i use more often.
a little bit goes a long way.
i am getting better everyday
seems to be more for the 55 plus group.
a little does go a long way.
a little goes a long way
those are little deeper
my skin looks so much better
just want to give it a little more time
but, it had better be at this price!
all of which seem to make the skin smoother
a little goes a long way
it does smell slightly.
pretty much line free
other people began to notice it too
usually i end up using more than i thought i would
i'd give this five starts if it weren't so darn expensive
for this much money
much more even toned
a little goes a long way
you needed to give it more time.
fading dark spots takes way longer than a month even the kind of treatments that you can get from a salon
it has given my skin an overall more even skin tone
even i feel like my skin"s texture looks a little bit better
so far so good.
you only need to use very little product
the product for me lasts much longer this way.
it seems to help even out my skin tone.
it feels like it is removing even more dirt
it's certainly too expensive to waste
before i say more
my makeup seems to look better when i apply it now because of how even my skin is
i still have way more than half the bottle left
a lot goes a long way
while people usually think i'm 10 to 15 years younger than i am
i wish it was less expensive
my make-up goes on so much better
i must admitt my self esteem is a little better as a result
now i have a much more even skin tone
it was making me even more oily
the gel lasts me longer though
my face looks so much better since using this line
the bottle lasts so long also.
it works well with it
no need to put on a lot of product because a little goes a long way
i am barely half way done with the product
because i love it so much
another big plus is that it may seem expensive to some
a little goes a long way.
makes my life so much easier.
my skin has been having a very rough time lately.
made it slightly worse
a little covers so much surface
a little goes a long way for the price
i do think that replacing my old cleanser with something lighter
never notice a tight feeling like some other products
you use very little so it lasts a long time.
it has lasted quite a while, too.
a little goes a long way too
a little goes a long way
my skin has improved so much over the past week that i've stopped wearing foundation because i don't need to
my skin has improved so much with the use of this cleanser
i might switch since i do wake up a little greasy
this cleanser has much more substance to it
my face has never looked better or felt better.
which i love so far
a little bit goes a long way
you can get a lot out of 1 or 2 pumps so the product lasts a long time
my skin looks and feels so much better.
other than that it is a great face wash.
probably more what i would call a lotion
i don't mind it much in winter
probably better to try out the lighter version of this during summer time
they appear slightly better because they are more hydrated
i know the price can be a littler hard to swallow for most
it becomes so much better just after one application: it becomes firmer
it is a little pricy
my skin has never felt better
i cannot stress how much this product saved my skin
noticed my skin looking much healthier
so far, nothing can compete!
it takes a little bit of time to sink in
it's been fine so far
my skin is so much softer when i use this moisturizer than any other i've ever used
as long as you don't have very oil skin to begin with
have tried a lot of different lines
a little goes a long way
its ingredients are much better than what's out there
not nearly as heavy as it may sound.
it's been great so far
i will start by saying that it is way better than my last moisturizer it's lightweight absorbs fast
not too much, not too less.
a little goes a long way
during winter my skin needs so much more
for those who prefer a little more scent
feels 100x better than it has in a long time
feels clean& a little goes a long way.
a little goes a long way as well
can make this moisturizer go a longer way on my skin
as i've gotten older i am more combination
a little goes a long way
with the more expensive ones
it is pumping a little more than needed
just a little goes a long way!
a little goes a long way.
the more i've been using it the more i like it.
all of them pretty much work the same
first, i need very little.
my skin is brighter too.
because i am more on the normal-to-combination side
you only need to use a little
so far i like it
you need a very little bit
so far i like it
my skin is becoming more even and pretty.
my skin does look much better
it is a little bit expensive
not too heavy and not too light.
this smells even better
i am going to give it a little more time and see.
i needed this consistency for colder times of the year
i looked far too oily
'd rather have a little too much moisture
skin looks more refreshed than it has all winter long
this product is a little too thick for me
not too thin- just right for normal skin type
my skin has never felt any better!
my skin is at least 70% better
also, a little goes a long way.
thick just used too much
during the summer it can be a little heavy as it is pretty thick
stays on so well
i looked significantly better to the point when my husb
i've never seen this much of a difference in my skin
my face felt better than it ever had
loved it so much i had to buy it
this made my skin feel a million times softer after just one use
it even has helped the little bit of redness that i have
a little goes a long way
the only down side is that it does not come in a bigger bottle
my skin was doing better than before however i was still breaking out a little
i still break out a little
my face no longer burns
my face no longer hurts during the day
it does leave a little oil on my face.
much more than you'd need
this cream feels a little too much
just use a bit less with my application
my skin has changed for the better
it's plumper and clearer and just feels great.
i'd rather have something that smells not good
rather than spending the same amount on something that smells great
a first the smell can be a little different.
one pump goes a long way
so far so good!
it goes on well
and, a little goes a long way.
not too heavy or great.
when i first started using it i noticed i would touch my face wayyyy too often
its helping my skin get stronger
i do find in the summer that it is a bit too thick
only negative is the scent although it is not too off-putting
it hydrates my skin- not too much or too less
a little goes a long way
i rub in a little bit
considering how little i use
a little goes a long way
a little bit goes a long way with this product
though be careful with how hard you press the pump
because it is very easy to get too much from it
my skin feels much better
a little goes a long way, tbh.
the formula is slightly different
got the bigger product to continue to enjoy it
i will definitely get more
you just need a little bit of this product
my skin tone is definitely more even
it was not a problem at all because of how well it absorbs
needed something w/ a little more oomph
my face is much smoother now!
nothing had ever actually been able to leave me without an oily or even too dry finish
my skin looks better than ever
yes it is very expensive, but it goes a long way.
so far this has been controlling this problem
you only need a little bit
it goes a long way
a little goes such a long way
only con is that the pump dispenses way too much product
a little goes a loooong way
the only thing is that it is a bit pricey
i will admit i was a little hesitant about buying this product since it is a bit pricey
that makes me feel much better about the price tag
so this may have an impact too
my skin also became much softer
surprised that even the stronger products from the line like the glycolactic peel
which is more than i can say for a lot of other light moisturizers i've tried
loved it so much i can back for it
even though it feels light
and a little bit goes a long way.
which i actually prefer more
i touch up a little less
now that it's a bit warmer i continued using this
it seems a little better
i wish it was a little cheaper...
i think i'm a little less shiny
i find myself using blotting papers much less often
a little goes a long way so overall it's a good value since the bottle should last quite some time
my face has never looked better.
i see how long i can make this bottle stretch i might feel better about the cost
my skin just looks clearer
not too thick you only have to use a little bit
it is a lot better
even my foundation goes and stays on better.
better quality than drug store
this mask provides results that are far superior to anything else i have tried
10 minutes seems too little a time for $83 a box
i've tried more than 40 kinds of mask
the price is a little bit higher
how could you let a guy's skin brighter than you!
while it's definitely on the expensive side
if you need more even
i didn't see that my skin looked much different than before
it was more than enough
my skin was even
i couldn't note much of a difference the next morning
you'll probably need a stronger chemical peel from time to time
it did help slightly to get rid of some of the red marks i always have left after a bad breakout
my lines are getting smoother
i switched from a more expensive br
this is a little heavy for me in the summer
so needless to say my skin was quite dehydrated the next day
i think that during the day it would be a bit heavy to use under makeup
a little goes a long way!
it absorbed into my skin better than another br
it's pricy but a little goes a long way
i wish it were less expensive
i will say it seems more like a night cream
i love it so much i caved
not too heavy and just a little goes a long way.
i would opt for something lighter
a little goes a long way.
it has brought so much life back into my face
a little bit goes a long way
" the fresh black tea mask does it better with those results lasting longer
the price seems like a good buy since many other creams are much more expensive at least outside of the drugstore
more clear than it has ever been
i generally just use it in the morning
i can see one jar lasting a very long time even with two applications a day
a little goes a long way.
one of the very few richer creams that i can use at night that doesn't run into my eyes
so much so that when i returned
have tired looking skin--no more
it also costs entirely too much for me to justify it
this provided good moisture throughout the night however it did make my face somewhat shiny
i love it so much
a little goes a long way
is a bit on the heavier side
which we "young" women need a little extra of
a bit too costly for me tho..
i only used a little bit
expensive but a little goes a long way.
gives a much younger look to my skin
a little goes a long way so make it last.
it's a bit heavier than some but absorbs easily.
a little goes a long way
have alittle lines im probably the only one that sees them
i actually loved this so much.
i will have to budget my money better from now on
however for the price i suppose i expected more
no, more than what you pay for.
never realized it was so pricey
the good news is that a little goes a long way
it has cleared and balanced my skin so much!
even though i do wish it were cheaper.
i also leave it on much longer.
including one i love this much
a little goes a long way!
the way i figure
it will work way better
unfortunately the cost is a bit much for what it actually does
too bad it costs so much!
it lasted me quite a while because you don't need a ton of product each use
it'd be worth it if the results actually stuck around for more than a few hours of progressively improved your skin over time
it does work well to help with a more flawless makeup application
the effects need to last a lot longer because there are just so many other products that do
a little goes a long way.
my skin felt a lot better the next day
i needed a product to make my skin brighter
my skin feels better after using it too.
it not only makes my skin look brighter
i would definitely recommend spending the money for greater skin
with this mask a little goes a long way!
it lasted me a lot longer than i expected
i just won't pay that much for it
a little goes a long way
maybe not for people with more severe skin concerns?
it is just so expensive !!
very much like the fresh rose mask
it simply worked better.
a little pricey for me to go out
it's the first mask i ever used that feel slightly uncomfortable
maybe even more than this mask
however i feel the price is a bit much
hydrating products do the same thing for much less money
i just have such a hard time paying that much for a mask
even if it is as good as this one
it goes on more like a cream
gets that little bit of "coolness" to it?
i don't like the cooling sensation very much.
i am thinking there are better options
whether i'd rather just use a night cream
so far the most comforting mask i ever used.
i wondered what i had done differently
this one is more
i think people are expecting too much from skin products
improve them to where the issues are slightly better than without the product
this one softens skin better than any other mask i have used
can use it more often
because i love it so much
did not give 5 stars only because the price is a little too much
since it spreads so easily a little goes a looooong way
i can say it does make my skin a bit more alive
a little of this stuff goes a long way
when i'm done with this i'll be more than happy to pay full price
this product has helped so much
not a long lasting result
i’m thinking it’s more likely due to the cooling effect because you can’t really otherwise tell
i still cry about it at night
it also lasts for a really long time.
for the last 5 years i have spent so much money on higher end make up removing wipes
doesn't get any simpler than this
pretty much just a pump
t lasts pretty long
my skin will not break out so easier as when i used other products
it reddens my face too much
then i tough i should buy something cheaper
a little goes a long way so you only have to buy this a couple times a year
so many of them are too harsh
its still more than enough to lather my face
so far i like it
which is more than enough to do the work
better than you expected.
i love it so much
'd say so far so good
even with a little amount
you only need a little bit so this sample will last me for many weeks
a little goes a long way
the more i used this the smoother
i also did notice that my complexion looked more even
but will work good on normal skin.
all it takes is a little bit
a little goes a really long way
this is by far my favourite cleanser.
a little product goes a long way with this
this stuff lasts so long!
this cleanser worked better for me than any other i'd tried before
love this cleanser so much!
goes such a long way
for the price you get so much for your bucks
i almost always feel like i'm using too much
not only does a little bit go a long way
a little goes along way which is great because it lasts awhile
my skin has never looked better
he is super frugal so the fact he keeps buying it over cheaper products says a lot
it's quite concentrated so you only need a little
a little goes a long way!
compared to how much typical lancome products are
other than that, it's pretty much perfect.
i love this so much!
you only need a little bit
not much product is needed so the price tag on this is right
my skin is in such better shape
a very little goes a long way
what more is there to say.
a little of this goes a looong way
this product goes a long way!
little goes a long way.
a little hard to wash off
a little bit goes a long way
until i found this little gem
has made my skin care regime a lot simpler than before
also the price is great because a little goes a very long way
it also leaves my skin feeling noticeably cleaner than other products i've tried
a little goes a long way for this product
a little goes a long ways
my face feels so much cleaner
my skin has never looked better
for my combination skin very little is needed
a little goes a long way
as long as lancome makes this product
a very little goes a long way
amount goes a long way
so you only need a little
a little about me: i have combination skin
a little goes a long way
so far after using for a couple weeks i really like it
at first i though it would be too harsh
very little goes a long way.
although it does sting a bit.
not tight like most others i have tried in the past
it last about a year because you need so little.
if you want a better result
a little goes a long way
when you use it a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way with this cleanser.
i found the tonique doceur much gentler.
it's pricey but a little bit goes a long way.
combined with visonnaire i now have more beautiful skin than i did when i was 21
which has gotten much worse recently
my skin has become much better
a little really goes a long way
after it's dried my face does feel a little bit tighter
i felt like i wasn't using anything too harsh or running to much
i'd rather spend a little more to have clean skin
liked it so much i never went back to try the oil version
i love too that it is in a pump
it's highly effective maybe too much so.
perhaps this is typical for most
the makeup i wear to work makes it easy for my residents to see me better because my features are more defined
while it may seem pricey
ever...maybe even better than soap and water.
$38 is too expensive because it can only last 1 1/2 month
hope it could be cheaper
is using it too after a long of working
i would mostly use this way though
the price is a little high
i don't put much on my face
take this cleanser with me everywhere i go even though it's bigger in size
a little goes a long way which is always great
it still takes off most of my makeup
it makes it feel fresher without the use of alcohol
it might be better if you have really sensitive skin
very light and a little goes a long way!
my skin is looking healthier than ever
it looks and feels more smoother.
it may seem a little pricey
you don't need much as a little goes a long way.
i got this initially when my skin was broken out far worse than it had in years
my skin looked better
a little bit expensive for the amount of product you get
some worked better than others
when i first discovered this product i was skeptical because there's so many oils on the market now-a-days
it goes a long way too!
it even reduced the look of my pores so much so that i feel comfortable going out with no makeup some days
so cheap for how much you use
my skin couldn't be happier
only use a couple drops though as less is more with this product
since a lot of products tend to do so
i realized i was using too much so a little goes a long way with this product
a little does go a long way
been so consistently shiny or seemed so healthy
did something more for my skin
although i think its way too greasy to be used in the day time
no more pimples no more dark spots
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way.
this oil helped to clear my skin so much
it has done wonders there as well
to me it's better than tarte's maracuja oil
sometimes something would work for a while
you face will be shinier for sure today
i would usually only end up with worse breakouts
i love it so much
also makes it less dull
a little goes a long way
as it is a little too heavy in my opinion to wear under makeup
you really don't need to buy a lot of this oil because a little does go a long way
see how long it lasts you
it also started to clear my skin bit by bit
it's on the more expensive side
only problem is i go through it so fast!
i love this product in so many ways
my nose feels so much better as does the rest of my face
it can be heavy if you use too much
s are now softer than ever
buy the bigger bottle of it as soon as i ran out of the little one
there may be better out there
it does take a really long time to absorb into my skin
either i'm using a bit too much of it
love this oil so much!
my makeup goes on so well
this oil has made it much easier
other than that i love this oil so much
it's brighter- not as dull as it has been- softer
both of which are much more expensive
if your like me buying the other size will have you in the store way too often
sometimes added it to my foundation
so much to the point where i had bangs for years
i also use a little on my lips
a little goes a long way.
a little goes a long way.
it never feels like it is getting better
like they are not reaching deep enough into my skin
this one is much cheaper
a little goes a long way
my skin looks better then ever
2 pumps is more than enough
a little goes a long way.
a little of this 2× a day, and i'm good.
a little goes a long way.
it absorbs immediately and you need very little.
i love wish it was less expensive
it goes on so smooth
it feels a little thin
my skin looks better
my makes my makeup better
my skin feels much better on my face
this has helped a lot with that.
feels so much better
the moisturizer works much longer
absorbs well, a little goes a long way.
my face no longer feels tight
i've found that as winter approaches it just isn't enough
it seems to have been making my moisturizer work more effectively
as well as giving a softer
over the past year i noticed my skin to be much more drier than normal
have noticed myself using less moisturizer than before
i like it so much
it feels much better
my acne was pretty much gone
a little goes a long way
the only problem i have is that the area under my eyes look more puffy like i'm tired
my skin has never looked better
not too long ago
this was helped so much
my skin looks much clearer
my skin has never looked better
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way, which is a good thing.
skin tone more even
feel this one absorbs better
go get it before more people find out about this little wonder
so far so good
i only wish it was a little more affordable.
i wanted something not too heavy since i have combination skin
any more than usual
you only need very little to go a long way
other than that, i do like it a lot.
one container lasts a pretty long time
is in fact too much moisture
works well use it as my under eye cream too
!..a little goes a long way
it still feels a little greasy at the end of the day
this moisurizer works great without being too heavy
just a little goes a long way
i just wish they had a version with higher spf.
going to be too much for combination skin
i still found that it made my face a bit greasy
this works so much more better for my skin
although my face still does get a bit greasy
i moved on to something a little different now
i sometimes needed a little more moisture than what this one offered
it would be too thick for me
25 is about right without feeling too heavy like the higher spf ones-this is packed with antioxidants
my skin is smoother than ever.
my only complaint is that it smells a little like suncreen
this goes on so smooth
it was a bit too heavy for me
my skin tone is more even
the texture of my skin is better than ever
it makes your face prettier actually
a little goes a long way which is nice
before that i've tried so many different ones
so far so good
once i realized that a little goes a long way
so far, i really like this moisturizer.
although can be a little too greasy in the summer
has a higher spf than most
for the winter months because i guess the old formula was more lightweight
i break out a little in others
smell is much better than straight-up suncreen
so far it has been great
it goes on well
i'll keep using it until i find a better one.
a little goes a long way
my skin has never looked better
i decided to try a product a little more expensive than the $4 clean
a little bit of the moisturizer goes a long way
no more changes for me.
every day i love this product more
my skin looks more even toned
it is better than the dramatically different moisturizer
so far so good
it can sting a litte bit in the beginning
so far, i am in love with this product.
so am always weary
my skin tone is a lot more even than it was before i started using them both
it has fragrance which i'd rather not have
so this works well.
i switched to youth surge though cause i needed more help for "mature skin"
it really makes my foundation go on more smoothly
it helps it to last even longer
even though the product costs a lot of money
this simplified my routine so much- i like that it is higher than the minimal 15
it seems like it will last quite a while
you only need a little
don't need to use too much
i've spent a year trying to find the right face cream with a higher than 15 spf
they've come a long way
more for me all the products are just great
makes my skin look better
didnt think there is too much difference
maybe after a longer time?
i can use it during the summer without excess oil while still having a stronger spf
i think there should be more of the product
i like this much better than the dramatically different lotion
superdefense is much longer lasting
i just look healthier
t is much easier to wear make-up
love the fact that it has a 25 spf too
so hopefully with time it'll help more with the acne
i've never spent so much on a cleanser
not too harsh on my skin.
a little goes a long way
skin is more even
the smell takes a little getting used to
almost like there's too much pressure in the bottle
nothing else has ever made me feel cleaner
i love you so much!
i tried so many really expensive drugstore
also you don't need much
it lasts long because you only need to use a little bit
even though it is an oil cleaner
my complexion has never been better
it actually feels like my face gets a little tighter
my skin looks much better and no breakout.
so my face gets washed perhaps a little more than other women's because i like to start with a totally clean face
not use too much out of the need to feel clean
either normal or a little dry everywhere else i better go with the balancing cleanser
i should find something more natural
it may seem expensive, but it lasts months.
a little goes a long way- just one pump foams up
also very foamy so a little goes a long way.
a little does go a long way if you use it as directed
nothing have worked faster or better then this product
so far so good
better than when i was using $30
much better than a lip balm.
it is still too heavy as a face cream for me
i couldn't be happier with the results
this cream improved my skin quality so much better in brightening
a little bit goes a very long way.
a little goes a long way.
ards far more than the free-for-all we've got going on in the us
a little really does go a long way
a little goes a long way too.
it keeps my face hyrdrated more than any other moisturizer i have tried
you don't have to use very much.
much has been said about the strong scent
you need only a little
it sits on the skin a bit more than other moisturizers
you need very little
i felt that this product sat a little too much on top
although i actually use it at night instead of day because it's a little heavy for me
i just got some more after trying some other br
works better than some br
it was just too heavy
would not be so good during our humid months--too rich for that
even though it is expensive
not so much that i wouldn't go ahead
their night cream is actually lighter than the day cream
thought this would be too greasy
hoping the scent would be a bit more to my liking
it absorbs much more quickly
i enjoy this product very much
nothing too heavy or light
the lines around the eyes are much less deep
it is a little pricey
i couldn't be happier with this cream
it lasts a long time too
think it may be more useful for tired looking eyes
just a bit of the cream
it lasts a long time because so little is used at a time
look better without makeup on
no matter how much sleep i got
the jurlique eye looked so much better!
i would have looked better
i do wish that the cream was a bit thicker
even more expensive ones
a little goes a long way
yet it works just as well as the junk filled ones
which means you use a whole lot less
its very smooth and lasts a long time.
love this product more than anything i've ever tried
if i wait too long
as i am getting older though
you just have to rub the product well in
just a little around my nose
i've tried so many things
i only wish they made a bigger tube of this stuff
only downside besides a little shine left behind is that you somewhat need a lot of product to get the job done
how much you get
hopefully the more i use it the less oily
beyond happy with how much this mattifies without drying
is because spreading this around on your face is slightly difficult
so far i've been using this for a week
a little goes a long way
love this product so much!
a little goes a long way
nothing is perfect though some days where i'm more oily it can still cause my makeup to run a little
just wish it was a little cheaper.
controls the oil better than any product i have ever used
it does leave a little bit of a smell
i think that's better than not using this product
a little goes a long way
that seems to work well
it is better than without it
in the winter it's works better 8+ hours of oil control
not cheap for how much needs to be applied
however i will still be searching for something better
i wish it lasted a little longer in my day
and a little spf is always a bonus.
you feel like it might even be too much
controls my oils better than anything i have ever tried
this works better for me than any primer i've ever tried
i wish it smelled a little better
but still much better than without any mattifier.
couldn't be happier with this product.
does not make my face even more oily than it is already
not for too long
don't notice my face as much
feel protected enough for the little bit of sun i get outside of work
here's the deal though- i'd rather have oil than wrinkles
my makeup lasts longer
a little bit goes a long way as well
keeps my makeup lasting longer
it was harder to blend my foundation
that is when i realized just how much oil this was actually preventing
i would even say my skin looks a little better since i started using it
lasting longer every day
i mix it in with my foundation to make it slightly more sheer
i find that it helps my foundation last waaaay longer
i love it so much!!!!
i also find my complexion is much more even after using it
which i like very much
you need only a little bit to apply to your face
you only need a little bit
that one is definitely more drying
so a little goes a loooong way
so many pros about this face wash.
a tiny bit goes a long long way.
he too likes the wash
my skin has never been better
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long away
a little bit goes a long way
stings a little bit afterwards
a very little foams up
concentrated that i felt my pores are cleaned so well yet no breakout
makes make skin feel much cleaner
it is much nicer when i touch it
tip: a little goes a long way!!!
a little bit of product goes a long way so the price is justifiable
others not so much
i've had trouble finding a cleanser that is strong enough
not too harsh on my skin
not too much is needed as it lathers well.
i love how little you have to use
you only need the tiniest bit
no matter how many different face washes i try
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way with this cleanser.
a little goes along way!
you only need a little bit
my regular lancome is more expensive
face oil it might be a little too stripping
since my skin changes so often throughout the year
but still it is a good one.
i wanted to try something cheaper since $35 for a cleanser seems a bit much
a little goes a long way with this product
it is much cheaper than shisedo
it's a lot less than before
my face feels a lot cleaner
a little goes a long way!
this smells better than anything i have ever had the pleasure of putting on my face before
a little goes a long way
one little thing that bugs me is that it makes my face a little tight afterwards
better than more expensive cleansers i have used such as chanel
i also feel like i don't need to use nearly as much moisturizer as i used to
love it even more when i use it with my clairsonic
a little will do the job
even with lots of makeup on.
other thing that i appreciate it a little bit goes a long way so this product lasts
a little of this goes a long way
a little goes a long way
still have quite a bit left
the results seem to improve the longer you use the cream
since i don't need as much moisture there
so far i really like it
my skin looks better after just using it a few times
not too heavy...works to smooth all day.
so far, so good.
as far as looking younger
too bad it isn't a little less expensive
as far as helping with fine lines
it only takes a little bit of cream
the only thing i was a little weary about was the thickness of it
i did see a little improvement in my skin
i think i would probably prefer something a little lighter for summer
my only wish is that it came with a higher spf-i am very fairskinned
as i don't have too many wrinkles on my face yet
but i still like it.
this eye cream can be a little expensive
who is older than i am has been using it too
a little bit goes a long way
the lines are a little smoother
i wanted to find an eyecream that is a little lighter than the shiseido benefiance one i used the past 6 months
use the shiseido wrinkle-care eye cream at night because it is much richer
not too close to the eye
a little goes a long way promise
i am liking it better than my usual go-to eye creams
so far, so good.
the product seemed so light
a lot more water based
then i realized the surrounding areas looked a lot more dull
the wrinkles aren't getting any deeper or any less
this cream also sinks in better than others
it works on men, too!!!
so far so good.
to 150 dollar lamer this is a nice middle of the road compromise
better yet i love how it awakens my eyes
though i think the primoridiale eye is a better value for the smooth results
i don't have too many fine lines
this seems to be working well
you get waaaayyy more than you need for both eyes
i feel like it does work more than other eye creams on the market
a little bit goes a long way!
very little to get results in the brow area
the formula has become a little thinner than it was
otherwise when i pump i get too much product.
it is, however, much cheaper.
while people usually think i'm 10 to 15 years younger than i am
after 3 days my eyes looked much better
unfortunately they are a bit pricey.
however i do know that my skin looks much younger than it could at my age
a little goes a long way
my puffy eyes are looking better each day.
have had no reaction to this product so far
my eyes seem to look better
only 4 stars because i haven't seen much of a result yet
this formula lasts a very long time
less than one pump is enough for me to cover the area around both of my eyes plus a little around my mouth
this one however has gotten me compliments since i started using it on how much brighter
my old eyes have never looked better!
i keep trying to find something a little less expensive
can already tell a little of a difference
my eyes definitely look a little more "rested"
it does feel a bit firmer
the skin is much tighter
fine lines are gone and no more dark circles!
what i can tell is that the skin better absorbs this one compared to shiseido eye cream
not sure though if it does something drastically different than a good quality eye cream would do
a little goes a long way
or maybe i used too much?
much better than the other high end retinol products outside of retin-a
i rarely breakout badly now
a little goes a long way
my skin looks better then it has in many years.
still can't use it more than that
this product has made me much more confidant to be bare-faced
so far my skin is looking better, more even.
so far only a little peeling
i no longer have to use makeup to cover up!
my skin definitely looked worse before it got better
now it looks very even
overall much more balanced
on my face not so much
have not had much success
something a tad more reasonably priced on my neck
my spots seem to be fading more quickly
so far it has done everything it promises to do
my skin is in vastly better shape since i started using about a year
haven't used long enough to see full effects
my skin does seem to be looking better.
much gentler than retin a though.
my skin is a lot brighter and smoother as well.
i wanted something slightly more gentle to use every night for more consistency
look a little better without all the flakes in the meantime
my skin got better
everyone said i looked at least 10 years younger than everyone else there
i needed a product that was not so expensive
also a little goes a long way
but even $75.00 is better than $150 for renova.
yes it is costly...but it goes such a long way.
i can't believe how much better my face looks.
the skin underneath looked so much nicer
this product has not made them worse
it couldn't be easier to use
everything is clearing up much, much faster.
so far so good
my skin already looks fresher
maybe my hope was too high to it
this has been great for me so far
they say my skin looks more like i'm in my 30's
i found that using this 2-3 days apart is too much for me
now my face is more even/brighter
i think the brown spots may take a little more time
it has helped my skin so much
a little of this may be because my face is somewhat used to otc retinols
i felt more burning
seems to be working so far.
my skin appears to have a better texture
my skin has never looked better
which makes them seem smaller
my fine lines seem to be changing too.
from what i have seen so far
it lasts longer than you'd think
make up goes on easier
just a little where i got a bit too close to my eyes
the actual bottle you buy is a bit deceptive as far as size
which is somewhat smaller
i will no longer need the expensive
it just keeps getting better
it is smoother and becoming more even.
it does take a little longer to see results with this than with other more potent products
i peel a little for a day or two
a little goes a long way.
this product is great so far.
wondered if this would be any more or less effective
i think i am actually getting better results than with the drugstore br
so far i am loving it
it is hard to get used to using so little
my skin is doing much better
i think the product is a bit too expensive
i needed to use a bit more than normal for good coverage on my skin
i give it four stars though as even if you use a minimal amount the product runs out too quickly
brighter as well as a bit more youthful looking
it took a little while for this moisturizer to grow on me
it gives just the right amount so you don't use too much
a little more than i usually spend on moisturizer
a little goes a long way
i do notice my skin looking more balanced
the smell is also a plus too
i just started using it, so far so good!
i feel i could get more out of a tube for the price
so maybe if you have mature skin you'd want something heavier
feels different than before??
makes skin so much softer
it was so much softer
never emits too much product
although i've tried some less expensive
i could not be happier
a little goes a long way
if some feel that they need a little more
absorbs better than the goats milk moisturiser w more benefits
yes it is a bit expensive
i need something heavier in the winter
i need something heavier for winter
look so much better
it has never looked and felt better!
non-greasy and a little goes a long way.
i need a bit more time with it
in the morning my face is more even toned
a little goes a long way on my combination skin.
needed something stronger than the oil-free moisturizer
do think is too heavy
even better than the deep tissure repair cream
a little goes a long way
my skin has never looked better!
my skin looks better then ever!
i wish it was a little more rich though as it doesn't leave my skin feeling especially soft
so only because of cost
i mean never looked better
sometimes i have to use it more than once a day though
the problem i have is that it runs out waaay too quickly
so far i like it
time will tell, but so far my skin feels good.
the packaging is a little difficult at first
if so you would prefer a richer cream like goat milk
i especially like this moisturizer better than the others in the product line
with time my skin has consistently gotten better
this was just too much moisturizer for me
it is actually brighter
i like it very much
a little goes a long way
this is never too harsh
it was a bit messy
now it seldom happens
disclaimer: your results may get worse before they get better
although with a full face of heavy makeup you'll probably need more than this
the negatives are that it is a little more expensive than i like
or just as well alone
so far it hasn't caused any break outs
i found this to be a much more fine
the scent can be a little strong
was breaking out more than normal
my skin has never been better
only need a little at a time
you must use just a little bit
also hasnt really improved it either
those products only helped a little
is better for the environment
which makes me think my face is getting that much cleaner
if it wasn't so expensive
the price is good too
really love them so far
my skin has never looked better
in 2 days my skin felt so much better
a little goes a long way.
you don't have to use very much!
it does last as you only need a little
i love it more with my clarisonic cleaner product
it is a little messy
it works better for my skin
my skin is actually more on the normal side after using this product for 2 months
it is pricey but a little does go along way.
it's pricey, but a little goes a long way.
i decided to try something less harsh
my skin was clearer than ever
so far so good.
my skin is so much better
my skin has improved so much
too much of the product can come out very quickly
it seems a little strong
*can be drying not much product is needed
a little goes a long way.
it usually gives you more than you want.
especially like using it with my clarisonic -- only takes a couple of drops
whenever i have a break out i use this a bit more often then normal- normal for me is a few times a week
i like the container because it makes it easier to use all of the product
i just wish it was a little less expensive
there are so many choices out there
that really hasn't happened since this product has become a staple in my skin care routine
my face is worse than ever
products tend to do more harm than good for me
is a good size too
it is more expensive than i would usually buy
why so expensive, though?
the bottle goes a long way
i know that it takes a little longer for a product to really start working
i think this is long lasting
looks better than it has in years
this stuff has made a difference in my skin even in the short time i've had it
i like the twist top which helps control how much comes out
as far as cleansing goes.. it's very good.
i like the a little of kate's products go a long way
it's cleared up my skin better than proactiv + without the harsh side effects
it could be a little better at taking off makeup
even progressed to their stronger 3 step acne line which still didn't help
i tend to use too much with this type of tube.
i found that drugstore products were only making it worse
a little goes a mighty long way
spent so much money
it was too much
yet it still feels so rich!
my makeup stayed on longer
it seemed that if i put on to much
maybe to make it look bigger?
plus make my skin look better
makes the products on top last for so much longer
it does work well
my face is definitely less greasy by the end of the day
having this with the rest of the kate sommerville has helped my skin so much
and so far, it hasn't broken me out!
only thing i don't like is how much money it is for how little product
t's been a little difficult to find the right moisturizer for my skin
sometimes in the winter i need more
keeps my t zone matte so much longer than before
$65 is a lot of money for 1
so far no irritates or acne from it
nothing comes quite close to this
even though it's suuuper expensive for as little product as you get
even my brother-in-law noticed my skin was more tight
i'll probably continue to do so because i love it that much
i needed to find a more intense moisturizer that wouldn't make me break out
i still like it
i love this moisturizer so much that this is my second review of the product
the only thing positive i can say about this life experience is less wrinkles
this controls my oil like nothing ever has
i would put five stars if it weren't so expensive
you can pump out a little or a lot depending on how much you need
and you should become one too!
it is not as bad as when i was younger because of medication however i still get acne
thankfully a little does go a long way
often i end up with too much product
i will say that i try to control the pump a little better because i think a little too much product comes out if you just push all the way
i love it so far
i really like her products so far
probably need a bit more help in the way of moisture
there was just a layer there making it seem so
i love the product so much
my acne has returned much worse than when i was a teenager
this product has changed my skin more quickly
my face is so much more clear
your skin will get worse before it gets better!
there are some people that are better with salicylic acid
as the instructions read start off slow with it because if you use to much it can be drying
i love that a little bit of this product goes a long ways
if i do get a pimple i notice this helps clear it up faster
so far so good.
my acne is much better
my skin tone is way better since i began using this
it does dry me out if i use it too much
they're so much smaller/lighter than what they used to be
feels better on my face too
it only seemed to be getting worse as i tried my usual cleansers
it figures that the only thing i've found to tame my acne is expensive
3 more would show up
i figured i might as well try something a little out of my budget
my skin has never been more clear
i would have given it five stars except for the fact that it dries up you skin a little
a little goes a long way
i could not be happier
when my face started looking better than i've ever seen it
that has gotten back to normal
maybe the exposure to more light or a reaction with my make-up?
i decided that since my acne was under control i would switch products to something a little cheaper
this will clear that too!
my skin has never looked better
i love this way better it clear my skin in just a week
so compared to the product eradikate from this same line my skin responds to this so much better
i just wish it was less expensive
already my skin is so much clearer
eventually, i got used to it so no more sting.
a little background on me
my acne has never been bad enough to justify using anything too proactive
after having a baby it seemed worse
my skin was even
this lotion has kept my skin clearer than anything else
i still have quite a bit left
some products are too strong making my acne worse
i little bit goes a long way!
i should have known better
i started getting smaller acne
even though it seems pricey
no more hard, red, and painful big zits!
i wish it was just a /little/ less heavy
t lasts quite a long time
my only dislike it that their is much product in the bottle
one use a day mostly because i'm not disciplined enough to do it at night
i used a little less than one pump for my face
a little bit of this cream
i've bought it twice so far
now that i've been using it for over a month i can say that it's more than safe for sensitive skin
they have either been too harsh
too greasy or just so so
this literally made it better
if anything it has made it look better
so far so good
instead this one so far cleared my face
i love the pump it makes it so much easier in a way
i would probably need something heavier during the winter
my skin feels better
has it feeling more plump
my only issue with it is that it is heavier
my skin quality looks so much better
little goes a long way
the effects are much healthier looking skin
it actually helped my skin so much
it was beginning to look more drier than usual
unless i find a more wallet friendly alternative i may pony up the $65 for the full size since a little goes a long way
i find i only need the littlest bit so this tends to last me upwards of 3- 3 1/2 months
for the price i think it could be a lot better.
this made it better
my skin already feels 200% better
pretty much every br
i tend to use it more at night
so far it has been working nicely.
this product is a little too strong for use around your eyes
a little goes a long way.
was better than i expected.
i would have given it 5 stars if it was less expensive
i love this one way more
lately not so much
my complexion has never looked better
my skin is healing faster than ever
although the product is a bit pricey
probably will have to switch to something gentler for winter
the cream is a little expensive
a little goes a long way so you don't have to buy it as often
like any skin product you may need to use this for more than a week to see results
a more even skin tone since using it
this helps so much
my skin looks better than it ever has: clear
so far my skin looks the same
giving this four stars instead of five just because it's a little expensive
much smoother and more youthful looking.
i think this is probably better suited for someone with normal to dry skin because of it being so heavy
personally i am going back to my kinerase c8 peptide because it's much lighter
makeup goes on so much better.
i tried everything-spent a lot of money in the process
my eyes looked younger with less lines
half a pump for both eyes is all it takes so price wise
it seems firmer also
it's been a long time since i've spent this amount of money on face creams since there are many quite good products at the local pharmacy however this eye treatment feels like silk
although this product is a bit pricey
little lines are gone and prevents deeper lines.
i think a little goes a long way
its double the price of most eye creams that do just as good as job
don't push the pump all the way down as a little goes a long way
the dispenser gives out too much cream so you have to be careful to not press too hard
a little is enough for both eyes.
my skin looked better than ever before
i do notice that my skin just looks a little bit better
you only need a little so it lasts.
a little goes along way
you only need about half to one pump for your whole face or it'd probably be too greasy
it looks like it could last quite a while
it doesn't have to be too much
for oily skin this might be a bit much
the oil-free version might be better
wish it had a few more brightening agents
a little goes a long way
my skin has never looked better
i give this an a+ for making my morning routine one step shorter
not to mention my makeup looks so much better on my skin
i typically don't spend this much money on a serum as there are others with just as many impressive ingredients for a lot less
a little goes a long way
though i first thought it would be too expensive to purchase
a little goes a long way
my complection is more even
quench pretty much saved my life this past winter
so far it's been good
it helps any moisturizer i put on after it work even better
i should probably give it some more time
the change that i am noticing seems to be more of a fundamental change rather than a as-long-as-i'm-greased-up kind of change
i will give a little more time.
it is a little pricey
one drop goes a long way
one pump is more than ample for face
a little goes a long way with this product.
also, a little bit goes a long way.
my skin has never looked better
although it is a bit pricey
a little goes a very long way
a full pump is too much
it seemed difficult to believe that something so thick could absorb
if it was more of a creme
my skin has never looked better.
more like an oil
this one goes on thicker
this goes on feeling somewhat heavy
a little goes along way
just a little drop covers the whole face.
so far i love them
i don't mind spending a little more
wish the amount of product you got for the price was a little more
what a change for the better
a little goes a long way.
which probably makes a difference
remember a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way.
one drop goes a long way.
have never found one that goes on so smoothly
feels better everyday that i use it
feeling so much better
it just gives that little extra bit of moisture
you need just a little
a little truly goes a long way.
don't use too much or you will be glowing for a long while
it will absorb fast if you use just a tad bit.
it will be greasy if you use too much.
only use 1 pump a little goes a long way
one quick pump is more than enough to cover your face
my face has never felt smoother!
you just need a tiny bit so while it may be expensive
a little goes a long way
have gotten no results like this
so far this is ok.
a little goes a long sag
a little goes a long way.
so so so goodx1 million.
a little product goes a very long way
my pores look better than ever
even though it's a little pricey
you only need a little bit though.
i've seen better results than with any other cleanser
a little goes a long way with this cleanser
my face has never been more clear
the best part is that a little goes a long way
it pains me that it costs so much
this product is a little expensive
reviews are accurate about a little going a long way
a little goes a very long way
i do feel like it can get slightly drying
my skin has never looked better
if you follow the directions a little goes a long way
it may be a little intense for some
i am going to have to try a less pricey product
a little goes a long way
it's a little pricey however
lasts a long time as a little goes a long way
i love the cleanser so much
it's one of the few i have used that my skin actually feels better
a little goes a long way too.
a little goes a long way
yet it`s a little bit too pricey.
may need to add a litle water too to help it loosen it up more
its a little pricey, bit it goes a long ways.
its more than enought
more than i can say for many others i have tried
a little goes a long way so get this tube
you use very little to go such a long way.
i think this is the best that i have found so far
i'd actually say most of the people leaving reviews here are using too much
a very tiny bit goes a long way
it's more than enough
though it is a bit expensive
more moisturized than with any other product i have ever used
the area aroung my eyes looks so much brighter.
none of them really showed much improvement
because a little goes a long way
a little bit goes a long way
making my skin look so much better
it was getting worse
it has little beads in it
a little goes a very long way
still have quite a bit left after all this time.
i couldn't have been more surprised.
also for those that feel the price is a bit high this literally lasts 5-6 months
it is a little pricey
the bottle lasts quite a long time
more than an ounce more
you only need very little amount every time
will be trying more of this great br
you only need very little amount every time
so that makes the price a little easier to swallow
it is a little pricey
a little goes a long way
a little of this oil goes a long way
so you better like that smell
but note that it does not foam very much.
has a more even tone
usually three pump is more than enough to cover your face
although it is a little more pricey
it is far superior
getting so much more product
make them burn a little
i know they are a bit pricier
faster than any oil i've ever used ever
i love it so far
it is pricier than others
a little goes a long way so a bottle really lasts quite a long time
i noticed how my skin so much different after cleansing
still a little prone to break out if i am not careful with it
i love it so much that i am buying all the products little by little
actually leaves your skin less-so than it was before
it's a little lighter than most cleansing oils
a little is all that's needed
add a little bit of water
it should last quite awhile considering how little it takes to actually clean your face
two pumps is actually quite a lot
if i'm not wearing as much makeup
compared to boscia it takes a bit more time to get all the eye makeup off
even though this stuff is expensive it lasts at least 6-8 months
now i rarely get any
a little bit goes a huge distance.
so far, so good.
my face feels so much better when using amore pacific products
love it, my skin looks so much better!
this is gentle yet strong cleaner i've ever used in 24 years
i held off a little on buying this because it is a bit more expensive
makes makeup application so much easier
good cleansing oil, but a little expensive!
the smell may be a little strong for my taste
more beautiful than it has in years
it is pricey, but a little goes a long way.
you don't need to put a lot on because just a little bit goes a long way
a little bit goes a long way.
if you don't mind spending that much money on a moisturiser than go for it
this is much better than my dr jart water drop- that one tended to pill under my makeup
my skin has never been better.
i've tried in vain to find something cheaper
my skin had become so much happier with less breakouts
the amorepacific one is a little thicker.
how well it goes under my foundation
though with a $100 price tag i think theres cheaper options out there that would be just as good
i still have a little shine
a little goes a long way
my skin has never looked better!
even though it's expensive my skin has been transformed as a result of using this product line
even during the winter when i could use a bit of a heavier moisturizer i just mix a few drops of boscia'stsubaki oil with this
few things i don't like so much
overall i do think my skin looks better after using this
my skin looks better than ever
my skin looks better at 30 then it did at 20
if i ever found something that worked as well with a better/no scent
a little goes a long way
none of them has been this expensive
continues to do so more
a bit expensive than what i'd like to pay
boyfriend loves it so much
it's expensive, but a little goes a long way !
my face has never looked better.
it also helps with the fine lines too.
i will say that a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way
i feel so much better
a little goes a long way
that you only need a little bit to cover your whole face
you don't need very much of this product.
although for the price i like clinique's moisture surge better
more expensive creams than this
i've never been one for buying into the "better quality higher cost" mentality
have noticed how much calmer my skin looks
this is a bit on the pricey side
also less clogged for some reason
you only need a little bit
i would find it a little bit pricey
you only need a little bit.
this is more than i can afford
more toned then before
so far it hasn't given me any extra breakouts
out of the many many moisturizers i've tried so far
the title pretty much sums it up.
i do tend to reach for something a bit more hydrating in the winter
i've never had softer skin like this ever before in my life
the greater thing about it is that you can use very little at a time
i would put a little more of this moisturizer on that part of my face
the packaging looks nice but is a bit too bulky.
so far it is very good
though it does linger on the skin for quite a while
a little goes a long way
my skin is better since i started using this
my skin is brighter and more even.
couldn't be happier with this product!
my texture looks waaaaay better and brighter.
one pump is enough for the whole face so my $90 will stretch a long time
more even toned skin
definitely has a more even skin tone
i got off pretty easy so far
overall my skin is brighter and more even.
a little does go a long way
a little bit goes a long way
pour a little bit out
i noticed better skin tone pretty quickly
my overall skin tone is much more clear
my skin tone is becomming more even.
this works better than the acne
my skin is so much brighter
my skin looked soooo much brighter after only using it for a month
my skin tone looks more even
skin tone much more even
so far so great
i don't typically pay this much for a product).
it's much better than the ole hendrickson?
a little bit goes a really long way.
you still get a lot of use out of the product
a little goes a long way.
not only are the lines very much reduced
a half of product only no more
a little goes a very long way
i still notice a much better complexion.
all my friend tell me that my skin it looks much better than b4 when i try to use some other product
only wish it could be a little cheaper.
it makes it very difficult to soak up every last drop
the other problem is that my face seems to be a bit more oily than before
it pretty much made my skin even more oily
my skin tone is more even
i just love the way my skin has improved over time with this product
am hoping that i see more improvement
it says you will notice a better complexion in a week
i just wish it were cheaper!
my boyfriend was commenting on my looks more than usual-
i wish this was a little less expensive
my skin tone is so much more even
it doesnt effect the little acne i still have
though it might be a little difficult to tell when you are on your last drops as it is an opaque bottle
my skin actually felt smoother after the first use
my face seems to be brighter
i find that i use a little less moisturizer
my skin feels plump and looks much better.
loved it so much
i do think a bit firmer
you have no idea how much you have left
the bf said it was a lot more than usual.
his nose is looking better
more than usual gunk came out
love it so far!
because the cleaner is not too
more than any other mask that i actually own
this is the one that works better than all that i tried
it only helps so much
probably need to use it a few more times to see an effect
it seems to work well however
i would leave it on longer than probably recommended
obviously used it more frequently than suggested
my nose is much clearer
i don't have much trouble with acne
t maybe deserves a higher rating
with the results the times i've used it so far
a little goes a long way
i always left the mask on a tad longer than recommended
mostly because my skin could take the added time
which tends to take a longer time to turn over
however, it does last much longer than you think.
nothing has ever worked well enough
a little goes a long way-no need to cake product on a pimple or bump
i did see the area around my mouth get a bit worse before it got better
others might find it too strong
it's almost too strong for me
have tried so many products over the years----pores no more-vacuum cleaner is the best i've ever used it is awesome
this helps so much to clear them
pretty much every pore is plugged
that helped a little too
nothing worked quite as well
there were sooooo many
doesn't cry out my skin too much which is good
it helps even shink some bumps on my face
the more diligent you are the better results you'll have
liked it so much i ordered some
t's pore no more vacuum cleaner surely did
wish it was a little cheaper though
it does absorb pretty well
my skin look more brighter
especially no break out so far.
deeper brow lines a whole lot better than most things i've tried
mine are more expression lines.....deeper.
be careful not to use too much.
a little goes a long way.
smaller quicker than with other products
my skin has never felt better
whatever it was my skin was desperately lacking
in less than a week, i see a real difference!
a rollerball would work better.
this had been the best at reducing all three of the many eye products i've tried so far
this product has helped so much!
dark circles are getting lighter
to start i don't have many or deep lines nor do i have more than some very slight crows feet
dramatically makes my skin so much younger looking
my undereye circles seem a little lighter
i don't think my eye area has ever looked better after one week of use of any product
the eye lift is just too much
the area around my eyes are much smoother
it feels much better and looks better too.
so far, so good.
my eyes really do look younger or my wrinkles look smaller
i do notice that a little goes a long way
it only takes a little
so the bottle lasts for quite some time
while people usually think i'm 10 to 15 years younger than i am
nothing worked for more than a short while
i think it makes my under eye zone stronger
this little bottle is pricey
my eyes just look better in general
brighter or something--can't really explain what the major difference is other than the lightening of the dark circles
i hope to see more improvement in the fine lines
it feels a little more oily than the original
i would pay even more for the results that i am getting
even though it’s expensive like all good products are
my eyes are so much brighter
my lines look better
think with time i will have a better review
maybe more like 2 dimes.
i do think the price is a bit much on all products in this br
they weren't much cheaper however i'm interested in the dmae theory even though it holds no real weight it's worth a shot
my skin has never looked better
i needed something lighter
like i am-using too much caused a couple of blemishes
if you had too much to drink last night
i can use very little
i think the key for older women like myself is also not to wear too much makeup
the overall appearance of my skin is what people see rather than what little makeup i wear
while people usually think i'm 10 to 15 years younger than i am
they do cost a bit
my skin tone looked more even
need i say more?
this just couldn’t make any more improvements than the other products were already doing
i tried to save a little money
his other products are just so-so
by far!..and i've tried a bunch!!
love all the perricone products so far!
my skin is brighter, tighter & more even.
everything is tighter and smoother.
though i think this is a little much for someone in their late 20's/early 30's i just might keep using it as a more preventative treatment
there are very few products i ever like enough to buy twice
this by far gets my vote
hope you enjoy it as much as i do...
aren't getting any younger
a little goes a long way
my tone was more even
make me break out more
i find it difficult to spend this much money on a serum without knowing if it'll work
this product delivers much better results
the two seem to work well
my skin has never looked better
feel like i have more even skin tone
so just be patient
even the first application of these products impressed me more than any product that i have tried long-term
it was more even
the results are far better
it does everything it claims, and more.
bottle lasts quite a long time.
btw, a little goes a long way!
so far i am loving it
my skin is tighter, less lines and smoother.
my skin looks much younger than that
little goes a long way!
i no longer need foundation
a little bit goes a long way
it can sting slightly
looks alot younger than my years
this just couldn’t make any more improvements than the other products were already doing
i've tried so many things to get rid of it
i like it better than the charcoal mask.
this one cleans better i think.
that painful bump that comes up sometimes or the little raise you see
making it even more effective
my skin was much less oily than usual
but the next day my skin is visibly better.
not so much a mask
i am in love & better yet... it works!
with this mask my skin is doing much better
i still get acne to this day though
even better than the ones my dermatologist recommended a while ago
i still have plenty of it left
after using it my face felt and looked better.
a little goes a long way
have used it 3 times so far
it has truly changed my skin for the better
pimples were going away much easier
in addition to the bottle lasting me three months it also has been get my skin much cleaner
my skin has much less acne
i think this is still cheap considering how well it works
it can be a little bit irritating.)
this mask works better
leave this only on your nose for more than 30 minutes
that is why i leave it longer
it's a tad bit expensive
you get a lot more for your money
i just enjoy keeping it on longer
the acne was getting worse
a little went a long way
a little goes a long way
the longer you keep the mask on
a little goes a long way
makes my skin look better
i think it keeps my pores smaller than they would be otherwise
my face already feels smoother
i'll see if i notice any difference this time since i've only gotten 1 breakout rather than a bunch of little breakouts
faster than this product
but not so much to where i am peeling.
i hope clinique comes out with a better one
have only use once but seems to work good so far
`ll have to use this more often
i love it so much!
this product has helped my skin so much.
worth the buy also because you do not need that much for a mask just keep in mind that it dries rather fast so put it on your face quickly
most of the time i leave it on for longer
just feels a little soothing
it seems to be working well
it does help with oil a little bit
not much for acne
the good thing is it does help with oil a little bit
that hasn't happened with this so far
you can easily pay 5 times that for a good mask
this company is really great with offering money saving sets more often than most
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way.
it seems to work well
a little goes a long way.
if anything i have seen more breakouts
pricey yes, but good to the last drop!
nothing has ever given me such great results so quickly
even before the vib sale because i just couldn't miss more than a day without it
i must say that i have been seeing my face look more bright
it does not feel like too much or ever greasy
so maybe that is also helping my skin out as well
so far nothing else compares!
my skin just looks brighter
more even i love it
seem more smoothed out
i don't think i can get a better result
it was too intense
my foundation was wearing better
much younger looking than my 47 years of age
i am now at the point where i feel comfortable enough just wearing a light foundation instead of my heavier foundation
is this better than other products?
yes this is way too pricey in my book
loved it so much
one extra tip is that if i have too much after applying
it is really expensive--that is why i have tried to find alternatives
it was rich enough to keep me from having patchy skinc
glides on without having to use too much
needed something a little extra
very little product goes a long way.
unfortunately it is pricey
my spots appear ever-so-slightly lighter
those are pretty much all i use
i don't see much of a difference in terms of texture
far more effective for me than even le mer
no matter how much i love it
better than i had expected
i gave 4 stars because this product is definitely on the expensive side
am so sad as it might be too expensive for me to repurchase at this time :
first i noticed how my skin did not sting as usual
my skin looked so much better
i found it to be rather refreshing
even better- my skin is looking almost flawless
had i known it was going to work this well
more even under my makeup
i've barely put a dent in the tube because a small amount of cream goes so far
$155 is quite a bit to spend on a moisturizer
compared to some of the less expensive jarred face creams that have not blown me away i think this will be a far better value in the long run
it has done a number on my fine lines as well as improving texture
so very little is needed
so far good in fine lines
my skin has never looked better!
my skin has never looked better
i usually do not see big changes in my skin even with expensive products
i think is a little expensive
better than any bb or wrinkle cream ever
it felt smoother in just that week of using it
a little goes a long way
(and i needed a lot less of it!)
i reluctantly went back to my usual skin care products which now seem completely inadequate by comparison
tone has improved so much that i sometimes get confused because it looks like i'm still wearing foundation even though i just washed my face
so far it's looking good
perricone for making a product that works better than anything i have tried from any other br
overall my skin looks "younger" fresher
my skin has never been better
the tiniest bit is all i need.
it was no longer dull.
would you rather have a product that works or one that smells good?
have yet to find anything better
you need so little
my whole complexion looks tighter and fresher.
i don't really have much in the way of lines or wrinkles on my face
my skin feels much softer
so far i like the way it feels
my face already looks more healthy
that seemed to work for other people too
i feel its better then many other similar products created just for night time
works better than any product i've ever had
very expensive but a little goes a long way.
i find my skin is much smoother
my skin has never looked better.
never has it looked better
i'd much rather have a fish oil smell on my face than put other ineffective stuff on my face
so maybe people who are used to scented products would have a harder time with the smell
or how much i put on my face
wish it was slightly less expensive though
this is the only product that has made a difference in my skin faster than any other
i saw a difference-more even skin
some say the smell is too much to h
my makeup goes on smoother with this
more like a medicine like smell which is not strong to me
i loved the product so much i had to try other products from the line
my skin is so much better
skin tone is so much nicer
i needed to use only a little bit of product under my moisturizer
with a more even texture
the smell is not long lasting
read fewer or at least softer lines
is more than tolerable
don't feel guilty about the spending so much money
and, you just need so little!
rather than sort of sad
some people have mentioned that cold plasma seems to smell a little better than it used to
this made my skin looking better in just couple of days
my makeup goes on so much nicer
instead of making my skin worse
this product has stopped anything from getting worse
plus i am getting a lot less acne with it.
without spending too much time
i never imagined one product could help so much!
my face looked better than i felt.
i still looked better than my tired body felt
more even in tone when using it
applying it anyway i found that this did more for my skin than most other br
the color was more even
the price is a little much
this works better than many 2 or 3 times the price
definitely sticking with it for a long time.
even though this is for skin types 1
i know it will help my dark spots as even better is an amazing line
that haven't faded much though
as far as brightening goes...i'm not sure.
still love it though
i look so much more awake
the overall tone is much more even
i feel comfortable now without foundation which i haven't since my early teens
the extra moisture in this even better formula is super
it'll be hard to find anything better
my skin is now brighter
it's also more even.
its a little bit too greasy for me to use as it
my skin looks more even
dark circles under eyes much better
not because i'm getting more rest
it is not too pricey
a little goes a long way with this.
it looks a little shiny going on at first
when i ran out i figured i could just buy something less expensive for the time being
i felt i needed to switch up a bit as i had been using it so long
who could ask for more?
it helps fade any new ones a lot quicker
not this year -- am using even better year round
much slower for old/existing scars
this was definitely better
a little goes a long way.
with the clinque even better moisturizer
i just purchased the even better moisturizer
given me a much better skin tone
have noticed that my skin tone is much more even
color for the better
its light enough for the summer too!
the quality of my skin keeps getting better
she had a much better result than i did
this product is a bit too greasy for me
so far so good
this product has even toned it all around
once i added the moisturizer i achieved even better results
this has great results for way cheaper than other moisturizers
this stuff makes it work so much faster.
this won't make you break out as long as you don't use too much
my complexion looks much more even in tone
there seems to be a lot in there
i think if used with the even better dark spot corrector it would work faster
hoping this works so i can reorder more.
overall my skintone is more even
my skin overall look much more even
more even looking than before
so far, so good.
a little goes a long way.
this has helped a little bit so far
i am loving it so far
i actually can tell that my complexion is getting more even
a little goes a long way
i still have as many brown spots as ever
my skin tone does look more even
post-acne spots go away even faster when you add the even better dark spot correcter to the regimen
i do feel that since i've been using this my skin is more even toned
in turn it looks more even
a little goes a long way.
i do use sparingly as a little seems to go a long way
the even better spot treatment
i feel like this product has even out my skin tone so much that i no longer need heavy makeup to make my skin more even looking
my skin tone is more even
it is greasier than i'd prefer
a little bit goes a long way.
so far, i've loved this product.
i love it so far :
i start notice that my eyes looks fresher.
i love this product so far .
it has so far softened my very fine lines that were starting to develop last year
it deserves more time
this is a great option for morning routine since its not too greasy
maybe it's still too early to tell... 1 week in.
it goes on so well
a little bit goes a long way.
i can tell my dark circles are way lighter!
the skin even a little plumper
after one week it has only gotten better.
am starting to notice more bags when i don't get a good night's rest
my eyes already look better.
just a little bit goes a long way.
i love this so much that i even invested in the big bottle
although it is a little pricy
it gets a bit pricy
better than most of the br
i don't think it has brightened up my dark circles very much
a little goes a long way
works better on younger age people to get rid of fine lines
decided to try it even though it is expensive
they are a lot lighter than they were before
it's a lot less expensive than some of the others that i have tried
a little bit goes a long way
makeup goes on smoothly--need i say more?
i think it does make me look a little younger
dark circles are getting lighter too
a little bit is enough
so far it seems to brighten the eye area
it is much brighter looking.
i also use a little bit around my lip line.
it is definitely better than ole henrickson
a little goes a long way
that has never been too much of an issue for me
after just a week my face looked so much smoother
what was i doing differently
a jar lasts a long time as you only need a little
ing that a more expensive eye cream must be richer
stickier did not hold true for this product
after trying so many department
the skin does feel a little firmer to me
this one is definitely better
in general skin looks much better
i still have dark cirkles
while i think it could brighten more
i like it very much so far
i suspect they might be using too much
even though it is a bit expensive
my face isn't too bad overall
pros: affordable, little goes a long way.
removes all my make up with just a little bit of product
it clears it up much quicker than before
this has helped me so much with my breakouts
've been using it for more than 5 mins so this review is legit
however for summer time i needed something stronger
finally switched to korres which i like better.
a little goes a long way
my flaky skin was gone in less than 2 weeks.
after trying a sample of this one i completely switched because i felt like this one cleaned better like deeper
the longer i use it the more even my skin tone is becoming
my skin likes it so much i've used it through the spring
find it to be better priced than most sephora lines
fair warning your skin will always get worse before it gets better
you don't need to use very much for it to be effective
it just makes your face feel so much more refreshed
from very little to a lot of it
maybe i was using too much product?
a little bit of this cleanser really goes a long way because it lathers very well
you may want something stronger
i would keep out of eyes because it does burn a little
much better than using make up wipes
a little goes a long way
cleanser are much more intense
broke out even worse
keeps my skin much not consistent
it's even better when used with a clarisonic
so far i love to use it in the morning
as far as my nose can tell
i love this cleanser so much!
as far as the smell as most people seem to be complaining about
i could probably get the same results with a much cheaper cleanser
no reactions thus far
it lasts a really long time
a little goes a long way.
my skin dries out a little more
t's a little pricey for what it actually does for you
i'll definetely be trying more from this brand!
i liked it so much
sometimes at night as well as in the morning
i so far really like this.
i didnt expect much from this product
i also use this little trick
my dark circles also seem to be diminishing more
bring peace as much as it has for me
it actually helps a lot
i no longer have bad breakouts
my face has never felt better!
neck have never felt better
my skin texture / feel has improved so much in that short time
i don't like using it during day though because it feels a little too heavy
nothing would clear them up for more than 5 minutes
it'll last a lot longer
a little goes such a long way
i love it just as much in the summer
only at night for more like a night cream.
i usually only use this at night because it is a little heavy
my skin feels better then ever before
it works so well
sometimes more when i need to
this works so well
this stuff is relatively cheap which is why i originally bought it-
this helped so much
other than that this is amazing
i love this so much
doesn't leave you feeling like an oil slick like some cheaper options
i still use it for my body though
it is much to heavy for my skin
it's now almost june (and much warmer!)
good for its price too
i took off one star because you can feel this on your face for quite longer than i would like
has helped my face so much.
it's also way cheaper than the other ones.
for me the 2 oz is a lot it's bigger than you would think
make sure to put on a bit more under makeup if you don't use that much normally
so much worse in the winter
would get that one instead of the bigger one if you're trying to save money
even though i have combination skin
i like it so much
i figured out that you just need to rub on your skin a little more
the price also makes me like it so much.
i dont use it on my face daily as i feel i have to rub it in a bit more than i like on my face
it's worked so good so far
a little goes a long way.
s might need something more stronger than what my face needs
it lasts a really long time
my skin looks much better when i use this
gives so much hydration during the day
this cream is perfect for all areas that tend to be a bit rougher
my skin improved within couple of hours- was so amazed by how it works so quickly
my skin is also so much smoother.
the three little wonders set
things are soooo much better
a little goes a long way
this was far better than any other creams
since using this product my skin has improved so much
looks better then it ever did
i wear less makeup now
it looks much better
if i use too much
my skin is so much better now
takes a bit of patience to rub it in
after the first use, my skin felt better.
even though i drink a lot of water
way more than usual
nothing more or less
spent big bucks on other products which never helped
much easier to correct the skin tone
my skin has been looking more even again
now he's getting a bottle as well.
i seriously couldn't be happier with the results
i seriously am getting more results with my skin than ever before by these 4 products
it might just take more time
it might not have been the entire reason for my clearer skin
it gives you a better tone in general
it makes it so much smoother
my skin has never been more clear!
looked better then it has in years
now, not so much!
it is red more often than i would like it to be
rather than long-term
my skin is super thin so maybe it penetrated through my skin more easily?
i needed more help
my skin looks and feels so much better.
use only 1/2 a pump because little goes a long way
no longer look red all the time
it is amazing how much less foundation i use
my skin has never looked better
after 12+ years of rosacea that just keeps getting worse
this really has helped me so far with redness
i prefer a tm over a foundation because its just so much lighter
i also love that a little bit goes a long way!
a little bit truly does goes a long way!
'm unsure as to how well this would work for more severe cases
a little goes a long way
it brings some much needed smoothness to the rough areas
my skin never looked better.
also the amount of product in that little bottle lasts a surprisingly long time
i look substantially more rested in the mornings than i did before
it sometimes just feels like tooo much on my skin
my skin has improved a lot in just a short time.
it just looks a lot better.
break outs aren't as bad or as difficult to get through
which is a little cumbersome
i do like this product so far.
my skin is far more smoother
my skin has never looked better
i must say a little goes a long way
i also hope more people try it
my skin is getting better
feels more new everyday
it takes about a week maybe
way way way fewer breakouts
i hardly ever break out now
even though i only used it for about 1 week before my derm switched me to something stronger
my skin is so much more even in texture
especially considering how much you need to use vs
how much comes in the bottle
i just wished it came in a bigger bottle!
you can make it last quite a long while
not only is it way cheaper
i definitely even think my deeper emerging wrinkles
a little goes a long way!
don't use too much under the eyes
i am seeing less of that now.
this has helped so much not only with my acne
so far no breakouts or any kind of irritation
haven't done much for me other than make my skin surface look older
my skin now looks much more even
which is not much
it makes my skin look 10 times better
i didn’t really expect to see much in the way of improvement
i couldn’t have been more wrong
more is not more
so far, the products seem to work well together.
a little goes a long way
so at night i place a little algenist oil
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way
it took longer for my skin tone to start to even out
after 40the little lines really start creeping in
also my skin is so much more even toned.
make up stays looks fresher longer
my skin just looks better
my skin tone is more even
i simply love the results i've seen in that very short time
i love this oil so much i use it morning
does change your skin for the better
my skin has never looked better.
my skin looks so so much better
i couldn't be happier!
sephora no longer carries this
a little goes a long way
other less pronounced wrinkles are pretty much gone
tighter look to my skin
which is too much for my skin to h
i eventually figured out that i was using too much retinol
you only need very little drops to blend it all over my face
its not too strong for my face which is good because usually i get flaky spots on my checks with other retinols
my skin is much smoother now
and so far, it worked really well.
my face is much smoother the next day
maybe i'm using too much
it feels more like an oil than something that's supposed to be drying out my skin
while some may think it is expensive
much more even-toned as a result
i can't say much about how well they do with wrinkles because i only have really minimal under eye wrinkles
so much better than using baby oil!
this is infinitely better than the josie maran cleansing oil
it kinda stings your eyes so better close it tightly
but i am, and my skin has never looked better.
i've paid more than twice as much for cleansers that did little for my skin
this product works even better, though.
it seems to last quite long.
my skin has become so much better
so far no break outs or irritation
a little goes a long way, as well.
so far i have no reason to switch brands.
i really like it so far- only need one pump
how a little goes a long way
'm a little leery of just using the oil to wash my face
have like them too
find it better than using a normal cleanser alone
so much bang for your buck.
it really doesnt control the oil as well as i hoped
it does better than a lot of things
it has definitely reduced the shine i normally experience
with those ages sometimes the pores in certain areas are a little bigger
just not for very long
especially at night when i can have more products on my face
i do wish that the price was a bit lower though
i just wish it was a little less pricey.
it is a little on the pricy side
one bottle seems to last quite a while if you only use it in your problematic areas
a little bit goes a long way
my oily skin has been kept much more matte than normal
my makeup lasts so much longer
it definitely works longer than anything else i've tried
even then it still keeps my face looking so much less shiny than it used to
if i fell in love i would be spending this much on moisturizer with no spf
the only reason i'm giving it 4 stars rather than 5 is simply because i don't like how heavy/greasy it feels when you first apply it
the mattifying lotion were enough to make my skin look not just clearer
i didn't find that it helped to make my foundation last longer as some other primers have
so far the product has made a great difference in overall feel
even though i have combination skin
oh and a little goes a long way so it will lasts!
this product does that and more!!
mattifies only for a little while
just makes my 55 year old skin look better
i even started to use some other pores no more products because i liked this so much
love the proes no more cleanser
it's too expensive for me now
this product makes my blush go on so much more smoothly by making my pores look smaller
a little goes a long way
minus one star because i would have liked a higher spf
my skin is much more balanced
no longer looks dull
i like it a lot but it is costly.
i think it makes my make up go on so much smoother
just a little bit worked on diminishing the few large pores that i have
its a little pricey but it lasts a while.
liked it so much i spent the $60 for the large bottle
my skin looks so much better at the end of the day when i use this
the product is just too expensive
skin tone is much more even
my face looked so much better
the ones that i do see are much improved after using this for just a week
considering how much i've paid in the past
it just works that well
you do not use very much at a time
i feel so much more comfortable showing off my own skin- makeup free
does very little to "control" oil production for me
i can tell that her face looks a lot less grissy
for lack of a better word
my skin keeps looking better the longer i use it.
a little goes a long way so well worth the price if you ask me
had no idea this is so expensive tho.
they always think i'm 25-27 when in reality i'm 10 years older
a little goes a long way
it lasts a long time too!
it was clearer as well
at night i just put a little more on.
my only gripe is that it takes longer than average to sink in
a little goes a long way
this so far has been an amazing product
the sample gave me 3 days worth of lotion because a little seemed to go quite far
the price is a tad out of my normal budget for such things
price is a little high
a little bit of cream goes a long way
a little goes a long way
less is more with this one.
have loved it so far
it made me break out a little bit
i only use a little bit and its good.
miracle worker works much better
i do feel my face is somewhat firmer
as long as i don't use too much my face absorbs all
you use very little of it yet it is light
a little goes a long way and i never feel greasy.
a little goes a long way.
never being too much
the sample packets lasted a long time because such a little bit goes such a long way
to bad its so expensive, i'll have to save up :)
a little bit of water still on your skin
that the product works harder
i am well over 60 and look much younger.
rich that i will probably always use it between this
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way
i also use a little at night on my h
only downside is that miracle is thicker
love the results even more
made a world of difference in my more mature skin
those long lasting lips that we all love
smoother it goes on very light
amazing, nothing more need be said.
it's a little heavier than hope in a jar
philosophy is far better than some moisturizers that cost twice as much
a little goes a long way
but i really think its too heavy for day time.
more even skin tone
a little goes a long way.
a little goes a long way
this product lasts for ages because you need only a little bit each time you use it
your going to like this even more
even though it does smell a bit interesting though
i used very little
wash more than once with the product
only thing is, my face is a little irritated.
i just wish the bottle was a little bigger for the price
t's a little hard to use if you're in the shower because it shouldn't be mixed with water for the best results
i will definitely be buying more.
a little goes a long way.
this gets every little bit of makeup off with ease
when i used my clarisonic i got really not much more make up off my face
plus it even moisturizes a bit too!
it is far better than anything i've ever used
gets no better than that!
i love boscia so much!!!!
perhaps some could get away with it
just add a little water
the thatcha oil did not do anything more than this one did for a much lower price point
everything seems fine so far
pretty much any kind
i love this oil so much!
just a little bit of water helps it to foam up
it removes every little bit of makeup
splash a little more water on my face
a little goes a long way
this has helped me so much
it can be a little greasy
so far i am liking this two step process a lot more than those cvs wipes
a little goes a long way
that a little goes a long way
whereas 2 pumps was better at getting off all my makeup
love it so much i continue to pay its painfully high price
i've realized that acne is less so a result of dirt/oil
more so a result of irritation
it also lasts a lot longer than my drugstore products i used to use
you need hardly any for a true clean feeling face with improved skin to show for it
i am liking this so far!
my skin is more clear than it's been in a long time
after a month of using my skin looks so much better
i've seen far fewer breakouts than usual
my face has never looked better!
using it in the morning has reduced the amount of oil on my face so my makeup even wears better throughout the day
a little goes a long way
still in love with it
more so than ever before
i like it so far
its definitely changed my skin for the better
does cause a little dryness, but not too bad.
it is so much clearer!
now my acne is under much better control
now my skin got a lot better
it is working so well
didn't want to like a more expensive one
my skins has changed so much for the better
a little goes a long way
so far this is working for me.
a little bit goes a long way.
so far im starting to notice that my pimples are slowly going away
i think my life may have turned out differently
sometimes just in the morning
my skin has never looked better.
as far as price
give it a shot because ever since my skin is so much more clear
this one seriously helps so much
nothing near as bad as it was
i loooove this so much!
i tried panoxyl and it made my skin worse.
i initially thought this was too much to spend on face wash
have tried many things to clear it up
so sometimes i feel like i might use more than necessary to feel like i'm using enough
they don't turn into anything bigger
a little bit goes a long way
would have gotten 5 stars
t was a little harsh with everyday use
a little bit out of the container goes a long way
a bottle goes a long way
this is a cleaner that doesn't feel too harsh
so far i've had them for 2 weeks i most say prefer this one than the clarifying cleanser
it's much more under control with this product
which probably compliments this to a degree
with a few of the big painful ones thrown in for good measure
also makes makeup application much easier.
although i still sometimes r
nothing so far has compared to this
honestly my skin looks significantly better
fall in love with it more
in just a day i seen some fast results!
this has not only helped with very deep
this kind of thing needs to be used a bit longer
so far, this is true.
the price is a bit more reasonable than some of the other choices
it takes something stronger than a serum to get rid of them
it has helped my fine lines a lot
this product leaves a heavier film on the skin than i expected
so better at night
a little goes a long way.
so far so good
to work on the little lines
a little goes a long way
my tired old skin is looking better that it has in a long time
therefore i have to take care of my skin even more
the rest of my face looks pretty much the same
maybe my skin is slightly tighter
she said it was the best product she's tried by far
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way!
the first couple of times i think i used too much as my skin was greasy looking
i now realize a little bit goes a long way with this product
even though i had mixed feelings about it
even better than un-wrinkle.
a little also goes a long way
much cheaper than surgery .
too bad is so expensive :-)
i now have a much more defined jawline
not even in my younger years
have made the comment that my face looks better now than ever before
way cheaper than plastic surgery
i looked less tired
now it has improved that area too
what's they make it out of to make it cost so much?
so many i barely notice what i'm using half of the time
my face feels smoother and looks so much fresher.
then that gets longer as we get older
my skin looks less tired than before.
i think they are waaaaay less noticable than they were a week ago
decided to try something that focuses a little more on firming of the face
they say i look less tired
so far so good
higher end isnt better than this
i couldn't be happier
he still gets breakthrough shine, but less so.
it has added so much moisture to my face
this ultimately leads to worse skin for me
look better than it has in a loooong time
i find this one way better than the sorbet one
my skin was just absorbing too much moisture
there might be something better out there
i wish it came in a bigger bottle.
my skin feels so much better since i started using this cream
almost no more little bump or texture of my skin
a little bit goes along way
a little goes a loooong way and it is very light.
it is not too heavy
lately it has been quite oily every morning when i wake up
although there is still oil there
when used before makeup this makes everything go on very smoothly
it's that a little goes a long way
you only need a little pump of this cream
i still get a little shiny by the end of the day
i feel like the more i use it the better my skin gets
i think it has more to do with the weather than the actual moisturizer itself
sometimes its good to switch it up
or just get generally red
not sure if it might be too much moisture for me in the summer
it doesn't enhance my skin or work very well in the colder months
you have to do it quickly because it does dry rather fast
much better than many big & expensive brands!!
not as much as i was hoping
how a little reduction went a long way
i've already gotten comments on how "well rested" i look
love this way more then any cream
works even better if kept in the refrigerator.
it makes my make up go on better too.
i've tried pretty much every depuffer on the market
for what it is, i haven't found anything better.
never felt they were doing much
even better, it doesn't irritate my eyes further.
quick moisture is what you need than go for it
it isn't quite as potent as i expected it to be
who knew a product so easy to use would also be so effective for those nagging under-eye puffy days
i feel like this refreshes about as much as any other cream
i figured one caffeine product was pretty much like the rest
since i love the heavier cream so much
much easier to apply eye shadow
looked way older than i should with bags under my eyes
at first i was hesitant since i actually needed something for my undercircles not so much on under eye bags
so far it seems to be treated both
this was just as good or better
with that its only a little
doesnt really help with too much of dark circles
even before adding concealer they look way better than when i wake up
i think it's because i've been getting a lot more sleep
my eyes look much better
so many others that sort of worked
i wasted so much money on useless products
even better after put on my night
$80 may seem like a breathtaking amount for so little
a little goes such a long long way
it is expensive, but it goes a long way.
a little goes a long way.
there is nothing harsh
i feel like my skin is just smoother than when i use any other product
but this product is even faster and better.
i love it so far
i felt like i had put too much powder on
two more people said my skin looked very even.
the one thing i can truly notice is my pores are so much less obvious
i like that little goes a long way
even thought i can't rate this product on wrinkle reduction i can say that it made my face look fresher
it is so much firmer
a little goes a long way
my skin just seems smoother
a little goes a long way -- apply to damp skin to stretch it a little
it costs a little more
imagine how good it can be over the long term
my skin felt oiler than usual in the morning
thought it might be a it heavy
i either end up not getting enough serum or too much
i just don't know that it is that much better for the extra money
it’s a little pricey but you only need a little.
i would rather spend $80 on something that really brings results than $40 on nothing special
the deep lines on my forhead have gotten shorter
i am not usually one to spend so much on a product
a bit too heavy for summer
though i wish it got absorbed faster
i can mix in a little foundation
better for everyday use
this works great without having to apply much.
a little goes a long way.
it goes a long way
so a little bit of product will go a long way
or worse, i'll be both.
it's slightly too thick for my liking
i like this cream very much.
a little goes a long way
since it is a little light
i like it so far
needed a better moisturizer for the winter months
as much as i disliked the price
a little goes a long way with this creme.
this is 10x better
two different sephora sales reps tried to steer me off it saying it would be too much for me
she couldn't have been more right.
since i start using my comfort creme my skin looks so much even in color
the amount that i use its very little
it is a little more than what i normally would pay
a little goes a long way
it's better to use this one at night
at the end it gets absorbed very well
nothing quite the same
i like it even better than the philosophy renewed hope in a jar
it worked better for me than other more expensive eye creams i've used in the past
it's a little difficult to get out when it starts getting low
a little definitely goes a long way
so it could last you longer than it has me.
none of them works as well as this one
my eyes feel better and look brighter.
might need something a little bit creamier in the winter time
would be nice if they repackaged to make it easier to reach the product
dont see big results as far as dark circles
love it so far
i love this cream so much!
a little goes a long way
you only need to use very little
so far it is better than other creams i have tried
a little goes a long way
normally i would hv never spent so much money
at night i want something richer
that feels longer lasting
wanted something a little less heavy for day time
after very little sleep
smoother than it had ever been before
my skin just felt better after putting it on
then you get way too much product out
i think it has more of a gel consistency
gives me better results than my previous steps
make up actually applies easier and doesn't run
a little goes a long way.
not any better than any other cremes
i think this does lighten them slightly
a little goes a long way
it does sting a little if you get it too close to your eyes
i only need to use a little so the jar goes for a long time
it goes on so smooth
i like this one better
it goes on smoother
still seems to pill up a bit
i feel jurlique would last way longer than this dior product
my under-eye circles looked way better
a little goes a long way.
maybe a little extra puffiness recently
this product makes my skin look so much more youthful
it is a bit heavy for day time use in my opinion
although i thought it was costly at first
my whole face appears more even toned
skin feels different, too.
i gave it four stars because it is so expensive
you may breakout a little at the beginning
my skin has never looked better.
i hate that i love this so much because it is really expensive
if only it wasn't so expensive.
has made my skin so much more noticeably smoother
much better than other serums i have tried!
it does repair the skin and helps it look better.
this one always gets the job done most effectively
i've gotten so many compliments on my skin since i have started using it
my make-up has never looked better
my skin looks significantly better
it is expensive but a little goes a long way.
more even skin tone
her skin gets better
much to my surprise my oily skin is more balanced
my makeup sit much more smoothly on my skin
i would rather spend the money for this serum that works for me rather than waste my
found my magic duo for my deeper lines
that work 1/3 as well
you have to use twice as much product with those
so that is a plus
my skin tone is more even
this one by far has to be my favourite
i even find my makeup goes on a lot easier
my skin looks so much better
my skin has a more even texture
though this product is a bit pricey
it made my skin so much better in all regards: tone
the results got better day by day
any hint of a fine line is long gone.
my skin has never looked better
have tried pretty much every product
there are products 3x more expensive than do less
my skin had so many little bumps
gained good results too
it actually made my skin a bit more oily than usual
much more even-toned
my skin does improve vey much
my face is noticeably better
my skin is smoother than it has been in a long time
make-up goes on much more smoothly.
my skin looks better than it ever has!
better then i could have ever anticipated
my skin looks much brighter
much better than anything ive used in a very long time
seems like very little
definitely smoother, softer and brighter.
i think it is a bargain compared to other serums that are much more
my skin feels smoother and looks more even toned.
so far i haven't had a problem by not using a moisturizer
could not really tell much about how well it was going to work because the sample only lasted a few days
as much as i hated to spend so much money on a serum
meaning that i have also had more breakouts
even the fine lines (not that i have many.
my makeup goes on so well.
so far i haven't had a problem with either!
my skin tone is more even in the sense that before
my lines are much less obvious.
i no longer wear foundation
given how little you need at a time
plus a little goes a long way so this lasts you for weeks
my skin is loving it so so much!
maybe younger or less stressed skin will benefit more
the price is a little much
it seemed a little greasier
whether or my skin is actually tauter it darn well looks it
so far so good
so far i really like it
scaly at this point from the use of too many products
unfortunately it does have a slightly uncomforting smell
some just made it worse
the fact that it primes my eye area for eye shadow means one less product that i have to buy
it does work well
so far i love it!
as far as the smell that everyone talks about goes
a little goes a long way.
you use so little of it
this might be a bit too much for your to h
a little goes a long way
at $95 there are probably alternatives that cost less
think it is more firming
this does help my eye makeup stay on longer
go on smoother than when i use the primer alone
it has the same smell as coldplasma possibly a bit stronger
i looked less tired
that a little goes a very long way
the little jar lasts a long time.
i wondered if i had been crazy to spend so much on eye cream
my eyes look so much better.
my area looks so much better.
my eyes definitely look better than they did 5 years ago
a little goes a long way
only surgery would show better results--that's my assessment
you need very little
i only gave it 4* due it being expensive for how little you do truly get
maybe perricone changed the formula
i’ve found that the longer i use it the better my under eye area looks—diminished
this eye cream works better than most i have tried
it still seemed to help.
it seems to make my other creams more potent or somehow work better
i like this well enough
a little goes a long with with this eye cream
it is by far the most effect product i have tried for the eye area
i know it is a little pricey
it goes a long ways
it seemed like it was way too expensive
i look far more refreshed then i did before
it will pill up if you rub too much
that is likely because they're using too much.
a little goes a very long way.
hopefully get something a little cheaper
not 100% difference maybe 75% better in reducing dark spots
it also last a long time because not much is needed
it changed my skin for better
a little amount is enough if you have a normal skin
this goes on very much like a lotion when applied
it makes things so much easier for me
i do wish it came with a bit more product without the pump
've found that on some of the more humid days it can be a bit much
i also find my skin has looked healthier
it's much much better than clinique's moisture defense spf 20 which is too heavy
no break outs so far so it's a keeper.
it is a little stingy if it gets too close to your eyes
this one is much nicer.
a little bit goes a long way!
it's concentrated so a little goes a long way
overall it is not bad.
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way
it is still lighter than face cream
with this i think my skin has actually gotten better
one full pump gives you too much product
a little goes a long way with this!
it's worse in the winter
very little cream goes a long way
i needed something a bit more powerful
a little bit goes a long way
although it can be a little heavy for summer
my face has never looked better
my face was much brighter
it also goes on very well under make up
i gave it 4 stars though because it is pretty expensive for what you get
a little goes a long way.
even thought it did help somewhat with daily oil control
thought i'd switch to the clear complexion moisturizer to see if it'd help more
so you get as much out of the tube as possible
it didn't leave my skin much softer than it already was
so far it's been great
most moisturizers only make the situation worse
it goes on so smooth
last for a much longer time than before
i am going to try more boscia products
everything is too heavy and makes me break out!!
a little spreads a long way
couldn't bring myself to spend that much
knew i had to have more
my only complaint is that it's a little too lightweight for winter
i also noticed that each day i would be more oily than the day before
while it is a little more work
this product is so gentle i actually exchanged it for something "stronger" because i felt like it wasnt cleansing my skin enough
my breakouts have gotten amazingly better!
this face wash helps them clear up waaay faster than on their own i definitely recommend it
my skin still responds so well to it
my face always feels much calmer after use
it's a little more expensive for what i'm used to paying
cause more break outs :
it makes my face feel a lot cleaner
gave it 4 stars because i have to use a little extra with the clarisonic to make sure i get a even distri
this face wash has saved me 100x better than without it
it is a little expensive
i've seen so much improvement
this works so well for my skin!
since using this my skin has felt a lot calmer
after using so many cleaners that just end up being too harsh
one pump goes a long way
though your skin may take a bit of getting used to it
thinking they will dry my skin out farther
been using this for a week so far
clearly i've been using all the wrong products for way too long
i cannot use this cleanser more than once a day as it is too much for my sensitive skin
even though the product itself feels a little oily
it seemed to leave my skin feeling more dewy than i prefer
it just looks so much healthier
cleansers are way too much
there is so much product in the bottle
i think using a cloth has better results than simply splashing water on your face
the fact that it's so gentle means that it takes longer to work
even though it's a bit more than i'd like to pay
the bottle goes a long way
it is definitely more pricey than i would like
for no real reason other than i'm a product junkie
i tend to break out more when i have my period
liking it so far
every day i see less
my skin's texture is much smoother
after using the clay cleanser my skin is soooo much clearer
i get so many compliments on my skin now!
this is helping a lot
this works better then anything i've found
i would always have little bumps all over even if the "big" pimples were gone
better than anything else i've tried
i need something just a tad more harsh
my skin has never felt better
wasting money on products that only made my face worse i knew with-in two days that i had found a product for life
my skin is way better
it really helps clear it up faster
this moisturizer has helped my skin out so much
alittle goes a long way
it was getting painful
so far i have been using it for a week
i do use something heavier at night
the clay cleanser actually works better if you leave it one for 5-10 minutes
a little goes a long way with this gel cream so use sparingly
a little goes a long way so my solution is to pump a little bit out at a time to try
control how much product i end up using
i no longer get pimples as often.
however i would leave my house feeling like i needed to apply more as my skin would feel tight
my skin is now less red
so you can get better results
a little goes a long way
i swear my skin seems smoother already
also, the price is not too bad!
it's too big now
you get way too much product in one pump
half a pump is more than enough for my huge face already
it has made my skin much smoother
it works so well on me too
skin always calmer when have problem if i use the night before
a little goes a long way
which really isn't that much
this helps them to become less red much quicker
usually clearing up skin requires getting worse before getting better
does so much more
for about a year now i've had little bumps all around my mouth
ren's products seem to be a little more gentle
well this work much better than any other i had used before
it makes my face feel much more cleaner
not as much as i used to
my face is so much clearer ans super smooth
they are pretty much identical from what i can tell
it absorbs well too.
my skin tone becoming more even
my skin is so much clearer now.
i've tried so many different things
you will find nothing better.
i love that a little goes a long way
not too light feeling
sometimes i wear it during the day too.
it seems to be working well
that seems lighter to me
you have to use a lot for it to peel well
my skin has been much more clear of acne which i’ve been struggling with for so long
i can see my pores have gotten smaller
i've gotten 3 masks out of it so far
will definitely get more.
however you do have to apply generously in order to have an easier time removing it which means you run out of it faster
i just wish the formula made it pull out a little bit more
made it easier to take off
my pores were so much smaller
it was only a little difficult to peel off
even the beginning process is not as pleasant.
make your face look more flawless
other than that i love it
yes it feels a tad bit strange pulling it off
it works so much better when doing this first.
it still gets a good amount
so far so good
see if it can grab a tad more
the mask clinged even more to my skin
take your time even though some people's results may be different some people will take longer to see results
some people are quicker
the more you use it
drink more water your results may come faster than you think
it's been lasting me a long time
the more i use it
get better coverage that way
makes my pores look so much smaller
so far, i felt that this works.
my skin felt better after using it.
it doesn't quite pull out as much as i expected
this feels better then anything i have used
wont use it more than its directed
his face have never looked so brighter
it is a little more on the heavy side
it goes on so smooth
a little bit goes a long way
the only reason i took a star off was because i'd prefer it have higher spf like maybe 20 or 25
the product lasts too so though it's expensive
as far as evening skin tone
i apply just a tad more at night before i got to sleep
i like that it has a little bit of spf
my face looks better than it has in a long time
a little goes a long way
my skin has never looked better
as long as you only apply a little
it doesn't come better than this.
alittle goes a long way
it goes on a little like an spf
it became worse than before
because it couldn't get any worse
a little goes a long way.
it absorbs a little more slowly than i'd like
finally decided it was time for a better/different/aging related moisturizer
fell in love with pretty much everything in it
i feel that my skin is much smoother with fewer imperfections in the past few months from using it daily
not too heavy, not too light.
you do have to work it in a bit more than the last moisturizer i used
a little goes a long way
no break outs so far
i need more moisture than i used to.
thought it was too expensive
a little of this cream goes a long way
it is rich, but a little goes a long way.
just what i wanted after trying a few lesser products
i like the actual product so much that i can get over the scent
the two together seems to be doing a better job than anything else i have used
actually does make my face look a bit brighter
it lasts you for a long
my skin has never looked better
a little goes a long way
if you use too much it feels sticky
a little goes a loooong way
more importantly the way it made my face look
the consistency is a little thicker
with continued use it has gotten even better
it has helped to even out my skin tone
the only thing that could be an issue is that it is a bit heavy
my be foundation has never stayed on better.
it is a creme so a little definitely goes a long way
my skin looks way younger/fresher than it did two weeks ago
my skin looks better than it has in a long time
so far so good
my face looks so even
i love it so far
it seemed to even out my skin tone also.
it keeps getting better
more even in tone
my face has never looked better
you might find something new that works better for you now
i kind of like them now that the red is minimal
my skin is also much softer
my skin feels much smoother
my make up goes on 10x better
after only a few days of using this consistently i feel comfortable to go without makeup
a little bit goes a long way
so far so good
a little goes a long way
it actually makes my skin even softer
i think my skin at 40 looks better than it has in years
more importantly gives your skin such nice tone
for wrinkles it's no better or worse than other products
my skin is definitely more smooth
after just one use my skin felt so much softer.
i feel as though my skin tone is more even
her overall skin texture looks a lot better already
she said it goes on so smoothly
i only gave 4 stars because like i said she has only used it 5 times plus it is very expensive
believe i see better skin texture
i know better than to look for a miracle in a bottle
i always wonder if my expectations are too high when i use a product with so many promises
but so far, so good!
so far i like it
so far it works as it claims
made my skin feel so much smoother
so now that i'm getting older i've started using this to slow down time
people still think i look younger than i am
i wanted something to do daily that would help prevent aging while giving my skin a little bit of moisture
- better then they have ever looked!
they all seem to make my skin a little clearer
softer than it's been in years
so far so good.
my skin definitely looks much better
a little more youthful/lighter
how long it lasts
there's probably nothing that will take away some of my deeper wrinkles
my skin just looks so much better -- firmer
you just need a little bit.
there are definitely better serums out there
has lasted me much longer than i expected
directions just need to be clearer.
a little goes a long way
my skin feels smoother than ever!
it lasts a long time too.
a little goes a long way!
i can see this jar lasting at least 2x longer than my previous eye creams
this one is more than i want to spend
i go through the cheaper creams much faster because i have to apply a lot more cream
keep reapplying more often every time i see fine lines
this is definitely on the heavier side of eye cream though
you need to use very little.
for me it has worked better than any modern eye cream i've tried
a little goes a long way.
you only use a little bit at a time
after about a month of use i have much less redness
only use a little bit on each eye
a little goes a long way
i believe it has a plumper look
maybe i am using too much product?
which makes the price a little bit more acceptable
i would have saved myself so much time
there is nothing better in terms of moisture
this is better than kinerase
the product is very thick so you only need a little
it did help a little with under-eye circles though
a little goes a long way
i find that with most murad products you need much less than you think
i went through the first tub very quickly since i used too much
a little goes a long way.
a little bit of product goes a long way
you can go a little heavier at night
already seems to have pretty much resolved my issues with undereye crepiness
i find that my concealer looks much better through the whole day than it did before i started using this product
you only need a little
a little on the heavy side
if you use to much of the product over time you can break out slightly because it is so concentrated
i love it so much
none of my old holy grails were cutting it any longer
most importantly, this stuff works!
a little bit goes a long way with this stuff
definitely less than the amount of toothpaste you would normally use
heavier products like this usually break me out
over all i like it i just wish it was slightly more hydrating in a gel form
this moisturizer has helped so much with that
this has calmed that so much
short of surgery there's really no way to be rid of either however this cream has softened them
it wears well under my make up, too.
this works so much better
because it seems that there's always something about a cream that could be tweaked a little
my skin has gotten more sensitive as i have gotten older as well
much-more-affordable st
just wish it wasn't so costly.
yet my face still felt tight
a little goes a long way
with the colder months going on i knew it was a little drier than normal
a little goes a long way so it last forever.
which i rarely felt before
initially i thought it would be too oily
i actually prefer a little light fragrance.
i could not be happier.
(better than the murad day cream with spf)
i gave it four stars because it's pretty expensive
a little bit goes a long way
i find my makeup going on more smoothly
i couldn't be happier
my skin tone looks more even
unfortunately he used way way too much so my jar diminished quickly
that wasn't too heavy or too light
a little bit of the cream goes a long way when applying it in the am
even though it is pricier
a little goes a long way
thicker than my usual face cream
was a little afraid to change my usual br
being 1/2 of my usual face cream i have to say in really enjoying it
in winter i always prefer a thicker moisturiser
it was actually ideal for the summer as well
this product was a lifesaver because my skin still looks great although i've had no time to do much more for my skin other than cleanse
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way.
my skin feels better and smoother.
mostly because i'd rather spend money on fun products
a little bit goes a long way.
she loves it so much that she will purchase it
a little goes a long way
which is quite a bit
i've never been happier than with this one!
you get a good amount for the price, too.
a little goes a long way.
i did find it better than other products
i love it so far
i often have to add more cream than i would with the one of clarins
i couldn't be happier
i never pay this much.
naturally started wearing foundation/bb cream much earlier than i should
a little pricy, but i liked the product
a little goes a long way too
my face has never felt better
i get a little more oily in the summer
i do think its a little expensive
the only negative thing i have to say is the price is alittle high
alittle goes along way with this product as well
a little goes a long way
so far i haven't found anything comparable
still "heavier" than hiaj if that makes sense
feel tighter than tight
a little too heavy for day time use under makeup
just in case it ended up being too much for my skin since it appears
it actually absorbed quite quickly
since it is thicker, you don't need a lot.
it is so light
they give the skin so much moisture
a little bit goes a long way.
so that i don't have to layer it with more products during the day
i still think it's too expensive for such a small amount
that got way too expensive
just wish it were cheaper
i much prefer to use this product
things changed for the better for me
you only have to dab on a little for it to do its job
my skin hasn't felt better.
a little goes a long way
it actually spreads really well too
i gave it four stars because it is a bit pricey than what i use
a little goes a long way
this is doing great so far
my skin has never looked better!
that i needed more cream
too bad i had the reaction.
it definitely had a more even coveraged that lasted all day
s the price isn't too much
so alittle goes a long way
i love it but wish it were a little cheaper.
it is very rich and a little goes a long way.
it seemed to cause me to break out more often than i did before using it
t may be that adding this one was just too much
i like the bobbi brown “vitamin enriched face base” much better
i love it so much
my dark circles seem to have reduced a little
3- the cream adds a bit too much shine for my liking
i've gotten so many compliments from people saying i look "refreshed"
how much it cost
love this so much!!!!
i wish it was a bit less expensive
since you only use a little at a time
it works even better than clinique's all about eyes
don't mind paying more for something that works
it is enough for both eyes
makes your under eye makeup look 100x better
it still works well
you only need a little bit
it's even better than a lot of skin care specialty store product
gets rid of my dark circles even more
it also makes my concealer apply much easier.
its thicker than most
when i use too much
plus, a little goes a long way.
a little really goes a long way
a little goes a long way
i usually throw this in my skin care routine around the summer months when they don't need too much care
this is probably well suited all year round for folks that have normal to combination skin
it does moisturize better than many others i have tried
you need very little which is a plus.
use something heavier at night
maybe only use a little
and a little bit goes a long way.
rather than feeling like i'm just placing something on top
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way which i'm grateful for since it's a bit pricy for a what seems like a tiny jar
my tired dark eyes are now lighter
a little goes a long way
wish it helped with fine lines a bit better though
the lines have gotten smaller
wish there was something as good as it that was less expensive
now after using this product for so long it doesn't do much
leaves it feeling so much smoother
i've noticed my concealer applies a lot better now too
a little bit goes a long way
a little really goes a long way
just a little goes a very long way with a clairsonic
how well a little goes a long way
the tube lasts me about 9 months because a little goes a longggg way
a small dab goes a long way, too.
a little, goes a long way.
this is the only face wash that i actually ordered a second one after i was done with me first in my whole entire life i always switched half way through beacuause either they had too much moisture too drying too much fragrance stipped my skin
so a little goes a long way
much softer since we started using it
if i use more than 2drops i break out
more so has cleared my acne slightly
much more even skin tone
i feel like my skin is more even-toned
this stuff keeps my face looking so much better
i look a good 15 years younger than my actual age
my face is looking better than ever before
a little does go a looong way.
started to notice how even
they have pretty much vanished
my skin is much more plump
take a bit longer to sink in
it is much smoother since using.
they just made my acne worse
i still love it though.
i've never found anything in drugstores or other big retailers that i love nearly as much
my make application goes on so well
a little goes a long way
what more can you as for
a little goes a long way
it felt way too heavy for me
even as good as it is it is about $60 for a 1
though definitely doesn't make my makeup last longer or my skin look more even
it makes my overall makeup look 10x better
a little goes a very long way of this primer/moisturizer
the difference in how long my make up lasts throughout the day is amazing
a little goes a long way
so glad a little goes a long way because of the price
definitely will be getting more.
a little goes a very long way
a little really goes a long way
a little goes a long way
love this moisturizer too much i tried to check out another moisturizer that was so expensive
little goes a long way!
i love this so much.
this product helps so much
a little product is enough for my entire face
the winter time can be a little tricky
a little goes a long way.
i've never loved a product more
plus, it's so much more than just a primer...
it it just the right balance in terms of weight--not too heavy
loved it so much i had to buy it
a little goes a long way
lasts for a really long time
a little goes a long way.
after trying many products over the years i had trouble finding moisturizers that were light enough not create an oil slick
it looks clearly less flawless when i don't use it
and a little bit goes a long way.
at first i thought it was a little pricey
my skin has become so much brighter
i love it so much that i started using it as my day/night moisturizer
i threw that foundation away when i ordered kat von d's foundation because i thought it would only look better with a better foundation
it looks way worse
my makeup goes on so well
smells great and does help my makeup last longer.
a little spreads a long way in a clean face
it does help it go on better
i didn't think it was so much better than any other primer
it didn't do much for me as far as oil control
it more than deserves a five-star
so much so that i'm confident enough to wear this alone without makeup
i no longer have this issue
a little bit goes a long way.
i couldn't be happier with this product
i love this product so much
my face looks fresher and my makeup lasts longer.
a little goes a long way
once i started using it consistently the better my face stayed hydrated
the longer my makeup stays
my life changed for the better
i enjoy the scent very much
the texture of this is thick so a little goes a long way
my makeup not only looks better
definitely stays on longer
a more even skin tone
this one is too good not too
a little bit of this goes a long way
a little goes a long way.
made it feel fuller
so far so good
although the 1oz seems like less of a deal at $63 than the
but either way, it seems pretty reasonable.
it little goes a long way
i love that it is in glass rather than plastic
this bb oil works sooo much better.
use a little at a time
i only have to use a little for a glowing
therefore causing my skin to create too much
i wish the packaging was a little more travel friendly
i just wish it came in a bigger container
this is a wonder product as far as i'm concerned
this product does way more than it claims.
a little goes a long way.
however this works better for me
as if it will be much too oily
i just use less
a little goes a long way
the packaging is lacking a bit though.
i almost sent it back because it was very much like an oil i've gotten from an online essential oil place at a fraction of the cost of this
because a little goes a long way
more than a face oil.
a little goes a long way.
it seems so much better than all the "mystery" serums
a little goes a long way
don't put too much on
haven't needed to buy more eye cream yet
it can get a little messy
my skin is looking much better
it actually has made my skin better
she says it makes her skin so much softer
her makeup looks so much better now since she has no flaky skin on her face
i don't feel as if i need as much foundation as i normally wear
that actually diminishes them
i see results in less than a week
a little bit goes a long way
there just isn't anything better for my dry
n the end it is a better deal than the less expensive one
much better than much more expensive br
i still a lot left
you are using too much
a little goes a long way
much of my concern has been fine lines under my eyes
this stuff is thick, so a little goes a long way.
it just doesn't quite absorb as well or lasts as long
my makeup has never stayed on better
my only wish would be if it had a bit more umph with dark circles
a little goes a long way
you only need to use a little
i’m fairly happy with this- my concealer goes on much smoother
i also do not get those little white bumps with this which is an issue i’ve had with other eye creams i’ve tried
a little goes a long way
after trying so many cheaper options
a little goes a long way
with how long it lasts.
a little goes a long way
it really makes the wrinkles under my eye look so much better
stores for much much more $$.
still have a good amount left in it
am in need of an eye cream that does more
my under eye area looks alot smoother all day
little goes a long way
causes little bumps so be careful
i generally take good care of my skin
well, it is nothing less than a miracle.
a little goes a long way
so my face has been dry for too long-i never thought of using bb products
think a little bit about all the money you are going to spend
this product i can no longer go without!!
require a little something extra around the eyes
the only reason i’m giving it a 4 star rating instead of five is because it is a little pricey even though it does last a long time
it leaves my skin firmer with far less lines
use very sparingly... a little goes a long way.
it cost twice as much came in packletts that would dryout
my skin has never been more smooth
which has lead me to stop using it so much
don't push too hard though
on my way to the sephora now to get a bigger tube lol
i mean really well mixed!!
the more you dab the more residue you will get!
only a little so the film isnt bad
they are hooked too
a little goes a long way
lasts forever since you only use a little bit
my makeup as a whole looks better
i slapped it on-- too much
little goes a long way with this stuff
she needs a little "help" with lines
this tightens so well that it takes 20 years off that area
i only gave this 4 stars because of the white residue issue when you use a little too much of this
if use too much
wrinkles as much as i could see them before
they work so well on my face
as far as the directions go
this is pretty much the most i'm willing spend
so maybe there's stuff out there for more that works better
i love this so much!
they both go together beautifully too bad the other one is so expensive
mix with a little water
it does take a little playing around with
and this product is so much more afforable.
i can put it off a bit longer :
of course only temporarily for probably a little more than half the day
don't use too much
it takes a little effort to get it right
at first i either applied to much or too little
make you look years younger
if you put on a bit too much
it takes a little practice to get the hang of using it
which has left me with very little elasticity in my skin
it works there too
if you use too much
sometimes even rub a little moisturizer with it as well
you use so little
makes you look 20 years younger
note: use sparingly, a little goes a long way.
more men need to know about them.
it does it well
just watch putting too much on.
it took 3 or 4 tries to figure out how much to use to get the best result without the white film
the less you use, the better it works.
realizing you need quite a bit of time for allowing the product to dry
only need very little
maybe they used too much
i think my skin tone is a little more even than before
my skin has never looked better.
have gotten much smoother
it really works a bit expensive
it feels softer as well
as far as face makeup goes
a little goes a long way
it does sting a little bit
look so much healthier
it is very light and a little goes a long way.
the only thing i've been doing differently?
there's much better products out there
my skin feels so much better
it works so well
it is also light enough
the whipped texture of this is so different than to most moisturizers i've tried in the past
on the days where i feel like my skin needs a little more i add one or two drops of an oil
more even skin tone
looks like you are not getting much product for the price
i actually used it as a primer too.
only a little bit is needed
i wish it came in a larger tube considering that one does not need much
a little goes a long way.
you just need a little bit
feels so much better
in summers it is way too much
my whole face also feels smoother
my face looks so much more awake after i apply this
are better for my skin type
it has never looked better
got a little one of these from sephora
it was a little too light for winter use
a little goes a long way
i feel like this is calming my skin down i just wish it stay wet a little longer
look so much smoother
if it feels sticky, then you used too much.
wayyyyy too much product.
when i run out i notice my skin becomes more dull
although i no longer get acne on my face
so the fact that this product worked so well
while i didn't notice a whole lot of difference in my smaller freckles
it also seems to be holding on to makeup much better
obviously it's not going to be as effective on older skin as light therapy from a dermatologist's office
i wish it were a little less expensive!
my tiny little wrinkle hasn't gotten any worse
it would be 5 stars if the price was a little lower
the only problem i have with this product is that it does tend to pill if you rub it in too much
the combination was simply "too much" for my skin
fine less are gone
the pump makes the lotion last a lot longer
my skin seemed somewhat smoother
a little bit goes a long way.
for me it was still cheaper than the laser treatment i tried that did nothign for me
my skin is more dull
i don't spend much time in the sun anyway
i did notice a more even skin tone
so maybe this would be a winner for people with a little bit drier skin
so far so good
so far i'm loving this product
it would be so much easier i'd this came in a 55 gallon drum
it has improved my skin so much that i barely need to wear foundation during the day
if you use too much it starts to pill
the first thing i noticed is my skin tone is more even
the only negative is if you use too much
a little goes a long way.
i am only giving it four because it is too expensive
i've gotten a lot of color while using it
very little at a time
so far i like it
made a mess even though i applied very little
fine lines do seem softer
it won't work better/faster if you apply more
some skins absorb more/quicker than others
it seems to be much more effective that way too
also lasts quite awhile.
this product can only do so much
i cover them the same way as usual
to be honest i didn't have much expect on depuff eye gel very much
with this combo i look much more awake lately.
as much as i love to try different beauty products
it doesn't seem help much with dark circles though
my only criticism about this is that a lot of times
i find the tube emits too much of the actual product
dark circles because i've been getting more sleep
i think it is effective because it makes the process faster
it is pretty cheap too compare to other eye roller
i wish it came in a bigger bottle with a couple of masks
i think that gives me a more consistent amount of gel
the bags under my eyes are a little bit smaller
it lasts all day too
i noticed it looked even better when i put it on over foundation or bb cream
i guess at my age, i need something stronger.
it works so well!!
how much better they perform over the br
pay much more for
id normally never spend this much for a moisturizer
a little bit goes a long way!
how much make up i use
i tried cliniques even better eye corrector
as a matter of fact i actually saw it worse.
i gave this a shot without really having high expectations because it was almost more than half the price
no one has noticed them either which is an indication that my eyes look much better
it also lasts for a long time too!
on days when i haven't gotten much sleep
it seems like this might actually be helping to fade my scarring
i only wish it still came in a smaller
you don't need too much
couldn't be happier best i've used in awhile
i barely need to put any on because my face has become less dry
no one is more surprised that it works
this makes everything better
i like it that much
works just as well for my skin
this little gem has lasted me this long so far
the price point is good too
good moisturizer however the packing is such that there appears to be more product ini the jar than there actually is
great product and even better value!
it does more than what it says
decent price point, too.
i almost feel as if this product has made the texture of my skin better over time
my skin has never been better
the only thing i would like better
is if it came in a pump rather than a jar
can be built to be more intense
i think i just might make the switch from my usual
its better than other moisturizers much more expensive
and a little goes a long way :)
i don't have to use very much for it to go a long way
the only problem is i think it might be making my acne worse
well finally, this one actually works.
no more dark circles
my eyes look better than i even expected
looks so much better
just recently stopped to try the caudalie the cru eye cream which is a little cheaper
it works better than any lip plumper i ever used really enhance my lips
i told him it was way too expensive however
the wrinkles were really getting worse around my eyes
my lines are less.
little goes a long way.
in two days my eyes looked better
a little goes a way long way
is the only one that really got better my lip skin
i would like something more
a little goes a long way
t's really not as pricey as it appears
it takes so little, it lasts a long time.
it just does not seem to be helping much with dark circles
was greatly surprised to find out it was as good or better than the $600
my skin was considerably more plumped
i like the new one better
a little goes a long way
"don't use too much
so far, i'm using it on eye areas.
too soon to tell if it improves signs of aging.
liked everything about it buy its just too expensive
i do not think this eye cream is better than others i have used that are less expensive
not as much improvement
it's a higher end product and feels like one.
yet i'd happily use the caudalie in summer when want something a bit lighter during the day
they haven't gotten worse while using this eye cream
don't have that much of the wrinkles yet
the more you have to use
i look so much better
no more dark circles
it works so well
it goes on a little different
however it did minimize the very few fine lines i have under my eyes
i almost wish i had tried a few more creams before getting hooked on such an expensive one
i guess i'll find out in 20 years how well it prevented wrinkles
i tell myself that something less expensive will work just as well
i've tried so many different eye creams
i love this eye cream so much!
a little goes a long way
i like that my makeup is no longer running under my eyes
i like it slightly better
it also *feels* like it makes your skin tighter.
because of that i am still searching a good cheaper eye cream
keep getting better each month
i actually looked brighter
am actually glad i have no knowledge of how much cash i have wasted over the years
this cream more than makes up for all my lackluster past purchases
within just a couple days my eyes looked so much more awake
it seemed to run out way too fast
the combination of the two works better than anything i have tried thus far
my usually deep/dark under eye circles are much smoother
i never thought much of caudalie as a brand.
it helped only somewhat with my dark circles.
the lines are getting worse
the skin under my eyes is much more firm
as effectively or more so than any other eye cream for dark eye circles
a little goes a long way.
if it just could add more moisture
she loves this product so much!
even better than lamer eye concentrate
not so much for dark circles
yet there is still a lot left in the applicator
my eye area is much brighter.
my only criticism is you have to be careful you don't over-pump out too much product
& i've tried everything less & more expensive.
the skin around my eye looks much healthier
another plus - a little bit goes a long way :-)
and a little goes a long way.
how long it lasts
i don't normally spend this much on face products
like many i have skin that tends to break out
my skin has never looked better.
my only criticism is that it can get quite messy
oh perhaps i did like the previous packaging better
turn for the worse.
so that i don't have to turn to more drastic measures as i get older
it is far less expensive than than the $200+ cremes
just wish it was a bigger bottle for the price.
i could tell my skin looked less dull
there was just something better about it.
a jar goes pretty far
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way
this one works just as well.
love it so much!
my face has never felt better
even has a little spf
i need a little more
'd recommend more for someone with drier skin than normal
a little goes a long way with this!
a little goes a long way!
a little goes a long way!
which feels much lighter on my skin anyways
a little goes a long way with this cream!
am very careful not to use more than the size of a dime
without it feeling too heavy
i like that it has spf as you can never have too much of that :
so far, so good.
the great part about of it being so thick is that you use very little each application
already lasting my longer than my lancome renergie cream
i love this more than all my others in the past
it's a much thinner formula
that one seemed more of a liquid
a little goes a long way!
so far i like it.
which is pretty normal
but i realized i was using too much.
much too intense than the lotion
i can see that my skin is smoother
a little goes a long way
this product has definitely made my skin much smoother
they have caused more harm than good
i love this product so much
have so much trouble finding a replacement
it's the first one i've tried that actually moisturizes my eyes for longer than an hour
my eye area has never looked better.
a little goes a long way
so far i have so complaints
you need very little
it goes a long way
didn't expect much impact on larger lines
also, a little goes a very long way.
at first i was not a fan because it was a lot heavier
a little bit greasier than what i was used to
a little seems to go a long way
i don't have too many crows feet issues
a little goes a long way
a little bit goes a long way
not expecting much at all
really appreciate on those all-too-frequent days when i get less sleep than i should
i think amorepacific eye treatment does a better job
i love it so much i want to at least keep a small one just to feel secure
a little goes a long way with this product
it works on dark circles too
i tried straying away from this product to get something cheaper
i probably need more sleep
they've also given me little blackheads
expensive but a little goes a long way.
a little bit thankfully goes a long way.
it's been getting much worse this year
so far i am loving it!
this one is better
simply thought the more expensive the better
it works better than most
a little goes a long way
little goes a long way
it's a great product that is needlessly more expensive than it should be thanks to the arrogance of the container designer
also a little bit goes a long way.
a little goes a very long way!
t's about 50% less than it seems to be
it's a lot less product than you think!
a little goes a long way...
it did more than get rid of the fine lines around my eyes
also made the skin look more plump
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way with this so the price isn't that bad if you break it down for the time it lasts
very little goes a long long distance.
just a little bit goes a very long way.
it doesn't take very much
a little bit goes a long way
very little goes a very long way also.
i love it so much
how could you have gone so long without this?
it does seem a bit pricey at $85
little goes a long way- wrinkle sbegin to fade after 3 weeks
a very little big goes a very long way
so with just that i am certain that the bigger jar will last me a very long time
i am pretty sure it will last me longer than my usual $40 eye creams
normally my face is more on the oily side than normal
a little goes a long way which is good considering how expensive this is
i like this one better
has little bit of oil
i am hoping i can scrounge a few more sample packs of this to see if the results i "think" i see are real
it goes a long way
my favourite cream so far!
i felt my pores getting smaller
it is a little bit heavy for me during warmer days
much better than other products though
now i barely have anything
perhaps futureresponse will work better
my skin tone is more even.
was a bit drying but not too much.
i find that a little goes a long way on my combination skin
both to help it last longer
i think i can see improvement in my skinin less than 2 weeks
making my skin worse
cheaper products to find something that worked well for my face
i've never paid so much for night cream before in my life
there isn't much in there
a little goes a long way.
i loved it so much i quickly turned around
you don't get very much for your money
a little goes a long way
my skin just needs more care than it did before
expensive ones), but not this one.
this is by far
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way
this changed my skin for the better.
a little definitely goes a long way
although this cream seemed to work well for me
this product can sometimes be a bit heavy for me
have to say that my skin has never looked better
no other cream would even come close to soothing my face as this does
a little goes a long way
i initially thought this would be too much for my skin
it's too much what i was planning to spend.
$150 for something like this is just a little much
you only need a little bit- it can be strong if you use too much
t absorbs even better into my skin
i probably spent twice as much doing so
you will get better results.
i consider it to be an investment because you use so little of it at a time
apply very little to the face
i rarely wear foundation now.
the clarins' one has more of an oil feel to it.
my skin is so even
it's never been clearer or looked better
i've gotten much more dry lately
they also have a much more expensive line that ranges up to $500 for face creams
it takes care of that too
it helps a little with my pores but not a lot.
there is so much less redness in my skin
makes you look older
that you only need a little bit to cover your whole face
you only need a little bit
i see that my skin is a lot firmer
i wonder if the people with the scent complaints are using too much?
so much so that you can barely see it when i wear foundation
it's even better than i expected.
swipe to pay for this product because ive never spent this much for something to use on my face
i couldn't be happier with it!
no more black heads are growing out now
i realized it makes my matte bareminerals foundation look so much better
after using it longer
better feeling in fall
matte for a good hour or two longer than otherwise
feels a little heavy when i first put it on
at night i put a little heavier moisturizer on
the pores on my nose are so much lighter
so far i do see a different in my pores
a little goes a very long way
no longer stray from is clinque
now it's even smaller
so my life has been rather stressful
was hesitant on spending that much
but a little goes a long way.
it seems like its probably got silicon in it that makes the surface of your skin smoother
which just makes it look nicer in general
nose seems to be working better than the cheek
this product works to make you skin look a lot softer
those seem to be larger than the ones on the side
i barely ever wear makeup now
may seem to make pores look smaller
i no longer see my pores
my makeup stays on better
my skin also feels smoother than normal.
my face looks soo different my pores are so much smaller
not only have my pores gotten smaller
really makes them look smaller
i they do seem a little smaller to me
because it is on the more expensive side
to make it last longer
no matter how many times i blot through the day
if it wasn't so expensive i'd use it on my whole face
as my skin aged i needed a little more help than i thought clinique could give
more supple than it has been in awhile
i've gotten used to having more makeup stick to my h
it makes it easier for my make up to go on
much smaller than before
a little goes a long way.
makes my makeup go on smoother
seems to be actually making pores smaller over time instead of just the appearance smaller as other products do
if you've given up hope of ever having smaller pores
has also really improved some of the acne i get from time to time
they have shrunk down so much that i no longer need to use a "filler" on my face before my foundation
my face has never looked smoother.
as i've gotten older like many people my pores seems to have gotten larger
this has helped even more
a little goes a long way.
i find i need more than usual because my skin drinks it up so fast
i might be better off with some filler
just use a little each night.
t lasts for quite some time
just not too close to the eye
the smaller ones seemed to go away
i've gone so far as to talk to a plastic surgeon about getting filler
i still have lines
i feel so much better when looking in the mirror
a little of perricone's products goes a long way
it works better than any of the many other products i've tried
i dont know another woman your age or younger who has better skin than you
and now i might go cry a little.
my skin is much firmer and brighter.
the condition of my skin is much better after only a few weeks' use
works better for me than lancome genifique
this is by far the only thing that really does minimize the 11 creases
while people usually think i'm 10 to 15 years younger than i am
my skin is now more smooth
i love the results so far
possibly even makes a little difference in firmness
i realized that i no longer got compliments on my skin during that year
i believe my results are as good or better than the before
it goes a long way
so maybe a little pricey for what it does
i love the whole line so far!
my search for a better product is over
i still can slightly see them
a little goes a long way, but it is not heavy.
even the deeper lines have softened a bit
this is so light
so far so good
made my face smoother so hope it will continue to do well
it does seem to be helping with fine lines
wish it lasted a bit longer, but it is worth it.
though i am only 22 i feel like this little splurge is an investment to the future
i also love that too
you see the different in your skin in one week so far
skin never looked better.
it is a bit pricey, but a little goes a long way.
that it doesn't do much for my deeper lines
probably too much to ask for something from a bottle
i think it keeps my skin from getting deeper lines
this is expensive, but a little goes a long way.
at 59,the results so far r amazing!
my skin is much smoother
my skin was already looking better with the cream
my skin is better
so far i'm liking this product.
i like the pump so you don't use too much of it.
i also use a clarisonic everyday, too.
it does what it says it does: my skin is plumper
i wager the plumping i'm seeing would fill out lines quite well
from too much tanning when younger
my skin has never been better
too bad is pricey
the first couple of days i did not see much wrinkle reduction
it's harder to find this kind of product
a little goes a long way.
already i can see how much i love this serum
it is also a product i like better than the algenist
my makeup even looks better
more even skin tone
a little goes a long way
hope to achieve even better results
my skin felt more smooth all around
tone and color also better.
the whole algenist range seems to have it
more refreshed than it has in a long time
so far this has worked better for me than even the oils
now all of my girlfriends are buying it too
a little goes a long way.
it is expensive, but a little goes a long way.
goes on a little heavier than my day cream
hs a better tone because of using this product
after just one use my skin seemed to have a clarity that it had been lacking for a long time
i no longer have these problems.
i just love my new skin, tighter and softer.
'hope you like it as much i do
my skin never has looked better
not to mention that my skin looks younger than ever
algenist is by far better
as well as how it looks
it does seem to be a little on the heavier side
i did have to take away a star because i feel like it could be a tad better for the price
even though this cream is a little pricier than i am used to buying
price is a little much
have tried so many
makeup goes on smoother too.
my skin looks noticeably better.
even though it is more that i am used to spending
my skin brighter form just one use
so far, i really like this moisturizer.
a little goes a long way
still have lots left
a little bit of the lotion goes a long way.
s even feel a bit softer after applying this to my face
i came back to buy it because i liked the results so much
i doubt i would spend this much on a moisturizer
its a bit price though love it
this cost more than i usually like to spend
i doubt i'll buy this in full size as it's a little more than i want to spend
only one thing i am not happy about is that my neck line seems deeper after using it
surely my spots are getting lighter
i like this cream very much
this bothered me because i have purchased much cheaper br
a lot of creams are too heavy for me to use in summer
bought this because i needed something stronger that would help my skin look younger n help with sagging
nothing new but still!!
it makes it go on smoother and no greasy feeling.
my makeup actually looks more natural
even though it is pretty pricey
not too heavy in summer
i no longer felt greasy
my skin has never looked better
my skin has never looked worse.
so far, my skin seems to love it!
a little bit goes a long way
it hasn't gotten worse
it may seem a bit expensive
good news is a little goes a long way
the only bummer is this moisturizer does have a stronger spf smell than i'd like
has kept my skin clearer than it has been in a long time
need very little for coverage
as it is slightly heavy
my skin feels and looks so much younger.
i've never paid this much for a moisturizer
this one is lighter than the one without the spf
look older than i am
i look forward to more results in the longer term
makeup goes over it well.
knowing so little about it
such a compliment from someone who says so little
even the skin tone is so much more even
pores are smaller, and my skin is so much softer.
my skin has never looked better
day difference with how much smoother
a little goes a really long way!
buy more because of how much of a difference it makes when i apply my concealer
with a cream this thick i'm not sure of a better way to package it
also a little on lips works wonders.
it stings considerably if you get it your eye
it is worth the price because it seems to be way bigger than any eye cream i've ever tried :
this is more on the expensive side
somehow made my eye area even smoother
this is the first product of the very many that i have tried that has actually improved their appearance
a little bit goes a long ways
i noticed my under eye area is getting brighter thus making my eyes look so much better
i did not even realize my under eye was still a little dark
after using this eye cream for a little over a month i have noticed that my under area looks much more smooth
a little goes a long way
i started using this product not expecting much
nothing came close to this one for real results it lasts a long time because you don't have to use much
i think i'll be spending less money
i do see a bit of a difference in the overall appearance as well
at 22 i thought i should start trying to keep it from getting worse
lightens my dark circles slightly i'll be sad when i run out
loved how it makes my concealer go on so much smoother without pulling my sensitive eye area
smoothed the skin so much
not thinking much of it other than i'd use it until it was gone
i tried so many different ones
i love it so much
also, a little goes a long way!
too much sun chasing
for less than $3 i'm trying to practice the technique of "a little goes a long way"
it is a little pricey
a little goes a long way.
my dark circles are much lighter
a little goes along way!
which actually comes with sooo much product
despite not getting much sleep
i looooooove this so much.
love this so far
still have plenty of product left
a little product goes a long way
a little goes a long way
love it so much.
one less star because it's so expensive.
i loved it so much
definitely helped me looked more refreshed even without makeup
i like it better then the shiseido eye concentrate because it feels a little heavier
it might be even better than the clarins' i'm currently using
a little goes a long way
it seems that no matter how many eye creams i that have in my rotation
it is however pretty pricey
less is definitely more when it comes to this eye cream
a little of this goes a long way
this product last a long time as a little goes a long way
until i switched to this which works better for my needs
even better than clinique all about eyes rich
a little goes a long way
flake free so far
a little of this goes a long way
love all the products i got so much which is saying a lot since i generally am hard to satisfy
trying so many products
a little goes a long way.
this has no little to no frangrwnce which i love.
it has a little bit of a primer feel to it.
very little is even an exaggeration: i used only as little product just as to touch the skin
i've only notice it if i use too much product or don't pat it on evenly
it has lasted me a long time so far
not the deeper line
doesn't wear makeup with should work much better
one is worse than the other
say no more to benefit
others state that it does not take very much at all
just a little of whatever cream
with that being said if you us too much
if you use too much it cakes.
it worked so much better than trying to squeeze some on your finger
a little goes a long way toward keeping you smooth
it really reduced that
this product is a little tricky at first
look many many years younger
i did have a little white reside under my eyes because i used too much
i look much more rested.
don't use too much and apply quickly.
it gets especially worse
about the size of a bee bee or a little less
second time was a little better
i look less tired
it probably works best on lighter skin or under foundation because it does sometimes leave a residue which is light in color
so far i love it
a tiny bit goes a long way so the tube will last you ages
makes you look much more presentable
she soon learned a little goes a long way which is good because it lasts longer that way
residue is a problem if you use too much
made my eye area much smoother
it works so well
you should use so little
it goes a long way
be careful when you squeeze the tube as more than you need can come out fast
maybe others used too much ?
has only been made more of a focus as i've grown older
you only need the tiniest amount for it to work so the tube will last a very long time
you only get the residue some other reviewers mentioned if you use too much
i need to get more sleep
it works well just don't use too much.
it does take a little practice
a lot cheaper than an eye job
a little bit goes a long way
a little goes a long way
bit it does work
use very little of the product in order for it not to cake or turn white
actually makes me look more awake
would be nice if it wiuld last more than that
it does a better job covering than any other cream
even though it fills them in too
a little goes a long way
had been trying for awhile to find a good pore filler/primer so they would at least look better under makeup
when i start getting a little shiny
i prefer the clinique which is way better for my combination skin
nothing works as well as this to make your pores appear smaller
this is a very good product if you are in the market to minimize your bigger pores
i’m a little bit obsessed with this product.
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way too
so far i haven't used it on my entire face
better than any mattifying primer i have ever used
a little goes a long way
i apply after foundation as it tends to last longer this way
i only which there was more of it for the cost.
as i've aged it's only gotten worse
tends to just make the pores look worse because the makeup just settles in there
i usually squeeze out a little bit on my h
just makes my skin look smoother and brighter.
better than any primer i have tried
besides the fact that this product works better
you can use as little of as much as you want
this brand was just as good and less costly.
otherwise it makes applying cream products far easier
i do wish they had more shades because the light is very light
a little goes a long way
it lasts for quite awhile
it also doesn't cost as much as some of the other name br
a little bit goes a long way.
wish it lasted longer
it takes a little more product than i'd like to use
more for special occasions when i wear more makeup
so far, so good for now!
the only reason i gave it a 4 is because i really love the pores no more hint of tint more
my make-up looks better with it, and lasts long.
really does make my pores look smaller
blend out much easier
i've noticed as i get older my skin is just not as firm which seems to make my pores look a little larger
less is definitely more with this product
more often than not
goes way beyond that
don't mind so much
it's a bit more expensive
works every bit as well
it also seems to help with my makeup staying in place much longer
this leaves me feeling way more confident about my skin than foundation ever has
i don't honestly notice that my pores look smaller -- maybe i need to use more?
i do wish that for the price i can get a bigger tube
it just adds that little bit of "oomph" i need after i haven't slept a full 8 hours
it really isn't meant to perform surgery so the results won't last more than the time you are wearing it
it is not heavy like a foundation as some have suggested
it is so much lighter.
good for those days when you need a little 'instant perfection
it makes my skin on my nose look so much better
it has a much more even tone
it much better for your skin
which i'm more than comfortable with
if you are expecting this to go one like baby oil you will be disappointed as it's probably a little less thick than liquid honey
even my long wear foundation
normal people not a big deal probably
i love this oil so much.
it deserves more stars !!!
still not as good as this one
it gets worse in the winter months
i love this product so much
a little goes a long way
my pores seem to be doing better
although it is a little time consuming to apply it brings so much moisture to my skin
wish it was in a different bottle as it leaks a lot when travelling
i love this cleanser so much.
although is sometimes needs more than one go
quite a bit will often be left behind ok the face sometimes
so much better than using a wipe.
my skin has never been better
sometimes i need a little extra if i'm wearing more than my usual amount
my skin has never looked better
there is no better way to fight oil than with oil
i think this may be "a little goes a long way" type of product
i like that it still works on face after so long
most products are only good for awhile
got a lot softer within the week
it's a little bit difficult to apply
this product has cleared up my skin better than anything else i've ever used
so far the heavier night time oil
while this is a lot more expensive than 6 oz of a drugstore br
it lasts longer than other br
a little goes a long way
since it is more difficult to spread around than others
i don't like it as much as i used to
couldn't be happier with this face wash
i like this cleanser so much i had to try other skin products -
however using josie's products has improved my skin so much i will continue to buy this
now i splurge on $32 because i love it so much
the ones i had are considerably either gone
i also love that it has spf, too.
the only thing that could make it better for me would be if it had a higher spf
olay has some good ones
my face still became more oily than usual
that didnt work too well
perfect for the more mature woman whose skin is getting a little bit dry
a little goes a long way
it's cheaper than a lot of other moisturizers on here
a little goes a long way
have much more elasticity to it
a little goes a long way
little bit combo in the summer
to prevent from using too much
i notice my skin becoming more
while the shiseido one still feels better on my skin
if not a little wasteful
i feel like it could be better
a little goes a long way
i am always weary of trying anything new--
my skin is clearing well so far.
some people may not like it since it's stronger than most products
it barely feels like you have it on
it goes well under my makeup
a little bit goes a long way
also, a little goes a long way.
it does better on my skin than other richer
it's better than most moisturizers that i've used
i would have prefered they put a little more money in the product itself
a little will go a long way
still though i love this product
it also helps even out my skin tone
it also does that little something extra: it brightens my whole face
my foundation looks so much better
because i know i’ll be buying a lot more of this
it makes me break out more
the cream seemed to make my skin a tad bit more oily than usual
i like this lotion so far.
the consistency is a little thicker than the tester i tried in the store
i like that very much
although it could be a bit higher spf
overall, i like the lotion very much.
a little pricey, but a little goes a long way.
the moisturizer i was using before was a bit too heavy
i don't like the new formula as much
this i like more.
oily skin would probably not benefit as much.
a little goes such a long long way the whole bottle will last such a long time
you only need the tiniest bit
it works well with it
i love this product so much already!
it helps out so much
in my case, the oil helped my skin so much.
it differently is over priced
a little goes a long way
what i love about it is that it absorbs into my skin quite quickly
still love this as much as the first time i tried it
only problem i had was that my skin was a little too oily for this
only gripe is that is too doggone expensive
i love this moisturizer so much!
sometimes on really hot days its a bit too much
i now use it as a night cream too
it gets a little greasy feeling
make sure i use lighter h
so many great things from this little jar !
don't work as well as this
be careful not to add too much or it will feel greasy after a while
a little goes a long way.
i love this moisturizer so much!
so a little definitely goes a long way
little goes a long way
the only small complaint i have is that a little goes a very long way
i feel like if i apply too much
its very rich and a little goes a long way.
if its too rich for you just use less product
a little goes a long way
i'd have to say that it does leave me a little greasy looking in the morning if i use too much
my makeup application has been going so much smoother
everything blends so much nicer then before
a little goes a lot way so a jar should last you quite a while
my makeup looks better throughout the day
it's still got more than half left
the korres one is much more weightless
can see this lasting a long time
they can get patchy
makes my skin look much smoother
this one is soooo much better
i got this in a little travel bottle
first off, it goes a very long way.
a little too thick for the day
a little goes a loooong way!
a little really goes a long way.
my face has never looked better
i wish i had given it more attention
would much rather a pump.
"a little goes a long way" could never be so true
because it actually is concentrated
come summer it did leave my skin a little oilier than normal
since i haven't found another moisturizer that i like as much
it works partially it made my dark circles a little lighter at least considering everything else ive tried didnt make them better
they are looking lighter
first when i started use i was little bit worried it might hurt my eyes
i started to notice that my fine lines are getting better
they have been getting worse
i couldn't be happier with this purchase!
i've tried many products some good
my eyes have never looked better
very little crowds feet
a little goes a long way however it is pretty expensive for the amount you get
i looked less tired
have to use a tad bit more towards my inner eye
great value lasts about 6-10 weeks depending on how much you use
this is probably slightly more on the gel side
i think i might need to use a little less since it goes quickly
this eye cream was better than i expected.
how cooling it is on the skin-- however it does sting when i get it too close to my eye
definitely money spent well!!
it had quite a decent amount because a small drop can go a long way
it helped a bit with the dark circles
a little goes a long way so no need to glob this on
they are a bit lighter now
don't have that much to compare it to
it works so well
i found that benefit's eye cream worked way better at a much more reasonable price
this lightens them quite a bit
and it wasn't because i was getting more sleep.
so even though i haven't used this long enough to give an in depth review i already think it's amazing just from the compliments i've gotten
my eyes are so much more bright and awake now.
it has a plumping effect that works great under the eyes where with age we tend to get dark circles
i did feel this slightly the first couple applications
my dark circles are better
plus it helps it last longer!
maybe i used it faster?!
seems nice so far
waiting on more results
a little can really go a long way
finished it off faster than most eye creams i have because i loved it
i find just a small dab goes a long ways
circles are much improved
i would use this cream even with out the benifit of dark circles becoming more faint
as far as it fading after applying for about a month it has not
makes me look so much younger
i actually like it better than the bobbi brown one
this is thick, so a little goes a long way.
it has treated my fine lines way better than the other creams i've tried
also, you don't need to use much of the product.
i love this face cream so much.
a little goes long way.
a little goes a long way
this is nice because it stays on the face a little bit
this morning my face looks 100% better.
you may pay more
i feel this lasts just as long as if you are using a h
i still like it
i actually feel it has made my skin clearer.
can even make it worse
this calendula cream at first felt a little heavier than i anticipated
i will get more
s when they need a little extra deep moisture
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way
even more so now that i'm in my 40's
this is a very substantial cream for which a little goes a long way
definitely would say it is more of a night cream
a little goes a long way, too!
even though it's a little on the expensive side
works just as well if not better
this is much less greasy
a little goes a long way.
this is one of the few that started making my skin look better immediately
my skin looks more clear
a little goes a long way
i am often told that i look younger than my husb
the texture of my skin is so much smoother!
even then my skin had tiny little bumps all over
my skin has never ever been better
my skin has never looked better since using it.
the importance of this is that moisturizer does a much better job if it can get down into living skin cells
but so far i am really liking it.
a little goes a long way.
thought it would be heavy
never has anything been greater for my skin.
definitely decreased my pores all over making my skin so much smoother
definitely decreased my pores all over making my skin so much smoother
definitely decreased my pores all over making my skin so much smoother
definitely decreased my pores all over making my skin so much smoother
definitely decreased my pores all over making my skin so much smoother
definitely decreased my pores all over making my skin so much smoother
definitely decreased my pores all over making my skin so much smoother
probably also long term benefit as well
sadly, even at my age i still have those.
a little goes a long way!
the lines in the corners of my eyes are more pronounced than i want them to be
i've never really had much sensitivity there
especially if that area is affected more than the rest of your face
my skin has completely changed for the better.
i look so much younger!
which is more than i can say for other serums out there
it stings a little sometimes
you don't need very much
my skin looks younger, smoother and more tone!
my skin is smoother, softer and younger looking.
a little goes a long way
however i cant use it any other time than at night b/c it turns my skin red for a little while
my make up goes on so much better now
i dont sleep well so some days they look alot darker
i see alot of people talking about how much product comes out with each pump
i just use about a little less than a half a pump
it spreads sooo far after you put it on).
only product so far that has had any effect.
for the dark circles----not so much
i think it is a little pricey for what it does
way better than sleeping for an age and a day.
it does more to firm my upper eyelid than anything else i've tried
it's easy to pump out too much
only complaint sometimes too much comes out.
so my dark eyes have only gotten darker with the little to no sleep i get
they already look brighter
this cream lasts a really long time
the indicator on the side is nice so you know how much is left
if you want something a little stronger
i would say there has been better than a 50% reduction/lightening of the dark circles
gives more than i need
products can only do so much for dark circles
as far as dark circles go
no cream makes a bit of a difference
a little on the expensive side
have seen about a 60% reduction so far in my extremely bad
it is a little pricey
it is a little pricey
without even realizing it
spreads well so you don't need to use a lot of product
it seems to work on the fine lines as well.
i look less tired and my skin looks more even.
i don't normally spend that much on my skin-care products
perhaps in the afterlife as well
a little goes a long way
the packaging shows you how much product you have left
it's thinner than a traditional eye cream which i like because i feel like it goes on better
just wish it was a little cheaper
so far no irritation
my fine line has reduced a little bit
've tried so many expensive br
a little goes a long way.
t's a little more effort to get the product out of the tube than i'd like
its probably not that great for older skins
a little goes a long way
a bit lighter then expected
this lasts a really long time as well!
not seeing much of a difference
so, am off to try some items a little stronger.
i should have stuck with the fab 5-in-1 cream because it worked so much better
it does have a less than amazing smell
i didnt notice much at first
from what i've seen so far
i say keep going with this more natural anti-aging product to notice better looking eyes in years to come
i no longer have that issue
the a little goes a very long way.
so far this product works well
a little goes a long way.
i wanted something more pure
this is a pretty average eye cream.
i don't like how much product i am getting for my money
however it still did burn and sting a little.
no miracles so far but will stick with it.
i could see that my dark circles had gotten lighter
i swear this is better than clinique
made it a whole lot easier to conceal my dark under-eyes
so far, i like this eye cream.
so far a good under eye moisturizer
one of the better ones i have tried
this would be even better if they improved the formula to depuff bags under the eyes
a little goes a long way
my 54 year old eyes look better and feel better.
this cream goes a long way
my eyelids have never been better
which makes them look much less tired
so far so good.
i don't have too many problems with my eye area
while i still like that one
this one is way better
so leaving it on for a bit does wonders to my skin
which is why i love it so much
it was a little tricky to get used to in the beginning since you have to dampen your h
cleans your skin very well without leaving it feeling abused like some other products have done in the past
you get so much product that it lasts for a long time
i've seen people say that it's too rough
why people spend so much money on exfolikate when this has better ingredients
my skin feels much cleaner and smoother.
without drying it out too much
i like the laura mercier one better because i get better results
so far no burning eyes
probably about 6 times instead of my usual morning cleanser
so much more clear
it takes just a little bit that goes a long way.
healthier looking in just one wash
i find it to be a bit to abbrasive for everyday use however
not too harsh even in the winter
although i do like the pro despot plus from ptr better because its twice as strong :
the philosophy product is better
i think it may be a little much for everyday use
so maybe be a bit careful
it works even better
i also notice that my face is looking fresher
there are other choices i've liked better
i hardly ever wear makeup now because this has worked so well
my skin has changed for the better, since using.
skin does appear more brighter.
i like the little beads
have learned i can use it even more often
it just keeps looking better
i am reminded how little of the product is actually in the tube because i'm having the squeeze it down
f you like paying too much for a great product
i like this product very much
left her skin feeling much softer after just one use
it makes my face smoother and brighter!
gotten so many compliments on my skin
i couldn't be happier
has quite a bit of air in it
my skin has never been so smooth
this seems to even out my skin tone a bit
is it just me or does anybody feel like quantity is less than 5 oz ?
my skin is so even
so just a small amount goes a long way
i would need more than a few days to make sure this is going to be great in the long run
it could be a bit more gentle
find this to be better
it also foams a little bit
for example my sister doesn't like this very much
i think the results are much better
this serum has given me more than what i expected
have actually seen even better results with it than with the old serum
just generally healthier looking
even without being too harsh
the bottle is small but a little goes a long way.
so far so good!
i still love this though.
my skin looks a lot brighter
my skin is so much clearer
they say i look younger
so far so good
my skin feels better when using it
my skin is brighter and more even.
i still breakout sometimes
i like this so much better: the smell
with more time it might be 5 stars.
it is a little pricey
you use so little of this product so the price is justified
i couldn't be happier
i couldn't be more happy with how some past acne marks have faded in the last week
i am also thrilled with how many fewer blackheads i have
my pores also look smaller too.
my skin is brighter and looks more even.
my oil slick of a face is actually better since using it
not nearly as greasy as it usually is.
nothing makes my skin more clear
my skin definitely looks more full
i am 43 and my skin looks better than ever.
too expensive for no results
i feel so much more comfortable on the many days i don't wear make up
it was no longer being made
i gave 4 stars because it makes my eyes a little bit watery
i wish it had a nicer scent though
i actually like this better than the fresh start eye cream by ole henriksen
this helps out a bit
a bit thick but a little goes a long way.
so a little goes a long way
so far i like the results that i am getting.
this product brightened my eyes so much
helps so much on those days where i am so tired
i love it so much!
i feel they look brighter and softer.
it is much lighter than my night time eye creams which are more intense anti aging
a little goes a long way so this jar will last for a good
i could not be happier
every so often i think maybe there's something better out there
well i do not have dark circles as such
so far it is good.
am even happier that it has spf
a little goes a long way so this small jar lasts for ages
you also get so much
the spf makes my day easier
so far the cream is good.
a little will go a long way
it goes pretty well under eye makeup with little to no creasing
this was a little thicker consistency than others that i have used
i also noticed that i don't need very much
therefore a little goes a long way
when i do use it consistently i think it appears to slightly reduce the darkness
there is very little difference in "renewal" properties
so someone with very dry skin may need something more substantial or may need to use more than the small dot i use
i wish it had some more sun protection.
although pricey, you don't need much at all.
which is a little pricey
this little pot will last a long time.
a little goes a long way
more bang for your buck
a little goes a long way
it lasts forever because very little is needed
better than most other eye treatments
as time progresses i feel that i needed something a little above average to take care of the skin around my eyes since i've begun to notice a little less elasticity over the past year or so
the cream is thick, so a little goes a long way.
a little on the pricy side
i like this eye creme very much
it just takes a tad longer than other eye cremes i've used
my makeup goes on very nice on top of it rather than magnifying my lines
a little goes a long way
is much more nourishing than the spf 30 clarins one i also tried
have had no problems with it being too heavy or greasy it is a great primer as well
not too heavy all in one product
to me this feel very similar too the bobbi brown intense eye cream however its almost $20 less
the only downside it's way too expensive.
just too much money
i wish it was a little more affordable
and that so far it has accomplished.
a little goes a long way
undereye looks so much better than without this
have this little line under my eye
this was better than i imagined
i actually love that feeling rather than feeling a film on my face
i finally learned my lesson: there is no other gentle cleanser that is better suited for my skin
i know better now
this product is definitely on the expensive end
perhaps it takes more days to treat redness
a little more drying than my previous cleanser
that may be with using too much of the product
it is much better than fresh
a little goes a very long way
i little goes along way so bottle lasts a lot longer than most cleansers
a little also goes a long way
absolutely amazing…way better than the other 2
you need less than half of a pump to get a good lather so this bottle will last forever
you have to use half as much soap
most cleansers that it's better to use less
i couldn't be happier for branching out
it last a long time, you only need a little bit.
i've tried so many different things
a little goes a long way as long as you rub h
my face has never felt softer
have tried too many cleansers to count over the years
is more on the normal side now.
don't like it as much
as far as i can tell, it does just fine!
it also seems to go even farther than the previous versions--one pump is ample amounts of cleanser
i couldn't be happier
wanted something extra mild
as far as i can tell
my skin looks so much smoother
so far it's been very good
it did sting a little bit
it's 2oz bigger for just $3 more
my skin has never looked better
a little goes a long way
my concealer goes on so much easier.
there are less expensive ones out there that i have used that do the job just as well
remember a little goes a very long way.
has not irritated me so far
and a little goes a very long way.
my skin is loving it so far!
ivebeen using this for quite some time
lasts for a very long time
i like it better than my previous go-to
never had better results
very little needed to get the job done
while i haven't used it long enough to see drastic results i do believe my eye area appears brighter
it also feels a little bit heavy which i normally would hate
as little of the product as i was using
it is a little expensive
makeup goes on really smoothly over top too.
i just think i can find something for cheaper that does the trick
so far i love it and hope it works its purpose
a little goes a long way.
felt i needed a little something more to keep the aging process from catching up
not to mention it lasts a pretty long time
as far as firming- i can't really judge those effects
i am so happy i decided to get this eye cream instead of a cheaper one
they are a bit out of my budget
my eyes feel much less irritated
i really like it so far.
no matter how much it costs
a little bit goes a long way.
i think my eyes look much better.
i need to use a lot less
so far it seems to work better than others i've tried
makeup goes on very well over this.
i think i could find something out there that works just as well for less money
the skin around my eyes looks so much better from this product
i look less tired.
jar lasts a very long time
in less than a week i could see
for all the scarier things it doesn't have in it
applications only take a very little product
i gave it only 4 stars because i think the price is a little steep
the skin under my eyes looks 100% better
my puffiness is much better
it's much more affordable than some others i've tried
not gotten as good results
i do not get those little bumps around my eyes that so many other creams give me
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way
it is firmer and smoother than it has ever been.
the only negative id have to say is that its a tad bit expensive
so far, so good.
a little goes a long way
this is a little more lightweight -- though the pro of that is that you can use it for both day
a little goes a long way too with this stuff.
this is the only one that i've ever bought more than once
it may cost a lot
this has made it look better under makeup
tried other less expensive products that i didn't like as much
when i want a little more hydration i mix a drop or two of algenist face oil in
a little does go a long way
mostly everything i tried irritated my skin more.
my skin is smoother than ever
my skin is doing better than ever
which is saying a lot
it's expensive but a little goes a long way.
it may be a little on the heavier side
it hurts my wallet too much
i'll start off by saying it would have gotten 5 stars if it weren't so expensive
even though i love it i need to find a great substitute because it is too costly for such a little jar
however it was a bit too rich for my skin
the older i get the more i feel the need for more moisture
for my skin there just is no other
much better than the ren moisturizer i was using previously
i feel it serves better as a makeup primer than what it is intended for
the first week i could not see much difference
so far i love it
my skin looks better
before this product i was putting cheaper stuff all over my face
now my makeup stays on better
i like it so much i just bought the peptide complex
i also noticed that i'm using much less of this than my previous moisturizers
my skin looks much clear after 3 weeks of use.
this product line might be a bit pricey
i've tried so many skin care lines in the past
my answer to this problem so far has been full coverage make-up
caused more harm than good
this did work for me so far
so far i've seen a difference
so far so good
i mean i feel like i could have gotten more product out of it
granted you have to use a little more then they say
years to find something that could give me a little peace
believe this is why it's a bit more difficult for me to notice a change
i suppose in a few weeks the darker ones will start disappearing or at least lightening
my skin has never looked better
it might be a little pricey
def going to buy another to see if it makes the marks eve lighter
it has helped a lot
a little of it goes a long way
this product was more than i expected!
then the spot seemed to get lighter
other than that it smells good
after only three weeks of using this the sun spots are much lighter
my skin looks brighter and more even.
i've used pretty much all of the lightening products without much change
this one just seems to be different.
am really surprised about how much less makeup i seem to be using
which is better than fast and blotchy!
i heal from those so much slower now than 10 years ago
got much better results so far than i did with a dior product that was twice as expensive
i've only been using this product for a week so far
a little goes a long way!
i don't reach for this too often
if stronger smells bother you
just too much work to do for a good makeup removal
so much better than any cleansing oil
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way so bear that in mind
like so many other things
it isn't nearly as bad as some people are saying
the only reason i gave this cleanser 4 stars instead of 5 is because it is so expensive
a little goes a long way with this product, btw.
just the usual pores that i wanted to be smaller
my skin is much smooth
my skin looks better after 2 weeks of use
now that i"m getting older
softer than it has ever felt
it is way too expensive to use to take off makeup
i like eve lom or even clinique thdo balm much more
more than any other cleanser i tried
it works so well
i wish sephora restocked the smaller jar more frequently though
it's a better deal than the medium size.
there's so much goodness in there that any "residue" that might be left over is more than welcome
a little goes a long way so even though it is pricey
it does have a slightly off putting smell
so far so good
yes this is on the expensive side, but i love it.
the price seems a little steep for the product though
i gave it 4 stars only because it is sooo expensive
i love this product so much.
it was no longer painful
a little goes a long way
too bad it's so expensive.
i could easily see how it would be too much for oily types
though it does have a somewhat odd smell...
my skin actually felt tighter
the key is not to use too much
i ended up going cheaper
a little goes a long long way
thought it was just going to be an overly expensive version of all the other balms i have tried
my skin is more even.
my skin has never felt better
it does make my skin a little tight
it makes my skin actually softer
it dries out my skin too much
i like this algenist one because it works nicely with my clarisonic as well as on its own
it does make my skin a little tight
very affordable when you consider how much product you get
i like the algenist so much better
also set out to do alittle research
looks so much nicer
a little goes a long way
i can say that it has changed my face for the better
in fact i loved it so much i began using algenist moisturizers
my skin looks better than ever
adding a little bit of water as you go
also, a little goes a long way.
however i'm good with it.
a little goes a long way
it pretty much has immediate results
you only need a little bit
it goes a long way
so far it does not seem to be causing dryness
not in your face skin feels a little firmer
so far i'm liking this cleanser.
my skin looks better and better.
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way
i feels a little bit like i've used a clay mask.
it seems to work well with that condition
don't have to use much, - it goes a long way!
by far my favourite skin care product ever used.
a little goes a long way
my skin has never felt better
so far so good with this cleanser!
a little goes a long way
so for me it will be a 4 star morning cleaner.
i need something stronger
my skin has improved so much since i started using this
the only downside is that it could be bigger for the price
and my skin feels younger and looks it too!
that $75 cost hurts a bit
nothing i have tried has ever worked to lighten them one bit
don't feel like there is too much product on my face
how the pump doesn't pump out too much product
so many moisturizers that promise you the moon don't really do too much more than moisturize
my skin feeling slightly tighter
a little goes a long way
have never found one that works as well as this for my combo skin
in just 3 days my skin looks so much fresher
more even toned skin
this keeps my skin hydrated for longer than 24 hours to where i forget sometimes i need it
my skin is simply very much improved
while not quite as much line reduction as the lift
makes me cry a little
perhaps just as importantly
i only wish it was less pricey, hence the 4 *'s
i came in to buy clinique's even better spot remover
so far this lotion is a dream
just two little pumps
a much better fit for my oily combination skin
the price seems like a lot
i routinely have people tell me they think i'm 8-10 years younger than i am
almost like the tan lightening at a much faster rate than usual
so far so good.
looks better than before
skin tone looks more even
have a difficult time finding things
so far i have seen great improvement in my skin.
my acne seems to be healing faster as well.
a little goes a long way.
i feel like i could probably find something with the same result for less money
it is a little expensive
you don't need to use too much.
it overall just looks more even
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way
the algenist works better for me
is a lot more concentrated
it smells nice and fresh, but not too much.
usually my jar lasts about 9 months maybe longer
not too heavy not too light.
i normally would never spend this much on a cream
i find i like it better for night
i can see that it plumps my skin slightly.
would like a bigger jar at a better value.
i just got on to order some more
this is much more than a moisturizer!
a little goes a long way.
i believe that the best anti aging method is prevention just like with most things it's better to start early before the problem is already there
you only need a little and it goes a long way.
a little goes a long way so the $ works itself out
it is expensive, but a little goes a long way.
i would prefer a pump or squeeze bottle instead to preserve the ingredients better especially due to how expensive it is
'hope you like it as much i do
you only need to use a little
my skin looks so much healthier
feels so much better after applying this cream
a little does go a long way
it is not too heavy
though the price tag was more than i could afford
which i still like
i can say this one gives a little extra punch
$90 can seem like a lot, but it lasts a while.
here's the verdict so far
a little goes a long way so even if you use it day
it might turn out to be less expensive overall than plowing through cheaper product twice as fast
you don't need to use too much
i also notice that my skin seems a lot smoother now
so a little definitely goes a long way with this product
my skin has never looked better-- i find that with this cream
a little goes a long way.
my skin even seemed
i don't nead as much makeup
also, a little goes a long way.
a little goes a long way
however a little goes a long way
moisture is so much improved
i cant explain it other than that my skin looks so healthy
just dont put too much, a little goes a long way.
so don't go layering on too much
though i still prefer the texture
my pores looks so much better
a little bit definitely goes a long way
i went online to see how much it was
my skin has never looked better in my entire life
make up looks better
after just a week of use my skin is clearer
a little goes a long way also.
it's a lot more product than i was expecting.
some of the fine lines i had around my eyes seem softer
opt for something cheaper that works just as well
then a little less in the morning
the irritation was subsiding much faster than anything else i tried
over work or just are extra tired because i have to go to work
as i get older having fresh looking skin isn't as easy
a little goes such a long way!!
it's great so far
is surprisingly a better value
so far none of that, just soft clear skin.
a little goes a long way.
this one is almost to much for me
i think amorepacific does a better job
slightly more fragrance than i care for
it's also larger than most masks
as far as performance
because if the rest of the products work as well as this one
now it is more combination
sometimes need a little "oomph
it may seem pricey at first
because a little bit of the liquid-gel goes a longgg way
maybe slightly citrus-y?
i could see how it may be a tad too "perfume-y" for some people
at first thought it was a little expensive
it is softer than ever
i love how light it feels on the face -- almost like a moisturiser rather than a mask
i likes it so much that i changed my moisturizer
this has helped so much
it is much stronger than necessary for something you are supposed to sleep in
they are amazing an unfortunately on the pricier side
my make up seems to go on much smoother.
i could make it last a long time though as it seems a little of this stuff goes a long way
it is a little pricey for the bottle
a little goes a long way
i find i only need one pump of it as a little goes a very long way
a little goes a long way
with enough left for at least 2 more
is more like a gel
a little goes a long way
after 3 nights i've already seen results my skin has never looked more hydrated
origins drink up is good too
a little bit goes a long way
it is however a little sticky
and you get so much for the money!
a little of the product is all it takes
i find that most of the time this is enough
it evens out my skin tone better than expected.
so glad i got the bigger jar!
i am starting to have some small lines at my eyes too
it goes on so smooth
my skin looks noticeably better the next day
i've never used a cream more than a few times because they tend to clog my pores
like it actually improves the look of my skin with each day
a little goes a long way
i really appreciate that since it is a little on the pricey side
i wish this was a bit more brightening
i think it has even my skin tone a tad
so far i'm in love
i am not getting any younger
not changing anything about my routine for 2 days my skin is a lot happier
i love this so much.
my make up looks so much better on when i have used this the night before
i wish it weren't quite so expensive
so far it's great
it absorbs really well within about 15 minutes
to me this is a way better product
its a little heavy for me in the summer
after one use i could dramatically see how much better my skin was the next morning
needed something to make it less dull
a little bit goes a long
hence it lasting me so long
it usually takes me 7-10 days to get to the store to get more
a little bit really does go a long way
it works better when i use after a peel
or i put it too much
a little goes a long way
it made my skin better
(dime size or so) and you are good to go!
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way.
keep coming back to it after using even more expensive
you will wake up to more even
needs a little help in the winter
so far so good.
a little goes a long way
i love this night cream so much.
i liked it so much
a little goes a long way
also, a little goes a long way.
i tried switching to cheaper stuff
so a little goes a long way :
nothing different to my usual moisturiser.
it make take a little
a little goes a long way
you just need to wait a little bit after applying
this is a little light for me
lasts for a very long time
i find that it feels like i've put too much on
t's a little too intense for me to use on a daily basis
i honestly prefer this to the much more expensive
i like this product very much
the big bottle has that special pump that makes the use so much easier
the only thing i would like for the product to be improved on is to have a smaller pump area
i do find i wake with a little eye irritation some times
triple action does a much better job of taking off makeup in fewer applications
does the job well
mostly just for makeup
it works just as well as the other more pricier cleansing waters
requires not much product to remove a lot of make up
s for a little less money
feels great with norhing more than a clean feeling afterwards
one of the better waters out there.
wish it lasted longer though!
it seems like the bottle is going to last quite a long time
i usually get the large bottle because it has the pump making it easier to use
the bottle lasts a very long time
it takes off eye makeup so much easier
my skin has never looked better
so far love this product!!!
usually have a lot of problem
i no longer have to pay so much money for the ones i used
other than that the product is very good!
it is a lot better for that
it does leave a little bit of a residue
plus this is a way better deal than constantly buying wipes
it works just as well for a considerably lower price
not only does my face feel cleaner
find myself reaching for this more instead
maybe it is making a difference
best part is you only need a little bit to get the job done
this is what i think of the eye cream so far
the facial scrub because it makes my skin feel so much more hydrated than anything i have ever used in the past other origins products included in that
this product is much lighter than my skin tone
a little goes a long way
a little bit goes a long way -- i'll have this little jar for a while
it seems to do a little something
my only issues were that if you use a bit to much it can take longer for the product to absorb
a little goes a long way!
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way!
a little goes a long way.
quick tip: a little of this cream goes along way
which has surprisingly lasted me quite a while
it never feels heavy
how well it works
it takes such a small amount too that i can feel good about the price
a little bit goes a long way so this container will last you a good while
i always jump around to other eye creams just to see if one is better than another
as of now i haven't used this long enough to share any long term effects
a little goes a long way
a little bit goes a long way to making your eyes look more awake
a little goes a very long way!!
so far so good
a little goes a long way.
it feels light and not greasy as well.
which may be quite a while because a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way
it does make my under eyes look brighter
not much helps them
a little goes a long way with this eye cream.
this cream has really helped so much with that
little goes a long way
for some reason none of them have been good enough for me to remember to use them on a normal basis
a little goes a long way.
a little goes a long way
it actually makes them feel better too
this is one of the very few eye creams i would ever buy over
a little goes a long way so this will last awhile
'm still waiting for better results
on top of that a little goes a very long way so the amount you get in it is amazing
a little goes a long way
it does help a little
sleeping very little lately
a little goes a long way for sure
start with a little bit first
and definitely a little goes a looonng way.
a little goes a really long way
de-puffing the area making it look so much nicer
goes on so much smoother
i love this eye cream so much.
never imagined how much i would love this eye cream
so maybe over time it will depict better
if i am even slightly tired
a little goes a long way
my face tends to feel a little tight
i struggle a lot less with oil and breakouts.
then it leaves my skin a little stift
other than that it does a good job
loves it as much as i do
however it loses a start because its more like a cream
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way
a little goes a very long way
i've probably gone through five bottles so far
it takes so long to go through the bottles as well
a little goes a very long way
it'll make my face feel a little bit tight
still have plenty left
the price is nice too compared to some of the other high end cleansers
my skin looks better than ever
a little bit goes a long way
a little goes a long way
just to see if there might be something new out there that works even better
a little bit goes a long way!
a little goes a long way and foams up well.
my acne r pretty much all gone now.
affordable for the amount you're getting as a little goes a very long way
a little goes a long way
i also love how a little goes a very long way
huge perk is that a little bit goes a long way!
you only need a little bit.
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way
a little amount goes a long way!
a little goes a long way
lathers up a ton so a little can go a long way
i need to try more from origins.
this one is by far my favourite
a little goes a long way
even though it is more pricier than what you get at a drugstore
this face wash made it all better
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way.
my skin has never looked better
you barely have to use any product because a lot goes a long way
it goes a long way
my face has never felt better!
a little goes a long way
always only as a spot treatment as it is meant to be
which is more than what i can say for much of the other stuff i have tried out of curiosity
i wish that it was bigger
other than that i don't have any complaints it has work nicely for me
stings a little at first
it is still pretty much full
they are considerably smaller or gone the next day
so far so good
that this works way better as a night treatment
plus a little goes a long way.
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way
definitely better than drugstore alternatives
^ it also may be a little bottle
irritation is calmed really well so that it's easier to cover
just because they want to make my life more difficult
so this is going to last quite a long time
a little bit goes a long way
a little will go a long way
it does make my pimples heal up much faster than they would otherwise
i love that mask so much
just know, a little bit goes a long way.
at first use, it burned so much!
it even sits well under makeup.
i think it works better than most salicylic acid treatments out there
how long it lasts
i love it so much
it is a little pricey
this works better than anything i have used--it must be magic
nothing is better than origins super spot remover
also a little goes a long way!
i've tried so many things
this either makes them go away completely or considerably smaller the next day
it does burn a little but nothing uncomfortable.
but it stings quite a bit at first though.
makes them go away faster
the spot seems a lot less irritated
since a little goes a long way
i actually applied it all over my face just to see how much it worked
this has made not only more difference than anything i've tried in 15 years
definitely has changed my skin for the better!
it goes down considerably
a little goes a long way
this product certainly helped reduce the breakouts from getting worse
a little goes a long way
i tried this stuff for about a month or more now.
it's a little heavier than its
decollete the most as well as when i plan on putting bit more make up on my face
they no longer make it
when i apply it little by little to different sections of my face
it feels too heavy
would only fix so far
most importantly to me how little i have to use
my skin feels so much better after applying it
i very much like this product
not as much as the plantscription
love it so much i have purchased it to use every night
i noticed within the first few days my skin looked so much better
i noticed within the first few days my skin looked so much better
i noticed within the first few days my skin looked so much better
not too heavy in summer
it is a little expensive
heavier for use at this time of year
a little goes a long way.
summer for me too
it was a little pricey for me
im liking it so far
i like origins products very much.
a little goes a long way.....
my skin was beginning to look a little dull
so far, so good!
although i have to wonder if its too heavy for the summer time
a little goes a long way
although i still think i like korres better
a little goes a long way
find it is a bit heavy for day time use for me
my acne scars seems to be fading a bit faster than usual
a little goes a long way
you are getting way more than what you pay for!!
good cream but too heavy for me.
started using it i realized i was probably better off with the oil free version
it may be a bit too much especially if you are active
this is a little too heavy for me
the results from this very reasonably priced product are far better than those costing hundreds of dollars
i feel like my skin has improved in a short time using this product
at first you might think its a bit greasy
i feel like it keeps my skin cleaner for longer
not to mention the other signs of aging on my face so actually rather happy with the results
after using for 3 months i could feel my skin was stronger
a little goes a long way.
when all the hype around serums started i was skeptical as it seemed like another expensive step to add to my skin care routine
a little bit goes a long way
it can be too much for even my dry skin to put makeup on top
it just is so even
making you look younger
i loved it so much
a little bit goes a long way
it may feel slightly greasy on application
it takes so little
goes such a long way
with so much less product
to me 52 dollars is a lot to spend on what i feel like more of a 25-30 dollar product
a little goes a long way
have never found anything as good or better than it
so far so good
wish it was in a pump or squeeze tube bc i think a jar exposes it to too much air so the ingredients "expire" faster
a little goes such a long way
unfortunately it's a bit too expensive for me to repurchase just for this
i realized how much of a difference it made!
it goes a long way
rivaling the more expensive ones
pretty much year round
the smell was so strong it somewhat gave me a headache
love it just as much as i did the first time
it has really helped my face look less exhausted
i got this as a sample without much expectation as things like this you can seldom see any difference
it is like a little life saver for skin.
a little goes a long way.
i loved this product so much.
i love it just as much
had little to no expectations to use it
can't speak to how much brighter my complexion is
it couldn't have been better timing
more so than usual
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way.
get a little more moisture
nothing i've tried has gotten rid of that tight feeling under the skin like this
a little goes a long way
perhaps even over a year or so
just a tiny bit of this product goes a long way which is also great because im not wasting a bunch of the product for one night
another bonus is there's more product for less money than plantscriptions
it does not break my out its a thick consistency so a little goes a very long way
scars are looking better it's only for night time
i think my skin produces less oil during the day now because it is getting the hydration it needs at night
i found it works better for me as a day cream
what more do you need?
it has helped my skin sooo much
a little goes a long way
my acne spots are less dark than before
i don't have to use much
a little goes a long way, so the price evens out.
i break out less
it isn't too pricey and a little goes a long way!
a little goes a long way
it really draws any under-the-surface blemishes out so while it may make your skin a bit worse the next day
i rarely ever break out
a little goes a long way.
it doesn't take much product at all because it moisturizes so well
so far so good
t foams up very good therefore a little goes a long way
i like it very much.
it does have a tad bit of a stronger smell
a little goes a very long way
my only complaint is that it could be a tad bit more gentle
this is a much better match for my dry
i've used quite a bit from other br
my face has never been better
it never makes me break out more importantly
a little goes a long way
so far have not had any breakouts from this product
been using origins for quite awhile
balances next to see which i like better
if not #1 on my list so far
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way.
maybe the formula has changed a bit
a little bit goes a long way
wonder why it lasts less than a month
its because you have to use so much of it
a little goes a long way too
the best part is that you only need a very small amount to go a long way
so far i have noticed my skin looking more clear
i wished it lathered a little more.
but, never the less it cleans good.
it seems to deep clean using very little
my face just looks …for lack of a better word
also love that a little goes a long way.
this mask helped me so much.
it tingles a little bit when you put it on
a little goes a long way
i just leave the mask on longer
a little goes a long way
the price for this mask is much cheaper than the overrated higher-end masks
it really makes my skin newer
in the morning i have much better evenness to that area
(and a little of this stuff goes a long way)
the little time i did use it
thinking of getting bigger size to try it out long
when i use this in conjunctionsome other masls i noticed my breakouts go away faster
it definitely made my skin more smooth
my skin looks so much better
since that is more pricey this is nice
while my pores haven't looked that much smaller they are definitely clearer
it makes your skin feel much better
my face seemed to clear up a little bit after i used this
helps stop more from coming
when i don't have much time
a little goes a long way.
i prefer this mask over the glamglow ones as i found the gg masks extremely drying with price more than twice
do not use this everyday.it is way too harsh.
my makeup even looked better throughout the whole day
this is too long
i do find that it helps make my skin feel less bumpy
i love this product so much!
my skin was a lot smoother
not so bumpy like it use to be
my skin feels 100x better after
i love this so much i have bought it five times now
so far i'm loving this mask.
i spent so much money
tried countless products- with little to no results at all
you can layer it on as well depending on how much you want on your face
my skin looks so much better
i do find i still get a deeper purification from glamglow
it is also much much more affordable than glamglow
i am definitely going to be repurchasing the bigger bottle
my pores seem a lot smaller
my pores are sooo much smaller and cleared!!
it took me longer to rinse off than any other product
my pores look bigger than usual
it lasts so long for only 26$
a little goes a long way!!!
four stars coz there are same/better masks out there for a better price
i look much more awake
my makeup looks so much better with this under it
the cream helped a little
seriously though, the lines are gone.
with this a little goes a long way
i just wish it was a little more affordable
it only take very little product
as far as wrinkles
a little goes a long way
not as much under makeup
it just keeps getting better with time
a little goes a long way
i little bit goes a long way so even though the container is only
i've never had so much success with any other products
there are some little spots that are still try
my eyes look sooooo much better
it always burned a little
i've tried clinique even better eyes riche
i found a little bit of this that i forgot about
a little bit goes a really long way
it gets the job done though.
i started putting on eye makeup more often
a little goes a long way
i don't tend to stick with many products that long
i wished that there was more product
so far it has worked very well
have gone through so many different creams with no results
i kind of wish it was a little more emmolient
this eye cream is way more effective than clinque
anticipated a bit more of a miracle
it will sting a bit if too much gets in
so far so good!!
a little goes a long way
a little bit goes a long way
the little tub lasts that long
a little goes a long way
absolutely will repurchase- better than anything i've ever used before
i noticed that my concealer goes on much smoother ever since i started using this product
favourite eye cream i've tried so far.
to see even better results
it almost works too well because it leaves my non-oily sections a little tight
so far i love it!!
my black heads seemed just a little smaller
my makeup stays on longer
so far i like it
a little bit goes a long way!
a little goes a long way with this product
i do not use it more than once a day as i have combo skin
i think if i used it more it would make me too dry
for $26 i expected it to be a little bigger.
all you need is a little bit, too.
during the summer months my face is alot more slick
a little goes a long way.
i did need a little touch up
my face has less oil
you also need a little amount
just be aware that a little goes a long way.
that has happened to me on more than one occasion
my acne looked better too
it actually behaves now :
fast working is the first thing that comes to mind when i reach for this little number
even if your skin is breaking out a little more after first using
a little bit goes a long way!
that only shows me how little my other face washes worked
now that i've accustomed to it
i rather enjoy it
its less than normal
i've noticed with origins that a little goes along way
it was even better
a little goes a long way, too.
my pores look much better
much cleaner after using it
i've noticed they look much better than they used to before i started using this product
little goes a long way
it's even better than i was use to
feels a million times better
more importantly i have less oil on my face
it helped so much
its not too much for me
my face was a little tired
it smells so regressing and good.
even better is that it isn't drying at all!
it adds so much moisture
nice mask to use, not too expensive, will use up.
don't end up going too far
i usually leave it on for longer
i never leave any mask on for more than 10-15 minutes
i could already feel the difference of my skin getting softer
it is definitely a much better mask compared to fresh's rose mask in terms of its functionality
this was definitely the least expensive
i love it when the least expensive option turns out to be great :
i find it works way better this way than rinsing it off
night time is when your skin is most receptive to these kind of treatments anyway
it lasts for a good awhile too
it just gives your skin enough water to make it looks better
my makeup actually stays on better
the only problem is that it smells too good.
the result lasts much longer than most other products
it is slightly too intense for me to use as an all-over face mask
this mask is much better than the new boscia overnight moisture mask
t could work as a travel mask if you use a little bit
spread it all over you don't need much
my makeup even looks better once i've used this.
makes my skin feel 10 years younger in only 10 minutes
i also love to put a little on my h
i applied a little too much the first time
a little goes a long way
which can be drying so this makes a much needed change
even though i like both
i really prefer the more intensive overnight mask
how quick it goes on
i tried this product without much expectation since the price was pretty low
i can see my skin getting more water...
so the product made me break out a little
other than that i didn't notice that much of a difference in my skin other than it was a little bit softer
maybe it will work better in the winter.
i´m more than satisfied with this mask
even other people noticed how much smoother my skin looked after just one use
my face is so much better
a little does go a long way
a little goes a long way
makes my skin look noticeably better
must be the mask :d price is good too!
sometimes my skin is still a little tight
t's a bit much for me to pay
i would like it more if it had a pump package
a little goes a very long way.
i pretty much use it as a primer
wish i could get a bigger bottle
a little goes a long way
after the first day of use i could tell this was far better than any other lotion i've used for oily acne prone skin
this product could probably work for mild combination skin as well
a little goes a long way.
to much had me looking real slick in the face
i think this is a much better option for results
a little does go a long way
i like something on the lighter side
the "oiliness" of my face has gone down so much in just 2 weeks
i knew i needed something lighter for summer.
i just wished it was a little bigger for the price it currently has
since a little goes a long way
just wish they made a bigger bottle!
as far as oil control i do still get oily throughout the day
a little goes a long way.
a little goes a long way
my skin has been so much clearer
too much product is released with one little squeeze
i don't break out much
i love how it makes my skin feel although i do find that my skin gets a little bit more oilier when i wear it than when i wear nothing on skin
my skin is much less oily at the end of the day
my makeup tends to last much longer
maybe i'm expecting to much from this moisturizer?
my skin is much clearer
my skin adjusted though - for the better!
however i need a little more moisture
now of course a lot of my blemishes are still there
a little can go a long way
everybody can see my skin condition improves much much better
a little bit goes a long way
which is worse during the summer
i couldn't be happier
was still so smooth
i see more results from this than i do any other 'acne' mask
makes them hurt less
at the same time you only need a little bit at a time to do the job
honestly, a little goes a long way.
this mask is even better for my skin
every time i have a little breakout
i would give more than 5 stars if i could.
while i don't normally like spending this much on a bottle for my face
a little goes a long way
often leave it on for longer than 10 minutes
in a week my skin already looks a lot better
the next day my skin already looks much better
it works that well
it makes my skin look so much better
nothing much more to say than i love it.
this mask has helped me so much
it does make it less irritated
i feel like it works better overnight
i've found that this works better
i still have quite a bit left
it seems like it might be a little drying
most of my bumps are gone
this product save my skin every time i picked too much my skin
every time after using this my bumps would become fewer
or even just have a little problem appear r
it is definitely much improved
it helps to clear up my skin so much
i usually leave it on much longer than the recommended time
even though it has a kind of kitchen cleaner potent smell it feels like its really working
i especially love it if i notice my skin is looking a little bumpy before applying makeup
even adds a little moisture
i don't usually have more than one or two small spots at a time
i've read that a lot of other people wear it for longer
i put this mask on for way longer than recommended
it just makes it way more invigorating
hopefully see even more results
s still much better than where we stared off
i just need to give it a little more time
rather than a full mask
breakouts have defintely gotten worse
i do leave it on for more than 10 min.
i wouldn't use it more than once a week, though.
i even think i might like this one a little more than the clear-improvements one
if there is a black residue it means you have used too much- you only need 4 little dabs around your face because a little goes a long way
some say more moisturizer is needed
you are probably better off looking elsewhere
my face has never been softer or happier!
it deserves more than 5 stars
spills out too much product
it takes up more space than most of my other products
just made my skin worse
a little goes a long way
i say use it more for night
a little goes a long way
actually do see a difference in my skin as far as healthy glow
i hate how much i love this moisturizer because it is so darn expensive
has a more even tone
it goes on well
i may need heavier for winter
when i can no longer pump out product
i would love it even more if there was more product for the price i pay
i can apply my makeup on rather quickly which makes me happy
i'd rather it not have the dome
i love this so much
i think it should have bigger
i've gotten so many compliments
it does what it says it does -- my skin has a noticeably
it even gives it a bit of cooling effect
a little goes a long way.
it still seems a little odd
my makeup lasts so much longer
it takes me a lot more time to look shiny
i just could not be happier
a little goes a long way!
it is difficult to deconstruct the package once it no longer pumps up
there isn't much left
you only need a little bit for your whole face
i just wish it was a little more inexpensive.
maybe too lightweight for the winter
wish it had a better smell
love this moisturizer so much.
not feel like its too much
t's just a bit of a hassle to keep repurchasing it so frequently
so much i will continue using there br
so far i really like the product.
first you have to push down slowly so your not getting too much product
s a little goes a long way with all products
my skin also looked better overall.
a little goes a long way
it doesn't allow for very much control on how much product comes out
the bottle almost forces you to use too much.
i just wish it was cheaper.
so far i like it
a little goes a long way!
easy to control how much product you get out
so not much gets used
well, this little jar proved to be a gem.
i love the little push pump
use a little or as much of the product as you want
cannot tell how much i have left because it still feels heavy
i also suspect the packaging makes it look like there's more product than their actually is
my fine lines got better too
good product but could be a bit thicker.
this formula is so much better
it does lighten the area slightly which is just the bonus because: my under eye area has never looked so smooth
as a little goes a long way with this little tub
when i do stray to a different product they get worse
it won't make me look 10 years younger
my other much more expensive creams won't too
everything seems smoother too
definitely better than the mega mushroom one
a little of this stuff goes a long way
you only need a little bit
a little goes a long way.
a little bit of this goes a long way
this product so far has worked for me
i think i need something stronger
i just think i need something stronger
well, at least it's not showing as much.
i don't have much
this is so light.
a little goes a long way.
no more little fine lines or wrinkles
i only need a little under each eye.
you only need a little bit
recently started to notice that it was harder to put on eye shadow
even though it was more expensive it wasn't better
so far i really like this eye cream.
i feel like i am getting better results than the other products more than twice the cost of this one
why buy something cheaper that doesn't work?
i'd rather spend a little more for something that delivers
have noticed more fine lines just under my eyes lately
my eyes are looking more like 41 than 61!!
have found cheaper, just as good alternatives.
i couldn't be happier
i found this eye treatment light yet just as effective as a richer cream
my eyes do look brighter, and a little softer.
this is a good value as it will likely last a year with as little as is needed
looking worse than before i put them on
very little needs to be used
it is a little pricier than your average eye cream
i got this because i have seen so many ads about it
i don't have much to improve
too many products are for "under the eye" or crow's feet
i really like this product so far.
they are amazing--not too much fragrance
i cut the pads in half so they last longer.
however haven't used long enough
there is little to no scent.
so much so that even with using these at night
my skin has become more even toned
the long term results are even more impressive
that says a lot only because i have tried all of the very expensive creams to try
this makes my skin more tight
swear that my fine lines around my eyes are looking a little softer
kind of pricey for how fast you go through it
my only issue with this product is that it seems to go so fast
my skin completely changed for the better.
the texture got better
the clinique serum has been pretty much the only thing to finally stop those breakouts in their tracks
i honestly have a more even complexion
they just keep getting better
so far this product is great
the tone is noticably more even
this works better than anything i've tried in the last 10 years
my skin just looks younger
smoother it feels now
7 oz from nordstrom because it's a slightly better deal
my skin doesn't feel better or worse for having applied it
a little goes a long way
i didn't realize how much this product i proved my skin tone until i ran out for several weeks
a few days ago i noticed my skin just simply looked generally better in the morning
i started using much less
most days need no foundation:
plus i breakout much less now on the clinique
no such night cream has ever been so good to my face like this one
my skin instantly looked brighter and more even.
even better dark spot corrector
my face reacts better to this than it did to the newer products clinique has put out since the beginning of the year
my tone was much more even
turnaround does all it says and more.
it even seems to give an added moisture boost too
it is softer, smoother, and more even toned.
so far i like it
the price was quite a bit lower than the product i've been using
a little goes a long way
i wish there was a bigger bottle!
a little goes a long way
i don't know why they raised the price to so much more than their other serums
the only downfall is that it runs out pretty quickly
i wish they made them in bigger bottles.
i like this product more that i expected.
it gives even better results
it helps keep my skintone more even
even though my skin is normal
my only wish is that it came in a bigger size because it seems to run out so quickly
i honestly have a more even complexion
then my even better clinique foundation
it is a little greasy
no matter how much you use
this has never broken me out when i had much more oily skin
i currently have much drier skin now
a little does go along way.
it is a bit pricy but works wonders for me.
would definitely be purchasing more
this doesn't have a fragrance or harsh oils it works better than any other i have tried
i love this better then the gel one.
i put it on at night as it's a bit heavier
since it's a little heavier than the original
it needs a little more time to absorb
i love the way that i can feel that it is more than just a lotion
so far i'm loving it
i rather be with clear
i love that its not too heavy
my skin has never felt better .
adds so much moisture
first time i tried it i definitely used too much.
moisturizes my skin so much better than any cream
still not cheap to waste the last bit
a little goes a looooooong way
my makeup looks a thousand times better.
can even be too hydrating if you use too much
my face definitely was more moisturized than it has ever been
i apply a little more at night
perhaps they're applying too much
my skin is so much better
a lot goes a long way
i needed something not to heavy
i stopped using it probably because i was poorer at the time
you can put as much on as you need
it works just as well
a little bit goes a long way
i feel like a little goes a long way
it's still not too much for my skin.
see which one i like more
it helped so much!
my skin is already feeling better.
this is too expensive to have any waste.
i needed more moisture than usual.
a driver too making all my other skin care work deeper
it is pricey but it lasts a long time!
even toned in less than 2 weeks
my skin looks better
every little bit helps when you are 70
lighter than they were in the fall/winter season
my skin looked good but it don't do too much.
would probably be better for more mature dehydrated skin
actually not so much on the wrinkles
sometimes more than the crew
love this product more than all of the others
only reason it doesn't get a 5 is that i've noticed my skin is a little more oily since i've been using it
it lasts quite a long time since you need very little at a time
makeup went on easier
truly hope the future benefts are more long-lasting than just immediate
usually we try to see a difference even when there isn't much of one
you only use the littlest bit so even the little sample lasted a week
i've always had more of a fold in one eye
shoots out so much product that you waste more than you use
wasting so much product
expensive but a little goes a long way.
it hasn't worked much for my under eye circles
as far as instant results it does what it claims for me
it has made my eyelids look much younger in only a month
so maybe because i'm being more religious about taking care of my eyelids
it lasts a very long time because you need so little
your eye makeup stays on better than ever
my eyelids feel tighter and are much less droopy.
the folding has minimally changed, but not much.
it doesn't get any easier!
so far i love it.
looks like it so,far.
a must for women who have more mature skin.
well worth the splurge as my eyes look as good as the rest of my skin
you really need such a small amount too.
it not only makes them look much better after i apply it
i easily spent this much trying to find something that works
the pump shoots out quite a bit
if i have to buy too much of it
i may as well go get a blephoraplasty or whatever that eyelid lift surgery is called because this is too expensive to work only this much
a little goes a long way...
never have as much movement in my upper lid as i am having now
never realized how much i missed it
a little goes a long way!
missing 1 or 2 nights ok, but any more shows.
other eye makeup go on much easier
i think it can do better or it would be better at $70-80 range
a little goes a long way
i rarely purchase something more than once
my fine lines are better as well.
it is hard to tell how much is left
it's cheaper than an eye lift
they think is better
my eyelids are not seeing too much aging yet
sometimes i even pat a little extra after i finish my makeup to moisturize a little extra
just remember to use a tiny bit otherwise you will run out faster than you need to
day 1 the difference was pretty much immediate
my skin seems tighter
saying my skin was looking even better than usual
i couldn't be happier
maybe made dark circles a bit less intense
the beginnings of those little lines that a normal 26 year old like myself will notice
the deeper ones look softer
not much for firming
it's easier for me
so maybe with a little more patience
too much money to have to use two products
i sometimes hesitate to spend this much on a product
my lids much to my chagrin are getting 'crepey'
i could not be happier.
so don't worry that it is expensive
the best thing i have seen is my eyelids have become a lot smoother
the crease has become more smoother which is why it looks like their is more distance between my brow
love it, get it and see through better eyes!
a little of this product goes a long way
i could even see just using this on more oily days
i wish it were slightly more hydrating
better after using this
love it- a little does go a long way
couldn't be happier with it
nothing has seemed to work
chin while not making too much extra oil in the t-zone
it doesn't make too much oil
i hope she makes more
even in the little corners on the top of my nose where no moisturizer ever wants to go
only a little dab is needed for the whole face
my skin is cleaner, clearer, and more even.
which my skin seems to respond to much better than salicylic
you only need a little bit
making my skin much less oily throughout the day
my pores have gotten smaller in just about a week
a little goes a long way so don't over pump!
gets every little bit of makeup off.
my face looks much better
pores definitely look better :d my only complaint is that they don't sell it in a bigger bottle since i typically use it twice a day
said that it solved pretty much every problem my skin could possibly have
it warms up slightly as you use it
just wish it lathered up a bit more.
i wish the bottle was bigger
my skin has never looked better!
since i satrted using it i have seen my skin getting better over time
even my makeup looks better
so far i'm loving it
haven't had any breakouts so far
a little goes a long way.
i suppose it helped make it a little more bubbly
my face is also so much softer and brighter.
a little goes a long way
definitely better than most i have tried
the product doesn't go very far
this one cleans really well without being too harsh
my skin much smoother
this product did more than expected.
ever since i started using this my skin is much less oily
better than other face oil i have tried
too soon to talk about wrinkle reduction
other products seem to push it deeper into the pores
i will most likely get the cream serum from them as it costs a little less
they can heal deeper acne better
a little pricy but doesn't take much.
a little goes a long way
like others, i too saw fairly immediate results.
makes the area look better within minutes
a little goes a long way
i actually had my little
only a little bit is needed
thought i would just go with something cheaper
i could see at that time how much better my skin looked when i was using this product as opposed to another br
my skin looks better now than it did 5
still have a bit more left
getting more notice-able wrinkles such as crow's feet that were starting to just really bother me more
as well as those "smile lines
those lines/wrinkles are what i really most want improvements in as well as all over "toning
in three days i could see that my skin was much firmer
made the large pores disappear completely making make up look so much better
it does not irritate me the least bit which says a lot because my eyes are beyond sensitive
wanted something that would firm a bit more
so far i'm loving this cream.
great buy plus no more pimples either.
i may need something heavier in the harsh winter months
i'll repurchase until the winter when i think i'll need something heavier
it does go a long way
looks so much better since starting to use this
pretty much everything becomes heavy
the algenist is a little cheaper.
it goes on so smooth
keeps it looking fresher longer
i do notice my skin feeling tighter
wish it was cheaper though1
my skin looks better with this than anything else i've tried
it's as if my skin just feels sturdier
quality cream that goes a long way
i've tried so many things for my face.
it makes my skin feel better using versus days that i don't
a little goes a long way!
the big downside: it is way too expensive.
it only got better
ironically from smiling too much
being 20 years old in school i find this very expensive for what it does for me
so far i like it
so don't need a lot of firming
i tend to believe in expensive products just because i have had better experiences with them
i usually would not spend this much money on a moisturizer
my skin looks much smoother as a result of this product
feel like my face became somehow smaller
my make-up goes on so much smoother
just wish it was less expensive.
my skin looks better than ever: dark spots are lighter
spent so much money
my skin seems clearer and more even as well.
a bit pricey but it takes very little.
too expensive, but i love it anyway.
i only use a little
it gets pretty drastic.
my left eye looks 100% better.
i am blown away that it could actually affect my skin so much
lifting eye gel is so far the only one works for me
it works even better
dark circles still seem there.
thought it was time to see if something less expensive would work just as well
might even doing better at that than the cru was
it helped my dark under eye arrea look much better
a little goes along way.
just a speck of this is leaving my whole eye area significantly better
still hope more result.
my under eye bags are no more
two pumps is wasting too much product
so far i like the product quite a bit.
tried so many eye treatments
a little goes a long way.
the pump dispenses just a little as opposed to the korres that dispenced too much
i like it so far
i found that i needed a little more moisture
it might not help much to alleviate serious dark circles
so far i am liking this
it just made the area under my eyes look so much better than others i've tried
it is light and a little goes a long way.
i can see even more results on him.
it goes on slightly slick
it seems to work a little.
it can only get better with time.
loving it thus far.
it's expensive so might try something cheaper next time
deeper line going fast
has easy application so a little goes a long way
i feel it makes me look more bright-eyed than if i skip it
though it isn't a long-lasting effect
i just put a bit more on
the skin around the eyes look so much better just after one week :
if i use too much in the morning my face can appear borderline greasy throughout the day
it takes makeup easier than any wipe i've ever used
i would not recommend it as an eye cream to younger people as it is too drying
it goes on so easily
i think this would have been great if my skin was a little less dry
a pump would be better.
it lasts a little over a season for me
more bouncy if that makes sense?
a little goes a long way
it helps me through the day to keep my face so much less oily than it usually is
i've actually been breaking out much less since i started using it
smooth i couldn't be happier
i tried this product becuase well i'm getting older
my skin is getting thirstier even in the summer
i love this product so much .
a little goes a long way
a little bit goes a long way
my skin always requires a much heaver night time moisturizer
i would recommend for those of us who ooze a little more during the summer months
my skin is more even looking
this goes on so smooth
a little bit goes a longgg way
she gave me so much advice
& a little goes a long way!
it made me breakout a little
i wanted something a little richer for the winter
"a little goes a long way" definitely holds true
a little goes a long way
it's definitely more under control than before
it is much less than i noticed before using this product
a little goes a long way
still not as long as i would like for an expensive moisturizer
i would have given 5 stars if it lasted longer.
works better than any other moisturizer i've tried
it smells great but isn't too much.
for all those complaining about it making you more oily it did do that to me a little
just a little is needed
using different products has been challenging in the past because if my skin doesn't like it- i breakout bad
it's expensive but a little goes a long way.
it hasn't made the acne worse or better
the price is steep but a little goes a long way!
my skin looks better and feels better too.
it is pricy but it does last a long time.
it would be a little heavy for day use
wow how much better my skin is since using this moisturizer
i also use the one without spf at night as it is heavier
it is too heavy for day
a little bit goes a long way.
i put this on at night because it is a little greasy
takes too long to sink in for their liking
as others have said, a little goes a long way.
my acne is all but gone as well.
my skin has never been better which makes my makeup look flawless of course
or people who want a thicker
a little goes a long way.
have never been happier with my skin
have tried many things
it also goes on looking greasy for a bit while it sinks in so maybe wouldn't be good for combination skin
make your skin more even
i get so many compliments on how my skin has been looking
and a little bit goes a long way.
in general my face tends to lean more pink than the rest of my body
even a little firmer now
this would have gotten 5 stars if it weren't for the heavy
it does have a really strong rose smell that does not fade quickly
my skin is more even toned
the texture is so much smoother
which i have a lot of
i would not use it every day because it may be a bit much at that point
i notice that my skin seems more smooth when i use this regularly
this one is a bit more 'mature' in my opinion so that is my only complaint
texture has gotten better
over-all just so much better
i wish it was a little less harsh i want to love this more
it also make my skin look brighter
a bit too much for me....
my skin has never looked better!
i find it fades rather quickly though.
concentrated formula so a little goes a long way
it can also be a little thick
definitely looks a little healthier
this has helped fade them so much
this is way better
its better then my philosophy mirical night moister
of this hasn't been too heavy
maybe, a little heavy for summer.
i love this product so much!
this stuff is admittedly expensive though
my skin tone was more even
i wish i would've gotten a bigger jar!
actually makes it more difficult to use :/
when applying this product it feels slightly greasy
it seems a little pricey
s you get so much more product for about the same or even less of a price
which i like because the texture is a little heavier
you don't need too much
this may be a little much
though it is a little pricey
i just cannot see myself spending so much on something that goes down the drain
i love this cleanser so much!!
a little goes a long way.
looked better in general after using this balm
my face is much happier now :
it is a little bit more greasy than evelom
it balanced my skin out like nothing before
a little goes a long way
i couldn't be happier with this product!
this actually made my skin feel softer after being washed than before
why this is it for so many people
for some reason my skin finds them too heavy or something
which takes more time making this less efficient
i would spend so much time
sometimes you have to work harder on the eyes
clinique is much less costly.
quite a bit cheaper for the same amount of product
you have to use such a little amount
meaning it looks like
i prefer eve lom more
it takes longer than your traditional cleansers too
you need only a little
a little goes a long way.
even though i'm definitely on the oilier side
i also don't need as much moisturizer afterwards.
perhaps if you are more sensitive to smell it would bother you?
a little bit goes a long way
this balm is a smidge harder to remove compared to others
i feel it left more residue than most balms i have tried
or worse burn it
you get so much product for the price
a little goes a long way
it does seem to need a little extra work
that tends to be when i use too much water in the final stage
really not more then a pea size otherwise it is to much
i can use it with my clarsonic too!
everything made my skin worse.
my eyelashes seem longer since i've been using it
even though it is on the pricey side
a little goes a long way
i like it better than any foam cleanser i've ever used
my skin has improved so much!
i like how it makes my face more filled out
you do see a more plumped
it just seems to make my skin look smoother
makes it look better
makes my make-up last longer
loved it so much
it is a great product that lasts longer than i expected
my pores even seem smaller
this made the color more even
i find i need less than the amount suggested by the instructions--if i apply that much there is just a lot of extra product to wipe around
no longer have problems
so much so that i went back to sephora
my skin looks tighter
i would give it more starts
however $95 is a lot of money to pay so easy on it
so far so good
i do notice it appears finer
my skin looks so much better
it looks so much better
has given me so much
has some not so good side effects
as far as skin texture
my skin has never looked healthier or clearer
i just wish it had a stronger form of retinol for the price-
so my concerns are more fine lines than deep wrinkles
comes out since they are a little pricey
that said a little goes a long way
probably because they are so low
so far it works great.
a little goes a long way
during the winter i need something heavier
it has made my makeup go on better
once i started using this cream my skin looks much smoother
found that i needed a more intense product
seems to go much faster than the others i've used
it's disappearing much more quickly
my skin looks a lot brighter and softer.
a little product goes a long way
i no longer smell the product
feels softer than usual
my skin is so much brighter after using it that i will continue using both
a little goes a long way so for me it lasts a long time
a little goes a long way with this product
will occasionally go to a lighter one for those days
a little of this cream goes a long way.
my skin has never looked better
a little goes a very long way.
if your face looks oily you probably added too much
so far i do really like it
so far this has helped
also, a little goes a long way too.
i wish it absorbed into the skin a lot quicker.
i think in this price point this is one of the better ones
i no longer have to describe my skin as 'dry.'
i don't like the scent much but it works well.
it's a lot more lightweight than it initially feels
i definitely use it less in the summer
a little really does go a long way
how it looks though
this seems to work well
my skin is better now after using this creme
i don't see much in the area of brightening
my skin looks better than it ever has.
the scent is a little difficult to get used to
my skin has never looked better.
my skin no longer feels tight
probably about time, too.
since i feel like i need something a little more hydrating than my usual moisturizer
i think this texture makes me probably use more than i need
this has helped so much
a little goes a long way
i like a richer moisturizer for these places
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way
my skin tone is more even
if you put on too much feels like stinging
just wish these came in much bigger bottles as well as being available at their stores
my only complaint is that i wish it came in a bigger bottle
plus you only need a dab so the product lasts quite long
a little goes a long way
the bottle should last a very long time since you only need a tiny bit
to use it more often
i think more than a magical cure for stress
small bottle but a little goes a long way.
this product is good for that, too.
very potent, so 1-2 drops is more than enough.
fresh is much easier to find
at the end of the day my skin looks better than it would if i had not used this product
i can say my skin is pretty much normal with the exception that it gets a little dry during the winter
one pump is enough to cover the whole face as too much on at once
your face can look a little shiny from too much product
my skin has never been so smooth or consistently well-behaved
my face looks brighter and better.
so your makeup stays on longer
it seems like this product works even better
the more i use it i think it will just get better
not too heavy not too light just perfect!
so far, i love it!
a little goes a long way
i think they are charging a bit too much premium
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way
a little goes a very long way so the high price is not as bad as you would think
my skin does feel a little bit plumper
as far as it's lightening claims
it is just too expensive and nothing spectacular.
so that i get more moisture
that one is much thicker
i love this so much
longer-lasting than i thought
this is much more convenient to use at work
you may need something more potent
long night or just plain tired
other than that a great formula though.
i usually have none
looks twn times better
it is more cooling than any cream i've tried.
i also notice that i look less tired.
for the puffiness there is not any what so ever at all he has tried many eye creams
the dark circle under my eye has gotten much lighter
t would be easier to get on under the eyes
feel so much better
sadly i wish it was bigger!
better for more mature skin
cute little bottle and a little goes a long way.
definitely better than a dozen other products.
since i travel quite a bit for work
so much so that my husb
not as much as i'd hoped
hopefully as i use it more often
refreshing this is a must-have product for anyone who finds that they have puffy eyes in the morning so much product inside
it made it harder for me to apply to just under my eyes
for over $20 i'd expect more product
it can last a long time depending on how much you use it
works well for tired
love it so far!
so far i like it better than other depuffing eye gels
now they look sio much better
so as far as making you feel more awake
not so much an added scent
i wish it felt cooling for a little longer
a little less dark circle
i like this so much, i'm traveling with it now.
they also seem to be whiter when i use this product
i wish there was more.
actually drawing more attention to my eyes probably
people always think i look almost 10 years younger than my age
pretty much each time i get breakouts
in one night my skin looked 80% better!
made my skin so much better right away
tried something a little less expensive by caudalie
a little goes a long way
nothing works better than this <3
a little goes a long way
enjoy the fact that it has been leaving my skin brighter
t was too much with makeup on top of it for the day
s like cerave because they are so much cheaper
i realized that my skin used to be dull as well
i used it without expecting much
so far i have only used serums
i find a little goes a long way so this product will last me a while
i like it better then the illuminating moisturizer
it provides moisture without giving it too much.
i agree with some of the critics so far
my eyes have no more lines
i fall in love more and more with this line!
it does work well
so far i really like this one
they could certainly charge more
so far i love this moisturizer
my favourite face cream so far!
pretty rich but not too much.
spending the money hurts a bit
it just looked better in the way that a baby's skin looks better than everyone else's
i will say i got a little addicted
so maybe it's not the best choice for mature skin
a little goes a long way
it works do well
a little goes a long way
a little goes s long way.
get this little wonder mask
you could buy a lot more products for the money
for me that means healing time is shorter.
which is a little similar to this one
is easier to take off
is not as "tingling" this one is much more bearable while its on
you also don't need a lot of product it goes a long way
well maybe not the price
a little goes a long way.
it lasts for a very long time
also comes with a little spoon so you don't use too much
a little goes a very long way!
i love it too much
i need a cream with a bit more gusto
not sure it helped with wrinkles much
the full size jar will last more than a few months because it is so rich a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way.
my pores have definitely gotten smaller
a little does go a long way.
if it wasn't so expensive i would use it as a body wash as well
has lasted me 6 weeks with more to go so although the full size is pricey i think it would last up to a year which makes it well worth it
80 dollars is way too much for this.
only use very little
it's more than enough
a little goes a long way
even better is a great line
t's not too much of a problem
this is a part of their even better line
the spf 20 is a little lower than what i usually use
my skin is a lot softer, and better looking.
it's worked out well for me so far!
a little seems to go a long way.
i no longer have this issue since i've been using the even better skin tone correcting lotion
my pores look alot smaller
now in liquid form its so much better
so far this is pretty good
i am loving this product so far.
plus a little goes a long way.
so even though the bottle is expensive
it might be too much moisture.
bit in my opinion it smells better than good genes
even better over prescription
my skin looks sooooo much better.
all you need is two little drops
it was so dull
but this little wonder has completely changed it!
after winter in canada i needed something stronger than my usual
my skin has never looked better
i don't seem to have much of a problem using it very sparingly
i need very little to make an impact
my skin looks a little brighter
probably, because it lasts for so long.
today i had so much confidence
i really like it so far
t will take a tad longer
i like this product very much!
a little big goes a long way!
i still get acne too
i would've never imagined myself paying this much for a bottle of oil
my skin overall looks so much better
a little really goes a long way.
a little goes a long way
much happier than my wallet
i much prefer juno
it seems much thicker than the luna which i was a little concerned about at first because it's meant to be used in the am before foundation
so far so good
my skin looks younger and more rejuvenated.
the price is a little high
to me it means the ingredients are working deeper in my skin
i literally wanted to cry because it was expensive
this product is better
love it so much
while it may seem pricey for what you get a little goes a long way
it is a little thicker
as far as price goes, it is a splurge product.
its been working a lot better
took away a star because it's just way too expensive even if it works amazingly
i do find it a bit heavy for the summer days
i did so much research before splurging on this product
this has definitely become my staple.
lately i'be been feeling like i need a little more moisture
this oil is much thicker than luna
it is my favourite so far
the first is that it feels a bit heavy on the skin
so far this one takes the cake
a little goes a long long way
because after a while i think my skin gets a little too used to what i am using
1 pump is more than enough for my face
as far as the price is concerned
my self confidence is much higher now so this product is worth every single penny to me especially for my nose
it might sound a little off-putting
so far nothing else compares
i do avoid using this when i'm breaking out though because i find it makes my breakouts worse
a little bit goes a long way!
my pores look much smaller
i just wish it was less expensive
nothing work as well as this one
i don't think it lasts too long
i maybe i apply a little too much each time?
more than you normally get
it does sting a little for me
my fine lines are fading more every day
it's done so much for the texture
it just keeps getting better
it evens out my skin without being too harsh
now he has better skin than me thanks to this stuff
helps fade my dark spots faster than any other product i have tried
it had done so much for my skin since i started.
my skin just looks so much better
i am 54 and my skin has never looked better.
my skin is looking significantly better since i started using this line of products
i love this product so much.
a little bit does go a long way
a little goes a long way
the price is a little high
always wake up with my skin looking better than it did the night before when i put this one
i've seen a difference in my skin rather quickly
no more crazy break outs
i think you need something stronger for that
this product improved my skin more than anything i have ever used
overall much more airbrushed
more even my skin has become
as well as much smaller pores
i don't find it too intense
that's made things even better
within a week they're much better
got mine during vib sale, and i love it so much.
my skin has never looked better.
it looks like i barely used any
a little goes a long way.
dont' have much aging on my face
after a year my skin keeps getting better
my skin is actually clear now
it may dry your skin more than other products for the same reason it works better than other products- it's stronger
maybe try a different oil
so that might help some other people as well
it gets worse with stress
you get super results -- money well spent!
your makeup looks better the next day
but my skin has never been better.
you can get similar results for much cheaper
one pump is more than enough for the face
i just hate how expensive it is.
i love this product so much.
it lasts for a long time too .
it looks better in the morning
my skin is softer and more glowy than ever.
so much of the congestion is gone
i must say my face never looked better
i rarely get those now
no more texture issues, either.
i still have plenty
my skin has improved so much in tone
it was too good to not take advantage of.
it also lasts long, a little goes a long way.
the texture is also better than any cleanser i e tried because your face feels clean when done
my skin has seriously never looked better
there are far worse smelling things out there
now it looks clearer
since it is more high end
like many before me
i am no longer breaking out!!
i love this so much.
the price is a little steeper than i would like
i don't much care for it
my acne seems to be better
it makes my skin clearer as well.
've been having a ton of issues with my skin lately
my skin has been a lot more balanced
way better than it was
my skin has never been better willbe buying the full size for sure even tho it's expensive i've never had such a good cleanser
this i have found is not too harsh
it's made my pores look so much smaller
maybe a tad tight too
my acne isn't getting worse although i don't think this is particularly making it better
plus, my acne has calmed down quite a bit!
pores seem to have gotten smaller
a little goes a long way
this seems to work well with it
my pores seem a tad bit smaller after using
i wouldn't use it more than that
so that may be why i can't use it consistently without eventually developing a little redness
my skin just looks more refined overall
a little goes a long way
since i'm nearing 30 i also want something that's not quite as harsh as the proactive i used through my teenage years
my skin feels much better
now with this my makeup lasts longer than my other cleansers
because i love it that much
its more of a liquid where i thought it would be more thick
the bottle is a little bit pricey
products go on nicely after cleasing with this too
little my little bumps are gone
keeps me from breaking out as much as i normally do
it just kept getting better
after three days of using this i couldn't believe how much my skin had improved
it is pricier than most as it's a smaller bottle
it lasts a really long time
my skin has never looked better!
everything i was using was either not helping or making things much worse
a little goes a long way.
my pores are so much clearer
$60 may seem like a lot for a cleaner
you need so little
making my skin much softer
so far, so good.
my skin is much smoother
this has helped so much
i don't feel like it has actually made my pores smaller
my skin tone is more even
people of color often face even more challenging things with their skin
it's never too much
it has honestly changed my skin for the better
this has made my skin so much more clear.
hadn't been really cleaned with a good cleanser in a little while
my skin has never looked better
there is so many benefits
i will continue to buy this although clinique has a habit of changing a good cream a bit too often
it does work well every time
does my face feel more firmer?
a little bit of finishing powder
which is great because it will last longer.
the texture is heavier than the old zerogravity which i loved
the reviewers are correct- a little goes a long way
although it can be a little intense
a little goes a long way.
my face has never looked better
it is actually a little bottle of magic!!
it goes on a little greasy
this has a lot of the same benefits however i would say it isn't as strong as the others i've tried
it will work for you too
is not too harsh on my skin
i can honestly say that this product has made more of a difference to my troubled skin than any other product that i've tried so far
you use so little that it will last a long time
but, my skin is clear, more even-toned, softer.
i do wonder if it might be too heavy in the summers
so far this is a st
feels so much smoother
some reviews have complained that 5 drops is too much
i've spent way too much time in the sun
as i get older find they are too drying
i couldn't be happier with this product
everything just seems tighter
have been getting more compliments on my skin
i love it so much
it was expensive but it is lasting forever.
have hardly put a dent in the amount even though i use more than the directions call for
i love this product so much
there twice the price with not much results
the skin around my eyes looks better
this product has helped so much!
-- like a primer that makes you look 5 years younger
the very fine lines are minimized quite a bit while deeper ones are softened
seems to have better results
my skin looks better than it did in my 20s
since the area around our eyes ages 36% faster than anywhere else
try more of the product
it really only takes less than 2 weeks to see results
you only use a small amount so my first container lasted for quite awhile
nothing i've tried seemed to have much long term impact
this line because it was cheaper
makes them look way worse
also made it look better over time
i finally found something other than those wax type
well this is it
using too much or reapplying
so far so good
this has clearly been the best product i have used so far
my skin has never looked better
that only gets worse during that time of the month
seems to clear up way faster
much more vibrant since i've been using this moisturizer
after getting it under control by using stronger
goes on slightly matte which is great under makeup
a lot goes a long way
it is much less expensive
a little goes a long way.
using more than once a day did result in some dryness
as far as i know
i no longer get those painful
though it is a little pricey
i also think this is more of a treatment than a moisturizer
others have mentioned the hole from which the product comes out of to be too big
i still have quite a bit left
that's with being much more diligent
even seems to have reduced my pore size a little
it seems to be less shiny as well
it's expensive for how much you get
loved it before, love it even more now.
if you're squeezing the tube even slightly it spits out way too much product
you can go through it much faster than you need to
lately i haven't have been having any whiteheads what so ever
a little goes a very long way!
that was too much
now that it's winter i find i do need a bit more than this product alone provides
get way more product than i need because the opening to the tube is so big
the opening on the tube is too large so a lot of product wants to come out
the opening is way too big
it actually is frustrating to see so much product get wasted
it really seemed to do a much better job than the others i sampled
it seems to be a great combination so far!
this has made my skin better than it's been in 6 years
the last thing you want is more irritation
t's better to use it in the evening
the open to the tube is too big though- too much product comes out at one time
t is probably stronger than the other salicylic acid product i was using
i like it very much less time spent getting ready in the morning
as far as i can tell it dose the same great job
this one is more powerful than my usual
it does work well
you need very little of this
i still use a spot treatment for bigger zits
my skin got a lot better
it makes it easier to cover with makeup though
because i love it so much
i only wish that it contained more product because its a little pricey
i rarely ever break out
it lasts for such a long time as well
this dries my skin out a lot less than other ones
i apply it sparingly because a little seems to go a long way
its hard to get out just a tiny bit
you can really feel it working with the stinging sensation i sometimes have with worse than normal blemishes
the next day i wake up it's incredibly smaller
it seems to be making a difference
if i could give it more than 5 stars i would!
works just as well as more expensive acne spot treatments
after a week my 16 year old's skin did in fact look much clearer
since this one go out too fast
i hope it's little bigger
so far so good.
you no longer feel anything
a little goes a long way and i love the scent.
concealer so much easier
i don't think i've ever used a product i've liked more
after just 4 days of using this my skin looks so much brighter
looked way younger than it's 68 years
the downside is that i ran out of this product a lot faster than i would have liked
i seem to go through it quicker than any other cream i have
loved it so much
there might be better moisturizers out there
it's richer than the original
other than that loved it
after all i did try most of the higher end ones
it works so well alone
is no longer dull looking
is comparable to much more expensive br
the smell was a bit stronger than i anticipated
a little goes a long way.
a little goes a long way
i definitely suggest it for anyone needing long-lasting moisture
not much of a scent which i like
a little goes a long way also.
it seems as though people with more sensitive skin may not have had as good as an experience with it
i've spend so much money on trying to find something that would work for me
a little goes a long way.
i love this face moisturizer so much!
i can't believe how much better my skin looks
my skin is softer than ever
many of the reviews had me worried that its scent would be too much
i couldn't be happier
i love it so much.
anyway i went on sephora's website to look for an in expensive
a little bit goes a long way
a little goes a long way
so far i have no complaints
was weary to try this because it has a slightly perfum smell
so far no complaints
not as much as my previous moisturiser
keep in mind that a little goes a long way
those areas are always at their worse
in the summer it leans more towards normal.
i hope it works as well in the winter.
genetics is a big part of having dark circles too
buying a lot more- wish i could use one everyday for my tired
more bang for your buck.
crows feet are much softer
my eye area looked a little lighter
that is significantly more expensive
i will buying many more times.
i ended up leaving it on longer than recommended because it just felt so nice on my eyes
and will certainly order more!
it does make a little bit of a difference
how many times can i use this ?
i wonder if i can use it more than once ?
i certainly feel fresher
this works better than some of the truly expensive masks
give me a little relief
it even out my tone
it definitely made that area feel more cooled
not as much as i was hoping
cannot wait to get more
wish it wasn't so costly
i think it does help with looking more refreshed
you can use more than once :
not quite as much as i would have hoped for
my rating would be much lower
much better after using this product
this made my evening 900% better.
dark circles looked better after one use
// i know the usual review says for one time this is expensive
wish you could buy in a three pack or something so they were just a little cheaper
it would be better if i could get more for the same price
my eyes did end up being much less puffy
unfortunately, the effects aren't long-lasting.
or not much sleep
it works much better if is storage on the ridge for a little bit before
i wish there was more than one in the pack.
how much it actually works
45 minutes later i looked much better
and i realized how much i needed it.
a little bit of this product goes a long way.
i recommend for anyone needing a little eye depuffing
i just wish it was a little cheaper or that it had multiple uses
i see how you could use it more than once
my eyes look better and feel better.
longer than the package says
pretty much adult acne under control
i've spent so much money
it has also made my skin seem smoother
my confidence is higher than ever thanks to this.
my makeup goes on so much smoother
it started more breakouts
the next even worse than before
my face has never looked better
it stung a little when i put it on
sometimes with a little luck
it's a little on the expensive side
it's a good value too- just two tiny pumps twice a day
a little bit goes a long way for this huge bottle
my skins never been better
plus i can actually see how much product i have left in this bottle design
a little goes a long way.
it has already helped me so much
it definitely gets better the more you use it
the texture was much smoother
it looks brighter, younger and healthier.
i've used about half so far
nothing has helped so far!
everything seemed to make my acne worse then i tried this
a little goes a long way for certain this should last a good long while
less oil as well as even
my skin is much clearer
was much more cost effective than seeing a dermatologist
at first i was iffy because it seemed to make my skin worse
i need more than just this
like a lot of other reviewers have already stated: a little goes a long way
its slowly, very very slowly, getting better.
as its hard to find any more
i could not be happier
my skin also appears much smoother.
not as intense as before
my skin did seem a little less refined over time
which sephora no longer carries
though i do make sure to rub it in as much as possible
my skin does look better
i overdid it a little
my skin is in so much better shape since starting to use it- much smoother
while it seems to cost a bunch
it's a more than 6 month supply
actually works for a while
which is amazing since top of the line full strength retinoids couldn't do as much
i might be better off just going to see a dermatologist
if i could find something better i would not purchase again because it is rather pricey
i feel like your face can become very dependent on the product which eventually really hurt the pockets
so far i love it
a little goes a long way!
after 3 or 4 weeks my skin was changing more softer
i will continue to try more ptr prodcuts because i have fallen in love with the two i have tried so far
it actually made things worse
used more than half the bottle so far
this product is so much more than i expected!
more even skin tone
it is not nearly as bad
even if it's a little too expensive for you
a little goes a long way.
was wanting something less expensive
as i have oily skin already it does not make it worse
it is too expensive for the amount that they give you
or how much there was to start with
so far i am in love
the lotion seems a little heavier
not too much for my oily areas
i gave it a try even tho it's a bit more expensive than i remember the ddf being
out as much as i thought it would
as far as the acne part
a little goes a long way also.
i wish the bottle lasted longer though for the price
so my perception of a product may be different than a females
so far it has been working for me
it's a little pricey for the amount that i got out of it
--that is how much i love this product
granted that you don't put too much on
it feels so much softer and youthful looking.
only 4 stars because it is a little pricey
not because one is better than the other
well at least no more flaky skin
a little goes a long way.
this actually balanced it out
this product is almost too good to be true.
you only need a little bit
it goes a long way
my skin looks so much better after i started using this line
it is a bit pricey for the quality
you can never apply too much!
or more to the point
it had a heavier feel to it
foundation was just too much product for my skin
unfortunately i have too much discoloration
it lasts for months since you just need a little amount to cover all your face
the only problem is i find that you use quite a bit of product
my skin looks worse without it.
when you first put it on it feels a little greasy
this is better then all of them
and it really does make pores smaller.
it can just make the problem worse
sometimes just most of the day
seemed a bit drying but not too bad.
they are no longer ingrown which means i no longer have scarring issues
i 've been using it for 2 days so far
it does make it brighter
i foud this product was a little difficult to put on
i do notice more even skin tone since starting to use it
my skin is also much brighter with more even skin tone
the tubes last a lot longer than they say
so a bit less costly
this helps it look brighter
it was more smooth and even.
so far so good.
you don't need very much
if you use too much it just balls up
a little bit goes a very long way
so perhaps this was overkill for me
hesitant to spend this much money
it works pretty quickly too.
i am told the more you use it that it just keeps getting better
it also has a different texture than anything else i have ever used
will have to use it a little longer
overall more even tone
my skin is definitely more even in texture
this one lasts longer than my normal skin care products
i could tell the area around it look brighter
my skin has never looked better.
younger, fresher, clearer, all i can say is wow!
yes it is a little pricey
after just one day my face does look healthier
they are already looking younger
was just about to order more
my boyfriend has made mention that my skin looks better
i can't wait to see how much brighter my skin will be after using it for even longer
those are my go too !!
makes makeup application easier, too.
just generally more refreshed looking
so far it actually does plump up dehydrated skin
i would say i have a hard time seeing results with many skin care products
my skin is much calmer
this balanced it to the point where i barely produce as much oil anymore
it does seem to help control the oil a little bit
my skin feels much softer
could not be happier
my skin has never felt better
my skin has never felt better
my skin went crazy a little more than usual on the dry side
a little goes a long way
no moisturizer has ever made much of a difference
it can feel a bit stick initially
around my nose more than usual that my moisturizer just couldn't seem to alleviate the issue
a bonus my foundation goes on 10x better
i couldn't be happier
makeup that much smoother
just a little bit -- easy to extend to entire face
allowed me to maintain perfectly balanced skin condition so far
that my makeup lasts longer
nothing has worked better
i tried quite a few more expensive things
couldn't love this stuff more!!!!
it seems like i have had less breakouts
the only reason this gets four stars is because the product is so thin that its easy to use it up
i didn't feel like it gave my skin any more benefit other than moisturization
from caudalie do a little more for my skin
i gave this 4 stars only because i find it a little pricey
better to stock up when they have some in store.
it goes a long way
it did help slightly
really enjoying this so far!
could not be happier with it
which smells much nicer than how i just described it
pushed it a side thinking it was just like any other typical oil that i have in my collection
a little does go a long way
i do wish it had one of those little delicate pumps
i love it so much though
a little goes a long way
better than anything else i had used before
i actually use this to take off my makeup as well
it takes a lot each time
wish it was a little more affordable
would have been great if it was a bigger bottle
skin is much softer which i like
it makes it easier to control the amount you use so none gets wasted
way cheaper than this one though
s/neck/body so far
a little goes a long way
i even find it works well under makeup.
a little on the pricey side-
gave it 4 stars because it is so expensive
so much better than the nude oil.
the smell is too strong as much as it pleasant
still a bit too strong for me
as so far for me it's been this little magical gem
5 oz bottle is better than the 1
a little goes a long way
which is a good thing seeing as it's so expensive
it does have me reaching for it less
love this so much!
a bit pricey for me
i also really like the spray-on function -- so far i haven't had any issues with it
the only problem is that it goes too fast...
a bit better on the price
even better absorbed than the josie maran
even that made my face look
a little goes a long way
if my face is ever feeling dry i just apply a little more to the area than i normally would
it was a much better deal
it has made my skin so much healthier
a little goes a long way
a whiff in store was much different than using it that night
was a little skeptical about using oil as a moisturizer since i thought it would be greasy
more toned for hours
or i use it more than once a week just on my cheeks as i think too much use might set off my zits/oil
it's made my skin so much more bright
i live very far from a sephora
none of them works as good as this one
i love it so much.
it makes my skin so much smoother
i love it so much
the area is no longer tight
there's also a bit of something sweeter mixed in
my skin always feels a little softer
his skin was far less red
the next day my face is so much better for make up applications
my skin has never looked better!
the redness is alot better.
tacky if you leave it on longer than the suggested 10 minutes
gets more difficult to take off
the areas of my face where i used it felt so much better
didn't get around to using it until one day i went tanning for a little too long
break my skin with so many itchy burning bumps which would have taken it much longer to heal
will be stocking up because i'll react to new make up products quite often so now i can control it rather than having these reactions last for weeks
i like to use on the days in between my more harsher masks to give my skin a break
even though there are other masks i like better
it helped my skin so much
this adds so much moisture
i found it a little cumbersome to apply
this works just as good as more expensive masks.
it actually helps all my little red bumps!
my cheeks no longer feel like s
this just makes me feel a little bit better after i've been super aggressive with my skin
as i often wake up with just a bit more oil than normal
works much better than the thisty mud in my opinion
is much much cheaper
perhaps if i was dryer i'd notice more of an impact though
truly makes my skin so much softer once washed off
so i'll definitely be buying more!
can use up to so many times
my only wish is that it would come in a bigger version because i love it so much
i still have oil
my skin has a more even apperance
the smell is also a bit too strong
since my makeup makes me more shiny than usual anyway
i rarely wear anything other than eye make-up
perfect during the summer though during the winter i use a little more
it became to much to h
my makeup looks better over it
it lasts a little more than a month
in the fl summer this works much better than anything else i have used
it's really humid where i live which makes it worse
it gets worse in the summer
i feel like even just using a dime size each day it runs out way too quickly
it usually makes my face look more
it even makes my makeup look better because it keeps it looking matte throughout the day as well
you just need a little
this is a good product however i find it does not work nearly as well as dermadoctor's tease zone
it has controlled my oil so much
food products are much higher than in the u
feel better about the safety of the product i'm putting on skin
the winter has made it even tighter
feels a lot healthier since i've started using it
some really expensive ones out there in the market
although it helped with the dry flaky skin i was getting i did notice the texture was a little too much for regular use
probably more for 'rescue' situations
very little goes a long way
honestly a little goes a long way
so you don't need to use as much which makes it last even longer
also a little bit goes a long way.
i tried so many different creams
not quite enough for the winter
this moisturizer is one of the better ones i've tried
i couldn't be happier
i just wish it was less expensive
most of caudalie's stuff i have used has gone a very long way for a fraction of the cost of other products
well no more, thanks caudalie.
more in the winter
quite expensive for what you get though.
my skin looks better than it ever has
i just wish it came in a bigger tube!
after some deliberation in the end i went with this one because not only did it have a very pleasant smell
a little goes a long way!
i gave it four stars because the scent can be a little overwhelming
so far i like it, only used it for a week.
so far so good
so much so that i can use it in the mornings before "applying my face"
nothing has seemed to help
it turned out that this is pretty much the same cream
my skin did got tighter and brighter.
which goes very far
i couldn't be happier
only a little is needed
if you need a bit more
just a little goes a long way
wish it was bigger!
i think many of the negative reviews are from people who used too much product -- a tiny bit goes a very long way
this is the only product i have used so far that actually works on dark circles
really appear less dark in the mornings
they are considerably lighter after using this product for about a week
they are lighter after only a few uses.
it works that well
after doing a little research to underst
the dark circles do get better
works well to make under your eyes brighter
my dark circles are much lighter now
it seems to have helped quite a bit as an under-eye moisturizer
it has seemed to help quite a bit
for about half the cost i got just as good results
this one is still going strong.
to be honest i didn't expect results because no product claiming to reduce or cure dark circles has ever significantly done so
so the dark circles are probably there for good
to me the price is a little high
so far, so good.
on me it works better than any other under concealer i've tried
this makes everything all better!
a little goes a long way
this is the only product i've used so far that has actually shown any effectiveness
a little goes a very long way!
as long as you don't use too much
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way.
less dark circles though
i also tend to use a little less in the morning to avoid having too many layers of product around my eye area
they have gotten much better
it's hard to say what 30% lighter looks like
i still have a ways to go
it makes you look immediately better
i just think it makes it harder to gauge how much is going to come out especially when the container is closer to empty
ive always had dark circles no matter how much rest i get
haven't used long enough to see dark circles improve
so far it's been working well
the cream runs out more quickly than other br
none of them actually work to lighten them for good
so far so good
he thinks they have faded a bit
i no longer deal with that
no moisturizer has even come close to being as good as this oil
it works better than any other oil i've tried under makeup
it just sinks in very well.
my skin tone looks way more even
its helped it heal so much
it did sting my face a little
now that my skin has gotten better from repetitive use of differin
this has seriously helped my skin out so much that i kind of want to buy another bottle just to have a backup
it never feels too much
with my week's use i haven't even used that much
my face has never been more hydrated in my entire life
it's a little too heavy for the summer
realize now its more combination
if i do get one or two spots it goes away much faster than it did in the past
it might be little
i've tried so many oils
i've even tried ones that are more expensive than this
not so much to break me out
i definitely notice my skin looks better after having used this for 3 weeks now
even toned if i use consistently
feel like i use more than the couple of drops suggested to have any effect
i've tried quite a few oils
honestly improves the quality of it so much
makes my makeup application so much easier since it all just glides on
the best part: i don't even have to use much.
and a little goes a long way!
a little goes a really long way.
this face oil is by far my favourite.
the bottle lasts a decent time too.
can become "greasy/oily" looking quickly if too much is used
it worked better than by itself
i've recently gotten a lot more into skin care
i think people are using too much of the product
i did a little research
a little goes a long way
one bottle goes a long way.
which is a bit more generous than other br
the only issue is it's a little expensive.
it has completely changed my skin for the better
since using this my skin has never felt more moisturizer
is softer than ever
a little goes a long way
my skin is rather combination
any more will make you pretty greasy
this works so much better for me
i feel the original was better
they seemed to become smaller
my skin has never been better.
more new ones-some just sit on the skin
so far i'm loving everything about it!
the bottle is a little pricey
a little goes a long way
i wanted one i could wear under my moisturizer during the day since my face is becoming drier as i get older
it is a little pricey but it lasts forever!
there's so much product that it will last for a long time
i can slightly see a lighter bit of difference in the spots
evenness look at least 40% better
made the bumpy skin there smoother too
maybe ill give them a shot
fine lines are much milder
they seem less congested
my skin in general looks much more dewy
i hate being so spendy with face care as i tend to try something for a few weeks
probably will buy the larger bottle next time even though its more than i would ever want to spend
my skin has improved so much since i've started using this
literally every morning my skin looks a little more amazing
i look younger even though i am only in my early 20s
my skin looks more alive and less dull.
a little goes a long way
which is going to cost a lot more than $100
you don't need to use too much to get a good amount of moisture
i pay a lot of attention to my skin
so far so good
my skin is looking better already
the two more things i like about this: 1
it is indeed much gentler than retin a
must have for better skin!
woke up to a much lighter
a little goes a long way
it could leave you looking worse
(of course, we spend more along the way...!!)
so far has brightened it a bit
i've gotten so many compliments
she didnt have too much knowledge of this
my skin looks better than it ever has
it also lasts quite a while for me because i find a little goes a long way
the dropper allows you to control exactly how much you want to use rather than a pump that always dispenses too much
i just don't think the price should be quite that steep
overall my skin seems more even
so far so good.
i really believe this bottle has lightened by dark spots a little
nothing seems to work on my dark spots so a little is a lot to me
my skin is brighter and looks so much better.
the combo together has me clearer than i've been in years
the bottle looks like it will last quite a while
i feel my skin has a more even tone
this is definitely better
even though this is pretty expensive
it is in no way harsh on the skin.
my skin has been so even
it's lasted me quite some time
my skin looks so much better
this product seems like it will last quite a while
the smell is a little off
so far i feel like my skin is firmer
my skin is so much brighter.
my makeup lasts longer
have quite a bit of this left
even though the product seems expensive
no longer do i have to worry about getting breakouts
i've even changed makeups because i can use something much lighter now
my skin looks so much brighter.
my skin has never been better
my skin tone is much more even
i couldn't be happier.
i would even go as far to say that this is the cure for acne
it's a little more pricy than i'd like
sometimes the oil actually gets drawn out
i love the actual product so much!
since i haven't used it too much i will continue to use as a night mask
it has helped my skin so much
it is so hard to pump out any product
just use much less
it is a little pricey
i am willing to pay a little more to have clear skin
for a lot less money
i can look past that since the actually product works so well
while it was a bit of a splurge for me
the smell is a lot more pleasant than other sulphur masks that i have tried
it has improved my skin so much!
a little goes a long way with this one.
this definitely helped to stop it from getting worse
this stuff has helped my skin so much.
mostly just as a spot treatment
my skin has improved so much because of this.
i love this product so much!
this one is by far one of the better products i've purchased
it goes a long way
works better that way
my skin has never looked better
my face did slightly break out
i hope to see more from this line
it is amazing and a little goes a long way!
t's actually more cost effective than other spot treatments
this just works so well.
have noticed that it's help my pimples come to a head faster
makeup looks better on.
i still did get some small ones
is better than having my face full of acne
does have the occasional break out like most people it is a struggle to find a great spot treatment
my pores looked much smaller
my skin just keeps looking better
that too is no longer a problem
i no longer have to worry about my face getting oily during the day
the jar itself contains waaaaay more product than i could possibly use in a reasonable amount of time
t-zone have never looked better
overall like this product better
from making me breakout worse
considerably less with the use of this mask
makes my skin feel much smoother
it really does prevent my acne from getting any bigger
all it did was make me zit bigger.
a little goes a long way.
i like this mask even better than the glamglow!
this works better than any over the counter mask i've ever tried
not so much for others
by morning my face is much clearer
it is much more gentle and definitely less flaky.
it can be a little drying sometimes though
i actually got quite a few samples from the store to try on
my skin is softer than it's been in years
this cream is everything and more!
my face looks brighter even tone
a little goes along way!
my whole face has changed for the better
start out with just a bit
you can always get a bit more if you need it
a little goes a long way
my acne are pretty much gone
it's true that a little goes a long way
my skin has improved so so much
a little goes a long way
my skin changed for the better
even though the price tag is larger than i would normally spend on anything
it might be a bit heavy for the summer.
barely ever break out my whole life
little goes a long way
while this cream has done little to that end
a little does go a long way.
which is slightly cheaper
i love this product so much.
my skin has never responded to a product better
a little goes a long way too.
not sure how good this one goes during warmer times
it is expensive but it sure does work!
a little goes a long way
my makeup went on so much smoother
noticed how much smoother my skin was
i saw how expensive if was
also after i've used one of my more intense face masks because it calms my skin much better than my everyday moisturizer
though i slept too little
drank too much on that trip
it only takes a little to cover my whole face.
tell much difference over all from other products
would not pay nearly this much for it
a little goes a long way
smoother than ever before

a little goes a long way which makes me justify the price
it made my skin too even younger!
also because this is a quality product not much is needed so the container will last a long time
a little goes a long way
the real difference is how much my face glows
it also helps when i'm irritated or having a reaction to something
one way to cut costs i suppose
really nice products for those with a higher budget
makes your skin look better after just two days
will probably be too heavy in summer
it feels like a high end cream, too.
it takes only a little to apply.
what i discovered is that i had to use so little of the product
this cream does so much!
you get a little confidence not noted on the box
more that it need
although it is a bit pricey
every time i get a bit cheap
the bigger results have been on my husb
this lasts a lot longer
my skin so much more softer and brighter.
the jar has a bit different design love it as well
makes me look well rested even if i don't feel it-price may be a bit steep
my complexion is more even
a little goes a long way
which i think helps everything absorb better
i couldn't believe how much nicer my skin looked after just one night of combining these two products
really firmer after starting it
it could be a little less expensive
the only thing i would say is dior is slightly less greasy
have less of a heavy feeling
my face looks more plump
the dark spots are getting lighter.
my skin looks better
complexion looks brighter, more even.
unfortunately the duo is no longer sold at sephora
you generally get what you pay for
my own fault because i always thought sun damage was just when your face burns throughout the years- not easier for people that don't burn :-/
because of its feel a little goes a long way
my skin so well
it works so well
the texture is so much better
feel that it wastes too much product
i wished it had faster results
smoother every time i use it
my face feels tighter
which was just too dark for me
just after a week of daily use my skin is getting so much even is amazing
i even use a little under my eyes to lighten dark circles
plus loved the smell of camu camu much better
my skin has never looked better
all over looks much brighter
i will give it more time
neck so a tiny bit goes a very long way
within 2 days my skin looked so much better
so much so that i feel i am wasting so much of the product
so far however have seen no difference
love this product since it absorbs so quickly too
it seems to be more even in tone and texture.
looks better than ever
i couldn't be happier with it.
please figure out a better way for it to come out so none of it gets wasted
it actually does what it promises to do: leaves skin brighter
my problem is the product is so thin that you lose a little down the bottle with every oump
its just too expensive for that
i couldn't be happier
i look less tired
i like this product better than other serums i've tried that never seemed to do anything
since i usually don't see much results
like other reviewers i have to agree that this is slightly sticky when first going on
even the girls in sephora hadn't heard too much about it
skintone is becoming more even
my skin just feels better to the touch
unevenness its helped so far
i like the whole idea of having something 30 x's more stronger
i love it so far
my face just looks & feels smoother!
a little goes a long way, too.
i love this eye cream so much
i realized that i had used too much
you need very little to make it work.
a little bit goes a long way
have been getting lots of compliments on my skin lately
it's much easier to correct when you're starting with a brightened base
the heavier potions to 'brighten' get to be to much
i think they are a little less puffy, as well.
my only complaint is more my fault than anything-it stings like a mother if you get it even a little close to your lash line
i can see a little difference around my eyes
i think the longer i use it
it will get better so fingers cross
much brighter canvas to work on
i no longer need moonbeam
good bang for the buck because you use very little
it's better than than the previous, blue version.
because it has a little bit of color when it goes on
i suppose this prevents fine lines since i haven't noticed my eyes getting worse since using it
a little goes a very long way.
make me look less tired
a little goes a long way.
my eyes were looking 10 years older than they should
i did not give it five stars because although my dark circles do look a little brighter i haven't noticed a big difference
its a bit on the pricey side
a little goes a long way
comes out of tube a bit too quickly
too much too fast
i think you would be better off using a corrector
it is a better route to take to remove the dark circles
i found this cream if i put too much on makes my skin burn
no more dark circles!
try not to rub too much when applying make up
on particularly tough mornings i'll also put a little bit on my ring finger
if you push down on the pump slightly too hard it's easy to waste a lot of product
plus a little goes a long way with this product.
my skin was so much clearer
the better my skin got
so far this works great
a little goes a long way.
better than most of my other moisturizers.
even though i have combination skin
i also find that a little goes a long way with this product
this product seems to do a decent job at that--my skin is a bit softer
might work better on someone with slightly less dry skin than mine
no breakouts thus far.
first aid beauty, i just love you so much!!!
a little goes a long way.
it was a little tacky feeling especially if you use too much
a little goes a long way with this one
this has really helped as long as i use it consistently
i look forward to trying more of this br
a little goes a long way.
this is a light lotion probably more for summer.
lately when i use it
it's better than most drug store br
i think there must be something better out there
i would have given it full stars if the smell were more pleasant
as something a little less thick
it's much much lighter than the ultra repair cream
i wish the formula was a tad heavier
it is so light
it also has never made any skin problem i've had worse
adding more did nothing to help
i did take off a star because i think its a little too pricey for the size of the item
at first i was a little bit skeptical about buying this at the store because of the high price
a little does go a long way
if i use too much that is the only time i feel oily at all
i do not find that this hydrates too much
a little goes a long way
the product is a bit pricey in my opinion
my usual moisturizer got a little pricey
a little goes a long way.
will sometimes use it at night as well
a more even skin tone
probably better suited for someone with balanced skin
noticed how much better my skin looks
a little is all you need
skin does seem to look a little more even overall
there is little to no smell
have no idea how much is left in the jar
i always buy as much as possible
people have always thought that i look considerably younger than i am
maybe older people will see more results with it
i struggled for months trying to find something cheaper that does the same thing
now it has a more chemical
little goes a long way with this stuff
i found my skin looked much smoother
my dryness has gotten much better because of this moisturizer
it pretty much erased all my age spots like magic
so far i love this one the most
i think it's better to use it during the winter
it has no spf so
a little goes a long way
so far my skin looks great
theres always a few more days worth of cream inside
y to give it a little push
get more out when your h
i don't see much of an improvement"
i look more even
i realized just how much they were actually helping
because it even put the other
has even changed the texture of my skin for the better
also my skin appears more even toned
changed the texture so much
a little goes a long way with this product" well she was right
made my skin look better than it has in years
fair skin that isn't getting any younger
i saw more results with this product with much fewer uses than the more high end products i was using for over a month
my fine lines look better
moisturizes much better than other products i have purchased
help make my skin look brighter/younger
it's been 3 weeks, and so far i love it!
my skin looks much smoother and clearer.
hopefully see even better results
the pores are still there, but much smaller.
overall it does what it says
it is by far one of the few products i can wear without makeup because it mattifies my skin
so that when i clean my skin in the evening it is so much cleaner to begin with
improve the looks of them a lot
my pores look better
i can tell my pores are getting smaller
are definitely less congested
like many others my pores seem to be larger than those who have more dryer skin
strange how the samples are always better than the product you actually buy
this seemed better for the amount you get
my skin looks tighter
i think some people experience pain because they put too much on
it stings a little in the beginning
my face got irritated if i used it too often :
only if you're getting more
make my skin more even toned
there isn't one other one on the planet i would spend that much on
it felt a little tight
a little goes a long way
pretty expensive for such a little thing
a little goes a long with with this product!
i feel like my make up applies much easier when i've used this either the morning of or night before
the coloring even appears more even
it's like a really expensive replacement for self-harm
since a little goes a fairly long way
its even better when you can get it in a value set
by the next morning my skin looks 10x better than normal
i tend to put this on way longer than recommended
sometimes on those longer sessions
as my face has literally never looked better
not any less red
so far, i'm loving it.
softer for me it looked a little clearer aswell
it stings a little at first
couldn't justify spending so much $$ on a mask
my face has never felt smoother.
my skin looks much tighter
was a little too intense for my skin
it tingles so bad i didn't think i could leave it on more than a few minutes
it's a little more than a tingle
i found it wasn't too rough on my skin
it is a little rough putting on
it does feel like more of a burn
my skin did look noticeably better after i took it off
my skin tone appears more even
sephora needs to be a little bit more realistic to the average every day woman's pocket
which works much better than any mask ever could
i find this even better than the youth mud
my skin felt better than ever after
i can easily see where this product would give a more burning sensation
may even irritate slightly
it's like when you put on too much icyhot.
great price, little goes long way.
i've seen the circles get sooo much smaller
it works well under makeup so that's a plus too.
look smoother as well
it's very cooling and a little goes a long way!
maybe i was using too much of it at a time.
a little of this goes a long way.
just generally makes the skin around my eyes look
it helps so much with breakouts
a little goes a long ways!!!
product better than i expected!!
my dark circles are much lighter
actually pleasantly surprised with both how much i like the formula
as i don't see it as much of a trouble area on me
you need more than this
there won't be too much
a little heavy if used much
so a little goes a long way
find that i wake with my eyes much less puffy
don't apply too much product
those who noticed a residue are using too much per application
usually the hype is bigger
better than the product
so far so good
it applies far too much serum
it takes the puffiness out of my eyes better than anything i've ever tried
i think it applies way too much product
longer than most serums
maybe i'm just putting too much on
a little goes a very long way
so even though the price point is steep
i feel like it is worth it because not very much product is needed
use less than the recommended amount which seems to be better for my skin
my skin condition is much better
a little goes a long way
i couldn't be happier with the results
others have as well.
i am now more comfortable going out with just a fresh face
another tip--a little of this product goes a long way
i am nearing 50 so my skin has become dull looking
its a little bit too heavy for summer use however
i like that a little goes a long way.
my fine lines seem smoother
my skin is brighter than ever
even better than a regular moisturizer
since using this it is not really a problem any more
the price tag is alittle hefty which is the reason it only got 4 stars instead of 5
the tone more even than before
love that a little bit goes such a long way
can say i am enjoying even the short-term ones
with so much help in the other areas
help quite a bit on my deeper wrinkles
said my skin has never looked better as far as tone
a little goes a long way.
although i had oily skin was i was younger my skin tends more towards normal these days
as far as lightening dark spots
perhaps this effect takes time?
they just appear softer
if you use too much
you don’t need to use too much.
it's good to mention that a very little amount of this cream goes a long way
this moisturizer has been great so far.
it felt too heavy for me
it did take awhile for it to absorb because it is thicker
it goes a long way
my acne marks heal more quickly-or just get lighter which ever way it's a win-win
seems to make it brighten even more
smooth out my skin more too
it does make makeup application much nicer
with so much help in the other areas
help quite a bit on my deeper wrinkles
'm guessing a full-size would've lasted me a little over half a year
a little goes a long way.
more than 10 yrs younger
this is one which worked too well for me perhaps because i was using it in combination with the essence
a little went a long way, too.
my skin felt so much softer
one minor complaint is that it can be a slightly sticky if you use too much
a little goes a long way
all i needed was less than a pump
a little goes a very long way.
i also felt bit of tighter around my neck
a little goes a long way
see if there is any more improvement in the lines
i do think it has helped make my face a bit more full
can easily control how much comes out.
it definitely has left my face with a smoother
is smoother than it has been in a long time
when i saw the price the first thing i thought is there are a lot of less expensive moisturizers out there that would perform in a similar way
skintone is a bit more even
this is one of those type of lotions that a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way
this product may be more expensive than i usually purchase
a tiny amount goes a long way so the price probably isn't as steep as it looks when you consider how long the bottle lasts
i find this to be a much better night cream than a lot of the others i have used
it might be because of not using a heavier cream
my skin is so much softer
i am slightly bummed that i think one bottle will only last about 45 days or so
has little to no smell
after a week of use my skin was much firmer
has little to no scent
seems like this is as far as i can get.
hopefully i can get a little more out of this product
i love what i've seen so far
i am definitely more inclined
even better than that
i still have around a bit less than half the bottle left
my skin is looking healthier than it used to
you get more than double the product than most moisturizers
a little goes a long way
i am 49 and am told often i look much younger.
have some more to go
neck easy so a bottle should last quite some time
it is not much more than any of the better products out there
it was more convienient for me
my skin is slowly pulling in to it's younger shape without all the drama other products seem to create
i find i use very little of any of the products
if i were a bit younger i feel this would have been my top choice because it feels lighter on the face
the only downside is that it hurts so much if gets into my eyes
a little goes a long way
even if that much
still feels very full
a little goes a long way with this cleanser
this product surprised me in it being much better than the essence
it is much more than what i hoped for.
all in all better
the product foams up so a little goes a long way.
it's just too expensive
if what one of the reviews above is true about it lasting a very long time
it's clearer and softer than its ever been.
my skin has never been or felt better.
even though i use a lot every time
i think you have many other better options
i still have 1/4 tube left because you need very little of it
it has really helped with my skin in the summer that is prone to more breakouts with the extra product i wear
more so than using a face wash.
just a little goes a long away
it still does the job well
i still like it
probably trief more than 20 different products
spread very easily so you don't need much
i put a little bit of water all over my face
i know this is a bit expensive
this cleanser is much lighter
i wish the cleanser was a little thicker
eyebrows because it's a little harder to get out of hair than off skin
2-3 pumps are plenty enough
it is barely an oil, or so it feels like.
perhaps in the winter i could use it more often because my facial skin is less drier in those months
i love it so much
the cost is definitely on higher side
still it hasn't given me any breakout problems so far
this is so light
you get quite a bit more than the other brands.
this is by far
as there are many other good oil cleansers for much less
you only need a little bit
it goes a long way
it can tend to be greasy if you apply too much.
each morning my skin looks a little healthier
i hope you find that your skin has improved a little with each use
the first night i put way too much on
as there is a lot of product
that was way too much
a little goes a long way
many people have noticed my skin tone being more even
if you use a smaller amount on a wet face it becomes easier to ware
a little goes a long way
a little goes a very long way
so a jar of sk -ii lasts much longer than any other moisturizer i have used as well
i love this eye cream so much!
a little goes a long way
i like that they give you a little tool to scoop the product out
a little definitely goes a long way
a note of caution, a little goes a very long way.
if you use too much
the good thing about a little going a long way is that the product will last for quite some time
i felt i lost too much that way to my h
my skin has never been better
i would say slightly more youthful in appearance
it was too much moisture for me
as far as packaging goes
a little goes a long way.
it really does have lasting moisture too!
the last thing i would mention is that a little bit goes a long way with this cream
a little goes a long way.
it does go a long way
the better the product"
a little bit does go a long way
one pump goes a long way
first of all a little goes a long way.
now i have noticed myself wearing much less foundation or going without it
because i won't feel the need to spend more money on foundation
that seems to help it soak in faster
the price is a little high
a little goes a long way
it has made my skin tone more even
a little does go a long way
a little goes a long way
have noticed my skin is much more even
a little goes a long way.
or even made things worse
and it lasts, a little goes a long way!
i heard so much about the brand.
said it looks brighter
a little goes a long way
my skin tone is more even
have generally younger looking
don't need more oil
it feels a little tacky for a little while
maybe over time i just won't create many more
a little of this goes a long way.
two pumps is plenty and one is just enough.
i can honestly say that my skin hasn't felt this soft in more than a decade
just this weekend was guessed more than 10 years younger
my skin also feels so much softer and smoother.
a little goes a long way so you'll have this for months
because of how much i have to pay to 'try' their products
less than one pump
so much more even
use the product anyway rather than return it
over time my skin has become more balanced
i did it too fast
too much came out
i really feel it diminished my finer lines
more lifted sooner than you would expect
it felt much tighter & firmer.
lancome's doesn't require too much amount each time
it does have more perfume than i'd like
too bad it's so expensive!
i just tried some samples of even more expensive creams
her skin looks much more youthful than it did before she started using it
now it looks like my creases are worse
i couldn't be happier!
i loved it so much i went out
though other lancome products are good too
i think my dark circles are lighter too
some people may want something heavier.
a little bit expensive but it's a good eye cream
fine lines have gotten better
they look younger and a lot less tired!
you don't need to use very much.
i like this one much better.
after a little more time
the eye cream is less harsh than that
one of my eye is more droopy than the other
no more eye bags
my eyes are a lot bigger
it has helped my fine lines around my orbital bone plus my lids look sooo much better
a little is all you need
more so when the puffiness is really bad
the older i get i seem to have one eyelid that is falling down faster then the other :
applying my eyeshadow has been so much easier now
the only reason i'm not giving it five stars is because it was just the tiniest bit too oily for my skin
you just downgrade to something less intense
i got a lot more out of the container
this stuff is too expensive to waste it
it is the best thing i have found so far in softening lines
a little goes a long way.
a little goes a long way!
maybe i should wait it longer.
i don't notice it much different than others i have used
also, fine lines seem to be gone.
it always gets worse before it gets better
can feel my face getting worse
warning: depending on your skin type it can hurt a little
this worked better for me than pore strips as they are not able to pull many blackheads out of my skin
keep in mind ones skin gets worse before it gets better
i love this mask so much!
the glamglow one will work better for you than the sephora
it def makes it go away faster
which is much more affordable
it does burn a little at first
my skin always feels so much cleaner
skin looked so much clearer
a little goes a long way.
it came off without much fuss
this product minimized them so much it looks like they are gone
my skin is happier than ever
my makeup application the next day is always so much smoother looking
i expected better quality from sephora it was the real letdown
love the bigger size even more.
it clears up acne faster than any mask i have ever tried
it is a little strange
a little goes a long way
don't make much of a difference
my progress so far with this mask is i have not had oily skin in months
said that masks help with pores much better than moisturizers
you don't need very much to make a difference
it did leave me a little bit red afterwards
my skin has never been more clear
this mask works so well.
it does sting a little
i can see it pulling oil out of my pores which look smaller when i am done
other than that i do love this product just a bit too pricey
less pink than before i got this product
it makes my skin look so much better after using it
quite a lot of acne problems
only complaint is how expensive it is for how little you get
i love this so much.
it works so well on my skin
i couldn't be happier
so far i love this product.
my skin looks 10x better after
actually work rather than smell like a fruit cake
you only need a little
it also doesn't dry out my skin if i use it more than once a week
during the mask i already felt better
my skin was clearer than it has been for a long time
keep it from getting worse
the pores on my nose are actually disappearing little by little
the only reason i am giving this 4 stars is because the smaller size does not last a long time as i am almost done with it
have been breaking out a lot lately
worse case if i broke out it couldn't be much worse than it already is
i've tried so many masks
its just so smooth
it was way too intense
a little goes a long way.
have gone through that too
now i've used it for 2weeks my skin's getting really better
almost clear so that my make up would be perfect too
i really do wish the jar was bigger for the price
i like this product better than the make a difference plus+ moisturizer from the same line
a little goes a long way with it
though it sometimes feels a little drying
my skin has been much less oily since using
a little goes a long way as well
this has never given me an oil slick
my skin is looking better after only a week
especially enjoy it in the hotter months as it feels so refreshing
my skin looks much younger than some 25-30 year olds
it does not absorb as much as i'd like
a little goes a long way, also.
lead your skin to a better place it ought to have been a long long time ago
i've found that i only need to use a little bit of this
it does work pretty well on most parts of my face
it feels so much softer to the touch
since it's a little cheaper
with this moisturizer a little goes a long way.
i love it so much so far, it smells clean.
i just love this company so much!!
i think it is little pricey for a moisturizer
however it burned my eyes no matter how careful i was
they've all been too weak or greasy
little goes a long way3.
this lasts me a very long time.
spreads so far-- you only need a little dab for your whole face
i would definitely use a primer if i were wearing heavier foundation
a bit too heavy for me right now
i do not like that it takes much longer than the treatment to blend into my skin
my only complain is during the really cold winters i have to use it more than twice a day
have been liking it a lot so far
this moisturiser is just as light
has just gotten worse
i like the smell of the ginzing more
the texture of this one is better
a little goes a long way
retains moisture better than it did before
i also feel as though a little bit of this moisturizer goes a long way compared to other moisturizers i've used in the past
only gave 4 stars because i love the make a difference™ plus + rejuvenating treatment even more
a little bit goes a long way!!
i'd rather have it smells "planty" rather than like chemicals
even though it seems heavy
so far so good
my pores also seem to look smaller
i just got this yesterday and so far i like it!
it may seem like too much
you might be a bit shiny for a little while
a little does go a long way though.
the only reason i'm giving it four stars is because my skin still feels kind of rough
a little goes a long way
this primer helps so much
so far so good with those really annoying red bumps
after using this product my face is so much better
assuming it to be too strong or harsh for my skin
i couldn't be happier with this product!
my makeup still looks good after a long work day
makes me peel a little bit
i don't mind so much because my skin is so slick
it does a good job for about 4 hours
it was better than nothing at all
a little seems to go a long way.
it does last a good 5-6 hours on me which is far better than many similar products i've tried over the years
no matter how many things i have tried my face looks like an oil slick 1 hour after putting on my makeup
even though it says it is for men
actually works out to be cheaper
a little goes a long way.
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way
get the bigger bottle because i wanted to splurge
neck so a little bottle even could go a long way
takes a few uses to see results tho so be patient
had a hard time getting it all over
my nails are stronger and look much healthier!
now i think i'd rather this than some fruity smell
i break out less often
add more after makeup if needed
smells a little too much like canola oil/
even though it has a different purpose
i definitely like it so far
i put way to much on the first time
my skin tone is more even i will definitely be making this a must have from now on
it lasts a long time too!
it has helped my skin look more rejuvenated
i like it because even when i use too much it sinks into my skin
it has helped me so much!
the fragance could be a little bit strong
it is way too expensive for my price range right now
i like my josie maran argan oil better because it soaks in more
it works well prior to makeup too!
sometimes i use it on the morning too.
which made it a bit more skeptical too
it is helping to clear my acne a little
my skin is looking so much better since i use it
using this a moisturizer my skin has improved so much
it will probably be way too much product
it's easier to spread that way
you don't need very much--only a couple small drops will do
even a bit more firm
it actually help fine lines
i will mix it with my under eye concealer's just a little tho
feels more dry much faster
be careful of not using to much though is will make your face looking oilier than ever
since i have no patience
since it's an oil i thought it would makes me produce more oil on my face than normal
i've gotten so many compliments.
it has not caused any new acnes so far
this oil is nothing short of a miracle.
people have noticed my skin become more even
a little does go a long way
my skin looks better in just a few days
i produce about 75% less oil than i did before
i stay way more matte all day
i love it so far
while it does go on a little greasy
every morning i wake up my skin looks so much better
they look so much more diminished in the morning
my complexion is more even
a little goes a long way!
makes it a lot more natural
and my face is more brighter.
i needed something that was more than just a moisturizer
your eyes look so much younger after using this for a period of time
i love the fresh cucumber in my water so what better than to have it in my face cream:
i only take a little bit
i still have a lot left
i like the consistency of this one more
i also don't need much.
this one so far is my favourite
my skin was much clearer
i need something more heavy
a little goes a long way
certain products definitely make it more normal than others
seems to have helped quite a bit
used all of it quite happily
i give this product 4 starts because i prefer pump rather than jars
the it is a little pricey
there are tons of cheaper products that do just as well
after two more lancôme moisturizers i felt my face needed something more
would be good to have some spf in it.
a little goes a long way
also the way it looks without makeup
love this so much also helps with eczema
probably not the best for people who lean more oily
i like this a lot better
didn't get as much relief from the expensive cream
like this a little more because i get that silky feeling with this
it is so light
it is working like a dream so far :
i wish it was a bit cheaper though
i think a little goes a long way.
if you apply too much
a little product definitely does go a long way.
it feels a little sticky at first
don't know how well it would do with heavier scarring
so although it's a little pricey
i am currently using it as my night-time moisturizer after clinique's dramatically different started to feel too greasy on my skin
it's light and a little goes a long way.
you only need a little!
!little goes a long way!!
i think it's slightly lighter than the rose face cream
how i look years younger than i am
a little goes a long way.
i imagine you would need something heavier
so far so good!
today though i look as smooth as a baby!
love the results too much to stop buying
it is a much better way to deliver this rich
i do not have too many wrinkles
it has made them bigger fuller and more plump .
a little goes a long way
it puts the needles no more to shame!
i wouldn't use it around the eyes because it may make the area a little swollen
i hate the thought of spending so much money on a 'moisturizer"
sometimes i just use a little under my eyes
t's hard to tell if it has any long term effect
when i use it i can actually tell my face is plumper
pretty much remains that way for the rest of the day
my skin looks even and younger.
not with this product i have wasted so money in the past
a little goes a long way here.
the deeper ones are improved
comes closer than anything i have tried
your skin looks better and better over time.
it does make skin look better everyday
it is pretty strong so a little goes a long way.
it takes about 25-72 hours to really take an effect so be patient
sometimes it takes more than one application
my skin feels so much smoother
plumps up those little spots where lines would normally be
had so many compliments
so far so good
i think that i'd like this better if my skin was not so sensitive
it stings a little going on
i live under the philosophy that if a little goes a long way
and it's only gotten better!
makes my makeup go on smoother
it hurts sometimes to put pressure there
it is so much better with this lotion
so far so good
that is not long enough for retinol to start working
now i don't know if this was the process that happens before it becomes lighter
this by far works better than anything else i've tried
it's a little more money
which i have noticed stays in place much longer since i started using this product
only need a very little amount.
but most importantly, it shows results.
the fine lines around my eyes have been made even finer
now it's just so much better
so far i love it!
that it did a much better job than the eye cream i had been using
so a little goes a long way
nothing works as well on my lines
don't really have much basis for comparison
the skin around my eyes seem more plump after using this
i feel better about going without makeup on "casual" days
although not as much as i would have liked
may have used too much
perhaps again using too much at night
so far so good
you only need a little bit
and a little goes a long way.
i never thought i would spend this much on an eye cream
don't have more to add just yet
miracle worker is even better
a little because of my genetics
fine lines are a lot smaller
i've spent way more $ for under eye creams that didn't work as well
so far i'm liking it.
less puffy- less tired looking
i still have more to go
the only thing is that it can leave your skin a little dry if you use it too much
my dermatologist had told me other options which would be so much more expensive
it been taking a little while it says 8 week
i think it been a little over 8 week
pigmentation scars this stuff has helped so much
i am sure the longer i use the better it will get
this has made the fading of them go much faster
i would say that it is better right away after a scar appears
it takes much longer
could not be happier
they are visably smaller
t makes it a little harder to blend your foundation
use them so much
might be slow working but definitely working.
first time using this one and so far i love it!
it work albeit slowly for me atleast which i'm ok with because i had very dark hyper pigmentation on my face
they have faded so much since using this
they are already so much lighter than when they heal on their own
so no product is wasted
so far so good.
they also have become so much easier to cover with makeup
it is a bit on the pricier side
my arms look so much better
a little goes a long way!
actually made me break out more
they say it takes a little longer to notice results with this product
needs some time to see it works though :)
things like that- as far as acne scars this is amazing
this does more than you might think for such an impossible task
my skin is much smoother
those were maybe lighter?
i can see that they are lighter in color
they are definitely softer and less thick.
it seems more improved than the other.
my left check for sure has improved more than the right
i wonder if that means the product works better on less severe scars?
i sometimes wonder if results would be better without the mosturizer?
the area is so much smoother
the texture is more even
i can expect even more results
my skin looks better already
you're using too much
it is rather expensive
it might make you break out a little
frustrated that this little tube was all i needed in the end
my skin turned much much better than before
so far i do see satisfying results
a little goes a long way
don't need very much at all to cover area.
think i am actually getting better results with this serum
've tried lots of products to get rid of those scars with not much change
not only do my scars look flatter
it is working on my scar better than i had hoped
if you want to help those scars clear up faster
had used too much of it to return
i am amazed that more than half of the dark spots are gone
for my other scars as well
they are a lot worse than the one under my eye
so far this is the only thing that i have seen results on my acne scars
i can already tell that my skin looks smoother
just like every other younger person
my acne is just on a much lower scale.
i wouldn't uses them on current blemishes because it seems to make them bigger
other than than it's amazing.
i've seen great results so far.
the little scars seem to add up fast in those areas
this product actually helped get me to a point where i felt more comfortable without makeup on
they have lightened quicker than i thought.
a little bit of concealer my skin looks wayyyy better now than it did in high school
my skin always had small little bumps under the skin
i can tell the difference on my skin much smoother
fine lines are definitely better
in the beginning i wasn't sure it was having any affect -- my skin was still bumpy
even my boyfriend has commented on how much softer it is
it's also brighter and more even.
the reason i'm giving this 4 instead of 5 stars is i want it to do a little more for my wrinkles
while it hasn't made them any lighter
it's more than enough
my makeup even goes on better
not as bad as usual
my skin looks better than it has in 15 years
just wish the bottle/tube was bigger.
buuuuuttttt as strange as it can seems
i'd gladly repurchase in a heartbeat considering how much i've spent on my skin thus far
it is becoming smoother each time i use this
then everything got better
so had to space it out more
this has made my skin look better than ever.
with time i hope more
so maybe about a week
even though sometimes they hurt my pocketbook
have it go a very long way
my face feels so much smoother than my 53 years
my face got a little flakey for the first week
now all is well
it is much richer
so far, so good.
the texture is now a lot more even
i would definitely pay a little bit more for kate
maybe lighter fine lines
it was well worth looking like a little dry for a couple days
thinking the retinol would be too strong
it actually changed my skin in a matter of weeks
i do think it has slightly reduced my smile lines
i actually think i've had fewer breakouts this month
either they make my skin break out worse or they are too heavy
this is a lot more than i would usually spend
i used just a little bit more each time.
would have given it 5 stars if it cost less.
it's clearer than ever
a lot more even in tone
the acne gets worse
my skin is looking so much better than it has in years
it has so much better ingredients
my makeup went on much smoother when i was using this
i wouldn't use it at night time personally because i prefer something heavier at night
so far....i like it!
just don't use it as often as the directions state if you are having too much redness
my face already looks smoother
retinol has always been the way to go.
my skin has been smooth and overall looks better.
the makeup stays on longer
i felt like it was doing more than just priming my skin
even though it's a bit expensive it lasts me 7 to 8 months
a little goes a long way.
my oil production has been a bit less
tend to use just a tiny bit more than i would normally use to cover my face
smoother skin and a more even skin tone.
my face feels a little tight after i put it on
it helps even more with treating your skin
a little goes a long way
actually like it now
for winter, this may be too light.
when i first put it on it is a bit much sometimes
over time the smell seemed to get better.
it makes my face look brighter and smoother.
it is a bit pricey for me though
it matches my skin needs better as of now
i almost didn't buy it because it was a little expensive for me
it works so well
the most important thing was that my oily skin was nowhere near as bad as it has been
it's just so expensive for the little amount that you actually get
if they made it a little bigger
even more so than when i was a teenager
a little goes a long way
a little bit goes a long way
this may be a bit too light for you
so far its been great!
it has not been helping with my dark spots/acne scars as much as i hoped
which usually makes the process much longer
i do see an improvement so far
i think this might have even helped me clear my skin a little bit
i do wish that it was slightly less expensive
it does work so far
my makeup is lasting longer
my skin looks noticeably better
i do actually believe that this made my pores look smaller
my pores have not gotten any larger!
so far no new ones
you are hesitant to keep buying it so often because it last you a very short time
also, a little goes a long way.
a little goes a long way so you don't have to apply too much just a thin layer to cover your face
my skin has been looking so much better
use a bit more as to fill them in
so far so good.
just started getting into serums more.
i do notice less oil production on my face as for my pores not much of a difference at least one that i have seen
feels so much smoother
people keep telling me i look so much younger
while i still have a few breakouts they seem to heal faster than before
results get better with time
it has helped with my pore a bit as well
i guess i should settle for what i've gotten thus far
your skin actually looks younger"
they are much better than before.
the only reason this got 4 stars instead of 5 is because it is soooo expensive
my pores have never looked better
found several that cost quite a bit less
it's actually considerably less-expensive than many other eye serums sold at sephora
makeup goes on better
it brightens that under eye area so much!
it is significantly better
but overall much better than i thought possible!
it's made me look much younger
a little goes a long way
a little improvement each day adds up fast
this has done more for keeping my eyes looking younger than any other product to date
it helped me look much younger than 49
burns if used too much
so far i'm loving this product.
so far i love everything from this brand.
not helped a lot on that area
love this product so far
loved it so much i closed my eyes
i wish it de-puffed a little better
the area a bit firmer
the skin there appears much smoother.
it's been great so far
not as much i had hoped
whilst i liked it i wondered what more could i do- this combination is the more
a little does go a long way
it is pricey, but a little goes a long way.
it wears well under makeup, too.
while i do think it is a bit expensive
can dab only as much as i need
takes a minute to absorb so you have to wait a little before applying anything else such as makeup
bought this after long to long hours of research i liked that it was in a dark bottle with a pump i am 25 with porcelain dry skin that skin type shows aging way faster then others yay me
maybe every other day
a little goes a long way
they are not any worse
a lot of products actually make my eyes look worse
because the same product for face was too harsh for me
at least this seems to help slow it down
it is expensive but a little goes a long way.
just keep thinking there may be something better
it's true that a little goes a long way with this product
a little goes a long way so the products last a long time making it more cost effective than you would think
hyper -pigmentation much much lighter
eventually you'll see smoother fresher skin come through
it made them so smooth
my eyes have never looked better
no more looking tired even though i feel tired!
this one is better than many
it also just makes my eyes look brighter
unlike so many eye treatments i've tried
as i could see how it might be too drying for some
using this made me realize how much better it could be
every time i walk past a mirror i'm constantly surprised how lighter my dark circles look now
still have so much left
with very little cream you cover a lot
my eye area looks much better after using this religiously almost every night
the best part is: it's way less expensive than any of the above
he was even shocked at how much things firmed up compared to the other eye that had nothing on it
there are places where you could better spend your money
what more to ask for ?
hope you love the eye cream as much as i do!
love this little product.
so far i really like this product.
that's more than most products
way less expensive than the other br
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way with this eye cream!
using this even for just a few days made my skin so much brighter
my dark circles are nuch lighter no longer looking like brises
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way
i notice everyday they look a little lighter.
not much for brighten
a little goes a long way.
this has even made my makeup application much more smoother
a little bit goes a long way
no more fine lines as well!
so far the product has been amazing i'm already seeing the difference
no more dark under eyes!
you only need to tap this product because a little goes a looong way
little goes a loooong way
a little does a long way with this
it saves so much time too
just remember: a little goes a long way!
it makes the skin look brighter too
so for me to say that it made that much of a difference in my skin goes a long way
so you have to be a little more careful when squeezing it out onto your h
i tried so many things
truly thought it would be more expensive
the elasticity has gotten a lot better
a lot goes a long way so you don't need much
you get a decent amount for the price too
kinda thinner than expected
this is too much for my combo skin in the summer
feel so much better
it absorbs better that other things i've tried
i only use very small amounts because a little goes a long way
it lasts much longer than i would have anticipated with as much as i use it
a little bit goes long way
s when i need a little extra boost
much better then oil version.
a little goes a long way
i just wish the price was a little better or you got more for what you pay for it
wanted something easier to pack or carry in a purse
it has some healing benefits too
note; a little goes long ways!
i'll take better care of it just cause i need this
a little goes a loooong way
it goes a long way
a little goes a loong way too
too much for a morning moisturizer
this just seemed too greasy
so my fingers feel slightly greasy for a few minutes
it is more of an oil
even that sinks in quicker
i just wish it was either cheaper or a larger amount for $30 as it goes quick
so it was a no brainer.
it has taken me some time to figure out exactly how much i need to use on my face depending on if it's feeling exceptionally dry or not
is much easier than having an actual oil drip right off your fingers before you can even apply it
the only thing that slightly bothers me is it takes a while for the oil to be absorbed
a little goes a long way!
a little really does go a long way
the only thing about it is perhaps the scent is a little different
my skin is more even
my only complaint would be that it takes longer than my argan oil to sink in
four seems a little generous
a little bit goes a very long way!
i love this so much!
it really adds more moisture
it does go a long ways
i recommend this product even though its a little expensive
not cheap but a little goes a long way.
because if you use too much
the eye area was much smoother looking.
a little goes long way
this one is definitely lighter
this product lasts longer
it has not caused any break out so far
i could not be happier with it
a little goes a long way
been only using 2 weeks so far think works well my face looks smooth
changed my skin so much i looked younger
my face is so much softer/smoother
it seems better than i recall
i like it as much as chanel's lifting creme.
it is a little pricey
a little goes a long way
because it was a bit expensive i was still on the fence
this product helps make it more comfortable
my eyes have never looked better
they look less tired than they have looked in weeks
it takes very little to cover your eye area
my eyes are so much brighter and, tighter ...
you only need a little
a little goes a long way.
a little goes a long way
it even works on those deeper lines.
"we spend little on presentation
have more lines than i do
i definitely look more rested
fresher once i've used it
you just have to use a little of this as it is very concentrated
nothing except this one has made me notice any difference as far as darkness under my eyes
the area around my eyes already looks so much better
i think it's better than algenist!
stays an did not break me out my skin can be a little sensitive
my eyes look better than they have in years
better than i remember even in my 20's.
it looks really bad when i compare to friends my age or even much older
after coming to college it's only gotten worse between all-nighters
a little goes a long way so the price is definitely worth it in my opinion
so far i can really tell that my morning wrinkles has significantly reduced
so far so good
it may be helping with dark circles as well
so far no skin reaction to it
decided they were all pretty much the same
a little goes a long way and lasts all day.
a little bit goes a long way
great cream after one time use my eyes look much better
my eyes now look tighter
while the older intensive seem to just stay on the surface
it just keeps getting better
a little goes a long way so this little tube lasts me a long time
it does it so well
it feels a bit thick when you apply it initially
i found that using the 3-step moisturizer along with this is too much for my skin
this stuff has changed my skin for the better!
though in the summer i don't really need it much
oily places need a bit more attention
not as often because i feel bad about too much waste from used sheet masks
a little goes a long way
well i might as well just call it a day
and some nights are better than others.
yet i feel it absorbs a bit slow
a little goes a long way
they give a very generous amount in this sample u only need a little bit
my skin tone seems more even
a little goes a long way.
my skin feels as if it couldn't possibly absorb any more moisture
a little goes a long way
my skin did look better after using it for a few times
using this every night is a little bit much for my preferences
it still feels pretty full- maybe only 1/4-1/3 of the way used
it's just slightly thicker than what a regular moisturizer feels like
it made my skin feel so much better
a little lasts a long time.
i needed something to help it look fresher
so far, this works for me!
there's not much more help to be had at clinique's site
a little goes a long way.
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way
i only need a little bit of moisture in the morning
harder to find than you'd think
there is more than half of the container left
yet sometimes i forget that even if your face is oily it still needs a little boost now
it might be too much for your skin
the tube is lasting me a very long time.
so far i really do like it
a little also goes a long way
though it might feel a little bit oily when i wake up in the morning
the best part, a little goes a long way.
i love this mask so much
softer than it has felt in years
i leave it on much longer than the prescribed 20 minutes
it also seems to clean off my sink easier than the other br
is far less grainy- it applies very smoothly
it is definitely less so than the glamglow
it burns a little bit for me
i like to get more than 8 uses out of a product
it always looks clearer
a little tighter the next day
t isnt too expensive if you can get a lot of uses out of it
my skin just looks a feels so much better since i've started using it
even my dark spots look lighter
much nicer than the givenchy one that comes with their masques
using half the pod seems to work better for me
i’m not sure that using less than half the pod is really useful
more even toned from using it
each little pot of mask product is probably enough for 4-5 applications so the price really isn't that bad
so far so good
its a good, not too heavy, not too light cream.
i tend to leave it on longer
realized that it was so much
it does sting a little bit
if it wasn't so expensive
i love this so much.
the overall tone is much more even
do not leave it on your face for more than 10 minutes
my skin always looks more even
that could get messy
i also like this better than the boscia white mask
each little container has enough for 2-3 masks
i wish it were a little cheaper
it really helped them go away faster
went away way faster than normally
so a little goes a long way
it really works to make my skin clearer
my skin is much smoother
its so much better for your skin
but i do wish it was a little cheaper!!
a little goes a long way.
my skin looks much better
a little goes a long way as well
as far as clay masks go, this is as good as any.
just feels healthier overall
as mentioned it warms a little
getting rid of quite a few blackheads as well
only used one cup so far
i found that i used quite little of the product
i actually got 2 more uses out of it
get sooo much product
much easier than using my fingers to apply the mask
i actually think that it made it better
it has done so much for my skin when no other medicine could do so
a little product goes a long way
my skin just looks so much healthy overall
i love the pump too
i could see this being too much for people who don't have dry skin though like some of the negative reviews say
a little of this product goes a long way too.
then this product may feel too heavy because your not used to having a lot of product on
my skin feels a lot more smooth
it seems like it actually sinks in
maybe could have used more
a little of this goes a long way as well- i only need 1 pump to cover my entire face
a little goes such a long way
the pump cap will only get so much of the product out of the tube
i could actually feel how much product i had left in there
a little goes a long way
some of the other reviews said it was too thick.
they are clearly applying too much.
because a little goes a long way
yet it absorbs pretty quickly.
i definitely need something lighter for warmer nights
the price is right too!
maybe too much for summer use for the face
i still like it well enough
really like this so far.
my skin is softer and brighter than before.
sephora no longer carries it
my face was a lot less irritated
i like the tube form better than if it came in a pot too
probably haven't used it long enough
not heavy consistency too it
this may work better for normal to oily skin.
this product is not heavy what so ever
i usually take too much
although it is twice as much money
the pump is really cheaply made
so far it gives me more glowy healthy look rather than oily
it goes on well with makeup
i would use something stronger if i were going to be out in the sun all day
it is more expensive than drug store
i just wish it came in a bigger bottle.
my skin loves it so much
i've actually used this at night my skin likes it so much
i don't feel that it does anything more than my previous
was not too heavy on the wallet
i always wish things were less expensive
it actually has a pretty thin consistency which i like
a little goes a long way
increased my shine or just plain not worked
it is too heavy for me
i also think the price is good since a little goes a long way
i love that it is more natural, too.
it is a little bit thicker
since it's on the cheaper end
had no idea i'd end up loving it so much
this product actually feels more like a moisturizer
it's a little more liquid than usual moisturizers
i like this much better
i might not use it over the winter as it does seem a little thin
it has worked for me better than others i've tried
it goes on so smooth
always wished it had a higher spf
as far as any other positive qualities go
this oil is a little thicker consistency
if you need more you can add a little more
start sparingly as a little will go a long way
if you get too much on will take a while to sink in
a bottle of this lasts a really long time.
a little goes a long way
so far this has been great for my skin.
wish the packaging was a little more streamlined.
a little product goes a long way
thought i could buy something else that's heavier
this just makes my obsession even greater
also there isn't as much in there as you would like to think
i feel like the results are more similar to that you would get with night cream
i would certainly suggest this for a combination skin type in the warmer months
does go a long way
has actually helped to make my skin smoother
wish it came in a bigger jar.
it makes the foundation lasting longer
for lack of a better word
the cute little cubed jar lasted me a lot longer than i thought
if it was even more pricey i would still buy it
it cost a little more than drugstore versions
your paying for better ingredients that actually absorb
my complexion is more even
my foundation goes on more smooth
my skin tone is more even
seem to be reaping plenty of the benefits if you have the money
this product did so much more above my expectations
i usually leave it on for about 15 minutes or longer
no too heavy on the skin
a little goes a long way too.
oh and a little goes an extremely long way!
a little bit goes a very long way.
not too heavy but does the job.
needing less foundation than usual
this one by boscia is honestly so much better
so far, it seems very promising.
it has gotten rid of/reduced the few fine lines i did have
i've noticed the few breakouts i did have when i started using these products are going away quicker than ever
however nothing too bad
a little goes a long way.
couldn't be happier with the results
so much better to my skin than the josie br
so long story short
this hasn't made me break out even a little bit
which makes the cost a lot more palatable
which i love so much
unless i find something better
still just wanted something to achieve that all over youthful
if you're familiar with that then you should know that this is much lighter
i love it very much
i found my skin is much better in night than during the day
which was actually bigger than i had expected
this has helped so much
even though it was cooling
i like the tatcha oil better
works well as foundation primer too.
went with this instead cause there is twice as much
a little bit goes a long way as well.
a little bit goes a long way
you only need 1 or 2 drops mixed in with your moisturizer so while this product seems expensive it will last a ridiculously long time even with everyday use
unless i use too much
have tanned my face for way too many years
better than lotion or any other product i've tried so far
a little does go a long way so you will get your money's worth out of this product
it also felt more greasy on my skin.
this oil is a little less greasy
my make up applies better
you end up getting a lot of product compared to the usual 1 oz
i tend to get more oily later in the day
the only oil i have tried so far that i have liked better is the bobby brown oil which is more pricey with less product so this product is the #1 beauty oil i've found so far
plus, a little goes a long way!
i recommended to make this the absolute step because it does take just a tad bit longer to absorb compared to other serums
a little goes a long way.
a little goes a long way so the price point is great
this product feels a little heavy
a little goes a long way!!!
i love it that much
looks better every day
a little goes a long way.
a little goes a long way with this oil.
it makes my foundation apply much smoother
have always reacted badly with breakouts or little red bumps
do not put more than 1-2 drop though.
this should last forever since you use so little so the price point is very good
my skin just looks so much more clear
this oil is changing my skin for the better
a couple drops goes a long way.
i no longer get many pimples
i tried oils better
i loved this oil so much more
i feel like this bottle lasted me a lot longer then the fresh seaberry face oil as well
this is quite a lot of product considering how much you need for your face
loved it so much that i went out
haven't broken out so far
it makes even my fine
it is a little pricey
more even looking skin
makes my routine much more efficient
it pretty much fixed the problem
because it really is overrated/lackluster to me compared to these two
it's lighter than me josie oil
a little goes a long way.
has little to no scent
feel better than ever
a little goes a long way.
i love that it lathers up so much.
a little goes a long way with this product!
a little goes a long way
you need very little of the product
my face felt much cleaner
it can feel a bit heavy at times
because i love this product so much
have dried up so much
it is a little pricey
a little goes a long way
it's a bit over-priced for how much is in there
if it wasn't so expensive
my complexion was more even
i already feel a difference in my skin which looks fresher
if you use more
it will take too long to soak in
i like it when my skin is more normal
i know this was a bit long-winded
this takes care of it all day long
has been more normal since turning 34
the real difference is it is less red
a little goes a long way with this product
i used a sample of this rather than my usual moisturizer
a little goes a long way.
so only a little improvement on that end
for me, a little bit goes a long way.
have found that i need to use something thicker
it's in the 'get worse before it gets better' phase
something much needed right now
i feel like they are too expensive
i'd probably go for something thicker in the winter months
dont have to use as much for a light covering all over
only 4 stars because i wish it was in a bigger bottle for the price
a little goes a long way
because anything more makes my face feel greasy all day long
love the cream so much have just purchased the cleanser
a little bit goes a long way
i think it would be too little moisture for me on its own
this works even better for me
my skintone has become much more even in the month that i've been using this
so far i love it.
two downfalls are: product seems like it will run out on me in less than a month
i find that it works best if my skin is only slightly wet
however the scent is a little strong for me
it almost made it worse
one pump goes a long way
i prefer this one, i think it cleans better.
made my skin much softer
a little goes a long way- just one pump
my skin has never looked healthier/better !
i can tell you the oil was more orange than red
this is one of the few things that works well for me
it only takes a little to go a long way
this reminds me so much of that
your skin will be more even toned
you might just want to put a little less on during the daytime
much more reasonably priced
i would probably not recommend it for those with lighter skin tones
i only used this at night though because i found it to be a little heavy
although there are alternatives for dry skin that are probably cheaper
a little goes a long way
that goes away rather quickly
my skin instantly feels much softer
much faster after the initial new-product-breakout time
much faster as well
much less put straight oil on my face
my skin has never been better
my skin is better everyday because of it.
than the job it does .
diminishes red spots much quicker
my skin seems more balanced
it makes my morning routine so much more enjoyable
i really do think it makes a difference in making your completion look more even as far as redness
i still get little breakouts here
so overall something that works this well
it looked even more youthful
now i just use a little bit of this every night
much better actually than the pure rosehip seed oil i'd been using
i like the results that much
this product makes it so much more refreshed
my fair skin tone is more even
a little goes a long way
needs a little bit of a kick of moisture
just a little bit of blush
my skin has improved so much
probably due to the fact i never get more than 6 hours sleep
my skin is more glowing and even.
a little bit of serum goes a long way!
just that little bit over 2 days made my skin happy
it just keeps getting better
this one has really made that much more of a difference
might be a bit heavy
not as much as their eye cream
i figured this would be a good lighter-weight eye cream to try
that my fine lines are no longer an issue
a little on the pricey side though which is why i gave it 4 stars
poke the packet with a pin in the corner so you have better control on how much comes out
you can try it a little longer before buying.
it helps my make-up go on more smoothly.
so far it hasn't
a little goes a long way
sure it's more expensive
this is better than most.
gets even better with use
it only takes a little
my eyes seem larger since i have been using it
the darkness is still there a little
you only need a little bit like 1/4 of a full pump for both eyes
it seems to make the whites of my eyes a little brighter
a little on the pricey side
a little goes a very long way
i would say my dark circles are literally 85 percent better
it goes on so much smoother
it seems to also help somewhat with those-- maybe more as time goes on since i've only had it for 5 days
this is producing better reusults than i had expected
a little goes a long way- economical.
although i have only tried it once i can slightly tell that it gave me some color which is very natural
the only downfall is that it's a little expensive
this formula is much better!
i am taking off just one star because the smell probably could be a little better
need a bit more moisture than the pad version
i just need to save a bit before actually buying it
it has made my face look so much brighter
feel so much smoother
is sworn to be better than the expensive counterpart
so far so good.
my face is looking better by the day.
better looking my skin is
my skin has never looked so bright and even.
so far, it's been a pleasant experience.
a little goes a long way
no longer smell it
my skin looks a lot better
after the bottle gets to a little less then half way it just stops working
it's pretty but it lasts a long time.
a little goes a long way
my skin is more even
so far haven't seen much of a difference
that you should take care of it better than anything
no more mens lines for me
sometimes at night too
even though it is light weight a little goes a long way
just a little product goes a long way
love this product so much!
i learned that a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way
i really can't say much as far as energy boosting i've only been testing this product for a week
i've noticed that my face feels so much better
much better for the price
i love that so much
it never feels heavy
how well it works
it takes such a small amount too that i can feel good about the price
was a little nervous about changing what i currently use
a little goes a long way
a little goes a really long way!
this will last me a while since a little product goes a long way
've found myself still reaching for that
i love it so much!
a little goes a long way
more of a fuller cream if that makes sense
a little goes a long way with it
my skin looks more even under makeup
little bit goes a long way
a little goes a long way too!
a little goes a long way
i also love how a little goes a long way.
is so lightweight yet it gets the job done
its not too heavy
i think it's more of a matter of getting used to something different
it goes on well
i do notice that my skin looks lighter
reliable go-to for someone like me who struggles with dull
it was actually better than i expected.
my skin is not needing as much moisture as usual
it did a little better with powder but not much.
deeper wrinkles around my mouth it did not help much
i only wish it was less expensive
or there were more product
prevent from deeper ones coming
i find myself reaching for this no matter how much time i have to put my makeup
this is by far
my makeup staying longer
it also helps with making pores smaller although i don't really have any
this primer is one i continue to buy even if the price tag is a little steeper than other primers
i look so much better when i use this that i very rarely ever use any actual foundation
it works much better with those products that much i can say
even eyebrows do better, l use dipbrow.
only a little bit is needed
mainly because when i put it on i feel like i'm doing more for my skin than just prepping it for make up
a little goes a long way
my pores have never looked better!!!
i may be a little younger than the target market for this primer
a little goes a long way
like some primers that look worse as the day goes on
a little goes a long way.
only if under special condition that you might need a little more oil-control/silky finish
in my opinion better than hourglass
this performs better than lancome
something that i have struggled to find in a primer
made my foundation even
my makeup looks so much better with this under it
my skin looks better now that i have been using this product
it did not make my makeup last any longer than any other primer
better than putting makeup on bare skin
this product is so much more than i had hoped for i am in awe of algenist
i break out much less
my make up generally stays put
thus the 4 stars rather than 5
keep your makeup on longer
while i have found some that work pretty well this one is the best so far
so far, so good.
so far skin is softer after application
the texture was better than my skin alone
i like it so far
it was $30 for less than 1/2 oz
i tried to put a little less on thinking i had maybe applied too much
it does smooth them so that they don't become too noticeable
i think applying too much might have broken me out
don't use too much at one time otherwise i think it'd be a tad greasy
my skin tone is more even
the price is a little more than i like to spend
there is a lot of ways to buy this product much much cheaper
admittedly this is not something i would ever buy because at 28 i am not old enough to be spending top dollar on wrinkle reduction products
i'd try more of the products if they were a little more affordable
the results i notice are much more even skin tone
so far no trouble with the dispenser
not only was my skin firmer
plus for the price point i would like to see how much product is left
my skin looks a million times better
my skin has never looked better
i feel as if my skin has improved a lot since using this product
my skin just has a better texture
skin does feel smoother though no "miracles"
i can really see the results in the quality of my skin so far
so far it seems very promising
i often skip even light coverage foundation because my skin looks great these days without it
i've revamped my skin care routine more generally
you really need to use a retinol for 3-4 months to see deeper results
everything was just smoother all around.
hasn't done much yet for my larger wrinkles
has my skin appeared better i don't think so
felt my skin got worse after
a little of this goes a long way
gives a much smoother appearance
this product made more of a difference
many times during the day too
i must say that my face feels softer
some may find this a bit pricey
there is some minor improvement so perhaps it just takes a little longer
the longer i'm using it
the more the h
a little oilier then i like
my skin-tone became much more uniform
a bit pricey, but it works well.
it's easier on the skin than retin a
i think my face looks better now without makeup than with
this is far better
just made my late 30s skin look a bit better
a little advanced in age
still come out better
people think i'm much younger!
made my skin so much smoother and softer!
the longer i use it
just keeps getting better
i can also see more even skin tone.
which lasted a little longer for me
could not be happier
may be expecting too much
in the morning my skin looked much more even
as far as fine lines/wrinkles
using this product for the past month has just made my good skin look so much better
has been clearer than ever
know that a little goes a long way
skin tone is more even
after 3 days my skin has never looked better
$90 for 1 ounce is too much.
even the texture is better.
eventually most retinol products actually make breakouts better
you don't need much--just a little bit will smooth over your entire face
my skin has been so much happier since i started to use this
i still have some bad days
not too light, not to heavy!
makes me wan to try more of the korres line
a lot of higher end skin products haven't worked for me
although i love all of them so much
this made it so smooth
i don't use it as much now that i'm off the medicine
smoother than it's ever been
it does sting a little in the beginning
start looking better over all
i feel like my complexion is noticably better in the morning
i know this is a little pricey
could be a little longer-lasting
the smell might be too strong for someone
better than any moisturizer i've ever tried.
the smell is perhaps slightly yogurty
i'll probably use it more often
i've literally tried them all even the really expensive ones
after trying too many night creams i finally found one i love
when i put my makeup over my face in the morning i used less foundation i didnt use much of it a little went a long way
after using it for a while i guess my skin got use it or got better as i didnt see noticeable difference
which i guess is the intent better skin the only downside for me was the scent it wasnt bad just a little stronger than i'd like to fall asleep in as i have asthma it was a bit irritating at times
maybe i was expecting too much
too much for my combo skin
the smell might be too much for some people
feels better in the morning than when i don't use it
this is just too much
it is a great way to get a little extra "oomph" while sleeping
don't get much for your money
a little goes a long way
it was too much
have to say that i am enjoying that one more
t's kinda cools my skin a very little goes a long way too so do use too much
my acne prone skin is getting better
i could feel it about to start getting bigger
even that isn't very much
with very little expectations
this helps tame a lot of this without making me breakout
had little to no expectations from this product
i need more time to have an opinion on that.
so far so good
that i've been using all over my body too like h
i feel more comfortable without any foundation at all
using this oil nightly has helped my makeup go on much more smoothly during the day since my skin is no longer flakey
but it is a bit pricey for an oil.
have done too much
then went really far out there
even though i want to do more to try to get rid of some congested spots
instead make my skin better
i think i applied too much
half that would be pretty far in the future
it can be too strong for some
my skin looks better than ever it is smooth
i swear my skin is aging faster than i am.
not the only shrink your pores it also helps your skin look brighter more even
you only need a little bit
my skin has never looked better!
a little goes a long way.
a little of this product goes a long way
i experience far fewer breakouts
would be nice if it was a little more inexpensive
it's changed my skin for the better
a little goes a long way so that's one way to stretch your investment
for skin that needs just a little extra
not a whole lot of extra
it is too much
works better than either alone
they just better not discontinue
literally overnight my skin looked so much better
even better than before i tried this
i only gave it 4 stars because it's so expensive
it is pricey but a little goes a long way.
it was definitely worth paying a little bit more than you would for other popular br
it is a little sticky if you use too much
a little goes a long way.
my face has never felt or looked better
i've actually bought this product more than once.
it's really rich so a little goes a long way.
a little bit goes a long way with this.
while i like the product quite a bit
a little goes a long way with this product
started taking my skin care routine a little more seriously when started seeing early signs of fine lines
it is a little expensive
makes it feel tighter
it has also made my face look younger as well.
a little goes a long way
it's light and a little goes a long way.
a little bit goes a long way
the 30 spf was even better.
has made my skin better
this product gives a little light
wide for a moisturizer that actually makes my skin look better instantly
now that i'm getting older
has more than 15 spf without luck until now
it is so light
if you are too
takes cares of the little bit of tightening still needed after applying the other products
for lack of a better word
a little goes a long way
so the jar will last much longer than you'd think by looking at it
as far as more benefits…
my skin looks much better since i started using it
i feel my skin is much more velvety now
would give it a 5, but it is a little pricey.
as long as i don't use too much
so this is much needed during the day
would love to get the bigger size if only it was a little cheaper
i also feel that it makes putting on my makeup so much smoother
my skin looks flawless after using this which makes my makeup look a million times better
a little goes a long way
a bit more youthful after a month
by would be nice if spf were even higher.
it's very easy to use too much
alittle does go a long way.
a little goes a long way
however, i been using it quite a lot.
i wish it gave me a bit more moisture
a little goes a long way.
i believe it will be a bit too heavy for me in the summertime
don't need to use very much
the more i try perricone products the more i love them
a little pricey but a little goes a long way.
for some reason when i tried it in store it seemed heavier
just remember a little goes a long way!
may try more since this experience has been so good
i feel as i've gotten older i need something with more spf
my skin looks smoother and more even-toned.
it goes well under my makeup
plenty more as time went on
my skin looks easily 15 years younger
a dropperful is more than ample for my face
it pumps out the 'perfect amount' which seemed to be a lot
feels so much better
my skin looked better after the very first day
now because it is heavier i only use it at night
t falls over every time something even breathes too close to it
my skin not only looks younger
it is far more even toned
a little goes such a long way.
i swear on my life, they faded so so so much.
way better then anything from clarins had done for me
my skin looks healthier than ever
a little bit goes a super long way
it works over time as well
my skin has never looked better.
wait a little bit before putting on the moisturizer
a little goes a long way.
a little bit is able to smooth out over the entire face
it always contain so much wrapping
cut it to half for the day to make it last a little longer
a little does go a long way
i like it so far
it is on the pricy side of what i normally spend
which is even more expensive
my skin looks better than before
a little goes a long way.
several people have said they thought i looked much younger
even have gone as far as saying i have a "baby face"
even though it is really expensive
after just one use i felt better about my skin without make up
i only wish it was a little less expensive!
tend to look a bit younger than my age
since i've began using this product i know longer have to worry about either of those issues
my skin feels better
i just wish it was a little bit more affordable :
my skin is starting to look better
since it was a little pricey for my budget
the bigger bottles last me pretty long
feels firmer than before
could barely see them
within a week they pretty much completely disappeared
it just looks brighter, smoother, more perfected.
my skin looks so much smoother!
i think it works just as well as the eye version
i felt this one is absorbed faster
(anr is a little too "silicon" ).
anything else that goes after worked so much better
for me this is a better product than visionaire.
i still have a lot left
you only have use a little bit too so it lasts
soooo much more youthful
(plus, a little goes a long way)
seems to get worse with age
skin looks much, much better.
so could go through the bottle faster than anticipated
only after the first bottle i start to feel a little different
try this product out because it is every bit as good as they advertised it to be
my under eyes are looking better
my eyes looked bigger and younger.
today my makeup looked better around the eye area
a little goes a very long way
trying to find a better eye cream
the lines are so much less
it is super pricey but a little goes a long way.
you need very little
i think it helps to only use a little instead of a lot
a little is all you need
also just makes it brighter
the bottle lasts quite a while
it became a bit pricey
just generally looks healthier as though my circulation
i will appreciate tata harper`s products much more if they have no farnesol
a little goes a long way
i don't like to use too many products at once on my face because i can get oily fairly quickly from too much product
this mask truly did leave my skin brighter than before i used it
it makes my breakouts go away faster
i very much enjoy using this mask.
feel better after using
a tad bit goes a long way
it still seems to have the same effect
plus, all my old scarring is so much lighter.
got it in my may box and wasnt expecting much.
this was a bit more effective
all i had done differently was this mask
btw the more even a layer of this stuff is on your skin the better it works
how well it works
it seems more effective every time i use it.
my skin looks brighter already after only using it 2 times
a little goes a long way.
it lasts longer than i would have thought
i feel like it won't last very long even when using a small amount
it also helps to even the tone
a little goes a long way
on those days when you really need that extra oomph
a little does go a long way
this made me look like a baby -- not as much as the luna oil
it lasts a very long time since you only need a smidge
i've paid more for less
a little goes a long way.
so i will just try to mask often with this.
my skin looked much better than it typically looks in the morning
it made my oily skin feel much less so.
my skin has never looked better!
it was nothing too outl
next morning, bumps were much better.
i love this mask so much
sensitive skin that just want a little extra boost to brighten them up
my skin also feels much smoother, like porcelain.
i liked this way better than i thought i would
there are better masks
instead it shrunk my pores better than any other product i've tried
with a little oil in the summer
it's definitely more on the pricey side
or wait for something better value to come along
it goes a long way
i wish it was a bit heavier
it is a little pricey
i find that a little goes a long way with this one
maybe this is closer for you to access
it has helped me so much
a little bit goes a long way
a little goes a long way.
only a little comes out at a time
actually makes your skin look smoother
then i get to use my clairsonic too for a deeper clean
scrubbed much too hard
the price tag is a little on the higher side
i do wish it was a little cheaper
my skin is so much more clear
makes your face so smooth in a such a short time
since using this my skin has been a lot better
my skin is so much softer
have tried everything including expensive treatments like lamer
it does make my skin look more even
i started to think more
ended up loving the products so much
so expensive, but i love it anyway.
it's way too expensive for what it is
i find that using it twice a day is a bit too much as it is grainy
i've noticed it getting more even toned
rather than the two suggested on the bottle
can be too much
am allowing a bit more time to see how the new system
i think my skin brightens a little after wash too
my skin has never been better
first-i do not need to find any more cleansers to love-especially expensive ones
high points: a little goes a long way
my skin actually looked a bit brighter after using it once
lasts a long time too.
i give it four stars because it is so expensive
i wish they would package it differently
just wish they made a smaller bottle for infrequent exfoliators
looked better than it has in quite awhile
'll stick to tata just a little longer
it does go a longer way
but wait, there's more.
my skin has never looked better.
it makes my skin look like i slept for hours longer than i did
i even look younger
a little goes a long way
no more than a couple of pumps are needed for a good amount of coverage
wanted something more natural
it's too expensive to use on my whole face
i just ordered more
i've gotten so many compliments since i started
works great and less expensive then pericones.
yes, it has a stronger scent than most serums.
after seeing how expensive it is
it is too much for a br
too bad the price is a little outthere
it's thicker than i expected
i've never seen her skin look better
always better for the camera
like it very much.
since adding this to my normal routine i notice that that other items seem more effective
i don't know if this is from this product or from getting better sleep or a combination
easy to use too, packs a punch for the cost too.
i like this very much.
my bumps on face feel a lot smoother too.
this little tube actually contains quite a lot of product
feel so much better
for the most part this is above average as far as help with puffy eyes
it did very little
hoping for better results
could not be happier with the results
a little bit goes a long way
you definitely have to use it twice a day in order to see results faster
it's too early to tell if it has lightened my skin though
slightly smoother than before application
my skin tone was a little more even
my skin tone is more even
a little goes a very long way
i just wish that the effects lasted longer.
spending so much time in the sun
perhaps i'm being too quick to judge
a bit goes a long way
i've found it better to use at night for me
when first applied it feels a little heavy/ greasy to me
i wouldn't recommended it for the summertime though because it way too light
however after applying it left my skin quite shiny so my make up wouldn't stay on for as long as it usually would
my skin has never looked better.
because there's still so much product left in the bottle
a lot goes a long way!
although it's on the expensive side i've had it over a month
so far it's great!
i honestly use a tiny bit of genius cream as i feel this helps it that i don't need nearly as much as i did with other heavier moisturizers that broke me out
fine lines are looking better
my skin tone is more even
i suppose i'm a grass is greener on the other side kind of person
a little goes a long way
the pricier ones do work better for me
more mileage out of the bottle?
my skin felt a 100x better
my skin was looking better than ever
it's much lighter than even "light" argon oil
plus, it lasts a really long time.
but it's more than that description.
more color to my face
i realized that i was using too much after about a week
do not apply more than a few drops
my skin is looking good so far
it helps it go on smoother
there are similar or better products out here doing the same thing
this helped so much
seems pricey, but a little goes a looooong way!
that was a huge surprise i thought it would make it worse
i tried this after falling in love with josie maran to try to find something even better
it lasts so long
just irritated my skin more
it did not get worse though
asked my why my face looks so much better
i liked the algenist better
just much better appearance in general
no success so far.
have pretty much tried all the oils out there
i will say a little goes a long way.
the price still deters me a little
it feels lighter than most oils
my skin is so much better since i started doing this
or whenever my skin needs a little more moisture
as i have gotten older these kits seem to do more damage than good
it started to get a little better
it works better than any other product i have tried
the tone is more even
my skin has never looked better.
a little goes a long way
my skin is smoother than it's been in a long time
a little goes a long way
continue to get even better
there's just an overall much more healthy youthful look
don't tend to see much improvement with products
it's lasting me such a long time because i only need about five drops for my entire face
i love this a lot more than the josie moran one
as this sinks in more
face cream just makes my skin worse
as a lot of people are concerned about with oils
the pump on bottle works better than any other i've ever seen
i am no longer searching for a better skin care product
my skin just looks better
this is so light
maybe i sometimes put abit too much
it helped my skin so much
the little window shows how much you have left
there is a clear strip along the side that allows me to see just how much i've used
has a much softer look about it
i love it even more now
i will definitely buy this again- it is somewhat expensive
the bosnia is heavier and i like that at night
so far so good....
a little goes a long way
so far not crazy about this product
i feel like it makes my skin look a little more brighter
not only is my skin brighter
becoming even more irritated
this product is not just alittle pricey
i love this so much
i feel like i look a little more refreshed
i love how much skin is transforming
i feel my skin stronger
the formula just keeps getting better.
it helped even my skin.
may be a bit pricey
to be honest i'd rather buy this one
be careful not to use too much.
2-3 drops per night is more than enough.
a little goes a very long way.
feels so better in the morning when i use this
my hyper pigmentation was slightly better
it has seemed to clear up my skin a little
the longer i use it
texture-makes my skin look generally better
liking my skin so much more
figured my appearance couldn't get any worse these days
i feel more balanced
even though i've tried so many other products in between
got lighter as well
it even makes my skin more clear too.
your face immediately looks better.
they're more long term than being able to notice it right away
i've never struggled with more than a pimple here
was having a hard time adjusting
i don't see any changes to my face as far as timing
my skin feels so much softer
my skin has never felt better
the pumps were so much smaller
this product has made my skin have a more even skin tone
have been using this since college b/c my mom taught me that preventing skin damage is easier/better than repairing it
especially some of the better ones
helps so much with the texture of my skin
my skin looked better than it ever has.
my skin is much more brighter in the morning.
other than evening out my skintone i haven't found it doing much
90% of breakouts have gone away much faster.
now, i barely use any.
i wear it during the day too
my skin has been going through a bit of a rough time
will continue to do so for many more
i decided to give it a little help
my skin has never looked better.
i've gotten more compliments than ever before.
well worth it if you your skin needs a little help
i am not sure how much it helps with long term skin quality
i couldn't be happier
she says her skin feels so much softer/smoother when she is using this product in her regimen
i felt the need to try something geared more toward repairing
it works so well under makeup
my skin can still breath yet it helps to make my face much smoother
without makeup my skin already looks instantly better
even though it is quite pricey
the pores are a lot smaller then they were before
my skin looks better overall.
this definitely makes them look smaller
hopefully my pores can get better and better.
my skin never look better than when i have been faithful to estee lauder
much of that has to do with estee lauder
then switched to illuminating one which i love even more
the fragrance is just a little stronger than i usually like for a face product
it just keeps getting better
it looks more even
my make-up lasts much longer
cheeks looks so much better again
i couldn't be happier with my skin
my skin has never been so smooth even after a long day
a little goes a long way
my complexion is more balanced now too
going well so far!
spending way too much money
bought a second one because i liked it so much
wish i had discovered this sooner before i spent so much money trying other products
the smell takes a little getting used to in my opinion
that seems to get worse during the winter
i wish it came in a tube rather than a very heavy glass jar
i also had to learn that less is more.
a bit on the oily side so a little goes a long way
my makeup also looks better
i like that it has more skin benefits than simply
a little goes a long way.
so far not bad .
my skin has never looked better
especially since the 'you look much younger than your age' comments have started to become less frequent
in my 25 years of life i have never had better skin
acne scars have gotten a lot better
after about a week my skin does look a little better
it goes on so light
friends commented on how much better my skin had been looking lately
next morning after i used it my skin felt so much softer
liked it so much
my skin feels so much better
the texture is much smoother
the consistency is runnier/thinner than i thought it would be
it foams just a little
i could see the change in just about less than 2 months
a little goes a long way
it felt so rough
a very little goes a long way
people generally guess my age about 15 years younger than i am
as in she doesn't wear much for foundation
as far as its claims
can notice the skin around my eyes looks so much nicer
it's been okay so far
a bit on the pricey end for my taste
5 oz actually lasts a long time
it will last a long time because you don't use very much at a time
i can't even believe how much the discoloration has gotten better
skin feels much better.
i see the lines are less
at least my concealer goes on much smoother now
so far i like it better than my algenist eye cream
my dark circles are much lighter
i look so much younger
so most other creams just slide around
do not sleep as much as i would like during the week
plumper every time i use it
i would seriously pay much more for this.
this one is way better
a little bit goes a long way
so far i love it
it lasts foreverrr i'm still not done with it
it is so quick
my makeup even went on better.
this cleaner will last you a long time.
love it so much
my skin feels a lot smoother after use
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way!
my face looked so much brighter
a little goes a long way.
a little goes a long way.
it has helped my skin so much
it feels expensive too which is great!
i see that that her face looks fresher.
this has been much nicer on my skin
a little goes a long way.
feel less greasy during the day than before i started using this
my skin is now clearer than it ever has been before
it has helped clear up my skin in a little less than a week
works better than any other moisturizer i've tried
really like the lighter version
put the least amount of it as much as you can
a little goes a long way
my face stopped producing so much oil
my makeup stays on longer
feels like it gives my skin a little extra something
it is even better for my skin than the original
i love it so much.
a little goes a long way during the day or a good amount at bed time
there may be better out there
the regular formula was a bit too heavy for my skin
my skin is more combination
this helps so much with all my issues.
my skin has been so much clearer
i tried more than 3 drops
feels so much better
i fell absolutely in love with it that i had to go get the bigger size
never imagined an oil would work that well for oily skin
it lasts long because you don't need much
love this one just as much as the other josie maran argan oil
evoo although this is the first nicer
assuming its better than what i was using
i've noticed my skin texture is way better as well
so much better than the last oil i used
a little goes a long way.
so far i like this product.
a little goes a long way
i just felt better about using my high-end face
my skin is looking better than ever
am so ready for some better packaging
my skin's texture is more even.
so this stuff lasts way longer than a typical moisturizer
is so much softer
my skin has been better in every aspect
more even in tone
surprisingly enough this product decreased the amount of oil on my face throughout the day better than any primer i've tried so far
blending is so much more easier
less is more with this product
then too to make it look a bit more natural
can not even explain to you how many years i've been searching for something to tame my oily face
it works well under my makeup as long as i give it time to sink in
so far i really like this oil.
sometimes i used it to help get the last of my eye makeup off when my usual cleanser didn't quite get the job done
i will definitely look for a cheaper version
my skin looks so much better when i use this
which makes your make up application much smoother
love it so much!
a little goes a long way
at the same time it was just too much for my skin to h
it actually soaks in faster than i thought
love this so much!
every so often when money is tight
it has helped even out my skin tone
every so often i will double up for good measure.
my skin has been looking better
so far love it.
so far it's all been good.
my skin looks better then ever
so far, so good.
the texture took a little getting use to
what i notice the most though is definitely how firm
how light it is
i love it so far!
they felt a little harsh
not only got me washing my face more
caudalie better have this product around forever
love it so much.
doesn't perform any better than the cheaper br
i also love that very little needs to be used.
a little goes a long way
my skin is more even.
this is definitely my favourite toner so far!!
later i found out it smells better than others because it's so fresh
you may need a stronger cleanser to start
s of cleansing water as this it a little pricey too
i needed just a tad more to get my eye make-up off to feel clean
it is on the pricey side for what it is
you can make a little go a long way
it's much better than oil-based cleanser
this just makes my skin care regimen so much faster
the bottle lasts quite a while
a little goes a long way
but wait, there's more.
i seem to run out of it very quickly which is the only downfall
maybe it would work a little better for people whose skin is particularly finicky
i love this moisturizer so much.
maybe because is made with water
i would recommend this even though it's a little pricey
my face is so much more comfortable these days.
so far so good
you could definitely leave it on for a little bit
a little goes a very long way!
a little does go a long way
it really just doesn't get any better than this for a face mask
more than likely cause future acne or problem areas that you haven't envisioned ever having
i actually like this much better than just using honey or not even whipped honey
this might be too heavy
expensive, but lasts long.
a little goes a long way.
now i'm accustomed to the feeling
so far this works
the one thing i disliked is that it's so expensive for that little bottle
it is ever so slightly greasy
it made my skin so much oilier than it was
my skin looks so much better the next day.
i could not be more happier of my choice
it really helped my skin become more smooth
i've never looked more flawless in my life
and price is not as bad as most.
it's too much for my skin under makeup, though.
i still think i will switch back to something lighter in the summer months though
a little goes a long way.
i love this product so much that i went back
have yet to find one that i like more
i will go through many more
they were irritating my skin even more
as this can be a little greasy
even the more expensive ones don't do the job as well as this one
i love this moisturizer so much for many reasons
thought it a little thin
i works well all year long
i find the lotion is much more effective than the gel version
these are things that expensive creams have not done for me
i've gone through so many different moisturizers
i realized how much better this one is
now i feel like it has so much more elasticity
i've tried so many moisturizer in hopes to find one better than this
at times i'm more drier than usual
about as much as can be expected
less puffy pretty quickly
instead very typical average looking skin
a very little amount is more than enough
my eyes have never looked better
a little goes a long way.
as far as diminishing fine lines
dark circles go it is a little misleading
it was a bit harder to blend
as far as brightening goes
this does the best job of any so far at reducing lines
i do think that it might be for younger skin
when i say that it might be for younger skin
i feel that i need a bit more cream over it
mostly because i have very hard water where i live
the ibuki refining moisturizer in my opinion is better than this one
trying to find this has been harder than expected
a little bit of it goes a long way
i find that i need a little more moisture
i might try something a little thicker for the colder months
although it may be overpowering to some
a little goes a very long way
one pump is more than enough if not too much.
it's fairly rich so you only need a little
overall my skin does seem better than pre-shiseido
i could not be happier.
look like i have younger skin
my skin is looking better
however i found that it left my skin a little greasy
my skin is a lot smoother
this so far hasn't irritated my skin
i feel that my skin has become so much softer
feels significantly less congested than ever
my skin is so much softer and glowing.
my cheeks have become more
i much prefer this to the enriched version
the pump pushes out too much
i gave it four stars because i will need a stronger moisturizer for winter
it is the only one that keeps my face so consistently even
i still get break-outs that are so frustrating because i'm an adult
maybe a little hеavier than i wanted
so far so good!
i love how a little goes a long way
i like pump better
it has also made my skin a lot smoother
with this i don't mind it as much because it is so nourishing
a little goes a long way
rather nice compared to what i was using before
so far i really love it
just one pump is enough for the whole face
even with the harsh winter we have
the formula is lighter than i expected
there are many priced much higher than this one
a little goes a long way.
i see the results of my makeup gliding much smoother with it
it also hasn't made it worse
i've loved every shisheido product i've tried so far
at first i felt like i was paying so much for just a 2
a little goes a long way.
this moisturizer helped me so much!
albeit, it wasn't as bad as before.
how little of it you have to use
i liked this one better
to some this may seem a bit expensive
my skin looked a lot better after just one week.
my skin has improved so much!!
it has made it as flawless looking as it's been in as long as i can remember
you only need a little.
chemical peels that all seemed to do more harm then good
more with okay results
normally a lot of products hydrate too much for me
this bottle goes a long way
i don't see much difference in my skin as i use them now
but it hasn't gotten worse!
so much so that i will cut them in half
a little product goes a long way
maybe more effective if i used more often
i needed something mild
it stings a little when you put it on
cut the pads in half- i found them to still work quite well
this product has made my skin more clear than ever
so far so good with these pads.
my skin looks better than it has in years!
it wasn't too bad for me it just took some getting used too
when you use to for the first to weeks your skin actually gets worse
now i have no acne what so ever
wish they came in better packaging though
there is a bit of a burn
these are noticeably better
warning: it does sting a little
the more you use it the less it stings
i hope this helps more people!
yes it burns a little bit
burning after you apply may be a bit too much for some
it did continue for a little bit
started doing not much for me
i will admit it does have a little sting
this one is so much more effective than anything else i have used
i've never used another product that hurt worse
so far, they seem to be helping tremendously.
i would definitely be cautious if yours is as well
i'd say if you have mild to moderate acne i'd use these for a few weeks as a quick fix to clear things up then ditch them for something a little more gentle
return something that burns so badly
they also worked better than almost anything else i've ever tried
my skin has never looked better
it does sting a little but i find it tolerable.
now my skin is more even
this does itch a little bit when i first put it on
is well worth the trade off of not having big hard bumps on my face
they go away much quicker
thank you so much for saving my face
nothing was helping it
as i'd pretty much given up hope
better with less marking
like many others have said
it is already working- my skin looks clearer
it will get most of the job done
that seems to be effective enough for me
my skin looks much better than before
the body towels are so expensive for so few
then better plus i'd have to stick with it for a while to see some results
other than that i love it
i found that after a week or so, it stings less.
they do kind of burn a little
it is much more even
i feel like this product has given me a more even skin tone
it's been less than a week
i can't keep the product on for longer than 60 seconds
overall it might be worth the money if you can tolerate how much it stings
a little drying, but not too much.
they might even work better in time
which is slightly less than the recommended 10-15 days they suggest to see full results
it makes me breakout worse
it was getting to be a bit too much.
my face looks so much better
there's a purging period where your skin gets worse before it gets much better
plus it makes them last a little bit longer.
i like this product although it does sting quite a bit
this has been great so far in preventing new breakouts
a little goes along way!
there is nothing worked better than this one.
and pat on some more .
use very little amount.
you only use a little each time so a tub last a pretty long time
eve lom is far better
even better than my cpb cleansing cream oil
i’ve been getting far my compliments on my skin
this product goes a long way.
works well with a clarisonic too!
so much love for this product!
decided to take a chance even though it is expensive for a cleanser
in two days my skin has better texture
even my fine lines look better.
no more breakouts either
loved it even more
it takes so much time to massage my face entirely
i would have given 5 stars if it smelled better.
my skin has never looked better.
a little really goes a long way
even more expensive cleansers hanging around
as much as i dislike the smell
i enjoy this product very much
my skin looked tight which made my foundation look less than appealing on my face
i know it seems quite pricey
as i am getting older my skin seems to be getting more dry
just do it less there
this product is probably some of the better cleansing products i have used so far
eyes makes it even more aggravating
a little goes a long way for me
my skin has never looked better
as i've gotten older it's a bit drier
my skin looks much better
a little goes a long way
no longer breaking out
my skin is more even
i don't ever spend this much on cleanser so this was a stretch for me
a little goes a long way
it works out probably cheaper than others which i need to replace much more often
no more worrying about powder settling in to those fine lines
it is a lot cheaper
i just love it so much!!!
it is a bit of a process
goes a very long way
it did not dry out my skin over is it better than a 40 or 30 dollar cleaner?
my skin has never felt better
the eve lom is a slightly more inexpensive cleanser i may give a go
while this cleanser is expensive a little goes a long way
better than i was expecting
only a little dab needed each time so should last a while
they're smaller or gone
it also makes my pores so so so small
makes you breath better
makes the mask works better
i feel my skin got much brighter
a little goes a long way if you are worried about the cost
it is expensive but a little bit goes a long way.
be careful to only use a little because when you close the lid a little eeks out
a little squeeze can go a long way.
get no tight feeling
it looked so much smoother.
good skin only goes as far as the care that you are willing to put into it
a little goes a long way!
the smell seems less intense each time i use it
clearer than maybe ever
though you need so little with each use that i may just keep buying the little one
need i say more?
a little goes a long way.
so using it with verso's night cream in the same day is too much for my skin
the other reviews led me to spring for it even though it is quite expensive
even though it is expensive
so much that i sprung for the rest of the line.
seems cheaper than going to a derm
found out this product has spf 15 too
if i use just a tad too much a thick film is left behind that creates little balls when i rub my skin
just the right amount-which isn't much-works great though
i think my skin is more even
my skin is much more even
my skin seems tighter
a little goes a long way
a little seems to go a long way
not that i care so much
my skin has become much smoother
i've done good as far as wrinkles go
looks better than it has in years
my skin keeps getting better
the better my skin gets
the more i want to use
it hurts a little each time
probably has a better effect on my because of my age
a little seems to go a long way
this is best used at night because it can feel a little thick
more about how amazing the br
every day my skin looks better
i just look fresher
and i tried so many!
it does feel slightly stingy
the long term effects were decent
it appears brighter and more plump every day.
they are much more subtle
had pretty much given up
my eyes no longer have dark circles
so a 1 oz pump will last quite a while
what really keeps me coming back to this product after trying many other high-end eye creams is that it is the only product that works to diminish my under-eye circles
dark circles still seem there.
the pump feature puts out more than enough for both eyes
a little goes a long way
foundations are not settling into fine lines as much as in the past
so far so good i hope to see continued improvement
my eyes have never looked better
dark circles are much lighter
it works even better here.
well, this is a little miracle worker!
my skin is much much smoother
yes it stings somewhat
find that eye crems for that make my circles look worse
it goes a long way too
to my surprise it's far from the rest!!!
so far, i really like it.
it's more than enough for each eye
it did improve 3 little lines i have under my right eye
it is a bit expensive for what it does
a little does go a long
a little goes a long way
it is still less expensive than many eye products out there
about a 1/4 of a pump is enough for both eyes
even through the tough times
wish they had a stronger sun screen
however it can crease if it's used too heavily
i find a little goes a long way
a little bit goes a long way
probably better for younger skin.
didn't notice too much difference in dark circles
so one star less because of that
it does have a lot of benefits
a little bit goes a long way
so far so good.
let me tell you it should be much more hyped
this one is nicer than other ones i have tried
even the texture of my skin is much softer
the negatives: the price is a little steep considering you don't always get immediate results
i no longer look like i have rosacea.
it does not take very much product to provide coverage
or they got little bumps
use the product too much
am not accustom to spending so much on skin treatments
well...lancome has just changed that.
it's hard to spend that much on one product
even though i have dark skin
the rose hip seed oil should be no more than 15 bucks
i would repurchase just to see if my skin needed it a little longer
it lasts forever because only a little is needed
my skin looks much younger
this one acts better
faster than all others on the market
my skin tone got much better over all
works better on me
so non of them changes my skin color that much
i prefer the ending light glow of no 1 much better
they went away- it is too early to know how much change i will see
my overall impression thus far is that this product does what it is advertised to do
realized that my acne scars are really much better
my skin does look a lot better
and even better, my skin is glowing.
maybe not as severe though
i notice a more even skin tone
adding a moisturizer is too much
it totally made it lighter
cannot believe the results in as little as 2 weeks
even immediately after application your skin looks better
now all i see is even tone
i've gotten the compliments to prove it
a little goes a long way so the price is actually not too steep
is much more balanced
leaves it looking healthier than ever
a little goes a long way
that is more than enough to cover my face
it goes on a little "greasy"
a little goes a very long way
my skin looks better than it did before my big break-out
hard to say how much since i started using almost all new products
this does go on a bit heavy
i try not to put too much on the areas of my face that tend to get oilier
so a little goes a long way
i might try to find something a little lighter
so far love it
none work as well as this one.
love it so far.
expensive, but i have found nothing as good...
however not so much that i'll stop using the product
it feels a little greasy at first
it's far better than it was
both areas cleared so much
a little truly goes a long way since it gets very sudsy
it's so much better
so far, so good.
a little goes a long way
that pretty much sums it up.
it also makes my skin look much more heatly
a very little bit goes a long long way!
phthalates- a little goes a long way it is better value than any drugstore br
a little goes a very long way.
should last much much longer
a little goes a long way!
i need just a little bit of product to do the job
so the fact that is it quick
so far so good
this helps with that more than any other cleanser i've tried
a little bit more inexpensive would be preferable
a little goes a long way
this one was more gentle than the clarifying line
which is a bit rough
have skin with very little or no makeup on
because you need just a bit it lasts for a long
great deal at $35 as a little goes a long way!
appears to be helping to even out my skin tone
also, a little really goes a long way.
looks much more even
thought i wanted to try something less expensive
a little goes a long way
so far i think i like it better.
now that my skin is balanced out better
my acne has gotten better as well
even more so than with my normal cleanser -skyn icel
it goes a long way too.
a little goes a long way
which was apparently only making the situation worse
things have gotten a lot better
my skin looks even better now
price isn't too bad either as it lasts quite a while
you use so little and the results are huge.
clear it up would be too harsh
usually worse than i started off
i've noticed over time using it that my skin is also a fair bit more 'fair' than 'red' too
i shouldn't have to use a mask more than once a week
a little goes a long way.
i absolutely love this mask for when i've gotten a little too much sun or had a few too many drinks the night before
a little goes a long way so my sample is still going strong
love it so much, i just ordered more.
dillard's which i have wasted a lot of money on products that "claim" there is so many out here is just that
it is harder to find something that works as it claims for more mature skin
however it is a lot smaller than i thought it would be
the fact that it makes the redness go away much faster
great product--some of the other masks are too harsh for me
so far i love it
not make it worse
which it does well
skin better than it was before it had even begun peeling
i tend to get a dull complexion a little more quickly than others- this is awesome after exfoliation at night to fight that as well
i love this product so much
it does affect my rating a little bit
this is better then that
you can easily leave it on for an hour or more- i do see more of a result when i leave it on longer
a little goes a long way.
also a little goes a long way so you will have it for a long time
i love this so much
i did start to notice a healthier
plus a little goes a long way
it instantly feels much better
even better than some of the prescription medicines for me
to make it even better put it in the freezer for a little bit or just keep it in the fridge
after the first time of use my skin looked more even in tone than it ever has
so far anything that has irritated my skin has been helped by this mask
y for soothing the skin if i've gone a little too far with my acne products
i love this cleanser more than any other that i have ever tried
it takes a little getting used to not adding water
i knew deep down i was doing more harm to my dry skin than good
you only need a little bit
no matter how much i'm wearing
it does sting my eyes a little bit
a little goes a long way with
is a bit expensive though!
its lighter than a lot of other oils that i've tried
if i have too much out i just put it on my hair ends
if it wasn't so expensive
might be a smidgen more effective
a little goes a long way
as long as you don't use more than a couple drops
i also feel like that's causing me to use more than i should
a bit less than 1/4 of the dropper
sometimes somewhere in between or normal
since using it my skin tone has become more even
my skin just looks better over all
my skin has never felt better!
a little goes a long way
made my skin look much healthier.
it has helped my acne marks so much
there is no way to control how much comes out
but for how much it has helped me it will deal.
much better than some other oils
it's hard to control how much you squeeze out.
clearer than it has in a long time
so far it has worked wonders
"your skin looks so much clearer
even though this is a pure oil
as far as the packaging goes i have not had any problems
after i went in to find something a little stronger to help with winter dryness
softer than ever before
i wake up feeling so much better.
have to use it a bit longer before saying anything about the antiaging properties
so far so good
i love this product so much.
my pores seem to be getting smaller
already feel so much more hydrated
love how this oil absorbs so much more quickly than other oils i have tried
my skin has never looked better
and a little bit goes a long way!
a little goes a long way!
even then some of them can be quite harsh
it was that foundation that pushed me to find a better routine
it gives the most intense moisturization i have ever gotten from a product before
even though it's a slightly thicker formula
i find that i wake up with a more even skintone.
it feels like it might be heavy at first
also a little goes such a long way!
with one application my skin was already feeling so much better
a little goes a long way
i love this product so much
it was all over his poor little face
a little goes a long way
it no longer looks red
so far hasn't broken me out once
never spent this much on a moisturizer before
i used not that much amount
my skin has never looked better.
if i was younger this would be a better choice for me
it is on the more expensive side
a little goes a long way so be careful not to over-do it
a little goes a long way too
it makes your foundation look even better
i hardly wear foundation now
a little goes a long way!!!
have learned that a little goes a long way
it worked better than repair creams
more plump than it is without them
a little goes a surprisingly long way
though i thought it was weaker than the scent of the mask in this product line
you can actually feel your skin be more softer
this moisturizer has made my face look so much better
i mean that i've yet to meet a person who's skin flakes faster than mine
my face never been so smooth even make up is applying 100x better
making it look even more greasy
makeup went on better than before too~!
so i tried on my face too.
little goes a long way so even the small sample tube lasted me a whole week
i invested so much time
yet effective at helping my skin hold onto what little moisture it has
even though it clearly has fragrance
a little goes a long way
my face has never been clearer or more hydrated
the consistency is a little thicker than other moisturizers i've tried
this is a little lighter
i've gotten a lot of compliments on my skin since starting this regimen
it is very rich, so you only need a little bit.
i love this product so much
a little goes a long way
i felt like every product i used on my face the night before worked 10x better than normal
unlike some of other over-hyped
a little goes a long way--still on my first bottle even though i've been through a few tubes of the cream
i love it so much
my makeup goes on so much smoother on top of it
especially because of how much it comes with for the price
so be careful when you squeeze it out
it calmed down my skin so much
it would be too much.
i no longer look irritated
i honestly like this one far better than the creami find this more hydrating
my face has never been clearer or more hydrated
love it so much i just bought the gel cream too.
which is much thicker
it stays dewy pretty much all day long
there isn't much of a scent
it takes very little of both products to fully cover my face
my usual foundation looked so patchy on me
my skin was more even
the more moisture your skin gets the better
i notice my skin absorbs the products better now.
my skin has gotten much more plump
makes me look better rested than i actually am
ughhh i love this so much
a little goes a long way
look even toned like it never had before
it relieved my itchy skin last winter better than anything i've used
making it look better
my skin has never looked better!
a bit more for the neck
my make up looks so much better with it underneath
so far so good.
if necessary i might add a little of this after the moisturizer as well
my dry skin is better than ever
this one is a little gem.
does the job better than a $200 serumtotally inexpensive for what you get
healthy than it has been in quite awhile
the affected areas are generally a little rougher
s look much better after using this for a week
this is pricey but goes a long way.
a little goes a long way--i find that three drops is enough to cover my entire face
a little bit in the morning before makeup
now my skin is stronger
not heavy but stay longer.
i also love this product because you only need a little bit
need i say more?
looks better every time i useit
t's a no brainier for me
i am concerned about putting so many of such things on my face
it has just made my skin look more youthful
i found that a little goes a long way
i usually never use more than 1/2
most importantly, it really works!
etc my skin has been looking better than ever
my skin had an even tone as well.
was a bit hesitant because some of her other products were too intense for me
spend way too much on finding good products
i find that the less expensive more natural products that i prefer just don't cut it for me in the eye area
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way
it has taken me a long time to figure out what it likes
a little goes a long way!
this tube lasts a long time too
fyi a little goes a long way
a little dab goes a long way.
it also lathers up well so a little goes a long way
just simply tighter skin ?
have been using it pretty much everyday
a bit goes a long way !
i wish that the ibuki cleanser was a bit more potent
because it is closer to 5 stars than 4 stars
a little goes a long way
i like it it works better than the clairosonic it makes more foam
my skin seems to be better than ever.
i like it but not as much as the sample one.
my acne has been better since using it
you only need a little bit to get the job done
this one seems a lot nicer for my skin
it never feels more dry than right after i use this product
i every so often try something new
my skin is brighter and clearer than ever.
the best part is that you get a lot of product in the bottle because you use so little
it is costly, but a little bit goes a long way!
i've had trouble skin for as long as i can remember
my skin got more smooth
a very small amount is more than enough
i only need a little bit
a little goes a long way
still have 1/4 or little less left
my skin has never looked better!
a little truly goes a long way with this wash
a little goes a long ways
i liked the trial so much that i ordered a full size which should last a year or longer
just a little goes a super long way
when i use it with my clarisonic it's even better
a little goes quite a long ways
i can also see how it has helped to brighten dark spots
i love it so far!
even though i'm still not seeing much in the way of aging
a little works enough for my face and neck.
if i kept the cleanser on for too long
a little bit goes a long way!
i love this cleanser so much.
this is by far my favourite cleaner so far!
a little goes a long way
i get more compliments on my skin than anything else
then i remember how much less makeup i have to use daily
how much better my skin looks
a little bit of each goes a long way
a little goes a long way to a nice
a little bit goes a long way!
yes its difficult to rinse it off when you use too much
i've used so many big things
a little goes a long way it lathers up considerably so you don't have to use much
especially that a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way this will last you months
my face has no more dryness like it did
my face never looked better however i thought it was all cause of the clarisonic
it was still much better then before because of my new clarisonic
have never looked back my skin has never been better it's so much more clear
my makeup looks so much nicer
when i put the softener on its feels much better
i couldn't be happier
my skin has never been better!
is less oily by the end of the day than usual
this though- i feel like this is a much better night moisturizer than the mask
my face is pretty much clear now
a little goes a long way
that it is a little bit hard to even it out on the face
which is much thinner
there is nothing i love more than this moisturizer
it does it well
it is more of a cream texture rather than a gel
love it so far
shiseido does a better job of smoothing
it seems too watery in its consistency.
now that i'm getting older
felt that i could have even more moisture
they are much smaller
the surface of my face is more even in texture
as we move into the colder months it gets even dryer
at first i thought the fragrance might be a little much
it is just looking better and better!
this is the one i found so far that just won't make my skin break out at all
it would last a lot longer than it does for me
put too much it does get greasy
although i was worried that it might be too thick for summer
tends to break out more
my skin is still far from perfect
my skin is slowly getting better
it's more than enough to cover my entire face
because when i applied too much
i wish it was less expensive
hydrated for a longer period of time than their regular counterparts
i would much prefer a pump
a little goes a long way
my skin looks so much nicer
i do find it a little heavy for day time
i've found myself reaching for this one more frequently
i would not put too much on though
a little goes a long way
this is pretty much an all in one product
it's quite dense; just a small amount is needed.
my skin tone is more even now
a little goes a very long way
this moisturizer is a little heavier than the other with the pump
a little bit goes a long way
t's more bang for your buck than you may think
so far, so good.
enriched formula seems to be working much better on my skin than the regular formula
i couldn't be happier.
it always look brighter
my skin has never looked better!
seriously, my skin has never been better.
i felt like this line was meant for more mature skin- boy was i wrong
my skin looks so much better after using it
because it doesn't take very much
a very little goes a long way.
like my pores are looking a little better
soooo far it hasn't done much of that
i do like it so far
so far i am done with one container
you might want something heavier
my skin is looking much more smoother
a little goes a long way
after one jar it has gotten better
i may use something lighter in summer
i couldn't be happier with its results
no complaints so far
give it a try if your on the fence it's a lot better than others i've tried
definitely did not help too much to smooth out a complexion or reduce blemishes
i like it better the the skin care line.
i always wake up after using it at night with my face not even slightly greasy
my skin has never been better!
is less oily by the end of the day than usual
as far as the cream itself
so this may contri
ones i have spent a lot more money on
i never feel like i have paid too much for any of his products
makes my skin look more even and healthy.
you need a little bit
makeup goes on better
better in my opinion
because this is heavier than what i usually wear
my skin looks so so much better
bit pricey but little goes long way.
my overall skin tone is more even
my combination skin does look slightly better
i would consider it if i had more mature skin
it's a little too pricey for me
if i had more money or were a little older
it lasts for a long time as well
making the price seem slightly less outrageous
a little goes a long way.
my skin is beginning to look better.
the price tag is a little daunting
can't wait to see how my skin looks after a few more applications
a little goes a long way
this is much more of a balm than a traditional eye cream
i think this would work better for puffiness
a little does go a long way
which means makeup sits better
a little goes a long way.
the lines seem to be getting smoother
t just maybe this is a lighter texture than i am used to
a little goes a long way.
a little goes a long way
it is still way better than 99% of the other eye creams i have tried
not only do you have to use very little
which means i get more bang for my buck
a little goes a long way
you don't need to put too much
the price kept me away for awhile just seems so expensive
a little goes a long way
they seem to give me bumps on the lower skin around my eye
it keep getting better
masts a long time because you don't need much.
it's pricier than some
which was a struggle for me lately
i don't have too many problems maybe the start of some fine lines
it's better to start early
a little tiny bit goes a very long way with this one
a little will go a long way.
so this is a plus
now they are much tighter
all it takes is just a little dab for big results
blends much better as well
it does not settle in the fine lines like a heavier concealer might
have been focusing on more natural oil based ones lately
expensive eye cream but it last a long time.
so far so good :)
so this product could have very different effects on people with more wrinkles
i felt like i needed more
this cream has done a better job than others i have used
i hardly expected it to because mine are so bad
wrinkles are pretty much gone
a little goes a long way.
my skin has never looked better
also around my eyes too
masks- some are better than others
not really expecting much since nothing has worked
my skin tone is more even
i am now closer to 50 than 40
i felt that i needed a little something extra in my daily routine
loss of tone on my face were just too much for me
more healthy over all
some work a tad in due time.
overall my skin is just more glowy
if you are in need of better texture tone
you use very little
got much better results from the cream when i used this first
a little goes a long way
the price is a bit higher than most serums
the texture is a bit thicker so the products will last for quite some time
does seem to keep those fine lines from getting any deeper
its toooo expensive for how much is in the container
i literally have never had better skin- ever
my skin is much better toned
a little goes a long way.
the missing star is because i'd love to have a "plumper" in this cream as well
same results i got with much more expensive moisturizers
more often than not
i felt like a little goes a long way
i loved it so much that i had to buy it
it made my face feel super soft without having to apply too much
t's a little lighter on skin
for lack of a better word
'm frequently fighting those new little lines
better than it has in years
don't use too much
you don't need a lot of gel because i have learned the nuface works much better with less
once i got a better grip on how much i needed
just seems to be ridiculously easy to "use" far more than you need
i don't mind spending a little bit extra for a great product
a pump would work much better.
i think that the bottle would have lasted much longer
a little goes a long way
are really expensive or don't do much
much better than the other dozen or so moisturizers i've tried
this one is by far my favourite
it does not make me produce more oil
produces so much less oil
seems overall much calmer
figured i'd try this as well
changing my combination skin to something much more manageable
cheeks are much smoother with fewer lines after just a few weeks
smoother and even all over.
surprisingly the smaller size has already lasted me a little over a month
when i don't use my nuface i definitely start to sag more
you don't need very much of the product at all.
this combination has done sooo much
we love this so much that wevare slowing switching everything to just jurlique
a little goes a long way.
since i loved the previous one so much
just a little serum goes a long way :
you barely use any cause it is a thicker lotion so a little goes a very long way
much less than any other eye cream i've used
it was more than generous
hope the skin cream does as much as the eye cream has
i got a little cautious with the reviews as a lot of people claimed this product did not leave their skin moisturized or feeling good
just use something stronger for eyes
this product does the job and more.
little bit goes a long way.
i like this one even better
just wish it came in a bigger format!
even more so without any tight feeling
a little goes a long way
my skin texture is already better!
my skin was so much better
i love this so much!!
maybe even improve my skin
it also dries me up enough so that my t-zone is noticeably less oily throughout the day
side note: a little does go a long way
i've tried so many things
it dries my skin out too much
i do think that $28 is a little much for a cleanser when i can get a better cleanser for $19
so far so good.
i wear a full face pretty much every day
have to just deal with it a little
it took longer than expected to come in
it is much clearer now
something a bit stronger is required for that
good product so far!
this cleanser does so much more than i thought it would
so far my face has been slowly healing
it takes a bit more effort than others i've tried
how little i generally have to use
no more than five rubs?
i really like it so far
it was rather strong
also a little bit of mask goes a long way
has not broken out my more normal-skin areas
makes my skin feel so much softer
it is so much cheaper than the others i have used
feels a little greasy at first
looks so smooth now
a little goes a long way with this product
a little goes a long way
this sleeping mask has a very thick consistency so a little goes a long way
or if i just use a tiny bit it works as a moisturizer as well
except this one has a much better price
i can also tell my skin looks better.
so no worries there
i will definitely be buying more of this!
the formula is thick so a little goes a long way if you apply it thinly
a little does go a long way.
when i put this at night i wake up with my skin feeling much much better
a little goes a long way.
which while somewhat did its purpose it wasn't that amazing to me
my skin never looked better
i am still giving this product a 5star rating because of how much i love this
sometimes i've put on too much
it seems so heavy
no longer had to use it
if i go more than two days without this i can feel it
particularly to anyone whose skin needs a little extra love during cold months
more so as i age
package doesn't have much direction
i apply a very little at night
it almost seems to help even out my skin tone
and no more dark circles!
only getting drier as i get older
so far i like it
i don't notice this lasting more than the morning
had been a flaky mess for longer than the one month my derm suggested i would be
each day my skin is getting better
you don't need much, a little goes a long way.
i also noticed the rest of my beauty routine has gone better as a result
a little goes a long way.
i saw that my other products worked much better
lasts longer now that i am using it
don't use it more than 2x a week
i normally feel the effects of a mask for no longer than an hour or so after using it
become softer even after the first use
but the smell is too much for me.
it made my nails much stronger
a little goes a long way
so far i'm really liking it
i don't feel like it's better than this one
some days i wake up feeling like my pores are smaller too :
downside is this is not one of those "a little goes a long way" cream because it doesn't spread easily
you can notice how effective it is in a few days too
a little goes a long way
one from estee lauder no less
it was so thick that i had to use a lot of it to get an even layer on my face
how much needs to be used
possibly because it has gotten a bit colder recently
i think that it is probably too expensive for an everyday thing
i'll probably look for something less expensive when this runs out
it is a little on the heavy side
it goes a long way
can feel heavy if you use too much
i largely feel like i'm paying way more than i should be for what i need
this has been one of only a couple of things to work well
thank you so much for offering this at sephora.
my face never felt better
the more hydration the better.
this product feels a little richer
my skin tone is more even
my fine lines appear even finer
it is much more dry than a 20
having dark enough circles made me feel insecure because it had been pointed out several times
without even realizing it
which is much more expensive
i find that it does work slightly
it did help the texture a little
this did make my eyes look a bit brighter.
this did much better
still have a bit left
i've tried so many different under eye treatments for dark spots
instantly made my eyes look a million times better while making them look so bright
i will be trying more of this line.
never the less, circles are fading.
the way it looks now without any makeup at all is actually lighter than it used to look after i applied heavy concealer
it's a bit thicker than the ginzing one
i find it has better brightening effects than the ginzing one
which i hadn't noticed as much with the ginzing one
i like this much better than clinique "all about eyes" which did nothing for me after a year
it has only been a week of use so far
'm generally not well rested
i would imagine that this product will work even better for you
that a little goes a long way with this product
i've recently started devoting time to making it more naturally beautiful
best product i found so far for deep wrinkles.
my makeup during the day has even been staying better
a little goes a long way
this product actually makes my skin appear more smoother
after one month of use my mothers skin looked so much better
needless to say its made her feel better about herself as well
after using his skin brightening solution my make up goes on much better
not to heavy but gets the job done.
it makes my skin smoother than ever
i guess i will continue using this cream even though it is a little pricey for my budget
so far, this gets 4 stars.
i feel that it evens my skin tone slightly
so far so good
i do wish it lasted longer
this one is far
my skin already feels so much softer
to make this moisturizer even better
my makeup application has never been easier
was worried that this might be too much
has quite a bit of product
i love this product so much!
truly a little bit goes a long way
you don't need a lot just a little goes a long way
this was too heavy for me as a day cream
my skin tone is more even
maybe it is a little harsh for my eyes
with this moisturizer it looked way better
it seems to help even my skin tone
fo far i really like it as a face cream
they all have small effects-good or bad.
i don't need very much of it.
it was softer and even the pores seemed smaller.
after using two drops of oil a little of this cream goes a long way
this cleansed my combo skin so well without stripping it too much
haven't found anything that i like better!
makes my face more brighter
i still love it just as much as i did the first time i tried it
so far the benefits have outweighed this annoyance though
possibly with dark spots too
i just look younger
the results are too good to pass up!
each week, my skin looks better and less aging.
i last long and little go al very long way!
my skin just looks better all over
this is as close as i've come so far to something drastically improving my skin
ed to my skin looking better so quickly
this stuff is a little bit pricey
a little goes a long way so the jar will last a long time
old hyperpigmentation is fading so much faster
plus a little goes a long way.
i think it may even be lightweight enough for summer
so far has worked well for the end of winter
i just used a little less
a little goes a long way
after three days my skin is brighter fresher more even
i've noticed that i can get two applications out of one sample pack so a little goes a very long way
a little goes a long way
my skin is softer and looks better.
it goes a long way
so far this makes my skin look
actually less expensive than what i had been using
a bit more of a face-oil texture than the other algenist cream i tried
at first i thought the price was too expensive
don't wear very much make up
i actually still have quite a bit left even after using it for way over 10 days
i also think my skin is firmer
too much for my skin to layer under foundation
already i feel like they are diminishing
my skin has never looked better
i noticed after about a week how much brighter
feels better than ever
and did i mention a little goes a long way?
ended up ordering because i felt my skin looked much clearer
i found that one too harsh
sn't nearly as bad as people have said
i will be reaching for this peel more often
then it takes longer to dry if you put enough on which can make my skin burn a little
long story short, that didn't work out too well.
my face appeared much less oily after just one use
to have an easier time of peeling it i smile so that i have a good place to start
so far, i like this mask.
i found it a little bit difficult to peel the first time i used it
it seems work well for a teenager
have not seen him having serious breakout for quite some time
i feel a thicker later is easier to peel off
feels overall better on your face
everything looked more even
i will definitely be using this more often
i think it takes longer to to dry than it says
the mask is a little difficult to peel off at first
irritated than it usually is
next time i applied quite a bit more
it was enough to bring attention
i really like the results i got with this mask so far
which had plenty of product
this product is my go too when parts of my face feel slick or congested
just put on a bit more than a super-thin layer
now i'm buying it because i liked it so much
the price is a little high..
i really have nothing bad to say about this except it is a little expensive for a face mask
however i only gave it 4 stars because you have to use much more than the directions recommend in order to peel it off properly
my skin looks so much better
it gives me clearer skin the next day
except this is a million times better!
sometimes all these quick fix products out there just feel too fast
it became red and flaky and just got worse.
it was a little difficult to peel
i feel like it may be a product that gets easier to use with experience
my skin looks better
a little goes a long way
possibly better than after a treatment of exfolikate
it could get a bit messy
a little goes a long way as it foams up
the price isn't that bad because a little goes a long way
you don't need much because it spreads really well
i do get a lot more acne than when i was younger
my skin has never looked better!
my pores look much better since using it
while this product has not completely helped with it as much as others in the past
a tube lasts quite a long time
it was no big deal
it may be a little too drying then
and they heal much faster if i do get any.
so far so good!
i too have been using it and couldn't be happier.
the trick is to not use too much
i liked it so much
less pretty much everything
i just use a little only on the breakout to wash
ugh i thought was very dry however over the years it has become more combination
a little goes a long way !
i think it has helped manage usual breakouts as well
it tightens so bad
i tried so many
that one by far was amazing
a little goes a long way.
my face is much smoother than it was.
it still works wonders
it calmed down my face so much
i love this product so much
controls oil pretty well for a couple of hours afterwards
a little goes a long way.
after just one use some of my pimples were gone this product completely changed my skin for the better
my skin looks so much better
on top of that my skin was so sensitive i could hardly find or use any products that wouldn't making my skin even more red afterwards
much easier to tolerate than some of the dr
maybe use a little less
had little hopes for it
i spend a lot of $$$ trying out different masks
what is more brighten it too
skin was so much even
i just had too
a little goes along way which is great for these colder months
my skin is more even
so far i'm in love.
i've used this 3-ish times so far
the effects lasted pretty much all day
they are lightening up little by little
i like it so far
it might have even tightened my pores a bit.
if you press a bit harder you end up with a lot of product to use
which i love even more
already commented it looks better
it is less greasy than shiseido
so, you pay more but use less.
well, well, well worth the money so far!
not only is this great for women of more mature age
better than any product i have ever used.
this is wonderful since i have spent more $$ than i would like to think on products that were disappointing
so far i have only noticed a very small difference
that may take more time
also the puffiness seems a whole better
ever though it did last quite a long time
am often looking tired
i wanted them brighter so the product works
they seem to be minimized a little bit
it goes on light, but not too light.
it also definitely helps a little with dark circles over time
price tag hurts a little though.
it is a little pricey
it did take quite a while to see results
a little pricey but you get what you pay for.
my eyes look brighter and more firm too.
because it is more natural it takes longer for results
a little bit goes a long way!
this seems to make them lighter
still have some of it
i can clearly see how much this product helped
look no more ladies.
though it takes a little extra to work all the way into my burgeoning crows feet
this is the most effective eye cream i have tried so far
way better than the other products i tried
100% better than my arbonne one.
it lasts a really long time
can get a little more bang for my buck
loved it so much i had to go back
prefer this consistency 10x more than the light
a little bit goes such a long way!
that little jar will go a long way
my under eye area looks 100 times better!
i felt it was a little rich for my skin at the time
even if one seems to be doing well
a little goes a long way with this.
results are only getting better
as much as it pains me to need a product that is so expensive
i couldn't be happier with my choice.
you only need a little bit and goes on real easy.
although the pricing is a bit higher than the normal eye cream
a little bit goes a long way
everyone is talking about how this product is expensive
a little goes a long long long way
a little goes a long way
although it is a lot of money for just an eye cream
i don't want to give an expensive product so much credit
i never spend this much in one item
a little dab goes a long way
i've never spent so much money on a skin product
its very concentrated so a little goes a long way
while i haven't noticed if has or hasn't delayed aging or if my fine lines have started to go away one thing i can say is my dark circles under my eyes do appear lighter
generally make my eyes a little perkier
saw how expensive it is :
i need this too
i wish it was a little more affordable
i only need a very little
you need very little
i wish it was less expensive.
a little bit certainly goes a very long way
it also makes my eye seem brighter.
not only are my dark circles much lighter
actually helps me to look younger than i am
much more expensive cream
i know this seems a bit pricey
my skin has been horribly dry as far back as i can remember
this has also made my face makeup look much better
my skin has never looked better
feeling like i wasn't making much progress i ended reading about this product
they have gotten smaller
you only need very little with each application
leaves my skin softer than any expensive night cream/gel has been able to do yet
i love this product so much i just hate because it don't come in a bigger size
feels better than it has all winter
my skin looked so healthy only using it 3 times
things got worse in my 40's.
i used waaaaaaay too much
it seriously looks better than ever before
intentionally use too much
i loved this product so much i went
quite pricey though unfortunately.
i wanted more naturally
everything was just better
i mean much better
my skin is looking better everyday
not as much of as long as with an oil
the fine lines on my face look so much better in the morning
again for a bit more hydration
they need much bigger bottles.
unfortunately i stopped buying because it's just too expensive
so far my skin is a lot smoother
i like it because it is a little thicker than your average oil
i do notice its better when i am not in humidity
a little goes a long way.
this might be a bit heavy
i really didn't want to like this so much since it is on the more expensive side
ive tried probably 10 different ones since that have ruined my skin or haven't been effective at all
it's just too pricey considering how little product you get
my face looks looks alot better
regret not buying the bigger bottle!
i wish i had more
i guess you need a different more lightweight moisturizer in the summer
it made it so much easier for me to cover those things
i looked everywhere for a cheaper dupe
the moisture this gives me makes my foundation look a million times better too
a little goes a long way
i love it for that too
my skin still looks a little tired after use
a little goes a long way
it works way better for me not to
even if they are a bit pricey
it is a little pricey
my skin has never looked better
the price is steep, but a little goes a long way.
we had a very long
by far it has been the only product
feeling better than it had before using this
it did burn a little
a little goes a long way
it was a bit offputting because i was expecting something thicker
i left it on a lot longer than i originally intended just because it felt really nice on my skin
however not a very good mask as even after you leave it on
gg has it figured out better than most
i guess the price is more for quality than quantity
maybe it would work even better with more
i no longer have any "cake-y" foundation look
or even normal skin for a little pick me up
it looked like there was a little film on the top layer
a little goes a long way if used only in drier spots on the face
maybe after the winter months my skin will react better
a little goes a long way!
le that much without breaking out
i love this product too much.
i felt that my skin was more plump
it made my makeup look better, too.
i've never had so much hydration with any other "mask"
my make up applies so much smoother
if your skin is even just a little dry get this you won't be disappointed trust me a little goes a long way
a little can last long way
so you can use it for longer time than average moisturizer
a little goes along way
found myself using too much
my skin looks better than when i was in my 20's
so far so good
very little is needed for my entire face
even though it is pricey
a little goes a long way
have never come across a better night time cream
a little goes a long way
decided to take this as i was told be a better more richer
as we age different products work better or worse than others
almost immediately my skin looked better
it lasts a really long time.
yes, this is way expensive.
just a little goes a long way
i do like it very much
it's just a little too strong of a smell for my liking
got 2 really nice sized jars that i still have half or a bit more left of in each
getting more notice-able wrinkles such as crow's feet that were starting to just really bother me more
as well as those "smile lines
those lines/wrinkles are what i really most want improvements in as well as all over "toning
i like this one better because even though it is very thick it somehow feels lighter on my skin
no breakouts plus it lasts so long
will definitely buy more!
i couldn't be happier
a little goes a very long way
you are using far too much
i never have had so many compliments about how clear
a little of this product goes a long way
it goes a long way
i used a very little amount
it makes my skin look even smoother
overall my skin looks better
my fine lines are barely even there
the breakout was soooo much clearer in the morning
i'd go as far as saying "glowing"
no more dark spots
a little goes all over your face
no more dark spots
a little goes all over your face
a little does go a long way
maybe they're putting entirely too much on?
a little bit goes a long way
less is more with this concentrated formula
it love this one so far
it's also easy to use too much
although not as much as when applied over other products
a little goes a long way with this gem.
a little goes a long way
pretty much any product containing enough physical sun block will
even more i love that my makeup stays in place
cause i definitely don't need more of that
i love this so much.
so try not putting too much
a little will go a long way
a little goes a long way.
especially if you apply too much
might take a little more patting in than most eye creams
nothing else will ever be better at keeping wrinkles at bay
it it somewhat pricey but it is a good product.
my skin tone is more even
a little goes a long way, and i don't break out!
my skin feels much cleaner
the only drawback is that i do go through the product rather quickly
i love the experience of this one so much i just use a cheaper water like simple first
so far the fragrance hasn't irritated my face at all
there are less expensive options out there
with very little product
it's a little expensive for what it is
probably more than i needed
i love this cleansing oil so much.
this one is cheaper though
you get a bit more which is why i chose it
it works just as well as the boscia.
i like this one so much better
this clinique one does just as good a job with a smaller price tag
much better than other brands i've tried.
sometimes too much stuff comes out
i find it a little messier to use
definitely leaves it cleaner than with just cleanser
this one seems to work well
i think i like josie maran's cleansing oil a tad better
actually like it more than the expensive balm i had been using previously
as far as face makeup
i actually like this one better than the boscia one
this honestly helps so much cutting through my makeup
they always seemed to leave so much makeup behind
my skin just wasn't liking that too much
it's cleared my face more than it was before
i like using the pump much more than the take the day off balm in the tub
my skin is soft and clearer than ever.
my pores look smaller and skin looks better.
never wear too much make-up to begin with
there is no better way to remove eye makeup
this size is even better
the price is very decent as well since it lasts for months
i usually use 3-4 pumps depending on how much makeup i have on
rather than some other ones
just like many others
my skin is basically "normal" maybe tends to be slightly dry at times
rather than taking off the makeup
it is even better than makeup wipes
i don't have to use a ton of the product since it slides around pretty easily
you get more product for your $ than the boscia as well
my skin felt a little tight afterward
a little goes a long way which is nice on my wallet
wish there was more product.
your makeup will look better
this primer also helps control the oil in my t-zone making my make up last much longer
helps the makeup look fresher for longer
this little stick is a miracle
i like it but for the price expected more.
not as much as the milk make up a blur stick
i've never used much foundation on the rest of my face
you only need to use a little bit
the first day i used it my friends noticed immediately how much smoother my skin looked
a little goes a long way.
my skin look more smooth without being heavy
i think it's better than benefits porefessional
my skin even looks better on the days i do not wear foundation
it lasts a long time because you don't need much
you only need a little
that's how much it means to me
is much brighter immediately after use
i just hate how expensive it is!
i don't feel like it does much for helping my makeup last longer
i still give it 5 stars though.
i find that it works better that way
also, a tiny bit goes a long way.
my makeup applies so much better
very little is needed
a little bit goes a long way!
feels great going on and my face looks clearer!
a little definitely goes a long way
much more mature women alike
i don't know that it really makes pores smaller as much as it makes the make up go on
wear well during a long work day
overall it does what it says
just felt the price is a bit much :
does initially make a big difference
i also found the scent a little too heavy for my taste
this helps make a little go a long way
this is even better
not too strong at all
so far i love the results.
my skin looked so much better
see if there are longer term results
because it's a little richer
this is the only cream i've found so far that is rich enough for the winter
you will end up using the whole bottle a lot faster
my skin is just better
far less dry than it has been in the past
my face feels so much happier
it is a little heavier than my morning moisturizer
that can take a little longer
moisturising but not too heavy.
it was just too heavy for me
my makeup has probably applied easier with the moisture
if this had a little bit of sunblock in it
evens my skin tone a bit too
and the smell isnt too much.
i might move to something a little heavier in moisture during winter
wow me a little more for the price
not so much that you end up greasy
a little definitely goes a long way.
a little goes a long way do the price point is perfect
i liked this product much more than i expected to
i much prefer the cream version
i would definitely recommend using something a little heavier for nighttime
makes it feel tighter
it is a little pricey for a mask
it was more than i wanted to spend
nothing has ever made my pores look smaller
the breakouts were much more minimal than usual
moisturizers go on easier and i use less.
i've used it 3x so far
as it can be a bit drying if done too often
more fun than function more often than not
my skin is much smoother
already getting compliments on my skin looking smoother
a little goes a long way.
even though there was that one pitfall it seems like it was worth it
i left it on longer
i like it better than the glamglow product.
plus a little goes a long way!
washing it off my skin was so much brighter
i plan on buying it though , so far so amazing!
i never imagined spending more than $30 on one
a little goes quite a way
you will use much less than other masks
that i seemed to be breaking out a lot less frequently
however i don't see much of a change.
my skin felt so much smoother
all it did was work better
a little goes a long way
so far i haven't had any issues
it's much better than the over-hyped glamglow masks that everyone talks about in my opinion
i've 'accidentally' left it on longer
the results from this product have been satisfying thus far
it help my skin so much
make it look a whole lot better
i've tried so many masks
this one helped so much balance out the oil in my t zone
i used it just once so far
but now i found the better one.
this mask is so much easier to apply than glamglow's masks
i felt like applying it with my fingers wasted too much product
my breakouts looked so much better
my pores seem tighter as well
my face felt so much more cleaner and smooth.
my face felt so much more cleaner and smooth.
my face felt so much more cleaner and smooth.
my face felt so much more cleaner and smooth.
my face felt so much more cleaner and smooth.
my face felt so much more cleaner and smooth.
refined with no irritation what-so-ever
always had to apply more product as the day progressed
correcting works slightly didn't notice too crazy of a difference however
it's a bit pricey for what it is especially since i haven't noticed much change in spots on my face
as well as using less rather than more is a definite with this product
a little goes a long way
i just wish it was a bit cheaper.
it has helped so far with fading them
well this cream does that and more!
i can definitely say my skin has become more radiant
a little goes a long way
it only feels greasy if you put too much.
when i wash it off my skin looks so much brighter
even though it has spf
more of a good all purpose day cream
it no longer feels sucked up but feels amazing.
a little goes a long way!
it is sold at a little bit of a higher price point
a little goes a long way.
after 3 months my skin does seem a lot brighter
an added bonus i didn't expect was how much it actually brightened my skin
it is much better when i wake up
i've tried so many other things
this actually works so even though its expensive
my skin is more even-toned
this product has helped even out my tone
did not make my skin tighter
i think this would be better in a sturdy pump so there'd be no chance of knocking the bottle over
at 40+ my skin is far from flawless
so far i'm really liking it
i couldn't be any happier with this purchase.
my skin looks a lot healthier
i also will sometimes just put it on my face during no-makeup days when i feel like my skin needs a little boost
works well under make up too.
i think it's improved my under eye darkness a little over time too
like it for brightening better than other products
this is a little too pink for me
although it would be better if it came in more colors
not too heavy at all
but other than that it's great.
if i want fuller coverage
a little bit goes a long way.
is much littler than concealer
i love this eye cream soso much!
since a little product goes along way
it also makes the area naturally look better over time
the packaging is a little different
a little goes a long way.
ever since i was little
i wish it had a little more color correcting power
if this product was a bit greasier
you do not need very much product per wear
feel like it could be a little drying
could be i used too much so it caked up.
as far as smoothing the eye area i don't think it does much for that
a little goes a long way.
she has gotten so many compliments
feels better about herself
make me look much older than i am
a little goes a long way with this product
my eyes are revived and i feel so much better!
they look so much better
my only concern is that i travel quite a bit
wasting much of the product
have always struggled with dark circles
it is on the more sheer side
i've tried more under eye products than i can count
a little goes a long way i have had this product for 4 months
i find it hard sometimes just to get a little dab now that im half way through the tube
this little tube gets it
a much more natural-looking way to tackle those dark circles
i no longer even need an under eye concealor.
i just wish it hydrated a bit more
still too early to tell
since it is a little too light to use alone
it works a little better with concealer
a little goes a long way with this product too.
i've tried quite a few different products
this is great for more intense under eye coverage
if that tip makes the product more pricey they should just get rid of it
feels more like the eye cream than anything
love it so much!!
this is the first time they have improved somewhat
t made my face a lot smoother
a little bit more in the morning as under eye concealer
i like it well enough
it can be a bit messy
isn't too harsh for me
like the more you apply the less it goes on
looks so much brighter afterward
my skin looks much tighter
more even toned after every use
already 3x more even
seems a little hard to apply on your face
love the results so far
i also like that you get so much more for the money
i left it on for longer than recommended
while its too soon to say if its made my skin brighter
my pores are so much better
i leave it on longer sometimes
the only reason i give it a 4 is i want my little bumps i had for years to go away :
wish they made a bigger jar.
sometimes more often than that when ive had a tiring day
the more i use it
the better my skin feels
works all too well
it smells much better than sulfur masks
you get so much product
with that said i do believe there are ones that are better
again would be more expensive
usually nothing makes a huge difference after one use
this product has help with my dryness so much.
a little goes a long way
these drops feel more like water
i like using this more than another moisturizer because i think the ingredients here really complement the ones in the retin-a rather than add on to them
makes my skin much softer
was scared that this might be too much for my face because i am also oily
way better than the cucumber mask.
along with my clinique even better essence
from the first day my skin looked so much better.
i certainly like it better than hydraluron.
i feel like my complexion has improved so much since i started using these boosters
the tone is more even
it just looks better overall
every smidgen of foundation gone
it sometimes stung a bit
my skin always feels so much better after i use this
three weeks and so far so good.
at first i used way too much
this product is even better
it works so well
so far so great!
now i love it more
it takes a bit more to remove some long lasting makeup
this is way better than any traditional
the even more amazing thing about this cleanser?
wayyy better than those cheap
i would say that this product is much better for others with combo/oilier skin
usually i think of masks as more of a fun thing to do more than something that usually shows results
even though this is expensive
a little bit goes a surprisingly long way
my face seems over all smoother
i also notice that my pores seem smaller which is probably my favorite thing about this mask
a little goes a long way
my pores have been getting worse
my face looks tighter
there is so much product in this jar
maybe even heal the damage a bit quicker
a little goes a long way, and the tub is huge.
that says a lot as i'm not normally a repurchaser
it just kept getting worse
i do think its a little pricy
the fact that my skin felt so much softer after i washed the gel off
although it is a bit pricy
such a little bit goes a long way
more even where my scars were
it seems like this will last quite a while
a little goes a long way
hour or even more sometimes
my skin is brighter than ever
my skin looked so much smoother
like that use better
a little goes a long way too!!
makes it feel more firm
if i put just a little under my eyes
don't like it so much as a night mask
with a more even skin tone
it will be smoother
i love it so far
not much product is needed
as far as anti-aging benefits i think it's too early to comment
more even toned the next day
so far i like this
it does everything it claims and more!!!
it seems that it will last a very long time especially if used 2-3 times as suggested
i couldn't be happier with this
every time i use this my face looks better.
my skin is also becoming more even as my old blemishes fade
a little goes a long way
my skin is so much more even
spent so much money
while some things help a little
which i should have known better than to use since starting retin-a
so far so good
if it works half as well as it feels
they can be a bit strong
i only use this about every other day or at night with a heavier moisturizer
if i have any complaint it is that it is very hard to not overuse this product because a little goes a long way
if you tilt the bottle just a little bit too much you end up with a very soapy face
i still need something extra for my eye makeup
this is the only non scrub i've used so far that actually feels like my skin has been cleaned
not much considering the cost of real rose oil
a little oilier in the summer
you only need a little bit
a little of this cleanser goes a long way
a little goes a long way, too.
a little goes a long way.
product lasts forever, and takes so little!
my face looks better than ever.
it's quite thick so a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way.
yes it is quite expensive
lathers well so a little goes a long way
generally just all around better than it was before i switched to this
i ended up liking this so much better.
so far i have had great results with all of ptr products
my skin is more glowy now than it's ever been!
as i can see it being too harsh for you
very little goes a long way
it can be a little harsh in an every-day face wash
a little goes a very long way!
initially it took some getting used to because there really aren't any suds
a little goes a long way using this way
this is much better than the other ptr cleanser.
the price is good for how much product you get
the gel consistency takes a little getting used to
i feel like it does a much better job
a tiny bit goes a really long way
a little goes a long way especially if you use it with a clarisonic
a little goes a long way
this particular one is much more suited to my combination skin
a little goes a long way
i took off one star because this is so expensive.
$75 is a little pricey for a mask
a little goes a very long way
is a bit heavier for coverage
i just looked so much better
does not make lines more pronounced like most other foundations
my skin is much more dry than when i was younger
it takes very little to get coverage
a little goes a long way
even a little luminous -- far better than it looks after an hour's wear for nine out of ten foundations i've used in my life time
it looks better right after applying it
however with this i never have much shine.
hopefully they make a lighter shade like the foundation
it just looks like you have better skin than you do
better ingredients do cost more
i love this foundation so much.
it's of a thinner consistency than foundation
i couldn't be happier.
to add a little more coverage
as far as quick
pricey, but a little goes a long way.
just gives me a little bit of extra color
which i actually prefer since that makes it even more natural looking
this will just be too dark
it has very little coverage yet it magically evens out my tone
i've gotten compliments lately on how healthy
i've spent so much money over the years for sheerless foundations
it is a little light
perfect for my changing skin as i'm getting older
my skin tone was more even
i just wish they were a little less costly
nothing has ever been as long lasting as this product on my skin
it never fades or cakes so the shininess looks better than it naturally would if that makes sense
first product review- i like it that much
it has changed my face for the better
you don't need very much
it's build able for extra coverage too
is not too much
i can apply a little more if i need cover a spot
really makes my face look much better
i think i would have given it 5 starts if it had a few more options in color
lately i've been wanting to try liquid foundation
a little goes a long way
because it is so light
i really wish it was cheaper.
it looks so natural and it last all day long!
no matter how many times i washed my face or what product i used
i continued to use it even though it was a little too dark because i loved it that much
i've never been one to wear much makeup
my skin seems to look better even when i'm not wearing it
never thought i'd be paying this much for foundation
in the winter i like to look a bit more polished
i just put on a bit more
give a little bit of coverage
a little goes a long way with this product
i really hope they come out with a lighter color.
i looked like i had more color than usual
i love the no make up make up line so much
i don't have much to cover up
i do like that it doesn't settle into fine lines as much as other foundations
this was a bit too dark for me
a little bit truly does go a long way
i wish they'd come out with a lighter version
i plan on putting a lighter foundation in with it because i love it too much to stop using it
covers extremely well without looking like you have much make up on
it is still a little dark
i usually have to mix something a little lighter in with it
if there was a fairer shade
perhaps is is if you are darker than the foundation
any more and i look quite orange.
would really like it if it came in a greater range of colors so more people could enjoy the product
this is so light
my skin is so much smoother
can also layer nicely if you prefer more coverage
i couldn't be happier
more than some to be honest
i think josie maran's liquid self adjusting foundation is better though
a little goes a long way despite it's thin consistency
a little goes a very long way!
it looks just as good as my more full coverage foundations
all you need is a little bit.
even after an intense work out
the smell is probably more towards men
a little goes a very long way
more than 2 pumps is too much
not as red as usual
i've tried more products than i can even remember over the years that claim to do this or that
one of which i actually hadn't gotten much sleep —
i put a little bit on in the morning
a little goes a long way- two drops does the job.
my skin looks more even
i swear they grow faster
backs of my hands look noticeably better too
even though it is an oil
so far i like it.
so far the mask is good for the season transitioning in new engl
will have to see if its good enough for winter too
it'a little bit on the pricey end
i did discover that you only need a little bit of this product to do the trick which is great cause i don't have to replenish as much
more money in my pocket.
it was a difficult purchase due to the price being much higher than what i would usually pay
a little goes a long way though.
it works so well
they all didnt seem to help or work as much as this one does
my skin feels a thousand times better!
my skin looks much better
it goes a long way
a little bit goes a long way
it is such an easy night time routine to get better skin
almost gotten rid of some very fine ones
it works so well that i've gotten past it
a little goes a very long way
no night cream has done a better job so far by nourishing my skin
as far as the scent
i think the sample was a little difficult to use just because there was no dropper
i couldn't be happier.
a little goes a long way
sometimes make-up can make it look worse
yes this eye cream is expensive i wish it wasn't quite so much money
i am slowly switching to investing in a full line of products tata harper as everything i've tried has been phenomenal so far
if i apply too much
it is helping my dark under circles little by little
that little spot on my h
a little goes a long way
my makeup would crease badly under my eyes making me look older than i am
a little bit goes a very long way.
i loved it so much i ended up buying a jar
so far is keeping my dark circles at bay
perhaps it is a bit too rich for my summer skin.
more than fine lines my issue is dark circles.
a little goes a long way
i love this product so much!
i still have quite a bit of product left
while it brightened more than this product does
definitely looks healthier since using
i feel much more awake
lines seem to be less
a little goes a long way
it turned out surprisingly good :)
but don't expect too much for any other concerns
the consistency is more like a gel
such a nice little luxury with which to start
a little goes a long way
it is a little bit sticky at the end
a little goes such a long way!
i know it's pricey but a little goes a long way.
maybe i'm using too much product.
were way too greasy
it works so much better
loved how just a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way!
needed in this little miracle of a jar
which i should probably drink more of
more clear than ever before
she felt significantly better
she likes it too
many times my eyes are just tired
a little goes a long long way: dime-sized dab is enough for both eyes
it looks like it's going to last a long time so that makes the price reasonable
the tiniest bit goes a long way
a lot goes a long way.
a little goes a long way
this is soooo much better
a little goes a long way so a jar lasts me a very long time
a little goes a long way.
i only wish it were a little more brightening.
a very small amount seriously goes a long way.
felt so much improvement to my eye area
the price is a little high
a great value relative to all the more expensive stuff out there
my under-eye area would flake a little bit
really far away from actual eye area
i like it more if it could reduce the fine lines
i like the black tea one better
a lot goes a long way.
too much before makeup will make my skin greasy.
at night however i use a little extra.
because you use so little of it
i would have saved so much money!
i can only imagine how much lighter they would be if i would remember to use it consistently
so far this serum has been the only thing that actually works for the freckles
my dark spots were a smidgen lighter or the area around the spot was lighter
these are a little spendy
can find a better quality
the price is a little too much :
i've never found any that work this well
my pores were visibly much smaller when if was done
considering how much of a difference they make
tons of the smaller ones you didn't even know you had too
the patch is a little smaller than the drugstore kind
nothing works better than this product!
work better than any pore strip i've ever tried
can't believe how much better these work than the drug store strips
i would have given this product 5 stars if it was a bit more reasonably priced
this product cleaned out my pores much better
feels better than it has in years
2nd time was better because i adjust the fitting more to me by not following the instructions
i've tried the boscia ones too
definitely better than any drugstore br
it is a little expensive for just one use-
this is the only one that is even close to doing the job other than going to get a facial
it seemed to grab quite a bit
i usually leave it on a little longer than the package recommends
the peach fuzz takes a little longer than that to grow back
it seems like every year my blackheads just get worse
but it didn't get very many of the smaller ones.
i definitely want more of these strips though!
these work so much better
it does so much better than biore
how do we make the strips more effective?
tho this 2 step process is more time consuming than i would like it to be
it turned out to be more effective then the normal ones you may get in the drugstore
see how much i got out
never had much success
way more than the best result i've ever gotten from biore
i noticed it stuck better than some of the other pore strips i've tried
it's a little too expensive for what it does.
this was much nicer
it is more of an immediate benefit to really deep clean
s do make their most strips quite a bit wider than these
very little goes a long way
been a month... so far loving it!
the results i've been seeing thus far a beyond amazing
since the shiseido always felt a little too heavy
i still very much like the caudalie
a little goes a long way with both day
you need so little it will last a long time
with 40 approaching that is getting more challenging
still way too expensive for my budget.
you can tell pretty quick it's better than your average cream
i would never buy this product because it is so expensive
so far it hasn't worked any miracles for my dark circles
makes makeup go on easier
felt like it may have made my under eye bags worse
a little goes a long way
did it that way => i added a little water to my h
there is much worse out there lol i like to use this mask
a little goes a long way
i can actually notice my skin looks cleaner
was a little tough to rub off
i've probably had it for a little more than 3 months at this point
mainly because you don't need to use that much
a little goes a long way
also looks cleaner too after using this
it only got bigger with the cleanser
it honestly smoothed them so much
i rarely ever notice anything different in the way my skin looks after using a mask until i found this
leave me a little raw
my face was a little tight
have tried a lot of products only for them to either dry out my skin even more or create even bigger breakouts
seriously how did i live without this before?it has improved my skin so much
but overall i think the black one is better.
it got so much worse
they are even more flakey
as far as improving my skin
my face was soft, and felt much better after use.
i love how i only have to use a little bit so the price point isn't as bad as you think
leave it on awhile longer than noted
i went through it way too quickly though
i suggest getting it though.
a little goes a long way!
i like it much better
it makes you feel so much more clean
it has such a nice tingle that isn't too much.
my face has never felt softer or felt more clean.
this made it so much worse
ever so slightly tighter
i couldnt use it very much during the winter months
my face was much more clear
great product and will try more from her line.
i usually spend more on my makeup than face products
my face hasn't looked this even
now, my dark spots are not gone but very faded.
though hard to keep stabilized at times
this was one of the stronger ones i have tried
so many ingredients seem to break me out
more that when it comes to aging
none-the-less i love it
i see that my makeup goes on more smoothly
at a little lower price point
am so far a fan
i couldn't believe how quickly it improved the look of my skin
it plumps those up too so that's an added bonus
my face is looking so much brighter
a little goes a long way
at the same time i also think people are applying way to much
i even noticed in the little video clip it shows the model grabbing way to much product on her fingers
the darker bags under my eyes are no longer there
and a little goes a very long way.
only gave it four starts because i dont have much to compare to
it is sticky but a little goes along way!
i wake up with eyes that seem much more alive
she then dircted me to this product that was more expensive
plus a little of this product goes a long way.
using too much will make it feel sticky.
i no longer look tired
just know that a bit goes a long way
a little bit of this will go a long way
great too for evening out after a long day.
a jar lasts quite a long time
my makeup looks so much better.
a little goes a long way.
a little goes a long way
t's not too big of a problem for me considering how well the product works otherwise
applying this gel before i go to sleep makes them so much better
so after a couple of uses i couldn't believe how much better my under-eye area got
a little goes a long way
her under-eye area was so much less puffy within 15 minutes
a little goes a loooong way with this
a little goes a long way
some people who are complaining about it sliding around are probably putting far too much on
i think they're using way too much product
less tired look to them
i've never found anything better.
a little goes a long way
my under eye looks so much brighter all day long.
this helped my puffiness so much
my skin felt much more firm than usual the next morning
this face mask feels a little intense the first time you use it
it will help bring them to a head faster
works only a bit better
it left my face feeing much smoother
my pores looked tighter afterwards as well
you will see brighter
not in a painful way
is so much smoother
i feel like my dark spots left from previous breakouts look a lot lighter now
it stings a little at first
it works so well
while they are all quite nice this pumpkin enzyme one is far
it stings a little at first but it passes.
it works so well that it more than makes up for it
leaving a smooth far from dull skin.
i can see my face with a more even tone
i can see my face looks much better
it did sting a little
it feels a lot softer.
i only wish that the exfoliating bits were bigger
my face is lighter because it's so much cleaner
it's smoother than i've felt the skin on my face in a while
if left on any longer it can damage it
a little does go a long way!
i'd give more stars if that were a thing.
the more you use it
little goes a long way
skin tone was more even
it can burn a little the first few times you use it
concealer making my makeup look so much better
i left this mask on longer than recommend
it seems a bit pricey
a light layer does the trick so this has lasted quite a long time
his face just looked more
although it is a bit pricey
it still gets the job done
i like this a little better than the honey mask because it is less irritating on my face
it leaves may face a little red
the products i use after seem to have better effects as a result
very comparable to if not better than the exfolikate scrub/mask
other than that i like it!
i like the results so far.
that is pretty normal
because i have no idea how i have lived without it for so long
am at the age where i want my skin to be babied as much as possible
quite a bit more than i expected
i feel like it tackles smaller blemishes too
after that it's much milder
what's even better is that the results actually last
my makeup goes on better
my skin looks so much more even
even though it says for aging skin
we have tougher skin
its quicker and more effective than the glam.
you're smoother than ever
i would say glamglow is a lot worse
it did tingle a little bit
this is fine as long as i don't leave it on more than 5 minutes
however it was too much peel
not so much that i would take a star from my rating
this gets the job done like no other.
a little goes a long way
it did sting a little
a little bit goes a long way!
purchasing a lot more than just one item
a little out goes a long way
see a difference in my face- it's a lot clearer
its a little bit more than i like to spend on a "not every day product"
i hardly break out now
yes, i like this product very much.
like i said my go to cleaner!
i am going to use a more gentle cleanser in the am since i'm no longer broken out
two things i love about this face wash is that a little goes a long way
this is the only cleanser i've tried so far that actually
they either make what acne i have worse
does a better job at removing makeup
i think the product does was it claims as far as removing all the dirt
wanted a great cleanser that is a little cheaper
i feel like my skin is much more balanced
so far, i have enjoyed this product.
i conditions get worse
i usually do not spend this much on moisturizer
my skin tone is better
it only takes a little
i can see it being oily if i used more than that.
might see even more results with more time
make you look more fresh
it makes it look smoother
i only use it at night to make it past longer
now makeup goes on much more smoothly.
my skin look more even
for this works better than anything i have ever used
they usually never worked well
this is the only product i have found that actually helps my face feel better in every way
very much disliked because it cause so many problems for me
like other reviews said it is pretty thick so use just a little
my neck is firmer, too.
you need to use a very small amount as a little goes a long way
this makes my face looks brighter and younger.
a little goes a long way.
my skin tone is more even.
a little product goes a long way
also a little goes a long way which helps justify the price
my face looks so much better now that i'm using in
my skin has never felt smoother
a little goes a long way.
you only need a little to do the job so this jar lasts a while
my face is looking smoother in just 3 weeks.
you don't need much at all because it absorbs quickly
a little goes a long way
my skin looks so much better since using this product
my skin was looking better than it looked in my 30s
it wasn't "by the box" as far as what my skin could h
no way around it
i wish the price was a tad lower
it calms my skin down so much
if i feel like i didn't get enough sleep i used it in the morning too i had noticed that my skin looks more plumper
since i don't really care much for skin care or have a routine
no more needs to be said.
my skin tone seemed more even after one use
my complexion was so even
a little bit goes a long way.
my face has become 10 times more even
this just makes my skin look...fresher?
i do wish it was more comparable to even better tone corrector
a little goes a long way!
i don't think i will pay more than 70$ for it
would rather start with a half pump
use a little more if necessary
with all clinique products i've noticed a little goes a long way
even though it is a little pricey
quickly had to go get some more
my skins started acting better
and feel like i look better than ever.
this is better than anything
that is getting lighter also!
this is a lot better than my expectation
love it so much
i found that my breakouts were much shorter
i usually buy the cheaper even better dark spot corrector for that reason
as far as skin tone
a little around the eyes
so probably a bit young for it
more even in tone
this works better than anything else i have ever used
it works much better than some of the more pricy competitors i have tried
my skin did look a little better overall
it did help my actual moisturizer sink in a bit better
wanted to change it up a little
i feel it lasts a long time
i wanted to do more for my skin
a little goes a long way which is great.
my skin tone is more even
keep in mind results from this product do take a while because it is doing so much
for instance if your only goal is to fade dark spots you might see faster results from a product targeted to do only that
normally i wouldn't spend so much on a serum
even my family saw that my skin was better.
however now that i am getting a little older i am noticing some dull dryness
my skin looks so much brighter
a little goes a long way as well.
i love how much skin feels after
and my skin has never looked better.
it'll last you quite a long time
because of this i've been very hesitant to try anything other than the products that seem to keep the trauma to a minimum
i'd like to know what makes this pro dub so much more pricey than similar ones
this oil is nothing less than awesome: my face is looking better than ever
i can say with confidence that i experience 'em 80-90% less
because you only need a little bit of product each time
i travel quite a bit
you may be using too much
i smell that more than the eye cream
not too sticky and a little goes a long way.
and only has made my mornings longer.
i like that it's a little bit cheaper than other br
stick with it for a bit
need a little help with the wrinkles that are starting
so far so good!
going through a stressful time lately
dark circles are still there though
it goes a long way
i could certainly see firmer skin tone
it was too much
of course much cheaper than fillers :
this has worked far better
you only need the tiniest bit so
dark circles are slightly lighter as well.
are definitely a little lighter
might be too much
looks younger when i use it consistently
it's not too heavy and a small bit goes far.
just a little dab goes a long way
compared to the night version of this it smells much nicer
like the day cream much more
a little does go a long way
i would say my skin looks brighter
as far as the actual cream goes
so far i think it is great
it looks more even and feels great.
perhaps this will be clearer after more time
it makes your makeup looks better
i left it on a bit longer than suggested
i will say i think the packaging could be improved as sometimes this spurts out of the tube
i can see my face getting brighter
i think the packaging could be better
deeper crease between my eyes have become more of a problem
i could feel my face was already much smoother
even when waiting a bit too long to rinse
even you can see the results will stay for more than 2 days without using it
even harder to live with
it would make a lot more sense if it came in a bottle
who uses it too
much smoother than usual
it's improved my skin quite a bit
i liked it so much that i would easily buy the full version
so maybe they tweaked the formula
will break out or go red from quite a lot of products
my face feels so much better!
the skin looks better
a little goes a long way.
because this is so much better
i've used it a few times so far
i love it and a little bit fits a long way.
since i work out often
the effects don't last very long
find that my skin is much brighter
it delivers so much in so little time.
still does seems to brighten things up quickly
so far, so good though.
my skin looks so much smoother and clearer.
it is so much calmer
wish there was more in the tube.
my face is a little tight
the sale assistant recommended me just take little bit amount every times using
the eye cream elsewhere to see how i liked it
since it is so expensive i only use it at night
a little goes a long way with this product
after using it for a little more than 3 weeks
which goes a long way
my skin is more even toned
this is much better for the lamer line is very greasy
i like it very much.
i probably haven't been using it long enough
it takes a few weeks to start seeing results so you have to be a little patient
i just look more rested and healthier overall.
i love this one so much
it takes so little to cover your face
it has zero downsides that i could even stretch to find
'll try almost anything to make it look better
a little goes a long way
if i could give this product more than 5 stars
it immediately made my skin feel slightly tighter
a little bit goes a long way.
looked so much better without makeup
as well as makeup was applying better
basically just got worse
the lines get more
i never paid much attention to serums before
it made my skin even more softer
my skin looks better then it has in years
my skin was smoother than ever
so far it has all my trust
i guess it "helps" more than it hurts your skin
i can use this differently.'
healed very faster than before
i see faster results
figured i'd just use it up rather than toss it
purchased it because i liked it so much
my skin has never looked better.
i found that i had to use a much smaller amount of my usual serums when layered over this
my skin is much softer
i would even say brighter
a little bit of this goes a long way
too bad its not more affordable
very little of this is needed to cover my entire face
any moisturizer you put on top truly seems to sink in better as well
i notice that my skin get better
even better after a few days my skin was smoother than ever before
looks much better now
a little goes a long way
the oil would be too much
i will no longer be without ultimune!
clear so far after a weeks use
night so a little goes a very long way
definitely brighter than before
my skin feels smoother, too
like many products at first it feels greasy or heavy
), but my face definitely looks much better.
i think tightened too
haven't seen big difference so far
my skin looks so much better
thought that it was quite pricey
it does so much
actually makes my skin smoother under my foundation
in the morning too
a little goes a very long way.
short term, this feels good.
give it a little time
i wish it was less expensive however.
it actually goes as far as calming
so much so that i don't think i can ever go back to my box of previously purchased facial products
some of which probably contri
as far as the smell is concerned
however it doesn't make it worse
use as little or as much as you want depending on your moisture needs
i felt it was a little on the greasy side
would most likely use with a heavier night cream in the winter
they may be slightly less severe now.
t runs out too fast for the $
also with getting a little older
hasn't made it worse either
my skin looks so much more even
it could smell even worse
my skin has really significantly gotten better since using this
the real selling point came when i got a little too aggressive with a benzoyl peroxide gel on my face
it's 15 dollars more than the other origins masks
however, i like the smell a lot.
my skin did look better and felt softer.
this product makes my face so much softer
i love it so much!
some being better than others
i could go longer
even better than origins' other hydrating mask
no breakouts so far
i definitely will try more algenist
makes it look more plump
the "film" will help a moisturizer to soak in so much better than normal
i feel like my skin is so much smoother as if i just heavily exfoliated
never would i have spent this much on face wash.
a little does go a long way with this cleanser
having it last a long time is cheaper than buying a bottle of the cheap stuff once a month
with very little effort
it has left my skin looking healthier
perfect for when winter's being extra mean!
i tend to use it less in the summer
i'll definitely be on the look-out for a similar product that smells better
the price seems a little high
my skin is happier too!
no more tight look or feel afterwards.
because a little goes a long way
couldn't ask for more from a product.
a little bit goes a long way
well the over-the-counter seem to make my skin worse
it lasts a really long time
a little goes a long way and so this will last.
it feels so much smoother
love it very much
)it smells nice and a little bit goes a long way.
if you get it even a little bit wet
it won't work well
makes my makeup go on so much smoother
it is on the expensive side, which is a bummer.
no eye cream has never done much other than keep the area hydrated
a little goes a long way with this cream
more is more in this case.
which i think i love even more
who knows if using it for longer
i like this product much more than the popular algenist complete eye balm
sure enough the deeper one in between my eyebrows is almost gone now
tons of eye creams even more pricey than this one
my face looks a lot better than it did
my complexion looks more even
it's a lot better than most people make it out to be on here
does more than what it says.
this helps for that too
as long as this keeps works for me
this serum helps calm it better or more consistently than others
so a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way
my skin has been so much clearer
it does get it off mostly
it makes it so much easier to wash your face.
the reason why i switched to another cleanser is because i thought it might be a little to strong for my skin
my pores seem a little smaller after i wash it off
a little bit goes a long way
it's pricey, but a little goes a long way.
a little goes such a long way
love it just as much as i did in summer when i'm oily
the only thing that would make it better would be a bigger size :
it doesn't make it worse like so many other products i've tried
a great way to try it without spending to much or ask for a sample
you need a very little amount of it.
it foams just a little
pure truth does that but better!
it's also helped my skin look much clearer
it actually makes my skin smoother
a little goes a long way
maybe a dime size or a bit bigger
i give it four stars instead of five because it does feel slightly oily
not so much getting eye makeup off
this cleanser removes makeup better than anything i've ever tried
pretty much an ideal product in that regard.
i still like to though
could find very little dirt still remaining
it lasts so long
to make sure not too much oil stays on my skin
the boscia was no longer ideal
much better than the other makeup remover by shiseido
wish it were a touch less expensive
two pumps a day is more than enough for my face
for an expensive product it should do more than just hydrate
it stings a little during application, though.
a bit thinner than one would expect from an eye cream
it doesn't last as long as thicker products do
the tone is more even
it does make your eye area a bit more "fresh"
and my eye shadow goes on so much smoother.
that makes it a lot better
a little goes a long way
it is heavier than some face creams for sure
so far i love it!
sometimes you need more than just lotion
have taken my skin care much more seriously to prevent any more skin problems once i get older
matter of fact, it looked better.
while i notice friends my age have tiny crows feet beginning to form or start to have fine lines becoming more defined they always ask what my secret is
i could not be happier with origins
i normally would never spend this much on a moisturizer
i'd rather have nice smooth skin
my skin looks way way better after only a week.
i really noticed that i go through the moisturizer quicker than anything else
use it more than anything else in the kit
most leaving my face feeling too greasy
i noticed my skin looked so much brighter
so far no breakouts or problems
my tone was more even
both combined result in me looking 10 years younger than i am
i do use slightly more of this product than recommended on the box
found that i needed more
no oil slick that i normally had to deal with.
just on problem spots because it's too expensive
especially since a lot goes a little way
both seem more like treatments to me.
how much i would need to use
i only wish the jar was bigger
although i do quite a bit of shopping at sephora
i don't think i'd get better results than this
i know the price is a little high
a little bit does go a long way
looks much better as well
my skin has never looked better.
the ha makes my skin look so much smoother
my skin looks so much better
just in 1 week my skin is smoother
those with mature or dry skin will find this is exactly what they've been waiting for
i felt a difference in the texture of my skin so much that my make up went on easier
this feels like it balances my skin more than anything
the other being much less expensive, naturally.
it works even better than the glamglow
feels so much healthier
it has never looked better.
a little goes a long way
unfortunately they are always more expensive
it may be too much for oily skin
even saying that i noticed my skin was even softer than normal
noticed that my skin is so much softer
my only complaint is that the smell can be a little bit off-putting at first
it is now normal thanks to this
seems to do a bit of brightening
a little goes a long way so my sample lasted me a very long time
when i first bought this i was skeptical about the bottle maybe being too small
i love it so much!
my skin has never looked better
sometimes i even use it during the day without any issues
a little goes a long way
i got the travel size and it lasted soooooo long.
i love this mask so much.
i actually put way too much of this on
i love this mask so much!
foundation only made it worse
not sure if it does much more.
plumper than it was the night before
fully absorbs after a little bit
it isn't so much a "mask" as i had thought
this product has helped tremendously as well as knock out any dryness i might have
my face has never looked better
i even use it in the morning if i still have a little dry patch that will look even worse with makeup on top
my skin always looks so much better in the morning
i loved it so much
it would just be to keep it as far away from your eyes as possible because it burns
a little goes a long way.
a little does go a long way so be cautious of how much you use
this winter my skin had a way harder time
the glamglow thirsty mud one--unsure as to which one worked better
glamglow was about $40 more than this one
i am the type of girl that will spend the extra money if it is a better product--
so far it's worked really well.
a little goes a long way!
i've always had normal skin.
recommend it to anyone who needs just a little bit more than an every day moisturizer
$32 is a bit much for a face mask in my opinion
i like that my skin pretty much absorbs it overnight
it makes my skin look much brighter
my favourite skin care product so far!
all of them more expensive
even though i'm pretty old
it works better than my high end masks.
it was too heavy for me then
to those with better skin than me it'll be even better for y'all i'm sure
i loved it so much i've also been using it during the day under my make-up
a little goes a long way as well!
then sometimes just as a moisturizers throughout the day if i feel my skin needs a little hydration boost
i swear it's made my skin so much better
in the morning my skin already felt so much better
better than it have in months
the skin tone looking more even
however, nothing tops this one.
it helps so much
my makeup goes on a lot smoother
i did see my dark spots get lighter which i never usually notice with other products that claim to lighten dark spots
i don't have much dark spot
it works better than anything i've ever tried for dark spots
i like it so much i've just ordered more!
i no longer have that issue :
just a little bit provides the moisture i need
more even when using it
i don't have much dark spot
it works better than any makeup remover i've ever tried
this does that and more.
no complaints thus far.
feels better then ever
it not only removed all of my makeup with little effort
a little goes a very long way
this thing is literally the same thing for cheaper
my skin has never looked better
so far my skin has stayed bright
pretty much covered in acne
but other than that.
so far i really like it
my skin is already looking so much better than it did before
most of my little inperfections are gone
has far fewer bumps
it seems to take longer for oil to break through my makeup
i find the foam formula lasts a long time too which is nice
just wish it was more geared towards oily skin.
i've never found anything better
a little goes a long way and it is decent priced.
i tend to have little bumps on my skin
there is barely any fragrance, which is good.
a little goes a long way
more even-toned than it's been in a while
sephora products are getting better all the time.
i am often always skeptical when trying new products that usually break me out
not too harsh on my skin.
so far it is helping with the wrinkles around my mouth
this product definitely makes my skin much firmer
in general my face just looks better
a little goes a long way--i rub it into all wrinkle
i think i'll keep using it but less often.
so far this is helping
wish it was a tad bigger
maybe next time i'll get one of the bigger "mix your own" type deals
love this stuff, only wish the bottle was bigger.
i still wish the bottle was bigger obviously
i finished the product a lot faster than any other cleanser i've used before
so far so good.
the only reason i'm putting 4 stars instead of 5 is because that price is way to much for me
a little bit goes along way
meaning a little goes a long way
my skin has stayed a bit more matte throughout the day
when i use the mask i no longer get only
keeps feeling better as the day goes on
i love using it when i travel too!
it looks better all day long
most masks dont do much
it feels a little sticky at first
i just feel so much better about myself even under my foundation
was even more clear than before
my makeup lasted far longer
a little bit goes a long way.
gives it more of a result
the next morning i looked so much more refreshed
if it was cheaper
my face is so much more moisturized since i started using this products
it is pricey, but it does work.
more cause a little goes a long way
well it was way more than ok
a little bit goes a long way
which seems to help a bit
my skin was even softer than usual
my very good skin looks even better
this just seems to be a bit better that everything else
my makeup looks so much better the following day
my skin looks so much brighter the following morning
also look so much nicer
make up can go on much better
when i feel my skin needs a little extra boost
i got a trio of these serums as a 500 point reward not too long ago
so far it's been pretty good
have those little bumps on your under-eye area
because the product works so well
i believe they've faded some
i tend to drop out too much of it at a time as the dropper is large
i've noticed they go away much faster with this product than any of the other ones i've used so far -including ones at a higher price point
love it but you don't get much and it is pricey!
so far i have seen pretty good results.
no more pimples come out
nothing works as well on 55+ skin as this.
i see results but it is a bit pricey.
my skin has changed so much using these serums!
wish there was more in the bottle
is more healthy looking
it is even better when mixed with the br
i needed less makeup
i like it very much
love this product so much!!!
this product as it says if you give it a little time
every time i used it i constantly had people telling me my face looked slimmer or that my bone structure was amazing
i've had people tell me my face looks thinner
the newer one works even better
this does make my skin a little more red at first
it actually works better than i thought
makes me feel much younger when it is firmed
made it so much smoother
diminished wrinkles better than anything i have ever used
my skin has never looked better
everything looks tighter and more youthful.
just haven't gotten around to trying
so a little goes a long way.
since a little goes a long way
i no longer worry about people staring at my creases because they are no longer there
no more laugh lines
my makeup goes on so much smoother
i would say this product is perfect for more mature skin or skin of any age that needs some help with shrinking pores
costs much less then other products that don't even come close to it
it did make my skin feel noticeably firmer after i used it
fresh even though days where i feel tired
using it in those areas really makes my makeup look better over the scarring too
a little goes a long way
it takes very little to see results.
a little does go a long way
while i'm probably too young to notice to plumping
it did give a tight feeling which was a little uncomfortable at first
i know that serums could cost way more
i think a tube would be waaay better
a little goes a long way.
a little goes a long way
literally gets a usual face unfortunately
it never feels heavy.
so far so good.
i definitely think it won't hurt with more time
these little buggers have seriously had me questioning all the effort i've put in over the years
maybe i need to use it longer to get better results
as well as at night time
a little goes a long way.
a little goes a long way
so far no problems.
i got the gel too for the day.
i see the results it had on their skin too
how it spreads around my face so well
it also looks better than ever.
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way
couldn't be happier with the product.
a little goes a long way.
this takes a good bit longer.
the bb cream as being much if the reason why
it is slightly oil
a little goes a long way
very concentrated, a little goes a long way!
a little goes a long way!
which in my estimation earns it more than 5 stars
hint: just little goes a long
my skin is pretty normal as far as hydration goes
rather than throwing away this rather expensive bottle
then every other day in the next week as my skin is looking so much better
i know this seems a bit pricy
i more than recommend it
my skin overall looks so much better
recently my spots have been getting lighter at a faster rate
t is easy to pump out too much
my skin never looked better
i will definitely continue to use this product though it's a little pricey
evens my skin tone so much faster than it used to take for them to fade
my skin has never looked better
my skin has never felt more smooth
so far it's great
this product is a little better
not so much better that it justifies double the price
couldn't be happier with this product
i love this so much!
at least so far -i could see why everyone gave it great marks
it takes off the top layer so the cleanser can do a better job at getting deeper into the pores
lately i feel like it's making me break out even more
but, this is so much more!
it works so well
you only need a little bit on a cotton pad
i would give it 5 stars if it were less expensive/came in a bigger bottle
sometimes it burns just a little bit
you do have to use quite a bit though
one con: it does sting a bit though
definitely a little more so than *just* water
not matter how much i have on with complete ease
honestly it is a little pricey
it's amazing how much still comes off
it looks healthier too
saves me so much time also.
it makes it easier in the morning when i'm in more of a rush
so far, so good.
a bit in love with it too
i think it works well with the rest of my routine
i never found one that was better than anything else
so a little bit goes along way
a small amount really does go a long way
giving 4 stars instead of 5 because of how expensive it is
look much saggier when i don't use this plus
its a little on the pricey
a little goes a long way
i know it will only get worse
gets better every morning.
even more pores appear smaller
as a little goes a long way
that's more than twice the amount you usually get when purchacing any kind of face cream
you don't need much, a little goes far.
my skin looks better than it did 5 years ago
a little goes a long way.
my self tanner even looks great when used over this at night
more prone to a breakout once in a while
even though i have combination skin
a little goes a long way.
i just wanted a little more bang for my buck
my face just looks much better after the use
a little goes a long way i found
want to try more from this line
it is pricey but a little goes a long way.
expensive but last long!
keeps getting better with continued use
i then notice that the mask is still very much there
it is so much healthier than ever
there is just no comparison to how smooth
my skin has never looked better.
even use a little extra around my jawls
depending on how much time i have in the morning
i no longer have that tired look in the morning
this stuff is better than any product i've ever put on my face
i think those who said it was sticky used too much
they love it too
i just use a little at a time though.
all before doing more than yawn
slightly tighter than the day before
they last for ages if you don't put too much on
a little goes a long way
i'd much prefer it to stay fresh
lots of little fine wrinkles around
my under eye area hasn't looked this good in a long time
even though the price point is on the higher side
i just wish this product was less expensive!
it makes my makeup look smoother too.
wish it was less expensive
in an almost peppermint way- nothing too strong though-
so far so good, instantly seeing results.
i will definitely be buying more!
i've tried it twice so far.
there is much less or almost no creasing
now even my mother with heavier
lively rather than worn out
now they are more like surface lines
but, so far, it's been amazing!
better than a lot of other products calming to do the same thing
a little goes a very long way.
they became much softer
it is very obvious that the crease is not as deep as before
the lesser are really relaxing
this makes it much less noiceable
a little goes a long way.
i even have a little dab left to get one little line on my neck
they are barely there now
i do notice the furrows more than with it
slow things down a bit
a little goes a long way
a little bit of this product goes a long way.
i can see long term firming too
this works better than those
my lines are still there, but have lessoned.
it just takes some time.
my skin looks better than it has in 5 years!
it has helped with clearing my skin so much
purchased the big bottle although my face is more on the sensitive side it does not hurt my skin at all
so far they have stayed gone ever since i started using this product
it even makes my pores look smaller.
it can be a little messy
my skin is clearer than ever before
it has never looked better
keep in mind that your skin will get worse before it gets better
those are little issues
since i still have quite a bit of other cleansers
there isn't much of an issue
so far it hasn't broke me out
if it is you better believe i'm stocking up
the pump is a little tough
my pores look better than ever.
so far, so good!
resolved it much faster
there love it too
even they seem to be lightening every time i use this
during the warmer months it gets worse
my skin is much better
i've tried pretty much everything from proactive
my skin has never looked better
have been trying different things for years to take care of it
all i have now is a little texture left
the pump on the smaller bottle tends to get stuck tho
a little goes a long way.
one is more then enough
i only occasionally get more than 1 blemish at a time now
it even tingles a little
it's maybe a little too drying for my normal skin
i'll probably switch to something a little lighter like fresh's cleanser
little bumps all over my face
while this product may work differently on people
especially if use too much or use it too often
other than that i love it
wanted to try more of the glamglow line
every time i wonder why i don't do it more often because it pulls so much junk out of my pores
it's a light duty product that helps keep the effects of deep clay masks much longer without having to sit around for half an hour
you will use them less often
a bottle lasts a very long time.
decided to be kinder to my red prone skin.
i need more moisturizer than usual
this is so much better
it is a little pricey
a little goes a long way
even though it's quite pricey
and i still have a lot left.
i used the entire thing up a lot faster than i hoped for $57 a pot
has been around for so many years for a very good reason
it comes off easily leaving little to no residue
my face is no longer red
even a dropper would work better
i think since they are a thicker consistency the pump is not as much of a problem
i think my skin has been looking much fresher
my skin looked better overall
there was no more crepiness at all
it was still too greasy
my skin has never looked better
it costs almost as much
never considered oil as i thought it would be too much
better than anything else i've used including shiseido
it is a little on the expensive side
it has lasted a really long time because a little goes a long way
it's maybe faster with one
which i have been struggling with for quite long time now
i only wish the pump to be better
i tend to use it more when my skin feels off balance or just dull
too bad it's so expensive
even better when you consider its purpose is not fragrance
because i do find it a bit drying if i use it too often
get a bit more of an oil finish
which really helps it to not dry my skin out as much as this has potential to
i see a complete difference on how brighter my face has gotten
how much moisture it has now
it's better at night
getting rid of all products with bad ingredients that were damaging my skin more than helping it
removing one star simply because this is quite a bit to spend on a cleanser
i do not use this twice a day as recommended because i find it a tad drying
it would be too much for my skin to use twice a day
not significantly better than other milky
i love it so far
hoping for even more positive results.
my skin feels better in the morning
there are so many reviews about how good it smells
i guess more than those about how the fragrance causes breakouts
it still works wonders
renewed hope has a more pleasant
i don't want to invest too much up front
i loved it so much
it feels so much lighter than the power of the actual product
though i have not tried a lot of expensive face cream
overall much more beautiful
felt it added too much shine
it doesn't cause me to break out- if anything helps keep my skin clearer than other products may
if i put too much on
so far, i really love it!
after about 1 week of use, so far so good.
my pores look much better
my skin tone is so even
my skin finally feels so much healthier
so far pretty good on my combination skin.
my acne is so much better
i've only used it about 5 or 6 times so far
i like it better than the renewed hope nighttime
little goes a long way!!
a little goes a long way
however i do not see any major difference in my skin as far as the 'renewal' factor goes
it definitely lasts all day as well
i appreciate the fact that a little goes a long way
not too heavy, not too light, just right!
it definitely has made my skin more smooth
nothing else helps as much as this
a little bit goes a long way
has not made my face more oily than it already was to begin with
think it would be too much during the day
this formula is even better than the original absorbs quickly
but so far i love this cream!
the consistency is much airier than the original formula
a little bit goes a long way
a little goes a long way!
i've made peace with the fact that i need to layer more than one moisturizer in order to really bring my skin to normal
my under eyes look a lot brighter
this has helped so much
didn't want to spend more than $50-55
sometimes have a hard time finding makeup
benefit eye cream with not much help
i realized that i like this better than my current eye cream
i feel like my skin is a little smoother
my dark circles are better
not sticky at all and a little goes a long way.
so far so good
dark circles are definitely lighter
it's definitely better than quite a few eye creams i've used
the results i've had so far aren't anything thrilling
have some stuff that could be improved
also a little bit goes a very long ways making it economical at the same time
my bags under my eyes have not gotten better in the past few years cause of school
*four stars because i think it goes better with a water-based cleanser after
a little bit goes a long way.
a little goes a long way
my eyes didnt need much help at this point in time as i'm using the product more as a preventative rather than a fix
i love it so much that i'm a little too generous with the amount i use
a little really does go a long way so you can be frugal
the dark circles have improved a bit, too.
so far it's helped
i’ve never had better skin in my life.
that lasted me 2 months so a little really does go a long way
it lasts a long time too.
my skin has never looked better
my skin has never looked better
the price made me cry a little bit
one pump goes a long way
you can be more generous if you'd like
a little goes a long way
i've realized that it just doesn't get much better than this
a little goes a long way
this is so much better
adds so much moisture
my makeup looks better
all of the tatcha products that i have tried so far
love this oil even better then algenist oil based cleaser
my skin has never looked better
this product description claims that it is meant to take off makeup however it does so much more than that
i no longer worry about applying makeup during the day
i wish it were less expensive
oh, and it lasts for quite a while too.
when i say a little goes a long way
skin is starting to look so much better again after just a few days
a bit little goes a long way
a little goes a long way
i still have a good amount left
my skin has never looked better
it will be taking better care of my skin
i wanted so much for this to be it
i seriously haven't found a better cleanser that does this
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way.
it leaves your skin feeling much smoother
a little bit goes a long way.
a little goes a long way
removes my makeup better than anything i've used before
a little goes a long way
so tried quite many of them
seems to be more absorbing
it made my base so much more hydrating
this is so light
even started to mix it with my foundation
this is my little miracle.
one or two drops really goes a long way.
there is a lot in the bottle
love this oil so much.
perhaps long-term it may
it would get worse when i stopped using it :
most of time time i'm not really paying attention
my lashes have most definitely grown longer
they most certainly have
i don't use much at all around the eye area
ok this review has went on way too long.
i initially used too much oil on my face
found that it did not absorb very well
even using too much did not cause break outs or congestion
was shocked to see how expensive it is which is why i'm only giving 4 stars
a little drop will work for your whole face.
i wish i could give this more than 5 stars.
has also changed my moms making it more youthful
has taken me quite a while to reach to this point
my skin has never ever look better
if you don't put too much on
if you put too much on
a little goes a long way!
by mid- day i always have a little shine
it has worked amazing so far
i love the entire line so much!
it helps so much
it may be a little too heavy for daytime use
however i almost spilled it everywhere the first time i used it so be careful
even though this product is pricey
a little goes a long way
a little appears to go quite a long way
my skin has never looked better
now i really think my skin looks clearer
sometimes i even use it 3 or 4 times a day if i am in
a little goes a long way
if you use too much it definitely leaves a greasy residue
it was too much and i started breaking out.
the oil is too much moisture while the b hydra gel is too little for my skin
also when mixing it with foundation performs a lot better than the other 2
if you need a little extra moisture just add a drop of two of this to any product for a little extra moisture boost
i love it so much!!
only recommendation is not to apply too much.
a little goes a long way
can't wait to see how much more my skin will improve
feel like my skin has only gotten better
a little drop goes a long way.
could see how this would do compared to my usual argan oil
i like this much better than the josie maran argon oil
a little bit is all that is needed.
my skin was more even
i used way too much
although i believe this oil would work well for someone who has older skin
i like it even better than when i was using argan oil
i find it a little less greasy/heavy
even acne is more under control.
leaves my skin very supplei've noticed my acne getting better as well
a little under my eyes
made my skin look much fresher than before
my skin has improved so much
at first my face was a little bit oilier than normal
that is no longer an issue
yes, a little goes a long way.
a little bit goes a very very long way
my skin overall is much smoother and less red.
i would much rather pay more for all natural products that works
certainly not the average skin type
some even more pricey than this
worried it may cause me to burn easier
a little goes a long way
i've had combination skin prone to acne pretty much since my early teen years
overnight there was such a difference i could cover the spots so much easier
the issue i have is is just too strong for my skin
even once a week is too much.
i break out less
overall my skin tone has become more even
a little goes a long way.
my skin is way less oilier than it used to be
the better the results
i seriously would buy more
but it works wonders so i push past the smell
they where not bumpy they where flat which made it easier to conceal
not as much as before
if you use this every other day it will obviously last you much longer
it's stronger than anything i've used before
i can imagine it won't sting for those that regularly use stronger washes
so even though it's expensive
my skin has never looked better until i started using this
my skin just feels brighter
little bumps under the skin
at least not too bad
my acne has gotten so much better
thinking they'd be a little left
i noticed it was so much less red
been about 3 weeks- my skin probably would've been waaay too sensitive if i was still on accutane
it lasted me an even longer time
very far away from that one moisturizer
a little bit before this week
which will be in a while because you only need a little bit
my texture is more even
a little bit goes a long way
definitely smoothed out my skin i look forward to how my skin will look in a couple more months
i like it much better than good genes
my skin texture has improved so much
my face is much smoother
i took a star off though because it is just too expensive for what it is
i love this so much
a little bit goes a very long way
my face is more clear than it has been in years.
my skin does look a bit brighter
so far, so good!
i liked it so much
my face is so smooth and even.
may as well try it out
just from using this for a few days my skin is so much brighter
i felt im not using the same foundation- my skin looked so much better than before
so far this is the most amazing one as i can really tell a difference after several uses
well not any more
i've tried so many masks
it seemed to fade them for the most part
so far pretty content with the results
not sure what it is about this glycolic acid that my skin responds to so much better than others
this product is so quick
i definitely plan on trying out more products from this line
looks like a red spot rather than a bump
its more calmer now
i gotta say after only about a week my texture seems to have decreased significantly
it is a little sensitizing so do use a little caution
just that my skin is a touch easier to irritate
so far i've had a good experience
the results have only gotten better
i love it so far
i've gotten so many compliments on how smooth my face is
your skin finally starts to get better
my skin has never been so smooth
bumpy skin for essentially my whole life
i pretty much have next to no texture after using this
my skin isn't perfect, but so much better.
decreasing to just once a day i felt my skin needed something different
my skin looked better after the first few uses.
you can see that you skin looks more even
although it does last a very long time
i popped into sephora after a stressful week hoping to spend a little money
i did get a few more blemishes than usual
my skin will recover a lot faster
my skin has never been so smooth
i found myself slowly reaching for this one way more
one bar lasts quite a while
it is so much more
it is lasting quite a while
it will keep longer
far less oily, too!
my skin has never looked better
can even be used around the eyes with little to no irritation
my skin has never felt better
although this bar is still on the expensive side
that it lasts for such a really long time
lasts a long time too!
it lasts an impressively long time, too.
it has done nothing
i do see my face getting more
guess mine is getting worse
i think $20 would be more fair
prefer this much more
not rough at all
on days when i wear more makeup
it lathers up much more
it does sting a little bit of it gets in my eyes
even without using that oil i still love how this makes my face feels
i sought this stuff out because it would travel well as a solid
i've pretty much switched over my entire skin care line to de
healthy with very little
i don't mind the little bit of bar slim
a little goes a long way and it is not drying.
only problem is when i travel i carry it in the cute little box i got with it
i've tried probably 70% of what sephora carries
i, rather naively, just kept using the product.
what i appreciate even more is the effect that it has had on my skin
it really does all its says and more!
based on the use i've made of it so far
only downside is that i do seem to be using it up faster than my juju bar
my skin has far less breakouts
so far so good.
i am so happy to say that this product is better than any other foaming wash i've used
although i hate storing it i wish there were a better way to store it
it barely looks like i've used much of the bar
without giving me too much
i didn't realize how much damage i was doing to my face because of highly basic cleansers until i started using lower-ph products
my acne has gone down so much after only the first use
lasts so much longer than any other liquid cleanser i've used
this has better packaging
i'd much rather have a liquid i could easily pump out of a bottle
i actually find the opposite works better for me
it's nice to alternate because i think juju twice a day would end up being a little too much
it not too rough
it is much more than that.
my skin has never looked better
so far, so good!
my skin has never looked better since i started using it
but i have far fewer blemishes with the juju bar.
it's also drier than usual
even though i've upped my moisturizer to be thicker/richer
which i'm mostly okay with
i avoid this with my clarisonic as i find the combination too much for my 50+skin
it definitely keeps my oil at bay longer than other washes do
my skin has never looked better
much less anything really
it lasts for a while too.
completely changed my skin for the better.
so makeup application is so much more fun
the fact that i'm willing to make a long review shows how much i'm in love with this
clean with such little effort
i'd like to try the pekee bar as well.
really helped make my skin be more normal
my skin improve so much
my pores have definitely gotten smaller over time
i still have more than half of the bar left
give the same if not better results
have tried pretty much everything without much luck
my skin has improved so much
more than i expected
the texture looks so much smoother
but this one is so different.
it works better then anything i've used before
so far so good!
it does not dry you out too much
i like to use this when i feel like my skin needs it rather than every morning or night
i love it so far
lasts a long time since it does not take much for it lather up
a little goes a very long way
tonight i grabbed one of the cleansers i had previously been using thinking maybe it would give my skin a little boost since it foams up more
i tried this because i have loved everything from this company so far
haven't seen too much of a difference yet in my pores
just wish it was bigger or cheaper.
so far i really like it
i find it leaves my face slightly red if i use it that way
so far so good
i think maybe those grains were too much of a good thing
all of my usual products weren't helping
my skin has never been better in texture
it lasts a very long time
it's good, but just hoping it will last longer!
i love it so much!
i love it so much
how much i love it!
a little goes a long way.
my skin has never looked better!
every day gets better
my skin has become so much more brightened
this one takes a little time to see the results so be patient
trust me a little goes a long way
i generally have good luck with caudalie products
it feels like a far more generous volume than
i wish this was less expensive
my skin has never looked better.
nothing else has given me so much glow
nothing has really made that go away for more than a couple hours
i am using so little
about half what they recommend is plenty
which i like very much
my skin is more brighter
could give an even more in depth review
i just know after a week or even a month i'd have seen alot more of a difference in my skin
it looks more toned than it has in years
have got better results from these 3 products than everything else combined
better late than never
it goes on so smooth
it felt healthier too
it's doing so much more than that
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way.
u only need a tiny bit so the product goes a long way
have great results so far
maybe better for winter than summer
it's going to last me ages because the smallest bit goes a crazy long way
it feels too smooth!
my usual congested pores are looking so much better
it take of my makeup so well
this gets most of it which is better than other cleansers
a little goes a long way
the more consistently i use this product the better my skin looks
loved it so much i had to get a bigger size
a little bit goes a long way!
a little goes a very long way!
seeing how little i need to use
it could be overpowering to some people
ever been calmer or softer
at night i use something stronger
i feel like my entire face is calmer/smoother
last a long time a little bit goes a long way
a little goes a long way
it actually made my face look a little more clear
this is much better!
a little bit goes a long way
a little goes a very long way.
it didnt seem like it was doing much
this fixed my skin so far!
this works better than any other.
this brand surprises me more and more!
it's much creamier than anything i've ever used in the past
foams just a little bit.
it gets all or most of it off
so much less oily
plus my skin still felt a little tight
its been doing a great job so far!
it does foam up a little bit
also, a little goes a long way.
how little it takes
for how much i paid
so far my face hasn't produced much oil
for eyes i use something faster
any cleanser that claims more than that is just money down the drain
it works with very little needed
it gets the job done without being so harsh like many other products
for a little extra oomph
as well as around it
this one is even better
you get more for the money
so far it has removed all of my make up effectively
this product makes everything more balanced
i am more than ready to
my complexion looks so much healthier too!
this product actually reduced the bags under my eyes so much that i look at pictures from 2 months ago
it also doesn't take very much as it goes a long way
maybe the least expensive i've tried
see how it does brighten the eye area a bit
when i looked up the price i noticed it was a little pricey for the amount you get
a lot better than using a ton of under eye concealer
makeup works better over it
unless something better is developed
i look so much better.
you can see that my left eye is much brighter
just looks all around better
it also brighten a little bit.
it works so well on under eye puffiness i will never be without it
i find the iron a little hard to work with
sometimes change is good
i so far really like the results as well
this product has a little bit of color to it
error i have found less is more
a little really does a long way
wrinkles by at least 50% if not more
though there is a window where you can see how much is left
my skin has never looked better.
a little goes a long way
my skin has never been in better shape
half more because you only need a tiny bit of this stuff
i feel like my skin is so much softer now.
you just need a little amount!
so this tube lasts quite a while
and a little goes a very long way.
a little product goes a long way
it seems even shorter in-person
this is so upsetting to me as this is a more pricey face oil
a little goes a long way.
just a little goes a long way
it goes on so smooth
i look a few years younger too.
when i ran out i didn't repurchase because i wanted to find something bigger for less price
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way.
my skin tone looked more even
i've gotten plenty of compliments on my skin alone
i'd purchase it more regularly if it weren't quite as pricey
i like that this formulation is a little thicker
my makeup goes over it well too.
also, it seemed to have a lot of chemicals in it.
still not too expensive
skin tone is much even so so happy with this product
i love this so much.
was so much smoother
never expected to like this as much as i do
i've gotten so many compliments on my skin lately too
i am use to a more oily consistency with serums so with my first initial try i wasn't expecting much
my skin have never looked better
prevention is supposed to be better than repairing
my skin has never looked better
it goes on so smooth
tends to break out if i use anything too heavy
my skin tone is more even
it definitely doesn't make it worse
i feel like my pores are tighter which eventually should mean less oil production
so far i enjoy using this product night
a little bit goes a long way too which is always nice
i find my skin needs a little more moisture now
so far so good
it absorbs better than korres
one pump is enough for the whole face.
the price was a little too much for me at the time
my few fine lines are looking softer
love it so far
maybe i'm slightly on the wrong side of thirty for this to work as planned
my skin is better than ever
when i want a smoother poreless appearance this is what i reach for
since it is on the lighter side-not heavy at all
my pores are looking better.
i get what people mean by it being more like a primer though
my skin is smooth and has never looked better!
i don't really see much of a lifting or firm though
i've tried so many masks
even still this has made my skin look so smooth
even better looking results
a little goes a long way so this jar will last 6 months or longer
so even though the cost is high
this this made my skin so much softer
leave it on longer
i always leave a mask on longer than they say to
my skin is so much brighter
it makes my skin feel moister if not a little more firm
i left it on for more than the time said.
you need a little lift
a bit longer than directed
this is sooo much better than either products.
even though i love that one too
i like to use especially when i'm breaking out because i do see my pimples will be smaller
they just make my skin tighter
healthy after struggling for so long
am a make up artist so to say i've tried more product
because a little goes a very long way
my skin feels more smooth than ever
a little expensive but is because is perfect!
i love it so much
i never leave on any longer than recommended or my face will start to feel sunburned while it is on
you save a lot of money
when it runs out, i'll be buying more!
without too much rubbing
while pricier than what i would normally spend
it only made my face worse.
i am a little bit noseblind
since such a little bit ago such a long way
immediately after i thought my skin looked a little brighter
see much better results
so far i've used it 3 times
the oil is still bad
not nearly as bad as it was
after my first use i saw how much better my skin was
this product so far is h
it left my skin so much more clean
a little goes a long way for me
it makes my skin so much clearer
soon i found it to been too harsh disrupting all pulling up too much always causing acne
a little goes a long way
i love how little i have to use
my pores are always considerably cleaner
have been dealing with breakouts for too long now
i've actually been likely my skin a lot better now since i stopped using drying products
my life is so much better with this mask
it no longer leaves my face red
i often find myself leaving it on longer just because it feels so great
i actually like it more than glamglow supermud
even felt "balanced" somehow
so far i like it
as much as i wanted to fall inlove with this mask
so i had to try it too.
for the high price tag i expected a little more "wow" factor
which can make your skin produce even more oil
the amount you get is enough to probably last me half a year or even more
it's more mild than my usual aztec clay mask
this is much better
so far i am in love
i see the difference little by little my skin is improving
liked it so much- ordered a jar.
my skin immediately looked better
i love it sososo much!!
my skin tone is always more even after using this
i do use it longer than the recommended 10 minutes
no longer notice anything when i use it
i could see so much stuff brought up to the surface
so far so good.
it felt slightly hotter
his pores are so much smaller.
i left the mask on for a bit longer than recommended
because i love it so much
with just one use it made my skin feel so much softer
it is a little pricey
we spend so much on our make up
why not spend that much more on products that make our make up work smarter instead of harder
my face definitely looks a lot clearer
i gave a 4 star rating because it didn't get all the junk out of my face like i would've liked it to even after i left it on a little longer than suggested
after removing the mask my face did feel much
as much as i hate spending this much money on a mask
the longer i kept it on
i love el so much i will use it the rest of my life
so as someone who atcually has used quite a lot of el products
i actually like this soap even more than the black one
it would make it easier for applying make-up
my skin looks so much better
i feel better without make up.
i never buy soaps that cost this much
it still works just as well.
nothing has worked better
i go out without makeup more
my pores look so much cleaner/smaller
i may have used to much
dried my skin a little but thats usual for me.
i couldn't be happier
definitely a 5-star product if it wasn't so expensive
still have more than half of it left
the bar also lasts a really long time
a little of soap goes a long way.
my dark spots are getting lighter.
my skin becomes much more smooth and clean!
sometimes still get a breakout
the bar also goes a very long way.
i am glad sephora starts to carry more
i just wish they made a smaller bar
or that it were cheaper because it's just a lot to shell out for a bar of soap
this works so well for my skin.
which was way less than i expected
its part of the extra range so has all the good stuff for your skin as well
still not too much for my combination skin
my bottles usually last me for about a year because a little goes a long way
i finally got my so to use something better than drugstore
it was too strong for his skin
and works even better than it smells!
looks even shinier than usual
you only need a little.
just a bit takes you a long way.
a little goes a long way
this product is in no way harsh for my skin
clear face wash gel- works well with a clairsonic- a little goes a long way
my skin has never looked better
something less potent in the am
just made my acne even worse
a little goes a long way
so far so good with texture
a little goes a really long way!
a little bit of them product goes a long way
definitely can be a bit too drying for everyday use
i couldn't be happier
so yes sometimes it might feel a little dry after
couldn't wait to buy more after how great my skin started to look
my complexion appears much smoother with less dark spots
a little goes a very long way
a little goes a long way
it does have a little bit of a tight feeling
even long term i am seeing less breakouts
just a little bit of product goes a long way
at first i was hesitant on spending that much money on a cleanser
a little goes a long way--i'm still getting used to that
what i like about it is the bottle lasts a long time
use something else more mild in the mornings
i've used for just 5 days so far.
now that i've switched to this my skin feels so much better
the few little wrinkles i have under my eyes look so much better too
have never found anything better
at any other time of year it would be too drying.
so far so good.
i love this so much!
clarity is getting better
more even in skin tone
not painful- more like a tingle
i no longer experience that side effect
my dark circles are just getting worse
as long as it works
after one application his eyes are better
you'd get more stars if you dropped the price
the dar circles will be much better
my eyes haven't looked better in years!
can only do so much with genetics however i saw a big difference
you need a very little bit
those that couldn't get rid of the beads used too much
is less expensive i would change
none helped as much as this
my eyes are a little hollow
a little goes a very long way
it works better than anything else i've tried
with more than 1 product
this product seems to be helping a little
i hate this product isn't getting better reviews.
there is only so much that can be done
especially well on those from lack of sleep
they seem to be showing more
it is way better than hylexin
i must say this has worked far better for me than the hylexin
it works far better than hylexin.
they actually looked better
the more i use it the more the dark circles become brighter
the little micro-balls are a little odd at first
it is a little pricey
don't care for them very much
have not had much luck with other products.
too much pressure is needed to breakup those little biospeheres
as far as long term lightening of circles
the silver balls do take a little getting use to
a little goes a long way
when cleansers generally last me much longer
i could tell that if i used it more often
my skin feels and looks so much better.
i swear it has changed my skin for the better.
makes my skin seem brighter
you used way too much, try more water!
though they are better
my skin has never looked more clear
has actual little leaves in it
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way with this stuff as well so not even a full pump is needed each time
the oilyon my skin is less
that the products are a little pricey
not too hard on the face
now i have even better skin than before.
since i started using glamglow products it has help so much
the price is a little much
spend a little more time lathering it
it is certainly smoother
so my face is already slightly wet
i noticed how much better this cleansed off my makeup
i find it to be more effective that way.
i no longer have it because of this product
my face can get so gross when i'm stressed which happens often now as i try more
i love this so much!
i loved this product so much that i had to share
it just feels overall healthier
it actually minimizes pores which i've had a hard time finding a product that actually works this well for
i personally think there are better cleansers / exfoliaters for lower price
a lot better than the mask
i feel like the supercleanse cleanse my face much better
a little goes a long way
loved it so much
in the few days of trying it i noticed my skin to be so much brighter
as much as i loved the mask
i would love to try more glamglow product!
my skin care now works better
youthcleanse can be a little messy to use
however i have a lot of other great cleansers that are $10 cheaper
so far so good, loving this cleanser :d
my face has never looked better
it takes off makeup so well
a teeny bit goes a long way
i hope it never ever ever goes away because my face will be so much worse off
the bottle is very big for the price too!
that could be from so more different aspects
even though i still have breakouts
it is even worse than usual since i decided to try to be cute
the texture has been rough looking no matter what i do
so far so good!
softens it so so much
it helps so much
it appears much more even after using it consistently
i love the results so much with glamglow that i look forward to it now
using this in the morning that i feel the need for more "boost"
this bottle lasts a very long time.
i still like this one better
the directions were a little confusing at first
a little smell but it will go away.
that way it foams up better
my skin has never looked better
my makeup sits so much better
then add a little more water to it to make it foamier
the bottle seems a little pricey
my skin just looks so much healthier
which looks a lot better when putting foundation on
it is those little luxe things that mean so much.
the consistency is so much like its matching mask counterpart that i even would use it as a mask
it may be too much moisture
no matter how much facial cream i put on it nothing helped
i don't spend more than $10 on skin care products
i just recommend not to use too much of this product at once
wish the price was a little cheaper.
i wished it lasted longer too.
this is my 2nd bottle but it lasts so long.
my skin has never looked better
my face has never looked better
i will admit the i prefer this much more then the mask version
my skin feels better than it ever has
also a little bit goes a long way!
the lather is way richer than the others
a little goes a long way
this is by far
my skin has never looked healthier or smoother
i got bullied in school for having dark eye bags never thought a product can help with that this much
even the really expensive stuff
this is so far the only eye creme that gives me adequate moisture
a little goes a long way too :)
it goes on smoother
no more crows feet.
i know i need to sleep more
a little bit of this goes a long way
feels like some way more expensive creams smell
so far i'm loving this moisturiser.
it's richer than i'm used to
my eyes look less crepy than before
less dull than it was before
it still does seem to help slightly with this
a little bit goes a long way with this stuff.
i needed a little more help
it makes under my eyes a little brighter
honestly my acne seems to have gotten noticeably better as well
if only the price wasn't so high for a little amount
this has helped all of those so much
i do think that it has helped even out my skin tone as well
hence why itit'ss getting 4/5 stars
this absorbs so much better than other serums i have used
it's amazing how much result i am getting from such a lightweight product
every day i am amazed that two little pumps or two little drops are enough
it actually helped with the redness quite a bit
in one day my face feels fresher
more hydrated than after any other product i have ever tried
since using this my oils don't break through my foundation as much
you don't need very much
it does play quite nicely with foundations that otherwise may have been drying on skin
a little product goes a long way
it works quite well.
also my foundation laid so much better
looked better all day
looks so much softer
i couldn't be happier
healthy looking than ever before
i feel like it helps make the foundations even better
i no longer liked the consistency
i really like it so far
i love this one so much better
and of course, the price is much better.
my only wish is that it would come in a smaller size so that it's more convenient for traveling
this lasts me for much longer than i would have ever expected
in the winter i do need some more help
love using this as it works so well while feeling so luxurious at the same time
at least it doesn't make it worse
this cleansing oil is way better than most in that it's lightweight
a little goes a long way
my life has changed for the better ever since
you get more in the bottle
got is as an extra in one of the little bags
depending on how much i have on
so you can imagine that i was super hesitant to put more oil on my skin
the shea definitely makes my skin tone look more even
one pump was more than enough to remove it all without any effort
this product may seem a little pricey
even longer if just used as a wash
a pump goes a long way.
one pump is more than enough for my whole face.
i love this cleanser so much!
a little goes a long way
love it so far
my skin has never looked better.
a little bit goes a long way
it's a little thinner so the oil spreads easier.
on certain days it's a little much
only need a little bit of it
this is definitely one of the better ones
s even feel softer after using it
it still stings my eyes a little
works well on the rest of the face, though.
it works 10x better that way.
i liked this product far better
i actually like it better.
i don't think i could ever use other cleansing oils other than this one even if other ones work as well as this
my usual cleanser was drying it out too much
my face has never felt more clean
soooo much better than the boscia one
only need a little bit
so far i haven't really seen a difference in my skin at all
the josie maran one to see which you like better
my skin is much less irritated
my makeup is going on more smoothly now.
nothing removes my makeup better
which looks much better than it has in a long time
so many products break her out
i put over makeup sometimes at end of day to look less tired
my makeup goes on smoother, too!
more often than not i only really use this in my t-zone
make it last longer
this product has not made it worse
it has really changed my skin for the better.
no more rd bumps, yeah!
all around more easy to deal with
a deeper clean at night work best for me
wanted to start taking better care of my skin
it just comes off easier.
a little bit can go a long way.
i put a little bit on my cotten ball
it has never looked better
i need to use it a little longer to have a better decision
wished the bottle was bigger.
when i do use regularly my skin tone is more even
i enjoy quite a few perricone products
usually likes something initially
unfortunately, it began burning- it hurt so much.
it hurt that much.
its cleaner than ever
it makes everything worse
this- perricone is much better
very easy to blend and a little goes a long way.
still want to even out my skin tone
a little goes a long way
in no way as much as before i started using this
or need that much coverage
a little goes a long way.
make it look like i had a tad bit more color
a little goes a long way
it goes well with makeup too.
goes on so light-
i actually like this moisturizer far better
it feels better on the skin
s-down better than any others
better than the most expensive.
foundation apply even better than before
i don't feel like it made my skin more oily than usual
a bit more at night
people guess that i am 15 years less than my 68 years
this creme is much more than i expacted.
i never thought that creme can do more than moisturazing
my skin tone is more even
i stay out of the sun as much as i can
it's a little bit out of my price range
my skin looks much much brighter and very even.
you're probably using too much
it might have been that i needed to try it for longer as it was an insider reward
actually got it twice because i loved it so much
plumped it a little bit
i don't have too many fine lines
loved it so much that i went back for more
it seems to work better when you give it a chance to penetrate your skin fully
my skin looks a little smoother
a little goes a long way
so far so good.
just better without the irritation
more than that my entire face has changed
more even in tone
i noticed my face is more clearer without most of old build-ups for the 10-day challenge
this one i had high hopes for too!
a little goes a long way
my skin looked more even toned
healthier than it has looked in over 5 years
hype often deters me rather than intrigues me
they tend to linger for a long time
a few very old spots have lightened considerably in a very short period of time
only a little bit is needed
i know the price looks a little intimidating
my skin hasn't ever looked better.
it's way more even
maybe when i have more wrinkles ...
my face felt much better
i can look forward to even better skin in the future
the price is a little high
it is a bit pricey but a little goes a long way.
i do think that it helped heal some acne scabs much quicker than normal
not made it worse
since the very first day my face is smoother
no longer in my budget i have been searching for something that works at a better price point
this did not make it any more oily than usual
this is the first product that i have used that has actually improved the way my skin feels as well as looks
a little goes a long way i have not found that is has an oder at all
see how it does long-term
so far love it.
so there may be a more natural smell
it's even better than i thought it would be
see it only gets better with time
quite a few have gone back lately
better than it ever has
of which i have a lot of
i kind of expected more
is one of the things i most like about this product
i wanted something i could use every day for a brighter fresher complexion
i do not leave this mask on for more than 3-5 mins per the instructions
using it as a mask can be a little trickier
left it on for a little longer than you probably should
my skin become more better
make up only looks better!
even better when i use a couple times a week
no other product has been more gentle
still gets the job done
ended up applying too much
so might take more than just a splash of water to remove it
you can have brighter skin
much more so than i feel with clay masks
notice my makeup looks better
although the price is a little much
my skin looks nicer already
as far as i can tell from the ingredients
if you already have a deep cyst it won't really help much
it does tend to leap out of the jar so careful opening it for the first few times
a little goes a long way
i think it works better when applied in the morning
i liked how a little product goes a long way
this works so well as a spot treatment
love it at night too.
clear skin so used this as a spot treatment when i was having some bumps
something stronger or cheaper
its never looked better
probably skin balancing is a bit tardy
a little of this stuff goes a long way!
a little definitely goes a long way
no surprise that this little jar packs a punch especially since only shiseido products make up my skin's fleet
it was a lot smaller than i expected when it arrived
it was a lot smaller than i thought
just a little on day
i very much like his product
red skin that was making me look older than 35
a little bit goes a long way with this.
i no longer need makeup
i loved it so much
or maybe the light is reflecting better to make me believe that
a little goes a long way
had a more even tone
even with little time
since using this i have noticed my makeup goes on so much smoother
not quite as much as dior
my skin looks more even and brighter.
a little too heavy for daytime use
this one is much less harsh than others
since it feels like i'm wasting too much product
the pre-measured doses is helpful since it can be hard to know exactly how much of a product you will need
a little goes a long way
i feel like it is gentle enough to use it 1-2 extra times than an average exfoliator
my only complaint is that it can be a little messy
a little goes a long way!
i usually ad a little more water to loosen it up
using this product with an oil probably helped from keeping the product being too drying
a little goes a long way
even with good primer+foundation, i still cake.
it takes a bit of getting used to
a little goes a long way
it can be a tad messy to deal with
i feel as if it might be a little too scratchy for my skin
it also makes my foundation look so much better on my skin
i always try cheaper ones
if it feels too rough
there is still enough for probably two more uses since a little goes a long way
i find it a bit much
so far i really like it
my skin tone seems more even
it is gritty without being too rough
i couldn't believe how long it lasted for how often i use it
a little bit of this product goes a long way.
a little goes a long way.
looks better than it has in a long time
the good thing about it is that you can pretty much adjust the intensity by hoe much liquid you add
its better than anything else i have used.
little did i know how much more difficult adult acne would be
still have more than half left
it will definitely last much longer than the liquid exfoliator i was using before
a smaller hole would be helpful because it's difficult to control how much you pour
because i love this product so much
it was much easier to use with a cleansing oil
i also realized i may have put too much into my palms to mix
i think my skin looks better today the day after using it
you can use as much or as little as you want.
bam a lot more than normal came out
some exfoliators are too much for me
my makeup applied so much better afterwards.
you use so little
you can add more or less if you want it to be more abrasive
i found it to be a little more abrasive when using with just water
i prefer this to a much more expensive exfoliator i've been using for years
my skin has never been so smooth
a little goes a long way
just a bit of water to make it smoother to apply
my skin is so much brighter
it is a little hard to get used to the powder form
it actually made my face less red
love it so much!
so far i really like this.
well, maybe when i was a baby:) but.
i love this so so much!
this is a way better product than the kate somerville exfolikate
since using this line my skin is so much softer
it is a little pricey
i don't know how much it has done for fine lines
my skin generally looked better
a little goes a long way.
very rarely do i buy something twice
more like a cream i guess?
all is good so far
i do notice my skin tone is more even
could probably be even more of a hit without the fragrance
a small drop goes a very long way.
my skin has been looking more
were as tight as they'd ever been
everyday my skin looks a little better
other than i keep thinking
"my skin looks better" each day i use it
skin just looks a little tighter.
have found that my skin feels so much softer
my skin tone is a lot more even as well as some very fine lines have faded
this seems to have helped even that out to the point i no longer need to wear foundation to cover it up
a bottle lasts a long time since a little goes a long way
so far this has worked amazingly on my transitioning skin as we go from winter to spring in ny
my skin has improved so much!
it feels thicker than i originally thought it would be so this is great for people with dry skin
my pores are so much smaller
thought maybe i would see better results
i feel like my skin has been more balanced
i love this product so much
after using this product i'm starting to think differently
the more matte the better for me
i love the smell so much
i doubt they get too far
my skin felt softer than it ever had before
i get little oil bumps often
i think this visionnaire is even better
my skin has never felt better!!
to save myself from spending so much money
people guess me to be 15 years younger than i am.
my skin has never looked better!
my skin tone looks more even.
i looked younger, healthier, and brighter!
a little goes a long way
or doing a lot more for my skin than just wearing a mask
even better than right after a facial!
my skin felt much softer after the first use
i love this mask so far.
every clay mask i've ever tried only made it worse
my pores are actually getting tighter
only giving it 4 stars because of how expensive it is
i like it even better than skinceuticals.
my makeup even stays on better
my skin is much more firm
my skin is brighter and my pores are smaller too.
i like this so much
just remember, a little goes a long way.
the tone is much more even
my melasma does look much better
has faded quite a bit
i feel much better about my face
non seemed to work without making my skin react badly
my friends have notice that my skin has changed so much they even thought i may have had botox
although i don't have much to begin with
'd rather use more now when i can still get the benefits
i like it so far.
i've not seen better results over time.
still difference is night
i couldn't be happier
after 2 weeks i saw better skin texture than i even thought possible
seems to be more tone
it looks more even
my skin looks more even-toned
a little goes a long way.
by far this is the best yes it takes about 3 weeks to see results
my eyes look so much better
had pretty much given up as i have tried so many that claim to be firming
they are definitely smoother
definitely on the more of oily side
not too heavy on the face
i would say this one is a little more hydrating
the bobbi brown blends in a little easier.
my skin is a little less oily than it should be for this
my skin has never looked better.
not as much as usual
i loves this so much!
i even like it better than the benefit pore product that i have used for several years now
my skin has become drier the longer i live here
not too big of a deal
it was a little smoother
no more burning at all.
love it equally, if not more than the original.
i can deffinatly say i'm glad i spent the money on this even though i couldnt find more than just a few reviews
stung a little bit the very first time i used it
i even use sometimes at night just because of the way it makes my skin look
not too heavy, just right.
my only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that it can leave my skin looking a little
even clearer than ever
my skin has never looked better
i like it better than the original.
however it will last a long time since a little goes a long way
i love that a little bit goes a very long way.
it is a little expensive
it felt a little bit too much like sunscreen for me
it overshadowed what i like about the normal formula
my skin couldn't be better
you need very little for each eye because a little can go a long way as many have said
it stings kind of badly
it also has become a little oily.
a little goes a long way
i tried a lot- most of them were a lot more expensive
lately they have looked more dry
and it lasts forever because it takes so little.
i love this eye cream so far
it really only stings a little
seems to be working well
makes make up application so much easier in the morning
while not being too heavy
don't have to use as much
so far i love the whole line!
stretching the area even more
a little bit goes a long way.
i am curious to see after using it longer if it brightens
the product goes a long way
a little goes a very long way
4 stars because if you apply too much product it can ball up
there was a little learning curve.
way less than i've paid for other eye creams in the past
a little goes a long way.
you only need a little bit
my eyelids seem smoother which makes putting the make up on easier
it would be nice if the container were bigger
yet a little bit of it goes a long way
it seems to be a good product so far
haven't been using much product
a little goes a long way.
i will definitely be buying more.
just wish the container was bigger.
a little goes a long way
she suggested this because it works faster
a little goes a long way.
my face looks better
a little of this goes a long way
the few sun spots i have look a little lighter
i've used this for a little less than a month
at first it feels like it might be rich
it is way better than using it alone
i am in love with everything so far in genius white too
just keeps getting better with time
just add a little more moisture
i can clean my face more because i was massaging it more
i really like it so far!
my skin looks better with no foundation than it does even with my holy grail foundation
you have to be careful not to much
no more breakouts as well
after a few months when my blemishes still wouldn't go away no matter how many products i used
noticed my skin looks way better when using this consistently
unfortunately it made me breakout more
gave it a 7 day try w/ extremely tiny amnt still no go
just in an all around better condition
because i need so little about 2-3 times a week
more plump every morning
a little goes a long way
using this every night for me seems to make my skin react less to the product
since products work differently from 20's to 40's
it works so well that even my husb
i tend to be a little heavy h
a little goes a long way
my complexion has never been better.
the price is a bit much
it is expensive as all get out
my skin has never looked smoother or brighter
my favorite part- i have had much fewer breakouts
is clearer than it has been in a long time
after giving it a fair shot i noticed how much better my skin was
i couldn't be happier with this.
the smell took a little getting accustomed to
changed it for the way much better
a little goes a long way so keep that in mind when you see the bottle
as far as wrinkles i'm not sure
my skin seems to be a little too sensitive for anything more
especially because i never thought oil could actually help that much
my skin seems more even
pretty much as soon as i turned 30 (eek!)
my complexion is more even
it became more bearable each night
i love this product so much!
although it is on the pricier side
feels a lot more fresh
my skin is more even toned
it does work well however i have 2 issues even though i gave it 5 stars
a little goes a long way
but, so far, so good!
my skin's texture is much more even
a little goes a very long way
skin is brighter, softer and more even toned.
see if it still shows
if my skin is having some trouble
to heal much faster than normal
texture is more even
a little goes a long way
this has helped sooo much
t has been extra tough to get rid of
my texture is better than ever
even said my skin is softer then usual
not that i have much
some of my deeper scaring
texture is going to take a bit longer
it just made my tone much more even in one use
a little goes a long way
do not use a lot or you will find that sticky texture some people complain about take little by little
so a little goes a long way
not as dull as before
i really like the pump it has because you have great control over how much product you want out unlike other pumps that just squirt out the same amount every time or make it very difficult to pump just a little out
nonetheless this serum works for me so far
they all react so differently to different skin care products
my skin looked so much better!
it dispenses just as much as you need
the texture of my skin is a lot more even
one of the few products that actually delivers what its supposed too
my skin keeps getting better
better with every use
look so much more youthful
i can't believe how much my skin has improved in such a little time
i loved it so much i spent more than i usually do on this type of product
so this goes a long way
have felt way more moisture
it goes a long way
no product has ever done that
mpressed by how a little goes a long way
there's usually even a little extra to move down my neck
this is so far
my pores have gotten so much smaller
my skin is now a lot brighter
my marks have healed a lot quicker than they used to
expensive medication has done nothing all this time
try these products-they are a little pricey
less irritated than before
it sinks in so well and its not heavy.
i feel like using less i wouldn't always get an even mix of the little beads that contain the active ingredients
it made it a lot easier
my skin has never felt better
my skin is much brighter
my skin has never felt better.
my skinone was more even
i am much more comfortable walking around without make up or with very little
technique to no avail here too
the condition of my skin is so much better now that a lot of friends
family ask me what i have been doing differently as they notice how smooth
my skin just is better
so far it is working wonders
now i seldom breakout even though i'm still pregnant
my skin has never looked better
much better than the prescription creams
love it so much
my skin looks so much better after i have used this product
my skin has never felt softer or felt better!
a little bit of this stuff goes a long way!
lasts a very long time.
i did have a tight feeling for about a week
in a month, an even bigger improvement.
it lasts quite a while
directions encourage every other day use if it dries out skin too much
my skin keeps getting better
has given my face a more healthy look
i like this so much more than i thought i would.
as always though wish it was a tad cheaper
i couldn't be happier with this product
i feel much firmer skin around my mouth
now i have a smoother
so far so good
i do like it a lot but it is spendy.
i hardly break out now
overall my skin is so even toned that now i don't even wear foundation
at a much higher price
no one was more surprised than me.
i look younger without it
it makes it more even
it's pricy but a little goes a long way!
my face has never felt better
my skin feels so much smoother.
smoother and more even skin.
well they look so much smaller
if my skin looks this much better after only one month
after i drink too much wine
it no longer works as well
leave them on for better benefits
my skin is smoother, more even tone and brighter.
i will admit that i have only used this a few nights so far
a little goes a long way
ever since i started using this product my face is a lot more hydrated
this stuff works better than any daily treatment i've ever used
deep lines are slowly getting better
my skin looks way better that it did in my 20s
it absorbs well and a little goes a long way!
which is what i have as well
it looks younger and smoother.
so far, so good!
other than that i love it.
my face was more even
so far so good.. love this serum.
well, this one is it!
they've all had their downsides
this one does more than help though
can already see my skin is brighter
it finally is becoming a more smooth texture
my pores are so much more clear
so something that primes
a little goes a long way
light i barely feel it
it takes a few times to get how to put it on- it has almost a gel like feel
them pump some more
i think they may be using too much then
i've paid more for things that i don't like as much
because i love this product so much
a little goes a long way with this product
it did pill up a little bit
a little goes a long way which is nice.
a little on the pricier side
especially when your skin starts to look more smooth
makes my make up last longer
reading around a little bit
if you rub it too much
my only complaints are that it goes too quickly
this is light but not too light.
it's a bit pricier than some products
a little goes a long way
my makeup has never looked better
my only concern with this product is you use very little of it which means you're probably not getting nearly as much spf protection as you should be
because i have deeper skin
my makeup looked better
i still like it though.
just to get the last little bit
doing so much in such a light formula
primes better than any other
my skin tone looks so even after a month of use
it is a little price
i like how a little goes a long way
they are using way too much product
i know some users have commented that their makeup often "pills" if they use too much product
it tends to slightly to "pill" up a bit
keeps it there all day long
the price is a little steep for what you get
i've never had issues with the product flaking or rolling into little balls how some have said
i noticed if i use too much it pills a bit
my skin feels so much better and smoother.
it seems like there isn't much product
that being said, a little goes a long way...
just a little beat covers a long way your foundation
i noticed my makeup melted off much faster when using this as a primer
i hate it so so so so much
if this was less expensive i would wear this every day it just feels so nice on my skin
just hurts each little pump
i like this better
my foundation tend to break down a lot faster in my nose area
a little of this goes a long way
works well for pretty much any skin type.
4 stars only because it is a little pricey for the amount of product you get
my makeup looks flawless for a lot longer.
a little goes a long way
if this was just a bit less expensive it would have five stars
a little goes a long way
i couldn't be happier with it
i now longer worry about finishing powder because my face produces so much less oil
my normally very oily skin has definitely stopped producing so much oil
my t zone is considerably less oily
a little goes a very long way!
it's cheaper than a lot of other high end primers like smashbox for example
since using this with the red clay cleanser my oil has been so much better as well as the size of my pores
it helps my makeup last a bit longer while at the same time
some much needed mattifying
my makeup has lasted a lot longer
i feel that is only because some use too much
so far i love it.
i think there should be more for the price
it helps with that too
foundation is much quicker
easier in the mornings
this one was the only one that actually kept me matte pretty much all day long
my face is no longer greasy
while it does make my skin look slightly shinier at first
with this stuff a little goes a long away
my skin has not looked better.
a little goes a long way :
a little bit definitely goes a long way!
also as with most fab products a little goes a long way
i tried a little on my h
a little goes a long way
no more mid-day pat downs!
plus, a little goes a very long way!
thought to try something a little cheaper to regulate the oil
love this so much!
makes my makeup last that much longer
other primers are better at making my powder foundation last longer
this product works so well though
in my mind the more the better ha ha which is not the case with this product
it does work well
more even in tone
a little goes a long way.
it goes on a little greasy
think it works much better under my foundation
so much less often
love this product so much!
the roller clicks to dispense exactly how much to use- not too much
you have to be careful or else you will pump out too much
even better than philosophy which i dearly love.
so far so good.
well this is it!!!
discoloration better than anything i've tried in the past
the more i use it the better it gets.
a little big goes a long long way- a sample lasted me a week if not more using morning
a little goes a long way!
but i like this quick fix a lot.
this product is better than any high end br
i've re-stocked twice in a fairly predictable amount of time--a little goes a long way
t didn't go too quickly even though the pot is a little on the small side
i find i'm no longer sweating anywhere near as much as i used to
no more no less
not too much to be applied in the am
a little goes a long way.
little goes a long way.
i do find myself using a little more of this during night applications than i do with other moisturizers
if you use too little to try to keep it light
i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 due to wanting a little softer skin
i don't need to use as much primer or foundation
investing in great skin care far outweighs pinching pennies
don't need to use as much as with the lotiontypes
which is super important to me as i often cut my moisturizers with different treatment oils that will sometimes be a little intense on their own
not much product at all
a little too much during summer since i have combination shin
definitely more of a once in awhile cream or for the colder months
i love this more than clinique or lancome.
i've purchased it 3 times already bc of how much i love it
when i want a little coverage
too many bead up
if i could give it more than 5 stars i would!!
a little bit goes a long away
loved it so much
a little goes a long way!
a little goes a long way.
it might be better as a night cream
i am no longer peeling.
a little goes a long way.
he has no idea how much it costs or where i get it from
makes my makeup look better
you could easily spend a lot more
a little of this goes a long way--it's not very heavy
i am hoping there is something better that isn't so sticky
a little goes a long way as well
may use one of the lighter ones in the summer
a little goes a long way
i find it needs a little longer to sink into my skin
this makes it feel softer than a baby's bottom
my skin is noticeably more healthy looking
i think it's better than the tarts h20 because it's a little thicker meaning it keeps my skin hydrated for longer
i'll definitely be giving them more attention
no problems so far
it is really thick and a little goes a long way.
the only concern i have is that it might be too heavy for summer use
this does the job for way cheaper
i only use a little bit at a time, though.
it lathers up so much
i still have a lot of product left
a little goes a long way.
the toner was a bit too much for my skin
it's even better than it was before i started to break out
i like it better than the last few i've tried
those areas look better
a little goes a long way
a little definitely goes a long way.
i guess that it will be better for more normal skin than dry
a little bit of this goes a long way!
it lasts a very long time.
i love it so much!
a little bit goes a long way
makes me feel like i'm getting a deeper clean :
a little goes a long way!
you need just a little bit to wash face
a little harder to use with the clarisonic
true belif-er in all of the products i've used so far
i noticed my skin is more even
if you are having a hard time choosing a face cleaner
now i can tell that it has become way more moisturized
a little goes a long way
my skin feels better every time i use it!
with very little product
so much that it went up my nose
a very little foams up
leaves my face feeling more than clean
my skin has never felt better
i no longer feel that tight sensation
i couldn't be happier
you get so much product with this
it doesnt get nearly as oliy during the day therefore my makeuo is lastinf longer
looks quite fresh still at the end of the day
not too much or too little.
i think it reduced the size of my pores too.
you also get so much product
i still have more than a quarter of the bottle left
a half to two pumps is more than enough
you get so much product too
i don't think it had much other benefits than hydration
i've tried so many, that i've gotten discouraged.
two days of using this, and so far so good.
i learned very quickly that with this product a little goes a long way
now i can say that i have closer to normal skin after consistently using this product
healthier than ever before
i love this so much that i always have a new
a little goes a long way.
a little goes a long way
in fact makes my make up look better
it absorbs really quickly too!
light weight/ not greasy/hydrates as well as it says it does- a little goes a long way
loved it so much
it gets a bit too overwhelming
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way with this product
thanks to this i no longer look like a reptile.
a little goes a very long way
the other version of this is just too heavy for my skin
which is much shorter than typical moisturizers
much better at sinking into your skin
as soon as i'm done i'm definitely getting the bigger size
make you look 10 years younger-
it was so good it lasted for 2 applications
so far it's great
is also easy to layer on days where you need a bit more moisture
it is not too heavy for my skin
that is no longer a problem for me
a little goes a long way so the jar lasts me a good amount of time
little goes a long way
make me break out too
belif has helped my combination skin so much!
wish it was more cream based as it seems it evaporates during the night
$38 might seem really cheap compared too all the other br
i probably can go through 3 of these before going through other pricier skin care
i'd rather pay $90 for something else than these.
at first seemed to like that one a bit more
it's been less than a week
many pros: a little goes a very long way
a little goes a long way and it smells fresh.
i love this moisturizer so much!
a little goes a long way
after using it for a few weeks my pores seem more clogged than ever
also a little goes a long way
now that we're moving into the warmer
i've noticed that my skin looks a lot better than it did before
a little goes a long way.
i still have a good bit left
i've ordered 3 big jars so far
use this little wonder year round
my only gripe would be it takes quite a while for the product to soak in
of course so little product for the price
on about how much i love this product even though i haven't used this for even a month
it works so well
that might be because i can now use a much lighter daytime moisturizer
my makeup goes on much better
i would like it more if the packaging was different -- it would be much better in a pump
a little goes a long way.
seriously a little product goes a long way with this
i don't feel like my wrinkles are getting any smaller
it gave me so much relief throughout the whole day
my acne spots looks so much better when i use this mask
since there is so much product
very concentrated, so a little goes a long way.
i don't even have to use that much of it to get adequate hydration
my eye area has never looked better!
a little goes a long way
so far so good.
what i like best about this eye ream is that it is somewhat thick
i also like that the jar is bigger than the normal
i find belif to have amazing products that perform like much more expensive competitors
masks that would help a little bit
its much more even than it was before
definitely going to check out more from this company
i can't say that my skin tone is very much different so far
maybe with a few more months of use i'll start to see that change too?
they all either dried my face out too much or actually caused a breakout
they are so much lighter i actually feel okay going out without makeup on now
so hoping they will be even lighter by the time i'm done with it
a little lasts way longer .
now i think i'll use them no more
it's also heavily concentrated so a little goes a long way
no irritation so far.
makes it look very even rather than flaky
" which is a little misleading
and, my skin feels so much softer now!
also, a little of the mask goes a long way.
no more break outs
it might seem expensive at first
seriously, best mask i've tried so far.
if i could give more than 5 stars i would!
my skin looks clearer overall too.
my pores really do appear smaller
there is so much of this product that ive used this for about a year now
my skin looks clearer and feels so nice.
this product has had much
much more of an impact than many products i've tried which claim to do the same thing
all you need is a little bit
this seemed to work quite well with it
my face wash that i have been currently using is a little more drying
my skin feels so smooth too after using it!
i find that i like this one much better
you also only need to use one pump because a little goes a long way
also be aware that because it is an oil it can be a little messy
the oil is much lighter in consistency than the other cleansing oil i've tried which makes it easier to spread
having tried something a little cheaper
don't use too much you don't need to- a little goes a long way
get brighter as well
i know this eye treatment is meant for skin more mature than mine
i still have the beginning of crow's feet as well as fine
it makes you look so much younger
little goes a long way!
throughout the years i try different eye creams thinking they will be better- nope
i look less tired after use
also helps control how much you distri
a little goes a long way.
a little drop goes a long way
my under eyes are much brighter
they have aged me a lot faster.
so far this the only one that truly fades away the wrinkle that i have in between my eyebrows
more compliments over this simple eye cream than any other treatment i've ever used
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way
i can not believe how much better my skin looks since i have been using this product
all in all a nice average moisturizer that will make your skin look a little brighter
actually my skin has been much clearer
you get so much more product in the regular clinique moisturizer
a little goes a long way
maybe i didn´t try it too long
a little goes on long way
other than the look it gives you this is gives you a lot of moisture even for me
my face looks so much better every morning after using this product every night
i will definitely be buying more of this
i like this a lot for when i just want to add a little bit of extra moisture to my skin care routine
so on days when my skin is a bit drier i will go for a heavier oil
healthier than ever before
i couldn't be happier
a little goes a long way
when you're just indulging in too much product
my skin was more brighter
so better packaging would be a plus!
haven't even tried it on my face, too precious.
a little goes a long way with this product
i would like to be able to use it a bit more often that the suggested 2-3/week
maybe i just like the name "seaberry" too much.
they look better already.
doesn't stick around too much
more even skin tone
so haven't used it long enough to see its effect fullyno irritation
i needed something to give me skin just a little boost
love this, and a little goes a long way!
the bit added at night to my moisturizer has actually helped slow my oil production during the day
makeup looks so much better now during the day!
which i like too
my skin looks better than ever
eventually my skin gets better and healthier.
they seemed to be making my face even oilier
i love the versatility of this cleanser since you can control how much or how little oil you want to use depending on your skin that day
like it so far
my skin has not looked any better!
you are in control of how much mud
i love this cleanser so much
if the product wasn't so expensive
my skin has improved so much!
my skin hasn't looks better
i felt more refreshed than i ever felt after using a high end cleanser
my skin feels so much better
works well with the clarisonic too
my breakouts have pretty much disappeared
pump could be better
i even wear less make up
the only reason i didn't give the full 5 stars is because it is a tad bit drying
a little goes a long way
the pumps let out very little product
how much better could this cleanser be than your ordinary cleanser
this cleanser has improved my skin so much.
no more picking at my face nothing.
than go in with my clarisonic
the left much to be desired to say the least
i couldn't be happier
using this with the mask just made it that much better
brighter every time i use it
my face looks so much cleaner & healthier!
i suppose more packaging = less product in this case
it made me a little greasy
especially since a few drops go a very long way
a little goes a long way
the one little line i had under my eye, gone!
when i actually have mature skin
my skin has never looked better!
it is a little pricey
i'd say 2 or 3 drops is plenty for the whole face
i found this give me a more even application.
this one actually is quite subtle
i think it's too expensive for the amount of product you are getting though
3 drops is too much
it really does make my skin appear much smoother
the scent is much more light
a little goes a long way.
it feels less like a oil.
was so sad when i ran out just a few drops go so far lasts forever
this is a definitely more than i normally spend on a moisturizer
a little goes a long way
up close, however, it was looking a little tired.
if you use too much it will leave a white film
my fine lines look better
a little goes a long way
it did take a week or so for my skin to adjust because it is slightly drying
makes the oil slick situation worse
before even getting to foundation
love this so much
a little goes a long way
i just wish this was a teeny bit better
my foundation goes on well over it
it's a little bit on the pricier side
a little goes a long way--
not needing primer anymore has saved me enough money for this to be more than worth it
although it is costly, a little goes a long way!
plus it works even better than the murad oil control mattifier
a bit too spendy for me
on how many stars to give it
there hasn't been a primer thus far to keep my skin mate or control my oil
and a little goes a long way!!!
if you apply too much it can be tricky to blend in skin so this is a less is more product
smoother than ever before
much better than genius
any reviewers who say this leaves a residue are using way too much
just wish i could get more for less
if i found something similar or better
i also love that a little goes a long way with this moisturizer
even makes my foundation a bit patchy as well
a little goes a long way
i like the smell of the 5 in 1 better
a little goes a long way
i like it better than alot of the fancy stuff.
i couldn't be happier
also, don't use too much.
there is still a little bit of white cast after application
so far so good
the problem is that i was using way too much at once
a little bit goes a very long way!
however for me is was rather heavy
so far it hasn't at all
second how little product you are actually receiving for how much it costs
or at least change the squeeze bottle into a jar so you have more control of how much you are using
it takes a little effort to rub it in
i wish it was a little bit cheaper
a little goes a long way
just got this but so far i really like it.
so far it feels great.
feels more like a gel rather than a cream
she loves it just as much
other than that it is amazing
which she couldn't say much other than it is a good br
i even look a lot better on camera
i will definitely be buying more.
it has helped the texture of my skin so much
my only complaint is that my skin is left a little red for a bit after i use it
my skin look so so much more healthy.
as long as it gets the job done
it does the job just as well as glamglow
couldn't ask for better at a better price point
it did tingle a little bit at first
so much cheaper than the big name br
it's still much better than before
with very little to expect from it
that it burns a little bit
it still felt less oily which i appreciate
it is messy though
maybe even smaller than half
my pores looks clean and so much smaller!
i will say i like the glamglow mask a little bit more
i wish it were just a bit smoother
my acne has really faded out as well
i've tried a lot of higher end masks
even better than many of them
my skin has been maintained rather well
but this is better.
because this product really is better than the br
plus you get so much more product
it makes my pores look much smaller
overall my skin looks much brighter
my pores have gotten even better!
the best thing is how much product there is.
it makes your face look clearer
i do find my face a little more matte
for less than half the price
this product dries my skin out too much
better in my opinion
then it will go away quicker then usual
i am giving 4 stars as this is the only sephora mask i've tried so far
this mask comes with so much product for only $25
of course if you have more cystic acne like me it will take a little bit longer
for the most part though this does everything it says it will
i still have a lot left
i love this mask so far
not much has worked in the past to clear them up
my skin looks better than ever
this stuff really works better than any other mask i've ever tried
this does everything and more.
this did tingle a little bit
it is a lot less money
i find this to work 20x better
wouldn't use it more than once a week
it seems to even out my skin tone as well
i love this so much!
my skin is already looking better
i love this so much.
my pores have reduced so much
you get so much more product
it gets a little more glowy
i wish it was slightly better are purifying the pores or build up
i love how this mask works so quickly
this is a so so product.
i did leave on longer than said
spread it around my face the product is suppose to sit for no more than 3 minutes or else your skin starts drinking it up
i think twice a week will deliver results faster
now that i use it about once a week for months now my skin looks much prettier
how little of it i had to use
i waste too much product trying to cover my whole face
so far i love it
it's just as good if not better.
i used 2 pumps and it seemed like too much.
well it is gone.
there is too much product
there is too much product in the capsules.
a pump bottle or tube would be so much better.
rather than feeling like s
it goes a long way too
my skin was softer than ever
if you use too little product you won't get the maximum benefit
which is why it more than likely already comes pre-measured for you
not a lot of warming action though.
once i'm in it's a lot warmer than following the instructions
my face has such little acne after i started using it
i still need to buy it more often than i'd like to
in the beginning i was a bit hesitant about purchasing this as it is quite costly where i live
a little goes a long way
this product has definitely made my life so much easier
i am 37 and my skin has never looked better.
now it's so much more even
much lighter than the caudalie
my scars are lighter than ever all in less than a month
feels so much better
my pores are much smaller as well.
seeing as to how many oils i've tried to help it
you need very little product so the sample has lasted me a full week
with less than a week's use
i can't say that it made my skin look any brighter or vibrant compared to how it normally looks when i put on any other night cream
so the recommended 3-5 drops is just enough
overnight i swear my skin looks more rejuvenated than ever
more even in tone
i find i usually need almost twice as much in order to get the drier patches between my eyebrows
around my mouth feeling more normal
a little went a long way
my skin is better than it ever has been.
my skin looks more even
not sure if that's fair for me to rate it less than 5 as i have not used it more than that
my skin had an overall more even tone
mostly because it's the same amount of product for way less
my face actually looked brighter
so far i'm loving it
it absorbs so much faster than any other oil i've tried which is a huge plus for me
even though i was extra careful anyway
a little goes a long way
probably one of the more pricier items that origins has
no longer had a ruddy look
i've tried so many oils
a little of it goes a long way
the original night-a-mins cream works much better
i feel like this is more than make up
so far it has been a great oil
a little goes a long way.
i loved it that much
the price tag can be a little daunting
let it breathe a little bit
i would purchase it if it was a little cheaper.
so far i'm in love
it did feel a little tight after about an hour
my skin was so even
my skin tone is more even
my makeup went on so much smoother as did all my other products
<3 it so so much.
my skin looked more even and brighter.
when it was removed my skin looked so much better
skins look more even
my skin has never looked better
felt so much better
a little does go a long way with this one
i am trying to be much more diligent about skin care
i don't mind the rose scent too much because it works great
a little goes a long way
you're using too much
a little goes a long way
i tell my clients that a little goes a long way.
which to me means money well spent
i couldn't be happier with it
you just have to use waay less
even the little acne i get is calmed down.
this moisturizer leaves my skin softer than anything i've ever tried
it feels a little thick at first
skin looks and feels better by the next morning.
a little goes a long way!
the price is a bit too high for me right now
you shouldn't use too much though because it is quite thick
my skin has never looked better
a little goes a long way
if i was feeling a bit drier i just use it as a primer for a heavier cream
so far i'm loving the combination.
i would never normally purchase any type of skin product much less one this expensive
so far it is my holy grail!!!!
it has made my face much softer
it helps that a little goes a long way
i love this stuff so far.
i do not have a lot of extra money so for me to spend near 30$ on a cream it had better be good
it contains too much fragrance.
when i used this product it did sting a little bit
they are a little pricey
a little goes a long way.
wasn't expecting toolkit it too much
this made them feel more comfortable
i like this product very much.
it was slightly difficult to tell if it was all washed off
wake up with much clearer skin
even though that might have made yesterday's job easier
can now visibly see that my skin is even better than before
my makeup applied so much better after using this
my skin is a lot smoother
a little goes a long way
which i feel is a stronger
my skin texture looked so much better
i've never seen my face so pore-less!
i love it so much!
i could tell my pores looked tighter, as well.
my skin has never been better
bonus.. a little goes a long way !
most importantly it does what it claims
my pores look better
my skin is so much smoother after using this
could not be happier
the product does go a long way
as you do not need as much as other masques
i couldn't be happier
feels so much better
leaves your face feeling tighter as well as more refreshed
so don’t keep it on for too long
only bad thing is having to use so much product for the whole face
my face has never looked better.
my skin looked much brighter after each use
i leave this on for a bit longer than it calls for
a little of this mask goes an extremely long way!
i love this product so much.
i like this one so much better since its cheaper
my skin felt better
which feels even better in my hot
i wouldn't normally spend this much money on a mask
consequently i'm very careful about what sort of masks i use- so many samples have ended with days of extra cover up
this is way better
they looked smaller than ever after using this
this product is a little pricy
a little goes a long way
it really draws out any pimples that i have cropping up to a head so they go away faster
this mask works well so far.
little bumps under the skin
pores looking a little tighter
much much better than the glamglow supermud clearing treatment
and each time i use it it gets better.
i usually leave it on a little longer about 15 minutes
it just happens to clean better that way.
my makeup looked way better
you can wear this as a moisturizer rather than mask as well
my skin tone looks more even
i wish they had better instructions on how much product you need
i couldn't be happier.
my fine lines are much softer.
even if you use very little
i've noticed that they fade a lot faster
it's been doing a good job so far
i couldn't be happier with it!
it did not impress me more than other charcoal masks
love this so much!
do not let it on more than 5 minutes because anything longer could cause you to break out
i think this may work even better than the other ones
as the consistency is quite thin i need to layer it a lot
my skin was much smoother in the morning
my pores are so much smaller!
i wanted to try this mask not so much for the pore refining
it's much more even after using the mask.
a little goes a long way.
also softer than i think it has felt in years
was no longer leaking
it might be even better
definitely too drying for me to use more than once a week
it's easier to get off
it is worth it to make your face much cleaner
huge pores just make me look even worse
i've learned that the longer i leave it on the better it feels after coming off
found it better that way
so far has not gotten rid of my blackheads
so far im still loving it!
a little really does go a long way.
is more even toned
a little goes a long way
skin has never looked better
my skin just looked brighter
product goes a long way.
found it was too much oil for my skin
more than enough to cover my face
my skin needs it badly.
so far in my whole life i have ever found anything this hydrating
as a wash off mask, not so much.
is more even toned
my skin is just more healthy feeling in general
and a little goes a very lon way.
softer than it has in awhile
first of all, a little goes a long way.
even into the next morning my skin felt residually softer
used this way, you need very little.
a little goes a long way
skii for years bur wanted something in a better price point
at a better price point
the tiniest bit goes a long way.
my skin seems always craving for more
my skin looked plumper than usual
my complexion is much more even
the downside is that it's only good for 6 months
just not as well as on the eyes
tried this instead and like it even better.
i don't use much make-up
a little goes a long way!
sometime i have to wipe a little harder on my eyes
a little goes a long way.
i love it so much i have started buying their other products too
as with everyone i thought that cleansing with oil would only cause me to break out more
since i started using double cleansing my face has never felt better
seems like it will last a while as well
only a little is needed
the only thing is that i wish it was a bigger jar like it cosmetics
a little project goes a long way
a little goes a long way.
other than that, i love it!
a little goes a long way.
(it seems more like a oil in a gel form to me.)
has definitely become a staple.
a little goes a long way.
a little goes a long way
not as much as i usually do
but a little bit goes a very long way.
i've enjoyed using this one so far
you only need a little bit
this is better than the joise maran
a little goes a long way
i've only been using it 2 weeks, so far so great!
my face is no longer dry, and i'm so happy :)
a little bit goes a long way with this oil
a little goes a long way
it may be a bit strong to some people
this product needs more attention
this on has a lighter texture that seems to work a bit better
this is much nicer
this is so much better
too much or too little will cause the balm to leave a heavy residue on your face
a little goes a long way
overall i find this to be a much better cleanser
does everything it claims and more!
will look a tad masky for about an hour
seriously my face/makeup looks better the longer i have this on without shine
since the price is a little high for just an everyday face scrub
i still think i need more hydration
a little goes a long way
my eyes do look better than before i started using this product
wrinkles are much better
unfortunately it dried my under eye area making it look even worse
the dark circles were much lighter
no longer see bags under my eyes
after that month or so though i felt my skin was a tad more tight than before so maybe i only needed it for when i have breakouts
for a stick i found it a little messy to use.
it'd be easier if it was in a bottle
it also doesn't last very long too.
i love the formula so much i now use it on my whole face
my pores look smaller too
i like that i can take a little bit
this product made my skin look better than it ever has in the past
as it tends to get a little too soft if it gets too wet
the only reason i don't give 5 starts is because it is slightly messy
this makes it so much better
as i have heard this can sometimes be too harsh
you can noticeably see the difference just after one use
my pores are already a little smaller!
also don't twist it too much because you will lose product
for the price as well, you get a lot.
this has removed them a lot better
don't use too much water
feel like i'm getting deeper into my pores
my skin has never looked better
the toplines are: a little goes a long way
i love this so much.
my skin in conjunction with other products never looked better
have struggled to find the right skin care routine for a very long time
i find this stick dries it out a bit too much
i think it would be much better just as a bar of soap like the drunk elephant bar
as i find that way less than that covers my skin
a little bit goes a long way
a little goes a long way.
i pretty much use it only at night after a day of wearing heavy makeup or if i was feeling especially dirty
i thnk i put a little too much on my fafe the first time
as far as my skin.
it does not take much product per use
which to me feels much more exfoliating than this
i twist it up very slightly
this did a better job of clearing out my pores than any mask ever has
i loved this so much!!!
as usual, boscia products never let me down.
i also might be having it in my face for too long
if this is more convenient for you
even my family members have commented saying my skin seems more clear
it got better over time
a little goes a long way.
my skin looks even brighter now
a little goes a very long way
a little goes a long way
my skin is much brighter-- not to mention how soft my skin is
i found it's easier to maintain if i twist it up a little
it's not as tidy a travel companion as i imagined it would be
massage it a little more
i don't wind it up much at all.
one time a day is more than enough
remember a little goes a long way, so worth it.
a little goes a long way!
leave me greasier than before
i think that it helps my other products work better
i could see the difference too.
my makeup goes on better
comes out like a watery gel consistency which is slightly off-putting initially
so far this past winter i have needed to use this with a creme as well because it wasn't quite moisturizing enough
realized it is to be used more like an essence
the price might throw some off a little
a few drops are more enough for your face
also a little goes a long way.
felt much smoother after application
it does not linger very long
so i felt using my hands were better.
i also found the benefits to be quite long lasting
a little goes a long way.
a little goes a long way!
especially given it doesn't last long
i wear a more sheer makeup now
my skin has never felt better
the consistency is much more like a silky liquid on not so much like an oil
maybe the negative reviews are using way too much product?
i am now going without foundation more than than ever
your skin just changes as you get older
give it a little patience
the longer you use this
now it's better than ever
now its even better
my face is so much more glowy than it was before!
a little really goes a long way with this one too
btw i keep it on longer than the recommended time
it works better that way
this is by far the best brightening mask out there making my skin finally one toned
i do get quite a few uses from it
it does make the color more even
i only gave 4 stars though because it is pricey.
makes it a lot brighter.
love it but a little too expensive
my skin is certainly smoother
for the price, i feel like it could do more.
my skin felt so much smoother
how it's a gentle exfoliation rather than a more tougher
it tingles a little bit at first
decided to try a little experiment
do not be alarmed as you will see your pores get bigger
both products are a little pricey
they do more for your skin
a little bit goes a long way!
i loved after even the first use my skin started looking a little bit even
my skin has gotten so much brighter over time
i could never justify paying this much on something so small
rather more of a treatment that will take a little while longer to see excellent results
might have helped a little evening out the tone
noticed a better result than anything else
so far so good.
after one use my face looked a little brighter
and the best part is a little goes a long way.
even acne itself is better
maybe enough for a dozen masks?
this one works better than the algenist
is a lot quicker than the 3-step ole henriksen brightening mask system
my only downside to this is that it doesn't go nearly as far as some of my other masks
i cannot take a little bit
that may be a better choice since you will get probably 3 times as many uses out of a full size
they are just healing little pimples now
made his skin look so much healthier
this is my favourite one by far
this mask i tend to leave on for longer than it says to
love this mask for any skin type who needs a little brightening
my skin looked a little cleaner after
my skin tone is more even
spent only god knows how much
a little goes a long way with this product
my skin has never looked better.
i probably have two more applications
it may sting your skin slightly if you rub it aggressively
the backs of her arms to help with those little bumps some tend to get
i cut them into quarters because i feel like they are bigger then i need
so much that my husb
brighter than it's been in a long time
i just wish it wasn't so expensive as far as wipes go
there are times when i'm too lazy to do so
use them pretty much nightly.
this is working better on so many issues
looks healthier after i use them
they are a bit pricy
it helps me from breaking out as much
my skin is sooo much smoother after just one use!
its not too harsh
they work so well!
it makes so much sense
so far i like it
"well it looks clearer
i just wished it lasted longer
my skin looks better
making the splurge seem a little more reasonable
this one does - and more.
if it wasn't so expensive
this mask does wonders too bad it only lasts for about 24 hours ☹
only giving 4 stars because it is pretty pricey.
i've tried a lot of masks hoping for this kind of result though
i've spent so much money on primers
once i've used one of these masks my face is so so much smoother
under eyes are much smoother
the best part is you don't need a lot of product for a use so a little goes a long way
a little also goes a long way.
it softens and does so much more.
it still makes my skin look smoother than before
have little bumps under your skin that seems to never go away no matter what you use?
a little goes a long way!
make it look healthier
most importantly get rid of the bumps on my face so my makeup would go on smoother
this mask made my skin so much smoother after only one use
will continue to buy it it has saved my skin i couldn't say better things about it
my skin has never looked more clear
my skin is much softer
more even after using this mask
it's much more affordable than a lot of other masks
a little goes a long way so the full size bottle will probably last a long time
this one is better
i wouldn't use it more than once a week
because it would be too harsh on the skin
i can say since i incorporated the two origins mask to my beauty routine my skin has changed so much for the better
sometimes more depending on what i did that week
ex: if i have been going to the gym an sweating a lot i use it more often
also a little bit goes a long way.
a lot better than more pricey masks.
you don't have to use too much
made my skin tone more even
was a little worried this mask would be too harsh for me
my overall skin tone just much better
get a little bit painful
you get so much for your money!
would have given a 5star if it did clean pores a little bit more
which are clearly too very different things
it did it better than masks i've tried that do claim to help with pores
then when the exfoliation get to be too much
i'd rather leave it for 5
it's waaaaay easier to take off
not too much for my skin that gets sensitive in the winter
def better than the origins charcol one.
this mask is nicer than your average clay mask-it just feels gentler on your skin
a little goes a long way
every time i'm feeling particularly blah with a ton of little bumps
it helped the little breakout i had that was just impossible to get rid of
i love it so much!!!
i hope it will keep getting better
this product was so much better than i had anticipated
which is more expensive than this one
now, they are so much smoother!!!
i ended up loving this one even more.
plus it's way cheaper than a lot of other masks that do the same thing
my pores went sooo much smaller after one use
many more amazing effects
this mask is so much gentler than the other clay mask sold for acne prone skin
helps it look more even
t did leave my skin feeling a little bit tight
as all of the little bumps
i get so many compliments on how smooth
sadly that didn't last more than a day :
after about 3 uses my skin is so much better.
my skintone is more even
they are too strong for me
my skin was much softer
could get more than one use out of it
is so much lighter
squeeeezed every drop i could out of the little package
a little goes a long way
does everything it says and more!
it not too heavy
i put a bit too much
goes on so smooth
this one seems perfect thus far for my combination skin
this works so well!
did nothing for me even with generous application
they've all pretty much owned up to their claims
just wish it was easier to close
a little goes a long way
i just wish it came in better packaging
this is one of the better masks i've done.
so far i've tried the green tea
still have enough for 1-2 more
rather under my makeup
way more than one time use
it also lasts for quite a while:
the rest of my face is pretty normal
i can get quite a few more out of it
i've only tried the rose so far
she loves it so much.
over the past year my skin started to get lots of little bumps under the skin
it dried down way more than i thought
rather than one that feels a little tacky
you can easily get more than one use out of each pod
the sephora ones are as good as or better than their competition
i will definitely buy more of these!
i can get more than one use out of it
so far i have tried two of these
i picked these up the other day just because my skin needed a little bit of nourishment
i would have to use this plenty more times to notice a true skin difference
will definitely have to pick up more
a little goes a long way
my skin looks so much smoother
no matter how much sleep i get
my face was much cleaner
the entire week after it was much calmer
i can get way more for the same as this product
i've never found a sleeping mask that i love more than this one
still giving it 5 stars because of the results.
the little packets are too fiddly for long term use for me
even fit in the little box it comes with
they definitely made my skin much brighter after one use
one little pod lasts you 4-5
maybe even 6 uses depending on how much you use
this one seemed better for my skin so for 4$ i thought why not?
which means that i can still feel it a little bit when i wake up
i enjoyed these so much.
you can get quite a few uses out of them if you are reasonable with how much you use
my acne was a lot better
i love how much product is in it
a little bit of it goes a long way
it was the only change to my usual routine
look noticeably better than usual
other than the fact that i wish they made a bigger bottle of this because it's so amazing
i couldn't be happier with the results.
a little product truly goes a long way
you get a lot of product in the little package
it costs $16 more than shiseido's version.
i feel it works better than shiseido's.
a little goes a long way
skin just looks better all day.
it is a little expensive
this one is better
why so much money
had given up on finding a product that wouldn't make it worse
gets every little bit of eye makeup off
the other thing i've noticed with this is that is made me break out a little if this was the only cleanser i used
there seems to be a little bit of oil residue when you have wash it off which is probably great for drier skin
i also wish the bottle was bigger.
i would highly recommend this product it's cheaper than the other stuff
i like it better than the estee edit one
cost way more than $15
i couldn't be happier!
i love this so much i had to
a little really goes a long way
one pump is more than enough
everytime so much more makeup comes off
i've seen an amazing result in my skin looking so much cleaner
just wish it could be a tad cheaper though ;)
have been happy thus far
at a much lower price point
my skin has never been better!
my skin has improved so much
my skins feels so much better
the sephora oil is just as good if not better in my opinion
so you are getting the same quality cleanser for way cheaper
takes just a little longer
my clarisonic to get my face even cleaner
generally do 1-3 depending on how much makeup i'm wearing that day
a little just melts everything with no effort .
the bottle is a pretty decent size that will last about 6-8months with twice a day use because one good pump covers my whole face well
it still spreads well
pretty normal on the rest of my face
it has changed my routine for the better!
i hate buying cleansing oil that costs more than $30 because it finishes very quickly
it looks like i have to buy oils that are much more expensive than this because they do so much better job than this one
it is the reason why i'm giving this oil 4 stars rather than 5
the harder it is to get off my skin
it is also a lot easier to remove your make up with this
cleans the makeup off my face better than any product i've used
other than that i love it
no longer feeling like an older woman at 31:
a little goes a long way.
i love this eye concentrate so much!!!
so far my under eyes seem smoother
my concealer looks much better when i use this first
i would definitely buy more
my skin looks more even toned
my scars look lighter as well
my right cheek is a lot worse
much love for it!
i am pruchasing it to prove it on a longer term
believe there its more to see
don't need much in the lifting department
started receiving so many complements on how much i was glowing
have therefore been around long enough to try lots of different products
it actually does help make my face appear more toned
would like to stay away from those until i get a littler older
this actually made my "elevens"
little bit of a process learning the best application for this
other than this it's a great product to help slow the aging process
a little goes a long way
it made my skin look a lot healthier
this goes on so light
a little bit of the all about eyes rich cream
makes it last longer
i add a little ddml cream only at night.
after the second night they feel so much more plump
loved it so much i went
i like it better than aae
because a little goes a long way
after about a month i feel like i've hardly made a dent in the little tub
i little goes a long way so the product itself last you a long time
it does get a bit oily if you use too much
a little goes a long way
it helped her face so much.
a little goes a long way
a little goes a very long way
like i said a little goes a long way
though i probably wouldn't use this if i were more prone to breakouts
am considerably more dry now than ever before
this is much much lighter
the smaller size lasted me 3-4 months as a little goes a long way
their products get better
it an get a little greasy if you put on too much.
i like that it's in a jar rather than a pump because you can control how much you use
and a little does go a long way.
i can already tell my lines are getting more faint as i continue
to be honest its helping with those too
this worked so much better than the 1k i dropped on that minimal improvement
it is a little painful
that is a big help too
it glides much better
i couldn't be happier
the full minute on each side is just too much
my skin recovered much more quickly
feels healthier than it has since i turned 40
like many others it seems
love it so much i just bought the full face one.
my eyes already look better
i'd say i'm already having good results
by the next morning i don't feel anything except a little tight
they're getting worse as i age
the dark circles look are looking soooo much better
this is much less costly
it hasn't been very long
perhaps get something a little more balm like
i still look like me, but healthier.
it's better than the fine lines i have
as far as the pain goes...it is really nothing.
a little goes a long way.
it became much easier
it is a little hard to get used to the sensation
helps your foundation go on so much better
the tiny bottle lasted so long that can't even imagine how long it'd take me to get through a whole bottle
i ended up wearing very minimal/no makeup for a good month or two when it got especially bad
makes blending my foundation so much of an easier task
the only thing is that it is a little too expensive
don't add too much as it
a little bit goes a long way
it just makes my skin feel even more fresh!
one drop goes a long way with this product so you deft get your money's worth
it also made my foundation look more flawless
probably too little to notice a difference since i was kinda iffy about putting oil on my face
a little goes a long way!
the bottle may seem too small
i hope you have better luck
a little goes a long way.
get a more accurate idea of how much foundation i need
if could give it more than a 5 start i would
now i want to try the other ones since i love this one so much
am no longer flaky
my face looks more smooth
any more than the effects the coverage
if you want an overall more glowy
my foundation has never looked better
so far both the radiance
i dont put more than 6 drops
have tried just about everything out that would help treat red/uneven skin tone
so far so good
if the base were heavier they'd be perfect.
a little goes a long way i only add 1 drop per pump
my skin has never looked better
i like it so far
a little goes a long way too :)
i couldn't be happier with this purchase!
my skin is so much softer, smoother, and clearer.
gives enough hydration even though i wish it had just a tad bit more
other then that my skin looks so much more healthier
other than that i have noticed my skin feeling more "bouncy"
so far i love it for my dryness.
only negative- if you use too much it can feel a little sticky for a while
- too much may take longer to absorb
obviously that only makes matters worse
a little bit goes a long way so the value is good
pretty much everything was still to heavy for my face
i will be using a lot more of this product years to come
my skin texture has improved so much, i love it.
it's been so much better ever since i started using this
it's definitely improved my texture so much
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way
my skin feels noticeably better without ever feeling greasy
love the texture and a little goes a long way.
would still work well
my skin has never looked better
so a little goes a long way.
a little goes a long way
just take a little of this
which goes a long way
clear face a lot faster now.
works way better than any face lotion.
i loved it so much
i feel the new gel more to preserve moisture better than before
love it so far
have given up on them because i just stick to serums which work well enough
for the winter i want something more
they always seem too heavy
sometimes with an oil under it if i need more moisture
the price is just too high for me
a little goes a long way
it is thicker than i expect
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way
i've spent a lot of time trying different products to find one that works well under my makeup
i do feel like i should have bought the smaller jar because a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way with this one.
it's expensive, but a little goes a long way.
a little bit goes a long way
a little goes a long way
i love this one even more
is better than ever
a little bit goes a long way
plus i can see my skin looks smoother
a little goes a long way.
who could ask for more?
it's so good that i even bought some more from this line
well this one does!
the spf protection is better than anything else i've tried
if i would of used it a little more wisely i probably could of made it to 7 full months with this product :d
a little goes a long way
people think he is older than me because of all his wrinkles
i said to him that his wrinkles got smaller
as far as my eyes
i even feel like it did a way better job than my ptr in wrinkle night cream
i tend to need something heavier than this in the winter
a little goes a long way with this product.
you're using way too much
it would be too much combined
it stung a little bit at first
i think my skin looks brighter after using this for about a month
sake balm works well for me so far
a little goes a long way
i find it too much to use in the am under makeup
my face is pretty much pore less!!
a little bit goes along way
my skin feels better than before
my make up is going on so much smoother
a little goes a long way too which is so great.
have had more comments on how good my skin looks since i started using this
she just looks younger.
just a little bit is needed morning
my skin is much more smooth
also, a little goes a long way!
just now ran out so a little goes a long way
heard this was better plus with the extra benefits
do not put too much product on
i usually use only a little dab or so for my whole face
has made my skin look better
has helped y complexion so much
this is more of a night time thing for me
a little goes a long way
it has never looked healthier
4 stars because it's more of a night time moisturizer as it makes putting on make up a bit trickier
no more than a very bit is needed
a little goes a long way.
my skin is much brighter
a little bit goes a long way .
a little goes a long way
a little bit of it goes a long way.
from what i've used so far
(little goes a very long way)
since most seem to break me out
so much more hydrated than when i used my normal moisturizer
this wears so well.
making my makeup go on easier
a little bit goes a long way4.
is a lot more healthier looking
you have to pay a bit more for the good stuff
this made it really less oily than before
and a little of it goes a long long way.
it still has quite a bit in it
my skin is somewhat back to normal
it's still quite expensive for the amount of product you're receiving
it seems to help my makeup go on smoother
so far i'm really liking it
little bit goes a long way!
yes a little goes a long way so err on the side of using less
a little product goes a long way with this
a little bit around the nose
as i said a little goes a long way
see how i feel better switching
even better in the morning
no more acne either!
it's better than many other eye moisturizers i've tried
have tried countless products without much to show for it
a little goes a long way
may layer something a bit richer over it during these superdry months
i will definitely be buying more!
my eyes have never looked better.
better than many super expensive high-end products i've tried
far more $ than this
it must because my eyes look much better after using this product
i actually felt mine looked better.
this one is wayyyyy better
my wrinkles are getting better at disappearing
a tad on the pricey side
bags as well as it has for me
this one by far has made a big difference i use it in the morning
seems like they've reduced the wrinkles too
how can they charge so much?!
perhaps it is just my skin
on others it seems to work very well with no issues
that my eyes are closer to even
it works better on dark circles
puffiness than any other product i've tried so far
a little goes a long way
so far it feels great
a little is all you need.
for now i think this works better
better than most on the market right now.
as i am 67 i would notice if they got worse
it makes you look less tired.
the eyes look better
i gave this 4 stars rather than 5 because it is not quite as rich as i would have liked
makes the skin around my eyes look better
a little goes a long way.
a little goes a long way.
cheaper than most eye creams
you only need very little so the jar last forever
i don't think it actually help with the dark circles much
my circles are getting a little lighter
i think it is helping with the circles too
now use it in the daytime too because my eyes look noticeably younger
frankly i'd love it to have a bit more residue like a heavier eye cream
it isn't so much a balm
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way
the most important thing is it can make your longer
not sure how much it helps for dark circles
a little goes a long way
looked a lot better when using this eye balm
dark circle a little bit
i just take a little dab, and it goes a long way.
my lines seem softer
not so much in the corners
but overall great so far.
the skin around my eyes feels so much better
it does seem to help on those mornings i look more tired
it looks like the lines around my eyes are less define now
it did make the skin around my eyes seem more vibrant
you only need a little bit
other than that it is pretty decent
it works well as a day cream in the winter too
i don't break out as much
it's almost insane how much better my skin looks
get get the larger size because it's very moisturizing for my combination skin with out over doing it i also notice notice my skin is much softer
thought it might be too heavy at first
said it made my skin look tighter
without using much product
a little goes a long way
this is a much better value
a little goes a long way.
less is more of this amazing stuff.
can use very little of it
a little goes a long way
this time it feel looser
warning- a little goes a long way!!
that were more expensive
its also alot more effective
oh, and a little goes a long way!
one tip - don't put too much on at once.
the best part is that a little goes a long way!
i only use at night as it is a little rich for under makeup
the jars last a long time because you only need a little bit
a little really goes a long way
it's great so far
may be too heavy for the summer months
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way.
my skin loves it even more
the tester must have been old or maybe exposed to too many different h
i like it very much
much better than i expected!
feels so much healthier
this is much much better
this one is so light
a little goes a very long way with this rich cream
i found it great for younger aging skin as well
a little goes a long way
just seemed less irritated
much more efficient than even la prairie's ridiculously expensive
it even keeps it clear
even better than the "pricy" creams
so far so good
i just love this product as well as other two.
so far i'm in love
quicker than a regular mask of course
to be straightforward : it makes me feel cleaner than most other products like this i've used
a little goes a long way with this mask
so that's even better
i feel like it gets my skin cleaner than a lot of the other cleansers i was using
i think this is a great skin care addition to have during the warmer months
i honestly like these better than the sheet masks
this mask was by far the better of the two products
the tube was bigger than expected since this is
i find it more difficult to manage over the sink.
with this pregnancy i have broken out so much
alittle does go a long way
its had helped a whole lot
they spread out really well so you don't need to use much
i need to try it few more times to see if it actually does
which helps calm my skin when it feels more irritated than usual
i got so much more than that
a little goes a long way.
a little goes a long way.
a little goes a long way with the foaming action
i probably use less than what is recommended
this seems to be different though
i couldn't be happier
my skin is more even
they're more mild than i expected
so far i love their products.
wanted something i could use longer
my skin felt much softer
i really like these more as treatments rather than daily cleansers
it has helped a little
you only need a little to cover a big area so 1
for how much you get
my face does look slightly refreshed no matter what mask i use
overall just more balanced
a little goes a long way
i usually leave it on longer than the recomended 3 minutes just to give it a bit more time to work
there isnt much of a difference between the 3
a little goes a long way!
this product will go a very long way
a little goes a long way with these products
a little of this goes a long way.
also a little bit of product goes a long way.
becoming too lax on my beauty routine lately
i generally leave on about 10 minutes any longer
thats almost too much
it goes such a long way.
not needing a lot product says a lot
a little goes a long way
i love this cleanser so much.
a little goes quite a way
i don't think i'll repurchase it once my current one is used as i tend to stick with slightly heavier serums
which probably won't be for a while because a little goes such a long way with this product
nothing has changed my skin more than tatcha.
fine lines better than anything else i've tried without causing break outs
hadn't tried any because they are so expensive
that could be because i tend to use too many products
it helps my makeup stay longer
now my makeup goes on very smoothly
very little goes a long way.
the formula is quite a bit thicker than other serums i've tried
a little goes a long way
this one worked far better on the wrinkles on my forehead than any other
getting product out that way
as much as i love this product
a little goes a long way
unfortunately i am using more than required.
wuth a better pump it would be a 5!
they take a longer time
i tend to use more
that gets me better results
as a result it gets expensive because i run out faster
even better than what i was using before.
i couldn't be happier.
nothing has ever given me results like this product has
my skin has never looked better
worse both looked flatter
so far nothing from algenist has caused me to breakout
i've only been using a little less than a week
i know these seem a little pricey
'm sure after a longer time i will see even better results
i guess it just took a little longer for me
no more crape skin for me.
it's been a little over a week
going today to buy more!
i can already tell that my makeup sits wayyyy better in those areas
a little goes a long way.
although it does fade a little
it works much better than the thicker
not too over powering
day 1: so far so good!
also, a little bit of product goes a long way.
i keep waiting to see more reviews before i buy since it's so expensive
the product itself lasted a very long time since just a bit goes long way
a little goes a long way
my face seriously a lot better
i've always struggled with my face being more red than the rest of my body
i asked my mom if she thought my skin had looked considerably less red lately after a month of this
i feel so much more comfortable waking up
i looked significantly better to the point when my husb
no more bumps either
my skin is less ''reactive''
gets worse with coffee or alcohol
just wish it came in a little bigger size.
i notice my makeup goes on way smoother when i use this beforeh
had very little hopes for this.
goes well with my clarisonic
probably due more to work stress than wedding stress
my skin was remarkably better in the morning
my skin is actually calmer than its ever been
easier to cover with foundation or i'm even super okay now with going out in a bare face or using lighter coverage foundation again
that's better than looking like a cherry
other people have noticed it as well
this is the only product that made it better
it did a surprisingly good job toning it down
so far so good
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way.
but more importantly i love the product!
a little goes a long way
if it was a bit less expensive 5 stars all the way
i am usually hesitant to try new products because more often than not they break me out
this is a little too harsh for my skin.
this dries out my skin a little too much
i rarely have spots now
a pump would work better for this.
it has helped a lot with my acne as well.
a little goes a long way
it's definitely long lasting
it would work better
had to use more than what should've been necessary due to the first 2 steps drying my skin out so badly
couldn't justify the $125 price tag for as much as i had to use to compensate how dry my skin got from the first 2 steps
the price tag is a little out of my reach
so a little goes a long way
as much as i love this cream
a little goes a long way.
works well under make up too.
i like this much better.
i wear less makeup now
i wear less makeup now
smoother skin after just one use
not much has worked for me
a little goes such a long way
the price point is a little scary
my skin has never looked better.
the best of all is that after few uses i notice that my skin looks healthier
looks a lot more balanced
however there are other aha products which will also get the job done for much less
my skin has never looked better
a little goes a long way
i can see more clarity in my skin
half pump is more than enough for both eyes
a little bit goesa very very long way
looks healthier than ever
it is definitely effective in keeping my eye area looking younger than my age
it just keeps getting better
or when i need a little lift during the day
the amazing scent more than made up for this
a bottle lasts quite a long time
more importantly it keeps my skin young looking
my skin has been much better since
i've even been using a little on my hands.
even better if i've put on a little bit of argan or marula oil earlier in the evening
it absorbs well too
i don't like to spend more than $30 on products
i love this so much!!
not too light not too heavy.
my skin was better
as i got older it kept getting worse
a little amount goes a long way!
to make matters worse i have combination skin
a little does truly go a long way
it would provide a smidge more hydration
none of them have ever done what this gel cream has done
so far i'm liking this moisturizer
a little goes a long way
could get a better idea of how well it works
it takes off makeup only a little better than the average make up wipe
i find a little goes a long way.
so after a lot of trial
my skin has never looked better!!
love this product so much.
so for that the price point is a little eh
works so so well with my foreo.
it gives a little bit of a foaming effect that i enjoyed
my skin became more softer
not even a little red
cool on my skin i left on a little longer than 10 minutes because i was loving the effects
just so powerful that my skin needed help
it did sting my sensitive spot a little bit when i first applied it
pretty normal with no break outs
though it still has a pleasant
this mask retextures so much
you can put it on really thin so you get more out of the bottle than other br
and this is a lot cheaper!
feels so much better since using this
use this way more
which is not usual for me
i get more of others that aren't quite as effective
it actual makes my face feel less oily throughout the day than if i went without it
a little goes a long way
makes my makeup look better for some reason
no grey little thingy's all over my face like some claim
have normal skin too
i don't even use a foundation primer any more.
you also need very little
you don't need to use very much at a time.
this product was just too heavy for my liking
a lot of moisturizers make it worse especially under makeup
nor does it feel too heavy.
there are no more flakes
my skin looks more even
lips has changed 100% 1- pores my biggest concern seems to be wayyy more smaller 2- my skin complection has gotten super plump
i wouldn't use it as a day cream though as it is thicker than your usual day cream
a little goes a long way.
i don't use nearly as much of it as i have other lotions
none have suited my skin like this one
my hope in a jar is no longer any help!
it has changed my face for the better.
dark spots for a more even complexion
this does a pretty good job of getting moisture into my skin rather quickly
my skin looks even better than i expected with this product
it does not make me break out i have actually noticed that my face is slightly clearer with this
it is a little pricey, but it is amazing.
with only a little of product
at least what i've tried so far
a little bit goes a long
as i have gotten older i have moved toward more natural
can't wait to see how much better my skin looks after a month
if things turn out badly
my skin tone is definitely more even
makes my skin look so much brighter
i think the clarins one is working better
my skin has never looked better
a little goes a long way
i'll need to use it longer to see how much it does for my areas of concern- even skin tones
i've never had a product works so well
i found it works better as a primer
made it look healthier
i needed something with a bit more moisture than my juno oil was giving me
last longer than typical face washes
loving it so far
a little goes a long way
it definitely cleaned my skin to another level--more than any drugstore cleanser i've ever used
it doesn't make it worse though which is good!
i'd recommend this one so far
i still have more than half of the bar left
lasts a very long time
i love it so much
my skin has never looked better
really only use it a little in the shower if i'm in a hurry
this bar is so much better
it's a hint of rose, nothing too strong.
i wish it was a tad bigger!
as far as smell goes
it has made my skin look better without foundation
it doesn't wear quite as well with heavy foundation
i still have more than half left
i just dab a little extra on it
a little goes a long way
i find that less is always more
you need to press this in rather than rub
lately i've been relying on them more
i would not doubt the power in this little bottle
this oil has changed my face for the better
the consistency of this oil is not too heavy
my skin has still never looked better
a little goes a long way!
my skin is overall better than when i was using another face oil
my skin needed more than my usual moisturizer
i agree that the scent is a little strong
my skin has never looked better
all have not given me much in the way of results.
this is more than i have ever wanted to spend on skin care
more often than not i settle for latter
although this oil is a bit too much on the pricey side for me i am very wowed by its use
more than it usually looks.
honestly this oil exceeded my expectations so much
the easier the better
my skin has never looked better
5-6 drops is enough for the whole face
a little goes a long way
it's smell is much less intense
it's much lighter than any of sr's as well
when i tried this one i realized how much easier it was to massage into my skin
each day it gets even more flawless.
money well spent with satisfying result :)
this oil has changed my skin for the better.
a little goes a long way
is slightly less expensive -- although still pricey
don't use too much
a little goes a long way
found my face beginning to feel just a tiny bit too greasy
a little goes a long way so it will last forever.
a little goes a long way.
i couldn't be happier
feels better than i ever remember
based on how much is left
they tend to go away pretty quickly
this oil really makes it behave itself :d it's much more calm than it used to be
penetrates the skin much better than any moisturizer ever could
a little goes a long way with this oil
a little really goes a long way.
looks so much more even
even my foundation applies a lot smoother
a little goes a long way
herbivore maybe a better choice.
have always struggled to find a balance between moisturizing too much or too little
the quality of my skin has never been better- it's balanced
this oil feels slightly heavier
it actually balanced out my skin
all were just too heavy for day.
this seriously has helped fade my spots so much
it might be daunting to use more oil on your face
if you don't use too much
you can always add a few more drops for a more dewy finish
it makes your moisturizer last longer too when you mix the two together
i tried the herbivore as the tsubaki is little light
my skin looks more even
i actually do think my skin feels a little stronger
i also struggle with texture and this helps too.
leaves a little for my h
more even in tone
i've never used a better oil that has helped my skin in less than a week
did a little research on the ingredients
i stumbled upon this while looking at other much more expensive oils
i dont see any difference as far as acne scars go
i feel i wont buy this one again though because its very expensive ill get the cheaper one in the future
as far as effectiveness goes
i guess i'll see with more use
when this bottle is done i might keep searching for something a bit cheaper
don't care for the smell too much
while that one is only good for night use because it is heavy
as much or as little as you want
look forward to trying more from herbivore
skin is way smoother and no breakouts so far.
a little bit goes a long way
a little goes a long way
my make up application is looking better
my skin looks better than it has in a long time!
a little oil goes a long way
by far much better product than the store brought items on the shelves of the big stores
this one is better
definitely worth the money especially since a little goes a long way
it does last for a little while
works way better than i was expecting
my makeup even looks better
my skin tone much more even
i do wish the smell was stronger
feel far more smoothness on my face
it really did help my skin become brighter
i love this mask so much!!
i like this better than any of my glamgldw masks
this is so much better
a little goes a long way
am glad there was more to the product than just a pretty package
i usually use this product for eventful nights or days when i just want to have especially glowy skin
which i found gave my skin even better results
my acne was gone or smaller than it was
it also made it smoother than before
the congestion i've always had is mostly gone
much less textured than it was before
a little goes a loooong way
it just got better
i see better results from this product then the glamglow too which is great
it help lighten old scars quite a bit
my acne scars are starting to look a little better
it is so much more easier to remove them after using this
try not to put my skin through too much
my skin looked million times better
did feel so much better after first use
a little goes a long way
i honestlyi cannot stress how much of a difference this has made to my skin
a little bit of product goes a long way making it very affordable
my skin is much more firmer
i've gotten to the point that i use this every day as my skin is resilient
a little goes a long way
i also find that it is not harsh on the skin even if you leave it on for a few minutes longer
a little goes a long way
my acne has calmed down so much
at first i was skeptical about spending so much money on a face mask
my skin looked so much healthier
it only takes a little bit of product
skin tone is more even
a little goes a long way
i definitely notice a more even complexion when using this product
like everyone has said a little goes a long way.
i don't get it as much as i used to
it is a gel like texture so a little goes a long way
my skin has never looked more smooth!
a little really does go a long way- just be careful opening the jar
a little goes a long way
which i personally find way more convenient
so a little goes a long way
i wish it were a little bit more intense
it gets rough sometimes
so far i'm on my 4th day.
this works better than any other mask i've ever used
good as a mask, better as a spot treatment.
or have only helped for a little while.
a very little does a long way
little bit difficult to rinse off though.
it continues to look better with each use
also, a little of the gel goes a long way!
i couldn't be happier with the result
anything more than cleansing
it continued to get better every time i used it.
though it takes a little getting used to
a little goes a long way.
even if i wear it a little longer than recommended
i look forward to seeing how much better my skin gets after continued use
it is a little difficult to wash off
using this mask for the past week hasn't done much for my skin
my skin has become so much smoother
always goes on more smoothly after having used this
it still works just as well
the smell is a little off, but it works!
it works so well i can get past it
i also tried some more.
even on older skin
my skin has never felt better or less oily!
smoother than it's ever been
a little goes a long way too.
more healthy after using this stuff
cheaper than other masks that don't work as well.
my skin is so much smoother
i hardly have any bumps on my skin now
my skin feels much softer
makeup glides on better too.
have gone through many different approaches to my skin to try
everything made my skin worse
my acne is waaay better than it was.
i didn't notice too much of difference because it's such a slow
plus it's not even as expensive as glamglow.
the size is good for the price i was expecting a little more
i still have more then half the jar
overall more even texture
my skin tone already looks more even
the stuff lasts quite a long time
my skin tone looks more even
spent a lot of money trying to find this
and even better a little goes a long way.
a little goes a long way.
my skin has never felt smoother!
i think my dark spots may be getting lighter too
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way.
in my opinion this mask is better than that!
another plus is a little bit goes a long way
actually absorbs pretty quickly
it might be tough
over all my dark circles have never looked better
i wanted even better results
this is very light and a little goes a long way!
my dark circles have lightened so much
my entire under eye looks a lot brighter
so far it's great
i am liking so far the results
a little definitely goes a long way.
if you use too much i've noticed that it kind of sits on top of your skin
very lightweight and a little goes a long way.
$40 for an eye cream is a little much
there's so much product left
the lines seem smoother
the consistency is a bit thinner than my usual eye cream choice
my one con would be that even with the medium price point you aren't getting that much product
probably fine for everyday
my under eye feels more tight
a little goes a long way too.
a little goes a long way too!
a little goes a long way.
most of them do nothing for my dark circles
my lines get smoother
it's so thick, a little goes a long way.
a little went a long way
since i am approaching my mid twenties i wanted to take the "eye cream" thing a little more seriously
it sits fine under makeup as far as i can tell
a little goes a long way
well this is so light
which gets worse in the winters
this is just as good if not a bit better
you get more bang for your buck
a little goes a long way
i like it very much
they did very little
my dark circles got even worse
it did that and more!
it may be a little much for the upcoming summer season
this has helped my dehydrated under eyes so much
you only need to use a little bit at a time
pretty much nearly gone!
a little bit goes a very long way so you use a lot less product
it goes on so smooth
i don't find it helps to reduce dark circles much
i think i would prefer this one more than the kiehl's one
i went through so many different ones
a little goes a long way
i still have a bit of dark colouring
so far i love it
a little goes a long way
a little goes a looooong way
good price too compared to the rest of eye creams
only a little bit is needed to go a long way with this product
healthier when i use this one compared to my other usual eye cream
this has been perfect so far- i have been using it day
a little goes a long way!
the fine lines look better
i found this little gem
a little goes a long way.
a little goes a long ways
it was more than enough
my under eye area have never looked better
the price is on point too!
a little goes a long way
it spreads way more than anticipated
my dark circles are much lighter
a little goes a long way
it goes on so well
a little goes a long way and the smell is light.
my skin really started looking more even
here's hoping for more of the same...
this is just one more product that will help me do that
my skin is much more less oily
give it little bit of time
a little bit goes a long way
then i apply it much lighter in the mornings
a little goes a long way
not much better than some cheaper serums i've used
my complexion is better
or worse--my face
a little goes a long way
this product has changed my skin, for the better!
have realized my face does seem brighter
although the first few times you can feel a bit of firming
saying that my skin is brighter
i love that it makes spf more potent
a little goes a long way.
this product is just amazing so far
see if it was more than just a cute
goes on so easily
more importantly i love the product itself
get an idea of how much this works for you before investing in the big one
this product is a little goes a long way.
of course everybody's skin reacts differently
this gives me a more even skin-tone
a little goes a long way
the others not so much
i like it so much
i am now on my second bottle of this serum- with much much brighter skin
i think it works better with tcl.
not so much in love with the price
my face actually felt more clean at the end of the day
i feel like i can find something just as good for cheaper
because this product layers much better with moisturizer
disliked the skin underneath even more
it has made driving more difficult
i've actually grown to like it.
i can definitely tell when i skip more than a few days
it feels the same though
i even noticed it last a little longer
what would you rather have
my skin has changed so much
or most importantly break me out
i would much rather have something effective
i love this product so much!
in fact, i love the whole de line so much!
everything i ever tried made my skin break out even worse
now i barely have to wear that any more
it was a solid option for a lot less money
my skin has never looked better
for a while there i was using too many skin care products
i even think it has the added benefit of making my skin look tanner
it does have a stronger scent than other de products
only if you use too much
lips keep it far from that
other than that though
i tend to have to use a little more of it than i would a thicker moisturizer
in my late 20's my skin has gotten a little less oily i still tend to find that a lot of creams
love it so much but so expensive.
as so many others have
ever since using this it is no longer flaky just a smooth surface
my boyfriend noticed that my face is glowing more than usual
because you only need a little
your money goes a long way
she tolled me she loved this gel very much
that its much better than the one which comes with the device
i like this product very much.
that got way too much sun over the years
a little goes a long way!
i love it so much i plan on trying other produces from this line
definitely use a little as it goes a long way.
a little goes a long way
this was a slightly iffy purchase but i love it!
a little goes a long way!
if anything my skin is looking better than ever!
she can use it too
since it's a foam a little bit goes a long way.
you get so much use out of one can
it still has a ton of product
for some it could be a little strong
a little difficult to rub around upon application
other than that it's a good product.
i like the feeling of using the two together much more
this would be better for me in the summer.
overall it does a good job it's just a little much for my skin right now
i pumped too much into my h
while it doesn't take off make up very well
so far i like it!
felt i had to use a little to much with my clarisonic
i usually use about the size of a cotton ball maybe a smidgen more
a little goes a long way.
it gets only four stars because the flagrance is a bit too heavy
skin was smoother, softer and pores not so big.
i usually leave it on a bit longer
my complexion is way better
think the packaging has changed from the dropper style since so hopefully it's better
i do think its a little pricey for the amount
i will probably stick to the algenist because it lasts longer
it is just all around better looking
shadows aren't there as much
night simply because it was expensive
my skin is smoother and more lifted.
my left eye is more hollow than my right
it is a little sticky so you don't have to use much of it
even just using a few drops when i stayed with her for a week i noticed my skin felt so much softer
my face seem to be plumper and softer.
a little bit goes a long way
my dark circles are much lighter
so looks like sephora will get more of my $$$
just wish it were a bit less pricey
i really didn't think i would find an eye cream that performed better than my current one
this was a very stressful week where i didn't get as much sleep
my under eye area is getting bags a little bit
even the expensive ones that aren't supposed to
a little goes a long way
a little goes a very long way
when i was getting compliments i started to look more closely in the mirror
my lines are getting smaller as the hours pass
it lasts forever for a deluxe sample i have quite a lot left
now i'm not working against a heavier droop on one side
crepiness just as well as algenist
i couldn't be happier with this product.
many much pricier than this
one tube lasted me much longer than i ever expected it too
my eye area is so much smoother
the skin tone is has become more even
i've tried many eye creams with little or no difference
lasting longer on my new plump
after 10 minutes my undereye area is much more firm
my skin is better than it's ever looked
made the discoloration so much better
some spots have even dimished
within a week your skin should look so much brighter
since i was little
this is so much better.
do the trick with better consistency
a tad over 1 week of use with this product
they are much lighter
the rest of my face is also looking fresher
nothing works as well as this.
much more even now
it hasn't ever looked so good before
it is more expensive than others
it goes a long way
this product definitely requires a bit of patience
my dark spot has improved so much!!!
my face is much clearer
my skin feels better since using it
have gotten a lot lighter
they are getting lighter
the best thing about this is not having to use so much foundation
my skin has never looked so even
my skin has never looked better.
i've never had a product work as well or as fast as this
so far i've definitely noticed a change in my skin
skin has never been clearer or more even toned
this works better than anything i've tried
one just needs patience
it can sting a little
there is nothing like this product to get my skin back to normal
but much lighter than with out using murad.
it's actually made me look so much more youthful
it is then lighter than my skin tone
with this product my skin in clearer than ever
then you have more breakouts
overall my skin just looks better
i looked better during one of the most stressful times of my life than i do at home
after using this i feel younger and brighter.
my makeup stays on so much better!
you only need a little.
has never looked better
additional bonus: a little bit goes a long way.
my skin feels so much smoother.
minus one star because it has made my skin a little more sun-sensitive
so now i have to be even more vigilant with sunscreen because i can get a little pinky with just a couple minutes of sun on short err
a little goes a long way
i can see easily how much i have left
i love it so far
i am happier with it than with any other exfoliator i have come across
a little goes a long way.
even skin tone just as it says!
my skin could not be better
so far so good
ahas can be a little harsh
i figured i'd better try it
it's even better than the md forte!
i at first thought this was a little too abrasive for my skin
t has more time to sink in to my skin
long term use has made my skin feel more plump
i think i might like it better than the pore reform polish
i get the sensation of it doing more than just sitting on the skin
you have to be a bit patient
it's way better than anything i used before
this helped so much!
proactiv was starting to be a bit much for my skin
it worked better than anything i've ever tried before
as i age it was drying my skin out far too much
i still struggle with it
it has done a far better job than the acne line
while it was adequate in doing so
so far this product is working well.
gotten rid of those for the most part
those are just too potent for every day use
stripped my skin of too much oil
a little goes a long way.
i would say my skin is much softer
looks much smother since i have been using this
looks so much better
my skin always feels so much smoother
nothing as bad as they were
this pretty much makes putting on makeup disastrous
it seems to work even better at smoothing my skin
a little grainy, but not too much.
ive been using it for a little less than a month now
my skin looks so much better since beginning to use this to cleanse my skin
skin simply looks more radiant which is not easy to accomplish at age 68
is a little less expensive
definitely makes a difference in taking more makeup off
there are a lot of things i tend to become lazy with
nothing works as well
its just so much softer on your eyes
only thing is it just slightly burns my eyes
will definitely try more in hopes of finding one that doesn't sting too much
it liquifies easier than other oils i have used.
i just hope it will be better coverage?
or when there is too much buildup
so this works well
it even has a pump
and i do go through it rather quickly.
so far this is my favourite
i like this more than bioderma
with this product my skin is clearer than it has ever been
leaves a bit more of a residue than i would like
i could not be happier
after a few days of using this my skin looks better than it ever has
my face look more young
i leave it on a little longer than the 30 seconds per the instructions
it works good so far
make my skin get better
i don't have as much blemishes as before.
s aren't putting too much oil on my skin
stick with it after 2 weeks for better results.
i could barely see the outcome.
not as much as in the past
my skin is looking better than it ever has
i couldn't be happier with it
pretty much exactly the same skin results so will either switch to another br
or just go back to the cheaper clinique
a little goes a long way.
no doubt keeps my skin clearer than using anything else
it's gone down so much
paired with my clarisonic my skin has never been better
it seems like it is getting more expensive
this is a much better cleanser.
my skin has never looked better
other treatments made them worse
some worked better than others
my skin seems to be reacting well still
my skin has smoothed out so much!
a little goes a long way
i no longer had dirt
like too much of anything
it's been helping my skin so much
its pretty much all clear!!
if you tend to have more dry skin i probably wouldn't try this because it is a little drying or maybe just use a couple times a week
is much too harsh to use for every wash
so far its great
so for anyone struggling with acne
this helps them go away a lot faster
a little goes a long way for this product.
it doesn't make my skin more red which is an issue for me as well
a little goes a long way
my makeup even looks better
i don't usually have much of an issue
it was a bit of a gamble because there are very few reviews out there
my face looked better in three days
i tend to get very fine lines in that area between lower eye
expect it may take more months of application to see better results
they already look less deep
it would cost me way too much to fix my crows feet
now i am using less makeup because the wrinkles are so much better
i apply only a little bit in both the morning
i notice that it dries more quickly that way
i don't tend to wear too much
a little goes a long way
especially when my skin is feeling a bit more on the dryer side
i couldn't recommend them more or this product more
a little bit on the pricier side but it's ok.
still in love with it
it does it well
i actually cursed because it was so expensive
it does it well
as far as this one goes
unfortunately until i get richer
i think they help to get the product deeper into the skin
since other options weren't much cheaper
i seem to have a more even skin tone
a little goes a long way
wasn't expecting too much
it fits so well
seems to work quite well
you only need a little bit of this product to go a long way
i love this so much!
i love this so much more than salt based-scrubs because it's much gentler
makes my daily routine so much easier.
my overall skin tone looks more even
'm not sure how well this would remove heavier eye makeup or full coverage foundations
i actually find it works better to use it with wet fingers
wake up in the morning with a much more even skin tone
it's pricey, but a little goes along way.
so far so good for me
i believe that the little three ounce tub is too expensive
a little goes a long way
my skin has never been better.
even breaks down my eye make up fairly well
whereas eve lom has more of a paste texture than this one
have had no issues with this so far
a little goes a long way.
although a little goes a long way
a little bit goes a long way as well.
really like it so far
i sometimes get a little red
l'occitane's immortelle oil "makeup remover" is much better
a little also goes a very long way.
far better outcome the second time around as my oily/combo/aging skin appreciated the ingredients
i needed something more travel friendly
or massage the product a little more before applying
blue moon is far better
my skin has never looked better
thought this did a better job
i really have nothing more to say other than this product is perfection
made me look less less tired
maybe i need to use it a bit longer
maybe slightly with them
it works better than the other products algenist carries
thus treatment really does what it says.
a little goes a long way
this is too expensive at full price for something that doesn’t have amazing effects
it seems to work better for me at night
it is rather expensive
so far hasn't broke my face out
a little bit of this product goes a long way
wanted to try something new as my skin has been changing lately
a little bit goes a long way.
i little goes a very long way
it was just too heavy for daily use
it might be a bit too much for anyone who is acne prone
rub for a bit longer to see if it works better next time
you use very little
it is rather pricey
the jar is a little on the thrifty side -- a glass jar would have been nicer --
using it at night also seems to leave me with a few little breakouts
this product is slightly different in formula
i don't care too much for the scent though.
it makes my hands look better!
a little goes a long way
this gets rid of every little bit
there is so much product in the jar
you need very little to use on the face
however i did notice that this tends to dry a lot faster
i also like to do a little extra on some areas
do not worry about thinning out the profuct too much
the gel is much easier to apply
i don’t have to apply too much of the gel
i save so much time with less makeup application
feel better with the face i present
it did burn a little in my eyes
you only need a little bit.
this cleanser is a lot easier to work with.
maybe even plumper skin
i used this mask 3 times so far
my makeup is going on more smoothly
i needed more softening and much more moisture.
finding a daily moisturizer that balances it out without adding too much oil has been a challenge
i might want even more in winter months
since i have been using this product i have gotten more compliments on my skin than ever before
