not greasy at all
my makeup doesn't flake off
it doesn't strip or make me face feel tight
you want to hate this because it's an expensive bar of soap
wasn't always a fan of using a bar of soap as my cleanser
my girlfriend brought to my attention that it has a time release anti-wrinkle ingredient that continues to work on your skin long after you've washed
this seems to remove my makeup
break outs while soothing unlike any other cream i have tried
don't think of it of a scrub
one dab of this is enough for all over.
if you don't touch your face
it's not greasy on me
i am justifying it as i'm not caking myself in color correctors anywhere near as much anymore
i didn't find it to be too greasy to wear under makeup
you'll fall in love with it also
i just can't help loving the purplely cream too
he usually uses a prescription cortisone cream when it's bad
doesn't feel super heavy or oily
it feels like it just magically smoothed everything
t won't be too heavy for nighttime
it doesn't sit on top of your skin
it doesn't all disappear into the skin
as a result my lips chapped terribly all the way around
the hollows of my under eye sockets look like they need a filler or something bc i get these bags that always make me look tired
many creams make me itch, puff up or break out.
it's not noticeable once you work this product into your skin
no greasy feeling at all.
the tackiness goes away if you give it time
maybe that's why i haven't found it to be sticky or blue ?
it's like a cream rather than lotion
it's too spendy for me
didn't make me oily at all
there are very few lotions that don't irritate it
i love the texture, even if it is thick.
googled it to make sure i didn't need to wash it off because it was so sticky
it's really expensive for small jar.
so i use it as a night cream.
something i would usually never pick out for myself since i have oily skin
doesn't feel or leave a greasy resididue
everything irritates my eyes
it's the only rich
heavy moisturizer that doesn't make me wake up with greasy nasty skin
i know it's pricey
it melts right into your skin
if you use too much it will leave your skin feeling oily
if he doesn't wash
it's easy to keep with me at all times if i'm doing something where i need some instant hydration
unlike a lot of oils i've tried it absorbs right into the skin without leaving a greasy look
it's nice that you can apply this product to your face
it's not like other oils that feels gross or heavy
it soaks right in and does not leave it greasy.
this stuff is pricey
have always broken me out in either little white bumps or pimples
it does not feel oily or heavy on the skin
it smells so good i use it on my body -- there are flakes of gold in it
the best part is that it doesn't make my hair look greasy
you can't even get them sucked up into the plunger
it's my new jam!
i don't use it as often as i'd like to
it's not greasy at all
makes me look like an oil slick
it is light enough so my skin completely drinks it up
powder- it's so hard to make my makeup look good regardless of the fact that i've replicated every beauty video i've seen for dry skin application
it's such a luxurious feeling to have something like this in your beauty routine
it's not greasy at all
absorbs into your skin like no other product you've tried
it doesn't brake me out or clog my pores my skin has honestly never looked
can't believe my night shift bags
when i get a sample especially when it's eye products i like to try it on one side
my under eye makeup wasn't as smooth
i rarely get dark circles under my eyes
when i wake up i don't feel as though i need to immediately throw on bb cream or concealer just to get rid of the tired morning look
it goes on a little tacky for me
it's not greasy either.
it often seems like nothing can protect it from losing its moisture
but let's face it, $69 is expensive for a mask.
pros: one use and you'll see a difference.
fun to apply and peel off.
the peeling part does not hurt at all
if you don't apply a thick enough layer
it won't peel off easy so use a generous amount
the peeling skin makes it impossible to apply makeup
i don't think it is strong or adhesive enough to clear pores-i haven't found anything that does that except for a pore strip
it firms my skin and i love that its a peel off!
since i have super oily skin i didn't need that one so we traded
it's not just the silver/chrome look to it
it's not over powering though.
because usually i can't h
it's not some miracle mask that is going to transform your face with one use
you do have to put it on kind of thick
my only complaint is that you have to layer it on kind of thick
i don't have sagging skin yet
you have to use it as a peel off mask
love this mask my skin is sooo smooth after i peel it off
not only does it make you look like a cool tin man
it is a bit sticky going on
you get to peel it off
it doesn't apply to the skin easily
just the peeling alone seems like it is a good exfoliator
you definitely need a brush for application though
when i want my skin to look extra flawless
over time it's not good for your skin
if you do not have a mask brush i think a basic dense flat founation brush is totally ok to use
yes the price tag is a bit extreme
wasn't hard to peel off my pores looked smaller
even though i didn't think i applied enough product it still peeled off nicely
even though i wasn't sure i'd put a thick enough layer on
didn't feel the need to put a moisturizer on right away
it's not like your jowls or double chin are going to disappear
which doesn't happen with other peel off masks
i don't even like face masks
the brush that you get feels like something you would get at the dollar store
maybe it's the skin tightening effects
maybe it's scaring the dog with a silver face
there is this little tingeling sensation while it's on
only problem was that it's alittle over priced.
can't wait to try to other face masks.
if you want the mask to peel off more easily
i do wish it had more of a pore cleaning effect like the boscia mask
although it's on the pricey side
making me appear greasy
skin looks like i have makeup on
wouldn't recommended wearing under full coverage because the serum does feel a little tacky after application
the only thing it doesn't do is moisturize
however this may change in the summer when my skin is naturally more oily
no joke, forget every other sun burn remedy.
my skin got really flaky
from using a cheap drugstore cleanser that was too harsh
you apply it underneath a moisturizer or wear alone
in lieu of letting my face simply peel
moisturizers tend to frustrate me because they either sit on top of my skin without absorbing
doesn't burn my skin since i have rocesea.
like the description on the murad site it is actually like giving your skin a nice drink of water as it moisturizes
however, i really love the 22k applicator.
t can calm your skin each time when you use it
i don't even use an eye cream with this.
it can be really bothersome
i could hardly wait to put it on my eyelids
i cannot use heavy cream's around my eyes because i'm prone to millia
i will skip days not wearing eyeshadow so that my eyes can have some downtime
the product can feel a little sticky
it didn't upset my acne prone skin!
it's a super light formula
a moisturizer alone isn't enough
no idea what's in there that's made me less reptilian
i don't have to use a moisturizer anymore.
i wouldn't recommend those who get oily throughout the day to put on under makeup because it does cause you to get oiler faster
as it can irritate your skin
just let it dry long enough before you attempt to put on your makeup
therefore doesn't give me any long-lasting moisture
this does not irritate my skin at all.
if i don't wear makeup
doesn't leave it greasy or sticky
when i say acne i mean typically i have 1 pimple somewhere on my face
it does not irritate it or cause my eczema to flare up
fab's ultra repair face moisturizer over my other products that don't burn horribly
it's not just horribly ugly- the 24 lesions that look like cigarette burns are intensely moisturized without the usual burning- these products cure
knocked off one star because it doesn't do much for wrinkles or fine lines
no extra nasty ingredients to irritate the skin
its a great not-too-pricey option to boost a moisturizer ur using by layering this beneath it
put it on under my makeup or wear only this with no makeup because it's that good
the only down side is that it's so water based feeling that it's not the easiest to work into the skin
hydrates well and is not irritating in any way.
i don't even use another moisturizer because this does its work
my makeup wouldnt go on right because of the dry patches
love that is doesn't have a scent also!
it does sting a bit
it doesn't keep my dryness at bay all day
great for oily skin- hydrates your face so your skin doesn't feel like it needs to produce as many oils
flake whenever i would put makeup
it does leave my skin a little red
i really don't care considering my skin doesn't have any flakes
just sucks it into your skin
does not irritate my skin or clog my pores
it's hard finding a product that helps with my dry skin without giving me excema or breaking me out
it's not too oily or heavy
it doesn't burn my face either
irritate or even cause burning
i actually like that it stays tacky for a minute or two after sinking in
basically use it as a primer
soaks in really fast so you dont have to wait to put your moisturizer on
i really enjoy using it after a peel or mask
it feels like my skin just sucks up the moisture
it doesn't leave any kind of reside on the surface
i noticed also my skin doesn't get oily throughout the day since using it
this doesn't burn or make me break out
stuff lasts forever too.
consistency is right since i loathe the greasy feel of creams
it checks out ingredient-wise too
so soft i didn't have to wear any foundation i swear
even though it doesn't completely remove the bags
one pump does the trick.
doesn't make my face feel like a leather boot
my face didn't burn while using it
i don't use it as a body wash
let me tell you that it's way better then the beauty blender brush cleanser
this is the first product in the line that didn't make me itchy
i would love it if fab would bring out another bar with the red clay in it for those prone to mild breakouts as well
recently i've been feeling like the body wash i use is so fragrant that it might not actually be cleaning as well as i like
which other bar soaps often leave
what i look for in a soap/wash is something that will not irritate my skin
doesn't crease or cake.
it's a buy for those with uneven texture
not bothered by acne
i rarely wear makeup on my face
i don't know if it is this or the firming corset cream that makes a difference
this serum is not oil based which i like because it doesn't leave my face shiny
it's almost non existent.
my face doesn't feel tight
not at all sticky
i love skin products with any kind of tea in them
i don't have many skin problems
the dispenser gives you just the right amount of product so you don’t overuse
i've looked around for an eye cream that doesn't give me a bad reaction
i don't get enough sleep as i should so using this product helps me look more awake
it's amazing how reduced the dark circles
this is no joke the only eye cream i have tried that doesn't make my eyes water like crazy
i don't have expectations that a cream can cover dark circles
it's one of the few that helps smooth the lines under my eyes
i don't really have any puffiness
and it's cooling for sure!
powder trying to find one that didn't crease or look like an old lady after baking
realized it wasn't the concealers problem--it was the eye cream
it doesn't irritate my skin
since it's not greasy the concealer goes on better
it's perfect to apply a few minutes before concealer
doesn't feel greasy at all
i didn't think i needed a daytime eye cream
this is gentle enough to not cause irritation
i often questioned if i even need bother with eye creams at all
so bad that he flakes
you'd think eye creams would be formulated as to not burn the eyes
it's not greasy at all.
i usually wash my face
i found that when i don't use this eye cream before my primer
my makeup doesn't stay on as long
doesn't look as flawless
won't lose it's potency
doesn't really do anything besides hydrate under your eyes
can't speak on wether or not it works for puffiness or wrinkles
the packaging is cute, but it's so dysfunctional.
was worried it wouldn't moisturize my eye area like i needed it to
make it impossible to use concealer in my under eye area
it doesn't irritate my skin at all
it's an all around eye cream
you don't see a lot of eye creams that do this much
overtime i think it does add moisture to your eye area
it did seem to give me a little plumpness around the eye
it didn't give me any of those little white bumps that heavier eye creams can cause
that's what your night eye cream is for
this is just like a drink of water for under your eyes for instant plumping
i don't have much dryness to my skin except what i cause myself from acne
hydrates around my eyes like nothing else i've tried
i will say the packaging does kind of suck because you have to untwist the tip to get the cream out
the eye cream does work for my undereyes
i no longer have flakey skin
doesn't irritate my eyes like a lot of of other eye creams do
the only thing i didn't like is the weird applicator/packaging
its a nice little cream to carry in your satchel or have with you to use throughout the day
i don't recommend using this product if you have on foundation with a setting powder as it will show every wrinkle under your eyes almost like it melts away your concealer
if your not wearing any makeup
i find it to be incredibly moisturising without feeling heavy or drippy
i don't have dark circles
i only use eye creams when they are free or deluxe samples because i don't feel like shelling out extra cash for a small pot of cream
not only does this hydrate
it does burn when it gets into your eyes or if you get it into your waterline so be precise with your application
it does not have an spf which meant that if i was leaving the confort of the shade i had to wear a sunblock
i actually like the option of not having spf in my face creams
makes your face not so greasy either
does not look greasy.
i do love the way it glides on.
how it doesn't feel thick or oily
it's definitely worth the price for someone like me with dry acne prone skin who needs to start combating wrinkles
it's a heavier feeling cream to the touch
i always have 1 of these eye creams at all times
doesn't run into my eyes
my skin doesn't look tired
either way, i recommend this eye cream!
best of all it doesn't migrate so my eyes don't sting or get teary later on
i can only imagine how oily it'll get if i don't
i like this because it's been hard to find a daytime moisturizer with an spf of 30 or more
does not cause milia on my skin
i really like the squeeze tube packaging
wish it's cheaper too, it's kinda expensive.
i never thought about their moisturizer because i thought it would be super oily for my type of skin
it is non-greasy and not at all sticky.
didn't make y skin break out
even under my makeup
can't yet make a comment on anti aging because with any anti aging cream or serum etc it takes a whole to actually see results
i like that it is spf 30
this is not only gentle on my skin
we just need to give it the moisturizer it craves
i rarely get a pimple these days
if i do it is because i do something silly like sleep with makeup on
it does not have an overpowering smell.
does not irritate my skin
i do wear a little bit of lotion underneath on some days
it doesnt feel too heavy or greasy or have a strong smell
easy to carry and not greasy at all.
it isn't too sticky
if your skin isn't sensitive, it's fabulous.
it's a little thicker than some moisturizers
it doesn't feel greasy
which i liked a great deal as it doesn't trigger redness
beware if you get in your eyes because it burns
you can't see pores or lines or anything
skip a real primer which will just pill up on me all of the time anyways
i've never cared for moisturizer's with sunscreen because for me it's an added ingredient i don't need
it doesn't take away from the miracle that is this moisturizer
it was a little too heavy for my oily
it doesn't cause me to have breakouts
you only need a dime size drop to moisturize the face
it does not make my skin oily looking
this stuff will be your salvation
my make up doesn't get cakey when i use this product
it's not thick either
it doesn't turn my face greasy even in the afternoon
it doesn't interfere with my makeup
not greasy on my combination skin
anyone with acne or acne-prone skin can tell you that they're a little afraid of moisturizers
it's exactly what your skin needs to counteract the dry/flaky stage of the murad acne system
treatments in it so you are more apt to use it because you are not having to apply 5 different serums/creams before getting on with your day
i like that it's got the spf 30
then i don't have to worry about another step of putting on sunscreen
it works wonders- full moisture no mess
this moisturizer does not irritate or cause breakouts
it comes in a tube which i like
its not too greasy, its perfect for my skin type.
not too heavy because my skin can be greasy
not overpowering at all
it's not greasy either.
it's not greasy really hyrates the skin.
it doesn't go on greasy
isn't greasy at all
i no longer have to use any other type of make-up or creams except some blush
not at all greasy
make my skin itch or break out
puffy as they usually are
i love this product, but without the pads.
it works it's magic
i don't have time or money to waist on products that don't work
don't yet have wrinkles
you put 3 pumps of cream under your eyes it doesn't need a pad that size to cover
it seems that most products can't touch this problem
i don't really have crows feet
this doesn't replace your eye cream as it is a treatment
so don't skip your eye cream-i'm obsessed with renewing eye cream from this br
and it's got 40 treatment pads in there!!
this makes my skin look like a baby's.
feels like it's filling in the wrinkles
even with my nars primer
whatever you call it it smoothed my skin
i love to use this mask as a primer before i do my makeup
of course it is nothing like fillers
don't really deal with wrinkles
it made my skin look as if there was no problems underneath my makeup
it does tingle when you first apply it
i am certainly not ready for any sort of needles nor inject-able fillers
i apply this with my fingers so that the product can melt into my skin
i don't have really deep wrinkles
everyone's skin is different
i should've not overdone it with applying the sample packet all over my neck cause dang the price did scared me
i didn't know i needed a brush
this stuff is straight up voodoo magic.
maybe it's all in my head
i still can't see that line between my brows
i definitely prefer this over wrinkle creams if you want instant results
it's even making the lines around my eyes i hardly noticed there before disappear
i can't speak for its anti-wrinkle properties
my only complain is that it doesn't moisturize.
doesn't even clog my pores like most products do.
it didn't try or make me oily
i did notice that if i apply too much i get flaking
it really helps with under the eye hollows too.
it has a cooling feeling to eat it's not for everyone
it's not a miracle cream that erases time
forehead wrinkles that seem to show up no matter what primer/foundation/setting powder i use
even without makeup it's sooo visibly
although it is drying they require you to use a moisturizer afterwards which some reviewers that we're concerned about they dryness should do
i swear you can feel it tingling
really it's not expensive considering what other creams
you can apply a little moisturizer if needed.
the fact it doesn't feel heavy/ greasy
i can't stop touching my face it stays soft all day
doesn't feel too heavy
while i don't have any wrinkles
usually any product like this leaves me covered in black heads
haven't used skin care for a couple of months after buying a moisturizer that didn't agree with my skin
this stuff is the only cream i've found that actually gives me a lasting glow
this does not leaving my face greasy
i only got this because i was bored of using my other lancôme creme
the new oils that are supposed to not clog your pores
this cream is exactly the moisture level i need
it doesn't quite cut it
guess i'll be spending my paycheck on face creams
yet no greasy feel
it's pricey in my mind
there's nothing that compares to this!.
don't really have any wrinkles
even at home facials will do bc even i sometimes don't have the time
in search of a good moisturizer which would head off all the little wrinkles that seem to be cropping up every day
it does nothing for wrinkles
it is like bionic or something it makes my skin look
it didn't do anything for the really deep lines on my forehead
where it's too hot
doesn't sit on my skin.
it's incredible that i am able to use such a rich cream for day without turning into an oily mess
because so many creams do that to me
it doesn't make me breakout like all other lotions do
it's a little pricy for me
don't forget to use it on those wrinkles that are under your eyes
it doesn't feel sticky after applying
my only qualms with this product is it's packaging
it's so silky and you don't need much of it!!
you'll fall in love as well
even with the eyelids i can tell a difference
does not irritate the eye
because of the consistency you also won't get those little white bumps you usually get eventually with cream formulations
doesn't just sit on the skin
it doesn't irritate my eye area
skin because it doesn't add any weight or slickness
it's gentle so you won't experience any peeling side effects
it did a good job of cleaning out pores
i cannot speak about lightening dark spots
i can't wait for my flawless skin to return
i can't believe how smooth my skin is getting.
what have you been using on your scars?
you'll have to trust me
i do agree with some other reviewers that the spray bottle is a bit odd
the flawlessness doesn't last all day
i do get the occasional pimple
it is so silky it almost doesn't feel like skin.
my skin doesn't burn and has not peeled.
don't bother washing it off
i don't notice any real scent either
i can look greasy
there is oily residue left behind which i don't bother trying to wipe them off completely
i don't even wash it off really
this mask didn't cause any breakouts
my skin doesn't look so tired
i do love that it's in squeeze tube so that it doesn't dry out like the glam glow
it's not really runny
does it get rid of pores?
it doesn't fare in comparison to the valmont pack
the glamglow burns a little on my skin when i first apply which i don't even mind
so my skin is not red or irritated after using it
it's gentle enough to use everyday
my skin has a tendency to be a bit on the dryer side
it doesn't even have a strong smell
not even full-on pimples
it's in that season where my skin is oily in the tzone
i tend to get these deep
moisturizer wasn't doing the trick
don't like harsh products
it doesn't overdry my face
you can use the tinyest amount, get major lather.
if i wear makeup
love the smell too.
with this bad boy i don't have to worry about my face pealing or blemishing
i don't use this everyday.
however, it is usually and free of blemishes.
you only need a pea size amount to clean your whole face which is great because it ain't cheap
it doesn't work overnight
you only need a little and it rinses off nice.
maybe because i don't have regular breakouts
it's good paired with the actual exfolikate exfoliator
didn't cause me any redness or sensitivity
i don't think i have ever had a face wash clean my skin as well as this cleanser
your skin will love you
the only thing is my skin changes often
it isn't harsh on your skin at all so you can use it daily
by breakout i don't mean a few big pimples
dozens of tiny little bumps that you can't extract
i usually avoid foaming face washes because they're drying
it has made a difference with my hormonal acne when nothing else has
drug store doesn't clean as well as this does.
has just the slightest bit of scrubbiness to it for not being a physical exfoliator
it always makes me sneeze
otherwise, it's a great product.
i could not find a cleanser that would help shrink my pores
without my clarisonic depending on how much exfoliation i need at the moment
if you put in the work to use this with a sponge religiously
it does not strip my skin of all its oil
fragil skin without harsh ingredients to get the job done
i sometimes forget to moisturize because it's so good at not drying out my combined skin
i think this will leave your skin looking clean
not sure whether it's the cleanser or a mask i've been using
only need a small amount to get a great lather
it doesn't make your face feel dry
t doesn't get stale
only because sometimes it's stress or hormone triggered
i didn't like rough exfoliators.
do you notice your make up peels
this is gentle enough to use every day
it does sting if you accidentally get it in them
doesn't burn or sting my sensitive skin
feels like there is slimy residue even when i completely wash it off
it does wash all of the oil
i recommend this to every skin type i am more normal/combo skin type not too many problems occasional oily t zone
is somehow is still very oily
rosacea it sure did the trick
it's citrus scent of pineapple makes me want to eat this every time i use it
it's the kind of scent to make you forget about life's stresses
i know people say you shouldn't look for fancy cleansers because they are on your skin for such a short amount of time
i honestly do notice a difference in my skin depending on what i cleanse with
it magically does not dry my skin out
i am so used to either feeling clean
do not irritate my skin
it legit feels like a mini facial at home.
i gave it 4 stars because i do believe it helped with my adult acne the slightest bit
be extra careful not to get it in your eyes because man oh man it stings
foams ups just a little bit and has a fair smell.
i don't even feel like i need moisturizer when i use this
not too rude to my skin
if that isn't proof this stuff can clean out your pores i dunno what is
the literally sucks the oil right out your skin.
know the ingredients are getting into my skin
i also like how it lathers
using this stuff has not irritated my skin
it doesn't leave my skin dry either which other products tend to do
i follow up with a good moisturizer even though my skin is oily
it's amazing at controlling oil
the first time i used it i could feel it sucking out all of the oil in my face
or whenever i feel i need a bit of "extra" clean for my skin
most cleansers i've tried do a pretty good job of soaping up your face
dull skin you need this oil
i usually wear a lot of makeup
wasn't taking proper care of my skin so my pores were the size of china
a little goes a long way because it's super foamy
this cleanser does just that
no crazy scrubbing needed.
i do agree it can dry out your face if used 2x daily
it's really nice because it doesn't dry your skin out
with little or no air bubble
when i took the patches off i couldn't believe that the wrinkles i have tried a million different creams
can't wait to finish the treatment
doesn't clogg my pores like another of creams do.
as we get older our skin gets dryer.
i'll add that since i've been using this product i don't seem to need foundation--just a dusting of powder
this product is not greasy at all
replacing my old moisturizer made me realize just how dry my face actually is
it's easy to go overboard
it loses some of it's body as it settles
i can apply a thick layer at night for those days my skin needs a little more love
it did not leave an oily feel
i put it on my skin even when i have a bunch of breakouts
i feel they're soothed by the morning
it doesn't make me feel greasy at all
this moisturizer pills like crazy when used over another product no matter how long i let it sink in
it's all i need
sometimes i'll add a little bit of argan oil
which can be annoying
cardboard all day which seriously sucks the moisture out of my skin
it'll feel like it's sitting on your skin instead of soaking into it
it's not heavy at all
to the point where i get flaky skin at times
not too heavy on my combo skin
it's really light weight
doesn't make my skin feel oily
it does make your skin feel a little oily when you apply it
not giving it enough moisture because i thought i had "oily skin"
it's soaks right into my skin
doesn't feel oily or sticky
it doesn't leave my skin shiny
because i tend to get shiny in my t-zone during the day i use this at night
this cream makes me look like i have normal skin!
don't be scared because it's worth the moisture
doesn't irritate my skin at all
i could skip wearing makeup thanks to this product
serums i use underneath so they don't dissipate
doesn't make me feel greasy
i even use it as my nighttime eye cream.
the scent doesn't bother me
don't rub or use too much
there is no bad scent to this product.
doesn't look or make me feel oily.
even though you can use it in the daytime too
it doesn't clog my pores or feel heavy on my skin
there also isn't a smell.
it's surprisingly light on your face
it doesn't clog my pores which mine tend to clog very easily
hasn't made it feel greasy
it has a tendency to make my face shiny
am thinking in the winter i might have to layer this with some oil
dinging it one star because it definitely leaves a sheen -- it's too much for day
the pores on my nose aren't clogged anymore
it does not make my skin oily.
requesting a sample of it first to try with your skin since it seems some people's skin had funky reactions to it
using both products does not make your face oily
it goes on nicely and dries so it's not oily.
it doesn't have any smell
didn't like the texture
won't absorb because it's a mask so
it goes on like a cream
so freaking soft compared to the omany other hydrating face masks that i've tried
i don't get oily or anything
keeping oily skin well hydrated actually helps lessen oil production because it tricks your skin into thinking it doesn't need it
i usually find the smells of masks not too appealing
this does not cause my skin to flare
i feel like i don't have to wear make-up after i use this mask
sometimes with holy grail beauty products you get a terrible smell
it doesn't make me oiler
it doesn't dry out my skin like so many other products do
the downside is that you really have to rinse it off or it leaves behind greasy residue
i considered taking a star off because it's pricey for the amount you get
this mask is everything if you want glowy
i took one star off because it's pretty sticky.
it was hard for me to leave such a sticky product on my face without wanting to wash it off immediately
enough to do the job as a scrub
i hate how other exfoliators are so gentle there is no exfoliating happening just more chunky
just heavy-duty enough to get all of the dead skin off without irritating my skin
this does an amazing job without irritating or drying me out
i probably wouldn't recommend using it more often than that because you might over exfoliate
not having to worry if the products will fall or drip off of my face
i find that a lot of exgoliators only keep your skin soft for like a day or so
scrub junkie so having this product be both was a bonus
fyi if you put this near your lower nose or upper lip you may get itchy bc of the sugar chunks being near a highly sensitive to feeling area
i rarely actually get pleasure form touching my face
it doesn't dry right up so you can actually still move your face
and it doesn't take a lot of water to wash off!!!
the little beads actually wash off
so you're not washing your face another 5 times trying to remove them
the scrub is not harsh at all
i can't be without this mask!!
people who are creeped out by texture might want to put it on with some type of mask applicator
this "polishing mask" completely gets rid of any flakey
you'll see the results instantly.
i tend to get some pre congestion on my nose
not sticky and it comes off easily with water.
i am not one to splurge on masks
usually use it after i wash my face
it's like having a mini face lift
it's gentle and did not irritate my combo skin.
this product didn't irritate my skin
not buying the full size because i don't feel like i would be using this very often since it dries out my skin
it's polishes my skin so well i can get pass the minor weird smell
i would love it if they'd put it in a squeeze tube for hygiene purposes
almost don't want to wash it off
though it's not going to over a problem for those with oily skin like myself
most cleanser that i tried in the past were too harsh or too oily on my face
doesn't moisturize as much as i would like
the only thing i dislike is the smell
i think this cleanser does a good job of removing makeup
it never feels like it's dried me out
it doesn't get super sudsy
it's good for oily skin
the cleanser did a good job of removing every bit of dirt
know that it really does cleanse
it never drys my skin out or causes break outs.
note: it doesn't have any acne preventing ingredients
try it and you'll love it.
yet it removes all of my makeup
yes even the many coats of mascara that have set on my eyes for 12-15 hours that day
you'll definitely notice a difference in tone
i tend to get red
my skin will either be irritated or my pores will become super clogged
i don't smell anything unusual while wearing it.
can't see a difference in my pore size
i don't think the smell is bad at all.
it's causing so many pimples that i normally don't deal with
i didn't get a pimple over night.
i don't mind the smell at all!
doesn't break out as often
didn't have the burning skin feel nor made my face red
it's a pretty good mask if you can suffer through the initial shock to your nasal passages
most masks you usually have to really scrub at to get it off
i dont think the smell is as bad or intense as some are making it seem
ive found that when i go in with a pore strip after rinsing this mask off soooo much more "gunk" comes out of my pores
zero residue feelings like you may get from other products
doesn't get hard on your face
it's not drying at all!!
i subtracted 1 star only because it has an unpleasant smell which is not great when it's sitting on your face for 20 minutes
just got it on a whim because i love the charcoal makeup remover from this line
couldn't believe all the impurities it took out of my skin
i couldn't believe how many impurities were brought to the skin
usually all masks irritate unless i make it on my own
it doesn't get tight
the smell is not bad
it's hard for me to like a face mask
the most annoying thing about my face is the oily areas
my face isn't so red
plussss it doesn't make my face feel oily
i literally wake up feeling like i don't even need to wash my face haha
seem to help bring it all to the surface.
maybe it will help with my oily t-zone.
this mask does wonders to my skin.
sometimes i leave it on for more than 20 minutes because i'm too lazy to walk to the bathroom to wash it off
yet my skin still doesn't feel tight nor dry
it doesn't bother me or irritate my skin in any way
i don't feel that this is too drying or too harsh
i've grown to actually like it's scent
i really like the smell of the product it's very subtle
you don't need much to cover your entire face
it's not too distracting to take away from the high quality product
i tend to use the mask at night
i didn't realize how much my skin needed the white charcoal too
the best pore mask that doesn't leave your skin feeling dehydrated
usually if i just use toner along with this product it works fabulously
not marshmallow 18 year old cheap stuff
i think lancer doesn't realize that their comical markups are costing them because i don't think i'm alone in removing this from my cart because of the cost
this stuff is pricy
it's the only product i've found that gives me that dewy
it doesn't necessarily cover up major imperfections
it's definitely not inexpensive
makeup would stick and look dark.
serious peeling) and so gentle it did nothing.
one star off only because it's expensive.
this product diffidently does it's job.
worth the results you will love how chloe your skin looks towards our tighten wrinkles slowly reduce love this product also helps with acne i do use it day
the whining about the smell
it doesn't wear off
has really taken my skin from oily/combo to almost normal
this is not too heavy and makes my makeup glow.
this has become a can't skip part of my morning ritual
my skin isn't in need of repair
i really wish they'd bring back their old line of skin cleansers
not greasy at all!
doesn't cause my makeup to slide around
u can just tell your face has just been packed with nutrients
doesn't disturb the makeup i put on top of it
makes my pores practically disappear
it's a new favorite just don't freak out when you breakout for a bit
not at all greasy
i rarely get pimples
makeup goes on so smooth
i am not acne prone at all
have to think that maybe this is clogging my pores?
when i'm not wearing makeup
just don't overdo it
it is not sticky at all
i am not a huge fan of bare minerals makeup
does not leave my skin feeling oily or tacky.
i usually have to stick to fragrance free products
i love that it doesn't feel greasy or sticky like so many other serums i've used
it will not make you feel oily either.
it did not work on my acne-prone combo skin
won't be purchasing the truth serum anymore- this as replaced it for sure
there's enough to go on for your face
i feel like it's a little less oily lately
didn't brake me out in acne
you don't feel oily after.
i really almost don't even need a moisturizer after using it
f you're sensitive to scents you might want to steer clear of this product
or wherever else you put the salve moisture
you do need to put quite a lot of salve on wherever you choose to put the product on cos it is a little thin
i love this lip balm so much i just repurchased it
i don't use it as a moisturizer because i find the texture to be too thick
t tends to rub off if you eat or drink after applying it
i like to use it on natural makeup days when i'm not wearing lipstick
you can use this salve anywhere on your body
and don't even get me started on my cuticles!!
my lips never feel as chapped anymore
it really melts down when you apply it
considering how thick it is in the pot it really thins out when you apply it
it actually is almost like coconut oil!
you can't even smell it
it even works as an eye cream
like i have really crazy oily skin
this does not break me out or make me feel oily or heavy
it doesn't leave a weird greasy feeling or look
i still use this on my face as a hydrator
i don't have excessive oil production anymore
it's great to use in lieu of the face gloss since it isn't as heavy
acne prone skin here
i tend to avoid anything with "oil" in the description
has never felt oily nor have i felt any residue
i tend to just use this stuff under my eyes
but i really hate the applicator.
the only bad thing is sometimes it takes a while to get the rollerball to distri
if i could buy a giant tub of this stuff
i almost never use oils- they usually feel heavy on skin
i don't usually use oils because they either break out my skin
it soaks in well so that you don't look or feel "oily"
i now use the stuff religiously
i actually like the rollerball.
i don't use it on my face
can't speak about the rollerball
applying this under my foundation doesn't make my skin any more oily
doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy at all
regardless if i used a good primer or not my eyeshadows still looked a pit patchy
this somehow helps keeping it less oily in the long run
it's got a citrus smell that isn't too strong.
doesn't leave my skin greasy
did not leave any greasy residue
doesn't clog my pores
keep it in my travel makeup bag because it's so versatile
the light smell is so nice and doesn't linger.
it doesn't run all over considering it's an oil
irritate or break it out
if milk's sunshine oil doesn't clash with your perfume then i imagine it would work great in hair
it doesn't drip or run all over
the scent doesn't linger
the smell doesn't linger so don't let that stop you from buying it
it doesn't leave an oil slick behind when applied
i even sometimes put it on my cheekbones as a glowy- highlight
omg i've only been using the hydrating oil stick for a few weeks
the strange thing is that i don't find it very oily
or my skin absorbs it really quick
thought it might be sort of gimmicky
it's basically just condensed oil you rub onto your skin
since i tend to have a very oily t zone
with my combo skin i rarely find a product i like that does not break me out or leave my skin feeling greasy in some spots
it is very simple to use because i just use the stick to rub it all over my face
want to give it a try to milk makeup oil
i don't used acne products anymore
there bad for my skin
i don't need fancy packaging.
you could wear this on your own for a dewy look if you have dry skin
it does stay kinda greasy
it's not heavy at all
it doesn't give any weird smell.
i also love that the container doesn't get that gross oily feeling that i thought it would
i don't use with makeup
it's lightweight when you apply it
it's just the smell
i hope it's because of the ingredients.
it's a cool thing to try
it makes you look glowy rather than oily
it doesn't have a smell nor does it irritate my eyes
gives you an easy way to apply a little bit of moisture anywherefor those seeking an easy to use facial oil that’s mess-free
it's so lightweight i love putting it on.
it's not greasy and it's very light.
it's an oil in stick form.. genius!
it's not super greasy yet it doesn't disappear.
it doesn't affect my eyeliner either
it doesn't cause my mascara to get weird or melty
i wasn't sure if it would be hydrating enough or if it would only make my oily skin look shiner
i can even get away with just this as my moisturizer
this cute little twist up has done wonders for my makeup routine
it does smell like some kind of oil
the best part is it doesn't leave your skin shiny or oily
use a pore filler because this doesn't fill in pores
it's insanely hot right now
i can't wait to throw it in my bag
just a little dewy all day
which is a hard thing to come across without using super oily products on my skin
it's not sticky and absorbs well.
if you need a light moisturizer on the go this is not a bad option
i find this to be too oily for my whole face if i try to leave it on
i don't refrigerate either because i don't like things that are too cold
it is a little bit sticky
it feels so cold once you apply to your skin.
the stick applicator makes it really easy to put all over my face without having to dip my fingers into a pot or dirty them with serums
initially i didn't like it because it's not all that blendable with your h
doesn't take a lot to give the the cooking sensation as it says
if you let it sit it gets tacky
did not leave my skin feeling greasy or oily at all
didn't make my oiler areas greasy at all
i wouldn't use this in place of a moisturizer though
it's a little bit tacky
t helped keep my concealer on for a really long time
if you travel a lot or have combo skin this is for you
it's like a refresher for your skin.
the only down side is that it's not really a moisturizer
however if you're a makeup junkie
are into using stuff like this before your moisturizer
i do not like putting this all over my face because there is a slight sticky feeling that comes with it
who doesn't crave cool refreshement?
i don't burn easy
a nice addiction to any skin routine
it does leave your skin a little sticky
even not in the fridge it still has a cooling sensation
not only does it help with puffiness if helps me get out of bed
sometimes i put it on once i remove my makeup just for that cool soft feeling
it really didn't cool or moisturize my face
in need of a cool zap
i can't say if this product has a treatment affect on puffiness/dark circles/etc
i don't keep it in the fridge
it's not like a menthol based product in any way.
it doesn't smell like mint
or makeup of any sort on her face
it is not sticky or tacky in my opinion
it's works to sooth areas on my face that are irritated
i don't rub or pat it into the skin
it's really satisfying to twist the cap off the stick
it doesn't really hydrate
sometimes i apply it to my lips
mediocre product that doesn't live up to its st
don't have to smell it
as far as working as a primer for makeup it isn't the best for my combination skin as it obviously doesn't cancel any oiliness
i wouldn't recommend wearing it under makeup
my first thoughts were that it seemed gimmicky
i mostly use mine to make my skin texture a bit tacky so my foundation appears more dewy
i can't notice it changing my face or pores in any way
it's an instant pick me up!
it's amazing for underneath your eyes
it's works wonders against my super dry skin
normally i don't wear a moisturizer under my make up
does not leave my skin feeling greasy
it actually sinks into my skin
just an average face lotion that will not clog your pores or make you break-out
the only reason why i didn't give it 5 stars was i felt it left my skin a tiny bit dry
other products seem to break me out
especially if it's a hyped-up product
if you want a moisturizer you can use morning
this is so light weight it doesn't bother my sensitive skin
perfect for oily skin or those bothersome t-zone areas
it's not heavy like some moisturizers
it doesn't even have a strong smell
it also doesn't make my face dry out even more or get really oily
it's just perfect for people with acne prone combination skin
it doesn't make your skin any less oily
t's hard to find a lotion that doesn't worsen that during the day
it has given me moisture without causing my skin to be overly greasy or having any new blemishes appear
it smells like plastic when you put it on
their use of good ingredients that don't irritate or inflame my skin
although if you like using oils
it's a pretty price to pay for moisturizer
please try it if you are suffering from acne
it does not clog my pores
i love that it doesn't make my skin oily
i only wish it did some work to help reduce the inflamed acne on my cheeks
doesn't seem to be as shiny even when i don't apply for a day or two
i mean my skin is super oily that you can see the shine glowing
so my skin doesn't flake or peel like it usually does with other products
i don't wake up shiny- all 3 miracles
immediately there's no more redness or itch
i do not think that it is for only people with oily skin because it hydrates my awful
it doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy
does not clog my pores
i usually love murad products
nice texture and not too oily.
not very heavy for my oily face can wear it pm
i don't feel like my skin becomes any oilier because of it
everything gave me breakouts because they were all too thick
it doesn't clog my pores
since it doesn't have spf
not oily at all and doesn't cause breakouts.
it doesn't really control oil
i naturally have weird skin.
the lotion is light so did not feel greasy at all
it's easy to say skin type
does not encourage blemishes
it's greatsmells good, like coconut?
i wouldn't use this in the day because it makes me look shiny
i can't say that it reduces acne
my face definitely doesn't get as oily when i'm using this
doesn't irritate my skin
there because you have oily skin…try this
it may seem quite oily when first applying
not crazy oily like before
is not sticky or makes me feel oily
i don't have too many blemishes either
whether you have blemishes
i think if i wasn't using acne products
i needed something that would help with my acne-prone skin
they didn't wow me on products for oily skin
not too thick, or greasy.
doesn't make my skin worse
it does not feel oily in the summer
the tone of my skin is even
it never feels heavy or greasy
it may not be mattifying like the oil-free mattifier
it's as perfect as a lotion can be
my skin never feels greasy.
i liked this moisturizer quite a bit: it's not oily or heavy
it is not a bad smell
the only con though is that it makes my nose look really shiny
it also doesn't make me feel greasy in the morning
it really is good, it does control the oily skin.
the feeling of any moisturizer even oil-free just feels so gross
although i love how good salicylic acid is clearing acne i feel as though in a moisturizer it's a bit redundant
i don't mean this to sound like an infomercial
this lotion didn't just help
i don't have any problem with my skin flaking anymore
not greasy or heavy at all
you don't need much to cover your entire face
it doesn't do anything for acne scars
it's hard to tell if that's due to me sweating more as the weather warms up or if it's related to trying a new face wash as well
i find that once i start to get warm or oily later in the day that this doesn't do a very good job of controlling oil at that point
doesn't make the problem of acne worse
it doesn't leave your skin greasy
if i want to use it in the evening as part of makeup cleansing
since i don't really need extra moisture under my face masks
certianly not necessary to your routine if you already cleanse
when i'm too lazy or it's too hot to layer my fancier creams on
it's helped with the longevity of my make up
it also seems to amp up my gel like masks
especially if you want your regular toner to last longer
i couldn't get over the nagging feeling to buy this
nothing gimmicky about that!
i know it's a mask primer
not to mention i don't have to rub my face raw to get drying masks off anymore
i really don't use a pre-treatment when i use a mask
those with skin that doesn't get dry math not see much difference
even if you don't want a primer for facial masks
so, yes, it's gimmicky.
if you don't have chronic skin issues like me
it's a gimmick in my opinion
even if if your a 2-3 times a week mask junkie like me
this seems a bit gimmicky to start
got 5+ times the amount of gunk on the pore strip than i usually do
literally sucks every single thing out of your pores
i can't wait to see if it does the same with peel off masks
it's easier to apply mask
when it comes to skin care
it didn't affect the drying time of my mask
only thing knocking it is i have acne prone skin
if used with an exfoliator it would probably be perfect
i seriously love this cleansing gel so much.
tarte uses such good for you ingredients that i never have to worry
i am a red hair enough said
normally i face gets red when i wash it
it doesn't burn my eyes or irritate my sensitive skin
even if it's just packaging
i noticed that my skin doesn't break out with this cleanser
it does not do a good job removing non-waterproof mascara
it's the only cleanser that won't rip my skin
someone said dog shampoo, and that's exactly it.
takes off your makeup without making my face feel super tight
this is not a harsh cleanser at all.
these do not remove makeup or feel super clean
i don't get any overwhelming scent
this gives me no irritation at all
i cannot get over the smell
it literally smells like dog shampoo which isn't bad it's just not something i like to smell as i'm washing my face
doesn't leave a soapy residue to skin either.
doesn't leave my face tight or irritated afterwards
it really gets rid of makeup
doesn't burn the eyes or anything
i don't use this to remove my makeup
it doesn't leave it feeling oily
glowy without leaving a greasy residue over my skin which is one of the main things i like about it
i can't stop touching my face!
when i use my face cloth to scrub i can see all of the makeup that didn't come off with the wipes
i just didn't feel like it was cleaning deep enough
it's my go to cleanser
it does take a little longer to rinse off than a regular foaming face wash
i think it's because of the liquid to foam consistency
does leave your skin baby
for the bad after smell i just use some toner
removes any makeup your makeup wipe didn't get off
my skin isn't over producing oil anymore throughout the day
the smell of this cleanser doesn't bother me at all
only need 3 small pumps to get a really good lather
if you don't like foamy soaps then this isnt for you
reliable natural cleanser that doesn't smell horrible
doesn't break me out or irritate my skin in any way
it melts off all my makeup including benefit's they're real mascara
plus, it doesn't have perfum, but it smells good.
my makeup doesn't melt off any more
even greasy in certain areas of my face
it takes off all or my makeup which is mostly water proof
i typically use clinique's take the day off balm when i have makeup on
this is the only thing i found that removes my makeup
i apply it with the tarte pink scrubbie it really helps with getting the cleanser deeper in your skin
it's not fragrance free
acne prone skin who say this doesn't work for them
i cannot stress enough how great this cleanser is
also doesn't leave my skin oily.
i did however notice how well this took off my waterproof mascara
not only did it cleanse my face
it leaves my face feeling soooo clean after a long day of wearing makeup
it doesn't help with my acne scars :
don't want to waste a travel size especially it makes my face smoother without makeup on
i also love it because it gets every bit of leftover makeup off without irritating my skin
not at all overpowering
this really helped my skin become less oily.
i still enjoy using it occasionally
other face washes i have used either do not remove all of my make up or cause my face to feel dry
i wasn't sure it effectively cleaned because i didn't feel squeaky clean which is unusual compared to others i have used
i barely have any blackheads anymore !
doesn't leave my face feel "oily" after taking my makeup off
doesn't leave residue like other oils
but this one doesn't, and removes my make up too!
it washed off easily and i didn't feel dried out.
the smell makes you think tht its going to sting
have tried many different cleansing oils that feel too thick
it makes me wash my face more often before bed!
although this product may go on feeling super oily
didn't really get under the surface to remove all of my excess makeup
it doesn't sting like the others
love that it does not leave a heavy residue on my face
i can't imagine using any of my old makeup removers again after this
i like that it's not super thick.
the emollient-ness had me using quite alot to get a good slip
i wear anywhere from natural to glam makeup
it takes off all of your makeup even hard to remove waterproof mascara
not greasy at all like some cleansing oils can do
nothing has ever completely removed waterproof mascara like this does
does not burn when it gets in my eyes
i still follow up with another cleanser to make sure my skin is squeaky clean
i almost never get acne
but hey, how many cleansers moisturize your skin?
even though it's a little pricey for jobless high school kids
even takes off my mascara
if i don't use my clarisonic than i thin it out a little with water
which isn't really foam to start
it does feel different after some called it sticky
i usually use both make-up cleanser
it does leave that squeaky clean feeling afterwards so dry skinned gals might not dig it as much as i do
this product does give you somewhat of a squeaky finish
my face doesn't get greasy through the day
it's not a scrub, so it's not super harsh.
you only need a little bit of the cleanser to get a really rich lather
it does leave that sticky
it goes away in a minute especially if you use a toner to make sure there's no residue
i can't go without this cleanser now
i like the fact that it can also remove eye-makeup as long as it’s not waterproof
sorta lets you know when it's ready to be rinsed off
this wash is somehow balancing for me
it's not over drying either!
although it doesn't do as well as the old cleanser
i feel like it helps to stop my breakouts from spreading if not clearing them completely
i do feel like it isn't as deep cleaning as i would like it to be
i could still see makeup coming off when i used a toner
it lathers good if you add a little water
i am not acne prone
do get the occasional breakout
t's hard for me to find an acne-fighting cleanser that doesn't either dry out my skin or make it red
it does foam up
easily fixed if you use a good moisturizer
this has just the right amount of treatment in it where it doesnt leave my skin flaky
like it doesn't clog my pores
not sure if it has anti-aging elements
it absorbs quickly and didn't break me out.
after a couple weeks i felt my skin didn't get anywhere near as oily as usual
does not leave a greasy feeling
doesn't leave the skin feeling sticky like some gels can
it may not be enough moisture for skin that isn't normal to oily
does not clog pores
love the texture and how fast it's absorbed.
especially if you have oily or combo skin
so you can do your makeup right away
i tend to get a little flaky in the winter
shows it's flat surface which is kind of funny
it is not sticky at all so no worry about the stickiness
it's so easy to apply.
the smell isn't that bad compared to other skin creams
a lot of creams leave my face feeling greasy or as if the moisturizer doesn't set into my skin
doesn't make me feel like a grease ball
i wish i wouldn't have to dip my fingers or find an alternative to grab the product without feeling like bacteria is going inside
it doesn't break me out and super effective!
this moisturizer doesn't get as much hype as other br
it's hasn't caused me to break out
one of the ladies recommended me to get this if i like bare minerals
when i do makeup
it's rare that i break out
my skin gets super flaky once i apply make up
with lots of flaky dry patches that look horrible no matter what make up i use to try
i mean ridiculously dry skin
my skin doesn't feel greasy
for standard dry skin, it's probably fine!
not greasy or anything.
it's not as thick as my previous moisturizer
i didn't feel as though i looked oily
chin would get flaky abd with makeup it made my face look awful
you'll see definite results
other skins do not compare to my mum's she cannot wash her face with anything even if it is organic
it makes your skin look
it's almost like water, but oily.
it's not too greasy
it is spendy but it's so pretty!
at first i was just using at night because i thought it would make my skin too oily under makeup
it doesn't leave your skin feeling oily
doesn't make me extra oily
i am usually a person who skimps on moisturizer or primer or other products meant to prep you
even if at yesterday's makeup
even with the oil base my mascara doesn't run when i do add it
i tend to be red all the time
that i didn't need such a harsh cleanser
free of those annoying bumps
as i thought it would clog my pores
it's not heavy or greasy it's just perfect consistency
it's expensive but it's a winter must.
it's hard to find a good skin product that does wonders for the dry
i only use it in my night time routine so makeup or any other product/pollution doesn't disturb it
it gets really annoying to find a moisturizer that doesn't make my nose more oily
does my skin justice especially since it's winter time
the scent doesn't bother me
i wouldn't use this during the day if you are oily
it's still an all around
don't let the "oil" scare you if you have oily skin--this balances my skin out perfectly
it'd probably be too oily to use in the summer
i can also see it could be too greasy for anyone with oily skin
for me it's a plus
this product never left my skin feeling really oily or gross
only down side is i have pretty oily skin
love the non greasy finish even though it is an oil
i don't find it to be super duper hydrating on its own
it's made my skin smoother
i don't have anymore texture hyper pigmentation seems to be going away
all you need is just a few drops with your moisture
i don't get the greasy cake face
i don't use this oil everyday
this oil absorbs very quickly so your face doesn't feel oily
this stuff is magic in a bottle.
couldn't get rid of my dull
i don't wear my makeup as often
making it look like i have acne
it hasn't completely fade but it's improving.
it doesn't clog my pores at all
i even use it under foundation occasionally when i'm going a more dewy look
plus it doesn't clog my pores
i don't even need moisturizer after i use this
if you wear light makeup most days
it's just a little jarring every time i open the bottle
it does have a pretty heavy scent
the scent doesn't linger though.
as soon as it's all rubbed into your skin
double bonus: there's actual bits of roses in the jar
however there are matte powder finishes if that's not your preferred look
faint smells that decipates with time not bothersome at all
not even oily anymore
he's the oblivious type usually
i can see it helps lighten my dark spots
then i tried this: non greasy
it's difficult to keep the lids secure on the jar
seems to work like those instant wrinkle removers
you can't even close the containers all the way.
this product is pricy enough that i don't want it leaking all over my makeup bag
it's perfect for before you apply under eye concealer to highlight
this is not your normal eye cream
you'll be glad you ditched your old routine
immediately you'll feel a tightening sensation which is nice
yet lightweight because it's oil free
does not cause for my skin to be oily
light enough on the skin to wear everyday !
i usually love the smell of clarins products
acnei just with they would remove the perfumes
cannot get over how good it smells
cause i've always been afraid of moisturizers for my super oily skin
doesn't feel sticky on the face
i love how it's not too heavy
my skin doesn't feel sticky or tacky at all once i give it a minute or so to dry
my face tends to get super shiny after a few hours
t only made sense that i try their moisturizer as well
i do find this to be a little pricey- i used philosophy's take a deep breath moisturizer for years
if you're oily to normal, this is a good option.
offers some moisture but isn't overkill.
doesn't leave it feeling oily or greasy
it's not too heavy
i never liked wearing moisturizer because it always seemed to make my combo/oily skin even more oily
it literally feels like a refreshing splash of water on your face
this product doesn't irate my skin at all
if you dont wear makeup its a very nice glowy subsitute to highlighters
it's easily rubbed in
it's light so i can use this day and night!
it doesn't cause any acne or make me oily either!
i normally get so greasy
i did find it doesn't spread as nicely as my usual moisturizer
it didn't leave any kind of greasy or tacky residue
when i moisturize too often
got my daily hooked up on it the sticky part its how you know your makeup it's going to stay love it
rarely get oily so this is a game changer when it comes to the application of my foundation
i don't know what makes this moisturizer so special
doesn't leave skin feeling greasy
want to try something other then a cream moisturizer
when drying it can get a little tacky
it is tacky but i can look past that.
usually i don't like gel moisturizers because i find them sticky
sometimes i even apply my fave oils either under or over top
i feel like it soaks in immediately
doesn't leave your face feeling greasy
it feels tacky when you first put it on
i usually hate moisturizers due to their heavy feeling
when i where the moisturizer alone with mascara i get so many compliments on how healthy my skin looks
yes it does feel a little sticky
my skin doesn't peel at all
sometimes it's oily in the middle
i can't use my fresh moisturizer without it.
it's not sticky at all.
it does not leve any greasy residue.
it doesn't create milia
it's one of my staples.
this stuff sinks right into my skin.
it does wonders to your skin
i literally makes your face feel like it drank a cup of water
doesn't break me out or irritate my skin
i actually find that it keeps my oily zones in control
your face feels like glass it's so smooth
my skin was so dry i couldn't hardly wear makeup anymore
and its not oily so it doesnt make you break out.
i don't notice my tease zone as oily
don't like the texture that much
it's honestly amazing and i have super dry skin.
the inside is maybe half that due to it's design
for the first time ever i found a moisturizer that actually not only suits my very oily skin
no matter what i used i was left with flaky skin
i find sometimes that i come home covered in grease
my makeup doesn't slip
i barely need to powder really
which is saying something because i usually am greasy in some spots within the hour
it isn't as smooth
t's a struggle to find a good moisturizer that won't break me out
doesn't leave my skin feeling oily or tacky like other moisturizers
its formula doesn't leave you feeling sticky
it is just enough hydration for my face.
i can tell when i get lazy
it doesn't make my face feel oily after applying
it's better than using a vibrator on your eyelid
you have to remember to apply an eye cream first so that it doesn't tug at your skin
it doesn't do miracles on dark circles
i'd have to learn how to do proper draining massaging besides my regiment or get some kind of gadget to help things along
i know it's this because i've used the iris before the nuface
if you've been long eye bag sufferer
send them packing with this little gadget
there's no bag in sight
anyone with puffy eyes will notice the difference after even just one use
can tell that my eyes are less puffy
realize it's not the eye cream
it's super gentle and gets rid of your make up.
nothing actually got my mascara or foundation off my face
doesn't make it greasy like some other oils
if it doesn't hydrate enough, i get too dry.
it is easy to wash off
if you're just using it to remove eye makeup then there's no need to add more cleansing
you can wash your face with this
i will suggest that if you are prone to oily skin
it takes even the most stubborn mascara off!
there's still some left
make them a bit blurry after use
takes off even the most stubborn waterproof makeup
takes all the yuck off
it does not feel super oily either.
it looks like i have never put mascara on my eyelashes ever
have a flawless skin you need to either wash your face with a good soapy cleanser or you just need to use a warm cloth
you can't never put straight water on it is oil the warm cloth will do its work
let's be smart to use
i like the idea of adding moisture to my skin rather than washing it away
i don't know if i will repurchase if i can find a cleansing oil that actually cleanses
i love using this as a "skin" cleanser as opposed to removing my makeup with it because honestly
i don't have to double cleanse if i don't want to
it's not as thick as the loccitane
you need very little product to remove all of your makeup
i got this cleanser to try since every other oil cleanser felt too heavy on my skin
i do like the texture
it took a few times for me to get the right amount of product where my face wasn't greasy or not enough moisturizer
is mild enough on my face
the price might seem scary
i also like how this came with a little spatula so you don't have to touch the cream directly in the jar
also the cream doesn't irritate my eyes
while i don't have a ton of wrinkles
i love that this cream comes with a little stick to help get it out of the jar
i don't have to dig under my nails
however it does leave my skin feeling tacky
i know that the bottle does not mention spreading the cream around the neck
i like how it comes with a small spatula to gather cream from the jar instead if using your fingers
is not greasy at all
doesn't leave an oily feeling behind
because it's not thick
it is thick and i prefer to only use at night.
i like how the cream doesn't have an overpowering scent
due to sometimes having oily skin i've only been using it at night
it is the only cream i've been able to use with my combination skin that isn't greasy feeling
not getting to oily on my t zone
i don't want my skin to age to fast
the cream is heavy but not greasy.
does not leave me feeling oily
cream moisturizers can be a struggle for me because they never feel as if they dry down completely
so that's a plus for oilier skin like mine.
it didn't erase my pores
i can say that my skin looks plumper
plus it really moisturizes the skin so you'll notice less dry spots
the rna power radical new age essence moisturized my skin so well i didn't need to use a moisturizer on top
it's super easy to apply and my skin felt firmer.
it makes my skin look dewey
doesn't leave my skin feeling heavy
if you use too much you may get an oily looking face
sometimes as a makeup primer
i love the design of the bottle because the dropper is easy to use
i apply it everywhere except my nose
i know that it's a good quality bottle because it accidentally fell out of the medicine cabinet
i don't have big pores
when i started using it last fall it didn't seem to do anything except make my oily skin oilier
the other part is my skin can't seem to h
you'll feel an instant depuff
it's my little indulgence in the morning
tip: flip over the jar each time you use them so that the essence saturates evenlyi've tried many eye patches
just a tip: since they're pricy use a single patch on one eye
basically you'll be doubling your uses.
wasn't too gentle when removing makeup
it's great to use on days to pamper yourself
were my under eyes really crepe-ish no matter how much time i spent on makeup?"
i won't be needing much concealer today!
while i don't have issues with wrinkles yet
there's enough serum that i've used a bit extra after i used the patches
the only thing is that if they're too damp
i love what these patches do for my eyes!
they make great eyeshadow shields if you tuck them in far enough
rehydrates the under eye like you wouldn't believe
i yearned for a simple product to diminish them just as this product does
you can wear them
i wish there was a full facial mask like this
ptr eyes masks do not break me out
it's an amazing booster to add to your routine
i can't go to bed without using it.
sure they're a little pricy
let that rich b*tch 24k vibe kick through the door of your shady sleepless nights
i like that it's in a pump
i don't wear makeup very often anymore
it's just enough hydration and not overly greasy.
it doesn't burn my eyes if it gets too close to them
i learned that there aren't pores on this area of your skin
i hate when i notice a difference in my makeup without this eye cream
i even use it when not wearing makeup.
it's really light weight for morning use
you'll like it if you're consistent with it.
there's no frangrance to irritate you eyes.
it doesn't ball up on under makeup
also my concealer doesn't crease as much.
it's so light weight
does not leave a flaky residue because it does not absorb into my skin
i don't know if they are actually fading or the gel just creates a brightening effect
this gel doesn't migrate into the eyes like some creams do
not at all greasy
it doesn't have any effect on darkness or wrinkles
it doesn't wear well under concealer
i don't usually use eye creams/ gels because frankly they have never done anything noticeable
didn't burn or irritate my sensitive skin
they tend to feel too greasy
don't need anything with crazy anti-aging ingredients right now
my skin literally feels like it just had a facial ever time i use it
it's not on the cheap side
this is the only mask i have ever used that does not dry out my skin
it almost feels like you're wearing a sheet mask cause it's so cooling
you definitely need to use a brush to apply it
once you scoop some out it's like the consistency of honey
it does what it clam for.
not greasy or gross feeling
it is not a big deal- it's mostly cucumber-y
tingly sensation that continues even after you take it off
first of all when it hits your face it's the most soothing
it doesn't irritate my skin
the mask does everything it claims
except it's just thicker
because i really don't like masks that drip
i can't say about minimizing pores
i usually like them
my face is simply glowing.
it doesn't feel harsh or dry you out at all.
doesn't sit on top of my skin for too long
my skin looks so good i don't want to cover up the glow by wearing makeup
it's actually light on my skin
i do get all crazy trying to get rid of blackheads
it doesn't seem to work by bleaching
my skin looks even
i wouldn't recommend wearing this on its own because it will make you look greasy instead of glowy
you'll definitely see results
it's super easy to use
i like that you can use with sans water
it is so easy to take off my lipstick
did not take my matte lipstick as easily like this one
i only use it on my eyes since it's so expensive
no balms or makeup removers have ever gotten all of my eye makeup off
the last thing you want is waterproof eye makeup that is a pain to remove
i don't wear heavy makeup to begin with
left my skin feeling not greasy
it doesn't irritate mine it makes my skin feel so fresh
i didn't even need to use a wash cloth
this stuff removes makeup so well!
it doesn't leave a greasy feeling after cleansing
so much so that i don't feel the need to use oils or night cream
love this moisturizer because it doesn't clog my pores
if anything i would say it's next to odorless
i don't really need foundation just concealer.
it soaks in quickly so my face isn't sticky when i try to go to sleep
does not feel oily at all
find that water-based moisturizers aren't quite enough for my skin
my makeup couldn't hide it and i had a meltdown.
there is only one thing need to mention that it's a little bit too nutritive to absorb for me
fragrance in products usually don't bother me usually
it's not a huge jar
s--doesn't leave you "greasy"
doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy
i love how squeaky clean this face wash makes my face feel
make sure your face isn't dripping water when trying to rub this on otherwise it won't stick well
does not strip skin
guess it exfoliates too?
i continue to use it every day because it doesn't dry me out like other cleansing bars i have tried
doesn't leave me feeling greasy or oily
finally a soap that doesn't make my face itchy
it's foamy, but not soapy.
it doesn't always get all of my eye make up off
wasn't too crazy about the melting cleanser as i'm the kind of person that needs a cleanser to foam to feel like i'm really cleaning my face
otherwise it can make you look greasy
i would especially recommend this product to a friend that suffers from dry skin as a moisturizer only not a primer or to mix with foundation seeing because it makes you super oily
i never keep makeup with me besides lipstick
still want to add a swipe of mascara
you will still probably want to apply your usual moisturizer underneath
i wanted a more glowy primer/base for my makeup
not that i don't love my too faced hangover
the smell is a little iffy
it's far to greasy for my liking.
great after a shower/washing your face since it's a little thick to apply
this does have a slight shimmer so you can definitely wear it alone
it's not as thick as a bb cream however.
t didn't feel too heavy on my skin
touch ups while tube has liquid portion for when you're actually giving yourself or a client a makeover
didn't leave a tell-tale line at the jawline even though i don't blend the best
then just add concealer wherever i need it
you just need to dab it on
doesn't make me overly oily
it's more peachy than the online picture
not orange at all
i usually put a little extra on my cheekbones.
the cap highlighter is a little pointless though.
as it's hard to rub on without using a ton of it
let's just get this out of the way: the highlighter in the lid is useless
the highlighter in the cap is a little too dark for my skin tone
while i haven't used the highlighter as much as the cream itself
i do feel that if i wear the cream on its own it's a little to glowy
i don't use as much of the highlighter in the cap
it's a little too heavy for daily wear for me
doesn't leave me feeling sticky
i did not think it was hydrating enough for me to wear without another moisturizer underneath
the only reason i gave it a 4 was the fact that the flip top cap product was not very pigmented
it's a little too dewy on its own
it makes my skin look even
leaves no residue... does everything it says.
haven't had the courage to add it to my foundation since my skin is already oily
it was a little too shiny for my taste to put all over my face
even though i have oily skin i was still able to use it as a moisturizer
it didn't make my face oily either because it felt very light on my skin
not to mention the highlighter attached in the lid is beautiful too
most times i don't wear a lot of makeup
how ever it did leave me a bit oily
theres no excuse for not hydrating your skin.
unless you want really glowy skin!!
it may last longer if you don't have oily skin
i wouldn't say that it's very hydrating
if you are in hurry only this product with setting powder can make your face look bright
or alone to just look naturally glowing
on days that i'm not wearing lots of powder
i love that when you flip the cap there is targeted beam creme that i just glide on or sometimes use my finger to apply
i usually don't even use foundation
my only complaint is that it's a little much when it's really hot
adds a shine to the skin that doesn't look fake at all
which made me believe it works better for oily skin
it's definitely not a substitute for an moisturizer
i love that it doesn't have a "shine" to it like other liquid products
how to apply the flip-cap glitter either
if your face is looking dull
not in the slightest because i use only little bits
even though i am oily i still love to highlight.
i didn't want it to make me look too oily or greasy
it is not a highlighter
it isn't a highlighter either
i wasn't big on cream highlighters until i tried this
so the highlighter portion wasn't for me
it won't make you oily
it's hard to give products like these a try because you don't want to look oily
i don't find myself using the highlighter on the cap often because i find it difficult to apply
it doesn't wear off on clothing
there's a little goodie hidden in the cap
under your makeup or even over your makeup
it can be used as night time "makeup" since it's actually a face cream
i do find it irritates my eyes
you just have to be careful how much you use or you'll look like a disco ball
seems as though it would work for all skin tones
otherwise, it looks orange on me.
this has a lot of shimmer almost like a highlighting primer you can use over your whole face
i don't feel it's glittery at all
makes my make up routine so easy
if i could bathe in this product i would
if you prefer a matte look this is not for you or if you have oily skin i might avoid it
has a buildable sheen for those of you who do want to go crazy with it
you're literally wearing gold on your skin.
i don't like a lot of highlighters because they tend to be too bright
t might not be that great for people with oily skin
you can apply this all over your face if you want without worrying that you will look like the sun
i don't see any glitter
around my eyes because i tend to be acne prone
it doesn't go on heavy or greasy
it gives me an appearance of my skin almost not having pores
t having reviews of it not removing makeup didn't steer me away since i do use a micellar water to remove makeup before cleansing
you'd probably have to use a makeup remover first at night to remove stubborn makeup
this one doesn't make my skin feel tight or uncomfortable
i don't think this is strong enough to remove makeup
i don't feel that i am wearing eye cream
just do a skin test first incase of any redness
does not burn my eyes!
doesn't feel like i'm wearing eye cream.
there's nothing that will ever get rid of those except a good concealer
which i love for the orbital area of the eye because it won't cause milia
i don't feel like it's anything super special
it kind of leaves a slightly sticky feeling—not enough to really bother me
it's so rich that you only need to use small amounts -- it's been almost three months
a really intense acne medication that basically stops your oil gl
it's a ticker cream so to me i feel like that helps actually lock the hydration in instead of having it sit on top of my face
i would often struggle with getting shiny or even more oily after putting a moisturizer on
this doesn't happen with this rose cream
it's not over powering
this cream is one of the only products that doesn't leave my face oily
makes your skin look
so refreshing, not sticky.
this doesn't burn or break me out
doesn't break my skin out at all
i cannot rave enough about this moisturizer.
it's so weightless it's amazing
you won't displace the product on your skin or make a mess
some people complain about the smell
it doesn't feel super heavy
i apply a liberal amount because it feel a bit drying if you use a little
it find that it doesn't feel dry
it's going to be part of my skin care routine now
it's not at all overwhelming or chemical-ish
it doesn't make your face oily
though it's not a bad smell if you like roses it is very overwhelming
if i'm unable to find one i might just have to bare with the smell because it is a great moisturizer
this does wonders for my combination skin
it never gets oily through out the day
not greasy or heavy.
the scent is light and doesn't linger.
it doesn't make my skin oily
i wouldn't recommend this if you live in a place that's constantly warm
it's cooling on the skin
you just can't rub it in too much or it will ball up on your skin
i let it sink in and it works perfectly.
it's not super thick
not greasy at all
you can imagine yourself in rose garden.
it didn't make my skin feel greasy or leave a film
this was a bit too oily for my t-zone
you should apply this sparingly you dont need to put more than a few dots on the face as you pat it in your skin as it spreads easily
light enough for your day cream
bc i have such dry skin it's helped so much
once i put it on my face my skin absorbs it so fast it's so soothing
all in all it's a great product to try if you have dry skin
i don't believe its great for oily skin
don't wear any makeup
this is the only cream that suits me
a bit too much for me to wear under makeup during the day with my sunscreen
rich creams just don't get absorbed
to maintain the effects however i can't even skip one day of skin routine
not at all greasy
didn't make my face oily at all
doesn't get too greasy in greasy places
it does not leave any sticky or greasy feeling on the skin
plus the packaging is just so darn cute!
it doesn't feel greasy or heavy at all.
i just bought this cream but it's so bomb
i do not get super oily from it either.
it was not stinging or irritating to my eyes at all
the texture is hard to describe it's a smooth
i used it overnight nor do i mind thick night time skin care products
doesn't do anything for brightening or dark circles
i know it's pricey
don't have too many issues with my under eyes except for puffiness
did not crease my makeup
doesn't leave my skin looking shiny or feeling tacky
it also doesn't clog up my pores
it really sinks into your skin
sorta oily everywhere else on my face
let's moisturizer or makeup go on better
do not rub the gel into your face.
if you hate heavy moisturizers or are quite oily
i don't find it has a super sticky or tacky residue either
unfortunately there are few out there that don't have a load of irritating ingredients in them
bordering on shine if you have oily skin or put too much on
usually i am really shiny by the afternoon
now i can't moisturizer my oily/combo skin with anything else
if you're still iffy
it does leave my face sticky :-/
i will say that this is more for oily or normal skin
since using this gel i don't even need to use a primer all over my face anymore
become quite shiny in my t zone throughout the day
once it's absorbed it doesn't feel like i've put anything on my skin
i don't know that those with dry skin will like this because it doesn't really feel as though it's providing intense moisture like a cream would
it's perfect if you want something lightweight
never disturbs my makeup application
it does apply sticky
my pores get clogged with just about any cream i use
no stinging or irritation when it's applied.
this stuff is like a drink of water.
they had a tendency to feel sticky on my face
it feels like a cool drink of water when you apply it
for me was perfect because i can't use rich moisturizers
doesn't breaks me up
too rich for my skin if used 7 nights a week
absorbs quickly so no tacky feel
it is light to not feel sticky
i wouldn't recommend it on it's own for drier skin types as it's more serum-like
my makeup lasts all day
first off let me say if you have dry skin don't let the name fool you this is not a magical product that's going to get rid of that super harsh winter skin this would be something to add in to your skincare routine to help hydrate that bottom layer your regular heavy night creams can't
as someone who is oily combo i feel like my skin has oil on the top layer
i can't say that it has "brightened" my skin
it's not meant to be a moisturizer on its own
it can't really be used as a moisturizer unless you have truly oily skin
i actually hate this as a daytime moisturizer since i don't see any results
it's the perfect formula for oily skin types.
it's almost like my skin absorbs it all instantly
it hydrates but doesn't leave skin greasy.
it soaks in quickly and is never sticky or tacky.
my only issue is with the packaging: a lot of wasteful falderal
here's why:-works well with other skin care
doesn't leave tacky film-goes on just fine under eye- gives a good shot of hydration
when i put the b hydra on those areas it really helps them rehydrate
have the perfect combo for my morning skin without feeling greasy or heavy
plus, doesn't break my out.
i am never oily as the day goes on
my skin didn't break out or feel oily when i woke up
i wear it under makeup.
the hydration it delivers can't stay put on it's own
or even if you have oily/combination skin like i do during the winter
it doesn't leave behind that tacky residue that some gel moisturizers have
you dont need to depending on skin type
i think those w oily skin can get away with using just this
this also does not clog my pores.
also gotta love de's non-toxic skin care philosophy
this product doesn't leave me greasy: it leaves me balanced
doesn't leave my skin greasy
it actually sinks into your skin
it is also light enough to wear under makeup
there is a slight tacky feel once t's on
that tacky feeling isn't there
it's not scent free by any means
it's right there on my face
i don't notice that it makes me any more oily
it wears well under my foundation even on it's own though
while it's not the /most/ hydrating thing i've ever tried
doesn't leave residue on your face
it is not sticky nor does it leave my face feeling matte
my make up doesn't look crusty
no matter what other moisturized i've tried
it's caused break outs
the cream doesn't leave a greasy residue
really hydrates my combination skin without breaking me out or making me greasy
so... are we all smelling the same moisturizer???
doesn't feel thick at all with its gel formula
doesn't need look or feel oily
normal skin everywhere else so this moisturizer helps me wake up in the morning without feeling greasy
didn't clog my pores
without feeling glue-y as so many non-oil-based products can feel
it doesn't clog pores at all
no greasy feel leftover
it doesn't make my skin oily
this really let's your skin breath and relax.
i don't even use the other moisturizers at all anymore
sometimes it is a bit sticky
i don't use it in the morning/under makeup
personally i don't detect any overwhelming smell at all
not greasy in the slightest.
i can't stop touching my face because it just feels so soft
blue version of take a deep breath that i couldn't find on sephora anymore
once it's on your face
you can't smell it
you can smell it on your h
theres a lot of citrus ingredients which i don't mind at all
this product does have a smell to it
this moisturizer really does the trick
you can feel it foaming
my skin is on fire sometimes
this doesn't aggravate it
i actually use it in the shower.
i don't use it everyday though
didn't feel clean or revolutionary.
nothing seemed to suck those suckers outta there.
have yet to find a deep cleanser or mask that doesn't burn
rubbed like i normally do
i won't buy it again as i usually use the boscia black cleanser which is amazing
doesn't really foam up as much as kate somerville's exfolikate acne mask
my skin almost felt like i didn't need moisturizer afterwards
i usually take 2-3 good pumps
the foam is subtle so don't expect anything crazy
my skin is squeaky clean, but not not stripped.
it's a cleanse for your face
the only negative part is that it does make me a bit oily
it's almost like an eye mask.
the only thing to remember is that you still need to moisturize your eyes when using this
it's not hydrating in anyway.
i feel that you can use this over any concealer
i see or feel no residue
some people claim to see flakiness
that's because you've used too much product
sephora's roll-on gel is useless because it does not really depuff
most say this product is drying or leaves a weird film
it's not the product, it's about the application.
just for what even my hubby noticed this little sample did for my eyes
did not clog my pores
it's more like an essence
it's amazing for my morning routine
not only did this brighten up my acne scars
this is hard to apply like a lotion because of its watery consistency
is not heavy or sticky
you can't even feel it on your skin
seals in good moisture so my skin doesn't overproduce oil
this may be just perfect on it's own
would recommend this if you have dry skin or want to cut out a step in your skin care
for people not familiar with this product it's meant to be used in the place of toner
i feel that just soaks up the product which is such a waste
i can't tolerate anything perfumey because of migraines
i'll assume it's an essence?
i see a couple people saying it's too watery
apply it on your skin that way as i don't think this is meant to be a lotion
i usually use a belif moisturizer because it's light
it sort of goes on your face that way
trust it's a part on my routine forever !
it does not make my face oily
it's kind of in between the ginseng
it's not mattifying per say
not greasy even tho is not one of my favorite smell
it's a must have item!
doesn't leave any sticky residue
it seems like i am less oily
doesn't conflict with my oily skin at all
anyway i put this stuff on with damp h
if i thought the results were good using this some then i wonder what they will be like adding a serum or a anti aging moisturizer i'm 25
it's almost like i got a facial my face looks super tight after first use every time
honestly worth the price because everything i use usually makes me oily or dry
you don't feel oily at all after using it.
fields soothe which might i say is an awesome product
it tingles a little while i let it soak in
don't know if they are smaller or if the improved skintone hides them
don't get all the complaining about the scent bc it's very mild
bonus points because it's natural
rarely even a single zit
a nice break from the often cloying rose or otherwise 'feminine' smell of other products
not wanting to no longer have this new gorgeous skin
it's not a moisturizer so you still need to moisturize
which is amazing because usually when i wake up it just has a nice oil slick because my skin is usually oily
wanting to avoid your make up looking cakey by the end of the day
probably because i've never smelled saffron
i get absolutely no creasing from my makeup around my mouth anymore
although i don't have acne
the product does wonders for blemishes
they'd given us expensive creams with dangerous side effects that didn't actually work
it does feel a little sticky when you first apply it
yes it's a bit pricey but i fell in love with it.
i think it's light
i still get acne
my skin has a luminosity that it's never had before
sometimes a sacrifice for me
almost every product i try irritates my skin.
still get the occasional pimple
f you have dry skin this might not work for you
this does have a smell for about 20 seconds
once it's dried apply your moisturizer.
i can't imagine what it does for more mature skin
doesn't pull on the skin
it's not meant to be rubbed in your face.
at least it isn't some nasty fragrance that they put in after the fact
doesn't leave my skin sticky
should mention im a smoker which doesnt help my skin retain moisture
it's great to use under you eyes for bags or dark circles too
it's always nice to have an anti-aging serum in your routine especially one that brightens
the pimples were not red anymore
it leaves me feeling oily if i wear it under make up
i may have to stock up on this because it's so precious
thankfully, it's the total package.
it's also perfect to wear under makeup.
i now feel like i can wear full coverage foundation without it looking cakey
limited quantity(you snooze, you lose)
korres please turn this into a perfume!
is offended by the idea of oil cleansing
usually dislikes anything with the word 'brightening' loves this
which usually happens with acne products
the smell of the cleanser isn't bad
it's not a big deal since cleansers don't stay on your face for too long
i get cleanser squirting everywhere when i am not careful with my daily first pump
sometimes i feel lazy
i will say you get a lot of product for the money however the bottle is slippery in the shower when you try to pump
it doesn't do a lot to help my acne
it's often hard to press
i really like that i do not have to use toner after this
but... here's the catch.
when they say use sunscreen they mean it lol
in the long run it's a small inconvenience to unscrew
it does remove makeup
irritate your skin if you're not careful
it does take off my makeup
apply moisturizer right after as it does feel a tad bit drying on my face
i don't think it should be used as your makeup remover
i don't want to put that on the face wash
non soapy which i prefer
it makes my skin feel extreamly clean instead of feeling like there is a layer of soap still on my skin like some face washes do
it didn't give me the instant glow i was going for
there seems like a lot of this cleanser in the bottle
this is so good in removing my makeup even eye makeup
really cleans it with out irritating my combo skin
doesn't remove my makeup
it doesn't burn when you wash your face
you don't have to wait to apply your makeup
you're getting the pencil
i also use it on my clients when doing makeup if they're a little puffy under the eye
so that's a bit annoying
it certainly isn't a miracle eye cream
it's just a simple eye moisturizer.
it does it's job and sinks in well.
the mascara is good doesn't flake.
be careful once you twist up the liner you can't twist back
use it after a sheet mask, it's good recovery!
it's not unbearable/fake/heavy sented
it's just the natural ingredients that makes it smell that way
i know it's pretty expensive
it did wonders for the texture of my skin
the only con is that it's a bit pricy
makes my makeup slide everywhere
i hate moisturizers in general because everything feels too thick
this is one of the few moisturizers i can actually tolerate
some people don't like the scent of this cream
for a water cream i feel that this can be a little heavy for daytime use
it's a little light for winter use
it doesn't feel heavy or greasy.
the scars aren't gone or anything
i don't like the packaging though.
since this cream is water-based it doesn't cause my skin to get too oily
i can say that it truly does lighten hyperpigmentation
it's just the right amount of hydration
doesn't make my skin feel greasy at all
i would recommend this to anyone with combo oily like myself or even someone with oily skin just because of how light it is while being really moisturising
i really do think it's help with my mild rosacea issue on my cheeks by evening out the overall skin tone on my face
i get hormonal breakouts so my scars are very dark once they leave my face
i would lather it all over my skin if it came in a 1 lb tub-need i say more?
it's light and make my skin look plump.
like it feels so light because it's a water cream
just can't use on my temperamental cheeks unfortunately
not at all greasy
oily every where else
it doesn't make my skin any oiler
does not feel greasy or leave any residue
they don't actually feel like a drink of water for your skin
it's not too heavy for my normal skin
i find this cream gentle enough to use every night
sometimes skip it if it's one of those nights when i'm using a stronger aha
now if you have really really dry skin you may want to layer an oil under or over this cream
you can skip to timestamp 8:00 minutes or watch the full video for other glow-giving sephora faves
my skin literally thanks me for it gets much required hydration
since it's the single product that my entire skin care routine consists of i don't mind spending
i see a lot of people saying this caused more break outs or oily skin?
i will admit for the first 15 minutes of putting it on you may look a little shiny
it's going to do that a little until your skin absorbs it all
because it makes my makeup flake off
as a day cream it's more than good right underneath makeup
a primer might be the trick
i also need something that won't clog my pores
maybe they got a defective product because it smells like cucumbers not cigarettes
if you happen to notice some it's a sign that you need to exfoliate more
this stuff is magic in a bottle.
i know it's pricey
i tend to take notice
luckily it doesn't linger
normally couldn't use a moisturizer like this
i think it will be too heavy of a moisturizer for me in summer
doesn't make me feel oily
people complain about a smell
flaky no matter how much la mer i smoothed on
the texture is just everything you could expect from a watery cream
the smell is bad.2.
this doesn't happen if i use a heavy night cream
meaning it's not a heavy dense cream.
i wouldn't probably use it as my only source of moisture
the only thing that throws me off is the scent.
because i just couldn't take the constant breakouts
not greasy or heavy at all
gives your face a dewey look
giving it 4 stars because i feel it's a bit expensive
doesn't turn me red
this is not something i prefer to wear when i am wearing a full glam makeup look
doesn't feel clogged up like most moisturizers with spf usually do
its not sticky like some.
not at all overpowering
doesn't irritate my skin
doesn't leave me feeling gross or oily by the end of the day
does not leave my skin oily at all it leaves my skin with a glow like if i had makeup on which is awesome
it doesn't hurt my sensitive skin or emphasis any oiliness
i feel like i have baby soft skin compared to my mediocre 22 yo skin covered in peach fuzz haha doesn't really have a smell
because i don't wear make up
with that in mind i don't suffer from acne
i do get the occasional breakouts
also just those red spots that aren't acne
it's usually under control
while this product did not make all of my whiteheads
doesn't burn irritated areas
it also feels amazing on your skin- it isn't heavy or greasy
it dries quickly and doesn't leave an oily film.
didn't help with wrinkles at all
it doesn't have the same amour of salicylic acid that many other acne products contain
that also means it's not going to dry out those of us that are aging
it is so easy to overdo it
i over-did it a little bit immediately after i did a chemical peel
doesn't leave your face feeling too tight
not only am i avoiding reaction breakouts
it did not get rid of my acne completely
does not get rid of all the acne
t would be a good thing to add in your acne routine
any little thing that touches my face will disturb my skin
good for oily skin types because it's adding water
some days i feel extra oily
gross when it's hot
it doesn't feel heavy or turn oily
i couldn't believe that a simple moisturizer could work so well
feels so light yet somehow it's moistures the skin to an extreme
it's all up in my pores
once you get the hang of applying this moisturizer
doesn't cause breakouts or aggravate the ones i already have
the water-based formula makes it feel like it's going on like air
doesn't leave a greasy film
doesn't aggravate my sensitive skin or make me break out
i normally just do a hydragel or something after a shower
it doesn't feel heavy
when you start to rub it into your skin it really does feel like you're rubbing water on your skin
doesn't leave a shiny residue like a lot of moisturizers
it's like gel when you squeeze it out of the tube
it's the only thing that's throwing me off
otherwise it's a good product
doesn't feel heavy/greasy like other moisturizers tend to feel like
it does not leave a weird silicone feel either.
i am mix skin it doesn't feel too oil or too dry on my skin
or you'll need to use a lot of it.
it's good while it lasts!
also doesn't weight my skin down for so long
irritated skin from the elements here in alberta
not quite a gel or a cream
it doesn't leave a residue
didn't feel heavy at all
it does have a watery feel to it
i mean a little bit of jojoba oil first then i apply the moisturizer
also this stuff smells literally like froot loops
they either made me extra oily or dried me up even more
i agree with some other reviewers that it's not a miracle moisturizer for super dry skin
i like to use it as a primer before makeup because it does smooth out the skin
i don't know how it would work with oily skin
this stuff hydrates even that
there's no flakiness to my face when i use this
there's tons when i don't
i don't use masks or anything
you don't have to use much, and it glides on.
it's such a mission finding a good moisturizer when you have oily skin
it's cheap for a high end moisturizers
it's also nice to wear in the morning before applying makeup as it doesn't get oily or sticky on your skin
needless to say it's hard to find even moisturizers that don't irritate or break out my skin from being too heavy or having the wrong ingredients
it's just the amount of moisture i need
i layer this with my nighttime products or just during a no makeup day
that doesn't cause break outs while keeping my skin from looking dull
now he's hooked too
it's not irritating at all either like a cream.
it's gentle and doesn't make you feel oily.
i cannot use to heavy/thick of a moisturizer because it will just sit on my face
doesn't make my face more oily
true to it's name, feels like water.
i feel like if this isn't ample moisture for people
its honesty not gonna do much as a moisturizer for dry skin
love that it's so light weight
this doesn't give enough moisture on it's own
i'd say it's a great moisturizer for anybody who's kinda in the middle of the dry-oily spectrum
it's hydrating yet not one of those that'll leave your skin almost too dewy
low for a lightweight moisturizer that won't ruin my makeup
doesn't make my skin oily in the slightest
doesn't pill or feel greasy.
love the way this just melts into my skin like water
i find that the oil traps the moisture on my face alot longer
doesn't make my face feel sticky or oily.
it was great on my skin all day it didn't feel heavy or sticky
do not wear before makeup it does start to get clunky
feels super thick but drys to nothing i love it
it doesn't make my skin look greasy like the argan milk does
it goes on so lightly
i can't imagine not using a serum after having this one
it doesn't make me oily.
even out skin tone
i don't have that tightness in my skin anymore
i don't even believe in eye creams
for once i do not feel like i just trashed my money on useless or aggravating products
and you'll still need an eye product.
not this one i would even go to say that it completely blurred my acne it is pricy
it hardly has any color....id call it magic!
so my eye makeup doesn't transfer as much as it was when i was using a kiehl's cream
i didn't give it 5 stars because the ingredients aren't as natural as i'd like them to be
this did help with my puffy eyes though not my dark circles
just all over dullness
yet this treatment oil does not leave my face greasy
can wear it during the day too under my serums
i don't seem to need concealer anymore
the compliments just don't stop!
it does not make my face oily
it actually seeps into the skin when you use it
it's really helped even out my skin on my decollete
at first i was a little skeptical about putting an oil on my face because my skin can be naturally oily sometimes
i found that when i apply the sk-ii facial treatment oil it actually does not leave my skin feeling oily or overly greasy
it's really easy to use.
doesn't clog my pores even in my oily t-zone areas
or should i say, i used to have the blotchy spot!
anytime you add foundation over dry skin it's not a pretty picture
the only drawback is that there's no spf in this product
throughout the day i notice my skin does not seem to get as greasy or oily as using a regular lotion moisturizer
my skin does seem smoother
doesn't leave your facing feeling overly oily
one tiny drop goes a looong way
didn't make my face greasy
the bottle makes it so that you don't overuse it
doesn't leave it looking oily
i still occasionally get a zit
leave you looking like an oil slick
it does give you a glow that makes any additional makeup look good
it's almost like it's brought a bit of youth back to my skin
frankly hadn't even considered a facial oil
i worried that applying an oil to my face would make it greasy
i sometimes break out or my skin gets irritated
not under my makeup
the skii facial treatment oil was a bit of a mystery to me- what is it supposed to do?
it's not a "your face is covered in oil" teenager look
this product does not irritate my skin at all.
i guess that product is more for oily skin.
every so often or if skin in irritated from exfoliating it's a miracle worker
the thought of putting oil on my face wasn't exactly appealing to someone who used to have to blot her t-zone or use blotting powder
your skin just doesn't have that smooth
this product however was not messy or greasy.
didn't make my face feel greasy
i will continue to use it until it's gone because applying the oil is nicer than a serum
honestly when i received the sk-ii facial treatment oil in the mail i thought it was going to make my face look greasy
it was not greasy at all
it didn't feel greasy at all.
to the point that my skin will sometimes flake in certain areas
i only used this product at night after cleansing because it made my skin look a little oily
doesn't leave a greasy film or feeling on my skin
not enough to irritate my skin
nothing works to eliminate dryness like this does
i didn't give it 5 stars because i can only use it at night since i can't seem to rub it in long enough to make the oily look go away
when i wake up my skin is no longer oily looking
the product did not clog my pores or make me breakout
it comes in a glass bottle with a perfect dispenser for only getting out as much as you want
it didn't irritate my skin at all
it's easy to dispense just the right amount of product
the texture not too greasy
was afraid it would make my skin oilier
i like to keep things simple!
i oil is not greasy at all
it's great to use after a shower or even after washing my face or before applying makeup
once on i don't get the shiny look on my face
doesn't cause break-outs
as i'm not fond of putting oil on my combination skin
it does not leave me shiny or oily looking.
doesn't leave a greasy feeling on your skin
it doesn't leave any mess on my bed or pillow
yes your face is covered in oil
i knkw it is not acne clearing
air exposure is not a good thing when it comes to creams
while its oil it's not greasy
there's still parts of my face that are naturally oily
there's not an overwhelming scent
there's barely anything gone
it's a bit pricey for me
i actually have combination skin
my makeup goes on very well when i use this before applying bb cream
that is a shocker because he is a typical man who doesn't notice haircuts
not greasy at all
i only wish there was an spf in it because i dislike layering products on my face
i don't have to use powder or foundation anymore
don't think it is at all overpowering
doesn't make my face all oily
this stuff did not cause any breakouts or redness--
no scent and not too thick.
i could feel my skin suck up the moisture
it isn't sticky and it doesn't take much either.
but you get over the smell.
doesn't clog my pores
this product made legit 99% of my small acne go away
the smell isnt even that bad
would sometimes peel or roll off of my skin when i tried to apply foundation
you don't notice it after it's applied
i look "dewey" not greasy
not have to blot or powder every hour
if your skin could drink water
it's also expensive for a sleeping pack :(
i know some people use sleeping mask as night cream so maybe that's why it's not hydrating enough for them?
it does not feel sticky at all
i don't sleep much at night
this has been perfect for the florida summer months where i need a lightweight feeling moisturizer that's still powerful enough to replace what my skin loses from all the sweating
absorbs easily and does not make my skin oily.
my skin does not get irritated by the product either
once i applied it it doesn't smell
it doesn't leave you feeling sticky it smoothed out all the fine lines for sure
best of all, it didn't feel sticky or greasy.
good for lazy days when i just want to "wash
once you get a hang of the pump mechanism it's all good
anyone that thinks an eye cream is going to fix your eyelids in a few weeks has unrealistic expectations
you can actually feel it firm your lids.
i've also tried 10 different eyeshadow primers trying to figure out what's going on
my eyeshadow stays exactly where it should be
you'll save a ton on multiple eye lotions
i used this after getting sunburned really bad
i did add some extra lotion to keep the skin moist because i felt like it wasn't enough moisture
it does feel a little sticky at first
this stuff gave me instant relief and zero sting.
i've tried stuff from origins
it's amazing as well taking away the puffiness!
does not make concealer or foundation slide off under the eye
i do give it plenty of time to soak in
for me it is so convenient because it's in stick form
often times concealer couldn't even cover them up
what drives me crazy is that it doesn't glide on smoothly
tacky enough to pull on the delicate undereye skin if you just swipe it on
it helps so much in the morning when i need to get rid of my puffiness
definitely shouldn't replace your eye cream
it's light so that it doesn't feel heavy.
it's also perfect to take in your purse or with you on the go
i like how it's cooling
smooth when i apply though it's a little hard to glide
i don't really have puffy under eyes
non greasy eye primer i might add to the description
overall it works for me so anyone with oily puffy tired eyes will love this if you can spend the extra cash
everything around my eyes tends to sting it irritate-
not tacky at all.
i hate eye creams bc they are too thick
i usually do not like eye creams because they are too rich
not greasy or heavy at all
its a chap stick or lipstick style which is perfect except that its too 'fat' or wide
f you don't push the balm up enough you will scratch your skin which with the eye area is terrible
under eye products that don't have much of a scent
i can wear rich eye ceram in the morning
it did wonders for my puffy
it's different than an eye cream since it's a transparent balm
i can't live without their moisturizer
although i did detect a scent i'm not sure if it was an added scent or the natural smell of the ingredients
this doesn't sink into skin like a moisturizer would
guess that why they refer to it as a soothing fluid
doesn't look dewy or completely matte
oily skin types may find this to be enough on its own
this product is gentle enough to not cause any breakouts or leave me greasy upon waking up
i didn't get any redness or irritation
not sticky- not tacky- not heavy.
did not feel like it's clogging my pours overnight
it drys instantly so no need to really worry about it getting on sheets etc
not sure if it's too little sleep or dehydration or what
it's not sticky or tacky or heavy feeling at all
the only con i would say is that it does get sticky when you lay on your pillow even if you wait for it to dry
i can't stress enough how amazing my skin looks in the morning
it can get mildly sticky when you first put it on so give it a a little time to sink in before bed if you don't like that sticky feeling against your pillow
it smells amazing and it doesn't sit on my face.
in combination with the jelly mask my skin doesn't get that dry anymore
there is no texture and it's super easy to use.
acne prone these take care of it all without a single bother
it doesn't leave any form of residue except for a smooth feel
this one is my favorite since it's neither too watery or tacky
i will sometimes leave this on as a mask
that no matter how well i lathered up in the shower
unlike most charcoal products it doesn't leave a grey residue in my shower
and you can feel it cleaning out your pores.
usually soap doesn't really make a difference in my skin
my face because i get a lot of breakage there
and it doesn't smell bad.
where i sometimes get breakouts
feeling oily not to far into the day
the lather is nice too!
it's gentle enough to use on my face
my face does get little red breakouts
i teach hot yoga + practice often- this soap takes care of any break outs that i can get on my back area from sweaty sports bras
doesn't seem to be drying so far
i even use it to wash my face as i shower
not just to remove makeup
there is no need to rinse after using it.
even my skin tone
i love how it does it's job without stripping my skin of moisture
oily no matter what treatments i try
it doesn't seem to clear the dirt from my pores on my nose
a lot of the "gook" from your pores will emerge aka acne will likely popup
i would suggest you not have any light clothing or use light towels as the mask may stain some items
it's not crazy expensive.
you can literally see the oil
not enough to skip moisturizer
since it's so pricy i only use it 2-3 times a week
after 1 week of use it's smooth
not at all greasy
this doesn't pill off my face
doesn't have the terrible glycerin you find in some serums
it's like an all-in-one product that someone with normal to oily skin can probably use as their moisturizer
perfect for summer if you don't want too much grease on your face with some moisturizers
doesn't look too overdone
it's the goldilocks effect: just right.
it moisturizers just enough for me.
i don't even wear foundation over this often.
this gives you a finish that is not too shiny
it is lasting- also doesn't make my eye make up smear under my eyes
doesn't feel like it leaves a layer on your skin
t is not overly heavy i would say it is a light face lotion for hydration
the pink shimmer is too much to wear alone if i'm not putting makeup over top of it
exfoliate then use this, you'll love it
sometimes when i'm lazy i don't use night cream in several days
just wanted to blur imperfections
not chunky or anything
put it on with moisturizer before my foundation or even if i don't
it just didn't give me the glow i was hoping for under my makeup
this moisturizer isn't too heavy.
while its shimmery when you squirt it out it definitely doesn't translate to your skin that way
it's definitely going to be a staple with my makeup routine
the scent doesn't linger on the face.
usually i would never mask so frequently
i can get past the smell
i know it's pricey
the paste is so thick that a little goes a long way
it didn't make all my blemishes go away
it wasn't harsh on my skin
unfortunately for my wallet
this mask does have an
this mask did some wonders on my skin
if it's in your budget, try it!
with this product i did noticed less oily spots on my t zone of the face
it doesn't leave you greasy
i reach for this product every time i have sun damage on my face or a bad allergic reaction
it's not oil free
once you put it on it does not feel heavy nor does it leave a white screen on your skin like other sunscreens
this stuff doesn't clog pores or run
doesn't feel like it sits on my skin
i hate using primer because i've always felt it's pointless
since it's winter i still add a moisturizer on top
i think it might also help to control oil since i haven't been super shiny with using this
seems to act a teeny bit like a primer by smoothing my skin
it does not seem to clog pores
not heavy for oily/combo skin with a lot of good ingredients
its suppose to protect against harsh climates
when i rinsed it off i couldn't believe one application could do so much
the spray bottle tip so you don't waste any
you just want to have a slightly diluted version of it on your skin for 20 or 30 seconds away
therefore you can spray your face
you won't waste a drop
i wouldn't use it in the shower- definitely do the sink application
unless you have an acne spot
i don't feel like its burning my skin or anything crazy like that
it doesn't irritate it at all
don't love the fact that it's fragranced
couldn't wait to try the face cream
got this during the vib rouge sale since it's so pricy
not greasy oily or any film type of feeling.
or if it's just because of humidity
f you are super dry it might now be enough
i just wont use it before make up because of the greasy residue
if i don't apply this before my makeup
when i do use it as a primer
it always prolongs my make up
it's a little weird to work with
i would definitely recommend this sticky
this primer is so ridiculously sticky your makeup clings to it immediately
this primer does not make my skin feel oily or greasy
it's easy to apply, just follow the directions.
doesn't leave me a glowy look
it blends my fine lines too
you have to make sure to *pat* in upward motions on your face as this is a very tacky/sticky product
if you try to put this on your face as you would a normal lotion
you'll feel your skin tighten
mouth where it usually does
this is amazing if you have textured/pore-like skin or if you have that annoying laugh line creasing that baking just doesn't do enough
it's because this stuff somehow tightens
makeup stays on and does not budge!!
plus that tacky feeling actually helps when i apply my foundation
i don't like to use it as a primer
does not feel sticky or heavy on skin
i am not a primer fan usually
my makeup lasts all day
it doesn't ball up under makeup
it literally gets tacky on the skin
yes it is a bit sticky
it's so good but doesn't clog pores at all.
you won't feel awkward pulling this out of your cabinets if you're a grown woman
even better doesn't get flakey
it's a bit sticky , but it absorbs after a while.
it feels tacky when put on
you'll need less of it
keeps my foundation in place all day it's also super smoothing
i usually only have to oil blot once
because of the thick consistency yes it will take a while for your skin to absorb all that product
i can't still skip the moisturizer
and remember to tap it don't rub it.
this doesn't slide off.
it's definitely a little tacky
don't expect matte coverage.
something that isn't too slick
it's able to really fill in my pores to nothing without that silicone-y feeling
it's a bit tacky so let it dry before putting on foundation
i actually really like the jelly consistency
it goes on a little tacky at first
when you touch it with your fingers it just feels tacky
the tacky feeling isn't a big deal
when you pat it in the stickiness goes away
my tzone is not oily anymore
it's honestly more like the perfect moisturizer before applying foundation
it doesn't leave you too shiny or greasy like some moisturizers will do
i don't typically worry about products breaking me out
i don't know if i would recommend it for everyone with oily skin
it is a clear gel with a considerably sticky consistency that i suppose helps to grab the makeup
you might get shine from it
i think if you're oily your best bet is using a pump
i myself am ridiculously oily
otherwise it'll feel like you're trying to spread glue on your face
doesn't exacerbate oliy t-zone
tend to clog my pores i tried this as a novelty buy
i wasn't expecting the tacky feel on the skin at first
never look flaky with this primer
my makeup tends to wear off mid-day
it's a little difficult to apply to your face
my makeup looks completely photoshopped it is so smooth
the only downside is that it you nerd to put some effort into putting this on your skin due to its gel like consistency
my under-eye makeup doesn't look like makeup
there's no setting in the creases.
omg not only do my wrinkles look less deep
it's been difficult to get it to look smooth even with beauty blender until i got the j one jelly pack
yes that's right you want it to be sticky so that your foundation or bb or cc cream or moisturizer adheres well
it almost doesn't feel like a primer
i usually massage with my fingers unfil the texture becomes a little bit more watery
i still don't seem oily which is unheard of
i would often get pimples when i used other products
you need to let the product soak in
jelly pack did not disappoint
my face didn't feel slick or greasy.
your makeup just perfectly sticks on your face.
no matter what i do or use my make up always ends up looking cakey
all you need to do in the morning is wash your face
you can easily watch money go down the drain if you're not careful pouring it
so make sure to treat this splash mask like an actual face mask
i think i may transfer it to a spray bottle to make it less wasteful
it has completely gotten rid of my pesky adult acne
really lazy bumps to appear
i feel that the shower/splash/wash-off method is wasting product without getting the full effect--
it's a hard pill to swallow
side note: the packaging does suck.
beacause of the hefty pridce tag
make sure that you dilute it with enough water
regardless of how oily you are
i spray it on my face in the shower really well
the kind of hardened sebum that you cant even extract
even when i do get a breakout its not an angry painful pimple
i don't think its a fair comparison being that this is a mask not a toner
if you're not on meds
if you don't want to spend the money on expensive chemical peels
get this if you have acne!
it does sting a bit but it's bearable.
it is not a typical serum in that it is not as watery
it melts very easily when you rub it between your fingers
my skin is kind of tricky in that my t-zone is semi-oily
it's easier to use the spactula that to take some out of the jar
sometimes i use it in place of a moisturizer
fresh after cleansing- the only think i would say is that it is very liquidy
it doesn't smell awful
i'll hit the downside to this product first: it's really pricey for its size
almost like you get when you eat a mint
i did notice some breakouts today so maybe it's from the mask unclogging my pores
not at all uncomfortable unlike some of my other detox masks
my face does not feel stripped or lacking moisture
doesn't feel stripped of moisture like other clay masks
this mask doesn't help that
this one does not make your skin feel stripped after
i can't really speak to its effects on acne
although it didn't cause any irradiation it which is very common for me it left me with a patch of acne where i had applied it
i also love that its a mask that wont dry out
it definitely doesn't have the super clean effect of the glamglow supermud
it doesn't cause breakouts or anything
sometimes get little pimples
i swear i am not oily at the least
they keep me from getting too oily
they do make a huge difference for supper oily t-zone people like myself
it also makes me look less oily
not greasy at all
i do not have that oily of skin
even if i'm not wearing much makeup i don't get oily at all throughout the day
doesn't work into my clinique mattifying foundation as well
now, i'm not crazy oily.
must have if you get a tad oily.
you gotta blend this in with a primer.
nothing keeps me matte like this does
blotting in my t-zone during the day with a beauty blender to see how that does
the primer can't stop my skin
it doesn't get rid of all my oil to the point i no longer have to blot
not even lancôme 24hr can totally hold all day without getting shiny on my skin
the makeup breakup that is bound to happen
i despise that feeling of your makeup sliding off your face
i hate how my pores look huge bc i get so oily on my nose
it won't disturb your makeup"
i didn't have to blot or powder at all
couldn't wear due to the greasy formula
i do notlook like an oil slick
i didn't even realize that i had an issue with discoloration on my skin until i used this product
t zone wasn't shiny the skin around my eyes were full
as it does not leave your skin feeling tight like most serums
it's not oily at all
yes, it's expensive, but it's a serum after all!
t doesn't feel like i have product on my skin before makeup
i just wish it had a little bit of that smoothing silicone in it to blur everything
it's not too much moisture where it makes the white bumps
the spout is a little picky though.
yes, it's a bit pricey!
i don't have many or deep lines
i will sometimes get milia on
plus it's air tight
i do use this at nighttime too
you could makeup swap out for a thicker night time eye cream occasionally at night if needed
i guess it doesn't provide sun screen.
it's the perfect everyday moisturizer that doesn't make the skin extra oily or dry
a quick fix for all that ails me.
i know it's pricey
not feel greasy or heavy is beyond me
so the jar lasts awhile
because it is a cream you would think it would feel heavy on your face or leave it oily
doesn't feel too heavy
for those hot summer afternoons when you still wanna wear a bit of make up
it's oil free yet hydrating enough for my combo skin
yet it's not heavy
it's really important for me to use a moisturizer that doesn't feel heavy
doesn't clog my pores
weird that it's being advertised as oil-free when shea
this is a must if you have oily skin like me.
i don't like to feel oily !
i would expect such a thick moisturizer to do that normally
i even decant this for travel as i can't be without it
they take all the bad for you chemicals out.
price is high for a cream but hey it works
doesn't irritate my skin or make it feel sticky unlike most moisturizers i've tried
it's so easy to put on if you're in a rush
it doesn't just disappear on the skin once it sinks in like a lot of other moisturizers do on my dehydrated skin
does not feel tight or too oily either
i can finally wear matte makeup!
it doesn't contain ingredients which create a pseudo-smooth "slip" to suggest softness
doesn't put unnecessary ingredients in their products
i literally can't be without this moisturizer.
it also doesn't ball up
it's what my face needs without all the additives other br
with this there's been a decrease in the amount of flaky patches on my face
my oily parts haven't gotten worse either!
it's not greasy at all
what i also like about this moisturizer is that it doesn't have all these 100 + promising ingredients
only irritate my skin
reminds me of lamer only for the texture
s light enough not to go overboard when my skin is oily
it doesn't clog pores either.
it doesn't feel heavy or drying
i try to keep my skin care simple
the results i get i don't think it's as expensive as other creams that don't do anything for your skin
not irritating on the skin
find that it isn't too greasy or thick
i noticed i don't get greasy throughout the day when i wear this
i actually like this cream i have combination skin
this cream just gives my face the moisture it's needed
doesn't leave my skin feeling oily
it is not heavy at all nor greasy on your skin!
it's so easy to apply unto my skin
and it doesn't make my face feel oily or dry.
it doesn't make my skin more oily
not heavy or greasy
i don't seem to be blotting quite as much as i do even when i use a mattifying or oil-control moisturizer
my face gets really bad dry patches so putting on makeup would be a mission cause it'd look flakey
it doesn't feel greasy at all.
although it looks plain
hasn't made my acne freak out
it sunk in immediately and didn't leave me oily.
this moisturizer doesn't leave your face oil
without really being heavy or greasy
that i don't need to stick my fingers
love the fact it doesn't irritate my skin
you'd never know i struggled for so long with super dry skin
i think it's thicker than everything else i've used
due to its thickness it's pretty hard to spread out on the skin that's why i took a star off
if you use it with any other moisturizer it can clog your pores
it's not too greasy that my makeup won't adhere either
i like that its not greasy
plus it didn't irritate my skin or cause any breakouts
this cream also doesn't feel greasy at all on me
you don't need a lot of this cream.
doesn't leave skin greasy
is not too greasy
it was a little tacky at first
not the slightest bit greasy
doesn't leave your face feeling heavy like some face creams can
it's rich without being greasy.
you don't need a ton, just a little dab will do.
doesn't make my face feel greasy
it's thicker than i'm used to
anyway this moisturizer doesn't make me break out
it is not as if my skin has changed it's structure or elasticity
no matter what when i would put eyeshadow on
it would look horrible bc of how dry my eyelids are it would look very flakey
i do a couple layers of this
this stuff does not irritate or make my skin break out
see how it wears under foundation with my combo skin
jar packaging because products tend to get under my long nails
that it's more sanitary while dispensing just the right amount
t doesn't feel heavy when you put it on
doesn't make my skin oily or breakout
my t zone shows a little bit oily when i use it overnight
the design of the container is great because the cream isn't exposed to either the elements or any bacteria on your fingers
do not be weary if you have oily or acne prone skin
it did not make me oily
it's a pretty expensive product, but i love it!
never feels greasy or heavy
tempted to use it everyday
this stuff made my skin look glowy
as a moisturizer on mornings when i haven't had enough sleep
if you apply too much it makes you really shiny
i'd by this stuff by the boatload
it's not a greasy moisturizer or glotion which can clog pores
t's not like you will have a glitter bomb on your face
i don't need to use a primer for my face makeup
that stuff was useless for me
the fact that my skin is still not even remotely oily is a big deal
i actually use this more as a cleanser right now because it's hot
i will say that i have very oily skin with occasional monthly blemishes
not wear heavy foundation or nothing at all
i've never used it alone because i have moisturizers targeted toward oily skin that work really well for me
it made my face actually a bit too shiny
this stuff doesn't do much to hydrate
not in a sparkler in your face kind of way
i dont feel like it makes me greasy or oily feeling/looking
was convinced that i would hate it for my combo/oily skin
a great moisturizer that isn't greasy yet somehow
love if for no makeup days so my face doesnt look dull
my skin looks like just plain flawless skin
i break out easy, i don't blame the lotion.
didn't have to mix it with my liquid stuff
most importantly it doesn't feel oily at all it's a thicker formula
do not use if you have oily skin!!!
it does not make me oily throughout the day
those just weren't hydrating enough for this type of use
two dabs is all you need basically.
it doesn't look flattering on acne or dry spots
i also can't stand the scent.
it does make your skin look brighter
it's perfect for days when i don't want heavy makeup
sometimes in lieu of a bb cream entirely
wasn't on the whole dewy look train
although it doesn't have pigmentation
i don't use primer all the time
when i do it's hourglass veil
just enough that on oily summer days i can forego a layer under the sunblock mix
i wear it all over my face for a no makeup-makeup look
i can't imagine using this alone as a moisturizer
in the mornings, under makeup, yes please!
i wear it over my foundation or on it's own.
i look like i'm glowing, not sweaty or gross.
it's really easy to use to, you can't mess it up.
it doesn't leave a tone on your skin
i wouldn't recommend wearing it under a medium or full coverage foundation as i think it could look a little too thick or cakey
have no idea what it's like layered
sometimes i find it can ball veeerrry slightly in combination with my concealer
the shade though wasn't enough tone for me.
not a pump like the becca primer
it smells like bubble gum so that doesn't suck
i wouldn't mind smelling it all day because it reminds me of summer
i don't see it illuminating because it's too sheer
its honestly become a staple in my everyday beauty routine
its great layered under makeup or just worn alone
it's not a big deal for me to apply my regular moisturizer underneath this
it's nice that this isn't heavy or greasy
as i think that it makes my skins look too shiny
i don't see it's blurring effects
i like that this doesn't make my skin look too shiny or oily
primers are just too "glowy" for me
f you are light skinned it's going to change your color significantly
this product lets me skip foundation altogether.
it did keep me matte for a while
i noticed i wasn't nearly as oily as usual
clearly doesn't cause me to be extra oily
it sort of reminds me of the smell of hay
i always have to make sure the product doesn't have ingredients which will clog my pores
i don't feel the need to put on a moisturizer after either of these oils
it's not too heavy
this doesn't breaks me out
i think it's helping with my acne scars
it's not greasy or heavy.
it doesn't make my face oily
does not leave an "oily" feeling
i just don't like the scent at all
scents in products never bother me
sometimes i even forget i put it on
it's almost like i have normal skin now.
completely get why they used fragrance so mask it
i don't even need a daily moisturizer anymore before putting on foundation
it isn't greasy at all
those aren't all pure oils
it doesn't irritate my skin
smooth that it's ridiculous
can't rave enough about this facewash
!does wonders for my skin.
doesn't sting my eyes when removing eye makeup
i love the feeling of taking off my makeup with a gel rather than some sort of cream or oily liquid
doesn't cause any breakouts
holy cow i feel so clean after i use this
decided to use it as a mask rather than a cleanser
when it dries you can see all your pores because the mask is slightly darker from the oil it has sucked up
i love that i can literally see how it is purifying my pores
i can feel my skin breathe once i scrub my face with this stuff
it's such a nice thing to wash your face with!
doesn't feel like it takes forever to rinse it off
i feel like i don't have to use peels or exfoliating products anymore
if you don't love your current cleanser
sometimes i need a little extra scrub
i didn't find this overly drying, either.
it's slightly scary to see it on the shower wall at first
so you can use it everyday without worrying about dryness
just beware because it's really black
i do like the "squeaky" clean feeling this has
best of all my acne prone skin doesn't have any new acne after using this for a week to my disbelief
this did not make my face oily
will recommend to everyone with oily skin or even combo skin
am really not supposed to use exfoliates because they irritate my skin
it is not gentle enough for me to use every day
this is great way to get rid of the muck that soap
lately my skin isn't smooth enough for my foundation application
this does not make my skin tight
others have suggested it's abrasive
i would suggest your skin is desensitized
i'd hate to see it on normal skin
just not a fan of the scent.
it's not super abrasive like some of the exfoliaters out there
it's so fresh, gentle, and it gets the job done.
i don't smell anything
allergy tested products anyway -- so that's fine with me
it doesn't foam up
would steer away if you prefer foamy cleansers
the packaging is even pretty good because once it's almost empty
was a little spectacle because i hate changing my face routine
it does not add to my oilyness that usually creeps in an hour after i wash my face
works amazingly and doesn't break me out!
i feel like it really scrubs off those dead skin cells
i usually can't use clinique scrubs because they're too harsh
you do have to work it a little to get a nice lather
even out my texture
it's gentle enough to use every day
it's not harsh or rough at all
i think it's even helping with my dehydration problems
just be careful don't let the scrub get into your eyes
it really does correct skin imperfections
it does looks like it's thick
i don't have too many skin imperfections
the things i dont like: it kind of smells like elmers glue
you cannot touch/rub your face or the excess balls up into little flakes
you've got yourself a medium coverage
set it with powder and you're on your way.
doesn't feel tight on the skin
anymore or less based on skin type effects the results
it doesn't sting my face at all
it's not good for oil control
it doesn't prevent my face from looking shiny as the day goes on
this doesn't feel heavy on my oily t zone
this doesn't leave my face feeling greasy
yet it controlled my oily t-zone to an extent
i don't regularly wear makeup
don't know how well it works as a primer or under makeup
better as a primer because it doesn't make my face feel cakey with my foundation
i don't especially care for the matte finish
i don't wear foundation because it immediately makes me look scaly
just moisturize the heck out of my face
this stuff has a nice non-oily texture that absorbs quickly
my skin is so dull in my opinion.
hated how shiny it made me look with using this product my skin stays matte
use it every morning as my makeup primer
love it as a primer for makeup
let me start by saying i have oily skin
my makeup lasts longer without getting shiny
this product does not make me oily like porefessional did
don't do anything for my large pores
took one star off because it claims to be a moisturizer when it's not
i do need to use a pore filler on my cheeks to really blur everything out if i want a more flawless completion
this says it's good for oily/combination skin
this product is great to use right out of the shower when you want to hydrate your skin before it becomes flakey
you can 100% see a difference in my skin when i'm not wearing makeup
its so hard finding a moisturizer that actually penetrates those pesky chin
does the job without being oily or making my pores worse
f you have super dry skin you would probably still need a moisturizer underneath
doesn't leave any sort of residue
it's got a lot of fillers in it which is normal for a formula like this
it doesn't feel like silicone at all to me
doesn't have that silicone feel which i hate
love wearing this too on days i'm not wearing makeup
it's does blur your imperfections
it almost feels like it would be oily
it's to the point that the person who does my facial cringes every time she exfoliates it for me
it's definitely not a solution for oiliness
i usually only use a bit of concealer under my eyes
it blurs my imperfection enough to skip foundation
doesn't leave my t zone looking too oily like many moisturizers do
i usually use the ole hendrickson sheer transformation moisturizer which helped initially improve my texture
doesn't leave my face oily
i wouldn't say it leaves it matte either
it's not greasy and works great for my oily skin.
you don't need much just a thin layer
i noticed that my skin didn't look as oily in my t zone through out my
when my face is matt then my makeup does not slide off
t doesn't spread quite as easily as other products
doesn't make me look or feel greasy
it doesn't blur any of my pores
it doesn't pill, and it absorbs really quickly.
after trying so many eye creams for daytime wears
addicting smell that i can't get enough of.
this cream does it all!
it does not irritate my rosacea at all
i see people complaining about the scent
it's also nice as an overnight moisturizer.
i evene tend to get irritation
kinda tried it on a whim.
it's by no means matte
does leave you very shiny
this is the only moisturizer that seemed to help it all
if i dont use oil or moisturizer it can even get flaky
it's a bonus as a primer too
as i feel that it's too heavy to wear under foundation
would not recommend for oily skin though
the smell is not bad
don't like anything too heavy in the summer
but no need to do than with my egg mellow cream.
surprisingly does not feel goopy or heavy
not quite sticky-ness
not with this cream
can't say if it really takes care of wrinkles or firms the skin
not greasy or too heavy- just right.
it's a little on the pricey side for moisturizers
it's also light enough as an eye cream
didn't leave my skin feel tacky
it did leave a certain light tackiness after application
smooth's your skin without making it feel heavy
usually can't really use moisturizer
i can't recommend this moisturizer enough
i usually breakout from any moisturizer i try
i see others don't like the "fragrance"
i don't smell anything
it does not linger on my skin
as for the smell i don't use a lot of it
does not become greasy like other creams i have tried in the past
tend to get a little oily
product is not gouging your wallet
also it's an eye cream as well.
can't wait to try it as a make up primer.
really does seem to plump the skin
it's a bit sticky on my face
is not oily or sticky, you'll love this cream.
it's perfect to layer under spf makeup during the day
so for lazy nights when you don't want to go through you're whole routine you can just slap this on
i don't find it to be overpowering or masculine at all
the first night i used it i didn't care for the sticky texture
i usually don't buy any moisturizer that is fragranced because for some reason i'm just imagining it clogging my pores
doesn't feel heavy under my foundation
i rarely wear night cream
usually moisturizers will make me break out
doesn't leave it greasy
makeup or simply go to sleep
i normally can't even use oil-free moisturizer since my skin is so oily
this product is light enough that it soaks in without leaving that shiny layer
i don't wear much makeup - but i love buying it!
the first time i try out this product i totally mess it up because i wasn't used to the kind of brushy format it has
this is the perfect moisturizer for those days where your skin is looking "blah"
if your norm/oily like me it will be your holy grail illuminator
does not cause my makeup to slide around yet still provides enough hydration underneath to withst
will wear it under my makeup
so at the very least it's not causing any pimples
i don't experience any sticky
i didn't bother to even care about foundation until my skin was less textured
not heavy or greasy
doesn't burn or itch
every time i use the combo my makeup wears nicer
would probably not suit oily skin
i know this says it's for oily skin
i mean i have used oils
no only does it not make me more oily
it helps hydrate my skin enough where it doesn't feel the need to produce excessive oils
it wasn't an instant fix
i don't usually rave over skin care or makeup products because nothing i've tried has controlled my oily skin
it gave me a glow that doesn't make me look greasy
then on my t-zone i apply a little bit of the makeup forever smoothing primer over top
the only downside i have is it is quite tacky for several minutes until it dries fully which can be a bit annoying when doing my makeup
does not make me greasy
i know that sounds so gimmicky
can't believe it's not raved more by beauty gurus or makeup artists that i watch
i couldn't be happier with the lightweight consistency that doesn't clog my pores
this moisturizer feels just like water when you pump it out
a lot of people complaining about it leaving your face feel sticky
it's not sticky at all
just because it's more light weight
i hope it's not too drying when the winter comes
non-greasy that my skin is so happy whenever i use this gel on it
tho it is not as subtle
it's okay for it to feel a bit sticky at first.
it does mattify my skin
if you are someone with large pores you need this in your life
it's not sticky st all for me
the gold sparkles don't really show up on your skin in my opinion
i do notice that it is a little sticky before it completely dries
if you used too many pumps "off course" it's going to be too sticky
don't expect a matte finish
i didn't mind because i felt like that was just the consistency of the formula to seal in moisture
pore minimization i'd say it does a nice job
which makes your complexion on point
it's keeps my oil at bay
it's great for people who aren't prone to breaking out
does not leave my skin sticky either.
isn't too heavy for my oily t-zone
the gold like shimmer particles it has in it does not leave any color on your face once applied
it just leaves your face looking glowy
there is a "sticky" kind of feel to your face once applied
apply this- sometimes no primer
it's too rich for the day for me
maybe because i have brown skin
it does leave a tacky feel if you use too much
however i feel as if the tackiness grabs my foundation
my pores doesn't feel "gunked" up
my only complaint is that it does have a slight tackiness if you apply too much
it's the only gel i've used that delivers the perfect amount of moisture without looking too greasy
nobody wants melting face
decided not to blot because the combination of sweat
i think it's the gold that's in it that makes my face seem like a greasy disco ball
gives me just enough moisture
it's like water on the skin
this cleanser doesn't use those useless micro beads like most exfoliators do
you can actually feel it deep cleaning your skin.
take it with me when i go on trips it removes the dry skin when i feel like my skin needs a little extra tlc
trying cleansers/masks because of what they do to my skin
it's very clean compared to putting something messy on your h
you rub it on your face then use your h
it definitely does a good job of gently removing any dead skin
doesn't leave it feeling dry like i just used cheap toner on it
tarte actually has a mean skin care line
this stick is so easy to use
it feels harsh when it's going on
i also love that it's colored because i feel like it's easier for me to tell when i need to keep rinsing to remove all the cleanser product
i didn't have that problem of the product melting at all
doesn't irritate my skin at all
don't irritate my skin
it's easy to travel with
skin care irritates my skin this doesn't.
this exfoliator does a perfect job of taking off the dead skin without harming anything else
although it doesn't smell amazing
it's helped my complexion a lot
it's not too rough
it certainly doesn't irritates the skin.
it's not too harsh
this stick is so easy to use
the microexfoliants don't feel harsh against my skin
my blemishes weren't irritated either.
doesn't smell weird and will travel well.
it's not too harsh
it's the right consistency
it's a little rough on the skin
you can use it as a mask
it's a bit expensive for a stick
it might be gimmicky
it's a very fine grit
doesn't irritate my skin too much
if you travel it's so easy to travel with
i must say although it's tiny i used to
it's so simple to use
it's like a glue stick it's easy to put on
it's perfect for travel and it's so easy to use.
the grit is perfect--not too abrasive
it's not even gritty enough to scrub at all
it's the perfect consistency for me to feel like i'm actually rubbing the dry flaky skin off my face
usually they either dry out my face or don't clean me enough
maybe if you keep swishing the stick around your face you'll only get a few uses out of it
i love that it's super easy to use
the exfoliating scrubbies are small enough that it doesn't feel like you are scratching your face
it's basically a face mask stick and i love it!
it doesn't have any weird smells to it
my face feels like a baby's bum
i love it, exfoliates, but doesn't sting or hurt.
i never thought of tarte as a company that made face wash however this is a game changer
i can really tell that my face is less oily after just one use
can use this in my everyday routine to help get all the dirt grime
you know it's good when someone who is weary of a br
that it seems bad germ wise to just rub it all over your face that is wet
doesn't strip your face
only downside is that it won't remove eye makeup.
doesn't have a scent to it at all
the formula itself doesn’t seem to have a scent
if i had to give it one i would say it mostly smells like glycerin
it doesn't really lather much.
what i love about this product is that it's gentle enough to use a few times a week
so convenient and easy to use.. no messes :):)
i don't think i will be using this product just for the fact it's not shower/no mirror friendly
it's not too rough or abrasive
doesn't irritate my skin
i think this is was great product because it can either be a mask or a facial cleaner
it doesn't seem to strip too much oil off your skin
just enough to cleanse it
let's not forget acne prone
doesn't leave my skin raw
there doesn't seem to be much product for the size of the container
as you rub in the product with your h
i love that you can use it for a scrub or leave it on
most days when i don't use makeup i still use this after my foam face wash
it's easy to apply and quick to wash off.
it's quick easy to use
so you don't feel like you're scrubbing your face with walnut shells
down side 1- i feel that if you get it wet the stick gets "smushy" for lack of a better term
this stuff is black
it's best to put it on dry skin- the product is soft so you don't need to press too hard
this mask is everything.
yes the alcohol smell is intense at the beginning
whenever my skin looks dull
the trick is to apply enough layers for you to be able to peel it after the product has dried
i usually let it sit for 45mins.
you can just rinse off what you can't peel.
which is expected because it's a peel
it doesn't last long once it's on your face
you really do want to put a thin layer on your face because it's almost like having your face waxed
once you peel the mask off omg your skin is so soft
the odor only bothers my while i apply it
i didn't realize until after i used it that you have to put a thick even layer on
why reviewers are saying that this mask is hard to peel off
yes you have to put a certain amount over your face to get the proper treatment however peeling this mask off is simple
any thing that's left over you can simply wipe away with a wet cloth
it's just that simple.
i used just a little on my tzone where i most oily
what it did do was made my pores tiny
if i use this mask
moisturizer it's like i have a new face
i really like this peel off mask.
not it doesn't take off as many white/black heads as i would of liked
sometimes i give up
sometimes it makes my skin feel oily the next day
it hurts to peel off sometimes
it does kind of hurt peeling it off
do not put this mask around your eyes
don't let it dry too much or it won't peel well
if you don't apply to eyes
when using you'll have to apply the product a little thicker than normal masks as it dries the peeling effect is easier if its thicker
be careful if your washing your face in the sink the peeled off pieces wont melt too quickly
or maybe i just need to put a thicker layer on
the smell does quickly dissipate leaving behind this orange mask that's so much fun to peel
makes me cough a ton
actually made me cough because of it
like as if you put lemon juice in your eye
it doesn't smell that strong
no way is the scent that bad.
anyway you have to let it dry fully in all areas of application for it to peel off neatly
it skins into my skin rather than sitting on the surface like many other moisturizers out there
my only gripe is that it's not quite hydrating enough for the winter
version in case it's too heavy
it smells like all other face creams to me.
i don't wear a lot of makeup
this origin moisturizer is very good in all day it doesn't give my skin very oily
isn't bothering my reactive skin
i find my skin is not as oily at the end of the day as well
this product does not cause my makeup to bleed
it's lightweight and not greasy.
for some reason it is making my skin feel a bit greasy/oily
perhaps a bit too oily for combination skin
it gives my skin just enough moisture without making it greasy
there's no way for them to come out unless you cut into the bottle
it's good at removing makeup too
the combo of lazy+sensitive doesn't lend itself to actually washing my face
doesn't burn or make me red
can't speak to its use as a makeup remover
foams just don't work
it feels so soothing when it's applied
so many other acne treatments don't actually kill p
i find it irritates my skin
sometimes i have to use 3
i like to see that a product is really showing you every piece of dirt on your face whether it's before or after you've cleansed your face
it's the first one i've used that doesn't sting my sensitive skin
i love to use this is the morning when i'm too lazy to use a cleanser since you don't have to rinse it off
i can definitely say it's help to soothe
my skin looks super clean- pores aren't nearly as noticeable because they're cleaned out
i'd have to say it's because real green tea leaves are contained in the bottle
to the point i can't even put my face in ocean water
as long as you are following up with a toner or something that will completely get the cleanser off of your face i think you shouldn't have any problems
it is probably better suited for oily or acne-prone skin types
i can say this really helped me with all the oiliness in my t-zone :
not least the infused tea leaves look so neat in the bottle
plus a little goes a long way since it's a foaming pump
this is the only cleanser that does not leave my skin feeling tight after use
it's so so gentle
my skin never looks irritated when i use this
my skin is usually really red
doesn't strip or dry it either.
does not do too well ridding makeup
i don't mind because it's gentle
now i find i can tell a difference in the texture/softness of my skin when i don't use this
is still gentle enough that it doesn't dry me out
i don't mind the smell.
well let me tell you i use this with clarosonic brush
i don't feel super dry or stripped when i use it
this seems to remove all the makeup
i don't use it that often
it's gentle enough for my acne prone skin
still gets all the nasty stuff off of it leaving it soft clean
i like that this cleanser doesn't make my skin red
i only need one pump or less to wash my whole face
i don't have much redness
it doesn't remove all the dirt from my face
i probably just have pesky blackheads
the foam is thick that you only need a little bit of the product
i love it because it won't dry out my skin like other cleansers tend to do
i dont wear too much makeup except for a lot of mascara
you wont have any residues left
with this product you dont need any toners pr makeup towels this removes it completely
i like to use it in the morning because it's so refreshing
i think it's perfect for those with oily
it doesn't strip my skin
since it's a foam pump
i can't put it in a different container
this cleanser doesn't only give me both of those
my skin doesn't feel tight like with most foam cleansers
it doesn't break the bank
so you can use this to remove makeup
the reason why i give this 4/5 stars is because this bleached my skin
it's pretty cool that the product has literal tea leaves in the bottle
it's not like any other foam cleanser i have tried before
this is one of those change your life kind of cleansers
the fact that it doesn't irritate my skin makes it worthwhile
this cleanser not only makes my skin feel squeaky clean
don't get it in your eyes, because it will sting!
your skin can go through a bad phase where its bringing all the bad stuff to the surface
doesn't break my out
it actually even helps with my acne
i always use it before i apply my makeup as it tightens my pores
you know those mud masks that make your skin so tight?
it's a beautiful mask that didn't irritate my skin
it isn't a miracle worker when you need that extra pore cleaning
i'll probably stick to origins charcoal mask when i need that deep cleaning job done
it's a nice treat to pamper yourself for sure!
at least not mud masks
does not irritate my skin at all
not sure how anyone can possibly claim that a mud mask is "hydrating"
washing the mask off is easy, too.
i love that it is easy to clean off
doesn't irritate or crack skin
it doesn't have a tight
uncomfortable feel when on your skin like a lot of mud masks
i can't speak of any renewed elasticity
this is a great mask for normal to oily skin types bc it doesn't overly dry out your skin
it's not off-putting, but not the most pleasant.
it makes it difficult to try new skincare products because it can become worse if my skin hates it
it's like angering a beast
you can literally watch this mask suck the oils out of your skin
the grit is so gentle it doesn't irritate my face
the product itself smelled good not like a chemical kind of smell
this mask is quick and not super messy.
it's definitely become a part of my daily routine
it's even great for my pre-teen daughter's face!
does not irritate my skin at all
it's gentle enough to use every other day
this isn't some sort of holy grail product for me
it doesn't irritate my skin!
it may not provide enough moisture
it's great for oily skin
i soon realized like most products it's a scam when there's any oil in a product it will enlarge your pores
makes double your natural oil plus yours putting oil infused product on your face it's a vicious cycle
this stuff gives you a clean break from that vicious cycle i'm freeeee yay
omg my face is balanced after using consistently for less than just a week this stuff gives me hope of a less wrinkly future like i said i'm low maintenance
is still provided enough moisturizer because i don't feel any grease hours after putting in on
my makeup doesn't melt away like before
if your oily it is a must have
being that it's winter time i use a heavier cream at night
people with dry skin might not dig this product like i do since it's very light weight
this is one of the only moisturizers that don't break me out because it has amazing ingredients
struggle finding a moisturizer that doesn't break me out or feel greasy yet is still hydrating
like face wash and something for wrinkles too.
ok i'm going to start by saying that my face is super oily
it's not heavy at all
it's my new go-to
did not leave a heavy tacky residue
did not irritate my eyes like some creams do
i like the smell- although i'd prefer no smell
not greasy at all.
my face didn't feel greasy
that it doesn't make me oily throughout the day
so you can just use this instead of layering anti aging
love that it seems to be smoothing out some of my age lines
maybe that's because i wasn't using a moisturizer on top of it
my skin will be more oily when i don't use this
you would probably want something different at night if you're not excessively oily
i only use this at night however because of the tacky feeling it leaves on my skin
it's not a final moisturizer for me
i love how this comes with a spoon so you don't contaminate the product
i do think it is a bit thin
it hydrates yet does not make me look like an oil slick
that's just how it's packaged
with any other moisturizer you get around 1.7.
love the smell too.
it was way too tacky
the pimples didn't come back
i love that you get a little spatula with the cream
so that you don't have to dip your fingers in
a little seems to go a long way: dipping the spatula into the product once provides enough cream for a full face
there's also a lot of cream in the container
the elements really take a toll on your skin if not removed throughly
washes off makeup so good
doesn't strip my skin
yet melts makeup away
it did not blur my eyes or burn
gentle yet it removes all of my makeup without any irritation
does not leave behind a film or residue
luckily the scent is not overpowering
does not linger once you rinse it off
i wear a lot of makeup
it doesn't irritate my skin so that's what matters most
it doesn't any cause breakouts
only down side is that it doesn't lather as well
even my boyfriend sneaks in some uses!
this product doesn't lather well
after i rinse it off my face it doesn't make my face feel oily or my eyes all blurry
this stuff melts your makeup off.
it even takes off waterproof
it really does seem to dissolve the dirt
the smell is a lot less perfume-y that the other lancome cleansers too
so smooth the smell is amazing not too perfumy which to me is a plus to me removes my makeup so easy i wear smashbox foundation
i don't use makeup remover wipes anymore.
this isn't something that will "dig deep" because it is a cleansing oil
it will prep your skin for the nighttime if you are feeling clean or if you're getting ready to exfoliate
this makes it feel like you're actually cleansing your face instead of just removing your makeup
i don't even need to apply a moisturizer
it doesn't leave a greasy residue or feeling
not wash my face etc
with this cleansing oil you can use way less
a lot of it washes off too unlike other oils where they literally will not budge unless you use a lot of cleanser
removes makeup like nothing i've ever tried before
if anyone is familiar with the la splash liquid lipsticks you know those are next to impossible to remove
it's not too heavy
you'll definitely see a difference in skin clarity
it gets a little milky once you add water
does not create a lather
most cleansers either don't cleanse enough or dry me out too much
then you naturally have to double cleanse anyways
it's not too oily
it breaks down my makeup so easily
does not sting my eyes or irritate my skin
i don't think it's designed to remove eye makeup.
i don't find it does much for uneven complexions
i did not find it sticky at all .
the murad has an odd, almost stale smell.
i would warn to do a good rinse
i am a sucker for anything that will make my skin dewy
i cannot attest if it gets rid of makeup
glowy yet not greasy
i love how easy this oil cleanser is to use.
since it's water based i'm not concerned about my pores
i typically pick up whatever cheap drugstore moisturizer i can find
it is not too oily
it's hard to find product that lives up to its claims
it's doesn't irritate or break me out
don't work well with my skin
to my surprise it is not heavy on my skin
sinks into skin very fast without any greasy ness
i can even go without makeup on days off without feeling like i look sickly from all the redness
nothing else improves my skin texture like this does
you do get a little bit of stickiness
this does not leave any slickness on the skin once it's been absorbed
if you're trying to cover redness
if you find you often use a lavender or pink cc or color corrector with your foundation
i only need one squirt of this
it's not sticky or anything
doesn't make my face feel oily
my skin seems to love it even more now that it's cold out
it's reduced my acne to almost nothing
definitely not a heavy moisturizer
it actually does give you a nice glow, not oily.
i don't personally find it tacky at all.
this gives phenomenal moisture without making you look greasy i have oily skin so my skin does greasy all on it's own
it is watery, but i'm ok with that.
most people are probably thinking this is just a moisturizer when i actually think it's more of a serum/moisturizer hybrid
my makeup wore like it normally does
think this formula works for me because it isn't a heavy moisturizer
i didn't feel like it made my oiliness worse
first, a bit alcohol smelling but that bad to me.
it's a really light formula
esp good for oily or combo skin types for under makeup
light enough for my nose
maybe i'm just too use to thick creams to change.
i would not recommend using this alone of you have dry skin or combo
skin type: super duper dry (but not anymore!!!)
it doesn't feel like a greasy or oily moisturizer
this doesn't leave any residue on your skin or make it feel oily
this actually sinks into your skin
it doesn't bother my sensitive skin too much.
refresh feel to my skin when i don't have time to do full wash
but it doesn't stop at just removing eye makeup.
i even use this stuff for cleaning my brushes between colors
doesn't leave a greasy or sticky feeling
i like that the moisturizer not only mattifies
it never gets oily or tacky or sticky even after hours of wear
usually no matter what i use my face ends up looking like a grease pit
you can feel it make your face matte immediately
it isn't sticky or hard to blend.
absorbs quickly so you can do your makeup with no problems
doesn't make my face too oily
by "mattifying" it means it's just not one of those oily sunscreens that look greasy
sometimes it wouldn't work so
it doesn't help my oily skin
love it - not greasy at all.
very light scent that doesn't linger
it does not smell like sunscreen in the slightest
the fact that it didn't feel like i was pushing it around with the foundation brush
don't have any problems with oil/shine any more
it's just okay my face still gets semi oily through out the day
you'll never be squeezing it out
keeps my makeup on, doesn't sweat off.
i still cannot find a matte primer that works.
i would recommend if you have very oily skin.
doesn't make my face feel greasy or break out like other moisturizers with spf have
i give it 4 stars because i still can't wear it every day without being concerned about clogged pores
this moisturizer doesn't smell like it has spf in it
it does keep you matte
i will admit that toward the end of the 8 hr day my skin will become a bit oily
to be honest i never thought that i could find a daily moisturizer that is mattifying
wouldn't leave my skin greasy
with oily skin it's tough to find a moisturizer with an spf that doesn't feel greasy after applying
this stuff acts almost like a primer making my skin ready for makeup application
i get so many compliments on my skin when i use this moisturizer
though i need to be careful not to over saturate the cotton pad when removing eye makeup
tend to get oily around my t-zone
my face doesn't get nearly 1/2 as oily
doesn't really get down into my skin
that's fine for me cause i just use another lotion that doesn't have spf first
this is the only moisturizer that doesn't leave me a greasy mess in the summer
does what it claims, weightless under my make-up.
i will buy it forever so please sephora don't stop making this moisturizer
i definitely stay matte throughout the day when i don't have makeup on
does not leave a greasy feeling at all
with the spf that's already in it
while at a festival i did not feel my face turn oily like it had with other moisturizers
all moisturizers that say they're mattifying always seem to either flake off or aren't really matte or dry my skin out
my skin tends to get more shiny
acne-prone skin for just about forever
doesn't not cause breakouts
doesn't run off face.
think maybe it could be a bit more spreadable
some are too greasy or heavy feeling
it seems as if the product does last the day without feeling heavy or greasy
hate wearing sunscreen on my face because they tend to make my skin look worse
this is the only moisturizer with spf that does not cause me break out
it doesn't make me oily either.
it's awesome and you can barely smell the spf.
doesn't have that thick texture i hate in the smashbox
this did an amazing job clearing up my skin after using a shea cleanser that what too rich
i don't typically wear foundation
it's one of the only thicker moisturizers i've found that doesn't make me oily through the day
i wish it came in a different package that wasn't so susceptible to bacteria-- i do not care for jar products
anyway, it's so beautiful under makeup.
i don't even have to wear a highlighter with it.
i absolutely did not fine this cream to be heavy or sticky at all
it doesn't break me out which is great because my skin is sensitive
i didn't get flaking or white stuff during use
it doesn't leave your skin oily or leave any residue
you get a little lazy at the end of the day
it does seem to have a cleansing agent in it
i don't want to wash away the benefits
i still do generally rinse this if i can.
it doesn't irritate my eye area
this is the only thing i'll use to take off my makeup when i'm feeling lazy
you can use it on your eyes
i can get a little lazy with my facial care routine
i can get lazy with doing my full cleaning routine
sleeping in this did not break out my sensitive skin
it seems to remove all makeup
i put a little bit on my zit
mpressed because even benzoyl peroxide did not make it shrink
wasn't sure if i would warm up to it
it doesn't necessarily prevent acne
make me more oily it's just good
i know if you have acne prone skin you might be scared of putting oil on your face due to your pores getting clogged
i've noticed that my acne prone skin is hardly getting acne anymore
an underground zit on my check that actually had a visual hole at the top i can no longer feel under my cheek
it's been okay for spot treatment
my otherwise oily skin didn't get greasy throughout the day
you'll recognize the scent
my pores seem less likely to clog the next day
cumin is not ordinarily a smell i like on my person
see if it'll help with my skin
f you have oily/combination skin it's best to only use at night
sometimes i just use it alone without moisturizer before bed
it's like a miracle in a jar
it does say if your skin is prone to purging to use 2-3 x a week
especially if you don't plan on using it 2x a day everyday
i can't attest to how this oil would aid in clearing up major breakouts or chronic acne
it really gets rid of those embarrassing little red bumps aka razor burn
neither leaves it greasy
having combination oily skin really puts you off because you are prone to break outs easily with excess oil on the t-zone
masks weren't cutting it
the breakouts i do get aren't as bad
plain oils weren't quite enough to fix things
usually oils break me out
definitely try this if you have oily
i don't mind the scent at all
it's amazing for acne if you keep with it.
do not mix with makeup
it's not a "beauty oil"
how they treat your skin
even got rid of my grey-ish acne scaring
do not mix this in with moisturizer because it does not sink into the skin
the gunk making it look bad to begin with
occasionally i'll use a little in the morning
the only thing that has worked for my acne without irritating it
which is great because oils usually tend to have the opposite effect on me
it's no reason to knock a star off the rating
no matter what scrub
not all my blackheads are gone
it doesn't smell good though
i usually get at least one zit
as for the smell it's kind of tea-treeish.
it's not a bad smell
it does smell bad
oily skin you may want to read through it
i even mix a drop of this into foundations sometimes
now i occasionally have a superficial whitehead during that time of the month
i don't usually have acne
even in places i don't normally get acne
however it doesn't sink in quickly as advertised
i will warn you it can make your skin feel kinda oily in the morning
the scent doesn't stick around for long
or other skin care products for acne my dermatologist gives me my face peels or totally freak out
my face did not feel oily or slick
not oily at all so far with or without makeup
that it's doubtful to feel heavy
i don't like the smell of it either
i don't even need a moisturizer after this stuff
it is probably because i use a moisturizer underneath
t doesn't matter if my skin is oily anyways
my skin wasn't tight or in need of a moisturizer
yes it's a little smelly
scents usually do not bother me at all
even the severity of that one deep pimple wasn't that bad
this product stinks it smells so foul
don't let the smell discourage you!
it'll literally change your skin.
i don't want some thin veil of gel or whatever just on my face
t doesn't fall off your skin
won't look tacky left on your counter
this isn't a mask that's going to completely change your skin or anything
you instantly feel as if you're in a spa.
it doesn't stay goopey feeling
didn't clog my pores
it does feel like a jelly consistency
it can get a little sticky once it's dried
it is sooo sticky
the way they smell
you can't even smile
people do not like the feel that you are like shrimp that is shrinking
i am combo/oily so that was fine for me
if you can get past the texture
it doesn't sting like some other face mask do
it's so expensive which is the only down side with this mask
just allow some a certain glow on my face.
so what if it feels like jelly?
it doesn't smell fake sweet if you know what i mean
you'll see results in your skins radiance for sure
it doesn't feel sticky at all
gets a little tacky as it sits
i did not have a dull complexion
i also like that it's only a 10 minute mask.
i would really recomend buying it if your skin needs a boost or if you are wanting to get rid of acne scars
it's like someone crushed a bunch of oranges
this guy doesn't notice when i cut my hair more less a change in face regimen
lumps of stuff sitting on my face can't be effective i'd prefer if it had a smooth consistency
it's a little weird when it's on your skin because of the chunks of fruit in it
it is sticky but not too bad.
i like to use a mask almost everyday
so we'll see how it turns out after i wash it off
was flaking no matter how much moisturizer
it didn't take away my acne
it's going to be chunky and slightly sticky.
smells like it too
i tend to slop a lot on my foreh
it is definitely sticky
i know it's supposed to smell like orange citrus
don't know if it's the tool or the cream
i've tried multiple creams that do good for my eyes
the fact that there's no scent is nice too
perfume shouldn't be on the face
this moisturiser doesn't feel any greasy
it's been like an eraser for the dark spots
not another cream product"
i don't think the scent is that bad
i almost don't need much tinted moisturizer mixed in with it or on my skin
it wasn't too much on my olive skin
come on, it's just a moisturizer.
this is just what my skin needs on no-makeup days to give me just a bit of polish
normally scents don't really bother me
i usually only wear eye cream at night or when im just doing err
in other words i don't wear makeup over eye cream ever
i find if you use eye cream every night theres no need for it in the daytime
f you don't like pine needles you might not like this i can't attest to the effectiveness of this product though
i think most people realize that you don't cake on eye crème
a little goes a long way-if it's white or like glue you are using way too much
i actually enjoy using this eye cream
especially if you're mixing it with another eye cream
it sometimes leaves some white stuff around my eyes
in which i can't rub off
they mentioned in store that it's not meant to foam up big time because the ingredients break down makeup
it's the pump/lid that makes it foam on its way out of bottle
it's what's inside that makes this a good cleanser
it does get rid of your makeup
you can get a lot of uses out of this 1 bottle
this mask isn't meant to pull out blackheads
i feel like with most peel off masks i never use enough product
it is sticky and can get messy.
i love that you can peel this off
you have to lay it on quite thick otherwise it peels off in pieces
my oily skin must really like sake
this skin doesn't burn or irritate my skin while on
this doesn't irritate my skin
this mask does all that!
i didn't apply too thick of the layer
the only issue is that you do need a thick layer
t's less messy when you peel it off
it was easy to peel
this eye cream isn't even meant for my age or issues
it does leave it on your skin
my eyes no longer look puffy or tired.
find i can apply makeup over it's slightly tacky feel
the makeup doesn't slip
it's kind of like an overnight mask for my eyes that way
this doesn't travel to my pores
no eye cream can help it
it foams up like crazy
this one doesn't irritate my skin cause it uses witch hazel instead of regular acne control ingredients
you don't have to put much pressure onto your skin while you massage because the foam is doing most of the work
even when they're naturally derived fragrances
i don't normally feel this with other cleansers
you can only really see them if i stick my under my lip
not evert time i cleanse cause i don't like to over do it with that
usually foam products break me out
it only takes a dime sized amount to produce a gentle lather
another cleanser so that your skin does not get bored/tired of the formula
it will sting a bit if you use it to take off your waterproof eye makeup so just make sure you use something beforeh
this doesn't clear up my skin entirely
this is gentle on the skin yet gets the job done.
you do not by any means need to use a penny sized amount as the directions say to get a great lather
my skin doesn't feel tight
i can't believe how much of an impact it's made on my oily skin
powdering throughout the day is no longer a thing
this is the first cleanser that actually makes my skin feel super clean without overly stripping it
sometimes i get breakouts
after i rinse my skin just feels so frickin clean
if you use to much product it can get too foamy
then it stings really badly if you get any foam in your eyes or nose
i usually don't fall for products right away
it does not clog my pores like other previous moisturizers i used in the past
it i do like the texture and formula
* smells wonderful* easy to use
can't state how it removes heavy makeup
the perk is that this stick lasts a really long time compared to liquid formulas
i feel like i waste less product this way rather than gel cleansers
it's not stripping at all.
it's cool to the touch against my face when i use it too
this doesn't irritate me regardless of my skin status
it doesn't strip my skin
it doesn't take off all your makeup with the double cleansing method
i don't have to worry about it spilling
not stripping at all.
it doesn't make a lot of foam
it's not as drying as the sum37 cleanser stick
it's also not entirely dry or oily.
it's a tad bit drying after you wash it off
after using this mask they're gone
in my opinion this mask does it all for my combination skin
because you can feel your pores opening up
it's actually the first mask that hydrates my skin
it does seem to open the pores nicely
the hydration effect doesn't wow me
they are usually just "ok" this mask though
a little too heavy for oily skin though in my opinion
just the occasional whitehead here or there).
the first time, it's super intense.
this mask soothes it like nothing else.
let me also mention that the painful throbbing of my acne is literally gone after i use this mask
i can't say much about softer skin since i'm normally oily anyways
it honestly feels like putting honey on your skin--except you aren't left with a sticky feeling
pity it's so expensive though!
it's a nice light mask that gives you some hydration without feeling oily or too much
this stuff is a miracle in a jar!
with this mask i couldn't resist
clean from the inside -if that makes any sense :
my skin was going crazy due to nasty hormonal acne on one side
it does have a warming sensation which can sting a little
i didn't feel any tingling sensation
it doesn't hurt my skin
if your skin can h
if it covers your face it's enough.
i usually just cleanse my skin
it feels like your skin is just chugging water.
don't just rub it in
almost everything just irritates it
it's the only time my skin gives me problems.
however that doesn't take away from the masks effectiveness
which is why i think it's worked so well on my hormonal acne
it doesn't smell like regular honey
it's gentle enough that it won't cause harmful affects if your skin really needs extra attention
couldn't ask for a nicer mask.
it does not cause breakouts or irritation.
if you are oily it will help balance
it didn't break me out of clog my pores
it wasn't as intense
buuut i feel like my face is purging
i love this acne clearing wash it doesn't get rid of your acne overnight or anything
it doesn't irritate my skin
now i rarely get pimples and blemishes!
so my skin wasn't use to the climate there
i don't rely on washes to clear my acne as i can't imagine a product that's on my skin for 1 minute can perform miracles
i don't have bad acne
i didn't notice that it has salicylic acid in it though
i barely get any pimples now
which i usually like
it doesn't smell amazing
so now i just suffer from pimple scaring
it's a gel so you only need a little
it's seriously helped clear up my skin
people don't realize all acne medications practically do this
there's no preventing it
doesn't strip the skin
it's a perfect spot treatment because it's light enough to wear during the day under makeup
to the point where some light exfoliation usually buffs it out
it usually takes three nights to get rid of a pimple for me
while it is true that it has an unpleasant smell
it helps get rid of those really bad big ugly zits quickly without me having to pop it
it rubs in really easily
this product is great for treating those pesky breakouts that pop up
i don't get bad acne often
do get one or two stubborn
the smell isn't even that bad.
of course it's going to smell weird it has sulfur in it
the part that sucks is there's a lot of excess packaging that doesn't have any product in it
don't care much about the smell
i can wear less makeup or no make up at all
if you want to clear your acne, get this product.
it's not terribly drying.
it does smell a little because of the sulfur
i even prefer it over retin-a
recommend using it with a good mousiterizer or maybe even a hydrating mask
anything more looks tacky
i don't wear makeup
it doesn't feel cakey or break me out
it's not meant to replace a moisturizer.
i usually wear it alone
ladies should never cheap out on skin care
skin care above makeup, always.
i do really like this makeup remover!
this remover doesn't irritate
there's usually a decent amount of makeup residue left
i might try a couple other makeup removers
i've notice my skin is smoother doesn't get irritated
it doesn't take off makeup quite as well
my mother got my this as a christmas present because she thought i used the milk cleanser when i actually use the regular cleanser
since i tend to wear heavy eye makeup
this does not strip your skin of any hydration which is a great thing
if you wear eye makeup you will want to use a separate makeup remover
because the tarte one made me break out a lot
that won't leave you with the squeaky clean feeling
i wouldn't recommend using it to remove makeup though
it's not going to give you that stripped squeaky clean feeling
you can rinse with water too
i could no longer hide with my face moisturizer.
isn't greasy on my combination skin
it doesn't leave any greasy feeling.
it's a cool texture too.
when you first put it on it's like a thick lotion
it's basically magic in a tube.
even though i'm combination normal to oily i feel there's times where my skin needs your hydration
the oils i'm using aren't enough
after activating the emotion with water i can't believe how smooth
i don't like to typically add anything on top
makeup goes on smooth even without primer.
sometimes it tends to look very dull when i wake up
my skin wasn't irritated after use
your skin will love you for it.
my skin was getting super flakey
i usually don't like using a lot of products
i picked this as one of my samples loved the results so much i know which areas on my skin are saggy
the price per ounce isn't too bad.
i can't wait until i finish the other cleanser i am using
moisturizer just as i normally would
i don't find it overpowering
my skin can't get enough of flash hydroboost.
so does my skin
i just can't get over my smooth, plump skin.
i wanted something non-oily to use as a clean
it's not a heavy emulsion
the smell doesn't last
when you don't get enough water in your body
if you do too much water you'll rinse it off.
was going to throw it away since i don't usually have good luck with moisturizers
doesn't leave it sticky
texture are so even
though i don't use on eyes
it does get ur skin squeaky clean without stripping
then it's my turn
so the packaging doesn't lie
yes, it removes my makeup.
so can't comment on eye makeup removal
i didn't feel like was scrubbing to get muy make up off
i don't use wipes anymore
i am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because it can't take off eye makeup as well
makes you realize just how much residue of makeup one can have even after cleansing
it's so satisfying to see all the dirt
the only reason for not getting five stars is it doesn't completely remove waterproof eyeliner which is a bummer
when you rinse the product off your skin does not feel like it has a film on it
on my lazy days i do the cotton pad
during the day my skin doesn't get as oily as it use to which was very bad
it is important to note that this cleanser does not foam up
it's super hard for me to find makeup wipes/cleansing waters that won't burn my skin
the scent isn't really noticeable- it definitely doesn't smell bad
i don't like the smell or the greasy feel
doesn't wimp out after a little while
'm a sucker for face mask treatments
i forget about it sometimes
it didn't make me feel like a grease ball either
however: i find it messy to use
which is what i like in a mask
i know some people complain about the spatula
i usually rub it in
so now it's useless
get an even layer
leaves face oily so no need to add anything else after
only thing i hated was that some of the mask goes through the kleenex
it doesn't leave any weird residue.
if there's residue left, you just rub that in.
if you don't wrap your magnet in tissue you're going to have a hard time getting the mask off it
i admit i was skeptical of the gimmicky idea of magnets on the face
it does not disappoint my post menopausal face
just kind of a bummer when you consider the cost that the magnet is so easily breakable
i totally got sucked in to the gimmick of the magnet
be careful you don't get the stuff on the magnet because it's quite difficult to remove if you do
i can't stop looking in the mirror
see it you don't get a compliment on your skin
i also like the no rinsing off part too.
f you have some acne that you would want covered before an event use this mask it reduces the inflammation
redness to allow you makeup to apply better to help coverage plus it gets rid of all your dead skin
i love this mask because there is no rinsing required
because i often feel too goopy
but i couldn't resist the magnet gimmick.
someone with oily skin may not benefit from this.
after you remove it it leaves a kind of serum that it tells you to rub into your skin
you need very little to use as you put a thin layer on
it does help with redness but not instantly.
it happens everyone's skin is different
you need this mask
i don't think it's anti aging at all
i normally prefer cloth masks because its easier then masks wash off type masks imo
what's great about this product is when you use the metal to get the magnet off you're left with no product on your skin
what's left behind to massage into your skin smells nice
its not messy at all and easy to remove.
it doesn't do anything like bubble or tingle.
i would recommend not using toilet paper haha because the mask itself truly is magnetic
people with oily skin may not like this.
once you remove it with the magnet it leaves a nice silky residue that you massage into your skin which makes your skin feel so smooth
you will notice a soft yet kinda oily residue left on your skin
it's the least messy mask i've used to date.
i didn't notice any visual difference in my skin other then feeling super hydrated
this stuff is so cool the way it's removed with a magnet
i recommend using it before you go to bed so your skin
have that odd combo of some acne
i used the little spatula thing it came with
it's amazing not to have to use water at all to remove such an effective mask
it's actually mind blowing!!!
if u have an oily skin type do a really good deep cleanse first as this is hydration extreme
i didn't need to scrub it off with a face cloth
it may seem "greasy" however
again do not rinse off with water or any liquid
all you need to do with that is rub it in
you definitely need to use the spatula to put this mask on your face
it kind of tickles when you remove it.
you're going to look like a melting smurf for a few minutes
not messy at all as it peels off quite nicely
there was enough mixture in one mask mix for both my boyfriend
it does contain oils so couldn't use my loves
i do like that this mask gives you extra mixing comes so you don't have to clean them like my other modeling masks however this is probably not to green
i find i need a thicker
not hundreds of dark pores i've had ppl ask what are those dots all over your face?
i never was able to wear glowy foundations or put highlight on my cheekbones
so deep i couldn't even extract them
i'd be so desperate just for smooth skin i'd accept the redness
i don't like scrubs daily even though those helped turn my skin over more than just washes
it's never irritated my skin i can build it up onto spots that are alil more stubborn without redness or dryness
wasn't too harsh on my skin
i don't even use wipes anymore.
doesn't dry out my face like other cleansers!
sometimes have to do a double wash to get rid of all of my makeup
as long as there's no alcohol
i would probably prefer it to be less foamy
it doesn't leave any weird residue on the face.
my skin doesn't feel tight or irritated after using it
you want to put nourishment
not stripping at all
it doesn't aggravate my skin
i love the scent and the price isn't bad at all.
which is essential for me since there are some nights that i forget/am too lazy to moisturize after
it is not overpowering nor unpleasant
don't like the fact that it smells like veggies
notice that i don't get any of the huge pimples like i usually do
thankfully no more annoying dry patches anymore
my face doesn't feel too dry or too oily.
if you tend toward dryer skin
my face is easy to please
i always have a hard time finding a cleanser that deep cleans without being too harsh on my skin
it is so gentle that i cannot promise wheather my face is cleansed enough at the end of day
someone may feel it is hard to rinse off
it's so refreshing that i look forward to washing my face
in the mornings i use the ole hendriksen balance skin care routine
the pump doesn't lock
it spreads nicely so you don't even need a full pump for your face
i love that it is in a glass bottle rather than plastic
that's normal for me even when i use non-foaming cleansers
it's gentle enough that i can use it to remove my makeup too
it forms a nice lather in my h
i don't find it blows me.
but it's a good cleanser
doesn't strip my skin
combine it with ciates makeup melter on days i am wearing quite a bit of eye makeup
doesn't strip my skin
i always remove my makeup before cleansing
i love the fact that this product does not have a lot of hard to pronounce-synthetic-chemicals in it
i wouldn't recommend keeping a bottle of this product for shower
if you wear a lot of eye makeup you may want to use an eye makeup remover first
can't wait to check out more from this brand!
it lathers really easily
not some hard plastic
but i don't love that it's a sudsy cleanser.
i assume it's stripping my face
i don't use this cleanser all the time
i do love it for the times my face needs to feel extra clean versus the jelly-type cleanser i use normally
which is kind of annoying cause i'm getting ided bars
if your are dry, it's ok to use this.
it's important to add a little water to the cleanser in your h
it doesn't foam up much
otherwise i love this cleanser
usually i would just stop using a product if it caused that much irritation to my skin
that's usually how it goes with my skin
use a makeup remover wipe to get off the excess makeup i wasn't able to wash off
it is so gentle yet it takes it all off
without having the bad chemicals like other washes
i feel it's a bit drying
that's not bad for me cuz it dries out my acne
just bad air etc
was in the hunt for a good cleanser that won't
ytp moisturizer doesn't have any dimethicone my skin loves it no breaks outs it's light weight good for oiler skin
normal skin with love it to since it's light weight
doesn't leave my face sticky or shiny
feels a lot less tacky
it's perfect for summer because it's not too thick
not feel any irritation
it's more like a gel than it is a cream
which i looove in the summer months when i don't need as much hydration
the most important thing is my face isn't that oily anymore
usually the day after i go out i'll get a zit or 2
my skin will be flakey
which does wonders for your skin
still very hydration without going overboard
it comes with a little scoop that i use to get it out of the jar
whenever i wear it
i think this one is worth it if you've got oily skin like mine
it has no oily or tacky feeling at all
it comes with a little spatula which i sometimes use to apply it to help avoid bacteria production in the jar
its light on the skin and doesn't leave me shiny.
didn't notice any grease from it
love how it comes with a little spoon.
i decided to try this moisturizer when my skin got dull
it smells like exaclty what the ingredients are
doesn't make the skin feel oily or slick
doesn't stick to skin unless you apply it with this stuff
non greasy just right
over an hour or so you could literally fry an egg on my face it gets so oily
the scent is just ok
often can't smell well anyway
doesn't just sit on the skin
i don't think it will make my skin oily
i also love that it's more natural
it doesn't irritate my skin
this doesn't aggravate it
doesn't test on animals
if i use any other creme instead then my makeup always seems to be cakey
i don't typically like lotions/creams because i have so many already at home that do not work with my skin
it's not quite heavy enough for me during these winter months
it's always hard to differentiate between moisturizers
doesn't have a strong smell
i would say it's more of a summer moisturizer
doesn't leave my skin looking oily
hate most moisturizers because they slide off my skin
it's still baby bottom smooth
my face is no longer an oily mess
it doesn't clump or pill under my foundation
i don't wear makeup
it doesn't feel oily
it doesn't completely moisturize
it's not greasy or sticky and it smells ok.
it does this without feeling heavy or greasy
it seems like this cream
this basically melts into your skin like
it's not too heavy or greasy
i typically have 2-3 blemishes on my face at all times
not that the roebucks isn't anti-aging
does not leave a greasy finish
it is lightweight so your skin doesn't feel sticky after applying
not greasy at all
i like the fact that this comes with a little plastic spatula so that i can scrape every last bit of cream out of the jar
doesn't leave you feeling greasy or oily
the smell isn't bad
i've found okay stuffs that don't irritate me
it didn't get rid of my dark spots completely
so make sure you've used a spray or a toner first
the fact that it doesn't soak into your skin right away
this serum somehow delivers everything i could ask for
glowing beauty that you only see in movies or magazines where you know makeup is being used
how it doesn't sting
i don't even have to use foundation or concealer anymore
it's best applied with a brush vs
when it comes to skin care
i apply this stuff one pump
the pump may spray the stuff with more force than you think
i usually have 2-3 blemishes on my face at all times
after a week there's a real difference to my skin
it's a tiny jar but a little goes a long way.
want to coverup some imperfections without looking like you packed it on
i don't even wear foundation over it!
it sucks that it only comes in one color.
it's always a struggle to cover the redness without wearing a million layers of makeup
usually feel disgusting by mid-day
it's literally changing my life!
it's the only thing that has ever made my redness disappear
note: i do use a heavy moisturizer- makeup really shouldn't dry me out
it also doesn't feel cakey as when i have foundation on
normal concealer doesn't even cover as good as this cream
i wasn't expecting it to even really have a tint since it was a cream
i don't need to wear foundation or powder on top of this
it works for me because it's my skin tone
my only gripe about that was it had to be set with some translucent powder or else it would get oily on you
it does a good job covering my redness
i can even wear blush now!!
my only complaint is that i have to wear concealer/foundation on top because it's too dark for my skin tone
i don't mind that it's in a tub
it's thick so you have to be careful to apply very little
on lazy days this could be worn alone
makes my skin look so even that i don't even need tinted moisturizer
which becomes a problem when it's time to contour
it's a perfect color regardless of whether my skin is more tan or more fair
paired with my medium coverage foundation though it's almost flawless
this is heavy and doesn't cover anything.
it's evens out my skin
i cannot live without this product i have acne scars
not only is it at least 2 shades too dark
doesn't irritate my skin
it doesn't crease at all
i can't stop looking in the mirror!
i do use under my abh banana stick foundation/highlighter when i want full makeup look
stays put but isn't heavy.
please make this in a tube like your foundations
coverage either has to be so thick that i look like i have fake skin
i can never find something that doesn't enhance dry patches
doesn't irritate my skin
to all the reviewers saying that this shade is not universal or didn't match their skin tone
it's because this is made to go under your foundation
there's only one color
you're out of luck if you're too dark or too fair
yes this is pretty much like a full cover concealer
it's almost too dark for me
sometimes i forget about it
if i use too much it can be cakey once my foundation is applied
i recommend not sticking a bigger/fluffier brush into the jar bc it would pick up way too much product
just don't like that it can settle or look like your skin is cracking if you are covering bad rosacea
i can't wear full coverage make up to work since it gets really hot in a kitchen
it's just something you'll notice
it's been really hard to find products to minimize the redness in order for makeup to look how it's suppose to
you know like a bag of chips that's 50% air.
i guess higher melanin skin tones don't produce rosaeca?
even my skin tone
it really does cancel out the red spots/blotches i seem to get r
there are not enough adjectives to describe how this product covers a multitude of skin problems
i don't look like i'm wearing foundation
it's not expensive and it looks natural.
it's smoother than butter!
i also don't have to wear primer or powder.
i can't believe that i have found this after 6 years of trying every product from dirt cheap to luxe prices
i think a beauty blender would also do the trick
i find that on my skin tone once it's on
once you layer your concealer over it you can't see how dark this shade is
the definition of "use sparingly" for me is to put some on my face or brush that's so small i can hardly see it
i may look like i have makeup on
the tiny jar just doesn't last very long.
the color doesn't go well with my complexion
it is does not go with my complexion color
some days i'm just too lazy to put on makeup
when i don't wear makeup
my face just looks dirty
i often wear only this because it totally covers my redness
either the color was off or the texture was wrong
unlike the usually sticky green stuff
it's not heavy at all.
most concealers just don't cut it
i can't stand products in pots and jars.
don't even have shades light enough
its not meant to make acne disappear.
it's purpose is not to hide your bumps
it doesn't give you the weird white cast that greens tend to give
we're often told that to correct redness
but that's quite true for a deep redness.
doesn't set on top of skin
it's more of a watered down cream
it doesn't leave my face feeling oily
this product doesn't irritate it at all
which if you don't know doesn't get all of your water resistant/cry proof
if i'm feeling not too easy that night i'll cleanse my face after
you are just not going to do multiple steps because you are taking off your waterproof stage makeup at 5am while your drunk
this stuff removes it all
doesn't leave a weird feeling on my skin
it gets off my they're real mascara from benefit which is almost impossible for me to remove
the smell was awful i can't take it
it's better to keep face clean than to worry bout the smell
others require scrubbing or make your face feel yucky
you can see the makeup simply lifting off your face
it doesn't leave my skin oily afterwards
you better use a spoon or something to get the product when using
doesn't leave any residue
not only does it clean off all my makeup
it gets it off with no hassle
due to the fact that it couldn't remove my waterproof mascara/tightline
if you're not wearing waterproof makeup
you'll have to follow up with another cleanser
i do wish it had a spatula because it almost has a consistency of coconut oil
it will make you foggy visioned if you do not rinse well
it does not leave the skin feeling greasy
this doesn't irritate my sensitive eyes at all.
step two you can't mess it up
creaky this is without being greasy
it really works great at taking off my stubborn mascara as well as the rest of the layers of product on my skin
it literally melts the makeup off just like it says it will
i hate sticking my fingers in any type of pot product
i don't just rinse this off i use a washrag to remove it
love this product it removes everything from my makeup its a most in your makeup bag love it will purchase again
just as an excuse to wash my face with it
makeup remover for the lazy-night-non-facewashers like myself
that does not have the mild cleansing power like this does
need something that'll cleanse my pores
truly breaks down all of your makeup
thoroughly cleanses because i still get occasional breakout
event though it's a balm/oil it washes away really clean feeling
gets most of my makeup off
it's very gentle and doesn't break me out.
have only found 2 makeup removers that work for me without stripping my skin completely
it does seem to leave a slight residue once i wash it off
my gentle cleanser just wasn't getting everything off
i love that you don't have to wet your face before applying
i would always use a makeup wipe to remove my makeup
then you smell the product
this one really does remove waterproof eye makeup
doesn't take a lot to remove your makeup
no need to rub hard
it didn't remove mascara that well
otherwise it's a good product
i love how it melts off all of my makeup.
it doesn't seem to really get my skin super clean
it just smells like plastic
you can wash it off
still wash your face after or you can just wipe it off with a makeup eraser sooo easy
i would have to use it twice to completely get rid of my mascara
it also was able to get rid of super bright lipstick
i love that this remover is both heavy duty in the sense of removing all your makeup
it also doesn't strip your skin of moisture like it claims
i didn't use it on my cheeks or skin other than my eyes just because i use a face wash for that
it doesn't get rid of everything
i usually use this before a shower
it's so effective at taking off makeup
it doesn't have too much of a scent
definitely worth a try ifyou've never tried a makeup removing balm
even the hardcore eye makeup ill throw on occasionally it just melts it away
need something that will remove all the mascara
if you are lazy that night
as i haven't worn makeup everyday
i can't comment on those who use waterproof mascara
this cleansing balm is amazing because it takes off all of my makeup easily
t doesn't burn when i use it on my eyes or irritate my skin in any way
the best part is that it doesn't make my skin feel greasy after use or leaves a film on my face
highly recommend to anyone who doesn't like to waste time after a long night to remove their makeup
i prefer this even over my eve lom cleansing balm
this makes your skin look poreless!
easily melts when you scoop it out in your h
doesn't sting the eyes
it does what it's indended to do: blur your skin
squeeze tube combo makes it so easy to get product out
if you are not super oily
try it, this one's a keeper :-)
i just repeurchased this primer
it doesn't make my pores completely disappear
it doesn't break up or get cakey like it used to
the fact that it doesn't have a strong fragrance
it's perfection for applying makeup
this primer is amazing it does the job by getting rid of all your pores
it's a little runnier than a normal primer.
make sure to let this primer soak into the skin a little bit
makes my makeup look
isn't greasy or tacky whatsoever
it doesn't make me oily or anything.
it doesn't leave that greasy feeling like the porefeessional
my makeup doesn't slide around or cake up
if it pills up on you, youve applied too much.
if you get a white residue you've used too much !
it's too bad it doesn't work for these other ladies
when it comes in contact with sunlight things could get bad
i can't really wear too much makeup as it's considered unprofessional in my line of work
i only use it at night since it's heavy.
everyone's skin is different
does not leave an oily or greasy feeling
doesn't feel heavy at all
this one doesn't erase dark circles as well as murad or clinique did
(yes, i used it on my lids too!)
i do look strange without my darker undereye
i like seeing it out on my vanity
i can wear makeup over it no problem
whenever i set my under eye area with translucent powder or even if it was just foundation it would always crease into those lines no matter what i did
i do not use this cream before putting makeup on i notice it makes my eyes crease a lot more
it's like a time machine for your face.
the eyelid skin that sometimes hangs over my eyelashes doesn't anymore
this anti aging eye cream is legit.
all my life i've had puffy eyes that make it look like i never sleep or have bad allergies
large pores so sometimes im scrubbing my face to make sure my pores are clean
dont rub it on your eye
don't have a ton of wrinkles
seems to make it a bit puffy
it doesn't break me out, or dries out my skin.
you say you'll cure my dark circles
the reviews from it cosmetics looked too alluring for me to ignore
i didn't expect this cream to do anything for my undereye puffiness or bags
it's like a fresh pressed juice for your skin.
this eye cream really sinks in
doesn't leave a greasy film to interfere with eye makeup
t doesn't leak into my eyes even if i apply it close
nice thick cream and you only need a little bit.
it is so thick that you barely see it with any other eye cream
it's super bouncy is how i want to describe it
it doesn't like run into my eyes which is what i usually encounter with most eye creams
they're starting to not be as puffy
is the best under eye concealer to hide darkness no matter if it's red or blue
it's never too early to start a skin care regime
have struggled to find a moisturizer that doesn't break me out
it is not greasy at all
even though it's pricey
it's a thick cream that doesn't feel thick
doesn't leave it greasy
it's not greasy or heavy at all
when you have acne you are always trying to dry out your blemishes
doesn't leave you oily or feeling clogged.
my makeup goes on so smooth
it wasn't a bad scent by any means
if the scent bothers you drink tea make it hot let the steam hit your eyes before you apply
the smell isn't bothersome to me
it's made my skin super smooth and clear.
it can be difficult for me to find a moisturizer that is thick enough to last the day/night without my skin literally itching for another application without it feeling heavy/greasy
it also still didn't feel heavy despite how thick it is
this stuff melts right into your skin!
nor did it make it oily
my skin is picky about what it accepts
it's not greasy and i just love it on my skin!
i still am amazed that it feels supple instead of it's usually dry flakiness
wouldn't recommend using it all over your face unless you dull it down because it will probably cause breakouts
it does not make skin greasy.
i find that the smell of this one is light
i can use this moisturizer during the day without it being greasy
there's no issues with wearing it under makeup
won't be wearing it under a lot of makeup on my combo skin
it does have a slight greasy feel once applied yet quickly melts into the skin
i just don't see those lines i mean i frown
but those annoying lines???!!
does not feel greasy during the day
once it absorbs into your skin it's weightless
it doesn't make my face greasy by the end of the day
if you're concerned with looking oily at all
t doesn't just lay on top of the skin
love that it doesn't make your face so shiny
dont feel like it just rubs off on my pillow when i go to bed
which it what it's labeled as
it doesn't make my rosacea flare
morning and night, it's all i need.
really helps with zits/acne in the t-zone
it doesn't cause any irritation
it's not a miracle cream
doesn't completely get rid of it
idk if it's from the cream or other things
it's helped so much with everything including redness
sometimes all over my face
this cream is potent stuff.
it kind of get oily like an hour after you apply
the cream is thick consistency so you don't have to use a lot per use
it is a bit tacky like other reviewers have said
if you use too much it will smother your face in a greasy way in a hot climate
also doesn't leave my already oily skin a wet mess
acne skin it cant get worse
my skin doesn't rash or get red
it doesn't make it oily
this stuff is on the thicker side
a bit of redness once i put this on i feel like my skin can breath
and it doesn't sting like so many moisturizers.
even out the skin
it's on it's way
it's tight but not drying what so ever.
i think it's a little "thick" feeling to wear under makeup
i seem to have a new spot forming in a place where i don't usually break out
probably nothing a setting powder wouldn't fix.
anytime your skin is red
sometimes, i will use it all over my face.
you still might need another moisturizer
this stuff its amazing if you have oily
it's just an added bonus that it moisturizes too!
because it's expensive i personally wouldn't use it as a daily moisturizer
doesn't clog my pores or break me out
barely need any makeup
it's a bit sticky when you apply it
i like the tube package too.
has a recurring rash that i can't seem to shake
it can feel just a little oily
while not irritating it
it doesn't help any acne i have
this cream comes in a tube which i fairly enjoy because it's easy to apply
do tend to add a drop of one of my favorite essences just to help out a bit
i do think that if you tend to have dryer skin
it's definitely thicker than most moisturizers
this has helped my "unfixable" minnesota dry skin
it did not clog my pores at all
it doesn't stay on thick like neosporin would
it's even gotten rid of old acne scars
it doesn't give me pimples or excess oil.
i think if you don't like the pale look
even the thickest creams don't help long term.
i don't know about it helping with blemishes
when i do get a zit
this cream isn't like the typical spot zit treatment
if you're into facial oils like myself this is a good base for an oil
i felt like this cream would break me out for it is bit sticky
it has helped the small amount of acne along my jawline i can never really get rid of
after a few days my skin felt tacky
doesn't feel oily when you apply it
it's the beauty equivalent of the hydrocortisone or neosporin you use before putting on a b
love how rich this cream is- it's difficult to find something with this consistency that doesn't eventually lead to breakouts
i like how thick it is because it stays on
i don't find that it clogs my pores at all
it doesn't leave any white cast
everything either wasn't enough moisture
didn't leave me feeling greasy
like there usually is
today i can't see any redness
since i'm only 20 i don't use an eye cream
redness shows up so easily on me
it's thick but i love that.
oily-ness is starting to tone down too
it doesn't feel heavy or greasy like some creams do
the ones that claim to get rid of my acne dries out my skin so bad
can't speak to it's effectiveness for those with redder complexions
don't have to wear foundation
at least i have a "makeup" that doesn't make my face look cakey or fake
doesn't feel overly heavy or make me too shiny in the florida humidity
it evens my skin tone enough that i only need some concealer
somehow less reactive to the things that caused me to get redness
even out my skintone
i just wear it by itself with a little concealer
you'll be good to go
this doesn't turn my face any color
my very white skin doesn't notice
just don't use it as a replacement for your morning moisturizer as it can be a little drying
unless i caked it on like a saturday night party which is not natural or optimal for work or day time use or i found i spent tons of money changing product to product when i realized it really didn't look good on me
with my redness it's really hard to resist using foundation or concealer
i don't have to put any makeup on when i'm wearing this stuff
it's a great natural look if you're trying to cut back on makeup use
your skintone is more even
there's no denying that my skin looks good
don't use every day
this product really is more like a bb cream than a moisturizer which i suppose is because of the color correction
products often make me look washed out because i don't spend any time outside to get an actual tan
if you're concerned about the color
i am usually too lazy to write products
if i get those bumps
if you want a very light color corrector for everyday this is for you
doesn't take away all color
that is my skin base then i will add blush
my skin is even
i don't feel a bit of grease from the product or oil from my face
i do feel that it's more for skin that's more pale
as it will leave you a bit shiny after application
i wear this everyday with or without makeup
i like this product as a quick even out before tinted moisture
i don't mind the texture
i prefer it as a base underneath makeup
can really only use this when my skin condition is good because it does emphasize dry flakes/spots since it's matte
it's really like a cc cream with out that super glowy look
i apply a little bit of highlighter
with red undertones that regular foundation never really seemed to cover correctly
without not using makeup
sometimes i have those days where i want to let my skin breath
while this covers my red spots usually pimple scars or just red little patches it also gives me a great amount of coverage i love it
even still, a holy grail for me!
i only use concealer if i have a zit or on my dark circles if i know i'll be in a lot of pictures
you do have to let it soak in your skin a little before applying more product to the face
i am blessed with clear skin so red spots or acne is not a problem
throughout the day i notice that my skins doesn't get as red as it usually does as my foundation fades
as long as i spread it out it does not clog my pores
definitely too thick to wear under makeup
i don't use much to cover my redness so this tub will last me a long time
i don't even need to wear a heavy coverage foundation anymore
it doesn't leave a heavy feeling
it didn't feel greasy, sticky.
blemishes if i have them
doesn't turn in to an oil slick
usually don't feel like i need it
i especially love how it's packed with spf
it'll make you look very shiny
i didn't expect to like the cream since it seemed pretty heavy in the jar
towards the end of the day it does get a little oily
my face doesn't feel oily
sometimes i don't even put foundation on over it because my skin looks
i don't use foundation only a concealer for all these problem spots
when you have fair skin you have to press the product into your skin do not rub it in
i cannot imagine my makeup routine without it
it doesn't work that fast
now i don't deel lazy about removing makeup since it does the work real quick
it also doesn't leave my skin greasy.
the reason i can't give it five stars is it does leave a bit of a weird smell
it gets all of your most stubborn makeup
however it didn't dissolve my waterproof mascara
it won't sting your eyes for eye makeup either.
just a little dab gets all my makeup off
you barely need any to get off all your makeup
i find it doesn't leave any residue like other makeup melters
it doesn't clog pores
i love that it doesn't irritate my eyes
i only use it on my eye makeup
as it's quite thick
be careful though if it gets into your eye it burns
i will definitely be buying the big jar of this makeup remover
you don't have to use any cotton rounds or anything to rub it on
the smell doesn't smell to good.
the oily feel does a great job at breaking down even the most stubborn waterproof mascara
it's like an oil
shouldn't be your one
you should always double cleanse if you have applied anything to your face
my only con is that i wouldn't say it leaves my face feeling moisturized
i don't necessarily use a cleanser on my face that night
i don't usually splurge on cleansers since they don't stay on the skin very long
this boscia one doesn't blur my vision
love the smell works great doesn't bother my eyes
t doesn't pull at your skin
i find it does leave a bit of a residue if you don't use a washcloth to remove it
nothing a little micellar water can't take off
even the lash glue that can take a few passes normally
sticky when you first apply it because you don't get it wet at first
usually it takes a couple times to get all of the eye stuff off
it really melts my makeup.
even if you have oily skin like i do
it takes off my make up even when it's layered on
i love that it's dark grey, almost black.
i don't wear eye make-up so have not used it on my eyes
it's like a gel that you just rub onto your makeup then rinse off
and it's not liquid so easy to carry around.
this product didn't have the oily feeling.
the reason it's a 4 star is because it did not remove all my waterproof mascara like it claimed to do
it's so easy to use
i do wash my face with my usual facewash
my eyes are so sensitive that everything i've ever tried to remove eye makeup irritates my eyes to no end
it doesn't sting or irritate at all
it even took off black eyeliner like it was nothing
doesn't leave steaks of mascara all over my face
it doesn't leave an oily or greasy finish either
it doesn't cause irritation
your skin does not feel oily after or have a build up
if you've never used a balm before you have to realize it will go on sticky
your face wash routine should not be fast
you need to take your time cleansing your skin
it's not called a skin care routine for nothing
it's so easy to use effectively
even you dont use a soap
it's not greasy at all
you can definitely use a soap or cleansing foam if you want to
it really does melt your makeup so quickly
not even the least bit oily
this concept since it's not a tradition mask
this mask is so simple it's ridiculous.
however once you add a little water to emulsify it
didn't leave any residue
it doesn't make my combination type skin any oiler
even when i tone afterwards there's no left over makeup on the cotton pad
i've tried so many things to remove mascara
my friends tease me that i wear so little makeup that i don't need an extra step of a melt away to clean my skin
i do recommend a heavy moisturizer after this melt away as it is
isn't lazy to take there time cleaning there face after makeup
i like this one more because it doesn't leave a greasy film on contacts like the clinique one does
i can't stop touching my face!
because i don't have to worry about making a mess over my sink/counter
i don't mind the smell
this does not irritate or inflame my skin
i don't wear foundation everyday
i like it because unlike other balms it comes off easly with water
gave it a 4 because it's a little pricey
it really melts it all off before you use your actual facial cleanser
doesn't bother my eyes
this product can take it all off with no work or harsh scrubbing
i hate most face wipes because
this gets rid of all the makeup with no film
it's not drying at all.
you do have to give it time to dissolve the makeup
please change the smell
benefit they're real push up eyeliner- it works on everything
not only did all my makeup melt off
didn't quite make the grade: foundation residues
not to mention my regular makeup
it's a non-messy way to wash your face at the end of the day
wipes aren't strong enough to do the job
it doesn't irritate my eyes at all
this took off my colour pop matte lipstick like it was nothing
didn't hurt my lips or skin
this not only moisturized enough to get rid of any dryness
do not rinse off!!
however, this is too oily for my face.
huge skeptic- i'm never satisfied with moisturizers- got a sample of this- thought it was gimmicky
in the morning i mix a little into my regular moisturizer so my makeup can glide on smooth
usually dont stray away from aveda
you can imagine what condition my skins in
it's like my skin is back to normal .
i don't use it as a "splash mask"
this winter has made it even worse as i can't wear any makeup without it looking extremely cakey
kinda let the mask sit
didn't need any moisturizer
i love that you can use it in the shower
there's no odor that i've noticed
it is basically oil, so i mix it with lotion.
even though i used the scrub to get rid of them it wouldn't go away
i usually like the skin care from boscia
this is wonderful if your skin is going through a rough patch or it's the dead of winter
doesn't leave a greasy residue
i don't enjoy the smell either
i cannot deny that it's hydrating
somehow this stuff calms it down
can't speak for the anti aging effect
i generally don't wear moisturizers during the day because my skin can get oily
its not an eye cream
have used pretty much every anti-aging cream
it's the opposite of greasy
it doesn't leave my face greasy like other products
it doesn't irritate my eyes at all
was a little worried it wouldn't be hydrating enough
i don't know about skin lifting or wrinkle reduction
even though it's pricy
i do think this would be too heavy for daytime use for me
it's my go to cream this winter!
usually i can't use a cream during a day
never seem to be able to find a firming moisturizer that doesn't feel heavy when i wear makeup
even when i don't use primer
it's not too greasy
after trying probably 10-12 face creams
i mean all skin types
even texture is what i get with this
didn't clog my pores
the little scoop and packaging is cute too!
the skin sucks it up like water in a dessert
if you're have a normal skin tone
no matter how hard i try to moisturize in the winter
as for the smell, i don't mind it at all.
it has an organic smell which puts me at ease knowing that it isn't filled with perfumes simply to please a picky nose
everything i tried was either too greasy
there's no fragrance, so you get the real deal.
as it's a bit too heavy for my skin
you'll know- because it does feel greasy
it really does conceal your pores.
i literally can't smell anything from it
i don't find it to be overly greasy or heavy like a lot of night creams i've tried are
it was not greasy
this product somehow shrinks them
it's funny how life works out.
i love that it's non toxic and all natural.
i do recommended if you have oily or combo skin
my skin didn't feel oily or greasy at all
my skin goes through a weird phase during season changes so my cheeks have been on the flaky side while my t-zone area has been borderline oily--
i love how it doesn't leave my skin oily
i can't get enough of the scent-- subtle
doesn't irritate my skin
it is the perfect texture and not too greasy.
it's been an easy go to
the only thing that keeps it away it's benezoyl peroxide which is soooo drying
even oil free products will occasionally break me out
it's not heavy at all
non greasy moisturizer that would help even out my skin's texture
i think it's because of this lxmi balm because the rest of my routine is the same
i scoop just enough to cover the little spatula it comes with
sometimes it gets full-blown flakey from the peels
lxmi balm-to-oil doesn't break me out
pray for me cause i can't stop touching my face
it looks flawless in the morning when i usually look like an overtired raccoon
scars + it's keeping my acne under control
the tiniest bit of this balm goes a super long way
melt is a true balm-to-oil meaning it does not soak into the skin quickly
t was a little "thick" for me by itself
it really does melt with your body heat
it does not leave behind an extra greasiness
i would recommend this balm to basically anyone with skin
cream that lasts forever
it's not watery or thin
it just melts on my skin
your dollar not only heals you skin
burned skin wayyy beyond what any after-sun cream has ever done for me
t didn't peel or freckle like it normally does
so much so that i have put off my search for under eye concealer
a lot of eye creams don't do anything for me
this stuff is a miracle in a tube
it's hard to use retin-a around the eyes
doesn't crease at all after i set it with a powder
it doesn't leave my skin feeling sticky.
it's not too thick or greasy which i love because stuff like that causes me to break out
i feel like it does have a tiny bit of scent
it doesn't irritate my skin
everything irritates my skin
i still do get a bit of flakiness on my face
having everything irritate you
they feel really heavy or greasy on the skin
doesn't make skin greasy mid day
i must say first that #1 does have an unpleasant smell
just as dr perricone says he doesn't put any irritating scents in his products which is better for your skin
can't believe how smooth my skin has become
you will see your skin change
doesn't linger on the skin
helps clear breakouts the only problem is it stinks
i can't spend this much on moisturizer
it doesn't linger for long
please don't change the formula just cause of some people's complains on scent
it kind of lingers on your face
if you want something for moisture
i decided to try this anyway despite it saying it's for oily skin
it is not sticky or heavy at all
i would recommend this to anyone that has acne prone skin
i saw comments about how you shouldn't pull on your skin with an oil
it just feels slimey
if i am not careful, it can easily flake.
it's the only oil based product that hasn't also dried my skin
i don't know if this would be good for oily skin as it does add moisture
while it doesn't remove all makeup like it claims
it's my first time trying a gel to oil product
you know how if you wash your makeup off in the shower you walk out with raccoon eyes
even after you've felt like you've cleaned it all?
it doesn't irritate it or form new breakouts
this might be all you need to clean your face
clarisonic because i don't like to use the clarisonic when removing makeup
love the smell of the cleanser too.
it's a great wash for my morning routine!
need to use products that don't clog my pores
their moisturizing bomb cream that i had come to love wasn't quite heavy enough for me
this doesn't clog the pores
it takes hardly any product to cover both eyes
can't say this mask is completely the reason for my skins glow
what this mask does is clear out all the gunk in your pores
i think it's the gunk in my pores that have brought to the surface
clay masks do wonders for me
no smell, which i like, and no weird stickiness.
i find the other creams from the line can be a little to heavy on my skin
not greasy at all
the cleansing oil did not impress me.
i felt i had to apply too much pressure to clean off my mascara
i think i might try another one of their moisturizers
sits really well with my makeup doesn't look greasy
the way the cleansing oil melts everything off your face is amazing
couldn't seem to find anything to address oiliness
not greasy at all in my tzone
i find that this product easily gets rid of the majority of my makeup
it doesn't make my skin feel dried out nor greasy
i prefer that over abrasive exfoliators which can harm your skin
it's so easy to use
the cleansing oil i like to use when i'm feeling lazy
it doesn't leave a film after washing it off
it gets most of my makeup off
my face isn't left feeling like there's still an oil film on it
i recommend this to anyone scared of using oils to clean
it doesn't exfoliate enough to trouble shoot this
i would recommend the rice powder to anyone looking to refresh their skin that they're mostly happy with
i remind you it does have a brightening technique
the powder enzyme is super good after the oil there is actually a lotion as described on sephora online it's just all the way in side the gift box it's literally a sample comes in one of those pouch sample super small it's not in a jar
it's not going to foam
just an fyi if you have that "clean" feeling after a cleanse where your face feels taunt
true to the name its very gentle you can choose to wipe it off or wash it off
night time cleanser the mild scent of rose is there it doesn't linger or anything
it doesn't cause breakouts
yes the product does harden just like normal coconut oil
the fact that it's organic only makes it better
it's light on my skin and doesn't feel oily.
especially if you wear makeup daily.
i used it mostly for my crows feets
if you already have deep wrinkles or you're a particular age
it doesn't clog my pores.
it doesn't leave any oily residue at all
however not leave greasy residue
i can't feel any texture at all
the only problem i have is that it gets stuck in my beard because it is a hard area to moisturize
it's hydrating but not too heavy.
didn't want to splurge on a face cream that would over load my skin
it's prone to get flaky
i never thought i'd find a moisturizer that would hydrate my skin without breaking it out
it takes a minute to kick inbest for night moisturizer there's no perfume smell to it
does not feel sticky or greasy
for the rest of my face it doesn't make it look oily or anything
most people commenting are saying that "it gives a white cast" "it's so thick
yes it is thick
i don't rub it in.
t may harden more if left in it
it's too thick for under make up
you don't have to rub it in super hard
doesn't leave you with oily residue afterwards
it's so long lasting
flaky because i hadn't taken care of it while i was sick
i don't rub this in.
i think it's too thick to do that.
its crazy thick too
it doesn't clog pores or make me greasy
while it didn't irritate my skin
i even mix a little argan oil in
i didn't want to be coated in it
desparately searching for the one that would provide the perfect amount of moisture yet still not make me shiny/greasy or breakout
have not come across anything else that hydrates my skin like pure
it's ingredients are not bad either
since it's rather on the thicker side i use it at night after my serum
although it's pretty thick
was on the hunt for anti aging that didn't bug my poor eyes
it doesn't bug my eyes one bit.
glow-y my skin has been in the morning even when i use only this cream alone
sometimes clogged tzone skin loves this stuff
i think it's thick enough that you can put a little on
it's still not greasy
it doesn't break me out or make my oily skin even more oily
it's light weight on my face
i don't even have to use my primer
which really surprised me because it's a thick cream
it does have a bit of a tacky feel upon application
want to tame your wrinkles, try this cream asap!
it's a staple for me now!
doesn't make my skin break out
i so like the lack of chemicals.
it's too soon to tell if it's working on the anti-aging front
face is everything you want in a rich
it doesn't dull my skin.
while it seems counterintuitive to clean wil oil to battle oily skin
don't be afraid of it being an "oil" because my skin hates oils
this takes all my makeup off without irritating my skin
but it's super gentle somehow.
i honestly wear alot of makeup like layers on layers
it's really watery so a lot of it goes to waste when you try to pour it into your h
there is an oil you use then the soap.
if you follow this regimen you will not have flaky skin
thought it was going to be oily
it's hard to travel with a bar of soap
it does a decent job in melting off makeup
i don't like keeping soap bars near the sink so this is kind of my default "shower" facial cleanser
it really gets you squeaky clean used without the oil
i noticed that after using the soap of bar does not leave a wet mess
the only thing it can't get rid of which i underst
so afterwards i just use a eye makeup remover
that maybe the taste cannot be taken down because of the ingredients in it that cannot be substituted
make sure you use a generous amount of the cleansing oil as it directs because thats what helps it not strip your face when you combine the cleansing bar with it
i think it did well to cleanse my face
maybe the cleansing 'oil' by itself
the oil is not greasy
didn't lather enough with my fingers
as i like to remove my makeup entirely with a wipe
i do feel my skin is squeaky clean after i use
the "oil" is not really oily at all in my opinion
you can feel the little grains of something in there when you apply the bar of soap to your face so make sure you apply the bar directly to your skin
when you're done washing your face
like you can literally feel that your pores are clean
i also like the little container it's in.
it's stylish enough for me to put on my bathroom sink without feeling like it needs to be hidden
the only thing i don't like is that it is a little drying
i don't enjoy t as much in the outer areas of my skin
my skin so smooth that even my husb
so anything that helps cleanse my skin is a automatic plus for me
i actually use this in the shower
which i think causes less mess
it's more like a face wash than an oil
whenever i use this product i can defiantly tell a difference in my skin
i also really love that it's black because it's unlike any other facial cleanser i've used
it does get all your makeup off
sometimes i would forget to use it
i wasn't to sure how i felt about applying a cleansing oil being that my skin is super oily
thanks to influenster i was able to try this product on my post baby oily skin
i think the combo would work better for someone whose skin isn't as dry as mine is
this product line reminds me why i love oil cleansers so much
i can't say it's made any changes in the texture or acne scars i have
it has somewhere to drain if it's wet
having to use two different products to wash your face seems mundane
you do not need to use much of the cleansing oil to take off makeup
i usually stay away from facial soaps because they always strip my face of nature oil
didnt even feel like i needed any extra moisturizer after which i usually need to use after washing my face
i truly feel combining both cleansers gets rid of every trace of makeup
t doesn't get moldy
you don't have to worry about one of those plastic soap holders
y skin feel almost as if i've used a mask
t doesn't look like an eye sore
the black soap really seemed to help clear out my pores
okay so usually i don't brag about high end face wash
is really picky when it comes to washing
really deep cleans all that hard to remove stuff like eyeliner etc
the oil really feels like it draws out the impurities on your face
the soap afterwards makes your face feel literally squeaky clean
the cleansing oil isn't what you'd expect it to be which is non-oily
you don't need much to cleanse your face
luxurious especially when you're having a long day/week
it's not in a flimsy box
i usually never can go anywhere without makeup to hide my facial skin
i dont usually do well with charcoal products
i really liked the cleansing oil not so much the cleansing bar it kind of left my face dry
i would definitely recommend it to someone that doesn't like to use fancy face washes frequently or only does the soap
in pain that's how bad it is
it didn't irritate my skin at all
my only issue is that the gel gets into my eyes somehow
however it doesn't completely take off waterproof mascara
my only issue with this is the black soap lather makes a bit of a mess on my counter because i tend to splash stuff all over when i wash my face
it's more like a gel
i cannot wait to try the white marble bar that everyone is raving about
like i can't put moisturizer on fast enough.
it's a very cute size cleansing set
this doesn't irritate it at all
it doesn't make it worse like other cleansers
my skin doesn't feel dried out
it's smell isn't bad
because it is such a squeaky type of clean
the oil didn't over soak into my t-zone which is my problem area
since if you're not careful about letting it dry it can get a little funky
so you'll have to keep rinsing it
you can tell the oils are gone
it's not overly dried out
it isn't harsh on my face
i didn't experience any sensitivity or breakouts which is nice
it comes in that cute plastic tray you see there
it's a good cleansing set either way.
so you would need to find one to balance out your cleansing routine
the erno laszlo double cleanse is such a fool prof cleansing system you won't skip it
you'll be fine if a bit of moisturizer
i felt my face sting a bit but it's tolerable.
usually i am content if a facewash doesn't break out or dry out my skin
it is not irritating at all
i like it's deep clean effect.
around my nose is where it's really oily
this product completely cleans my face to the point where i can really here the squeaky clean noise
the soap bar is pretty ordinary
it doesn't give a tingling sensation or any sensation at all
it does seem to be evening my skin tone
if you care about scent
know that this has a lightweight-clean scent that doesn't linger
not even a little bit oily
this cleansing oil does not leave any residue
sn't a smell to this which is good for sensitive people or someone who doesn't like a scented face product
not oily like i thought it might
my only dislike was the bottle of oil is not pourer friendly
surprisingly doesn't break me out
not sure if the bars in the other sets smell like this or if it's just the hydra-therapy set
most times i fight that laziness
i especially enjoy using the cleansing oil because it removes all of my eye makeup without any harsh rubbing
i feel like rubbing it directly on your face isn't very sanitary
the soap bar left my skin feeling a little 'squeaky' as most bar soaps do
i still can't get over how soft my skin feels after using this
i don't like the packaging of the oil because you have to be careful that it doesn't spill out
it easily takes all my mascara
in fact i see less pores
not only did this product not clog my pores
i don't smell anything from soap
even though it is an oil based product it did not leave me feeling oily or greasy
not dried out like lots of other cleansers tend to do
suddenly find youself needing something less stripping?
this might not be hydrating enough for you
was excited to try it because i often find gel or foam cleansers too stripping
they completely cleared my skin in without making me too oily or too clean
the cleansing oil is rather hard to rinse off.
it does not leave the skin oily
i don't want to make it too oily
can't wait to see the long term effects it has on my winter skin
many of the other products i used in the past did a good job in hydrating my skin yet this is combo left my sking feeling soft
i think they're clunky
or maybe even a dropper
what makes this set great is not only the hydration you get from the oil cleansers
this set is not drying which you might expect from a cleansing bar
my skin isn't so oily anymore
i wear a lot of makeup
it wasn't too heavy
didn't leave an oil texture to my skin
new products sometimes dry my face out or even make my t-zone more oily
i didn't even use a moisturizer
it doesn't dry your face out which is nice
lets just say.. the soap smells amazing.
i almost felt like moisturizer wasn't needed after using this wash
i do love the packaging with the little soap holder though
as it gets all of your makeup off
the cleansing oil is amazing it really breaks down all the makeup
i assume it is because it's a cleansing oil that breaks up things inside of pores
so smooth it didn't leave an oily or dry feeling to my skin which i love it also gave my skin such a beautiful
i am always a bit skeptical when it comes to trying new cleansers on my face because it usually leaves my skin too oily or too dry
ultimately i loved the fact that my face did not have an oily or dry finish
my skin looks dewy, can't explain.
don't wash the oil off people read the siresctions
this stuff actually made my skin less prone to breaking out
it doesn't cause breakouts
t doesn't have to touch dirty hotel sinks/showers
it's usually harder to get the cleansing product off
more impressive was the fact that my face didn't feel oily or dried out
i mean all even lash glue
don't really feel like i need a toner
i really like the smell and the lather <3
as it's easy to over-pour
that's the secret to getting all that junk off your face
this product doesn't dry my skin out however i wish it felt like a deeper clean
doesn't make my skin feel dry or irritated after removing makeup
it melts away makeup so easily
doesn't leave greasy feeling on my eye
the cleansing bar doesn't make my face feel itchy
let it be moisturizer or make up
this was packaged so cute.
i feel that it gets my skin cleaner than just soap alone
see if it works for your skin
since i got this in my inlufenster box i can't stop using it this cleanser has become a staple in my skin care routine
does not leave my skin tight
my only problem is that the soap does not create a lather
it melts away even waterproof mascara in no time.
the oil removes all makeup when i didn't have any makeup remover
yet my skin wasn't oily either
i also love how clean it makes my face feel not to mention having 2 products that deep clean all the unnecessary stuff on your face is a plus
'm always worried oils will clog my pores
i always felt i was oily or still dirty afterward
doesn't get oily throughout the day
my only issue is that it does not remove my even my non-waterproof eye makeup very well
it does not have a super perfume-y smell.
there's no other facial cleanser that can clean my face as well without drying it out
it didn't leave my face oily at all
it's difficult to pour and not make a mess with.
i tend to wear a good amount of makeup
with this it's all gone
i will say it's a little hard to clean some areas of your face using the bar directly
especially if you're traveling or don't typically use bar soaps
i also love the luxe tray they include so you can keep your bar clean
even my eye makeup
when i was done even before using the serum my face did not feel drying at all
the only thing i dislike is it being in a soap bar form as i don't always go to grab this kind of product
just makes my makeup go on more smooth without making me look oily
it doesn't change how well the cleansing bar works
when a product doesn't break my skin out
my skin didn't feel dried out after using this set
rubbing the bar directly on my face didn't produce much lather
my skin isn't so oily anymore
it's my first time ever trying a bar of soap as a cleansing duo with oil
or like i'm not getting all the residue off my face
the oil is great for sensitive skin since there's no added fragrance or anything
my face actually feels squeaky clean after using the bar
it balances my combo skin and doesn't strip it.
i got the sensitive which i wasn't sure how it would act with my dry skin
i started to notice less black head on my nose even though it's not exfoliating
a lot of products cause my skin to break out
it definitely cleared my pores of any makeup.
it's not greasy at all!
my face doesn't feel as clean if my second step doesn't lather up
irritation becuase my complexion looks nicer
this cleansing duo did not irritate my skin one bit
it doesn't irratates my skin at all
plus the packaging is really pretty in plastic "drawer" that you can use to store your cleansing duo
this baby does no harm to my skin
think it's an effective mask
the application is a bit inconvenient as you have to scoop out the poeder
it doesn't sting or irritate my skin
i actually hope origins doesn't add some nasty chemicals to make this smell better
i usually use these tea masks about x3 a week
i don't do masks often anymore
it was a bit irritating the moment i applied it on the skin
the cream which is not a thick cream btw absorbs you don't even need that much
i've tried a ton of eye creams since i am very paranoid about the fine lines under my eyes
i love how this cream doesn't just sit on the skin as i find most creams tend to do for me
it's not heavy like most eye creams are!
it just melts into your skin.
it's so soft to put on and you barely need any.
sometimes eye bags that will pop out when i'm tired
i often feel creams don't really go deep to truly moisturize
i don't have dark circles or deep lines
it's not greasy at all
it doesn't burn my eyes
i wasn't sure about getting this eye cream bc i've been burned before on expensive creams
it's not greasy and i use it under my makeup.
basically just really bad skin due to excessive eye scratching from allergies
this face wash is the only one i'll ever use because it's the only one that makes me feel hydrated
i've never had a bad reaction to it as i usually do with other face washes
is not at all foamy
many cleanser claim to not leave your skin feeling tight
doesn't have that 'too tight' feeling that most cleansers leave you with
i like the glass dropper it comes with too
i don't really have wrinkles to begin with
it's definitely on the pricey side
it's definitely not watery but not sticky either.
it's a thicker liquid which i was afraid would leave oily residue
maybe messing with my concealer
it's not thick/heavy at all like other treatments i've tried + my skin feels so smooth
imagine if you needed something after a peel or just skin reddens
ps... did not clog my pores.
didn't get a burning sensation
i also makes my lips feel like heaven when i use it as an overnight treatment
i never give reviews mostly because i'm super lazy
this doesn't get rid of my eczema
it is a bit greasy
i tend to be a little absentminded at times
yes there is a lot of glitter
i rarely break out
oils weren't cutting it anymore
it's also great for chapped hands!
you don't have to feel greasy during the day
i've even put it on breakouts
it's too thick for my taste without mixing it into other skin care
the only thing is that it smells like straight up honey
it's not bad it kind of fades away fast
i'd definitely say this is an ointment versus any kind of h
this stuff is good for nighttime use only
i personally don't find it repulsive or overwhelming
it has really smoothed it out without irritating it like a lot of other moisturizers
it doesn't break my temperamental skin out
my lips occasionally get really bad
there is not much of a smell other than a mild honey smell
just like you wouldn't use an eye ointment during the day
why most people are complaining about the shimmer in the lotion because if you don't overdo it
which i do sometimes
it will leave your face looking really sticky
you're going to want to slather it everywhere
i hardly ever get acne
don't feel a huge need to use eye cream when i pay this into my undereye
i don't even have to wear mascara most days anymore
it's such a winter skin saver.
gets the balm everywhere
sometimes i can't help popping a pimple
it doesn't seem to clog my pores
plus it's also great for chapped lips
i can't recommend it enough as an ingredient
i can't imagine paying full price just for lips
it doesn't drip off the face or anything.
this wouldn't provide enough moisture for me
it does have actual glitter in it
i don't think it would be super flattering all over the face
sometimes it starts looking more oily than glowy on my face
it's subtle enough when used sparingly for everyday
no breakouts, just the right amount of shimmer.
it would be too much shine if your complexion is naturally "dewy
you'll look like a glazed donut if you do
seemed to even out skintone
i would not use this as an all-over-face moisturizer
i wouldn't even recommend mixing this with your normal moisturizer for that "glow from within" look
as a moisturizer it's not bad
doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy or oily or anything like that
the fact that it's supposed to be "sweat-proof"
don't want my skin to look dull
love using it as a highlighter for days when i don't want a full face
it's just a bit too glittery for that.
would only suggest this if you are putting this on to wear under makeup or if you will only be wearing this indoors mostly or just on cheeks
i don't agree with those saying you need foundation over it because it's too sparkly
i combine this with a foundation that is just too thick for me
i feel like it is too drying to actually be used as a moisturizer
i liked to use this as an actual liquid highlighter on no makeup look days because it does soak into your skin
the glittery component of this moisturizer is so small that it doesn't look like glitter
try it out for yourself
makes your skin look dewy but not too oily.
i didn't experience the high glitter disco ball effect described in other reviews
which doesn't prevent flakes
if you want to look like the tin man i would use it as a primer
if you aren't into shimmer lotions then of course it would probably seem like excess sparkle
i am so confused as to why so many people are saying that it's covering their faces in glitter?
by end of my work day i usually feel grimy
like i need to wash my face
it definitely didn't stop me from looking oily
i look like i need to blot my face rather than just wash it
i don't feel as greasy
it is not glitter chunk filled like some reviewers have suggested
on its own it's intense
all the comments about how this product is too glittery
i wouldn't use glittery to describe it
i wouldn't suggest rubbing it all over your face
others say it's just the perfect amount of sheen
there's nothing wrong with the product it just works form some skin tones
this takes my boring matte skin
this didn't make me an oil slick within 15 minutes of applying
as far as the glitter goes yes there is glitter in it
under a full coverage foundation you can't tell it has glitter at all
not too glittery in my opinion
definitely not for the face because it'll look way too shimmery
it's also not got glitter chunks in it.
i don't wear it under or over makeup.
it's a decent, non-greasy cream.
haven't tried it with makeup
it does not have lose gritty glitter
nor any glitter whatsoever
my face is not glittery nor shiny or anything weird
not to wear i will be oily
some say it has chunks of glitter
to see some reviews that say the "glitter" won't wash off or you'll look like a disco ball etc
sounds absurd like they're talking about a different product or have to have completely matte looking skin
anyway, it's not a heavy moisturizer at all.
feel like it blurs imperfections a little
it does nothing bad to my skin
it's not so much as a glitter
and then some of the new mascara and that's it.
i don't like the price of this cream :o
i could deal without the glitter
don't get much sleep
my eyes suffer from dark circles as i hardly get any sleep
doesn't irritate my skin at all
even though it's balmy it sinks into the skin quickly
t doesn't interfere with your makeup in the morning
the product almost seems to melt from a cream to almost an oil after you've applied it to your face
it's actually the first eye cream i've used
i don't really use eye creams.
i usually go straight for concealer or eye base.
my eye makeup doesn't ware off as easy either which is good
it doesn't feel tacky when putting it on.
it dries really quick
doesn't have a sticky texture
i can't get enough of how quickly this eye cream moisturizes
let's face it- in order to really attain puff less under eyes you have to drink a lot of water
i wouldn't recommend putting it on before eye makeup because it can cause it to crease
it doesn't irritate at all.
i don't normally wear eye balm
let me tell you it's amazing for dark puff eyes
it really does take away puffiness
didn't make my concealer glide off during the day
it's also hydrating which is exactly what i need in an eye cream
didn't make me feel greasy.
i don't find that it makes undereye foundation
can't be sure about fines lines or wrinkles.
i don't have fine lines or wrinkles
it didn't feel too silicone-y also which was a plus
there were small shimmer specs in the formula which didn't bother me since i applied concealer
not too much for my oily skin
it also doesn't break my skin out
not sticky like the original
does not make my skin feel or appear oily
it's by no means "heavy
it's still a good moisturizer no doubt
it doesn't feels greasy on your skin
it doesn't give me breakouts
this stuff is lovely to tighten up that less elastic bit
thick enough so you don't have to use a lot of product
while i don't have many wrinkles
names the product while telling you "it's knocking the crud outta the wrinkles under your eyes"
also making sure i don't look oily
it's not really moisturizer
usually a few samples aren't enough to see real results
yes both were spendy
it's plumps out even deep wrinkles after 1 use!
i don't recall a lingering or odd smell
doesn't close pores or make me break out
i don't really have wrinkles
wrinkles isn't necessarily my problem
when i want to do some anti-aging
you'll see the before
otherwise your skin feels tacky
it's a little out of my price range
not greasy at all.
the smell like others say is not that pungent.
it's tacky at first
if it remains sticky or affects makeup application perhaps you've used too much
the efficacy is such that i don't care what it smells like
if it is a little tacky
this doesn't have unnecessary
if you use the right amount of it your face won't be sticky
it smells like it's active
it gives you a nice "glow" if you just use it plus some moisturizer on no makeup days
i don't have many wrinkles
it smells a little vinegar-y but nothing too bad.
my skin alone feels so plump
i would say it minimizes redness too
i do not use this "primer" as a primer.
it doesn't make my makeup last
didn't notice any blurring of pores either.
has no harsh perfumes or anything to irritate
made me oily as heck
so this being a plus that i don't need to apply moisturizer before my primer
i like for when i'm not wearing makeup.
it's so light on my face and hydrates so well.
i like to wear it under my primer
i like that it doesn't feel sticky
it really melts into your skin
t doesn't look shiny or cause my makeup to slip around throughout the day
even w no other makeup
i don't see the glow anymore
i do look a bit crazy shiny right after applying it
wouldn't recommend it as a daily moisturizer of you're not going to cover it with foundation
it's light enough that you don't feel like you're wearing a primer
i love using this when i don't want to wear makeup
i put this on when i don't want super matte that day
i will say that if you're oily
i wouldn't put it on your nose if you want an all over matte look
i can't think of better words besides healthy glow
only because i was reeeaally hoping it would smell like coconut
it doesn't smell bad
just doesn't smell like coconut to me
how refreshing to flip over a container at sephora
i don't even use another primer with this
perfect for those days when i don't want to apply makeup
it's perfect for the summer because i can skip my regular moisturizer
doesn't make me oily at all
i don't notice any strong smells
it doesn't smell like coconuts
not too watery either
i don't know what the reviews are about shimmer
no shimmer at all even when it's wet
it's light and my skin drinks it up.
it doesn't make me oily
you don't need too much to look like a glowing goddess
only thing it's missing is spf
although if you're not into scented products or coconut then you'll hate it
when i wear matte foundation it does not take away any of the matte finish
it's too hot to layer products
not too strong like some moisturizers that can give u a headache
doesn't clog my pores take a minor miracle
it wouldn't be heavy enough for winter for me
gets rid of most of my pores
this is gentle enough that it doesn't disturb the oily skin or the dry skin
doesn't cause breakouts like most primers
it's not a primer like a smash box which "blurs pores" or whatever
it's also not greasy and gross overtime.
i only lightly pat
don't put too much cause it'll make you look like a disco ball
not dried onto your skin if that makes sense
so weird because this isn't supposed to be a pore filling or minimizing primer
my only con with this primer is that my makeup doesn't last as long
i'd say it's a combo of those two things plus smoothed my skin
pores if i don't use a primer
especially if you have oily skin or have trouble getting your makeup to last all day
even under foundation it makes your skin look glowy
i will say that i still need to use a different primer on my oily spot
not greasy all day
lightly everywhere else since im more oily in those areas
didn't feel heavy at all
this isn't a pore-filling primer nor is it a super rich moisturizer
even though this hydrates it's exactly what my skin needs
doesn't make me look greasy at all
it doesn't pull the weight a st
i wouldn't use it by itself or with a more dewy foundation unless i wanted to look sweaty
however, it did not blur my pores.
for makeup i don't see that it helps keep it on at all
i notice my makeup
i didn't have an issue with being extra shiny
i don't know if you had oily skin type you would enjoy this primer
it doesn't leave a slick greasy kind of feeling on the face
it does not make me oily
not greasy or heavy feeling.
after applying this primer my skin looks so glowy
it seems to stop my t-zone from getting excessively oily like it usually does
i've never used a really heavy duty primer
sometimes i do notice a few white patches on my forehead where i didn't pat the product in completely
doesn't get patchy or flaky
like real coconuts- not the fake smell
fill your pores then this doesn't really do that
i actually used this as a primer instead of just a moisturizer because i ran out of my normal primer
reading into it there is actually no artificial fragrance which is amazing
i did notice some white residue-like stuff on the edges of my face where the product ends
i don't wear a lot of make-up most weekdays
no matter how much i exfoliate
if you are sick of your foundation being uneven or flaky
the only drawback is that my nose tends to get a bit oily
my skin looks flawless all i have to put on is blush
magically my skin looks so flawless even after 8 hours
i don't like the smell because i don't like coconut
it's also fantastic for using a q-tip to remove stray flakes of mascara or liner dust because it doesn't require rinsing
doesn't seem to leave a film on your skin
it only takes a couple swipes of this stuff to take off even the peskiest of waterproof eyeliners
my face actually breaks out more if i use soap
it did leave my skin a tad bit sticky
so a little will go a long way on your makeup pad or cloth
i am lazy about my skin care routine
literally the only thing that takes off my mascara without burning my eyes or irritating them
it's not the best at taking off very heavy makeup
i normally use this in the morning to refresh because if i wash my face too much it gets irritated
don't have to put on makeup
i like this well enough for removing makeup
i do find with mascara i have to hold
this does leave a little bit of tackiness after use
i don't wear too much makeup
doesn't irritate my skin
i can see all the dirt
i can't believe how easily it takes off makeup!
took the makeup off without me having to rub too much which i have to do sometimes with some cleansers
doesn't leave a greasy residue or make my face shine too much
i like to remove my makeup
love that you don't have to rinse it off
it's a pretty good moisturizer i have combination skin if you have dry skin i would say you would still have to apply something els after this al
i am lazy when it comes to face washing
i could swear it is helping my skin condition
as some have mentioned that it's unpleasant
i don't even *have* to use moisturizer afterwards
if something says coconut
it's thick enough that i can apply it to my face then use my magic eraser cloth to wash my face at night
this doesn't sting eyes
if it's a bit stubborn i just add a drop of caudalie's makeup remover to my eyes as i love that stuff for eye makeup
i don't need to rub to get the makeup off like i do with makeup wipes
mpressed because every other remover makes me red
it removed my waterproof mascara without a problem it removed all my makeup with very little effort
this will remove even stubborn mascara with the use of one more application
you can't beat the benefits of charcoal
do not leave a sticky film at all
it will even remove makeup
it says its a no rinse formula however i definitly think you should rinse
i don't know if it helps my acne.
it does get rid of all my makeup
it helps get rid of my acne
practically gets rid of my pores
i got rose because i wasn't sure about the others with exfoliants
not hard to wash off
not irritating and gets the job done.
it doesn't produce any suds
it takes your makeup off easily
just make sure you have a tissue or cloth to wipe it off
otherwise youre just smearing old makeup around your face
works like a charm and doesn't dry my face out.
it does a great job of removing makeup without stripping your skin of all its oils nor does it leave a greasy residue
i do not know if it helps with smoothing out lines or wrinkles
it does seem to smooth
the bottle will last forever it's the only thing i've tried that actually minimizes my pores
i can't stop touching my smooth baby butt face .
i don't really use primer on my face
it's not like that's all you're smelling all day
it's an expensive primer
i find myself using less makeup
my face doesn't look glowy at all in real life
it does look glowy through camera
it doesn't seem to make me more oily
it actually gives a "your skin
even outs your skin tone
it has a slight scent that i can't describe
it's not bothersome at all
if you too are a tomato face
all the stuff you do that make you look yucky post-flight
i don't know how to use concealers or or foundations
my face gets red for no reason sometimes
sometimes trying several in a day or trying just one that doesn't agree super irritates my skin
i even use it as soot treatment just where i need
my skin color is even
i didn't even need to apply my foundation powder to hide all the usual redness
sometimes acne pops out
keeps flakiness down to a minimum while not exaggerating any oily areas at all
i actually have pretty oily skin
i don't need to use a lot of the cream
or just plain useless
i like to wear this one on my no makeup days
it does leave a sticky feeling
doesn't leave my skin greasy looking
i can't use day cream because it is too heavy
silicone is not something my skin likes
my makeup lasts all day
often avoid moisturizers because they feel heavy on my skin
this doesn't have as much moisture as i need
the application becomes tacky so using my beauty blender for foundation helps
i don't actually use this moisturizer to prime my skin
not slippery like some silicone primers can feel
so anything can break out my skin or give me rosacea
it is a little tacky which normally i would hate
the smell is so annoying
i am allergic to a lot of makeup but not this.
no reaction at all except soaking in all the goodness
i usually use just a silicone based primer under my eyes
if you conceal or "bake" heavily you will definitely love this product
after you use this product your face feels sort of sticky
just be sure to let it sink in otherwise it pills slightly
i do like the ingredients
however, it's not a good primer under makeup.
i find my makeup lasts all day
i also notice that my makeup doesn't crease throughout the day
i wanna love it i just don't no if i can get passed the strong smell of it i can deal with a fragrance smell in my beauty routine
this is all i can smell all day
it's a weird nasty odor i hope i can get passed it
i still get weird flaky patches
or just when i want to feel extra pampered with firm
is that they had a highlighter that looked the way this looks when you dispense it into your h
i don't have a lot of wrinkles for this to smooth out
is very hard for me to find a moisturizer that when i put it on at night i won't wake up oily
it doesn't leave me oily or causes breakouts
not greasy or heavy.
a little goes a long way so there's no need to slather this all over
it doesn't make my milia worse.
it doesn't leave a weird smell or texture
doesn't have a strong smell
i gave it four stars instead of 5 because i prefer a bit less of a glow from my moisturizer
my skin looks nice enough after using this i sometimes go without foundation if i'm wearing minimal makeup that day
although it's a really intense moisture it never clogged my pores
this one just goes on so lightly
t doesn't leave any kind of film or shine on my face
it's a good moisturizer too.
does not feel greasy or sticky after applying
now it's not hydrating for 24 hours like they claim
it doesn't have that typical sticky moisturizer feel
it doesn't increase oil
this is the only moisturizer i've tried that doesn't really increase oil
doesn't take forever to dry
i don't like how thin
other than that it's fine
most face moisturizers break me out in some way or another
have a hard finding a morning moisturizer that won't make my face look greasy
application goes on a little slimy feeling then the skin instantly absorbs it
after trying to find something that doesn't leave my skin oily
sticky creams -- i had no idea they could be so light
it doesn't irritate my oily
i don't like it for everyday since it doesn't have spf
didn't bother my sensitive skin
struggle finding a moisturizer that doesn't irritate my skin
it almost like it holds my makeup too
it's been helping my face that's still so cracked
find some moisturizers can make my skin look really shiny/greasy when applied under makeup
does not feel heavy
that's such a refreshing thing to find
i just hate that oily feeling
doesn't leave a greasy feel
definitely worth a try if you have naturally oily skin that tends to get dry in weird areas
not in a greasy way
doesn't have an offensive smell
it feels almost water-like as you apply it to your skin
does not leave you oily looking on your t-zone
it wasn't greasy at all
even though this doesn't have specific mattifying claims
this stuff is pricey
it doesn't burn at all.
it didn't irritate my skin at all
this doesn't leave my skin oily
since i have been using this i haven't woke up oily i just feel soft
this not only doesn't make the oily areas of my skin oilier
it's a very light formula that doesn't clog my pores
i don't think i'll be changing from this moisturizer for a while
it doesn't clog my pores or cause any break outs.
box, and it's not bad.
i can't say that my face stayed moisturizer for 12 hours
this didn't make my face oily
if you're a low key kinda girl who just needs redness
i don't think i would recommend this for oily skin though
it helps even out my skin tone
i don't have a problem with it being too dark or causing any lines
it doesn't drag on the skin like other sticks
i wanted a product which would give my skin a dewy look
since my skin doesn't have many blemishes
all i have to do is buff this out
plus it doesn't oxidize on my face later in the day
it's a bit dark even for me
i would probably not recommend this unless you use it for contouring or you have a dark tan
i prefer to use it for non-makeup days for a little glow
it doesn't feel dry actually the opposite.
f you're oily then you'd benefit from using their pores no more pore refiner primer either 1st or in place of
doesn't crease, and nice to have spf.
it does look dark when it goes on
i can't wait to use this in the summer with the spf
also not prone to ball up like some blur type products or primers
it's too dark for my ginger skin
it's so blendable and easy to use.
makes my skin look smooth, even and not greasy.
i normally hate spf for the smell
this doesn't have that normal spf feel or smell
i usually never get acne
this stuff is ridiculously mattifying
especially good for combination oily skin because you can select exactly where you want to put it on your face
it doesn't make sense over makeup.
it's also perfect for those bathroom breaks when you're bar hopping
if you aren't a fan of the extra steps: skin care regimen
that doesn't seem to work as well as when applying it over makeup
when i do apply over my makeup it makes my foundation look sort of "muddy"
it does keep it quite matte though!
i don't always like blotting with powder because i don't like being totally matte or powdery looking
this stuff absorbs oil with just a few blots
i blot a little on my t-zone area after my makeup is done
i don't like to apply it over makeup as i feel it takes away some coverage
i feel like it's not super sanitary to keep having to blot the oil
my face is usually a big oily mess less than an hour after i put on my makeup
it's not even bad enough for me to grab a blotting sheet or apply more of this
no matter what time of year, it's always oily.
not one mattifyjng primer or setting powder stops it from getting oily
i don't have to blot once.
it doesn't remove my makeup
this is the only product that works for my super oily skin
it's less messy than products from other lines
so as not to remove the makeup
doesn't come out pink
of course a little pigment ends up on the applicator it does not disrupt or change the way my makeup what so ever
it's definitely a must if you have somewhat oily skin or want to tone down a foundation that has too much shine
this works wonders for my insanely oily skin.
it's such a minimal amount that it doesn't make a difference to the look of the foundation
i usually put it on before my primer
i don't even care that this is on the pricier side because it's the only thing i've found that keeps me entirely matte
really does keep you mostly matte all day!
my makeup didn't smear or anything--it was like it was new again
i do see my makeup come off on the sponge
i could feel it's made out of cheap plastic
wouldn't recommend putting it over makeup.
i recommend this to any one who gets oily during the day
my t zone will still gets shiny
helps me getting rid of the shines without looking cakey like the powder does
i don't need to blot for hours
that's as greasy as it got
just like many other oily girls i've tried it all
i will say it makes you very matte so maybe using a moisturizer that is light
in pictures it's the only thing that shines
my oily t zone is so bad
i don't wear heavy foundation
didn't remove any of my makeup underneath
blotting sheets don't quite do the job
i think it's even more matte than when i first applied my matte foundation
if you are oily, you need this!
it keeps me matte without giving any white cast to my face like most primers do
throughout the day i can literally wipe off my makeup i get so oily
it does kind of remove my makeup a little bit
my skin looks like i could fry something on it
my skin looks just as matte as it was when i applied it
there's nothing worse then touching my face
you can't press too hard into the cushion.
maybe it is the moisture in the air i dont know
doesn't take my foundation off
this mask is everything!
especially if you want instant gratification (:
this mask is everything!
i can't use just about every product i try without breaking out into terrible acne around my mouth
always found perricone face wash formulas to be lacking
it removes all my makeup even my heavy eyeliner
yet is absorbed miraculously fast so you don't feel greasy
rather it's on your face
it does seem to sit on my skin
i wouldn't recommend for someone who has very oily skin
since it's very annoying to travel with both a moisturizer
which often happens to me while i travel
you can't really wear it on its own because it looks really shiny on the skin
it's not that it's greasy
didn't leave a sticky or heavy feel
it does feel like regular cheap cream with spf
not much of a smell, but the jar is so cute!
s down this product gives your skin so much moisture
i won't have to worry about that nasty sunscreen feel on
it's a thick texture which makes me feel like it's doing its job
it is not too greasy
when i took it home it wasn't as effective probably because i'm super lazy
the texture is light enough to wear under makeup
my skin was acting up something awful outta nowhere
tend to mess everything up when you stop
then i can go back to my usual favorite cleanser once it's done it's job
see when you mix water you can decide whether to make it a scrub-like cleanser or a soapy
even my skin tone
the powder can get a bit messy
the don't think the charcoal mask helped at all
many of them actually seem to inflame my skin even if they claim to be gentle
i don't scrub hard hence making the acne worse
it doesn't have any fake scents
my skin is really stubborn
with every cleanser i use it either doesn't work at all or works
it doesn't get rid of blackheads ://
i love the value of it since you only need a bit of powder to get a good amount of suds
i do not think this is an exfoliator
yet gets stubborn acne
i wash my face in the shower because it's easier
if i want to use it as an exfoliator i just add a tiny bit of water
or if i want it as a cleanser
if you use an oil or a heavy moisterizer then it's fine for dryer combo skin types like mine
i like the way it foams up too.
however, this stuff smells like vomit.
i like that i can control how gritty it is.
i don't have to worry about it going bad as i rotate through several different scrubs
while it doesn't have warming properties like the boscia cleanser does
it cleans your face without irritating it
the only con is it's a bit messy
it's so travel friendly since it's a powder
the powder can make your sink a little messy
i love the little spatula that comes with it
messy it's impossible to get off my face
if it gets in my hair
you know your skin
it doesn't leave my skin greasy or sticky.
get a sample of it and try it it's mind blowing!
i find that they're generally hyped up
it doesn't like oily products
it's not as thin
it's fun to use with the little pearls that you have to crush
it's fun popping all the little capsule things as you massage it in your skin
you really do need to massage it in for a while in order for it to change into the dark chocolate color
doesn't help remove the dead skin
this stuff is magic in a bottle!!!
i did not have any breakouts or redness.
i travel occasionally for work
t's hard to find a mask that doesn't burn or make my skin red afterwards
want a little pampering once a week buy this
if there's one thing on your counter you're going to splurge on
never had any fillers
do not get this in your mouth when you're washing it off
sweet i can't even explain just don't get it in your mouth please oh
i usually have combo skin
you'll see your skintone
or as often as you can tolerate depending on your skin
i don't break out as often now that this is part of my routine
it's expensive but it lasts ages.
if you've ever had a glycolic facial you know it won't last long
in front of the refrigerator while it's working it's magic on your skin
now it's just another day in skin paradise
mind you he's white
i barely wear makeup like i use to
my skin is literally glowing not even joking
doesn't feel excessive at all
it is kind to your skin
or it could burn you
i enjoy the sensation-- it's not so uncomfortable
it actually looks better than when i get an hour facial at a spa believe it or not
or don't get enough sleep or drink enough water
it does sting or burn a little when i first apply it
you can't put a price on your face
the actual burn the peel produces is really not bad at all
doesn't leave my face feeling weird when i take it off
it works amazing even though it's a little drying
i usually fan my face for a bit
my skin doesn't look dull anymore
the name on it "baby facial" because it really gives you baby skin
this mask just does my face justice
no matter how much i exfoliate it doesn't help
it's never been super bad
they just stay as tiny light red bumps which annoy me
it doesn't really tingle for me
this made it completely flatten/disappear because i can no longer see them anymore
the fact that it's a "mask
apply a thinner layer than you think you need
i just can't stop touching my face
i can tell that this literally unclogges my pores instantly
i tend to get red
i noticed that the mask did make my skin burn just a bit
my makeup goes on so smooth.
when i first put it on it burns soo stinkin bad that i want to wash it off immediately
i can't believe the difference in my pore size
it does sting a bit on application
when i say i'm addicted to skin care it's an understatement
let your skin do it's thing overnight
even better as you'll wake up with glowy baby soft skin that is even more beautiful after a good nights sleep soaking in a ton of marula oil
it goes on a bit tacky
the mask did burn a bit
whereas the results of other masks or aha/bha products didn't last long after the facial
witch is the problem i have with all cleansers it seems
this did tingle when applied
i typically avoid foaming cleansers because they're drying
just don't get it in your eyes
can't imagine using a different product
it is the only moisturizer that can really hydrate my skin regardless if it's summer or winter
a all year-round moisturizer for any type of skin that would not cause breakouts
does not cause my primer to pill
i hate moisturizer because it makes my face feel sticky
this is the best moisturizer i have ever used because it doesn't leave my face feeling sticky or oily
it's not sticky if you mix gel
doesn't make you oily
hope in a jar is what i usually use
it's different because it's a little bit of both worlds a gel
okay let's start off
on days that i don't wear makeup my friends
even though it's not listed to control blemishes
it dries down quickly and doesn't feel greasy.
as i found i wasn't getting an even consistency of cream/gel when i'd scoop
not for mornings when i wear makeup
is not oily feeling at all
it's like no other moisturizer i've used
this doesn't irritate me
finally found a daily moisturizer that's not too thick
not too gel like
it comes with a little spoon which i love for sanitary purposes
it absorbs into my skin so nicely it's a one
don't care for the smell
rating this product 5 stars because it still does everything it promises for your skin
i love that it's so pure in it's ingredients/process
additives that don't do your skin any favors
i can start wearing foundation without it looking cakey or go oh natural
it's not possible to go to bed without lathering my face in this stuff now
doesn't clog your pores or make you break out
it's a must have to your daily regimen!
it's even toned, no breakouts!!
i find i don't need a moisturizer to finish it off
i'd bathe in this stuff if i could
i don't use it on my face
the smell fades quickly so don't worry if you don't like the scent
not oily which i really love
you use only 2 or 3 drops for your face
not at all greasy
i cannot seem to find a way to apply it nicely
i don't want to use a cosmetic sponge because it will absorb too much of the oil
i sometimes use it on its own if my skin is really thirsty
no breakouts or anything.
first, the scent doesn't bother me.
subsides so who cares
not greasy at all.
i feel like it's a little thicker than the regular stuff
i don't mind scents as long as the product works.
it does not make me more oily
at first i was surprised with how thick it is because it's marketed as a day
i could see how some may not like as thick or luxurious of a texture
plus it doesn't leave that sticky filmy feeling on my h
it's very thick, so i only use it at night.
would never put it under makeup bc it does appear a bit oily before it soaks in
doesn't leave my skin feeling weird
my skin is even
you have to let the cream sink into your skin
i don't experience any burning
i literally cannot believe how quickly it started to not only moisturizer my skin
i would say that this moisturizer is probably best suited for more oily skin types that don't need as much hydration
so far, the this moisturizer is heaven in a jar.
this product doesn't leave my skin oily
almost feels like a primer on the skin
it didn't make it oily throughout the day
light enough for under makeup
this doesn't pill up under my makeup when i use it in the morning
because it tends to clog up
sometimes i just use it as an undereye cream
i would recommend onlyusing if you have dry/ combination skin regardless that the bottle says it is for all skin types because i could see it being too much for someone with oily skin
when it dries up your face doesn't feel tacky it feels soft
isn't greasy in the least
which i love since it's so expensive
if you like a rich
this is so thick i love it.
i won't get tired of this smell
its legit like a cloud of cream that smells like orange heaven whipped up to take your skin to another level of bliss
it's true this is a heavier cream
rinse off in the morning your skin will look even
i don't tend to wear it during the day
but, it almost has a honey like consistency.
because touching sticky things/getting sticky stuff on my clothes/eating sticky stuff is literally one of my biggest pet peeves
not sure if those with acne prone skin should use this
doesn't clog my pores at all like some others have reviewed
my skin will freak out on me
making sure to rub it in until it's totally absorbed because it is really thick
it is not greasy and absorbs.
i don't find it as thick as other reviewers
just the occasional period pimple so this moisturizer works well for me
it doesn't seem to absorb quick enough for makeup application
not greasy, works well am and pm!
i typically have really oily skin
not greasy in the least
which i found out is bad
i usually pat some juno oil on top of it
it is not only hydrate that moments when i just applied
oily skin may not love it that much.
the scent is not bad
those will always be oily
the only thing i don't like is how thick this product is
i do love that my makeup doesn't settle into my fine lines
tidal doesn't do anything for me in the winter
it's sinks in pretty fast.
does not leave residue
i don't notice the scent once i've applied it
t may not work for those who tend to be on the oily side
no perfume was added to mask an unpleasant scent so why start now?
i always always always end up with stubborn blemishes that lingered forever anytime i used anything with vitamin c
and not as oily as usua in the t zonel.
not greasy at all
even my skin tone
this doesn't leave me greasy
i typically get headaches from heavily scented products so this was just right for me
it doesn't break out the oily
doesn't clog my pores
you don't need slather it on your face
not irritating in the least
my skin literally looks like it's glowing after applied
finally something that doesn't irritate my skin or dry me out
i've even got a bit of glow going on!
just be careful because it's runny
tends to run though your fingers easily before it gets on your face
i wear a lot of makeup
also doesn't clog my sink drain which i never knew could be an issue until i tried the lancôme cleansing oil
not irritating to even broken
that it's cruelty free :
it's so simple yet so hydrating and balancing.
it's makes my pores looks smaller
im glad that i can wash my face without worrying about harmful ingredients that will irritate
t usually take a while to clear out my pores
doesn't make my skin feel dry
sometimes it's sensitive, sometimes it's not.
this wash is it
it's gentle enough that it doesn't dry me out or cause any redness
it didn't clean my skin
not the least bit drying or irritating, either.
it doesn't strip my skin
i usually don't invest a lot of money on cleansers because since they are rinsed off
don't have to use much for foam.
i hardly notice the scent
i like that you don't need a lot for it to foam up
don't have to worry about clogged pores from makeup
only downside was that i felt like i had to rinse my face excessively to ensure the product wasn't leaving a residue
so it's not great at removing makeup.
i usually double cleanse anyway
my face doesn't feel like it's gonna crack anymore when i finish washing my face
it also doesn't make me oily in the areas where i usually get oily
love how foamy it gets too
just don't get it in your nose
i also don't feel like i'm using a cleanser with tons of junk in it
i wasn't expecting much since most cleansers seem to dry my skin out
since you barely need any to get a huge lather
thought that called for suds
it doesn't take you 15 minutes of rinsing to wash it off
doesn't strip my skin too much
this stuff doesn't irritate my skin or dry me out
nor is it greasy
gentle cleanser for people who want something simple that still does the job right
it's not super drying
i actually have combination skin
does not leave a greasy feeling
my face doesn't feel as tight as with other cleanser after washing
this wash doesn't leave my skin feeling stripped
couldn't seem to find the perfect face wash that doesn't dry out my skin until now
have been searching for a cleanser that doesn't give my skin that tight feeling
doesn't leave my skin feeling tight
i love this product as it is not abrasive to your skin
this is not your typical cream cleanser as it does lather a bit
i love that this is not as drying as regular acne treatment products because those can make your skin overcompensate
its maybe one pimple
i always follow with a moisturizers anyway
it's not really very oily anywhere
i hardly wear makeup now because i don't find it necessary to hide my imperfections behind makeup
make sure to rub it with your fingertips until it becomes translucent before applying on your face to prevent breakouts
can i just tell you the mixture is life changing.
one jar plus a little spatula is all you need.
if i could afford it i would soak my skin in a vat of this stuff
my face doesn't look like a red orange peel anymore
my face doesn't get oily like it used to.
if not done correctly it will clog your pores
don't apply like you do with a regular moisturizer
my skin looks better even when it's bare
even if this does have ingredients that read like old school granny cold cream
not wearing bb cream or any coverup cause my skin looked that bomb
you can't spread it on like regular moisturizer
moisturises like nothing i have ever used
i wouldn't bother with the gel cream.
it even faded the scar to where it can't be seen anymore
i cannot stress enough how you'll love this.
i don't care for the smell
i usually just rub my moisturizer on all over my skin
it's a different texture than what you're probably used to
not just a layer of heavy cream
get acnes all the time
i lightly scrape the tip of my nail to get a very small amt
i think the oily reviews are using too much.
you'll be spending $50 a month or so on a moisturizer
i love this cream because not only does it help keep my skin soft
it's crazy sometimes people think i'm still a high school student
this one truly works wonders on my acne prone combination skin
you just won't get these great results from other creams
la mer has always been the one that neutralizes all the shenanigans my face decide to do
there is nothing like it in terms of making your skin so baby soft
it's more of a winter product for me
t can really do its work without makeup layered over it
it actually lasts long cuz you only take very small amount of it melted in your palm then press it slightly on your skin
if your don't like this cream exchange it or return it
it's hard to justify $80 for 1oz
this cream does make your skin glowy
feels like baby skin no exaggeration
feels so good slathering it on my face.
although i can't make it a staple moisturizer
another time it was the only moisturizer that didn't clog the pores when i was breaking out quite badly
naturally you can't get that from simply a deluxe sample
i can't get enough of this amazing moisturizer.
i can't live without this eye cream.
still do not have any wrinkles under my eyes
it's like muscle confusion
i don't have a lot of dark circles under my eye
you really only need the size of 2 peas to lather your entire face
i don't like feeling sticky or tacky
there's a bouncy quality to my skin that it hasn't had with other products
i find that it doesn't cause any milia either which i often struggle with if an eye cream is too heavy
you cant argue with results: skin is hydrated
it's helped with breakouts
and you only need 2 drops for your face
wasn't too heavy or left me feeling oily in my t-zone
a little puffiness on days when i get less sleep or cry
it's just right not too heavy
doesn't leave your skin feeling oily
you do have to shake it because it separates
it's a very rare instance i find a skin care item that blows me away
it can get a little flaky if you don't pat it in until it absorbs
not an eye cream
it's as if it's not as noticeable
it didn't break out my sensitive skin
i can only imagine how radiant my skin would be with use of this over time
i love this serum because it doesn't clog my pores or break me out
i don't use it during the day because i am so oily i don't like anything on my face except primer
my skin is so gorgeous that i rarely wear foundation anymore
sometimes i put it on before my makeup
sometimes i put on moisturizer first
it's instantly smoother to the touch
being a gal who doesn't often splurge on fancy beauty products
can't comment on this product actually lightening up any dark spots
it's good for redness
helps if you have dark spots or post acne marks
it's a little bit glittery but i like it!
i don't wear make up
it's all in one!
i love this primer it goes on smooth
my makeup looks flawless you only need a dime size in your t-zone
i don't recommend using it before your makeup though
it seems weird to add a liquid like this over top of your makeup
the pores themselves didn't seem to get smaller
if you want your skin looks photoshopped
i even wear this on my no makeup days to just give my face a smooth
unfortunately it made it so this product did nothing to my bare skin as my face is already matte
it isn't a skin primer
rather a skin care mechanism to wear on bare face or
don't expect them to be hidden completely
it's a use-over-your-makeup product that blurs imperfections
didn't feel like you were adding another layer of products on your face
it's great for smoothing out your skin
when i used it i noticed it took my skin a lot longer to look oily
have large pores or even just prefer a matte skin look
if you don't prefer a slippy silicone feel then definitely get a sample first
t doesn't feel like you're caking up your face
totally blurs your face which as a sleep deprived mom is outst
not overpowering like some products.
it won't get too oily
it doesn't wear off easy
you can even dab a little on top.
it's smoother everything out !
this product is gonna be my go to everyday in the summer for that matte fresh look
even make your skin look like it's cracking
if you're oily, then this is nirvana.
although i do not have oily skin
my t zone can get quite oily
what i noticed when i applied this product on was that my makeup was super matte
not a heavy or oily product which is nice.
i love using this product underneath makeup the most
make sure you pat it into the skin because rubbing it in will not give you the proper effect
it's like walking around with a filter on
plus it doesn't leave your skin feeling like you have caked on makeup which i love
this stuff instantly smoothens out my complexion
it's easy to apply day
especially if you're not wearing makeup or you're wearing light to medium coverage foundation
because it made my face look cakey when i used it with full coverage foundation
a lot of shiseido products can be worn over makeup
i always hated those heavy silicone based primers that claim they matify yet turn my makeup into an oil slick after a few hours
it's the perfect size for your purse
didn't make my face shiny
felt i shouldn't wear it into the office
i usually wear makeup daily because as i age i have begun to feel self conscious about my pores
it doesn't leave any residue or tackiness
doesn't disturb my makeup underneath
helps my skin to look extra smooth under makeup or alone
nothing ever fills them
i think it would perform even better on someone with oily or combination skin because of it's mattifying effect
although this can easily be mistaken for primer
it didn't clog my pores or make me produce more oil
dab a little bit in areas where you find yourself typically oiling out throughout the day
make it look like you are using a filter in your normal life i love it
ok forget that super complicated name
it only takes a tiniest bit on your t-zone too
will make your makeup pill if you use it underneath
t doesn't clog my pores
i could still see some pores
though it did not completely hide my pores
does not irritate my skin
i love this product for my no makeup days.
the filter is not a primer is a miracle for skip for all that makeup process
it does a nice job of blurring pores
i love the use this under my makeup directly: it's not a primer
this really makes my pores almost disappear.
i just pat some on over my makeup or if i get oily during the day
you instantly feel it's smooth
it transformed my skin into a soft subtle baby softness you can't get anywhere else
is actually a serum so a tiny pea size will cover your entire face because it melts in as you deliver it to your thirsty face
just melts as you apply it
some evenings i skip the moisturizer as i find this is enough on its own
doesn't irritate my skin in the slightest
of course i get a pimple every now
don't forget to put on your neck
it was kinda heavy
not only does it feel like dessert for my face it also smells like dessert
the pimples just would not go away
i like how my fine lines just absorbs the product
it's like a combination of sugar
this cream makes your skin glow just a little bit goes a long way
this does not feel heavy on
i don't think i've ever used a facial cream that has smelled so good
my skin can't get any worse
i love pressed serum it's so easy to apply
doesn't rise off well
if your oily combo you can't use this alone you'll break out you need to follow it with regular cleanser
just rub this all over an it melts of your face
this cleanser is unlike any i have tried
the consistency is so smooth but not too oily.
nothing gets the makeup
not to mention no more tugging at my eyes to get my mascara off
it's like something isn't sealed properly.
it's very easily washed off.
i did prefer the smell of the caudalie oil
doesn't leave my face
i actually would use this as a single cleanse if i were too lazy
i usually use josie maran
doesn't stick eyes too
it doesn't feel greasy & it washes off easily.
this cleanser clears my face of all that hard to get rid of mascara
i love this type of makeup remover over anything else
if you don't wear waterproof makeup
i expected it to feel oily but it wasn't at all!
doesn't leave any residue?checkneed a cleanser that takes seconds to remove everything
waterproof makeup doesn't stand a chance.
it's also nice because it doesn't leave your skin feeling all dry
combination or oil skin or acne prone skin this stuff is amazing
it's fine under makeup
we don't care about our skin looking dewy
when i use it the morning i don't need to put on the cologne
which is amazing because i've tried so many products to get rid the the redness
in the past year i tried at least 5 different creams that didn't work for me -- they either weren't moisturizing enough
on the lookout for a moisturizer that wasn't too greasy
this is one of the few moisturizers that i have tried that doesn't break out my face
this is a gel aka its not gonna save lives its specifically for puffiness
i don't usually leave my opinion
it is not greasy!!!
it is perfect under concealer which i have struggled to find one that doesn't have my concealer moving all round all day
a big plus, it does not sting my eyes.
i love it sooo much the only eye gel that doesn't sting
just don't expect any magical effects if you sleep 2-3 hours a day
because this product is not greasy it goes well under makeup
if i go makeup free i still have to just wear concealer because people really do think i have two black eyes
i've never bothered with serums.
it's to the point where i would consider going in public without my under eye concealer
packaging sucks because you can't tell when you're low
now that i noticed it's out of stock
i don't think the gel moisturizes enough tho
i wouldn't say it will get rid of your dark eye circles
i love that it's so light yet hydrating.
it feels so weightless when you apply it
you can tell that your skin brightens up
it's all thanks to this gel
the eye gel also doesn't get into my eyes
while i can't say it'll make dark circles disappear
i never get a "fragrance" headache
that stuff is liquid gold
it's like a miracle in a bottle
irritation i often get is gone
if you read up on squalane oil you'll feel so much better about putting that on your face compared to what's in some other oils
when you use natural stuff
i normally don't use oils
can't believe i've been avoiding oils till now.
doesn't leave an oily feeling
doesn't affect my liquid foundation/makeup staying on my face all day long
best thing is that it's not a synthetic fragrance so not toxic
they're not lying about that 30% more bright claim
not overpowering at all
nothing artificial or unpleasant
there's actual science inside every bottle
every time i used this on my face i would breakout in a bunch of small pimples
i can't believe the difference it has made in the softness of my skin
doesn't feel like a mask on my face
it's will hydrate your skin like nothing else.
i also love that i can use it for my hair.
i did make the mistake of using too much on my wet hair
it doesn't leave me feeling greasy
it doesn't cause break outs.
i noticed my lashes have gotten longer as i use the whole product line from makeup cleanser
i forget i'm even wearing an oil!
it's less than half the cost of josie maran argan oil
does not leave you looking greasy
is enough to cover my face
only 1-2 drops does the trick
literally if you are a lazy bum like me
can wear it under my makeup
it's really hard to find a product that doesn't feel overwhelming once it's applied
it doesn't clog my skin
i don't have any stretch marks
it's never broken me out or caused any irritation
it's the only thing i've tried so far that tames my nasty winter lips
i put some on my hair even.
i like that it's in a tube instead of a tub
does not leave a tacky feeling on the skin
the only thing i don't like is the packaging.
doesn't irritate my skin.
my skin doesn't get overly oily
i am sure that it may sting if you are new to acids
there's a reason this stuff sells out so fast every time it's restocked
this doesn't seem to cause much of a purge period
t's good if you want to switch routines without making your skin freak out
whenever i get a blemish whether or not i pick at it
it's all in the application
i usually hate putting sunscreen on because it always feels so heavy
this product itself does not fade acne scars
easy to blend down without that blatantly obnoxious spf smell
this product doesn't have any of the troublesome ingredients i avoid like alcohol
sometimes i get breakouts
it's definitely a plus when i mix it with my drunk elephant hydra b in the am when i need an extra kick of moisture
sometimes i have to skip a night otherwise i get too dry
it also completely sinks in so you don't have to worry about it messing up your makeup
i appreciate that sk-ii includes a spatula with the product so you don't have to use your fingers in the jar
i do like this cream
this eye cream is a wonder.
it has a silky feel to it and it's not too heavy.
the lotion barely has any scent which is what i would prefer for something going near my eyes
it doesn't burn but it is a little greasy.
love the smell and didn't leave residue.
i don't need eye lines as well
did not irritate my eyes like other eye creams have
it's a bit oily for me as a day time eye cream since i have combination skin
sometimes i don't get home until 1:00 am
you can wear this under your makeup if you do not have a heavy h
don't worry about the glass container.
it is very hard for me to find an eye cream that does not make my skin dry out or even cause it to be too sticky feeling
won't get rid of wrinkles
the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars was because it made my skin sticky after application
it comes with a little spatula so you aren't digging your fingers in the product every time
probably because all of the hydration
what i usually look for in eye cream is that it has to be gentle enough to use around my eyes
power eye cream did not give my eyes any irritation
doesn't have any odor
it also doesn't flake or make my make up flake.
don't have many wrinkles yet
it's not greasy and doesn't clog my pores.
i do like the eye cream
i don't have any eye wrinkles
needless to say parenthood comes with some serious sleep deprivation
it's super easy to apply
i simply love this eye cream
it's the only cream that lightened my under eye area
don't wash my face enough
when you're putting anything by your eye
it's thick in consistency but not overly so.
there is no greasy feeling after application
my eye make up does not get those greasy creases you get with other eye creams
sometimes with other eye creams if they do not absorb well you sometimes find it will run into your eyes
do you have wrinkles and lines in your eyes?
i love how silly smooth the cream is
it's not greasy and smells fine.
although you only use a dab or so everyday
that it doesn't burn my eyes like some eye creams do
while it's not cheap
it has not been irritating to my skin
it's not too thick and heavy.
if you need a tightening feeling before your makeup
the only thing is that i have to pat it in after any serums
after the first use my skin wasn't overly oily for the whole day
it's gentle too, and doesn't dry me out.
it's the last thing i use i wake up with my t zone kinda oily
it's suppose to be a oil control cleanser
i know it won't be everyone's cup of tea
this is one of the only cleansers that actually cleared my skin
i still have bad breakouts
it's not abrasive and doesn't leave any residue.
this cleanser not only does it's job
not shiny like normal
it foams up lie crazy
it literally only takes one pea size drop of cleanser to get a really good wash
i do get small patches of acne pretty often on my chin
while i'm not sure this cleanser
it doesn't make my skin feel stripped like many cleansers formulated for oily skin seem to do
it's only reduced oiliness right after i use it
i can't be mad that my oiliness is gone
balanced without stripping it of too much moisture or irritating it
there is no tightening that you would experience from a bha cleanser
if you're suffering from a skin reaction
a nice sephora worker did a facial on me by using this product
it's always too oily and too uneven and too red.
so far the entire line of products has worked for my super oily skin
like, it's pretty dramatic and it's a miracle.
it doesn't dry out my face like the murad cleanser did
i do notice that my skin is a little less oily
not in that odd squeaky-clean way
still manages to take off all of my makeup is near impossible
the only drawback was that even though i have oily skin
so you only need a small drop to get a great lather
it's not that great for removing makeup
if you prefer a fragrance free cleanser this may not be for you
it didn't strip my skin
i did notice a glow to my skin whenever i use this cleanser which was nice especially on makeup free days
i think that because it has ahas it either wont be that effective because ahas typically have to stay on your skin for a while or might do too much if ahas are already in your skincare routine
it's even encouraged me to wash my face more
you'll notice that this cleanser warms your face a little
it doesn't aggravate my skin
when it comes to cleansers i am not too picky
it got rid of any extra oil as well as any makeup residue
my face doesn't look shiny
it's not drying or stripping
so you have to lather it before applying it all over
this ole henriksen find your balance oil control cleanser has replaced my morning cleanser
it does not strip the skin
a little goes a looooong way as i use a pea sized amount
i totally recommend this to the oily/acne prone people out there
let me just start by saying that i have combination skin that leans more on the side of oily
this combo definitely keeps you super oily free all day
however i can't wait to use this in the summer when i'm super oily
a little goes along way when youre applying it.
doesn't seem to dry out the skin at all
which is why i don't think this product should be limited to people with oily skin
it's non drying and doesn't strip your skin.
it's a tad too drying for my skin
sometimes certain cleansers don't work so well for my skin
this cleanser has not made me break out
i don't use highlighter anymore
your skin will love you for it
it doesn't leave any residue after using
it doesn't get as sudsy as i thought
however i would recommend it for girls or guys who suffer from really oily skin
(fyi i would not use this to remove eye makeup!!)
clogged pores without feeling like it's completely stripping your skin
sometimes the products don't work for me
it can sometimes sting if i get it near my eye area
i get the immediate "squeaky clean" feeling that i lack with my other cleansers
because it's supposed to help fight acne
didn't feel drying at all!
i don't have those baby bumps on my forehead anymore it's crazy
doesn't leave that chalky look
it's really good at keeping away grease
i normally put my primer on before i do my hair
not at all greasy.
my bottle doesn't seem to have a tube inside connected to the pump?
my combination skin is awful when it comes to finding a moisturizer
only because the bottle doesn't always dispense very well
it's a great product if you wear makeup
not as a daily moisturizer with nothing on your face since it's very effective as what it advertises
since i don't wear makeup
doesn't clog my pores
it definitely doesn't keep me oil-free all day
otherwise i will get flaky skin
it's not a little oily where it's dewy
it's by no means a miracle product
it doesn't make your face as smooth if you slather too much on
this may help some of you who feel that the ole balancing products are too drying
not heavy perfect to use before makeup
keeps me from getting as oily as i normally do
i don't have to blot nearly as often
doesn't clog my pores
i can skip the primer and just use this.
it's light without being greasy.
it's not sticky or greasy.
i can't wait to try the scrub
as i don't like how sticky it feels on my skin
the pump doesn't go to the bottom
a lot of primers don't work for me on their own or they leave a white cast on melanin rich skin
use a different moisturizer everywhere else
would make this my main moisturiser except it doesn't contain spf
not only did this moisturizer make my face feel fresh
it didn't make my skin more oily than it naturally is
not cause any acne
even gets rid of my acne the way this product does
if you are sensitive to the peppermint effervesce you might want to start out with a sample
i don't usually break out
isn't greasy at all
i just can't give it a couple of stars on account of just my pimple/breaking out issue
my only complaint is that there is not as much product in the bottle as the cleanser or even toner
my skin tends to get a bit more oily during this time
it didn't matter if i used setting spray or setting powder
it's not something that makes your skin feel completely oily again like a lot of hydrating products do
i think this is perfect for on the go or if you are bare face
going to go workout this would work well for you because it is not oily or greasy
i love that it doesn't feel heavy
it's not bad especially for people who have oily skin
doesn't clog my pores
need lotion for the more humid months not that i'm overly oily or anything
now we're talking fry
i can't wait to continue using the oil control line
i really like that this moisturizer isn't heavy
isn't too light either
it's not oily or heavy
it doesn't aggravate my skin
i actually love the oil control product has well me a lot with my oily face
it's not oily afterwards either
i don't like to be super matte
if you prefer matte
or if you just have normal to oily skin like me
so your skin doesn't try to hydrate itself with unnecessary oil
use this on days i wear makeup
would 10/10 recommend if you wear light bb cream
you're not going to get tons of moisture
let me just start by saying that i have combination skin that leans more on the side of oily
my only problem is the smell
others will make me even more oily
i like that this isn't sticky
overall i would give this collection a try if you generally have normal to oily skin that gets congested
i would recommend this product to anyone who has oily areas of their face
once it's on your skin you don't even smell it anymore
this doesn't make it look more oily
i doesn't interfere with my makeup primer
wouldn't know how this hydrator performs at night
it's great for oily skin even in the winter.
heavy moisturisers still break me out this one doesn't so for me it's a definite must buy
your skin will love it
it doesn't have any lingering residue
acne prone skin so this entire line has been a god send to me
this is perfect in the mornings to avoid getting too shiny or oily
is that it did make my skin sting
i came to the conclusion i'm too lazy to use the cleanser version
it doesn't do much for evening out skin tone
the bad tho is that the product does leak out.
my routine is quite simple because my skin doesn't need mich
doesn't bother my sensitive skin at all
that happens when you over moisturizer
otherwise this is a good eye cream
it definitely stings if you get it into your eyes so just gently pat under your eyes
for those of you that aren't milia prone
it gives me the most annoying headaches in the entire world
i don't think eye cream is supposed to burn.
'm assuming i'm just hot
it's somehow "sweating" into my eye?
doesn't feel oily like some
fast absorbing which is good because it doesn't feel heavy under the eyes
i struggle with crepey texture with concealers if my eye cream doesn't work just right
do yourself a favor and buy this eye cream!
i know that's a moisturizer too
it's just not hydrating enough
make up that does not cause pilling
this doesn't run in the heat
there is no need to worry if it is too yellow or too pink
women of color do not need to worry about that dreaded ghostly cast that we are all familiar with
please put this in a squeeze tube or something that doesn't go everywhere
not necessarily a thick coverage
or don't feel like going full on insta-hoe
i applied this product today with a little blush
didn't think i would like this skin tint so much since most base products don't match me or last on my oily skin
i can't tolerate most foundations
it's good skin care
not to look like i'm wearing makeup
you can also set it with powder if you want a matte look
that's normal for me even with full coverage matte foundations
it's kind of dark for me
it just doesn't settle or get patchy like foundations
it gives coverage somehow
it's awesome for days when i don't have the time or energy to do a full face of makeup
it's a budget friendly product because you're getting two-in-one
it doesn't clog pores or break me out
it doesn't make me greasy
the lotion is just bad
doesn't create excess oil or feel "heavy"
using other moisturizers or even oil controlling products would only make my skin more greasy
it makes my face less greasy.
it's the only thing that is not breaking me out beside la prairie
cream are too greasy for me
it's less red after i use this
you sometimes get a little overzealous with it
i never feel like it's too heavy
i enjoy this stuff because you don't need to rinse after using
i normally don't use eye creams, gels: etc.
what's amazing is that it seems to truly cleanse my skin
it doesn't irritate me at all
when i got lazy
my only complaint is it's a little thin so when i apply it ends up going on my finger tips
i don't mind the consistency or the scent
doesn't feel heavy or sticky
tones down any redness like nothing else i've ever used
my deep ugly wrinkle looks like a fine line
it's not sticky and great under moisturizers.
i put it on before my make up which doesn't make my makeup look oily through out the day
the smell isn't that bad as people claim
it does even out the skin tone
if you are in your early 30's with oily or combination skin this is great
i can't get over how my skin looks.
watery--didn't provide much hydration
it's light once absorbed
if you need a basic eye cream not a miracle worker this is perfect
does not feel greasy.
does not feel greasy.
as someone with really oily skin i do find that if i use too much i can get a small clogged pore
the really uncontrollable embarrassingly shiny kind
it doesn't make you fill like its dripping off your face or a heavy filling
it does not play well with a wet beauty blender
makeup will splotch out if you don't let it set in first
i don't have any kind of oily skin
i don't get breakouts
i wear this under my primer
i don't know how, but this cured my acne!!
i don't think the smell is bad at all or overpowering whatsoever
a little goes a long way- i know many beauty gurus pour drops all over their cheeks
doesn't disturb my primer or foundation at all
even when i do i don't find that this product irritates my skin
this oil doesn't sit on my skin
yes it's on the pricey side
therefore, your face does get oily.
i don't think it's a bad product
oils tend to break me out
i don't know it the gold flakes are an added bonus skin care wise
i wouldn't use this in the morning as i find it stays oily on my skin
plus the gold flakes are so pretty!
especially since this elixir doesn't take forever to dry like a regular oil
i can go 12 hours without worrying about my oily face
it doesn't guve me breakouts
how could i resist buying it when it has gold flakes that melt on your skin?
wanted to bash it as another overly hyped-up product
not sure if it's the elixir or the babypeel i've been using
are usually put a couple drops into my beauty blender
everyone's skin is so different
i mean that i now mix a few drops of this stuff into my anti-wrinkle cream
definitely let it soak in to the skin for like 10 minutes if you don't want to look oily or cakey though
it's not a thick oil which is great
the dropper doesn't feel very secure
it's perfect for application when put onto brushes/beauty blenders
i love how this sinks into my skin
great for lips of you are wanting to put a liquid lipstick on
i usually get a lot of buildup on my nose's pores
love the smell too.
i'd recommend not to put it on the focal points of your face if you're really oily
it's good for all skin types
i've had such consistently good skin i haven't even needed to touch my foundation or concealer
somehow 1-2 drops a day of this magic makes my face amazing
her pimples looked less mean
can someone please turn this into a perfume?
not to mention the spring glow i got going on.
some drops on my lips to prep for lipstick my makeup blended insanely perfectly like no words to describe how well it worked
this helps my makeup not look chalky
it didn't "skip" or become patchy
do not use a creme moisturizer use a gel base one it does not crumble what so ever
i still have oily skin no matter what
i don't see it making me oilier in any way
didn't cake up like it normally does under my eyes
i didn't really notice much of a difference than when i moisturize my face before i use a primer
did not clog my pore or interact with my makeup weird in anyway
this is coming from someone with seriously textured
it didn't budge in the nasty humid summer we've been having
i don't recommend using it on your lips because it's not really designed for that
it's tacky when you rub it into the skin so you know it's gonna make your makeup stick all day
once on you can't see any sparkle or glitter
i can't stop looking at how flawless my face looks after using this as a primer
i usually use it with another primer.
you can't really smell it after application
don't have the same smell
i know it's a little pricey
why not having a primer that benefits your complexion
it's the best as a moisturizer or primer if you have oily skin
people complaining about it feeling sticky- duh?
it's meant to be used as a primer?
this stuff is bomb makes my makeup look so flawless smooth it is not oily at all
i don't think it's supposed to be a moisturizer like a few people are using it as although it does moisturize in addition to prime
it quickly soaks into your skin making it feel like you haven't added any product to your face
it may seem pricy
you can use it as an eye shadow primer too!
it gets your makeup to stick to your skin
it's invisible on your skin
not as a makeup primer
for me it doesn't leave my skin feeling sticky or anything
yes you can use it by itself to hydrate your skin
that's why it leaves a sticky film on your skin
once it sinks into your skin you barely smell it.
i don't think it's a bad product
it's perfect my makeup stays on all day
although it says it can be used as a highlighter for me it doesn't
i don't see any glow when i use it alone.
i do use setting powder too
it's just the right amount of stickiness to lock my makeup in place
it's not a primer even
it doesn't feel sticky to me
there's no glitter on my face
now it's a staple in my makeup routine.
they all leave my skin super greasy
strangely enough the glitter doesn't show on your face
i don't want to have a face full of glitter
so your face isn't left feeling greasy or sticky at all
it doesn't make it shiny or greasy
i rarely wear makeup
it does have glitter
it takes my waterproof mascara off with ease which i had trouble doing with other makeup removers
i started having a bad reaction to other makeup removers around my eyes
it works and it's not harsh!
my skin doesn't look or feel as though it's being dried out- quite the opposite
it doesn't irritate the eyes
this stuff literally just melts away even the most stubborn eye makeup without any effort
it takes off 100% of my makeup even when i do full glam
doesn't leave behind a residue
just make sure you wash your face with a proper cleanser after
i love that it's a one-stop cleansing solution
i can't say if it will remove all of your makeup if you wear makeup-artist levels of product
didn't leave me with raccoon eyes once
i may still end up buying a jar of this for occasional use because i love it that much
i wouldn't recommend it if you have oily skin.
i will not go one day without this cruelty free miracles makeup remover in a jar
avoid getting it in your eyes or you will have blurry vision
it does make yours eyes a foggy when using
i don't need much product to lather on my face
i usually don't for it does irritate them
when i'm in a super lazy mood
gets my skin ready for the actual cleanser to do its thing
clean that you could use it as just a cleanser
not even to remove makeup
it does make your eyes a little foggy so just bear that in mind if you use it to take off your eye makeup ifthat bothers you- it did not burn or hurt just made my eyes a little foggy temporarily
it's great that they include a spatula to help you get it all out without grubbing it up with your fingers
love that it's so concentrated!
and it doesn't sting my eyes at all.
it really does melt away your makeup.
does not burn my eyes
actually cleans off my makeup
does not leave residue
i do like the way the balm cleans
in the past i always felt like a needed a cleanser after i used a balm to remove my makeup
i can't put my finger on it
it doesn't have a strong scent
it doesn't sting my eyes
it feels just like a cleansing oil
doesn't leave a gross feeling residue
you won't find a makeup remover better than this one
it's a rinse-off product any way
it's like cleaning your face with butter!
what i love is that it removes even pesky mascara
t doesn't tug at my eyelids which is also very comforting
otherwise it's a great product
usually there's always some mascara left over
this is the only makeup remover i've used that can remove it completely
i love this cleansing balm so much--it beats all my other ones
it's amazing at removing makeup
usually i do anyways to really get that deep clean
i can't use anything that smells floral on my face because my nose is so sensitive to that
someone mentioned the cloudiness when using it on the eyes--this is something really not uncommon with cleansing balms
it melts away all your makeup
my eyes went a little foggy for a bit because of the oils haha
doesn't tug at all
i still do that with this balm
i don't use it on my eyes.
i just prefer to use my dior eye makeup remover for my eyes
this really does melt away makeup
it's all around my mouth
one jar does it all!
normally not one to wash my makeup off at night i use this even if i only had on mascara
it's very lightly scented anyway
it really does clean makeup away super easily
i find it essentially does everything oil cleansing does
it is literally the only cleanser i have ever tried that actually removes all of my makeup
it easily takes off all my makeup
it's not at all oily on my skin
i think it's the most gentle way to remove makeup
there's no way to get my waterproof eyeliner off without some rubbing
i just don't get why everyone seems to be crazily in love with micellar water
sometimes i get a tiny bit of eyeliner left on my putter corners where my lids fold in an weird way
it is not irritating toy eyes.
it does seem to leave a film on the eye balls if you get a little bit in your eyes
it would irritate a bit
i tried this product because i have a bad habit of not washing my face at night
i also like that it comes with a little spatula
when i say it melts
i mean it just glides on
not greasy or 'unfinished' if that makes sense?
this makes my evening routine not so messy or daunting
i can't tell you how easy makeup removal is now
it's funny because i thought blue moon made it easy
doesn't leave your face feeling greasy or gross after you wash it off
i love using this to remove my makeup.
you barely have to rub your face
sometimes i use a face wash after
truly does melt away all traces of makeup
so the only downside is having to use a spatula to scoop it out since i don't want to contaminate it with my fingers
with all that's out there though i'm going to be trying urban decays
i don't wear heavy makeup though — never eyeliner —
also not so heavy that i couldn't use it as my am cleanser
benefit they're real mascara on
when it does its magic
was leery because usually cream cleaners don't wash off easily
this stuff starts melting your makeup off almost immediately
it leaves no residue behind whatsoever if you rinse well
lipstick that usually takes a whole lot of scrubbing?
it did not remove my eye makeup
seriously love everything about this cleansing balm
it easily melts off all the traces of stubborn make up of your face
comes with a little plastic spatula so you don't have to dig your dirty heads into the container
it's just such a gentle way to remove makeup
this product takes off all your makeup
doesn't pull on your eyes
or just make me break out or leave my skin feeling oily
if you've hated cleansing balms really try this one
it doesn't burn my eyes or make them cloudy.
doesn't sting my eyes or make them cloudy
i also like that it comes with a little spatula.
this removes all of my makeup even my water proof eye liner
not greasy at all
this product is soft enough so that you just have to use a tiny of pressure to remove makeup
please don't ever stop making this amazing cleanser
not greasy like the boscia does
it doesn't burn my sensitive eyes
i don't get much acne ever since i was on accutane
it doesn't get red or irritated it as much or as easy
would suggest removing your contacts if you want to avoid the balm getting on them
it doesn't have a strong scent
this one takes makeup off completely-don't have to use makeup remover afterwards
this is not a true "oil cleanser
it actually foams quite a bit if you add a little water to the palms of your h
i noticed there wasn't much reviews on this product when it comes to hair so here it goes: i suffer from frizzy hair like many people
i cannot ever let my hair air dry or i will look like a poodle
i feel like most beauty oils just kinda sit in a thin layer on top of the skin
it's a well absorbing oil that doesn't leave my skin greasy
who still want a glowy lumiinous skin
looks like a mask when it's on the face
doesn't strip your skin
it's not like any other cleansing oil i've used.
my skin doesn't get oily right away like it used it
even if i forget to wash it
it's lightweight enough for my oily skin to not get as oily as quickly as it used to
or irritate my skin in any way
it doesn't leave my skin feeling clogged or too oily
am usually a greasy mess by 3:00
it's just the right amount of moisture
does not make my skin look or feel oily at all
sometimes struggle to find a good moisturizer with spf because they usually have a greasy feel that isn't comfortable
does not leave a white cast so you can wear this on its own as well
i love the fact that it's a three in one moisturizer
it doesn't have that awful sunscreen smell
does not increase to oily feeling on my face at all
i could never find sunblock that wasn't greasy
i feel like this doesn't leave a white cast
this is the only one i've found that doesn't leave a film on my skin
it doesn't make me break out or feel like it's clogging up my skin
white rather than clear-ish
it does sink it pretty quick without that heavy sunscreen oily feeling
be careful not to get any near your mouth
i never get a moisturizer without at least 30 spf
when you close your eyes this cream make you think you are in a spa
it wont give you a shiny white mask.
it doesn't matter if you layer toner
pro's: • absorb super fast • great for oily eye lids since it does not leave a greasy residue • spf • great under make up • love the simple squeeze tube
it's an age-defense eye cream
finally an eye cream with spf that isn't super pricy
i rarely rub my eyes
it's hard to find an eye cream with spf
i didn't notice much of a white cast
it tends to get oily in the t-zone
i never use my fingers.
they didn't sting my sensitive peepers
be sure to use the extra gel on your neck too!
i simply drop some spf on
doesn't help with oil control tho cause my nose is still shiny 4 hrs in
it doesn't smell cheap
it leaves a nice cooling effect that doesn't last overly long
after testing i'm fairly certain that the reason it leaves others feeling "tacky" or "sticky" is because they are using an excessive amount of product that would cause any thicker moisturizer to take a longer amount of time to sink into the skin
the packaging is the usually pompous glass jar that you'll need be able to travel with
it's so light textured, like a gel but not quite.
doesn't clog up your pores
i love how it melt on my skin
i love that is not heavy on my skin
nor does it leave an oily feeling or sticky feeling on my skin at all
doesn't burn or irritate my skin
t doesn't feel heavy or harsh
doesn't burn my face or agitate my skin
removes every little bit of makeup.
thanks to this product no greasy mess
removes every little bit of makeup while making you skin feel sup er soft
it truly does leave the skin plump
i don't have 20 minutes to do a mask
i didn't even use a moisturizer after the mask because you just remove the extra
typically dior products break me out
it is gentle enough that it doesn't irritate my skin
it's a deep enough cleanser that i feel as if i am truly getting my skin clean
i can't give it 5 stars because it's just so expensive
i don't have to scrub
tada, no more makeup!
i usually use benefits they're real remover as a quick remove
this is one of the few mw that i have tried that doesn't leave a sticky feeling on the skin
it is a bit pricy so that's why it's a 4-star for me
i don't that annoying oil film over my vision
tug on my eye area anymore like i used to
wrinkles whenever i don't have enough oil on my face
i occasionally flirt with other skin care lines
i can't wait to see the long term effects of this mask
that makes it feel like it's really penetrating deep into the pores of my skin
then you have the option of dampening it again while it's on your face for deeper exfoliation before rinsing
it is absolutely obvious that it's pulling junk in my pores to the surface
i am almost positive it's because it's working things to the surface
it's sooo easy to do extractions because things are pulled up
i've never seen my pores on my nose look so
i've yet to find a product that actually cleaned out my pores
even after just one use i don't see as many blackheads
it doesn't irritate or dehydrate my skin
when my skin is looking dull
it's great and removes the blackheads.
when i use this mask in particular i can see a difference in my blackheads instantly
i've always had horrible clogged pores in my tzone
this doesn't irritate me
it's a litter thicker than i'm used to so didn't know what to think at first
there wasn't a heavy or greasy feeling at all
i like how it's a gel-like texture: maybe a water gel
it doesn't feel sticky at all
plus it doesn't left with any greasy feelings.
i don't need to alternate between moisturizers anymore because this keeps my skin perfectly balanced
shockingly we all agreed it's either this or lemaire no more drugstore products for us at least not to moisturise drugstore products we can stick to an everyday type mascara
or blush certainly not something that you wear every day like the skin on your face
this is great for hydration that doesn't leave the skin feeling super sticky
it does not feel heavy
it does not clog my pores
you'll love this cream for daytime use
doesn't have a potent smell
everything you've ever use is going straight out of your routine
it does not leave the skin feeling sticky.
it dries instantly & does not leave a residue.
doesn't leave my face irritated or uncomfortable
it smells like what's in it
my skin is picky when it comes to masks with a clay type texture
when it dries down it doesn't crack like other masks
it's really helped with some of my hyper pigmentation from past blemishes
it smells a little like kale when you first put it on
usually wouldn't be into a moisture mask
it washes off really easily too.
i usually don't like face oils during the day because as much as i press into my skin
my skin didn't feel oily or overproduce oil during the day which never happens
it did not throughly remove my makeup
doesn't strip my face
i don't care for the smell
it doesn't break the bank
it does so without making your skin feel like any ounce of moisture in your face was completely stripped away
you can feel it cleaning
this cleanser does both for me even with only one wash
i wear a lot of heavy eye makeup
didn't sting my eyes
it is sort of a cheap bottle like you would expect from a free hotel lotion
if you aren't careful you will waste a ton of product
doesn't make me greasy
i won't even need pore strips
because this product doesn't fill
if they don't discontinue it like they've done with mild clarifying lotion
it doesn't have any oily or wet feeling
i would recommend if you're not wanting to spend over 40 dollars on a water infused moisturizer
my skin doesn't feel irritated
it does feel a bit thick when first applying to face
this product is so good for warmer months bc it isn't greasy or heavy
if you tend to be on the oily side
i find it hard to find moisture products that don't turn me into a greaseball while still helping with hydration
i can see it not working on its own with anything than very oily skin
you'll find it is not sticky once you apply a moisturizer on top
feel that this doesn't do enough as a moisturizer
i doesn't feel like wearing a mask
it also controls my oily t zone really well.
i didn't find it sticky or to have any type of smell at all
especially for summer when i don't want to wear a ton of makeup
i think the reviews stating this is sticky/greasy
had that sticky "i'm never going to absorb" feeling
the pump can be annoying
sometimes no product comes out
helped to clear up my face even if it's supposed to be just a moisturizer??
it's perfect for a nightly routine as well
that's saying something because i have bad eczema
i love that it doesn't contain fragrance, too.
doesn't make your skin feel super dry after
it doesn't get rid of my dehydrated skin from retinol completely
because it doesn't feel heavy or greasy
does not make your skin oily
this mud cleanser is so many things.
you'll get the benefits of a cleanser with the effects of a mud mask
however the mask rips so easily that i don't see the point of ditching my sheet masks for this
this mask isn't truly for clearing up breakouts
i recommend you put the actual mask in the fridge for about 10 min
i usually never purchase sheet masks because i feel like they're a waste of money since it's a one time use
i gave it a four star bc it rips very easily even when you are h
does wonders for the skin
for $12 it's a must buy!
can't wait to try the others in the rubber mask collection
it doesn't slip around
ole henriksen lemon flash peel a few times per week
it's like my pores are gone
i did not find the smell of the mask to be bothersome in any way
i will say be gentle with the rubber mask though because it can tear pretty easily
try it out for sure if you have some small wrinkles forming or aging skin
you'll see results right away
it didn't entirely absorb into my skin
i think it's best to apply at night because there is some stickiness left behind after use
my pores do seem smaller
can't put any makeup on it dry
it is not that sticky with adhering to your face
when i rubbed it in it did still feel a little tacky
thought it was going to be gimmicky
i cannot wait to try the brightening
i can't believe this is made of 100% seaweed
i know it's a little pricey for a one-time use mask
maybe even eat food
my only real issue was that the stuff in the ampoule is a little too thick
it's almost like a pudding consistency.
i feel ordinary ones don't push the product down into the skin like these do
i hate those modeling masks because you have to mix a lot
it's not thick and feels great on the skin.
you feel instant results
if you're just rubbing it in then it will not absorb
wouldn't try to compare those two if you're oily like me
does not clog up my skin
if you do your homework before buying girlies
it's a little pricey for me
if my skin isn't happy with the product i get itchy rush on my cheeks
it's dried my skin out horribly
not greasy at all
my makeup lasts all day
not greasy at all
it's kind of impractical to spend $70 on a moisturizer when i can find another one for less
it's a light cream that doesn't feel like i have a mask full of chemicals all over my face
this moisturizer is great for my skin plus it makes pores disappear
it's really light weight
doesn't feel heavy on my face
sometimes creams break me out or make me shiny after a while
i also love that it doesn't have a strong smell to it
from what i've used-it's everything i need for my combination skin
my t zone tends to be really really oily specially during the spring
hardly any product needs to be used to thoroughly cover one's face
my problem: applying more than a pearl size makes my foundation highlight pores just like primers sometimes do
it sometimes made my foundation look streaky on areas where i put extra moisturizer
when you massage it into the skin it turns into an almost watery consistency that really leaves your skin feeling light
tried so many moisturizers from ole henriksen
my skin doesn't get oily as much throughout the day
i find that throughout the day my skin isn't as oily when i have this product on my face from the morning
it's feel very watery when applying
my face doesn't feel dry anymore
doesn't leave my skin feeling heavy or greasy
i tend to shy away from even using moisturizers
if you hate greasy or heavy moisturizers
does not make my "normal areas" oily
my only issue is my skin looks a little oily about a hour after i apply it
when i rub my face to remove the oil i come to find out it was excess cream so make sure you use minimal amount
it doesn't bother me because i can't feel any heaviness on my skin even when i accidentally use too much
you can feel the texture change from cream to water like as you rub it in
it's a cream but it's not heavy what so ever.
first off, let me say that i have very oily skin.
this product makes my skin feel like its taking a big gulp of water
its so light yet feels like it simply melts into the skin
it doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy or sticky
i also love the little spoon it comes with.
i would recommend putting it on at night rather than morning because the skin does look oily until it fully absorbs
sometimes these creams are better for me as they actually hydrate the skin instead of sitting on top of my skin
i usually have a difficult time finding a moisturizer because it's either too drying if it's made for acne prone skin
it doesn't linger too long
to make sure i wasn't romanticizing this tatcha product
all you need is a little scoop with that spoon
this is a wonder cream!
it's rather difficult for me to find a cream that not only caters to both dry/oily
it's like a splash of water to the face.
it doesn't clog pores or cause blemishes for me
i can tell the difference in my skin when i don't use this moisturizer
i couldn't stop touching my oily areas because i couldn't believe how well this kept oil away
especially if you're oily
my dark spots seem to be fading
it's not heavy or sticky, i enjoy that very much.
i would definitely give it a try if you prefer a lightluxe gel moisturizer instead of a heavy cream
this gives me moisture without giving me grease or feeling like there's any any kind of layer of product on my skin
does not clog my pores
my oily skin can't get enough.
it's made my skin way less oily—moisturized
this absorbs quickly and doesn't feel greasy.
i also did see a reduction in my ridiculous pores
didn't feel greasy or sticky like when i usually apply any moisturizer
i know it's just skin
doesn't feel goopy after application
i don't feel the need to apply a face oil afterwards
they don't feel clogged after applying this cream
my makeup doesn't crease as much underneath my eyes anymore as it used to
i love that it's a pump so essentially no product gets wasted or contaminated
i only use it daytime as i use the expensive stuff at night
my concealer does not budge
it's a super easy mask to use
i love that this is fragrance free so my skin doesn't react to it
so hydrating to the point that my skin isn't oily anymore because it doesn't have to overproduce its own oils
my face doesn't feel sticky because it absorbs like a serum
smooth because i can't even feel it
usually lightweight moisturizers just aren't enough for my skin
i sometimes skip moisturizer in the morning because i have combination skin
if i'm having a particularly oily day i can't h
am actually able to layer other things on my face where sometimes with serums they just don't sink in
that doesn't help with my acne scars
it's sunk in so fast
sunday's products for some reason leave an awkward residue on my skin that cases me to break out
had some that didn't wash away easily
it's also great for removing liquid lipsticks- just place a drop on your lips
decided to give ceo mirco dissolve cleansing oil a try anyway
this takes off makeup so easily
without leaving that super greasy feeling of most other oil makeup removers
it takes off makeup that's for sure!
it's not good with taking off my makeup
i've never tried a cleansing oil
thinking it would make my skin too oily
my favorite part is that it doesn't take any more than water to get it off your h
it really dissolves all your make up!
just don't use this on your eyes!!!
it doesn't leave an oily film or greasy feeling it just makes your skin feel incredibly soft
i typically don't like any cleansers that are based on oil
it doesn't feel greasy like oil at all
it does sting a little if it gets in eyes.
like any makeup remover why would you want it to get into the eyes
it doesn't feel like it's cleaning my face
after i rinse it off there isn't any trace of my mascara or other make-up
it doesn't strip your skin
i find that this foundation does not strip my skin or make it feel flaky
whenever i switch to another cleanser because i've run out of pureness
i rarely break out
f you have mild irritation on the skin or have a breakout that's healing this will calm
since it's a foam it's not as messy as some oil cleansers can be
i don't remove the mask
i like the fact that you don't rinse the mask off you use a cotton cloth to remove it
it's super difficult to find one that works on combo-oily skin
doesn't matter cus this literally gives me five star spa in tahiti type feels when i put it on
it kind of melts as you rub it into the skin
-somehow-still-glowy finish
doesn't leave me with a oily t-zone by midday
i don't think this would be enough hydration for dryer skin types
it almost feels like condensed water on your skin which might take some getting used to
i enjoy it because it's very easy to apply primer
doesn't clog pores or feel heavy/oily in any way
it's not too much for my oily t-zone
someone with combination or oily skin may think otherwise
that by the time i am putting on coverup it's my skin
i switch around alot when it comes to moisturizers because except for the really expensive ones
then scent does not irritate me in the slightest bit
i wasn't even wearing makeup
the only downside is that while it's on the skin
it's not extreme or uncomfortable
i get little bumps on my forehead that are hard to get rid of sometimes
i just don't think it's much different than using my emu oil in my moisturizer
after one use my skin around my nose did not look nor feel dry
i appreciate the pump (i tend to overuse).
it doesn't seep in too quickly or stick on top of my skin like other products have
does linger for a bit after application
can't tell you guys about the hydrating part
it's almost running out
recommend if you have a lot of acne scars or hyperpigmentation you wanna fix
the smell is like tea, not too overbearing .
in the summer my skin usually does not like oils
it's so clean and fresh.
this doesn't make my face greasy
it's clogging your pores
night without it making my t some more oily
was raving how it doesn't make her feel like an oil slick
unfortunately i have acne prone skin
doesn't feel slick or greasy on the skin
sometimes even with expensive product i brake out in my chin
i don't have more acne
not in a greasy form
it melts right into you skin.
they made my skin feel greasy or never fully absorbed
isn't greasy at all
free of nasty chemicals so you know it's healthy to use
hey my pores are clear so no need for pore strips
it's very easy to apply/wash off
there's some air in the container still
the only issue i found was that after the first use the mask doesn't create the full carbonated/bubbly effect on your face
it was kind of awkward to wash off my whole face of makeup
ive been seeking a deep cleaning cleanser for summer that wouldn't suck the life out of skin
yet gentle cleanser--then this is for you
does not seem oily etc
doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy
it didn't do much for my eyelids
t doesn't cause any break outs like other heavier eye cream do
as makeup doesn't seem to apply well over just the serum
i don't get a lot of sleep and this is a miracle!
it soaks in so fast you don't have to worry about any irritation from using it on the lids
or drink caffeine they do not go away
that was so annoying!
the pour-spout is very small though
i don't even feel the need to double-cleanse!
however if i use a toner my skin is still dirty.
don't feel my skin is clean btw i don't wear makeup
my face isn't irritated after use
so what i usually do is use makeup wipes for make removal
i'd say it's made my eyelashes fuller
i don't have too many lines or wrinkles around my eyes
it's light and easy to spread around.
as soon as you apply it starts bubbling it's cooling refreshing
my lines are fading which weren't too bad
you'll have to use the cuticle stick to dispense the rest of the product
the bags aren't gone
it doesn't soak in quickly
this does not irritate them as most eye creams do
it does seem moisturizing enough for me to do this so far
you don't have to touch the cream with your fingers
my eyes are not irritated by it either
it doesn't sting at all
you can actually wear it under makeup without it interfering with makeup
this one doesn't sting my sensitive eyes
i can't say there are huge changes in the tiny wrinkles at my undereye area
doesn't feel greasy at all
i don't see any difference with the dark circles
no nasties or fragrance in it either!
love that it doesn't contain fragrance.
doesn't leave a slick surface
because it's so light
it doesn't migrate into my eyes or cause my eye makeup
given that it's a little pricey
you can pump out of a needle like syringe exactly what you need so no waste
no play can't be solved with a cream
the good part is i can get away with light concealer
still looks natural- as the thick stuff never does
doesn't irritate my eyes like some other products have in the past
it's too long/tall
a little puffiness on days when i get less sleep or cry
doesn't take anytime to start bubbling
this helps keep me less oily before puttin on my makeup
the only thing is you will need moisturizer afterwards
it's not really a mask in the traditional sense
it's gentle on the skin but really cleans it.
the bubbles don't hurt but tickle :)
no burning, as i often get from all face mask.
it's not hydrating so don't know how this would do on really dry skin
the pep start double bubble purifying mask doesn't give you much in terms of exfoliation
i like this bubble mask a lot
it actually tickles a bit.
i've always steered clear of any cleanser that foams/suds because i always break out
it does remove all my makeup
it's still really gentle
because it's a little difficult to put the cleanser gel on one h
find it to be enough for my skin as a night cleanse especially in the summer
i don't find it to be stripping or irritating
when i travel it'll leak i'm sure
it's inevitable it gets close to my eyes
it doesn't over dry like i noticed with both of the de bar cleansers
i don't use it to take off my eye makeup
can't speak to whether or not it irritates eyes or takes off eye makeup
it didn't feel like stripped my skin even though i used it with my foreo luna mini
mind you sometimes i do a heavy face
f you're sensitive to certain smells this might not be for you
they're definite hg's for me
i've had no issues with package leakage--you just have to make sure you screw the cap on snugly
have to keep it on it's side
maybe good forthose who don't like using de soap cleansers
people saying it's drying i have no clue what cleanser you're using because this is not drying
those of you saying it doesn't remove your makeup may well
you're supposed to remove your makeup before you cleanse anyway
is ridiculous because if the cleanser could take all that off it would be too stripping
it doesn't leak if you tighten it enough
it's hard to call any cleanser amazing because as long as it cleanses well
i mean even the mascara that i always think i get with other cleansers
when i look at myself there's still black smears under my eyes
it doesn't sting my eyes at all
i prefer it to the bars because i can use it in the shower
packaging is ok- you twist the cap
i tend get oily throughout the day so this give me nice clean
doesn't leave my skin feeling dry nor does it sting my eyes
i think any cleanser would irritate your eyes if you get it in them
sometimes i use the babyfacial after
i probably would stick the soaps as i love them.
it's simple enough to wipe the excess drip that come out after closing the bottle
a little bit does squirt out when you are closing it
didn't have the time or energy to do my usual double cleanse
didn't leave my skin feeling tight
for the people that are comaplaining it burns their guys its a cleanser for your face your not suppost to get it in your eyes or to take off makeup so don't be dumb
it's not drying for me
i didn't have any issues with burning my eyes or skin
i know fragrance in skin care isn't good
takes off all my makeup too.
i didn't even use my micellar water to remove eye makeup beforeh
i love that it has the marula oil in it too.
i like it in general because it is not foamy
i didn't scrub it
perfect for those who are lazy about washing your face
it's so easy to use and my skin feels so fresh!
i don't have any problems usually with my combination skin
i usually dont find a cleanser that leaves my skin feeling good right after
my skin doesn't get super dry either
i can't speak to it reducing my redness
i don't use it to take off my makeup
they're not like the annoying plastic ones
it's really mild and not harsh.
my face has quite literally never felt so squeaky clean
the beads in the stick don't bother me or stick around like some people's reviews
cheeks all you have to do is splash your face after
it instantly gives a nice deep cleanse so you don't need to use a lot of product either
the stick form makes it super easy to use
it is really refreshing after cleaning my makeup off
it's super easy to use
i don't have to worry about product leaking which is a plus
it doesn't completely dry you out
because i loved the toner so much i figured that i would pick up the cleanser too
it's just my skin
it doesn't dry out my skin like other cleansers have
it's easy to use it as a scrub
i don't find it a hassle to wash my face in the morning anymore
don't have to worry about it leaking
the only downside is that i tend to find the exfoliants everywhere after i wash my face- in my hair
brightens up that under eye area just enough for me to not want to purchase concealer
almost has a rigid feel that can't kind of be uncomfortable
it might be wishful thinking
the he'll is cool to the touch
clay doesn't usually do too much for my skin
wait until they're dried
on top of everything the packaging is so cute
i do masks every night.
so far tarte mask has actually helped with my breakouts
don't know about this lifting skin
the exfoliating mask didn't really have much of an effect on me
and the mask actually works.
yes enough to peel it off
you are only going to get 2 masks out of this tube
now when you peel it off it does feel like it's taking any hair you have off too
it's a really nice peel off mask
it's true that's it pretty much deluxe sample size
i didn't think it was itchy or burned like some of the other reviewers
when glam glow released this limited time mask i thought i should try it out
this ones in such a cute package/squeeze bottle
its not burn your face off type burn
you know its time to peel it off
yes it does peel off.
it's lightweight enough that i don't feel like i have product dripping down my face in the summer humidity
i can't even begin to express how it's helped reduce the dark sun spots on my forehead
it doesn't feel greasy or heavy like most lotions do when applied
if you want a lotion like actually smells like it claims to be scented
if you're into smells go buy a perfume cuz masks are not here to please your nose
it tingled my skin a bit but didn't irritate it.
this one doesn't tingle
only give 4 stars because it's so expensive.
don't over use it, you'll mess up your skin.
when i first apply this mask i didn't realize that you have to put such a thick layer
rather it remains a little tacky / sticky so just fyi
i did plenty of peels before
due to their size it's important to don't go into crazy scrubbing mode
because i can tell that i removed a layer of my skin
this mask doesn't completely close them
i can't describe the smell
number one it's just such a cool idea
gets a good amount of grime out of your face
it's fun to roll all over your face
it kind of burned because i am used to more gentle masks
i sometimes just even use it as a cleanser.
it's fun to use, not messy.
love the easy use, doesn't dry out skin, very fun
it does leave a texture on my skin that reminds me of some bar soaps i have tried
i hate taking off my makeup, it's a chore.
this jelly ball did not disappoint
doesn't leave a residue like some charcoal cleansers do
it doesn't have a strong smell to it like other charcoal masks
my normal cleanser just wasn't strong enough to combat it
don't have to worry about liquids on the plane
it doesn't have an overwhelming scent
pluses:- cleanse well the skin- doesn't leave any greasy feeling on the skin
i don't think i'd use it for everyday take my makeup off
i just use a makeup remover to take off my makeup
tbh it doesn't remove waterproof eye makeup or liquid lipstick
are you even cleansing??
really like the texture of the ball it's really fun to squish
it's not just a bar of soap--the squishy texture is awesome
i definitely have a "squeaky clean" feeling after using
my combination skin is not irritated by it
even my water proof mascara it comes right off!
some find it gimmicky
how it's working for my skin
it takes all my makeup off so easily i don't even use makeup wipes removers anymore
all you do is wet your face
it makes me think it's breaking down the acid mantle on my skin
for my skin type
i've never had a cleanser that left me with a smooth skin like this one does
like don't let it dissolve under running water
it's so good at removing makeup
it doesn't make me overly dry like other charcoal cleansers
i normally take my makeup off before i wash my face because i find it too hard to get all my eye makeup off with a liquid cleanser
doesn't strip my skin
you don't lose a bunch of product
it doesn't irratate your eyes
it's a jelly ball so obviously it's gonna be a little difficult to rub all over your face
if you grip it in your palm then you're good to go
it's such a good cleanser that i don't mind much
this ball works better than any makeup remover wipes i've ever tried
it will definitely save me so much money from buying makeup remover wipes all the time
by the end of the day i need a good makeup remover
this little sucker makes taking my makeup off
cleaning my face so simple
even after a few washes it still doesn't completely remove everything
leaves my skin feeling nice-- not tight or feeling like there's residue
i also like how this cleanser doesn't leave a film on your face
doesn't leave your skin feeling tight
unlike most cleansers it leaves you with a real deep clean feeling
get a great lather to put on your face it is very cleansing which in turn some people can think is drying
wasn't messy at all
the jelly ball is a good decent size for the price you pay so you're not overpaying either
sometimes that might be annoying
i always use a makeup-remover towel after cleansing so that didn't bother me
i really was expecting this to have light soapy bubbles
does not leave my skin super tight after
of course if you want a deep cleansing you should rub the jelly in your h
it definitely doesn't get my skin as clean as i'd like
careful if your nails are long
it feels great in the skin although a little thrown of because it's a squishy ball
tend to be a little irritating to my skin
i like how it doesn't harden completely
that it really does feel like it's exfoliating
i don't see myself using it as often as the blue or purple mask
it doesn't bug me
i did feel a burning sensation
didn't bother my sensitive dry skin whatsoever
they're also great if you're on a budget because you can get 4 uses out of each pouch
sometimes you want to change it up
give it a try...a must for mask junkies like me!
you get quick results
i wanted a clay mask that is cheap and works.
it's cheap and a good find.
was paranoid it was going to clog my pores or break me out
there's enough in the packet for 3-4 applications
it doesn't harden all the way but it super nice.
that makes it very easy to rub around the tiny beads when it's time to wash it off
it doesn't completely dry so when you take it off your face feels so dang good
i am someone who probably over-exfoliates
i suddenly did not feel the need to exfoliate in the mornings when i usually do
this didn't irritate my skin
it's not as rough as the frixxton stick by tarte which is a plus for me
once you add water it also makes a nice amount of bubbles
even when i am wearing makeup
doesn't feel as heavy in texture to the rose one from fresh
does not feel heavy on the skin
i wouldn't say it's the heaviest moisturizer i've used
not leaving me slick
know it's the cream
am not only obsessed with the scent
to see how long the fragrance lasts on you
can't wait to use it with the vibrancy mask
i love the little spoon too!
my skin breaks out if i use anything too heavy
not only is this texture light
my skin at night isn't greasy or tacky when i use this
t doesn't end up on your pillow
it doesn't cause my skin to feel oily
when i open mine there's usually a liquidy layer on top
i don't consider my skin to be glowy in the morning
i credit this product because it's the only change to my routine
i will say that the spoon that comes with it so everything can be sanitary does make it a bit difficult to get the product out because it's so slippery
the smell doesn't linger for too long which is nice
the little spoon is hard to use
plus it works while you sleep so no excuses for being lazy
my advice is actually use the little spoon.
it feels like such a treat for your skin.
the smell isn't for me
don't forget to wear sunscreen if you're going to be outside after using this mask
as far as i'm concerned there's some kind of sorcery in that little pink container
it's liquidy but gel like.
it feels kind of slimy at first.
smooth skin is what this mask will give you
the tiny spatula ensures you won't use more than you need
must get if you need moisture in your skin!
the mask was a little tacky after putting it on
i didn't notice any piling or little balls forming on my face or shedding off like the other reviewers
so this is what is making your skin smooth.
i did have a small zit form
that's pretty normal when using chemical exfoliants you guys
sadly i lost the little plastic spoon that it comes with
it doesn't really absorb
it's still cool i'm not mad
it didn't irritate my skin at all
it won't be all over your pillow
it even comes with a little spoon
don't have to get my nails all gross
it's so smooth feeling!
you do have to keep your face off your pillow for a bit while it really sinks in
leaving bad reviews on a product you haven't even used
it's in heavy rotation for me right now
the things i dislike are the jar packaging
the smell is just a plus
make sure to use sunscreen with this as it can make your skin a little sensitive
you should always wear sunscreen anyway
it's been sold out for some time and it's crazy!
you can look a little greasy
it helps if you press it into your skin with the palms of your h
so don't look or feel oily
or feel like it'll get all over your pillow
my skin goes berserk whenever there's a change in the weather
so get yourself a jar when you can!
as long as you do not mind the slightly cloying smell of sugared watermelon--this stuff works
the product does not leave a greasy residue
maybe a body splash or so.
for someone who doesn't have the patience to deal with it as a sleeping mask
only drawback is that the little spatula that's enclosed isn't really worth much
it isn't artificial in any way
it looks so cute on my vanity.
normally i don't like sleep masks because i hate the feeling of it just sitting on my face
it sinks into the skin enough so that i can't feel it rather quickly
it doesn't transfer to my pillows
luckily the smell doesn't stay tho so you can sleep
definitely wouldn't recommend to someone who doesn't like heavily scented products
the mask doesn't make my skin peel as i've heard it has others
there's still a layer of mask on my face
which tells me it didn't rub off on the pillow
i wouldn't use this during the day because it'd be too hydrating
it's great for night use because that's when your skin is repairing
it doesn't make me oily throughout the day
yes it does have a sour smell to it
it doesn't burn when using it
it doesn't leave my skin greasy
it kind of gets itchy
i get the odd tiny bump not acne.
notice that i don't have to exfoliate as often
it looks like a bad contour application
this blown me out that never irritates my skin at all
you only need a small amount or you'll be rinsing it off forever
just a pea sized amount will cleanse your entire face so deeply that it purges your skin
the nice thing about this is that it doesn't leave my skin feeling dry or stripped after using it
because it doesn't leave you with a tight
is one of few cleansers that say you can use it over the eyes
did not burn/irritate my eyes or my skin
my face doesn't have that over tight feeling cleansers can give you especially at night after washing off makeup
yes it's pricy however you pay for the quality without the fillers other "high-end" br
that's cool because you don't have to exfoliate your skin later in the week because the face mask do the job for you
you feel your skin is out of whack
you will love the way your skin feels after washing your face
it doesn’t foam/lather up too much
as it does not take off makeup super well
then i lather a bit more
it does not strip the skin at all
it's easy to see that they aren't healthier than this one
this for sure doesn't cause acne
i don't have constantly bad acne anymore.
t's not greasy on my skin
i do this at night because the hope in a jar tends to have a smell
so i wear it only at night under my moisturizer.
feels like it's firmer
creams are usually an instant hit or miss for me
i still need to wax just as often.
doesn't make me breakout and fades my acne marks.
it does something to your skin overnight
it is not greasy
nor does it feel like it sits on top of my skin like some serums do
not greasy at all and can wear day and night.
really bright dont know if helps yet to prevent/minimize wrinkles or with firming
the only thing i could use on my face was coconut oil
is not greasy at all
i don't suffer from acne
i can't speak for the anti aging qualities because i'm still young
it's perfect for those who are getting into anti aging skin care
or not use at all on days of irritated skin
the peptides can't hurt either!
doesn't seem to clog pores
not overwhelming or perfume-like
i don't like the smell of it
i like that it isn't too oily to give me whiteheads or whatever it is that comes up when my skin gets greasy
no joke- it reeks!
i guess i didn't realize it would be a liquid because it comes out of the dropper onto your finger like a gel
it's all thanks to my philosophy skin care routine because i smoke
it lasts months as long as my boyfriend doesn't get into it
philosophy's "when hope is not enough" glides on easily
i love how it's not oily.
it just seems to sink in my skin
doesn't take much on your fingertips to gently tap on your face
it doesn't linger like a scent
we'll see about anti-wrinkle as time goes on.
its pretty icky when you first apply
when hope is not enough smoothes out the fine lines
the smell of this product doesn't really bother me because one i apply my moisturizer
now i don't have to wear a turtleneck all the time
do not have many many skin concerns other than oily acne prones skin
my makeup lasts all day
it's kind of expensive to be water
make up since it's not greasy
i didn't until they started to soften lol
it's literally changed my skin
this is not sticky was so ever
doesn't just sit on top of your skin like a typical mask
doesn't feel too thick
it just gives my skin a little extra umph when it's looking dull
i love the consistency of the product as doesn't feel too oily/greasy when i put it on my face
does seem to soak in quickly
performance confuse me when it's being called a night mask
in fact not quite as thick as regular face cream
it doesn't make me oily or dried out
i like this mask enough to use it as the top layer of whatever serums i'm using
this mask makes me wake up with a legit glow.
my skin breaks out for no reason
this stuff nourishes my skin so much
it won't get all over your pillow
it's so cooling and refreshing on the skin.
it is so light weight and not sticky.
or you just don't drink water
i can't stop touching my face with how soft
that i have using for years all the products are perfect for delicate skin so don't think twice before buying it you won't regret it
it doesn't feel oily on the face
it's still one of my fave masks
my skin doesn't feel dull
it actually feels like there's moisture in my skin
it doesn't clog up my pores
doesn't matter i drink 1l of water per day
i often bite my lips when i get stressed out
i find that using it means i can wear a drying lip product the next day without needing to wear a balm underneath
i never considered spending anything on my lips for hydration as i stick to chapstick
that usually does it
if you wear this at night it will smear off if you sleep on your side because you'll probably rub your face into the pillow
treatments only work when they're on
make your lips worse when they're not
that's the last thing i want from a lip treatment
so you don't have to dig your fingers in there at all
amazing lip mask that you pay for some junky chapstick
the bite beauty mask thru the day when i am not wearing lipstick
if you don't like the thick greasy feeling of aquaphor or vaseline this is for you
in fact my lips just look
i don't just wear it at night like many other reviewer's i do sometimes put a slight coating over my lips during the day
i no longer feel the need to bite the little skins off or have to exfoliate my lips as much as i did before
chapped at a ridiculous speed
there's still a little bit left on your lips
it makes lipstick apply nicer
no matter how much matte liquid lipstick abuse i've done to my lips the day before
i can see this tub lasting me a while.
the texture is like a heavy chap stick that doesn't budge
doesn't move around on the lips
i know this is for your lips
my lips are never cracked or peeling anymore
it does not make me break out around my mouth as some heavy lip products do
can't wait to use it in the winter
it's sticky if you use too much
this mask is everything
plumps them like nothing else
they would sometimes chap or lose their color
my lips are always so fry that lip balm wasnt helping anymore
it doesn't smell or taste bad either which are all pluses in my book
and the spatula is just too cute!
the jar is big and lasts long on your lips.
in the whole realm of the world decided living with flaky lips is not the worse thing
doesn't soak in or slip off too quick
the little baby spatula is too cute
if you suffer from dry lips or just enjoy sleeping with a balm on at night you need this stuff
i always try new balms or lip treatments because i'm completely addicted to them
while i do enjoy the bite mask
it doesn't leave any sort of milky cast on your lips like some treatments do
i didn't find this too sticky to wear during the day
the only con i will say when it comes to using it during the day as a balm is that it can become very slightly sticky as it wears off
i also don't notice much of a flavor to it
i find myself licking my lips too much if a product has a nice flavor
there were times where even layering a bunch of lip treatments would not help
it did completely get rid of my lip problem
don't have to use my nails
the tiniest amount makes your lips feel br
my lips are always peeling because i lick them so much all year round
means you don't have to dip your finger into the pot
it's really a huge size pot for a lip mask.
i figured if anything it would make a great lip balm
they often get to the point that i peel the skin right off of my lips because it drives me crazy
i will even use this during the day as a lip balm i love it so much
i don't have a lot of product left to remove
i love matte lippies but my lips suffer bad.
my lips tend to chap or get flaky easily
they don't help with the patches
i always rationalized that it was just another lip balm that wouldn't work for my dry flaky lips
at first i wasn't in love with the consistency as it is a bit sticky in my opinion
my lips couldn't live without it
can't you just use some burts bees?
gets your lips in the best condition therefore as pouty as possible
etc even though i don't help matters by biting my lips
have tried so many kind of lips balm or chapstick
i don't even need to apply any kind of lips balm
i do find that if i apply too much it melts
it's not sticky once it gets absorbed in your lips
every time i use it i notice my lips just getting softer
i would gladly buy this lip mask again
it's thick enough that it truly doesn't move around at night
doesn't have a strong taste
i just love how non greasy or sticky this stuff is
no matter how hydrated i stay or what lip products i used
it's lightweight and not really oily.
it truly moisturises you lips so that even hours after the product is gone
i love it so much i use it as my regular daytime lip balm
the spatula that comes with the product is super cute :
you can even use it as a chapstick
the non greasy feel
you need a good plastic surgeon for that
it isn't oily which i hate have oil on my face
doesn't affect the longevity of my makeup
because it's the summer
i can't tell if it's the product or the weather that makes my skin a little more oily than usual
you'll have to apply a sunblock with it.
it's a thicker looking consistency
doesn't clog my pores
it's a great gel that you can put on to help hydrate your skin
it's light and doesn't feel heavy.
i am obsessed wit how hydrating it is yet it can be applied before makeup without the think feeling of an oil moisturizer
it doesn't feel oily or sticky at all
it's not too thin but its neither too thick.
i don't have to worry about being too oily or flaky
i did not feel oily after use
it really melts into the skin
normally i try to get away from any type of gel-feeling moisturizers just because i need something more intense
my skin was mosturized all day without being oily which is something i struggle to find the balance with
there isn't any spf in it for day time wear
doesn't feel sticky or anything
it's a bit tacky at first
it's not too bad once it dries
it's a pretty thick consistency
the cheap feel of the kid just doesn't match the elegance of the glass jar to me
i would not wear this cream under my makeup
i did not find it to be overpowering while the moisturizer was on my face
this lotion makes you feel like you're treating your face right
definitely more oily in the summertime
is not at all greasy
oily skin + i live at the beach + it's summer time = hot mess
it gives you the perfect amount of moisture without the greasy feeling or look
i think it lingers on the skin
tend to get oily on my t-zone
it doesn't irritate my sometimes sensitive skin either
it doesn't have an over powering scent which is a nice change
not sticky and nice under makeup.
i am always skeptical of moisturizers because i don't want my skin to get oily
not too thick to where it would clog your pores
it is light enough to wear day
it's like my skin just drinks it up
my skin would get so greasy throughout the day
it doesn't leave a greasy feel or obnoxious shine
what i also love about it is that the creme is not heavy
it does not stick around so even if you are sensitive to scents
i can't praise this cream enough
is not sticky at all
i personally have normal to oily skin so this would leave me too shiny if i used it in the morning
definitely not an every day moisturizer for my skin type which is oily
doesn't irritate my skin at all
doesn't look or feel oily or smell strange
the only complaint i have is that it kinda makes my powder foundation look a little cakey
it is not overpowering
once the skin absorbs it does not feel almost
it doesn't leave your skin sticky
did not feel or appear oily at all
at the same time i have really oily tzone
i doesn't leave my skin oily
i absolutely love how it comes with a mini spatula to scoop out your product in
it's too thick for me to use as a day cream
or maybe as a winter cream
doesn't clog up my nose
this makes my face look so moisturizer without being too thick or tacky
it really melts into the skin
which is something i can't say for the other creams i have tried for my dry skin
she refers to it as "it's like watering a plant
my skin doesn't feel greasy or weighed down when i put it on
it's not sticky at all
flaky i dont believe this will be enough moister for your skin
it doesn't make the flakiness go away completely
my mineral makeup doesn't flake away like it used to
lightweight moisturizer that doesn't break me out is usually a struggle
doesn't turn oily/greasy after it's applied
i love that it comes with an applicator stick so you do not have to stick your fingers into the jar
i promise you this will change the way you look at moisturizers
i do not appreciate moisturizers that leave me feeling greasy
didnt want to turn into an oil slick
its hard to find something that doesn't make my skin oily
that it doesn't make my face feel masked with product after applying both the cream
it doesn't feel heavy on my skin
it doesn't leave a weird film or tacky feeling on the skin
the formula is more like a gel that doesn't make the skin oily
the only thing i don't like the the fragrance in it
the cream itself has a cushy synthetic feel to it that is really nice
one note about this product is that applying makeup afterwards can be tacky feeling
so not slick on my face
when you put it on your face it seems to just melt into your skin with an extradorinaiy amount of moisture
i am always weary of trying new moisturizers because i don't like my face to feel greasy
my face didn't feel greasy whatsoever!
this cream does make my t-zone oilier.
i gave it a 4 stars because i only use it at night because it is tacky
this doesn't irritate me at all
i swear i can feel all the gunk coming out of my pores
the term "oil cleanser" seemed oxymoronic
would always see a hint of residual make up on the cotton pad
i love this cleanser because it form up when you message your face with a little water
its will exfoliate your skin because you can feel a little beads rubbing around your skill before it forms up
nothing beats this cleanser for me!!
doesn't make your skin feel dried out or tight
it doesn't irritate my skin
not greasy at all
it doesn't have much of a scent
apparently it's recommended for oily skin since it's so lightweight
yeah i guess the magnetic spatula is smart
hate everything made with glass
it doesn't break me out or leave me oily
not sticky and doesn't leave a residue.
honestly left a sticky residue that i wasn't too fond of
i am pretty neurotic about trying new things
it's so light and long lasting.
a then a ton of extracts before the stuff at the bottom that's a bit more questionable
is not greasy in the slightest
though most mornings/nights i can't be bothered with the metal spatula it come with
there is zero film or greasiness.
doesn't clog your pores and no reactions.
light enough to keep my t-zone oil free
i am always reluctant to try anything "lightweight" because inevitably my skin starts peeling
doesn't make it clump or slide off
for years i've tried to find a moisturizer that would give the nourishment my skin needed without making me look like a greaseball by the end of the day
really sinks into my skin like a cream
i think it's really helping me with my excess oil
it's not producing as much sebum
even though it's so lightweight
nothing else in my cleansing or makeup routine changed
my skin dies not only gets softer
it's the perfect mask to use during a bubble bath
let's start off my mentioning that i own practically every high end mask that sephora caries
it's super easy and smooth to apply.
it has little to no scent with a very satisfying texture that is easy to wash away with no residue or need to use a cloth
this mask did wonders for my skin!
i generally don't feel like masks do anything.
it's a clay-like consistency
it definitely didn't get rid of my acne
typically i don't like masks.
i love that this mask doesn't leave my skin dry or tight like many masks do
i can't quit this mask.
then don't buy those masks
not as thick as i thought it'd be, which i like.
so unless it begins any irritation
it may not give your skin ridiculous instant harsh results
i can't put my finger on the smell
i didn't feel dried out
i didn't have any stubborn patches i had to rub out
it has just enough coverage to even my skin without feeling like i need to wear makeup for pool days
it also doesn't make my face feel oily
it does not clog my pores
it does even out my complexion
a little bit of blush for my daytime face routine
i don't find it to be too glow-y at all
it's kind of a baffling product, really!
it's kind of on the expensive side
found that every eye cream i used before this was too rich for my skin
i don't have dark circles
sinks in great before you apply your makeup
if you use the proper amount it's still more lightweight than most tinted moisturizers
i hope they come out with more shades so ladies with dark skin can enjoy the product
it's not too thick
it doesn't sink into my pores or lines
it still looks natural -- it does not get cakey or mask-like on me
glossier also wiped off extremely easy as well because it just kind if sits on your skin because it's
i like that they didn't include fragrance as an ingredient
now i know it's on the expensive side
what i didn't like was the fact it's a "duo/double" serum
didn't leave my skin greasy even though i have an oily type of skin
whenever i get facial items i get nervous because they sometimes dont work amd or break me out
do not have issues with wrinkles or lines
i didn't know if it cause me to have small breakouts in my forehead which i usually don't have or probably i'm just stress from work
i also didn't mind the viscosity because i have pretty dry skin that doesn't break out
i don't know that it's supposed to clear your skin up from blemishes
i do not have any signs of loose skin
'm sure the normal bottle is 100x easier to retreive the products contents
not any more after only using it fur 10 days.
after 7 days trying this product i can see a texture
it's not a cream at all it's oil.
i usually notice this after a mask
so i want afraid of the light oily feel.
citrus did not irritate
oily skin did not break me out
i really liked that it wasn't a thick heavy cream
with that being said the consistency is great it's not too oily or sticky it's semi lightweight as well
it does not leave a oily finish which i love
it does not feel like it is clogging your pores which is always a plus
can't attest to the anti-aging
i don't have fine lines or wrinkles yet
don't usually take well to oils
don't really have any lines or wrinkles that i needed to hide
it's hard to squeeze it out into your h
it does go on a bit oily
not greasy to have on at night
i would not recommend it if you already have oily skin
can't attest to that quality of the product
the texture of this product is a little oily though so beware
it does feel oily when you apply it
i truly recommend this product to those with a combination of skin whether it's oily or dry or a mix of both
doesn't make my skin feel greasy like some others would
it doesn't have a strong scent
it didn't leave my face oily either which is great
doesn't feel greasy in the meantime or after
it's like perfume for my face with extra benefits of making my skin better
the texture of the serum is also great because it doesn't leave behind a sticky residue
the fragrance might be annoying for some
it doesn't go on too oily or slimy
i don't think it's effective
which means sometimes my fine lines
but it doesn't linger.
may seem a bit greasy at first
it doesn't sting, burn or cause any irritation.
i don't even feel the need to moisturize with this product
the scent relaxes me so much that it's perfect to use before bed
this moisturizer does not make me look more oily
i would say it's like liquid gold in a bottle.
doesn’t feel greasy or heavy
it's even helped with my closed comedones.
doesn't leave my skin overly dry like some other spot treatments i've tried
it will burn your skin.
it's amazing and it shrinks them down so fast!
realize that a pimple is inconveniently trying to ruin your photo opportunities
my face does not look dull
i definitely recommend this to anyone with oily skin
the title says it all: i never thought i'd find a gel mask that i love for my oily/combo skin
my pores tend to just hold onto anything too goopy
doesn't hurt my skin at all
the fact that it doesn't harden
recently i have been too lazy to apply all my usually layers of skincare needed to keep my skin plump
really packs a punch when i mix this with a few drops of any facial oil i use
i like that it's matte
doesn't strip my skin
this stuff removes makeup so well.
it does foam without water like the description says
deal with redness: i don't find this mask to be irritating
i can feel it purging my skin
this is the only mask i have ever used that clears out my blackheads
do yourself a favor and try this mask!
if you've been living with blackheads for years
especially since it's made for all skin types
this doesn't irritate it at all
good skin care under your makeup sets the canvas for how your foundation lies
there are no bad smells
i look more glowy after i use it.
it's a mini vacation for your face.
it's important to take care of your skin
i mean like a super hot
t doesn't irritate or break out my skin
they really help get that extra clean your skin needs sometimes
i don’t need to use pore-filling primers anymore after i used this
the old blemishes seem to lighten
so you don't have to scrub at your face
and when i say oily i'm not exaggerating.
don't make me greasy
doesn't linger upon application
it's not at all greasy.
i can use this at night too because it provides plenty of moisture
doesn't make my face feel like its covered in moisturizer
is not greasy whatsoever
not greasy at all
even when i wear a bit of makeup
wouldn't feel overly greasy or melted
flaky to the point that it makes wearing high coverage foundations really impossible
i’ve read that not only does it promises to moisturize
this moisturizer doesn't irritate at all
thanks to this mattifying mist i no longer need to hoard them
doesn't feel heavy or irritate skin
this product doesn't leave your skin feeling dry after you've applied it like other moisturizers ive used
a little product does go a long way so you don't need to lather yourself in it
let it completely soak in to your skin or your makeup will slip
almost like a makeup primer
not at all heavy or greasy.
always forget to pack my primer
i love how smooth this applies with no greasy residue
also serves as a great primer for under the eyes so makeup doesn't settle in the creases
i love that it's gel formula instead of cream
you will notice less lines under your eyes
i love how easily my makeup glides over it
it's a gel like consistency
let me tell you this eye gel is where it's at!
pop this in your fridge
yet light enough to use underneath my makeup so my concealer goes on smoothly
i don't like a jar for my skin care
this really blurs your fine lines
if you're worried about some eye creams being too heavy
what i like is that the product is not sticky or flaky
it isn't greasy at all
they are not puffy or tired looking anymore
this is what my skin craves1
it comes in a cute little glass jar easy for storing
helix eye gel is another great volition product that doesn't disappoint
it doesn't have a smell to it
there wasn't a bad odor like i have found with many moisturizers
didn't feel tacky or greasy
am so picky with face moisturizers when it comes to consistency
it is not greasy, does not leave white streaks.
i either break out or it doesn't hydrate my skin
the best part it doesn't leave my skin oily
sometimes i even add 1 drop of this to my day cream
i quite literally haven't had a pimple in 6 months
i don't feel oily at all
i also love this product it's like they say "magic in a bottle" it makes my skin plumped
my eye area could use extra tlc than just a moisturizer does
didn't do much to repair the flakiness
because this cream wont cure dryness around the eyes
dont expect it to be an anti aging cream
it's thick enough that it doesn't feel like it dries right away
this stuff has been heaven on my raw skin
it wont make a huge difference in your eyes if you have problem areas such as wrinkles or extreme dark circles
and it is not heavy at all!
doesn't cause your skin or makeup to crease
it also doesn't slide around
it's pretty thick doesn't smell too strong
i like that it's like a mud
doesn't dry you out like other masks.
used to have oily skin until i learned to take care of it
doesn't have much or a smell.
possibly one of the only sunscreens that doesn't break me out
it is a bit greasy
it's hard to find a moisturizer to work with my skin type that doesn't leave me greasy or oily
it doesn't feel sticky like regular sunscreen
it doesn't strip your face
no matter how much i gently scrub it off
this stuff is great at cleansing without stripping your skin
i actually have a very bad sunburn on my face right now
it's perfect for combo skin because it removes all the oil without making your skin feel squeaky or tight
otherwise it'll take some effort to rinse it off
was hesitant to use it because my skin tends to break out with creams
although it does dry your skin a little so maybe not for dryer types
i like to use this mask for both no-makeup
it is not super intense so you can feel it nourishing your skin without gimmicky chemicals or stinging
if you're in your 30's or older
i don't have dark circles
it is not greasy
packed so you don't have to dip your finger in a all the time
it's a constant battle so while this stuff is pricey- it does what it says it does
you almost feel like you've just got a facial each time you cleanse
4 stars only because it doesn't take off makeup.
i adore that because i like sometimes to go out without make up
it's so gentle and has never broken my skin out.
sometimes i'm even so lazy that i remove my makeup with this then just wipe off excess with a micellar wipe instead of using my clarisonic
all that stuff to cleanse
does a good job at cleaning out your pores
there's never a muddy mask can do this!
i can even wear it on its own for flawless looking bare skin
does not cause irritation or breakouts
it doesn't just sit on the skin the way a lot of heavy creams do
it does feel like it forms a film on your face
was on it's way to healing
if i have blemishes or any skin texture this stuff clears it up in less than 2 days
if i use a mattifying anything
it did make a huge difference on my flaky skin
my skin was going through it after not being on hormonal birth control anymore
it does even my skin's texture
everyone's skin is different
ready for make up without any popping of pimples lol
it minimizes my acne over night even though it doesn't claim to
this product has changed my skin completely it's helping to get rid of my scars as well
i cannot get over the smell
it is just so unappealing
i guess you could if your skin is super dry
it works wonder on my milia
this stuff is literally a miracle in a bottle
my skin used to be so red that i couldn't even see my natural color
it doesn't feel heavy on the face
it's a great light moisturiser though even if you're the oily/combo type
i literally break out so easy
it does wonders on dark spots
my nose does not get so many whiteheads
my first impression of this product is that it's sticky
"there's no way this is good for my skin because of how sticky it is
it made my skin sting so bad i had to wash it off
i never feel any burning with this product or the balling effect others have described
i still got a stray pimple here
if you don't have pimples this is a dream
or if your pimples aren't as stubborn
it doesn't transfer to my pillow case
some which even concealer wouldn't cover up
if you suffer from acne
so can make your skin thinner
i like to think that it's working to get rid of my blemishes
right now my focus doesn't include wrinkles
it can sting if you have a blemish
which it didn't get rid of entirely
it goes on feeling a little tacky
like you are putting vinegar on your face.
i would recommend this to literally anyone who struggles with any sort of texture or dryness
this stuff clears up my "allergy" rash when nothing else
not vomit inducing but not pleasant.
not quite a burn but a little tingling.
also, don't let my usage of "thick" scare you.
you also can't smell the scent once it's on which i appreciate
can use day and night, because no spf.
t doesn't leave me greasy or oily
i love the thick consistency it has to it because once you apply it
the whiteheads are hardly a problem because they're so small
i like it because it's simple
like it's made out of cheap plastic
i don't think it's thick enough for a night cream
sometimes i use it as a primer
i always have some around- it's an absolute staple of my beauty routine
it might be the reason of a question i have been long wondering: where did the pink stain on my navy pajama come from?
although others don't care for the fragrance in some of the oh creams
the creamsicle fragrance in this one not so much
what i dislike is that my face seems more oily at night after a day of wearing
it's a little hard to find sometimes
whenever it's in stock i buy it
really itchy skin that no other moisturizer seemed to help with
it's nice and thick, but not greasy at all.
this stuff works so well when my skin is super oily
was worried the scent might irritate it
typically when a product smells i don't bother giving it a second thought
to the point my skin would be flakey
so my makeup would apply horribly.
your skin will love it
it's not too heavy for me
i couldn't resist the amazing smell
i don't break out often
because many break me out or cause allergic reactions
it takes away the flakiness
my skin doesn't soak it up.
it does not help with my rosacea.
doesn't make me feel like i have too much "goop" on my face
i don't mind the smell
not greasy at all
absorbs into your skin so there is not thin layer still sitting on your face like other moisturizers
nothing get rid of the dryness like this does
i don't find that it makes me more oily
yes, i am sort of shiny looking after i use this.
it's super rich, almost like a balm.
simply because my skin is so red
the one i normally can't use during the day because it's so heavy
it doesn't break me out and it smells amazing.
make it part of your skin care routine.
flaky skin that was in such a bad state
this seems like a weird way to describe a moisturizer
so hydrating, yet doesn't feel heavy!
if you normally use sheer transformation
not to mention doesn't irritate or worsen my psoriasis
though it's sort of rich
it doesn't linger too long
it's smooth and actually smells good!
this doesn't break me out or make me oily
it does not make me oily throughout the day
there's something about it which feels a little like its leaving a slight film on the surface of my skin
to say it melts in to your skin is an understatement
the smell is just a plus!
it did not burn or caused me to peel.
i do remove makeup with oil beforeh
it doesn't irritate or dry out my skin or break me out
this cleanser does not require a lot of product
doesn't leave skin tight or uncomfortable
doesn't suck all the life out of my skin
doesn't dry me out or irritate me.
it gets makeup off my face like no other cleanser
other than that it's perfect
it removes any remaining makeup your makeup wipes didn't get
makes me want to wash my face with gusto.
it didn't strip my face
it doesn't take off make up
for the price of this cleanser i can't beat it
it's so refreshing that i feel like i've been to a spa at home in my shower
my combi skin can't decide if it wants to be oily or dry
i just seem to crave a facial wash like this one
doesn't leave my skin tight
it does not strip the skin
it does take off makeup
one thing people dont get is that this is free of sulfates that's why there's not to much of a lather
it doesn't leave any residue
it doesn't lather as much as other cleansers
doesnt do much if you are acne prone
so used to buy "acne cleansers" because i thought i needed to get my skin as clean as possible
then i started hearing all this stuff about how even if you have oily skin
other cleansers so my skin doesn't get so used to it
the bottle lasts me forever
it's non-drying but gets my skin really clean.
does not strip your skin
before using it, my skin was so dull.
doesn't dry your skin out like so many acne washes do
because i prefer a cleanser which i can lather up myself
what i like is that it does not leave your skin dry like other cleansers
i love the "on the go cleanser" except for the smell
masks just would not get rid of them
it's pricey, but lasts a long time.
doesn't irritate my acne
i find sometimes it makes my skin sting a litte
i wanted to try something fancier than the drugstore cleansers i've been using forever
it's not too foamy
it leaves my combination skin feeling even
i never see any dirt or makeup when using those
there's no other cleanser i'd ever use
great stuff and removes my mascara too!
it leaves my skin a little bit greasy when i apply it "enough"
f you have oily skin you'll have to pair this with some other product to control oil
i can barely even see my pores so this moisturizer definitely minimized my pores
), it does not make my skin feel oily.
you only need a tiny bit so that's the pro!!!
it is so lightweight it almost feels like i'm not wearing any moisturizer
a little tacky to allow your makeup to go on smooth
i don't use a primer because i haven't found one i like that doesn't have silicone
it leaves your skin a little tacky
so when you add a primer
it's helping to clear breakouts
i gave it 4 stars because i cannot use it as a night moisturizer as it isn't hydrating enough
i give it a 4/5 star because even though it says all skin types i'm oily
obv if you're oily they have a specific product for that skin type
love how with hydrates yet doesn't make me oily.
super light you barley know it's there.
does not leave any greasy residue on the skin
it works wonders because it hydrates my skin without having me looking like a greaseball
didn't want to block my pores
which is what freaks me out the most
as i don't think it's rich enough for that
it's so light weight i can use it during the day
it's nearly impossible to keep your skin hydrated in the winter
this won't always suffice with the moisture i need overnight
dry skin so perhaps it's just me
it doesn't cause any breakouts
it is a little greasy for daytime use under makeup
doesn't have any spf
it's a wee bit sticky for morning use before foundation for me
it's not oily at all and doesn't cause acne.
i love that this did not clog my pores
they irritate my skin
cause me to break out or leave me feeling like a greaseball
this moisturizer when you put it onto your face in an instant you will feel that cool feeling
does not leave a greasy feeling
it just is so light it's almost whipped
it's a nice thick consistency without being too heavy or oily on my skin
doesn't leave me with a greasy film after application nor melts off my face
my face just feels so fresh when it's on.
it's the only cream that doesn't make my skin oily or cause breakouts
does wonders for texture issues.
this sheer cream doesn't disappoint
i personally find that it's enough moisture for my combination skin
i don't feel extra oily afterward
doesn't get tacky or break me out
it's really light & goes on easily.
my skin does not seem to be so uneven
this is an oil free product that doesn't dry out my skin like a lot of products
it doesn't make my already greasy skin anymore greasy
i don't think dry skin owners can use this on its own as a daily moisturizer since it is a bit too light-weight
adds just the right amount of moisture under my bb cream
i sometimes only use this
i still can't get all the product out like i can with an eye dropper
not sticky going on
it is sticky which i know some people might not like
only time i had a problem with it under makeup was when i used the sheer transformation moisturizer which made my skin look flaky
my skin looks even
have used all sorts of serums before this that doesn't even compare
i sometimes mix this with the youth face oil
i wonder if it just aggravates certain skin types
not anything that lingers on your face
you can almost feel it sinking into your pores
it doesn't burn the skin
a sure cure for dull skin.
love the smell too.
i can easily go makeup-free
i can't say whether it improved the evenness of my complexion or firmed my skin because i only used it a couple of times
my skin started looking cruddy again
i usually hate the smell of oranges
the pump bottle means product isn't touched or wasted as it's applied
my blush doesn't soak into dry skin anymore
your lips will never be chapped ever again!
i can't imagine living without the truth serum!
i've used other pricier serums that didn't do as good
it's not a magic bullet
could be off-putting if you hate fragrances
because of my oily skin i can get scared a product like this could give me more shine than glow
it is a little sticky at first when you apply it
it's light on the face which i love.
even when i moisturize my face usually feels tight bc it's kind of dry which causes me to produce more oil
it's my go to product for every skin concern
my skin eats this stuff up
doesn't leave a sticky after-feel!
i don't mind because it is refreshing
i don't use anything special on my skin besides a good moisturizer
it might seem pricey
however i find that it does make my skin matte
it's not overpowering by any means
sometimes it left a greasier finish under my makeup
it doesn't completely cure the oily skin
my face isn't shiny into the late afternoon anymore
my skin type is not super oily
so for someone who is super oily
i like that it is not too mattifying on me because it doesn't make my skin feel stripped
is one of few moisturizers that doesn't cause me to break out
does not make my face feel oily or greasy
this doesn't cause any irritation or breakouts
it doesn't aggravate my skin
without risking looking like an oil slick or just use a thin layer if needed
doesn't feel mattifying immediately
usually don't have to use a primer before applying my make up
nothing i try can contain my oil
doesn't cause flair ups for me.
i am 44 still get pimples
that will make my face feeling greasy.
i really do recommend ole henriksen to everyone that has combination to severe oily skin
always on the hunt for better one for my super oily skin that still manages to have chunks of skin pealing off
doesn't dry me out or make my skin any more oily
doesn't leave my face feeling greasy
about anything can trigger blemishes
it's like giving your oily skin a drink of water without any consequences
the only negative thing i can say about it is that it has a kind of masculine smell-- maybe it's the witch hazel or one of the other ingredients
perfect to wear alone or under makeup
if the lotion is even the slightest bit too heavy
if the lotion is too irritating
it is not greasy nor does it leave my face feeling tight like so many mattifying lotions do
this one smells like it's cleaning my skin while i put it on
it's also thicker than the sheer transformation cream i used to use
no matter what i'll get oily haha
or your face will be greasy.
as someone who has the occasional awful zit or pimple it is so nice that this skin care regimine works for me
doesn't feel heavy after i apply it
or my acne isn't as bad as before
so the jar is lasting forever
i don't think the moisturizer is bothering my skin
this product does not aggravate my acne
it moisturizes so that my skin doesn't flake when i put on foundation
it doesn't make my skin produce less oil
like making my skin feel like it's covered with film
it's still my skin
this seems to do the trick without making me feel oily or break out
it doesn't make my skin break out oddly
if you pop it in the fridge it'll make the texture much better
it gives me the perfect amount of moisture for my combo skin without making my oily t-zone too oily
doesn't make my skin greasy keeps my face matte all day
my makeup doesn't melt off
you barely feel anything on your skin.
it's says "matifying" on the container
it does not leave any kind of oily residue or shine on my face
it could seem strong if you do not like scented products
t is often hard to find a good moisturizer
it doesn't just sit on the skin
it definitely doesn't make it oilier
love the smell too!
doesn't feel heavy at all.
not greasy at all
i like how it is meant for acne prone skin
chestnut helps your skin so much
the products do not make your skin feel dry either
this hydrates, but doesn't make my skin greasy.
the only reason i gave it 4 stars is because it doesn't do much for your complexion apart from the radiance-
didn't clog my pores
this product does not contain any dimethicone -- thank you
i do still get the occassional zits
this does not make my face oily.
i don't even try other face lotions.
if you use too much it will make your face oily.
these days it's getting hot
doesn't have any scent
and the fact that it's anti aging is even better.
let's face it ladies after sixty taking care of your skin only gets more important
this doesn't seem to be an anti-aging cream
the cream smells a bit weird if you are not used to it
didn't make my skin greasy
you need the tiniest bit
it is a great balm for when you've got a pimple that's healing
doesn't leave that greasy layer that la mer did
proper application consists of warming about a pea size amount on the tips of the fingers until it's actually clear
you will look super
realize that it doesn't take much it makes my skin feel soft
it didn't aggravate my pores at all
if you don't rub it in enough
i swear it makes my face firmer
yet does not make me look shiny/oily
yes it is thick
i recommend it just at bedtime so who cares if it is "balmy"
does not cause acne
i know there is an eye cream formula
i love that it's not sticky or has any tightening properties to it
it might feel like you have gobs on your skin
your skin will love you in the morning
i actually don't mind that it gives a dewey look to the skin
you only need the slightest bit
this cream does everything it claims
needless to say the winter can be brutal for me
or my skin has taken a moisture hit it's my go to
wouldn't recommend it for the day because it is heavy
does go on greasy
no matter how lightly i apply it
it doesn't leave your skin oily at all
my skin doesn't dry anymore all day
this doesn't make me oily at all
it's purely thick cream that is perfect for harsh
not only on your face but your lips too.
when you rub it between your fingers before you apply it
it also doesn't irritate or cause my sensitive skin to break out
the smell is one of the things i like about this moisturizer
it doesn't burn even after using a scrub.
this cream is a nice texture without being too heavy
i usually use regular cream for my eye area too
there are weird crystals around the screw top
i can't make it mix back in
didn't find the smell at all repulsive
they won't smell like flowers bc they are concentrating ingredients to help your skin not your nose
this is the only product that can moisturizer my skin without giving me a bad breakout
only cream i can use with my skin type.
not sticky at all
the smell is completely tolerable
if you are break out prone
this cream has never made my skin burn
it's too bad that others can't seem to get over the smell
usually scents don't bother me
i guess people's sniffers are different.
so far it hasn't clogged my pores which i struggle to find moisturizers that don't
it's really easy to spread
it's nothing overly noticeable i actually enjoy the smell because it's so familiar
doesn't leave a greasy feeling
i make it all day long without getting super shiny
you'll notice a difference when you this.
buy it, it's a staple.
the texture is not bad either
almost has a liquid feel as you massage it into your face
does not leave an oily feel afterwards
this cream does just that.
yes it's a thin consistency
doesn't give you a heavily moisturizer feeling
not too greasy or heavy
doesn't make me more oily
definitely don't rub your eyelids with it or get close to the eye area because it stings even if it doesn't make direct contact
i don't usually have acne
it's not great for relieving redness
as it's so smoothing
i don't even feel the need to wear makeup
feel it's made a difference in skin clarity
*note* if you break out using this product it means your skin is getting irritated because your skin is too "young"
although it makes no mention of acne control
this night cream does it all!
i don't have any problems with acne
that i don't need to use as much moisturizer at night
just make sure to apply a moisturizer beforeh
i get those painful big pimples pretty often
now i just dollop help me on my problem spots
wether it's high end or drugstore
it's genetic, so there's very little i can do.
it's not heavy or oily.
it's even healing up my acne!
help me specifically helps in making sure my face doesn't become super oily again
i will be trying something else for these pesky wrinkles on my forehead
i will probably purchase it again when i run out because it's a great moisturizer that doesn't make my skin oily
yes i a few wrinkles it sounds weird
my sling use to be combo/oily now it's practically normal i get a little shinny
that's only if the room is hot or if i'm sweating
pimples don't last long with this
there is no perfume added or even makes my face itch like other products tend to do
purchase for acne purposes so can't say much about wrinkles
my skin doesn't feel so oily everyday.
this product dries out your skin a little if you consistently use it
i get occasional breakouts
my skin has a glow most days that it's never had before
i wanted something that will exfoliate my skin over time to help keep any kind of aging at bay
go through a single tube of anything whether it's a moisturizer
never irritates my skin
i know you can't get a face lift in a bottle
this stuff is not a face lift in a bottle
my skin is dryer but i can deal with that.
it's the only retinol product that doesn't irritate my skin
it's great at fading my acne scars
it is gentle yet does everything it's supposed to: reduce fine lines
i think it will keep the product from exposure to air which would ruin it
doesn't irritate like most retinols do
it's going to be a regular part of my routine
this face cream is so gentle you hardly know it works until you see the face cloth
i am very happy that it's keeping my face clear of occasional pimples that have plagued me since i was in my late teens
i probably shouldn't have used the retinol every night
i think it's done a lot to reduce the sun damage in my undereye area
you kind of have to pile it on--a little pea-sized amount for the whole face doesn't really do it
there's plenty left in the tube still
it doesn't work quite as well on wrinkles
i don't have to wear a lot of foundation anymore to hide the pores
the only reason way it's getting 4 starts is the packaging
so little that it has absorbed as i put on sunblock
it's a nice eye gel to apply in the mornings because there's a nice cool sensation
i didn't see any lines forming where my makeup usually cakes
t doesn't get cakey
not dark circles though
you know it works when you have dark circles under your eyes
it's usually worse at the end of spring when the pollen count is bad
only problem is it is a little greasy/shiny when you first apply it
i love the color because you cannot see it on your face
my skin takes a turn for the worst especially my eye area because i tend to scratch my eyes a lot which causes bags
they can really agitate/sting if they seep into your eye
this stuff doesn't irritate at all
this eye cream does wonders!
i don't know if it does much for puffiness or dark circles
i keep this stuff in the fridge
i never use concealer so i was pointed to this.
this isn't really for anti-aging or wrinkles
it's just a little pricey
creams work better when you apply them cold
i don't feel it's a great moisturizer
usually sting or hurt
i do believe it contains some mica or something of the sort
although i think it's better to use it at night cause it can reduce puffy eyes
doesn't irritate my skin or eyes
don't find it does anything for wrinkles
but it is not anti-wrinkle.
i love that it goes under or over makeup!
it is cooling, and doesn't make my mascara run!
stop ripping dumb masks off of your face
this is the only thing that doesn't dry my skin out
if you are used to an apricot scrub type of deal that's more abrasive this may feel "ineffective" to you- that's how i felt
my dermatologist informed me i've been sloughing off too many layers of skin -_- it seemed super pricey for the amount of product you get
don't know how it is with a spatula
which i do like because it at least keeps the pimple from not growing bigger if it's super stubborn
these little bumps/clogged pores i couldnt get rid of
another plus is this stuff lasts forever just add a bit of water if it dries out
i usually get small bumps on my face before they turn into a real pimple
even though i know i shouldn't for those clean pores
i love that you can use it as a mask or just for blemishes
really reduces all the red that's all over my face
it's not too heavy on my skin
so it's a three in one product.
my usually oily skin was more matte than it normally is when i wake up
now it's literally gone
i don't have crazy bad acne
this mask really shrinks the size of the pimples
sometimes i even sleep with this mask on
you'll love it too
i know it's pricey
this stuff is pure gold
it's wonderful on any oily parts of the skin or for spot treatment or to help make pores smaller
makes your skin look
it's super easy to put on
sucks out all my pesky big pores that i haven't managed to get rid of
i don't wear makeup everyday
is definitely worth your buck if you battle oiliness
not only clears my pimples fast
your face will feel like a baby's bum
annoying deep pimples that usually stay for weeks on my face are gone in two days with this stuff
this stuff is my holy grail to clear skin
it isn't at all messy
it doesn't irritate my skin at all
this is my go-to mask when i'm in a lazy mood.
this mask doesn't irritate me
other clay masks i've used tend to be a bit messy
it's great for my oily skin.
it's gentle enough to be used often.
this mask definetly did not dry my face out like other charcoal masks
although i did not see improvements on my blemishes i did notice it cleaned out my pores
highly recommend if you get huge pesky zits.
i don't use masks like this often
even when it comes to masks
it's super easy to spread all over the face
it's nothing too over powering
the consistency is just like any type of lotion
i didn't have any redness
sometimes sephora sends you gifts
i love that you can choose to use this every day or as a deep cleanser
i feel it helps even out my oily t zone
didn't leave a tight feeling
not really a clogged pore- i dap a little bit of this mask on it
it does leaves your face a bit tight
it's not harsh on the skin
it comes with a little spatula so you don't have to dip your fingers in the pot
it helps my acne to come to the surface rather than sit underneath
good for the occasional breakout as a spot treatment too
i love this cuz it cleans your skin without giving it too much harm
anything meant for sensitive skin did nothing to help my acne
the texture is even
it's great for oily skin
even though it doesnt completely get rid of pimples
this mask is just that!
i notice i'm not as oily as usual
great product for those who have acne prone skin because it helps clear up breakouts
even as daily cleanser if you want
the tradeoff is that it does nothing for tone or texture
caudalie's creams literally the only ones that my skin accepts
can get oily at times in my t-zone
doesn't get completely absorbed into the skin
may not be good for those with oily skin types.
this does not aggravate my skin
a lack of moisture in your skin causes breakout issues as well so don't be afraid to moisturize if u do break out
it's difficult to find anything that hydrates right
it doesn't have an spf
not bad, but i like scent.
does not leave me too shiny or too matte
miraculously it doesn't cause breakouts
here's the true test of time: will it keep my skin balanced during times when my skin goes through it's once a month hormonal activity
i normally breakout with one irritating zit once a month
it's not the typical take some out of a jar/pump
it is not greasy.
fancy ingredients they can
i really like the simple packaging
and it doesn't irritate my skin.
feels nice without being feely.
can't use anything too oily or thick without risking breakouts
this is my go-to moisturizer when i don't need something with spf
does not make my skin look oily
def not oily which was something i was trying to avoid
i am not at all "oily" looking by night time
i can't rave enough about how lovely it made my skin look
yet not greasy or heavy
i can't attest to any anti-aging properties though since i am using the retin-a first
i don't really like to stick my fingers in my creams
does not clog pores or cause my skin to breakout
i can't say that it will erase wrinkles
if you want something natural to stave off dryness
it seems to make my skin even more oily
it doesn't make my skin break out or feel oily.
i like that this cream is not too thick or heavy
no matter your skin type
it wasn't too oily after applied
doesn't make your skin feel greasy
does not make my face oily
it is really hard to come acroos a moisturizer that doesn't break my skin out
doesn't make my combo skin oily
it's in the pricey side
this is the only moisturizer that doesn't irritate my skin
try it you'll love it -
caudalie doesn't waste your time with fillers.
didn't clog my oily t-zone at all
light, never leaves my face greasy.
it doesn't feel like there is anything on your skin after it's applied
it isn't heavy or sticky at all
it does not irritate the skin
try the eye cream too!
it doesn't clog my pores or cause breakouts
it the only moisturizer that doesn't break out my skin
i kinda freaked out because it was "cleansing milk"
i find it doesn't strip my skin or cause redness
i tend to go in with a cotton pad
i would recommend this cleanser if other cleansers are too harsh or drying for your skin as this does a nice job of being gentle
i can't use this on any area that is prone to breaking out
it does not lather
for my spots with more acne i sometimes use another cleanser to make sure the skin is getting a deeper clean
wouldn't attempt to use this to remove much makeup
it doesn't strip my skin
the pump dispenser will not pop up for me to use it
this probably isn't the cleanser for you
it doesn't feel like soap
is it's just the mascara
this product is gentle enough not to irritate my skin
doesn't strip fair/sensitive skin of moisture- instead it seems to leave it feeling softer
i it's non greasy, super light and sheer.
it is better than oil cleansers i have tried because it actually cleans your face
it doesn't give you that foamy
definitely clean enough if you aren't concerned about makeup residue
it doesn't really foam up
it's one of the few caudalie products that doesn't have an intense fragrance
if you expect your natural cleanser product to suds up like soap this is not for you
i do still have to use makeup remover on my eyes
a lot of comments are saying this doesn't cleanse well
it is not meant to be a makeup remover.
if you are using this just to cleanse your face
it does not foam or bubble
here is the scoop- you don't use water with this product
there is no need to scrub away anything else with a foaming cleanser
you do need to wash your face with something
i usually will use this on a cotton pad
i really love the way this cleanser dissolves my makeup on my face
works on eye makeup too
doesn't leave oily eyes for next morning's makeup application
you're just taking bottles of this you'll hate off the market for the rest of us that love it
all beauty fanatics should know that any type of cleansing milk
just because it says "no need to rinse" doesn't mean you don't need to proceed with the proper cleansing after wards
if you were not wearing any makeup then a cleansing milk is all you would need to use
if you do we're makeup then learn to properly cleanse to be a happy consumer:
my face didn't feel clean
one or two splashes of water is all you need
i can even use it to remove eye makeup.
i can use it to remove even my waterproof eye makeup with out worrying about it causing eye irritation
eyeliner easily without leaving anything greasy behind or missing bits
still not irritating my eyes
this doesn't make my skin feel tight or itchy.
the film doesn't make a difference when applying make up over it
i m not sure, it is good as cleaner but remover .
it's different because it doesn't leave your skin feeling really clean like i'm used to
i don't have to moisturizer as much
gentle enough not to irritate skin
the scent doesn't bother me.
it does not make my skin oily
you have to wipe it off with a cotton pad because it doesn't just wash off
it does leave a film on your skin
doesn't remove lipstick and mascara much.
this is a facial cleanser you'd use after you remove your make up with something else more reliable
i don't typically use this at night.
it does not leave your skin feeling tight or "squeeky" at the end
doesn't seem nearly as reactive as it used to
it's a very good eye makeup remover
it cleans my skin and doesn't make me break out.
you don't even need to use water
i agree though that it does not remove waterproof make-up on it's own
absolutely convinced i couldn't clean my skin well unless it felt squeaky
what i like about this one is that it doesn't dry my skin
after 2 weeks of cleansing my face with this i can't believe the difference
i don't need a lot of frills
don't expect it to have the same feel as when you are using a foaming cleanser
i like this make up remover a lot.
my face doesn't feelthe slightest bit stressed
this is the only cleanser that will remove my beloved benefit they're real mascara
there i'll get a zit or two
it does not combat all of my blemishes
i like how it lathers
doesn't make my face feel tight as other cleansers
seriously if you want a cleanser that takes your mascara off girl
go get yourself a makeup remover
forgot this cleanser so o had to use another
i can say this cleanser doesn't work great on clearing existing acne
i don't suffer from acne
it's pricey to me, but each bottle lasts months.
doesn't make my t-zone dry
every night it's important for me to remove all the yuck
there is still makeup you remove?
it smells so bad
if you don't care about smells
if you want the pores to be cleansed then u could also try the black bottle boscia
my face doesn't get very oily anymore
it hasn't completely gotten rid of my acne
it's also amazing at removing eye makeup.
it simply cleans all the gunk off my face
it doesn't sting as much as other makeup removers
the scent is light so it's not irritating.
i can actually leave my house with no more then some concealer
it's been years since i could pull that off without feeling self conscious
it doesn't strip the oils
doesn't feel dry and do clean deeply.
i don't get acne anymore and my face stays clear.
doesn't irritate my sling
it doesn't remove all my makeup
i won't say it keeps my face 100% clear as i am prone to stress related acne
my skin doesn't feel like it's about to bust at the seams
i would recommend it because it leaves your skin clean
it even takes off some makeup.
if you want a makeup remover that will completely remove waterproof mascara then try boscia's makeup breakup cool cleansing oil instead
it's helped me bring my oily combination skin in balance
not feeling oily for once in long time
does a good job of leaving your face squeaky clean without drying it out
i don't even use eye make up remover anymore!
doesn't irritate my skin at all
usually when i run out of a product whether it's toner
$28 is ok for a cleanser that tackles all of my needs
doesn't break me out or give me allergies
it doesn't burn or irritate my skin
you might find the smell off-putting?
for me smell in a cleanser is a deal breaker
this gel cleanser gets everything else
finally found a perfect daily cleanser that is not too drying or irritating for my sensitive
i usually use it at night after makeup remover
natural smell that you don't need to use a ton of
not too much to feel like you're washing your face forever
it's perfect if you just want a basic cleanser.
the best part is it doesn't dry out my skin at all or makes it feel tight either
and even my waterproof makeup comes off easily!!
does not overdry my acne prone skin!
it's good for your skin
don't expect it to remove your makeup
doesn't irritate my skin or cause more breakouts
doesn't have ingredients that may clear up blackheads or have anti-aging effects
it is a great all around cleanser/makeup remover that doesn't aggravate skin
this wash does not irritate my skin what's so ever
does not sting eyes
i don't have terrible acne
really really bad hormonal acne at that
even ones from fancy makeup counters
gentle enough that my eczema doesn't flare up
it's kinda like a clarifier for your face.
my face did feel squeaky clean
i always follow up with argan oil though.
i don't typically have blemishes except for time of the month
i don't know how it would work for someone who has acne or acne prone skin or with different skin type
moisturizers a year so my face doesn't get used to it
it takes off all your makeup
it isn't even bad enough to leave my face red
this makes my sin feel squeaky clean.
doesn't burn/tingle or scrub like some cleansers do
if you lather it in your h
this cleanser with my ole henriksen sheer transformation moisturizer brings them down a little by morning
i feel like it's not quiteee strong enough on my blemishes sometimes
or it simply doesn't remove makeup well
doesn't heat up on the skin
its ingredients are not harsh on your skin
i recommend this product if you have a few pimples
it is not harsh like the kate somerville in the spot treatment
i don't have heavy acne but some around.
i actually do like the applicator
i'd say if your acne isn't severe
i like how it doesn't dry out your skin
before any pimple would actually appear
this stuff gets rid of pimples almost overnight
i tend to get one or two blemishes on my face at a time
it does help to get rid of my "acne"
it has completely avoided me 4 embarrassing pimples
can be applied as often as you feel necessary to completely kill pimples
it doesn't burn like many other spot treatments
doesn't dry out your skin like crazy either
whether it's from the willow bark itself or the other soothing ingredients i'm not sure
it doesn't reduce redness even
it doesn't damage my skin
they're usually gone in the morning
it gets everywhere + sticks to everything
hopefully i don't have this problem because it's gotten to the point where i use 2 wash cloths to h
i like that this product doesn't kill my skin
i've even let my 10 year old use it for the odd pimple she's starting to get
sometimes i'll wash my face with a little baking soda before applying just to get it really clean
flaky like a lot of spot treatments do
it's the only product i've used that doesn't make the spot inflame
does not make my skin peel while it's treating my blemishes
i think for me it makes pimples less painful
whenever i have a pimple that's deep under the skin i use it
it's one of the few things that works to eliminate it
i don't get blemishes that often
this stuff really provides relief without drying or irritating
apply this product under moisturizer otherwise you might see it peeling a bit during foundation application
this stuff works wonders on my mild adult acne
there's no harsh smell, either.
unfortunately one surfaces now
i can't use any of the other spot treatments because they sting
does not drip that eye accident was me being careless
more importantly it doesn't dry out my skin or make it look irritated
it's pretty effective when it comes to making your pimples go away
willow bark from boscia is not only the only product that works for her
i find that if i see one of those pesky cysts beginning to form under my skin
it is a gel like texture so only 4/5 stars because it does tend to pill under make-up
it's so gentle that i have no worries of overuse as with other harsh acid treatments
they kind of eat my skin
a big plus that it has an applicator so you don't have to touch the skin you're treating
doesn't irritate or dry out my skin like other
it doesn't get rid of blemishes as quickly as others
doesn't leave any kind of spot treatment residue or film
it didn't brighten my under eyes though
what i like about it the most is that i can apply concealer over it without it being patchy
that's why it's part of my morning routine
doesn't have any anti aging properties in it
other plus is that it does not sting or burn!!
love what it does for instant softness
the cream is a little too thick to apply under my makeup that i only use it nightly
that doesn't come in a jar
it's somehow light enough to absorb quickly
not feel sticky or melt into the eyes
oily skin customers would probably not be too fond this
can't tell by the weight of the bottle how much is left
sometimes eye creams cause me to get little clear bumps all around my eyes
although i am in my mid-20s i still think it's important to prevent the dry lines around my eyes
most importantly it is not packaged in a jar where you have to dip your fingers
while it does not completely get rid of my circles
not from lack of sleep
i like the dispenser though you have to learn to have a light touch with it
i've tried many other eye creams that feel like they leave a tacky or heavy residue
doesn't leave any residue
it is a good cream because it doesn't sting eyes
i can't comment much on the anti aging anti puffy properties though it seems kinda mediocre in that regard
doesn't irritate my sensitive eyes or have a nasty residue or ball up like most eye creams
lack of sleep is having a bad effect on me
though i never can find a product that truly helps with my eyes cosmetically
it doesn't break the bank like other eye creams
especially since it's paraben free
remember: do not rub your eye cream!
i don't need anything by the next day because my under eye area is so supple
i fear that it's because mine are those hereditary dark circles that will never go away
i like how you can use it on both your eyelids
the consistency is perfect- not too thick or too light
it doesn't cause milia on my skin.
i guess it's on the cheaper side compared to other under eye creams
it mixes well with concealer so that's not a huge issue
i don't know about it reducing wrinkles or any of that
the fact it's light cream
the boscia eye treatment doesn't
still light enough not to affect the wear of the under-eye concealer i wear over it
it's not super thick
i don't really see a reduction in dark circles
it isn't too slippery like some eye creams that make it hard to put on concealer
it's not greasy at all.
it doesn't help for my puffiness from bad allergies
it also doesn't really minimize eye bags.
does enough to make it part of my staple of skin care products
i don't think it is a heavy-lifter like some other eye creams out there
im not one to believe an eye cream solves that
the one annoying thing is that although the pump packaging is definitely more sanitary than a jar container
it's enough to cover both eyelids upper
it's not too thick
i don't have very many wrinkles around my eyes
not irritate my skin
it doesn't feel greasy going on
it is so lightweight you can't feel it under makeup
voila i too inherited the ugly circles.
i like the scent too.
it's definitely brightening and smoothing though.
i find that during the day it doesn't interfere with my makeup
it may not good for oily skin.
it doesn't clog my pores either which is a big plus
it's so moisturizing but doesn't feel too heavy.
it's not oily and doesn't get tacky.
doesn't really linger through the day
if you're in need of a heavy duty moisturizer that doesn't feel heavy
my face seems less oily when i use this product
it's not too heavy
it's much more glowy
it's not as bad as the moisturizers i have tried in the past
it's nice to apply at night
under makeup is doesn't play well for me
this doesn't seem to aggravate it
i can't even use make up wipes
anyone with oily skin knows it makes you prone to breakouts
i truly believe it's a result of me just treating my skin inside out rather than trying to cover blemishes with makeup
the texture doesn't leave you oily or greasy
flake-free all day without turning my oily areas into an absolute disaster
does not linger on my skin
this sounds so dorky
i don't even wash my face in the morning
doesn't make me overly oily as time goes by
i do notice a difference when i don't use it after my cleanser
it didn't leave me feeling greasy or oily
the scent isn't too over power either.
it doesn't leave me feeling oily
those sensitive to scents should stay away because the scent does linger for a long time
couldn't imagine going without this moisturizer
this leaves my face looking so beautiful that i can't stop using it
i do not recxomend it for oily skin
not as dull as it use to be
i think it is a pretty good moisturizer for my fry skin
my skin can get really flaky around my nose
you may look a little shiny right after applying
it is a little greasy in the summer for my skin-
i'll do anything to get rid of my acne
it's also good for evening your skin tone
i can't speak for its brightening effects
small pores which means often moisturizers either irritate my skin horribly or sit on top of it
glowy i don't know if it'll be hydrating enough for winter
it does not make my skin more oily
unlike other moisturizers with weird scents that i just can't get with
i am not super into makeup
it doesn't do the skin correcting work of some other creams
this moisturizer doesn't leave me feeling greasy while also keeping those cheeks from getting irritated
i don't feel like it's too thick or it stays on my skin or something like that
i would not normally purchase anything scented like rose
this moisturizer does not break me out
isn't greasy at all
doesn't leave you looking like a grease slick after application
i usually wake up super greasy
does brighten and does some firming too, love it!
take a deep inhale it just sends me straight to a nice calm place hehe
i don't know what brightens my skin more
this actually doesn't clog my pores
pm with other things my derm gives me
absorbs and doesn't make me break out.
he doesn't mind the smell before bed
i don't think it's as good as the laneige facial cream i used before the belif one
it doesn't go against my other routine moisturizers
i do break out from some creams - not this one.
can't use a moisturizer for dry skin cuz i breakout
at this point this moisturizer has done it's job
it's not too heavy on the skin
i don't look for other moisturizers anymore
it's doesn't irritate my skin
although it is supposed to be a one-step cleanser i still use eye makeup remover first just because that's how i prefer to do things
i usually don't rub face cleanser over my eyes when i'm washing my face because it always manages to get in my eyes
this stuff is so gentle that i never have a problem with washing in the eye area
doesn't leave your face feeling tight
this classic face wash is still my go to.
it's gentle on my easily irritated
it's not a heavy duty cleanser
it's perfect because it doesn't make my skin dry
it's really gentle on my faced
it's so gentle i also use it to clean my makeup brushes :
doesn't make my skin feel tight around my eyes
it's definitely a light cleanser
i love this stuff for removing my makeup.
even the most stubborn waterproof mascara comes right off
anyways this cleanser is the bomb i've been re-purchasing it over the years it's gentle
it's my go to makeup remover.
especially my nose where o tend to get a loot of sebum build-up
if you want a cleanser that removes all your makeup especially around the eyes without burning your eyeballs
i even use it too clean my makeup brushes!
it's for sensitive skin so there is no way you can get a bad reaction from it
even stubborn mascara comes off.
it does make your skin a little tight afterwards tho
it's easy to carry during flights
this one doesn't foam a lot
i love this product because it just melts my makeup off
if you look at the ingredients you realize it takes of makeup easily because it is a mixture of different oils
it's gentle enough that it doesn't irritate my skin
i noticed it doesn't work as well if i apply it to completely dry skin
when i don't use it my skin will freak out
doesn't sting at all
it is not good at removing mascara.
finding a cleanser that didn't dry my skin out like most other cleansers took forever
5/5 will continue to buy this cleanser it's my go to
it is so gentle on the skin yet takes everything off
for a $24 price tag you can't lose
didn't clean my face
if i'm feeling too lazy to use eye makeup remover or i notice my pores are getting blackheads
i don't wear much makeup
i even use a tiny bit when i have stubborn lipstick on that refuses to come off
it's replaced my clinique makeup removers
it gets off all my mascara
makes my skin feel really soft afterwards which is unlike a lot of other makeup removers
the stuff sinking into your skin
the only drawback is that it's basically useless against waterproof mascara
it doesn't have an unpleasant smell or feel to it
it doesn't irritate my skin
i can remove my makeup with it
this cleanser doesn't break me out
it takes all makeup
it doesn't sting my eyes at all
it is gentle enough not to irritate my eyes
everyone's skin is different
it's helped even out my skin tone it leaves me feeling fresh
it's like the holy water or something
the difference in my skin is 1000 times better it's soft my pores have gotten smaller it helps my oily t zone
turns out that the cleanser did not remove all my makeup
it gets most of my makeup off
the best part is i usually break out horribly on my menstrual cycle
doesn't make my skin feel dry
gets off all the makeup, even waterproof.
i just can't make this my everyday cleanser unfortunately
i think it's a super light smell
my t-zone seems to be less oily also
it doesn't burn my eyes.
this is good at removing makeup 100%usually smells like fruit loop cereal too
it takes off all my makeup and it's gentle.
that's okay that's what a make up remover is for
this doesn't lather at all
doesn't make my face break out
my favourite thing about this product is that you can rub it all over your face
doesn't do anything that impressive for my skin other than clean it
i tend to be a little on the lazy side when it comes to removing my makeup
that's nothing a light moisturizer can't fix
it never ceases to amaze me how my makeup melts right off
i actually don't use it as a face cleanser that often
if i do a diligent enough job the cleanser removes all the product
tend to skip some days-
it takes off all of my waterproof makeup products so well
sometimes i have just a little bit of black under my eye from mascara
this is the only cleanser that doesn't burn when i have broken skin
it's a good face wash.
redness that didn't work as well
i am so happy i don't have to use harsh chemicals to clean my skin
it's not drying at all
not sure if it reduces my redness
it doesn't add to it which is big with my pale skin
which makes it difficult to find cleansers that do not irritate my skin
i does just what it says: soothes.
actually made my acne appear worse because of all the flaky dead skin that was building up
for some reason this is the only cleanser that works for me not only to tone down the redness i have on my cheeks
if your skin is inflammed as mine can often be
you don't get that same sensation
most days i don't wear any
it realy does work for the redness
it's not drying like other products
doesn't leave my skin feeling tight
everything irritates my face
i never look ruddy anymore
it's not rough or harsh on your skin
my skin is not only clean after i use it
i don't need to use liquid makeup anymore.
i can always count on this one to be soothing to my skin
no more weird oily spots
you can't even feel the beads
it's neither greasy nor drying, since it's a gel.
my skin isn't as irritated as it was.
stupidly believing it wouldn't matter if i used this scrub or that toner
at least i wasn't using the same soap that my kids wash their h
my skin doesn't burn or get red
i don't have to pile on makeup every morning to cover my redness so much
sometimes i feel like it's a bit too drying
it does not sting or make my face dried out like a lot of stuff i have used before
ordinary cleansers have a tendancy to leave my face a little red
doesn't smell like a medicine cabinet
plus you don't have to clean because it's made for both
like it's just lifting all the oil
make up with put all the flakiness of other serums i have used in the past
had a sticky/tacky feel after applying
it didn't 100% clear scarring or made my face completely one tone
it leaves the most amazing glow to your face without having a tacky residue on your face like other vitamin c products i have tried
this is perfect for morning as it dosent interfere with makeup application or how your makeup looks
now it's almost hard to find little acnes on his face
it doesn't make it worse or clog my pores
you definitely need to use this before your moisturizer though because it leaves skin feeling a little bit sticky
don't need much moisture
not either matte or greasy
i has hardly any scent.
it's neither sticky nor greasy
this is a guy who hates facial products
even though it's designed for men
it doesn't clog my pores
he's tried a few men's products
as this product doesn't contain any
its not greasy, doesnt leave a film on your face.
not even the clari-sonic
they did nothing to the size of my pores
it doesn't take long for the texture of your skin to change for the better
the only bad thing is the smell lol smells like vinegar almost
i didn't get any new pimples from the makeup
it makes my skin look airbrushed when my makeup is on
its crazy how it seems to work almost instantly with the pores on
it doesn't make the pores go away
i still use a pore filler when i put on my makeup
i do still have to blot like
my pores where horrible after a bad acne after my 30's
but i would try any thing to minimize my pores.
i don' know if it is the dermadoctor's wrinkle revenge or this product that is doing the trick for my skin
large pores that even the most expensive facials can't budge
especially when i'm not wearing makeup
with this plus a little powder they're basically invisible
buyer beware : it smells awful.
it doesn't burn when you put it on like some other products with alcohol in it
it hasn't inspired breakouts or anything
cuz if i use it more i get oily
my skin has completely cleared up -- don't know how they're related
i can see a difference in my pores
this stuff makes them disappear without irritating my face or making it red
this is a great starter serum if you've never used one before
but, suddenly i can't get the pump to work.
they're less dark than yesterday for sure
be warned though, it's potent.
it'll almost feel like you are putting on alcohol or a toner
some pores on my nose have even had actual " plugs" of the stuff that was clogging the pore come out
it doesn't sting or burn
it isn't sticky or flakey
i don't feel that this dries me out
although your pores don't completely shrink up
it does go on a bit sticky
the amount of time it lasts on my skin depends upon how oily/sweaty i am
my super congested skin has been purging so much ickiness
washing the face with different products doesn't help much
granted i examine them with microscopic intensity maybe even obsess about them a bit
but otherwise - it rocks!
i asked the sephora employee for a product that would suck all the gross stuff out of my pores
my skin never gets greasy during the day
even concealer was not enough to hide them
i can't comment on its effect on rosacea since i don't have it
much more sanitary than something you'd put your fingers in
you can't tell when it's empty
i've used this in combination with the ain't misbehavin cleanser
i started using it after thinking i was oily for so long
my skin tone is even
so you are not wasting any of the lotion
it's just a frustrating intermittent rosacia type redness
i got this to see if it could help my rosacea issues like pink overtones
a skin issue around my nose that is so easily irritated
the down side is i had to buy blush because i haven't worn it in about 10 years
doesn't doesn't feel heavy when it goes on
doesn't feel greasy when it dries
makes my skin have an even tone
this is the only lotion that does not irritate my skin
can't even remember all the things i've tried for redness
it's taken me five years to find the right moisturizer with my oh-so-very sensative skin
still didn't get all the redness out
this product really does tone down redness
doesn't feel greasy at all
when it's hot it's bad.
this does what it claims to do -- it calms redness
not at all greasy
i only use this at night because it's a little too rich for my combination skin in the day
pots of other moisturizers that never quite did the job
i don't have all the irritation
could be because of my bangs.
rosacea problem cheeks, they're bad.
my skin is so bad a lot of people notice when it's bad
there's no hint of the irritation
it's hard to keep track of when you're running out
it's not too heavy
doesn't cause any breakouts
lol it also fights anti-aging so that is great because with rosacea you can't really do too much other than stay out of the sun
can't say whether it helps redness
i think it was clogging my pores a bit
it doesn't make me more oily
i don't have a skin condition
yes the cream can tingle
it doesn't seem to irritate my already angry skin
the prickly stinging i usually feel is almost gone
it's well wortth the 85.00 price tag!
it's thick but not heavy or greasy.
you can use as day & night cream.
that's just how rosacea works.
watch yourself being airbrushed on the spot
the new package is even better cause you dont contaminate the cream with your fingers
i think this actually does help my omnipresent
doesn't get bitty when applying make-up over it
it looks like i have dark circles
don't have to use so much concealer
it tingles/burnes a little when you apply it
it doesn't irritate my eyes
is neither too greasy / light not too thick
it's the only product that works for me in helping my sagging eyelids
i don't feel like it helps with fine lines/wrinkles at all
maybe it's all in my head
not worry about running eyeliner
that is because it's clay
it's great at zapping pimples
it's very messy if you take it in the shower with you
fussy skin that doesn't take well to most skin care items
when applying the mask it's pretty sheer
i truly love this mask because it's so gentle on the skin
this is my go to mask when i want to clean out my pores
it really clears out my large pores that always have gunk in them from just basic makeup
it's gentle enough for every day use
it's clay after all!
it just sort of glides a bit
i can't give it 5 stars b/c when you wash it off it literally goes everywhere making your sink a mess
must have if you have breakouts or acne problem.
you don't have to worry about it washing down the drain if you keep it dry
it seems to suck all the gross stuff out of my pores
i tried it on my dog who is scratching her skin to a mean state of irritation
she lets me rub her down with a paste i make from this
it dries really fast into a cement like block-- so there's no mess at all
i know this sounds gimmicky
nothing else would do it prior to this bar of clay altho it is slightly overy drying to some parts of my face
i just dont put it on the areas it dries out
this bar doesn't irritate me
i didn't want to add this extra step in my cleansing routine
whenever you want to use the mask
everything that treats the acne dries out my skina nd it becomes flaky
no need for harsh acne cleansers anymore.
they were so annoying
i couldn't get rid of
none got completely rid of my blackheads
i am hardly getting any new acne.
just be aware that your acne will get worse at first as it pulls the impurities to the surface
i don't have itchy or
but it's because it works and it lasts forever!
t-zone or basically only where i'm experiencing clogged pores
i tend to use this as a mask
that's an easy fix- buy a cheap foundation brush to apply
large zits that wouldn't clear up
it keeps breakouts away like nothing else!!!
don't expect this to act like soap.
(so it doesn't "melt!
i love what this does for your body in the shower
while i cannot attest to it's acne treatment abilities
all you need to do is let it dry on a soap dish
four stars cause i can't make it thicken up more on my face since its not in a tube
it also doesn't make my skin shiny/over-produce oil like some products do to me
so don't scrub with it
or you'll irritate your skin
just make sure you don't smoke a cigarette
it's more of a luxury for me
i like that it's made of fuller's earth without additives
it easily beats the glamglo everyone is obsessed with too
the stubborn ones may need another round
there is also a tube version that you can mix with your facial cleanser which a lot of ppl seem to get good results from
:) (btw it does exfoliate , so keep that in mind.
there's quite a bit left
it isn't messy if you follow the directions
i feel like i had tried everything to get my hormonal breakouts at bay
if your on the fence/skeptical about a simple bar of clay working wonders on your skin
that is not a problem that a little bit of moisturizer couldn't fix
i like it because it doesn't burn my skin or that strong "cooling" minty effect
just be careful not to rub directly on your skin
i realize it's basic in that it's ingredient is fuller's earth
doesn't leave the skin too dried out afterward like some masks can
usually when i take my makeup off
the only thing i don't like is that its very messy to apply
i remove with a warm wash cloth until the cloth doesn't show anymore clay
it is a bit mess to use
this bar is too $$ for me to use in the shower
i do mean everything for my oily
i love how it doesn't have all the extra synthetic ingredients in it
it is not messy at all
you can tell by its smell
i don't know if this claims to clear acne or brighten the dark spots on your skin
sometimes i don't even use moisturizer afterwards that's how well this cleanser works
it's now a staple in my routine
when i do wear makeup
which you should do anyway so you're getting your face clean before you cleanse
it doesn't sting your eyes
it washes off mascara which a lot don't do
it's not harsh on my skin
also doesn't leave my skin dried up
it's glides right onto the skin.
i love that it's gentle enough to use on my eyes
i don't think it removes makeup as well as it claims to
i love how it can remove eye makeup
it's great not having to use harsh face wash to get eye-makeup off
i sometimes use it with my clarisonic
it clears my face unlike any other cleanser i have tried
even when i have breakouts
this is the only cleanser that doesn't make it redder when i get out of the shower
sometimes gentle cleansers won't really do anything for your skin
you can wash your face with such a small amount of this amazing smelling cleanser
all your eye makeup will melt away without too much rubbing
none will be left under your eyes like weird eyeliner
your eyes won't burn
probably 6-10 pimples on my face at a time
because it's super basic
something simple to get the makeup off your face
not leave you with 500 zits in the morning
usually you can get a small bottle for 100 pts
not to mention this face wash easily clears my skin in about 2 days
it's gentle enough that it doesn't strip my skin dry
it doesn't irritate my eyes like other makeup removers or leave a tightening residue on my face
it doesn't make my face feel tight
i don't care about scents unless they're unbearably strong
it's just a good cleanser
because when i try i always return to this for it's soothing
i never get acne
it is the only face wash i have ever used that doesn't irritate my eyes
after washing my face with this cleanser it's gone
i love using it to remove my makeup
it's the little things, people.
i dont need to scrape off the cleanser from my skin
my face doesn't feel dry i just use my oils at
my skin doesn't feel stripped at all it feels plump
that's because it is soap free
doesn't over dry and doesn't make you oily.
it doesn't foam up a lot
it take off makeup residue that most makeup removers don't
usually don't leave reviews on anything
this stuff took my fake eyelashes off better than an eye makeup remover ever could
wasn't convinced at first because i usually like really strong pore cleansers
it's the one i turn to if i've already used my purity
it's not great for makeup removal
nothing works as well to remove all makeup waterproof or not
and it doesn't leave any residue behind.
i got the fresh skin care box or whatever it's called with the mask the face wash the lotion
love how it doesn't have a weird scent
doesn't have too strong of a smell
this product is so gentle it doesn't make my face look blotchy at all
my skin is a mess without this stuff
that it doesn't work as an overall makeup remover
i think it's good for cleansing the skin after having used a makeup wipe or some other kind of makeup remover
i love this product, but my skin gets oily a lot!
it's nice to use a cleanser that does not make me immediately run for moisturizer to get rid of that tight
i don't much like the smell
with little to no " scrubbing" my mascara comes off so quickly
my skin dries out so fast if i ever use a cleanser
it doesn't sting my eyes or pull my skin.
(keep in mind it doesn't foam right away!
it doesn't strip nor overpower my skin
doesn't have any strong odors
it does not irritate your skin
actually it moisturize your face to a degree that you'll feel like you've just put on a thin layer of lotion
it smells like what it is supposed to smell like
a couple things to mention: if you don't like a cleanser that doesn't produce a lot of foam
i generally find face cleansers that don't produce a lot of foam hard to wash off from you face
it is easy to wash off
say it- this is not a great makeup remover
it's not so perfume-y that my sensitive skin would break out
it's definitely a deep cleansing mask
it does tingle a bit when first applied
i find that it does not leave your face feeling uncomfortably tight like some clay masks tend to do
you can actually see it drawing oil out of your pores as it dries
it does dreg up all the dirt
embedded acne like me this might happen to you too
it's for both men
doesn't sting on blemishes or anything
it does sting a bit when you apply it from the mint attri
it did get rid of a good portion of blackheads
you can see the oil pulling our of your pores
upon washing my face i would say maybe 20% of clogged pores were gone
it really brings all of the gunk out of my skin.
i just grit my teeth because the results it gives are so good
this is everything i want in a clay mask.
black heads just can't ever seem to go away for me
you could actually see the pores
i suggest you wash it off in the shower because it's very red
might ruin your sink
have bought so many "pore cleansing" masks because i have blackheads which are impossible to remove without getting a professional facial
let me tell you that this is seriously the best mask for removing blackheads
i would really recommend this mask to anyone struggling with blackhead removal
it's also great because it doesn't have any harsh chemicals
it's gave me a little "stingy" sensation
feels like it's getting all up in your pores to clean them out
it's not nearly as bad as i've experienced with other face masks
doesn't leave skin too tight
not as often because it's for men
it doesn't get tight like other clay masks
he somethimes doesn't like the extra shine
i like this mask, but it is so red.
didn't make my face red or irritated.
my face will start oily especially at my t-zone
i don't have to wash my face a lot
make sure you don't put this on directly after you've shaved
i find that many mask smell.
it is a kind of thinner clay mask so u need to layer a bit more
well when it is done drying just make sure you wipe completely off because otherwise your face looks flushed
i don't think it would dry out someone with not-so-oily skin
-alone product if i want a softer cleansing
i felt that i still needed to cleanse it with another product coz i felt it left my skin oily
for me it is expensive if i hve to use another cleanser afterwards
i find that pairing it with a cleansing wipe does the trick
i will say it does not lather
that squeaky clean feeling many like in their face us actually causing damage for you
it does not remove makeup well
so you definitely need to use makeup remover before washing your face
in my 20's their oily skin line was the one thing that would clear up my acne
now in my 40's the cleansing milk is the one thing that leaves my skin soft without causing breakouts
i can use it on my eyes without irritation.
i even stopped using makeup remover because it does a decent though not totally thorough job with my eye makeup
it's going to be my permanent face wash.
as this doesn't have the cleaning power to scrub it off
it actually does work to pull all kinds of gunk out of your poors
not much lather but smells nice.
i like to use this cleanser in the morning when my face doesn't need deep cleansing
i also like that it removes my makeup too!
this is the only face wash that keeps my skin acne free
if you dont wear heavy make-up
don't expect it would remove waterproof make up completely
doesn't leave my face feeling tight afterwards
really just some eyeliner
too bad sephora doesn't carry the luxury size of this product
my face doesn't even tight after i use it
i sometimes forget if i already put on moisturizer or not
it's a great cleanser, to be used daily
i think it has a tendency to clog my pores over time so now i use it only as a backup to another cleanser
i don't get the tight
it seemed odd to me to use a non-foaming cleanser on my combination skin
no, you don't get mounds of suds.
i can see how this moisturizer doesn't work for other people as it is quite thick
my skin doesn't feel greasy or heavy
is not heavy or sticky feeling
really rub/pat it into my skin
when i apply it it is easily viable that my skin is left with a matte glow which is nice for those oily girls like me
i'd say it's medium weight
doesn't make me break out or too dry
you get what you pay for with face creams.
it controls the oil but doesn't dull the skin.
as a man i don't need gloat flashy skin i was simple hydrated not flashy
it simply gets everything off your face!
can give me a headache silicon feelingoverall: not the most hydrating product i have ever used
though it lacks color, that's fine with me.
it can be worn alone by those like myself who don't wear makeup
i wouldn't want to add shiny
i gave 4 because it's not as matte as i'd expected a "matte" advertised product to be
this doesn't make me oily throughout the day
i will say that i don't really notice that glow too much after spraying my face
it's called 'matte glow' which seems contradictory
it's great under makeup as a primer because it's so light
yet this moisturizer does not effect its formula
so the jar doesn't go slowly
it doesn't feel too heavy or oily
i don't worry about shine all day
it is a bit tacky if you don't put make up over it
it's nothing that's intolerable
i do like this product cause it's matte !
i can't wait to use it daily
doesn't make my skin oily at all
i definitely recommend trying a sample if you have oily skin
this product doesn't sting!
so when i scoop up with a spatula sometimes if i'm not careful it doesn't stick to spatula
i didn't feel naked it makes your skin feel poreless
not tacky or sticky at all
it won't keep you matte all day
i love the way my makeup looks when i use this with a mattifying primer on top
it doesn't go on greasy or feel oily
helps not make it so oily
thats usually in the summertime
once is absorbed it just feels like your skin i can't explain it
if you're iffy on scents don't worry its not that overpowering
skin does not get shiny
you know those little clear plastic jars that look like caps?
well she filled it almost full unlike the other stingy employee that didn't give me enough of a glam glow mask to even try it despite it not actually taking anything from her
by the time i got home i still wasn't shiny
and i like the smell too!
it left my skin really tacky
so unless your ingesting it
i can wear this under my makeup without needing a touch up by 10 am like i usually do
i wouldn't recommend it for matte makeup foundation because you're basically wasting the product
there's only two or three moisturizers i've ever used that haven't broken my skin out
they're both clinique products
i decided to give this a go hoping it would moisturize my skin enough that it would get rid of some dry patches i have going on
i didn't love it underneath makeup seeing as it did not keep my skin matte
it the fragrance hasn't made me break out
when it goes on it melts into your skin
"glow" could coexist anyway
i can't believe how well this work with my nars pore primer
not to heavy for day wear
it's kept me matte all day with no setting powder
however it does leave my skin a little bit tacky which i don't like
i personally don't love the becca primer because it sometimes leaves my skin looking super dry
i rated it 4 stars because it doesn't have an spf
which would be great as i don't like layering a bunch of products on my skin
i don't have bad acne/pimples
this moisturizer does not make my face shiny at all
i can't say that this made my skin stay completely matte all day
doesn't have a strong scent which i prefer
it didn't completely suck the life out of my face
can't speak to how well it keels oil at bay
i rarely make reviews it's is really moisturizing yet light
does it's job it's good when you put it in the fridge
does not irritate my skin at all
it feels a little bit sticky after apply
it's helped my dark spots disappear for a more even complexion
it's mild enough that it is okay
i don't like using a lot of serums because they usually make my skin even more oily
so the skin would peel-off -- it certainly did peel off
i usually wake up with a slick face no matter what i use at night
my only complaint is that sometimes the serum feels kind of tacky or sticky on my face
my fact illuminates but not like oily or greasy.
it still wouldn't feel greasy or even look oily
this stuff is a miracle in a bottle
they do not make my skin too oily
while it didn't really help with my acne scars
don't get me wrong it's great i have some pitted scars that were filled in with continued use of this serum
i guess this will all depend on your amount of scarring
acne prone skin that doesn't usually get dried out in this way
this stuff is magic in a glass bottle
it's a must in my day and night routine.
it is not too sticky or not too thin for my skin.
i typically have been trying to brighten my skin
it did not worsen or help the oily spots of my face
those suckers are gone now
my acne scars aren't glowing in the dark anymore.
otherwise i wear benefit's oxygen wow
it's definitely part of my daily routine!
nothing seems to work other than super oily things
it's the only thing i use under makeup
the product is basically scentless too.
i can't say enough about this serum
you need 3 drops, maybe 4, max.
my skin isn't flaky as long as i regularly use the product which is good
i love them so much that i actually purchased the caudalie instant foaming cleanser
it gets a little sticky on the face
it's because of this product
can only assume that my skin looks
oily mix skin been a mom of 3 i have stress face lets just say
pat on some avocado oil let me tell you my skin has been looking so moisturize
it's one of those things where you notice how soft your skin is
sometimes in the morning
it managed to get rid of my hyper pigmentation in no time
even your skintone over night
i don't wear makeup throughout the work week
i love that it's neither oily or drying
i can't have anything with salicylic acid because for some reason it makes me break out
i see such a difference even the way my makeup goes on you can barely see the marks through the makeup i give this a 5 stars
its not greasy or heavy.
soft smooth etc etc i definitely will be buying along with the moisturizer
if i lost my entire beauty routine in a natural disaster or zombie apocalypse
here's a pic of me with no makeup on.
then does not cause any redness or irritation when used
it really gets in your pores and cleans them out.
it basically cleans/washes your face.
'm not stripping my skin everyday of it's natural oils
yet doesn't make other parts of my skin oily/break out
exfoliants are tough as they can sometimes clog pores or breakouts
wouldn't recommend using every day as it feels a tad abrasive
everytime i clean my face with this it makes my skin smoother
it's gentle enough for every day use
doesn't have a strong smell
it doesn't irritate my skin.
this is literally the only face wash that controls my adult acne
doesn't make me extra greasy or dry
be gentle when using this stuff.
it's gentle enough to use every day
you shouldn't have any issues with it drying out your face
it doesn't lather too much
even though it doesn't lather a lot
it cleans my face without irritating it
i usually don't like
if you add a little water to your h
doesn't hurt my skin
it did not make my sometimes-oily
it is not drying or irritating like other exfoliators i have used in the past
if you scrub even just gently you will still feel very clean
i would recommend not to use it everyday because it it can dry out your skin
sometimes it can make the skin around my nose
it's not too citrusy as some of the other comments may imply
gentle enough to use every day
if you want something stronger try the laura mercier face polish
i rarely use eye creams because i'm in my twenties
it is just abrasive enough
i think it keeps my skin flake free
t leaves my face feeling soft without being too much of a scrub for daily use
it does not irritate your skin
it does not exfoliate as much as i would like
if you want something stronger try the laura mercier face polish
maybe because of the beads
you shouldn't be using this to scrub off your eye makeup
shouldn't really be exfoliated much at all
the cleanser is gentle enough that my skin was not irritated at all -- in fact
it's strong enough to remove all impurities in my oily t-zone
it's not a fake or overpowering scent
it doesn't irritate my skin like other scrubs have in the past
be careful not to get the little exfoliators in your eyes or you'll have a heck of a time getting em out
but, this cleanser does not strip your skin.
needless to say i was scared to death to put something "abrasive" on my skin
your face won't itch
you won't see any redness after use
for me, it's a staple in my skin regimen.
it's a great eye gel to apply before makeup.
why would you use this one rather than the balm if you want a more hydrating product
i really didn't think i had puffy eyes or circles until i used this gel
if it doesn't i'll likely look into a cream formula from clarins
it doesn't leave a sticky after feel
doesn't get bitty under make-up
this little tube of gel helps make them less visible if you give it half an hour to work it's magic
i don't have to use as much concealer to cover up
which i think you have to do to reduce dark circles
it doesn't wander into my eyes and works quickly.
it doesn't ball up of show underneath makeup
you can't expect an eye gel to completely diminish your bags
isn't heavy or greasy
i don't really have a problem with undereye circles
i still sometimes smile in the mirror
no cream will lighten them suckers up
doesn't irritate my eyes also.
it's like a mini massage every morning.
it doesn't ever irritate around my eyes
i think it's really meant to combat dark circles rather than dryness/ wrinkles
wasn't heavy enough to become my only eye cream
don't have crinkles too badly yet
also didn't make my eyes puffy, as many do!
does not sting or burn my sensitive eyes
i don't even need concealer any more.
i can't say my wrinkles vanished
does not make my makeup smear
it's a bit on the pricier side
it's not sticky and is the perfect consistency.
it's also not so thick that it seems to weigh down your eyelids
i think it's just from the perfect hydration it's been getting
i only apply it on my under eye because it's hydrating as the description stated it's for aging skin
the big plus for this eye cream it doesn't cause millia or tiny white bumps on the under eye because most eye are really heavy cream
doesn't sting my eyes
please don't stop making it bare minerals
i don't sleep much because of work
it doesn't leave a greasy mess that would ruin your makeup
typically i will lose sleep
it has even lightened my dark circles to wear i don't have to wear as much concealer
0 ounce just doesn't last long
the price is something to wince at
dont have a lot of wrinkles to test it on
i always use under eye concealer one of my have tos even when i don't wear much make up
i just want to do it as gracefully as i can
don't have fine lines
most are fine smile lines that don't bother me at all
it does not itch or burn and goes in right away.
don't get enough sleep as the result of a very dem
i know that fine lines won't magically disappear
this is one of the first eye creams i've used that doesn't make my eyes water
i don't like using a primer in my summer routine
doesn't seem like it bc it's not heavy
used clinques all about eyes in rich which didn't do any age preventing
so my makeup goes on smooth
so my makeup goes on smooth
actually it's a little bit greasy for me
i feel putting your finger in the other creams might contaminate
i don't have wrinkles around my eyes yet
i don't have problems with dark circles
to find that in just a cream might be wishful thinking :
my eyes aren't looking their age
it did not irritate them nearly as bad as other eye creams i have tried
goes on smoothly,not greasy & it doesn't burn.
those fine lines are gonzo
not irritating to your eyes
all without irritating my eyes
doesn't leave any residue
it is not irritating to my eyes like most eye creams
it not only de-puffs
it does seem to brighten the entire eye area
it's my my favourite way
even though i normally have oily skin
sure it can get a bit more shiny on my nose
you can mix a bit of flash balm on the back of your h
i often have trouble with primers because i feel like they are so oily that my foundation will slide right off
i didn't have that problem with the flash balm
perfect for days when you're in a hurry or don't need a perfectly flawless face
i don't know if it like nourishes
i don't think it makes me look less tired or creates radiance
the texture is not thin enough to cover my face evenly with just a few pats it takes about half a dimes worth of product for me
it doesn't feel heavy
not greasy at all
it's not too heavily scented
i feel it's too thick
or if you forgot to moisturize before going to bed the night before this product undoes all of that
sometimes i don't even use makeup for the day.
even look to my skin
this stuff is magic is a tube!
i don't even have problems with breakdown or getting overly oily later in the day
the product does "sit on the skin
" since you aren't supposed to rub it in
not gummy as some reviews state
have not found this too oily to wear underneath makeup
as a primer, this doesn't excite me.
it's a bit of an odd product to use
it's not my favourite primer
doesn't come anywhere near hourglass mineral veil or cover fx
it's like it changes your tone before your eyes
one thing i don't like it the scent.
or is it my imagination?
am afraid i can't use it in the summer since my skin gets oily in the summer
it's actually a little tricky to not "rub this in
this product doesn't irritate my skin
i will always keep this is my beauty bag!
i dont like primers as they roll off my skin or make me look oily
i don't succumb to botox to erase the years so
neck what my friends $$$$ treatments can't do
it does not feel sticky or oily
does not make your skin oily
it doesn't cause any irritation
i don't know if i notice any brightening because my skin is usually a little blotchy with some acne marks
it is lightweight and doesn't irritate my skin.
i overused it a little
i just don't think i love it enough to replace my current hourglass primer
make sure to just pat into skin, don't rub.
it is not greasy
i can tell it makes my skin smoother
only when my skin is dull
as make up can be harsh on us older gals
you cannot imagine what in this potion can lift
haven't tried it under makeup.
it gets rid of all of my breakouts
it doesn't have a lot of bad chemical stuff in it
i like the scent, too.
this is meant to be used when your face/makeup seems to feel icky
when your makeup needs refreshing
doesn't mess up your makeup at all
never gets that "greasy" feel like some other moisturizers i've used
i don't use this everyday
i think it's too intense for me for daily use
it has made my skin so gorgeous- i don't even need a makeup primer anymore
be careful applying it though: do not rub it in
don't touch your makeup because it will become clumpy
it's like an instant face lift
however caution…don't use a lot of this as it can have a peeling effect on your skin
would suggest keeping those little beauty blotters in your pocketbook
only a dab will do!
not too heavy but just right for a creamy finish.
i just couldn't resist the smell
i usually don't wear foundation
makes me look like i just had a facial
expect all your imperfections to go away
all on days when i have used beauty flash balm
since my regular skin care routine doesn't have a mask
does not cause acne
very often i simply add some blush the the balm
usually have acne a lot
this cleanser really did tame my breakouts.
the only inconvenient thing about using it
i figured out it was this other drugstore cleanser i was using that was irritating my skin
you should always moisturize anyway
if you get it in your eyes it feels like shampoo
i don't think it's ever been this soft without exfoliating first
doesn't feel like it cleans the same
this is the only thing that really keeps hormonal break outs at bay
it's not drying either.
doesn't totally get rid of oil, but reduces it.
if you dont clean your face well
it's quite foamy when you use it with the clarisonic
doesn't smell all that bad at least
i can't believe how small my pores are in less than 24 hours
it does not make my face greasy.
i don't even need to use blotting papers anymore!
if i use it too often it dries out my skin
i would recommend this wash to anyone who battles acne
does sting a bit if it gets in your eyes.
this does a great job of cleansing my skin without irritating it
for me with fairly oily skin this just wasn't doing enough
i couldn't tell if i'd rinsed all of it off
maybe it's just my skin type.
t pores no more cleanser has worked magic on me
just be careful not to get this in your eye it will burn your eyes like acid
i always have a little issue with blackheads on my nose
i like the texture of the product too.
but beware, do not get in your eyes!!
even a microscopic bit of product is like ouch!
just be careful not to get the product in your eyes because it will sting
i think it's those same ingredients that will give you super clean
i would say that i have combination skin that gets oily throughout the day
used stuff my dermatologist gave me
the container is bulky but it works ok.
so this is mild enough that my face wont turn red when washing w/ it
i can already see my pores
yes it does sting the eyes so i am careful
either way my face is not greasy in the morning
i also like the way it actually lathers up
it does get in your eyes
especially if you use it in the shower
when it does, it stings.
so they clog up really easily
be careful not to get it in your eyes
it's always hard to tell what causes what with skincare stuff especially when you have weather/diet/other product variables
i do not know if my skin looks better because of the cleanser or in combination with the moisturizer
it's great for my oily skin
it didn't irritate my skin or cause any new breakouts
my face doesn't feel oily after using it
it doesn't leave that soapy residue or overdry my skin
i kind of expected it to do more for the blackheads on my nose
it has a fragrance, but did not irritate my skin.
it's a little on the pricy side
the products are great to clear your face without stripping away anything so no dryness
i also really like that it only takes two small pumps to create enough lather to wash your entire face
thats to be expected as it's getting rid of all the oils
in about a month i didn't have those annoying clogged
because it can get a bit greasy
it's all in the application.
my skin is even
forth on whether it's mild rosacea
this moisturizer couldn't be more perfect
it is not greasy or heavy
i don't use it all over my face
i can tell you you will get your most effective results with applying this pores no more cream with "patting" motions
hey us oily folks can dry out quick with the wrong products
my skin can't live without it.
only apply at night because it is really oily
there's much less breakouts
although i don't think it helped with the shrinkage of my pores
not only does it moisturize well without being too heavy
a skincare pro at sephora recomended that i use this since i have a huge problem with my pores being so large an having really oily skin
yet non oily moisterizer that feels great when you put it on after using the pores no more vaccuum cleaner
it makes your pores "no more"
leave your skin will neverbetter i lovet
my face isn't oily even though i am now using two skin creams
don't try to put makeup over it.
i do not know if my skin looks better because of the cleanser or in combination with this moisturizer
did nothing for my pores
the most significant thing is how it's gotten rid of all the little skin colored bumps that were all over my cheeks
i tend to steer clear of lotions for my face
the creams in that line stil made my skin break out a bit
i now use this lotion w/out fail at night
it does smell a bit "mediciney"
you can still use this product to make your skin look at it's best
now does the good doctor have anything to shrink fat from my body?
especially if you also use murad's acne body wash on it in the shower beforeh
t is difficult to find products that don't irritate my skin
t skin care line is the best however it's super expensive
when i use it i seem to have less breakouts.
it looks as if you have blackheads for 2 weeks
i think it's rich enough to use on combo skin as well
it didn't minimize my pores per say
there's a lot less blackheads on my nose
my skin really does look "refined"--much less red blotchiness
it has an smell not real unpleasant
this stuff makes your pores smaller
i couldn't extract them
even occassionally in my twenties now
instant gratification after washing off as you actually can feel the pores tightening
really does help make your pores appear smaller
my pores don't look so big
i could not get rid of the pimples
it does make a difference in my pores
it has a light scent to it but not bad.
helps with break outs and whiteheads too
usually nothing works for my skin
it's actually a treatment to encourage clear skin
although it's kinda expensive
plus it helps oily skin so much.
my pores aren't as big
i find it is almost like a primer
not overpowering at all
didn't apply enough sunscreen my first day of a week long trip
this stuff is magic in a bottle.
i didn't peel or burn.
my face feels like there's ice on it
doesn't cause breakouts when used on the face.
was not sticky at all
impossible to wear under makeup
didn't get razor bumps at all
i don't like the squeeze tube
it was amazing- it's cooling on contact
it does not work well for me unless my skin has had sun exposure
i don't typically get burned in the summer
it's a staple for my face
it's a must have product for the summer!
make sure to do you own test patch because it tingles
ed to that or if it's my skin just being its normal
if you keep it in the fridge is is extra refreshing when you put it on your skin
it neither irritates or makes me break out
hate the sunburns that inevitably come
doesn't leave a tight layer as say
lightly scented but this stuff is wonders.
burn easily so when i do burn i turn to this lotion
not greasy or tacky feeling
usually, it would have peeled, no question.
not only did it sooth my skin
remember that odd-smelling blue goo we used when we were kids
this was one of those sunburns that makes you whimper at the idea of a shower touching your skin
the packaging says you can refrigerate it if you need the extra punch
you can wear under makeup
even though i applied spf 70
it was nothing like the ugly mess that i’ve had with past sunburns that made me look like i had some kind of skin disease
it was light enough not to clog pores
it is a little sticky after i put it on
it also relieves an itching i may feel from dry skin or even bug bites
silly me wanting to get tanned so only used a spf 15 on my face
it's winter so no sunburn for me
after using my toner my face can get a little red so this works great
it's my summer vacation staple!
it just so happened that i put my acne face mask on from kate sommerville
my sunburn didn't sting anymore.
hydrates your skin like you wouldn't believe
i like the gel form because it's not greasy
this doesn't irritate my face or cause breakouts
even if you aren't sunburned
i can swap this out with my regular moisturizer too
it's never made me oily or broken me out
doesn't make my face breakout or feel oily
even if your not using it on sun-stressed skin
i will try it for other skin irritation too
don't put it on if you have a chill you will just get colder
most moisturizers make my face feel like it's on fire or cause me to break out
it doesn't irritate me at all
you will smell it when applying it
it's a little bit heavy
i don't wake up with crazy oily looking skin
it also does not cause me to break out even though i have super acne prone skin
something without a lot of chemicals
that being said it's still a great moisturizer if you prefer the heavier creams
the only things i don't care for are the scent
i don't have terrible acne
doesn't feel sticky or oily either
this does not irritate my skin
feels almost powdery after you apply
this cream is light doesn't cause no break outs
this cream does not just sit on my skin it actually hydrates
plus it doesn't have all the junk in it like parabens etc
it's almost like balm rather than a cream.
it's too thick to go under my makeup during the day
which this cream had not promised: my pores are gone
it doesn't get many pimples or breakouts
there isn't a time where my face isn't red.
it doesn't look or feel greasy all day long
no matter how much product i slathered on my face
on days i forget to use this cream
how it is not greasy on my face
it is not too greasy on me
if you don't like heavy moisturizers it may not be your thing
this is the only thing that would moisturize me enough to not be flakey
rich when you put it on
it does not sit oily on the skin though
if you feel like you've tried every moderately priced moisturizer under the sun
you may just need some ultra riche in your life
it's an amazing cream that's geared to lock in moisture all day long
it's not an offensive smell
i guess you could also use it on your parched visage if you have some sort of charmed face that never gets acne
it's kind i thick like the shea
it is not greasy
yet, it did not feel heavy or sticky.
although the cream feels a little bit sticky on your h
i hate creams that have a sticky or tacky feeling on the face
it doesn't leave that sticky product feel on your face like some do
it doesn't sting like some moisturizers do
as your skin absorbs the stuff
you'll see its got just the right consistency
it doesn't irritate me
it dries fast so you don't have to wait to put your makeup on
it's thick and a little goes a long way.
if you want to make it last even longer you can put a small dot in your palm
i wouldnt wear it in the day time under make up because it looks too shinny on my face
it doesn't irritate my skin at all
my skin is no longer flaky
doesn't make your face feel greasy at all
it doesn't make my skin feel greasy
it did not cause breakouts or irritation
this cream has no scent is not too greasy
i can even skip foundation primer potion
not heavy, not greasy,feels good.
it's thick and just a little bit greasy.
it's not as thick
could never find a moisturizer that gave enough hydration that lasted
for faces who cannot find enough hydration
if you press it into your skin it will not leave you too shiny
my face doesn't feel as tight
it helps me to get rid of my tiny blemishes in t-zone
plus, it doesn't clog up my pores.
while rich it didn't leave me too greasy or make me break out
can wear it under makeup
so rating it lower because it's too moisturizing/rich is just ridiculous
it's too heavy for my skin
i wouldn't recommend wearing this under makeup
it does leave me skin feeling a little greasy
since i use it at bedtime it doesn't bother me that much
i do not have oily skin not sure this would work for oily skin
i do not like the smell or the fact that it makes my skin tingle a bit at first
it won't make you look oily while you still have to meet people
this moisturizer doesnt sit on top of your skin- unless you put too much
not at all tacky to the touch
it's very thick, but that's what i needed.
it tends to make your face a bit shiny
it really isnt a good under-makeup moisturizer because it just comes off in a mess when you try to put concealer ontop of it to cover any blemishes
he's not stilling my body lotions anymore
for a guy who avoids man lotion at all costs
they have a tendency to break out his skin
doesn't cause his skin to develop acne
it's not greasy and can be applied often.
doesn't transfer to his clothing
not greasy at all.
doesn't leave a greasy feeling at all
while this lotion does not solve the problem
he's been using quite a few jack black products
sometimes men can be stubborn about taking care of themselves
which is usually done in shorts
it's not greasy and apparently absorbs quickly.
i even steal some for my self since the scent is not overbearing
the formula is not greasy
he says its not greasy
it's scented enough that he doesn't really need to wear a cologne if he applies this over his whole body
the thing it seems a some people forget that have written reviews for this product is that it's not icy cold or a5-35
i didn't buy this to get rid of aches
my boyfriend doesn't even need cologne after this
because it wasn't "manly" enough
won't overpower any cologne or body spray he might use
if nothing buy it for the scent
best of all it doesn't make me breakout like every other moisturizer under the sun
first time i applied it i knew my skin will most likely be even more oily since the moisturizer is thick
i've never used a night moisturizer because i've always had naturally oily skin
i know that sounds hokey, but it's true.
like to use it when my skin is oilier
not greasy oil free
feels like it's rich enough to soak in
this moisturizer does not clog my pores or cause breakouts
it's not much different from other "non-scented" moisturizers
it makes me so glowy in the morning
even over oily areas it's never caused congestion
mixes well with other face lotionsi usually put jojoba oil ontop if i want a super dewy facecons: sometimes can wear off around super dry areas if you arent using a toner its very expensive
don't use this if you have oily skin
don't want to add more shine
i do feel as though it's a little overpriced for daily coverage though
doesn't leave a ton of greasiness behind
this does not irritate my skin
i like the fact that it has spf 30 as some only have spf 15
it's a bit oily for me
does not leave a heavy feel
it did not make my face shiny
that's the one thing i hate about most moisturizers with spf
didn't seem to help my acne
it doesn't break out my sensitive skin
if your skin tends to be on the dry skin this probably isn't the face lotion for you
lucky this moisturizer doesn't do that
please note: i don't usually wear it under foundation or concealer
best of all it doesn't make me breakout like every other moisturizer under the sun
ok let's be real here- this is not a heavy duty winter moisturizer
doesn't leave the skin greasy
if you notice that it still looks "greasy" before applying makeup
i think the most important thing about sunscreen is you have to completely love it or you won't wear it
doesn't make my pores look bigger
it's a good non-greasy summer moisturizer
my #1 problem has always been that sunscreen tends to make me break out
makes my makeup run
it doesn't make my makeup run
it also never stings my eyes when i sweat.
it may feel slightly oily when you first put it on
and it doesn't affect my skin at all!!!
if your wondering my skin is combination
i don't feel the smell once it's on my face
this moisturizer does it's job
it's not too heavy or too light
does not clog my pores at all
so oily skin might not like?
i don't think it is heavy
the smell of spf makes me sick
doesn't leave that icky feeling or strong sunscreen smell like others do
this does not make me even oilier like a lot of sunscreens do
doesn't irritate my skin
it moisturizes but doesn't feel greasy at all.
with this moisturizer i don't feel greasy by the end of the day
i would say that it doesn't keep my complexion as matte as other moisturizers
so yes, it's pricey.
the product isn't too thick
the product doesn't cause breakouts
this one doesn't break me out at all---i put on a thin layer
another fave at sephora that doesn't break out my sensitive skin
i always cringe when i shell out the $65 for this product
doesn't run if i sweat
doesn't cause my skin to break out or become oily
it wasn't really rich enough to wear under my makeup alone before applying powder
doesn't leave any residue so you can apply makeup right away
it does occasionally make me a little shiny.
it's the only murad product i have experience with
it isn't greasy & doesn't break my face out.
it's not an unpleasant smell
it's the only moisturizer i use now!
it doesn't sit on my face for hours
it does not feel greasy after its in
i think for someone with oily skin who does not need much moisture
in the middle of the chicago winter i occasionally feel like it's not enough
this is annoying and messy.
most are oily when on face, but this isn't.
even i i don't put makeup over it i don't look like a total grease ball
it has been tough to find a moisturizer with spf that doesn't make my skin feel greasy throughout the day
this is a nice light moisturizer that will not leave you greasy
it is does not leave my face feeling oily
it does not seem to moisturize my skin enough
it's non-greasy & feels light on your face.
even though it's pricey
i rarely break out
i wouldn't recommend it for dryer skin or winter months because it does lather a fair amount
my main hesitation was that it wasn't as foamy as other cleansers
cleans and doesn't leave a dry feel on your skin.
its takes my makeup off super easy
if you're blemish prone you need to be using the blue formula
if you like oranges you'll fall in love with the smell
it doesn't feel over dried
my skin didn't feel as clean or as smooth
arin fragrance wakes me up a little too
i started to get acne again because i wasn't really getting a true deep cleanse
i truly do like this cleanser it just does not suffice for my acne-prone skin
gentle cleanser even though the tube is huge-it lasts forever
the texture is a light gel consistancy that doesn't foam alot
a face cleanser with a lot of suds is not good
this face wash does not give me that discomfort
it doesn't lather like you would expect it too
now i don't find it to be super foamy
even some eye make-up remover bothers me
it doesn't produce a lot of suds which is a good sign
that's not a reflection on this wash's cleansing ability
so don't plan on getting this for real exfoliation
they kind of feel like tiny pieces of plastic r
definitely not a daily wash
less bead'y things in the cleanser that use to feel like they scrubbed you
i always worry about cleansers drying out my skin
you know how some cleansers removes dirt
just remember that this is a cleanser
not a make-up remover
i don't have oily skin at all anymore.
i don't even have combination skin
it is not oily or too harsh.
doesn't make your skin feel tight after washing
too-you won't see any smudges of make up on the towel after drying your face
the only reason it's getting 4 stars is that it's costly
it doesn't dry out my skin like other cleansers can
this is a good product that doesn't leave any filmy residue
still searching for something that won't irrate my skin
f you have healthy normal skin you will love this or even skin that is not sensitive you can use this everyday twice a day
i don't really feel the beads when i use this cleanser
it just feels like a regular cleanser
it's a bit hard to tell if it's really having an effect on my skin because i am using so many products with vitamin c
it never dries my skin out no matter how much product i dispense
i didn't buy this for acne because i use other treatments when i break out
i think only the juice beauty has left my skin like this
i would recommend it to anyone because it's gentle
i will ever be greatfull for murad my face is so soft it's like new skin from when i was a teen
i got this product because i read that it would help reduce redness that stays with you after an occurrence of acne
it does not foam up
it's lightweight, that's what he likes.
while the cleanser doesn't sap away too much of the moisture on your face
it doesn't have a "manly" smell
this moisturizer i had 2 small red bumps-don't know which one caused it-
immediately began to have icky pimples filled with the yuck stuff
especially since its "wrinkle revenge" i dont have wrinkles
which i don't get often
does not have any kind of weird chemical scent
i did not find the lotion texture to be too thick or heavy for my skin
doesn't leave a greasy film like some wrinkle creams can
can't comment on smoothing
i love that it's not greasy
it's one of my favorites from this line of skin care
it's the only thing that has been able to make my skin as soft as a baby's
is not greasy at all
i can imagine it being fine for really oily skin during the daytime or if you want to layer it under a sunscreen
they either seem to do nothing for my dry skin or make me break out
felt "clean" not tacky after just a few minutes
i can't remember the last time i had a pimple or overly dry or oily patches
doesn't irritate/ clog eyes
it doesn't cause any shine either.
it's not too expensive
dermadoctor's products don't have any smell because they are fragrance free
just a dab is enough for your whole face
i don't really have wrinkles
it doesn't work well under my makeup
i think it's keeping it youthful-looking too
it is not greasy or heavy.
this product doesn't do much for my under eye darkness
downside is that it is greasy
it doesn't burn your eye like some eye creams do
i can wear it under makeup
as with any skin care product it doesn't work overnight
does not feel at all oily as it sinks into your skin
i will swear that my skin is brighter
doesn't leave a sticky feeling after it's dried
this does not sting or burn
when i can't catch enough sleep
it does not have a weird smell or oily texture
it wasn't greasy and went on very smooth.
it says it's a balm which i love because i have very oily skin
even my eyelids get extremely oily so creams don't work well for me at all because they tend to to look super oily after application
that's another thing-- you can use this balm on your entire eye area including your upper eye area
it is not your 100 dollar eye cream
doesn't irritate the eye area
i've even forgotten to put it on sometimes
cannot attest to that type of skin
doesn't interfere with my concealer
-must have product if you are prone to dark circles
liner doesn't slide off
it's not thick or greasy.
what the sales lady didn't tell me was how large the jar was compared to other eye creams
it feels great -- not too thick or greasy.
it's like a balm kind of.
does not sting or make your eyes water.
i've looked for a product that you can use on your eyelids
i love that you can put it on the eyelid too.
i love that i can wear it under my makeup or without makeup
i wish sephora would get their tease zone because it's great for oily skin
i can put on my concealer immediately with no problems
because i don't have puffy eyes or fine lines i can't speak for how well it works for those issues
yes i know it's an eye balm
i don't like most creams because they leave my face a grease slick which makes me look shiny
doesn't play well with makeup
i'll have to try the actual cream for the face because if it's anything like this eye balm
i do think the tissues around my eyes are not as slouchy as before
i also like that it does not leave a greasy residue
makes my mascara bleed out too much under the eye during the day
love that the wrinkle revenge doesn't make my makeup smear or bleed
doesn't give me the white bumps under the eye
that i can use it on my lids
doesn't give me those dreaded little bumps
i don't know if i have less wrinkles
this cream did not irritate my eyes with any scent
makes the wrinkles retreat is this stuff
so even though it's pricey
when i do wear concealer it doesn't look powdery because my skin beneath it is in much better condition
does not sting my eyes
it doesn't slide off
didn't really hydrate my eye area
don't have that much experience with eye creams
does not clog my pores
don't have the luxury of using it under my eyes too
my concealer never creases anymore
i rather have an eye cream that's a little thick
it's has just the right amount of retinol to keep those nasty crows feet from appearing
i forgot about the actual wrinkle
a $30 eye cream won't do much for you
it didn't reduce the wrinkles
guess it's improved the texture of my skin
i don't have wrinkles yet
need to go to that place that mediocre eye creams go to
love how i don't look sleep deprived any longer
it says it's for medium to deep wrinkles
i don't have dark circles
if you want to fill smoother
let's put it this way
can't attest to how well it would do on more severe wrinkling
plus doesn't break me out or cause those mila bumps
it's a little on the thick side
i clean out the spout as best as i can
if your eyes look tired it can age you.
even this wonder product can't erase my inherited eye bags
this eye creme does what it claims.
it does make my eyes water if it gets in them
i do not suffer from dark circles or puffiness
the eye cream does seem to minimize the appearance of the fine lines
rich enough but not goopy, it's just perfect.
this eye cream does everything it claims.
does not sting my eyes
it is not greasy
no irritations for me
i think it is a good daytime eye cream.
haven't seen it's "full" power
it's pricey, but i'm adding it to my regimen.
does not burn your eyes.
i generally don't have puffy eyes or dark circles
it doesn't rid of it completely
doesn't burn your eyes
it is not too heavy so my make up looks cakey.
he says it doesn't make him feel more oily compared to other face lotions he has used in the past
love that it's oil free!
only downside is the slight sting if you've just scrubbed your face
it doesn't feel like moisturizer when you touch it after it sets
spf moisturizers do not say to put on at night.
true to the name it does not leave my skin feeling oily or greasy
i occasionally use myself
most moisturizers make me feel so greasy in the t zone area
doesn't make my skin feel heavy or greasy
he has never used a moisturizer on his face bc he "doesn't like the feel of lotion"
the rest of his face can get quite oily
it's oil free, light and goes on well.
so you'll have one for the morning and night.
it doesn't cause any breakouts
it is unlikely to leave your skin shiny or greasy
wanted something that would make his face less oily
not greasy at all.
doesn't have anything irritating in it
this will not leave your face greasy
you can use it as a normal mask or leave it on all night when your skin really needs it
it's a mild exfoliants from what i can tell
the smell didn't linger
usually i feel like i need to wash my mask afterwards if it's too creamy
even though it's an exfoliating mask it doesn't leave me feeling dry
tend to get oily in my t-zone
this mask takes such great care of my sensitive areas i just can't see my mask routine without it
this is perfect for when you take a bath or if you just want to treat your self
this mask doesn't irritate my skin at all
it is not harsh on the skin
all the other exfoliates i've used just made my skin even more angry
ladies, you need this in your life!
this is the mask for you
it didn't sting, or burn or feel uncomfortable.
also-- don't mind the smell at all!
it doesn't bother me as that's the enzymes doing their job
i don't know why the gel like texture bothers so many reviewers
it never dries but stays tacky.
i actually like that it never dries down as it keeps a hydrating effect on my skin
using baby clothes does the trick
this stuff goes on like a "glop"
it's a bit of a pain to wash off as it's so thick
with my sensitive skin it does just what it's supposed to
sometimes i wear it to do errands.
this mask does really sting while it's on
there's no redness after i wash it off
thinks it smells like a cleaning product
like a gel because it doesn't make my skin feel tight or look like i have a mask on
she says it's helping reduce the acne on her face
i like to use when my complexion is looking a little dull
so easy to take off
it will give you a cool
i like this mask because it's soothing.
my skin doesn't look so distressed
this does not sting or make my face red
i can't wear foundation
i always feel like it takes off just dead skin that is clogging my pores
this mask does not irritate my skin.
or throwing out what you can't see in a dispenser you can't even see through
my nose is no longer peeling around it's edges after using this mask one week
my nose would peel alot, now nothing.
it was coming back so often that i couldn't keep exfoliating
it doesn't burn or tingle or anything
it's a clear gel mask
it does polish the skin a little bit
sometimes i don't want to wash it off because it smells so good
if i get a bothersome pimple i put apply this mask on
the mask does wonders
i can leave this on for 4 or more hours with it irritating my skin
i like the smell too
doesn't try or strip
it's prone to be red
i didn't notice any pinkness that some other people mentioned
i guess it depends on your sensitivity or if you scrub it off
it comes off easily if you just splash it with water
you do have to splash water for about a minute since it is pretty sticky
when you apply it it really wakes up your skin...
when it's time to wash it off you can see that most of the mask is gone
yes it is a pain to rinse off
your skin will look
be careful not to get it in your eyes
don't have one wrinkle or any crows feet
it's not as strong as some other aha/enzyme peels
whereas those other peels i can only use once a week if i want my face to keep from peeling
i like that you can use it under your eyes
i also love how it's free from nasty chemicals.
this product along with most other ole products did not irritate my skin
it is a little sticky but comes off clean.
doesn't look greasy if you apply the right amount
just a couple dabs is all you need
this still doesn't leave me greasy
can't use in the morning with my nars foundation
it's a little bit heavy
it'll melt off your face.
it is replacing my shiseido eye cream because this does it all
it did not soak in well and clogged my pores.
not fair to have wrinkles and pimples!
they all made my skin burn
although they didn't make my skin burn or turn red
not too heavy to make my skin break out
it's elusive what it can do
though i don't know yet if this cream is rich enough during harsh winter in mi
wrinkles seem to smooth out to some degree
it's thick but that allows you to use less.
does not leave a greasy feel on your skin
i usually just use it at night
not break out my sensitve skin
doesn't make me breakout or irritate my sensitive skin
does not clog pores
i can see an improvement on those icky neck lines
i don't usually have skin to compliment.
stays there for it's benefits
my face does not have that crepe paper feel
yet you feel like it's treating your fine lines
it's too pricey for me to use on a regular basis
and to top it all off, just a dab will do ya.
i always tend to forget to apply my moisturizer
it's rich without being too think
it doesn't sink into your creases for those of us with aging eyes
i get small bumps around my eyes if it's too heavy/oily
not too greasy/oily, either.
my mascara doesn't run when i use it
not greasy at all
moisturizes like nothing else
doesn't have any scent or irritate my eyes
not so oily that they slip off
the perricone is not as good under makeup as the ptr mega rich
it doesn't irritate my eyes
this cream actually gets rid of fine lines.
it is not greasy
and it doesn't burn my eyes.
doesn't get rid of wrinkles
it doesn't seem to do much for my wrinkles
never feels heavy or greasy
it's easy to apply and hydrates well.
almost everything i have ever tried irritates my skin
the other issue i've had is the couple of creams that don't irritate cause my eyes to puff
i've tried quite a few other eye cremes
wrinkles aren't my problem
it doesn't feel heavy or greasy plus i think it is brightening up my under-eye area
on hot days it does make my skin feel a little greasy
just a dab is all you need.
because you'll destroy your eyes
wearing to much eye makeup will destroy your eyes
i can't believe how many 20 year olds have deep eye wrinkles
there are no crepe wrinkles anymore
the jar lasts 4ever.
i don't have any wrinkles
extra rich eye cream that's good for nightime use
it is never irritating to my eyes
is light enough to use under makeup
fine lines"i didn't want a cream that created some sort of illusion on my face
this is one of the few eye creams that doesn't bother my eyes one bit
my crows feet weren't bad to begin with.
it seems to help hide them
i also loved the fact that it didn't aggravate my eyes or fog up my contacts
doesn't rub off on my pillow while i sleep
i want to tell them -- wear sunglasses
it's pricey but it works.
it does have a bit of a dewy look which i love.
no matter your skin type
it's suppose to be used nightly
a little goes a long way if you have oily/combo skin
doesn't seem to cause breakouts either.
doesn't burn or sting
it can be a bit sticky while it's absorbing
it doesn't have a greasy feel
doesn't leave a greasy heavy feeling like some creams do
i wouldn't say it's overpowering
it's just a bit too greasy/film-like
the only thing is that it can make your skin a bit oily
it will start to feel sticky
can rub off in little chunks when you use your fingers to apply makeup
doesn't leave me greasy!
its so hard for me to find good day creams that don't make me oily
not greasy at all which i love.
the only reason is didn't get 5 stars is because it is slightly runny compared to other moisturizers
does not make my acne prone skin break out
doesn't leave any oil behind
i would've never picked this out on my own because i usually go for thin
i don't think it's too heavy
kind of pricey but lasts me 5 or 6 months.
soft with a feel of literally lotion on your face because in all honesty that's what moisturizers do
ts more tolerable than a oil based one for anyone who doesn't like the feel of thick lotions
i can't find another cream that is as light
some areas would get really oily
it does not leave a greasy texture
so you can wear it under your foundation
that's me applying everyday
this doesn't make me break out or turn red
it's not greasy and a little goes a long way.
i don't find it to have a heavy scent
i honestly can't get enough of this cream it's very lightweight on your face
it's much thicker than a lotion
at first i didn't like how thick it felt
doesn't feel thick on your skin
not overpowering in any way
my skin doesn't feel greasy after i use it
doesn't make my skin greasy like a lot of other moisturizers do
it's not too thick
it doesn't leave my skin feeling oily yet it's really mousturizing
i usually switch to something with an spf anyway
i love this eye cream it's just perfect-not too thick
i feel as though applying it before makeup in the morning would be too greasy
it does help my skin
i feel like if i use it too much my skin gets super oily
this one isn't the mask
the smell is not overbearing
it's not visible on your skin
sometimes i find myself just leaving it on for most of the day because it's so soothing
probably not good if your skin tends to be at any of the extremes
if your skin just can't make up it's mind
otherwise it looks messy
you do have to rub it in a bit
otherwise, it's a great product.
it doesn't have spf
if o don't have a daytime eye cream
if you keep it in your bag for touchups you look amazing all day
as it seemed way too tacky
doesn't leave you with that "gunky"
this product is really for more " mature skin" you'll love it when you get in your 40's
i hate paying the crazy price for this little tube of cream
always drink out of straws
i don't feel like getting botox or fillers anytime soon
that may only apply to people who have darker skin tones as i'm about as pale as you can get
cannot be sure if it's from the cream or massaging it in
would recommend this to all skin types except maybe those with very oily eyelids who need that controlled
it's half the cost of the bobbi brown extra cream i had been using
this cream just can't be beat
doesn't interfere with my makeup
it is a bit greasy
not as absorbent as i would want it to be however it does help diminish fine lines around the eyes
whenever i wear it
it's not an eye cream that your skin absorbs quickly
it doesn't actually feel greasy
it doesn't crease or cake
it's in be-tween being too light and too heavy.
it's also nice to use the extra to pat onto your lips
can't say much for hope in a tube's anti-aging properties
bags so that's a miracle in itself
it doesn't make me puffy like some
it's a bit thick for the morning
lip pencils aren't cutting it anymore
sticky plumpers just look silly
it just does the job on the lines and wrinkles!
all my expensive stuff was irritating
it truly helps reduce the appearance of those nasty lines
it doesn't clog pores as some other eye creams do
i never thought i would be able to use moisturizer let alone eye cream as my skin is quite oily i can use this with oil-free hope in a jar
is doesn't seem to trigger break outs or clog pores
once you rub it n it does get watery
it doesn't feel like it disappears once it absorbs into my skin
i know it's in no way a miracle cure for aging
it doesn't burn and it's not too greasy.
you can't just smooth it over the eye
you'll end up pulling that delicate skin
way too irritating for me
you only need a dab
not irritating at all
you don't have to use as much as with other moisturizers
doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy
only use this at night because it makes my face too oily when i use under my makeup in the daytime
it doesn't cause any irritation to my sensitive skin
appearance so that's a plus
i cannot say enough about this facial soap!
it does not remove harsh
i want a cleanser that really does the job without being drying
i advise you to get the mild soap unless you really do have oily skin
as bar soaps tend to do
it really does work at removing all makeup from your face
i often have perfect strangers or people i've just met comment about my youthful skin
the best part is that it doesn't leave your face feeling tight after washing
it's not exactly a pimple war zone
it's crazy to look in the mirror
use it and you'll love it too!
i don't have the crazy shine i used to
my skin does not feel tight or drawn after washing
my cheeks don't feel dried out the way they usually do
it does take off makeup just as well as the liquid version
just don't forget to moisturize after
is a great mild cleanser for someone who wants just a regular cleanser
it also comes in a really nice case that prevents contamination or nasty soap build up
i am careful with the type of cleansers i use on my face
this soap really takes the oil
all i can say is wow--you will get the best squeaky clean skin ever
it doesn't overdry my skin
t doesn't go all over your countertop
but it's pretty cheap~
my eyes don't burn
makes my face feel clean yet not dried out.
doesn't leave a residue on your skin
it is a fine cleanser and doesn't dry you out.
it is a little inconvenient to use a bar of soap.
my makeup doesn't "melt off" as quickly like before
this doesn't leave any residue or make your skin feel tight
although i do find it stings my eyes a bit
i wasn't a fan as it dried out my face.
i don't know what prompted me to try out the extra mild soap version
even if you don't use clinique 3-step it's perfect
this soap goes a long way
it does not have any chemical smell
it is the only product that i have found that helps controll my oily skin
even when i go for facials they ask me what i use to clean my face because my face is so clean
almost everyone i see online always talk about oily skin
it's very foamy so you don't have to use as much as you would for liquid soap
only clenser that keeps me acne free
just can't leave the tiniest bump alone
would never use them because they would leave my skin so oily
although that method doesn't help his skin from being flaky
- does not leave an oily feeling-
it's fragrance free which we both like!
you can imagine i have tried a million eye creams
i don't really have issues with dark circles or lines
i love this product and it's not expensive.
don't have a ton of wrinkles
i don't think i have issues with the skin around my eyes
my mom always said that if i continued to scowl my face would stay like that
i don't have many wrinkles to begin with
sometimes eye creams seem greasy to me
also that it's not so greasy that my make-up smudges
doesn't bother my sensitive skin
this product doesn't help me with puffiness
i've had horrible luck trying to find eye creams to use before makeup that aren't greasy that wind up smearing my mascara
if i go very light on days when i do want to wear mascara
i can avoid the raccoon eyes yet still have nicely treated skin around the eyes that's not dried out
i do not wear foundation or do any other makeup on my face besides mascara
don't know how this would be layered with a primer like urb
it's a very lightweight lotion that doesn't feel heavy
it gives spf 30 so you're protecting your skin!
i don't know if it's wishful thinking
i can't keep my husb
it doesn't sting or "travel"
you don't need a lot to cover the eye area
my eyes don't seem so tired
i mean many eye creams
although they're not applied to the eye area
it doesn't act like an eraser
it doesn't sting like other br
it is not greasy
this works great for contact lens wearers too as it does not burn at all
i noticed that my concealer stays on much long.
that's the only skin care i use
have trouble finding skin care that does not irritate my skin
the only thing i don't like about it is that it is not so creamy
is not easy to get out of the jar
it doesn't irritate my eyes
i like it because it's light weight
it has a tendency to cause my pores to clog sometimes because it's so thick
doesn't leave a greasy feeling under makeup or eye concealer
yes there is dirt on the cotton pad
i dont usually like or use clinique
my face is not oily anymore.
cleaned up a lot of the blackheads i tend to get in my t-zone
i recommend immediately following with moisturizer so your skin doesn't get dried out
it's even gentle enough that if he is too lazy to put lotion on after
i can't imagine doing that after a toner
who always complains that he can't find a good facial routine
i don't feel stupid using moisturizer
it doesn't overdry my skin
don't like the dispenser.
that is unfortunately so oily that if i'm not careful i end up breaking out by proxy
it's hard to get the rest of the foam out when it gets low resulting in waste
or "my makeup residue was still there"
you guessed it....cleanse.
refreshing that won't cause breakouts
i get at least 2 pimples
saves me so much $ on makeup because i don't need to conceal or cover up anything
i recommend this cleanser to anyone who lives in a hot
it takes off any type of makeup i have on
it leaves that squeaky clean rubbery feeling which can be too intense for some people
even tho it cleans to the bone
it's all i would use to clean anything involving the face:
it also doesn't feel oily
i will say again it's the best makeup remover out there especially for the price
it's difficult to find a cleanser that either doesn't make it worse
it is practically without any fragrance which for me is a big plus
the places i'm oily or have breakouts it helps to get rid pf oil
it doesn't irritate my skin
my only gripe is the flip-top tube.
i still use this when i travel because it's hard to travel with a bar of soap
very cleaning with a squeaky clean feel that i have never had before
t is often hard for me to find a cleanser that doesn't give me hives or a rash
this is the only facial cleanser that really takes everything off
if you feel like it doesn't do the job leave it on for a bit while you wash your hair or something
doesn't smell as strong
it's hard to get out
you only need a tiny bit to lather it up
it's gentle but does what it's suppose to.
i don't wear any makeup
i never had good luck with clinique cleansing bar or gel
i do not have breakouts when using this cleansing foam
as you're supposed to with the balm
there is rarely any makeup left on my face
this one works to even clean off my mascara
"tacky" if that's the right word
it doesn't get quite all the cheap drugstore makeup for some reason from what i've noticed
it goes on so easy and washes off well.
it does not dry it out or leave a yucky residue.
it smells a little bad
it's so moisturizing on its own that it's not always necessary
because it's really overkill for morning face washing
i find that those ingredients tend to irritate my skin
really clean my face without drying it out or feeling like it's been pull back because it's so tight
though it's true i use the clinique oily skin formula cleanser after it
the only downside is that it can't be used to remove eye make-up
doesn't break my skin out after using it
it actually cleans your face
it's one thing that i have used that is foamy
doesn't make my face feel dry.
this product not only cleans your skin
my skin sometimes seems to break out from harsh products
this product really removes all makeup in one wash
it makes me sneeze
not sure why the sneezing
i don't find that it's drying
just don't get it in your eyes
i seem to try other cleansers
and works to was your makup brushes too.
i don't really use it to take off makeup
it's nice to know that i have no leftover makeup on my face
this stuff lasts forever
i very rarely have to use any eye makeup remover in addition to this cleanser to get it off
this cleanser is the only thing that takes everything off
highly recommend for those that want their face to feel squeaky clean after washing
i simply haven't found something that can beat how well this cleanser removes makeup
although it says you can apply the face wash without using any makeup remover
couldn't believe the difference doing that one extra thing in my nightly skin routine
recommend it to anyone wanting to add that extra clean feeling
and does not clog drain!
this cleanser never causes break outs
my only concern is that it doesn't wash off your makeup in one turn
i prefer to use this in the shower because it's really foamy
tends to get everywhere otherwise
it's actually one of the only things my super sensitive skin will let me use
i just thought it was a mediocre facial cleanser until i started using it for all it's uses
facial cleanser very gentle it's even ophthalmologist tested so you can even use it to remove your eye makeup
you only need a dime size amount it lathers insanely well
i wear makeup just about everyday
i put on a small dab of face lotion because it does make your face feel a little tight
however i don't feel it treats the skin of any blemishes or anything
it feels like a cream which for my oily skin might not be a good idea
rather than using this as a makeup remover i use this as my morning
i don't need make up removers anymore except for the eye area
i mean no perfume
what is good for some people that doesn't like fragrances in the products
this didn't irritate my skin or add to my reaction at all
i usually remove my makeup before using this cleanser
i don't struggle with dark circles unless i've had a long night or don't get much sleep
not sure if it diminishes puffiness
i like that it is not greasy.
this eye cream doesn't magically fix the dark circles
what high end eye cream isn't?
even with only 3 hours of sleep sometimes
never makes my eye makeup run
it's really not heavy enough for night time wear
you're ready to put on your eyeshadow
isn't so rich that it causes milia
cannot use a lot of products on my eyes
doesn't feel oily or greasy afterwards
i don't like to dip my finger in the whole bottle
it didn't get rid of the dark circles immediately
i can really lather it over my eyes without any eye irritation
after using this cream sometimes i don't even feel the need to put on concealer
when i wear this under concealer it doesn't crease even after many hours
i don't have concerns with bags or dark circles
it's not going to get rid of under eye circles
if you had dryness on your eyelids this will really help you
bags that i occasionally notice
this eye cream does not help with dark circles however most definitely moisturizes under eyes
it's perfect for daytime and even at night!
my makeup doesn't cake around where i've used eye cream
does not sting the eyes
it's a fine everyday cream
it usually messes up my concealer
you pat this on
doesn't burn or sting, and it absorbs well.
i don't believe any eye cream is a miracle in a bottle
don't have a wrinkle in sight or dark circles
i don't think they are going away unless you take more drastic measures like botox
you'll have the jar for a long time
why hide it when you can get rid?
if it were edible id eat it too
does not irritate my eyes
it stays where you put it and doesn't migrate.
though--the pot is kind of annoying
just make sure you wash your h
doesn't irritate my eyes
this doesn't break my under eye area out
it doesn't make my concealer crease when i put makeup on top of it
i can't use it on my upper lids however
because it makes them itchy
it does seem to brighten the eye area
it's really a gel-cream
i don't have terrible dark circles
this eye cream doesn't promise all sorts of miracles
i must say it does nothing for dark circles or puffiness
i gave it 4 stars because of there is no spf in the cream
make them all nasty
i can say it certainly removes puffiness
i always do have crack eyelids
i don't magically look like a super model
if you already have issues with exfoliating your eye areas i would definitely skip it
only 4 stars as it does nothing for my puffiness or dark circles
never irritates my eyes either.
sometimes if i am not careful applying the cream
the solution is simple: just don't stick this cream in your eyes
normally he doesn't like to put on any lotion or cream on his face
he thinks it not greasy on his face smell is not heavy
subtle enough that you honestly can't smell it unless you are directly smelling the skin
also doesn't leave a sticky feeling
my guy hates moisturizers because he doesn't like the greasy feel they have
guys tend to be creatures of habit
after balking at first because he though is was sissy stuff
regular sunblock anywhere on his body is irritating to his skin
this is the one product he has used that has good sunscreen in it that did not irritate his skin one bit every use
don't be suckered in to paying for a moisturizer because it is labeled for women
can get flaky when he's stressed out
because he won't buy or apply sunblock
this seems gentle enough for even him
the moisturizer doesn't make his face break out
not sticky as other men products
he says it's not shiny or greasy.
it's ideal for men skin protection.
it's also not greasy or oily
it doesn't feel like there's an spf in this
he likes it a lot-it's a little greasy
it's gonna sound weird
it's not greasy or smelly.
i know men don't like oily stuff
my boy friend's skin is not that oil
don't leave greasy feeling
it is the only lotion that doesn't cause him to break out in a bright red rash
he hates anything thick
he loves it but says its a little oily.
he likes to use this product because it's not too creamy
he looks like he's 24/25
he's always used clinique's maximum hydrator
my hubby hates putting anything on his face that feels heavy or greasy
ok sooooo i have really sensitive acne prone oily skin an i haven't liked any of the moisturizers i've invested in in the past this works wonders plus for the price compared to others it's worth it an reasonable in my opinion
it doesn't leave me oily or break me out.
because it definitely controls my oily face
i don't like the layering a lot of products on my skin
it doesn't feel like anything is on your skin
even if it is a light gel
does not make skin greasy at all
it's just the right amount of moisturizer to go under my makeup
there's no spf in it
i like how it doesn't have a scent.
doesn't cause my makeup to slip
it's fragrance free, but i like the smell it has.
i don't like moisturizers that feel heavy
it doesn't do much to improve the appearance of my skin
it makes it baby
it doesn't make me oiler than usual
as i figured that if my skin got slightly oily
my skin isn't greasy anymore
my skin doesn't look extra oily at the end of the day
regular skin everywhere else
sometimes i even skip the primer step
doesn't leave my skin greasy at all
i've also noticed that my skin doesn't get very greasy throughout the day
most beauty gurus or workers at sephora always tells me that i need to moisturize before applying makeup or just on a daily basis so your skin will hydrate
it wont clog pores either
at night it's so lightweight
airy that i hardly feel i added anything excessive
it doesn't roll up
it didn't cause any breakouts for me unlike the argan oil
i can't praise this gel enough.
not feel anything sticky
it's not greasy and absorbs into the skin fast.
it doesn't really make the skin feel like omg smooth
it is not thick or greasy whatsoever
none seem to work for my normal/oily skin
many made me too oily
can tend to get oily at some points throughout the day
did not stick to my pillow in the slightest bit
doesn't leave a slimy residue like many other moisturizers
it doesn't have a smell
its the only face lotion that does not break my skin out
doesn't clog my pores
needless to say my skin is a disaster.
everything i put on my skin ends up clogging my pores or give me irritations
it doesn't feel heavy and it's hydrating.
i could never get makeup to look as natural
even without makeup my skin doesn't get oily during the day anymore
it's more thick like a gel
mattifies is enough to make someone with oily skin in love with their skin
let me talk about my skin a little bit: i have large pores on my very oily nose
even under my makeup
it gives my makeup something else to hold on to so that i can blot my skin without worrying about my makeup separating
it even serves as a primer because of its slightly tacky texture before it dries down
doesn't conflict with my oil based cleanser or foundation
my only qualm is that since it's winter it doesn't provide enough hydration
i think it's trying to be fragrance free
this moisturizer does not break me out or leave me feeling oily
wouldn't make me more oily
it's defiantly not a heavy cream
you may need to moisturize more at night so your skin doesn't get too dry like moi
it can get so oily it's just plain embarrassing
have found they leave a tacky
it's the best for my oily skin!
doesn't leave a residue on your face like i've found with other moisturizers
so you can switch to the lotion formula when the winter is coming
i find for me it provides enough moisture that i don't have to use a separate night moisturizer anymore
30's who doesn't need a heavier cream yet
doesn't make my skin feel greasy
it absorbed quickly and can't really smell it.
i love that it doesn't smell like a perfume
because it's just a mask
it's lovely, but not something on my short list.
it's cooling when it goes on
i am not sure if it's pieces of rose petals
it doesn't bother my sensitive skin
i want to bathe in this stuff!
you can actually see the rose petals which made me feel fancy
it's super cooling especially when you walk by your ac
only thing you should be careful about is not spilling it everywhere
the sugar is fine enough to do its job
it doesn't irritate my skin
my wallet doesn't appreciate the price of course
i prefer to use it after a deep exfoliation with something like kate somerville exfollikate
there's a rose mask i prefer from the body shop which looks
i actually use this as a night cream.
i feel like it's a bit expensive
it usually gets flaky, red and just icky overall.
i love how it's gentle enough to use whenever you want
doesn't make your skin tight while it sits
once i remove it i do not even need to moisturize
(can't imagine that being harmful).
thought it would be gimmicky
this is my #1 mask
i also find i need less moisturizer because my skin doesn't feel dry after using this
it didn't irritate my skin at all
it doesn't smell too strong or bad
it's does add a certain luxury
i didn't wash my face one night
the great thing with this mask is that a little goes a long way since the consistency is kind of like a thin jelly
either from being winter/wind chapped or from a cosmetic product that didn't agree with my skin
it doesn't cause flare ups either which is a huge plus
this is such a refreshing mask to put on your skin
don't let the fact that it's a bit different from other face masks discourage you from trying this
knowing how rosewater helps combat oil i decided to put it in my morning routine
when i do get a pimple or two
this mask is everything!
which tends to get red
it fells so light on the skin that you wouldn't think it works
try it and you'll love it.
4 oz it's really not that bad
acne-prone skin that can sometimes get really irritated from my acne products
also a nice change up from a lot of the clay based masks i use since it's like a jelly without the sticky feeling
now i usually despise rose anything
it says to wash off however i usually let it sit on my skin
i've never had a reaction or dirty pours after doing so
it's light enough for daily use
or at least it doesn't exacerbate any issues with breakouts
no white film, not greasy...it's simply the best.
you can buy their eye cream or night cream with it
i don't think it's unpleasant
it's not sticky either!
even though i have super oily skin i loved it
my skin craves it now!
this lotion comes in a plastic bottle with a pump that always dispenses the right amount
there is no white cast whatsoever despite the high-ish spf of 30
not greasy for my combination skin
this is the one lotion with high spf that i wont have bad reactions to it
least irritating 30 spf product i have found
not oily all day long
i like it because it's not sticky
you can get matching eye cream too
not too greasy nor sticky
i sometimes just wear my bienfait on my clean skin
this lotion doesn't quite cut it
it isn't as messy
t really isn't bothersome to me
does not clog my pores
the spf of 30 is great because i don't have to worry about forgetting the sunscreen
i never would wear tank tops because of it
it doesn't burn my eyes
it is light snd there is no greasy feeling.
doesn't cause my pores to clog
i wear this under my makeup
it does leave your skin a little shiny after you use it
it doesn't irritate my skin
it's not at all heavy
it doesn't cause breakouts either!!!
don't put it on your lips
because if it gets in your mouth it tastes yucky
it can be hard to get rid of the taste
it's superlight and just sinks into skin.
doesn't clog my pores
t's difficult for me to find a moisturizer that doesn't make my skin break out
or make my skin too greasy
doesn't make my skin look greasy
it's very light and not at all greasy.
i love how this one just takes off mascara like bam
i don't have to scrub or rub anything.
really actually no texture except baby smooth skin
this product is not greasy
he likes it enough to keep using it if is there over regular body lotion
the lightweight texture is not something one would normally think of as a night cream
it's not the most ideal for my routine
basically if you're trying to get your man to use moisturizer
nice lotion, not too heavy.
i always have such a problem finding makeup removers that don't irritate or make my eyes burn
it does such a nice job of removing all of my eye makeup with no irritation
it doesn't burn my eyes
all that residue that tries to hangout from your mascara is gone
this product completely melts off all of your makeup even the most stubborn eyeliner
lipstick plus it lasts you forever
it doesn't strip my skin
it doesn't make me break out or dry out my skin.
it's great even for oily acne prone skin.
i don't have to use makeup wipes anymore because this works better
i do find it can irritate my eyes when removing mascara
it melts away any makeup i have on.
i've tried so many makeup removers
this balm honestly takes off all my freakin makeup
there is never any leftover makeup
i love it for the eye area because i don't have to rub hard so there is no irritation
unlike many other balm, it won't cause any acne.
i don't use this everyday
yes it does take off stubborn mascara!
it doesn't leave any residue
even gets the super tough waterproof mascara off in one try
needs a lil bit time to melt down which is acceptable
it really take all your makeup all gently
i really recommend if you need a quick makeup remover before bed
i don't like using a towel
t was a little hard removing the oily after feel
it does a great job removing eyeliner
it's a little heavy on the eyes of you massage it too intense
honestly i've been watching makeup gurus taking they're make up with this balm
when you actually take it off with a make up wipe it makes your face feel so hydrated
i know it's not a moisturizer
i do find after rinsing i still need to give my face a quick wipe to really get rid of absolutely everything
no hard scrubbing requires especially your eye makeup
i usually wear makeup everyday to work
this gets rid of even my mascara within one wash without having to rub off my skin
melts all makeup away so easily
doesn't irritate my eyes.
this stuff takes make up off so fast and easily!!
i love that if i do swatches on my arm i don't have to scrub forever
just rub a bit of this in
i will never both to try another makeup remover.
it does blur your eye, but i can bear it.
other than that, it's perfect.
i prefer this to other oil cleansers because it's not messy like liquids
this stuff didn't dry out my skin or leave it feeling oily
i hope clinique never stops making this balm.
the balm doesn't hurt the eyes at all
in your eyes if you don't wash your face after using it
off easily and doesn't hurt my eyes.
doesn't hurt existing lashes or irritate my eyes
i don't feel like any product gets wasted like with squirt bottles or having to use a ton of cosmetic circles
i can see it strips all my makeup off
doesn't feel overdrying or irritating
when washing your eyes make sure you thoroughly rinse the product off or your eyes will seem foggy for a couple minutes
less messy if it was in a tube or dispenser
this stuff is amaze balls for removing every trace of eye makeup
even bits that wouldn't come off with just a makeup wipe
it doesn't irritate it
it's just an annoying little side effect
the only thing is sometimes it gets in my eyes
i don't have to scrub
doesn't burn or irritate the eye area
i've never had a makeup remover work as well as this does
my mascara comes off like it was barely even there
i don't have to scrub
with just a little bit of this it completely dissolves the make up
generally, i wear a full face of makeup everyday.
they can't beat the cleansing power of this remover
you'll find that it's so easy to use
no other makeup remover has ever done that for me
so the jar lasts a while
i wear a eyeliner that nothing seems to get off except this
your face shouldn't feel greasy afterward if you've done it right
i dread wearing makeup sometimes because of the taking off process- this replaced all my products
products i don't feel greasy or oily it's definitely the best
you don't need a lot of this balm to remove a fully face
i wear a lot of eye makeup which makes taking it off a pain especially mascara
don't wanna take hours to remove makeup??
even the they're real mascara that's normally so hard to get off
usually i'm iffy about putting oils on my face
it doesn't leave that oily feeling
wunderbrow that doesn't budge for anything melts right off
i can't wait to wash off all my makeup just to smooth this
easy to use, just slap on rinse off.
does not rip off the oils from your skin
although sometimes it gets it my eyes
honestly i have a combo oily tzone
pair it with the makeup eraser it's a match made in heaven
does not hurt or irritate my eyes while scrubbing off my layers of product
it does not burn your eyes or leave a weird film
doesn't strip my skin of any moisture.
the only downside is it does not remove mascara very well
it's got safflower oil in it which does wonders for your skin
plus this stuff lasts forever!
i also like the fact that there's no fragrance in this product
it takes off all your makeup even stubborn eye makeup especially waterproof makeup
im never using makeup remover wipes anymore.
works like a charm even on waterproof makeup.
not only does it remove your makeup
it removes your makeup with just a little amount
it does not clog pores
my concealer doesn't crease at all since i've been using it
it moisturizes but doesn't feel greasy at all.
this also doesn't make my makeup come off or smear as some other eye creams do
too soon to tell if it erases wrinkles
does not leave the skin greasy
be careful to not to get it in your eye
after each use there's some cream at the mouth of the dispenser
i can even skip the concealer now!
doesn't roll off when i apply makeup
love how it gets rid of dark circles
not only do you get sun protection
this stuff doesn't hurt my eyes when i sweat like many other spfs do
but it really stings when it seeps into my eyes!
which is good because i hate wearing concealer
now it's my daily eye cream
i really like this cleanser bc it doesn't ever leave my face dry
i wouldn't recommend it for taking off makeup bc it is pretty light
on the days i don't use this murad eye cream people ask if i'm tired
even if i do it gently
it's light enough to provide a good base for make-up
is not overly greasy so that concealer stays put
i can always tell the difference if i stray with a different sample cream
the pump sometimes sticks a bit
love that i don't need to follow up with sunblock
not irritating, doesn't make my eyes sting.
if your eyes are stinging or burning you are using too much
if you use too much it will irritate your eyes
doesn't run into eyes or sting delicate skin like others i have tried
it's hard enough to get him to wash his face every day
i still like this cream because it's gentle
my dark circles are almosts gone
my eyes are not puffy anymore.
and, it doesn't make my makeup smear.
doesn't sting my eyes if i accidentally get any in them
at first i thougt it was a little sticky
try not to put too lose to your eyes as it does sting a little if you get into your eye
feeling kind of tired/ugly at the time
although it's a bit pricey
the only description i can give is that it's like they tried to make an icky-smelling cream smell nice
didn't add enough fragrance
be care ful not to rub your eyes after just putting it on
it is not a night cream.
otherwise i break out from sweat
i never seem to like facial cleansers as much as i want to
everything else i use is either too heavy or too drying/irritating
i also love that it is foamy but soap free.
i don't think it's great for heavy makeup
doesn't take off heavy or waterproof make-up
i want something fairly natural that won't strip my skin
it does not leave a soapy film on my skin
it's difficult for me to find products that don't irritate or dry my skin out
can't expect more from a cleanser
it's not the best at preventing oily skin throughout my day
although my skin isn't too bad
try it, you'll love it!
this product lives up to it's name
t's difficult for me to find a cleanser that doesn't irritated my skin or dry it completely
because it makes the product even more foamy
i needed something gentle that could still remove makeup
this does not strip my skin of oil
won't sting if it gets in your eyes
the foam keeps its foaminess long enough to wash your whole face
which wasn't really effected by this cleanser
i little annoying for a product of this line
this is it -- and it's all natural.
i prefer very mild cleansers as i know how that "squeaky clean" feeling is actually very drying to your skin
this cleanser doesn't make your skin feel dry or taught afterwards
i appreciate that it's paraben free.
plus, it's almost 100% natural.
it does an okay cleansing job.
i can't speak to makeup removal as i wear very little
it's not for removing eye makeup
i don't think this takes off makeup
caudalie neither dries my skin out nor irritates it
i can even use this over my eyes after using eye makeup remover
certainly not a makeup remover.
this stuff does the trick without drying my skin out
i can't even use a different detergent without breaking out
i can use this cleanser no matter how my skin is misbehaving
it doesn't aggravate any breakouts i might have
love how it's so gentle
it's an easy to use
you dont have to shake the bottle
however i cant recommend using this to remove make up as its quite gentle
can't live without this cleanser
however,it isn't great for removing makeup.
love how it doesn't sting my eyes if a bit gets in
what i love about this cleanser is it cleanses my face without drying it out or breaking it out either
foamy enough that i don't have that "did i get enough soap" feeling
it does not irritate the skin
does not remove makeup well.
because i had a really bad break out when i became allergic to makeup
when i wear makeup
it does have a fragrance but i don't mind it.
i think this could be a better face wash for those with oily skin
it won't remove makeup
i usually use about 2 big pumps on my clairsonic
this cleanser doesn't dry out my skin or cause any irritations
i saw a comment that said it didnt lather so you should lather it in your h
i usually use just water or a oil-based balm to wash the other time
after using it just instantly my skin gets soooo smooth
when it's on your face
it doesn't exactly lather
i love how it cleans my face
i hate those cleansers that with you with a tight feeling afterward
this stuff takes off all of my makeup--waterproof liner
doesn't leave a trace behind
not overpowering like so many other face washes out there
it didn't get rid of my cake
i could use almost any kind of cleanser
didn't want something designed for "dry" skin only
let's get real about cleansers.
unlike most male-centric products doesn't smell like cheap cologne
this was gentle enough on my face that it didnt bother it
i always feel squeaky clean but never dry.
doesn't irritate my skin at all
my face always breaks out and i have rosacea.
doesn't cause any irritation
and i have tried so many face washes.
plus you can't beat the price.
doesn't make my skin flare up
everything else dries out my face.
because extra mild is too oily
doesn't irritate my skin at all
the only thing i should note is after a while the soap became a little watery
it's mild enough to prevent irritation
it sometimes can leave my face a little tight if i don't moisturize afterward
i cant get enough of this cleanser
i love this cleanser it doesn't irritate my eyes
i actually have rather oily skin
it will not give your skin that "squeaky clean" feeling
i mainly use it as a makeup remover because i don't really see the purpose of it
it doesn't irritate skin or eyes.
it's great at the end of the day to remove excess makeup
it's gotten rid of my oily skin
it doesn't make my face feel dried out either!
i don't get as many breakouts as before
i rarely get acne anymore
this is literally the only face wash i can use!
plus since it is fragrance free it does not irritate my skin
immediately you notice it is not like the mild soap
it doesn't always remove all of my eye makeup
i doubt it would remove waterproof makeup
i like this cleanser enough.
doesn't strip my face of it's natural oils
i don't use harsh cleansers that strip oils as i find this worsens the problem- skin tends to overcompensate for the lost oils
it is not harsh on the skin
doesn't leave skin feeling stripped.
i actually used it to clean my beauty blender to see how well it removes makeup
this is no longer the miracle pore eraser it used to be
the pore coverage isn't 5-star anymore
this does not make me oily at all
no exaggeration i used to squeeze them super hard
sometimes your skin might have to get used to the tea tree oil at first
which has a lot of fine lines that wont disappear with drinking lots of water
they either don't help with minimizing the appearance of my pores or they don't go on even
i feel like it just didn't cover my large pores
my face did not get oily
this trick works with all my makeup!
this primer routine really makes my makeup-wearing days more comfortable because i'm not concerned about the oily slick i'm guaranteed to see in about 2 hours from application of my makeup
this is a primer that is not meant to smooth all over your face
actually have oilier skin
it's pricier than other primers
another thing i noticed is that it's a darker nude
once i apply concealer or anything it's not a good look
the rest is outrageously oily with pores so huge
i don't really wear makeup
it's not heavy or greasy
this pore minimizing primer does exactly what it's supposed to
i don't usually leave comments
while i don't suffer from crazy big pores i like minimizing them anyway however i fell for this primer more because of what it does for my fine lines
can't wait to finish it to buy the 1.7oz tube.
the smell of tea tree oil than this product might bother you a bit
just a small dab of this stuff
there's only a couple of primers that i really love
it didn't irritate my skin or break me out
can't live without this primer.
it hides my pores so well without me breaking out
for days when i don't feel like caking my face
don't think it really helps mattifying for long or prolong the wear of my foundation
my issue actually isn't pores
because i never notice my pores
however, the faint smell is kind of eh.
it does get covered with my makeup though
if you're super oily
it doesn't make me oilier like the benefit poreffesional
i can wear it alone w a little blush
softening pores that sometimes i can even skip foundation
i tried other primers to get rid of it
the only bad thing is the smell
was hook i have a very oily t-zone with big pores
it's my go-to primer now!
it's the only thing that minimizes my pores
especially if i skimp on sleep
i used it the next morning with nothing else except my highlighter no foundation no setting spray or powder
never makes me greasy
does not clog pores
makeup will not budge unlike other heavy moisturizers
i am on the look out for a moisturizer for night time that is not oily for me
the one thing i don't like is the packaging
it doesn't have a cap
only moisturizer that doesn't break me out.
you really don't need to use more than 1-2 pumps of the product to cover your face
it's working as an anti aging cream too
my makeup lasts longer bc of that
only moisturizer that doesn't cause my skin to break out
i just cant justify almost $80/month for a moisturizer
doesn't sting or clog pores if i get it near my eyes
seems to plumb up my wrinkles so they don't show so much
even the bad ones between my eyes
i've noticed that my skin doesn't seem nearly as oily at end's day
don't find it to be too heavy for my skin
some lotions tend to make my break out more
don't know how well it'd work for people with dryer skin type
so far i've found that there is no daytime lotion i can use that will satisfy the dryness
i always use a light lotion like this to my entire face
try not to go with a moisturizer that is too heavy
a bottle lasts forever too
doesn't clog my pores
moisturizes, but doesn't create more oil.
it gives my face just enough moisture with out feeling or looking greasy
also that while i have it on my makeup doesn't change colors mid day
it's not greasy at all and absorbs instantly.
i know it's airtight for quality reasons
it doesn't make my skin greasy at all
it soaks in quickly & doesn't feel greasy.
cleared up my acne that had been really resistant to anything else i tried
i do not like the other cleansers that leave my face either too oily/creamy or too clean
i notice that it does remove all of my makeup
i wouldn't call it greasy
i cannot feel any leftover product
i prefer to use a makeup wipe to start
i only wish it wasn't quite so fragranced
yet never dries my skin
it doesn't irritate any part of my face
who steered me to this product when i asked for a mild makeup remover/cleanser that would not irritate my superdry winter skin
flaky skin i can proudly say this helped get rid of all of the flakiness
this doesn't keep me away
if you do not want a scented cleanser
it does not strip away the oils your skin needs.
though: it will not remove all of your makeup
this cleanser doesn't strip my skin
you really don't need eye makeup remover with this
not even ofr waterproof makeup
another lancome product i use on my lazy days.
t's nice to know that when i feel kinda lazy before bedtime i can just manually lather this creamy cleanser on my face
w/out rinsing after doesn't leave me icky
i don't think it would work very well for oily skin
it does not irritate your eyes at all!
it does remove all of your makeup without any effort
i barely even need to moisturize afterwards.
does not leave any greasy residue
i don't even put moisturizer on after cleansing with this stuff because it makes my skin feel so smooth
when my skin doesn't like something
it's doesn't strip your skin of it's moisture
it can be used as a regular rinse-off cleanser too
it doesn't smell chemical at all to me
at first its so sticky and you feel it all day!
its not sticky anymore i suppose it was trying to get tid of the bad stuff on my skin
has no real color to it so hides well under makeup
i don't always even use this with any moisturizer
during the day it's hydrating enough on its own
goes on super smooth, not sticky at all.
my deep wrinkle btwn my eyebrows it's almost gone
i don't look "tired"
i like the idea of a serum that also does eyes--let's see if it's true
i can't wait to see how my face looks like after i get the overnight facial
doesn't irritate my eyes at all.
one squirt is all you need
it does leave your skin a little sticky
it doesn't matter because i put on moisturizer after
i decided to only use it at night because it makes my skin oily
it does feel a little tacky when you first apply it
i got it for it's brightening properties
it doesn't give you the benefits of other stronger serums like dior
it is not irritating.
it doesn't irritate or redden my skin
if you want that dewy glow then you must give this a try
ordinarily i do not wear makeup
i don't use it everyday
just can't tolerate many beauty products
without being greasy at all
my moisturizer isn't quite cutting it
when i used the moisturizer alone, it was nice.
can't attest to whether or not it will brighten my skin
the dispenser only gives you a smidge at a time
i don't even need to use a daily moisturizer anymore
now that it's hot
i used ddf moisturizer which broke me out real bad
my skin is more even and glowy.
it's amazing that it's lasted this long.
i don't know if it actually lightens the skin
making me look tired or squinty
it's a little sticky for that
believe it or not- i am now washing my face only at night with cleanser to get rid of makeup etc
etc i'll use it at night too
so when it's not hot outside i use this alone under makeup
doesn't irritate me or break me out
my only quibble is the scent-- it's a bit on the strong side
and it's safe around the eyes!
since i can't use heavy cream
fortunately my skin is usually clear
sometimes it gets super oily
i get bad breakouts
when you've struggled with dull
the spf is no joke
a lot of brands make me itchy and breakout.
i don't really notice any scent
f you are oily then this won't work for you cause it is a bit greasy
i didn't expect such high performance from this unassuming little jar
does not leave my skin white
the smell is a little perfumey, but not bad.
forgot how much i love their moisturizer
i like the fact that it has spf 30.
not greasy at all
doesn't make my face oily in the process
it's light enough for the summer
it's probably too heavy for really oily skins
does not feel oily at all
might feel a bit like sunscreen when you first put it on
light fragrance that doesn't bother me.
does not feel like it's laying on top of your skin
does not cause me to break out like a lot of other moisturizers with spf do
it isn't greasy at all.
it's really moisturizing without being greasy or leaving that awful film on top of your skin
does not have a heavy
you can barely tell there is spf in this cream because it is not thick
does not leave a residue
does not get oily even at the end of the day.
don't have to worry about getting shiny
does not pill up under makeup
my clinique moisturizer just wasn't cutting it
it made me so greasy
perhaps it is giving my skin the moisture it needs so that is doesn't need to overproduce oil?
yet not too oily or heavy on the skin
never feels heavy or greasy
i do find that my face stings a little if i apply right after scrubbing my face
doesn't make my face feel greasy either
can't always use products with spf
i can't get over how good it smells
absorbs so fast you don't have to wait for it to completely settle on your skin
this product doesn't make me oily at all
not only does it protect my sensitive skin it's so easy to wear under makeup
it didn't clog my pores
love the smell and its not too heavy.
love this product cause it's light weight
doesn't make your make up cake up
it tends to leave my skin more shiny than i would prefer
sometimes it's hard to get out of the jar
it's helped with wrinkles, too.
its like a drink for you face
doesn't clog my pores
usually anything with spf
does not clog pores
just a note: if you've never had a professional facial
it does wonders for skin
i learned that you should never use dial soap on your face
anyway after my facial
i usually dont like buying expensive moisturizes
yes, it made my nose very shiny!
otherwise steer clear or try the lotion version of this
she says it not heavy or greasy
not to mention the eye cream.
i agree that the texture feels like a primer
you can feel a bit of tingling as the salicylic acid does it's stuff
this is the first acne product i have used that has made my acne dissapear
i rarely wear it under makeup
it's like those foundation primers
easy to wear under makeup
it not greasy or sticky at all
i still cringe every time i go to buy a tube
whenever i don't have it i am guaranteed to have a zit appear
it is not greasy at all
i don't even need a moisturizer with this under my makeup
whenever i detect a small bump or feel like there's a pimple developing i just use a dab
the pimple doesn't st
i am no longer afraid of pimples!!
it wasn't too harsh
didn't make my skin burn
it almost felt like i was putting givenchy's mister mat
even if i squeeze out those nasty clogged pores in the t-zone
my skin does burn/itch a little after applying
i usually put it on nightly where i seem to sometimes have clogged pores or blemishes coming up
it's a little pricey though.
i do still get the occasional pimple
it doesn't dry out my skin or make it flaky
it's like a primer and treatment in-one!
this doesn't get rid of bumpy acne asap
i did not have acne even when i went through puberty
you can apply a tiny bit just under your foundation to give a flawless finish with out worring about cloggin pores
i like to wear that when i am not wearing makeup out
it moisturizes a lot yet it is not greasy at all
not greasy feeling at all
i usually use lancome's teint idole fresh wear
not so thick that it feels like a mask
rich moisturizers usually make me break out
it doesn't take much product to cover the face
my skin wasn't greasy that day
my skin isn't even dull so for me to see such an improvement
it's great too and not as heavy.
if you don't have dry skin i wouldn't recommend this product
they don't make my t-zone oily
because sometimes it seems like my skin is impossible to satisfy
it is also more scented than the day cream which i didn't like
it doesn't not make me oily at all
this doesn't seem to aggravate it like other heavy moisturizers can
it is not greasy by any means
it also doesn't have a terrible scent.
i recommend this product to anyone who is sick of spending money on eye creams that don't deliver on their promises
doesn't irritate my eyes
it doesn't have an overwhelming scent either.
it's not too heavy and it does hydrate well.
it's literally a miracle in a bottle
it's the only product that gives my skin the moisture it needs
although i was hesitant to use this with my oily skin
it doesn't have much of a scent
it will be greasy
not even eye makeup
she doesn't seem to age
which i tend to get
i usually do like 5 pumps
it really does melt away my makeup with no irritation at all
this will not deep clean your skin it's just that first step before cleansing
i know it's pricey but it lasts long.
it's just so cleansing
i need stuff that is simple
not too oily, not too sticky.
using water to just rinse it off is a ridiculous idea
but i'll give the balm a try.
people need to get that it isn't for eye makeup!
it's for the face.
it should get all your makeup off
have never had any makeup remover work this good
didn't sting my skin
doesn't have a residue feel like other cleansers i've used
i found that it doesn't remove everything
i am usually taken for 40-ish
i do not like the way it removes eye makeup
i typically use a different product to remove my eye makeup anyway
on the flip side this product doesn't dry out my skin like most makeup removers
sunscreen etc wasn't totally coming off
it's meant to be used to remove your makeup before your skin care routine
the 3 step face wash doesn't really take off makeup
don't use this on your eyes- use the eye makeup remover one
thats why they make separate eye-makeup removers
will definately buy more as it works to take off the makeup without drying my skin
it dissolves makeup like it was never there
it's not very foamy
the consistency feels a little slimy
this stuff burns if it gets anywhere near my eyes or mascara
still have to use other products to get the rest of my eyeliner
it does not leave my skin feeling oily like most of the make up remover wipes that i have tried
takes off my makeup so easliy
i really like this makeup remover
an actual eye makeup remover would work much better to remove mascara
i dont think it brings any acne problems
removes all make-ups easily with very little rubbing
this gentle product works very well when it is used on it's own before washing with a cleanser
so my cleanser can get in there
even my eye makeup
it's gentle enough that my skin does not become irritated when i use my usual daily cleanser afterwards
does not leave a residue
i don't use a makeup primer
i don't like the scent at all
doesn't leave that residue
i love the lightness of it because it doesn't clog my pores
it does not make me sweat
this cream did the trick
do not have one wrinkle or crow's foot
your skin will love it
summer because it's lightweight
not greasy at all
i like the fact that this isn't greasy at all
since it's not heavy at all
i feel that it doesn't interfere with the makeup "canvas"
i usually prefer a cream
the only problem is a bit kind of shine when applying
doesn't feel heavy and the spf is an added bonus!
spf doesn't irritate my skin.
i also loved the fact that you couldn't smell the spf like other moisturizers
one of the things that i dislike about other bottled shiseido moisturizer is that you can't tell how much product is left
it's almost like rubbing milk on your face.
to clarify: this doesn't help get rid of wrinkles
doesn't leave my face greasy
there is no greasy
you hardly notice any fragrance
i don't usually pay this much for cream
doesn't leave a greasy feeling
it is a little milky so the spreadability/coverage with one pump is great
i absolutely loved this moisturizer because i didn't need to mix rose water with it
since i'm only 21 i don't have lines or wrinkles
having to worry that i am oily again
i can't wait to wash my face
found it so hydrating that i often use it alone
it's hard to get the cream out of it
it's thick but doesn't leave your face oily.
it's not thick or heavy
it feels like a blanket on my skin
has a very subtle scent that doesn't feel too overpowering for going to sleep
i tend to break out
in particular those dreaded "11's" some of us get between our brows
oily night creams so this was perfect for what i wanted
this cream does make my skin seem smoother
doesn't make me too greasy or anything
doesn't make my skin oily or make me breakout
my wrinkles haven't gone back to their pre-botox depth i usually expect to see about four months out
not into that horrible spf smell or ridiculous greasiness in facial creams?
i don't like the smell it gives me a headache
i must say that it is quite thick
greasy which is why i only use this eye cream at night
it isn't greasy feeling nor does it cause breakouts
f you don't like scents you may not want to use this cream
if you don't like the way it feels on your skin
healthy skin that i don't have to wipe the oil off of
don't be fooled by the little jar
i don't have a ton of wrinkles yet
i sometimes cheat to try to save money
it still didn't feel greasy at all
doesn't break the bank
it doesn't feel as dry as it did before.
it does not give me a sticky/oily feeling which is great
now, it doesn't get oily at all.
i definitely recommend this product for those who have combination of oily
some products make my t-zone very oily
doesn't leave your skin feeling greasy
it doesn't do a whole lot for wrinkles
it does not make my face oily in the morning nor make my face oily during the day
somehow it made my acne disappear
it leaves the skin feeling nice without feeling heavy like some night creams do
i can't use greasier or heavier moisturizers prior to make-up application
i think my skin would probably wither up
i usually don't like face cream out of a container
the makeup doesn't slide off my face
not at all greasy.
or they feel so oily
greasy i stop using them
it doesnt have a bad smell
i would definantly recomend this cream to anyone who needs a little extra moisture
that is enough product to massage into my face
i hate going to sleep with a greasy feeling on my face
i don't have much oily problem with it in the t-zone
i am always a little wary of moisturizers because my pores clog so easily
looks like it's basically glycerin
it's not too thick or heavy
smooth enough to apply my makeup afterward
there's no spf coverage
it doesn't make me feel all oily after applying
it was sooooooooooo heavy
almost greasy like feeling
it's not heavy or leave a greasy feeling on my face
if you really want to get rid of wrinkles
don't expect it to completely get rid of it
doesn't have a strong smell that lingers like some other night creams/lotions
it sounds like a contradiction to say it's lightweight
it's light enough for day
i like how i could see how much i'm using up with its translucent bottle
don't let the liquid
one star was lost as it's a bit too rich for my combination skin
my face can breathe the lotion is so light that it doesnt feel like your face is suffocating
it is not thick as far as consistency goes so you don't feel like you have a layer of gunk on your face when you sleep
when it comes to skin care
big bucks to find a moisturizer that my skin likes
i love this stuff because it's a miracle fix for my skin
it didn't make my oily t-zone worse either.
it's totally worth the price if you have any dry skin areas
if you do get breakouts usually
it's especially good for nighttime use
i don't know how to get rid of this besides having the fat sucked out under my eyes
it doesn't irritate my eyes
i am so fickle with makeup
can't love this eye cream enough.
i don't know if it's doing anything for my tiny wrinkles
if it gets in your eyes it can really sting
it doesn't create an issue with my makeup
i wouldn't suggest it for those that are very oily
i don't buy eye cream yet because usually the face cream i use is thick enough for my eye area
get the willies about using it for long-term health effects
i just want some real moisturization
while being able to apply a bit of concealer without everything caking up
not sticky at all
while it doesn't fix dark circles
it's great on cuticles too
not from hangovers or lack of sleep either.
the catch is it doesn't absorb very well which is ok for night
do not use it on my lids
this one surely is thick enough to hydrate
doesn't irritate my skin
my eyes don't look flaky and dry anymore.
this may not be ideal for everyone's morning routine
the product comes with a little spatula to help get the product out
this cream tends to be a little on the greasy side
usually only wear it at night or on days where i will be wearing minimal makeup
it does feel a little oily
it magically makes them better
after trying maybe 20 other sephora eye creams
it's more the mascara that can smear
dryness under the eyes that i don't want perpetuated into fine lines
it is good for day as long as you use a teeny tiny bit--otherwise i have a hard time getting any concealer to stay put on top of it
its a bit greasy but nothing you can't handle
i tried so many eye cream
however i do find that it's great for "plumping" the eye area
if you don't have dry under eye i don't think you'll like this one
i agree with other reviewers that it is perhaps too heavy for daytime use under makeup
as i do not have the crepe paper skin when i use it
it doesn't mess up my under eye concealer
if you use anymore than a little bit it will appear greasy because the cream is so rich
i think it is a bit greasy for putting under eye' makeup
can ruin your mascara during a hot day so you might need to touch up your undereye more often
even the morning after you can still feel your skin plump
it really makes a difference on your crows feet you'll be saying
i find that this is only eye creme that helps.
even though it's a thick cream
i didn't find that it was heavy or sticky for night time use
this product is not thick at all.
i see some people are complaining because it doesn't absorb quickly
you wouldn't want to make them a staple in your regimen
i don't necessarily have dryness or oiliness under my eyes
i don't think it looks oily or anything
i don't yet have wrinkles
can't attest to it's wrinkle-fighting capabilities
it is super oily/greasy as many other reviews say however i need that in/around my eyes
firmness around my eye plus the reduction in fine lines is worth the greasy-ness
can't say it's reversed any signs of aging
i often get little red bumps around my eyes when i use a make up remover
so far these are one of two facial wipes that doesn't burn the heck out of my face
doesn't irritate it at all
no more little red bumps or oily mess when i wake up
it is plenty to remove my makeup
even the bare wipes by josie maran would irritate sometimes
forget to take off your makeup or just clean your face if you didn't wear makeup that day
this wipes most of my makeup off since i don't wear eye makeup so they work
they do not leave a sticky or oily residue nor did it cause any breakouts
the only con is it's pricey for only 30 sheets.
did not remove makeup or oil
would make my skin oilier or cause me to break out
don't leave a film on my skin
it doesn't leave much of a residue like the other face wipes
cleanser did not sting my eyes
these take most of my makeup off without any trouble when i'm feeling too lazy to use eye makeup remover :
they don't leave odd residues
they are the only face wipes that don't break out my very acne prone skin
these sheets smell good
it is the only face wash i found that truly cleansed my skin without irritation
because of that they do not irritate my skin or cause breakouts
using the shiseido sheets was a little bit of luxury in an otherwise un-glamorous time
these cleansing sheets are a great alternative if there just isn't enough time to wash all your makeup off before bed
the sheets take off my makeups really well without irriating my skin
they're great for removing light make up
too tired to wash your face
it comes in a hard plastic container which i like better than the soft wrappers wipes usually come in since it's easier to seal
it's a staple in my supply.
avoiding my eyes if i don't want to disturb my eye makeup look
dont even have to use waterproof remover
doesn't remove waterproof eye makeup completely
bottom eyeliner not so much
if you use them only when you're too tired to take your makeup off
i sometimes use it alone before i go to bed if i'm super tired
i don't wear make-up often
i don't bother washing it
these are the only makeup wipes that i use.
these wipes not only remove my makeup
my only complaint is that they don't remove all of my mascara
i've tried all sorts of makeup removers
they're no better than my regular cleansing sheets
i recomend it for those that sometimes skip a full face wash before bed
perfect if you're too lazy to remove your makeup
they don't burn my eyes
i don't know if it is effective against water-proof mascara
they don't leave a residue on your skin.
only thing that is a bit annoying is that the sheets tend to stick together when you try to take them out of the package
it's a great way to cleanse your skin while you're on the go
i would rather remove makeup
some nights i just cant bare to go through my whole cleansing system
i love using these sheets when i'm on the go or don't have time to wash my face
sometimes i use them when i'm feeling too lazy to wash my face at night as well
i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 bc it doesn't totally remove eye make-up
at first i was nervous about it bc the sheets don't feel completely saturated
i don't wear alot of face make-up
these don't get every single bit of makeup off
these lightly fragranced sheets do exactly what is claimed
doesn't sting my sensitive skin at all
i feel guilty buying them as they're a little expensive
helps you take off your makeup before you use the cleanser
i gave it 4 stars because it does not fully remove my mascara
it does remove all my other makeup
the last thing i want to do is spend a lot of time removing eyeshadow
gentle enough to use even around the eyes
or a quick cleanup before bed when you don't want to fuss with a traditional rinse-off cleanser
doesn't leave a soapy feeling at the end
it's a little big for my purse
still be light enough to not aggravate my oily areas
my t zone barely gets oily at all now
doesn't break my skin out.
i prefer something light for daytime wear under makeup
it also doesn't leave that greasy feeling some face creams do
does not give my face an oily feel
it definitely leaves my skin less oily than anything else
don't feel it sitting on my skin all day like some moisturizers tend to do
ful of products that doesn't cause more acne on my sensitive skin
which happens when i don't use any moisturizer at all
not greasy at all
doesn't make my skin feel oily after put it on everyday
under makeup i'd say this doesn't need to pair with a mattifying primer
if you're feeling especially oily
my only bone to pick is that the cap is a bit wonky
in the summer it tends to get more oily.
you will see that your skin is mattified
if you wear makeup everyday you'll definitely run out of this product in no time
if you're oily/combo this will be amazing for you
it doesn't make my face feel tight like other mattifying moisturizer
the gel like moisturizer does a great job to make my face feel soft yet doesn't feel heavy
this helps keep my face have a matte look all day long
it doesn't clog my pores a all
which i didn't think was possible because i've tried nearly everything that targets oiliness
i think what some don't like in this moisturizer is that once this product dries down
it hardly feels like you have anything on your face because we're all used to that greasy/oily feeling after using a moisturizer
the fact that this moisturizer doesn't have any
always had trouble finding a moisturizer that didn't make me any more oily
i do agree the glass bottle is a bit too heavy
i would only recommend this product for people with oily skin
made my skin feel dry -- this product doesn't do that
maybe because i have super oily skin
i think those w/ slightly oily skin would like this
this moisturizer works great for my oily skin because it doesn't leave residue or shine
have oily skin that tends to break out more as an adult than it ever did during my adolescent years
honestly i underestimated this moisturizer thinking that by morning i'm probably gonna wake up with another humongous zit on my forehead
it doesn't leave a film
a residue or any other evidence on your skin except a very nice
it doesn't clog my pores
definitely doesn't feel like it is clogging your pores or anything
not greasy at all
like clean laundry or something
doesn't make my face any oily-er like other moisturizers tend to
this is really good if you want to use other products on top like spf/bb cream/tinted moisturizer etc because it doesn't feel heavy whatsoever
i don't know if this is a strong enough mattifying for my skin
i didn't feel shiny or slimy after using it
it's very light and half-gel.
i just do a quick wipe with a washcloth
my oily skin is as balanced as it's going to get
my only gripe is that its a little runny so you have you be quick or it'll slide right off your finger
doesn't clog my pores
my face is unfortunately still oily
having a hg moisturizer that doesn't make me any oilier is key
i only have 1 other moisturizer that doesn't make me oily/break out/feel greasy
he's not oily-type
it does not make you oily at all
it doesn't leave my skin sticky or shiny.
not greasy and settles in your skin well.
doesn't make my skin feel oiler
too bad it's out of stock right now
it doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy
this moisturizer is really easy to apply
since it's getting cold here
faint if you don't like fragrances this would be a good pick
i am not sure if it truely keeps your face matte because i use oil absorbing wipes
it's a tad bit dryer/mattier than i like
it does not contain any anti-aging properties nor anything else that one typically looks for in a moisturizer
it did eliminate some of the acne on my face
have weird skin that tends to be crazy oily
super dry because i can't put any moisturizer on it because i look like an oil field if i do
they always make my skin crazy oily
doesn't make me feel greasy
it does not stay on the surface of your skin with is a big plus for me
i hate the way other moisturizers make my skin shiny
it actually does make your skin look matte
that's just me because my skin naturally gets really oily after just a couple hours
have difficulty in finding a moisturizer that doesn't make my makeup slide off of my face or make me feel/look like an oil slick
it's so easy to absorb
isn't greasy or heavy at all
it's become a product that i almost always have a backup of
like when you rub alcohol
it's the only moisturizer where i don't get greasy or little red bumps
i've searched for a moisturizer that doesn't cause break-outs
thereby avoiding that weird "squeaky clean" feeling many gels
it doesn't feel heavy at all.
it's non-greasy and it's so lightweight.
usually don't have any problems until i come to the moisturizer
it doesn't really help with wrinkles
it is the only moisturizer that doesn't break me out or make me oily
doesn't feel greasy or oily
even in the texas heat, this is not too heavy.
i don't wake with breakouts or an oil slick in my t zone
doesn't have a strong smell like some moisturizers
i really like this product because i have oily skin
it doesn't overpower or weigh down on your face
only bad thing is it does make skin a little more oily after use
it also doesn't make me break out like some other lotions have in the past
i don't feel dry right after applying it or like i have a ton of greasy stuff on my face
my skin doesn't feel quite as smooth as it did using the lucent product
it's helped maintain my color
my sensitive skin didn't break out at all
because this is a gel base it doesn't add greasiness to my face
the smell is so minimal you don't even notice it
it doesn't feel greasy at all.
you don't need to apply a lot of it on your face.
this is the only moisturizer i have used that does not cause acne
it doesn't cause any pimples
it doesn't make my face shiny after a few hours
it's not quite intensive enough to keep my skin from flaking in some areas
it moisturizes quickly even though it seems like it disappears on your skin
the texture can't be beat
i dont like to feel such a heavy cream when i put on my skin
it is fab and does the job with no residue.
it never feels greasy or causes any irritation
all you need is a dab
it gives me just the right amount of moisture i need without making me greasy
it is great if you have oily or combination skin.
it works like a charm without causing me to be too oily or causing breakouts
it's not greasy at all.
my skin lets me know when i'm using the wrong moisturizer
whether it's through breakouts or flaky skin
it's doesn't leave me parched either
does not leave a greasy film at all
it never feels greasy or heavy on the skin
there's just a hint left on the surface of the skin
give it a try if you've been searching for something very moisturizing that won't feel like a greasy mask on your skin
prone to occasional acne i did not want anything too heavy
some people may not like the sticky feeling
can't live without it especially in winter.
i read that the lack of moisture in my skin should actually be causing breakouts
it's not too heavy
i wouldn't say the smell of the cream is too strong or unpleasant in anyway
if you are on the oilier end
it feels like i'm spoiling myself at the spa when i use it
i got it as a sample… still can't afford a full size…i only use it after i popped a pimple
it literally melts upon application without any heavy feel
it never made my skin too oily
i reluctantly tried to this moisturizer thinking it may be too heavy
it does not leave my skin grease
isn't it basically just a silicone mask?
this is the only one that actually hydrates my skin at night
it's like they sit on the skin and don't absorb.
now that it's winter
my skin is starting to simply peel off
it's not too thick to where you feel like your face is suffocating
you can't beat the hydration.
they never seem to measure up to the shiseido creams
shiseido makes it so that the glass container pops out
i don't need it for any anti-aging yet as i've stayed out of the sun my whole life
this stuff is like the holy grail of all face creams
it does not leave your face feeling greasy at all
it is not greasy
my face didn't look oily during the day.
does not feel sticky on the face
does not cause acne
it doesn't make my skin oily or mess up my makeup
it's probably more of a night cream
i don't have to use much to moisturize my whole face
this product does plump up your face
t gives you a more youthful look
have never found a skin toner that didn't break me out
i can't speak to anti-aging effects as i'm still quite young
cannot recommend it enough to all skin types.
the stuff lasts forever
would probably make my oily skin break out
not greasy or heavy
it would be easy to overdo it
not at all greasy
it's absorbed quickly so there's no greasy look at bedtime
it hydrates yet isn't greasy.
it doesn't feel greasy or heavy at all.
i believe it'll be a bit too oily for summer
i usually have a reaction to face creams especially if they have a scent or any type of "anti-aging" solution
i don't always use this as a face cream especially in the day time as it gives my combination skin an oily appearance
as my skin has a tendency to break out
it really helps get rid of flakey skin
while i didn't really have use for them in the summer with my super-oily skin
the only dowonside is it even though it's lightweight
because with regular use my skin is never dry anymore
i do not use this in the morning at the moisturizer before my makeup because my face tends to get really oily
it doesn't make your skin break out
it doesn't make my sensitive eyes run
so you can use it around your eyes too
when i have a tan i wear it alone even to the office
does not feel or look heavy on the face
it is not greasy and sits well on the skin.
does not make my skin massively oily
i call it a "softener" because it really does soften my skin
i only use at night because it's so expensive.
it does lighten them to the point they don't show thru my tinted moisturizer
it is concentrated, so you don't need gobs of it!
i just dip my finger tip in and that's enough.
something my dully flaky skin had long forgotten
i think i'll just stick to the fake tan now
my skin looks even
it didn't really do anything in terms of "whitening" for me
maybe this product works to "whiten" if you give it a long time to work
it makes my skin feel literally squeaky clean.
i never use any make up remover
so this is that kind of cleanser that gives you that stripped squeaky clean feeling
it's definitely not for dry skin because it strips your skin
i only had two zits pop up whereas normally i have about 10
it takes off all of my makeup when i'm too lazy to use makeup remover beforeh
can't express enough the brightening effect.
it doesn't irritate my skin
so you don't need to use special make up remover to clean daily foundation
which i don't think is a good thing because it does feel squeaky clean
i believe that means it's removing all oils including good ones
it does not clean off eye makeup
i do not use waterproof stuff
my t-zone gets pretty oily towards the end of the day
it cleans makeup really easily
it really removes all your makeup.
this is probably the only foaming cleanser i've ever tried that truly defines what a foaming cleanser should be
you only need a dime size drop of it to get a nice foamy lather
the sample lasted me a while because it foams quite easily
this cleaner is just for normal wash it can't be used for removing make up
you don't feel any oil on your face
not greasy at all.
i don't have as many acne breakouts as before.
don't expect a cleanser to clean your skin if it cannot reach your skin- lol
if it makes your skin too dry or feel " not clean" then maybe your skin type has other needs
you'll see it slowly
which i personally prefer since i think if your skin turns bright so fast that means it contains "bleach?"
however it does lather a little bit
it gives you a squeaky clean feeling right after you rinse off
sometimes i use the clarisonic with it
this not only cleans
then reality hit- it's expensive for a cleanser that i would use 2 times a day
this isn't a "splurge" when you look
i like how when you rub it into your face it gets so bubbly
it seems difficult to find a decent cleanser that will not only unclog your pores
it's also a very gentle formula that won't irritate or dry out your skin
does not leave the face oily.
f your looking to use it as an exfoliator use a brush with it instead of just your h
about half a dime is good to get your skin clean
it's not a make up remover per se
will already start to bubble once you've massaged it on your face
it doesn't make my face feel tight
foams like you couldnt even imagine
i can't start my day without this cleanser!
it's foamy so you only need a little for your whole face
this doesn't irritate my skin
bliss doesn't foam as much
doesn't remove make up as effectively as you do
it gives you a lot of foam
it does not feel drying out your skin.
i can tell because when i use a toner after there isn't anything left on my skin
i can honestly say say that m skin if often diametrically opposed re: pale skin/tan skin
i really would also like to mention that wl foaming face wash is the most amazing cleanser i've ever used
you can feel how soft it's making your skin as you wash
you don't need much for a rich lather
is not as good as removing mascara
i feel like if i get a zit
i mean squeaky clean
it's a very light moisturizer so you might want to put something over it if your skin is dry
i do not like mosturizing cleansers that leave a flim on my skin even after several attepmts to rinse it off
cannot really judge if it brightens
i love how i only need to use a little bit to work up a big lather
but i feel super squeaky clean after using it!
wow does this stuff foam so you only need a small amount
didn't over or under hydrate
it's as if you haven't worn makeup for days
it doesn't sting unless the makeup itself gets into the eyes it's so creamy
easily it gets rid of eye makeup
i don't use this to remove eye makeup
it doesn't feel heavy
doesn't leave that white cast that some spf products do
this is the only spf that i've found that doesn't add to the oily feeling
it doesn't feel greasy at all
it's not greasy or heavy
i do think it brightens your skin if used religiously
yet still gives my skin the moisture it needs
it does brighten my face a bit
i would not likely recommend it to anyone with really oily skin
cast of my skin if i don't use it
it's everything i wanted in an everyday moisturizer
it had me so paranoid
yet it doesn't lighten my skin as much as the other products from the "white lucent" line so visibly does
otherwise my skin feels really dry as if i skipped putting any moisturizers at all
i can't tell a difference in making my skin brighter though
provided enough moisture for my az-stressed skin without making me look shiny
this product reallly helps her including with the foam cleansing too
really hides my age spots
by the end of the day my face doesn't feel dull or tired because it helps me maintain a fresh
it doesn't have a typical spf scent either
not sure if this is the cream for oily skin however
even with makeup on
it's just so hydrating but not greasy and heavy.
does not leave my skin feeling greasy
that even with a primer
not only does it whiten your skin
the cream is not causing breakout or anything bad like other cream moisturizers
so good if you tend to be oily or break out think twice
it seems to brigthen my skin
it makes my skin a teeny bit greasy
a very tiny dab will do just fine
suffering from too many times in the sun i find i can not do without the radiance this provides
it's a bit sticky once on your skin
it doesn't make your skin oily
i can tell it's lightening my skin
those who are expecting quick results from anything applied topically do not know much about cell biology
this cream makes your skin really juicy!
rather this lingering fragrance that you cant get enough of
sometimes if i wake up looking tired all i have to do is wash
i know that if i don't moisturize properly my skin will age prematurely
can't were under makeup
i did however notice it made me break out a bit/enlarge my pores so though its a great moisturizer i would only buy it if your skin is on the dry side
although your face looks really shiny
i don't mind since it's a night cream
when this product used alone it doesn't really take away dark spots it needs to be used with the serum or it will take wayyyy long to work
f you have more sensitive skin or fragrance would bother you
it's not a miracle cure for dark circles
don't see any new lines or my dark circles aren't getting darker
not that drugstore products don't work
i may change creams in the future to something with a little more ant-aging oomph
i've tried so many duds
all of the origin stuff stinks
glamglow for the eyes stinks
the boscia eye balm doesn't work
if you are looking to hide the awful bags under your eyes without the use of makeup then this is the product for you
this stuff works great under makeup because it doesn't have a greasy texture
concealer only really catches right after application
doesn't have a greasy texture afterwards so for me thats a huge plus cause i hate the greasy feel of some of these products
while this does nothing for my dark circles
start preventing wrinkles anyway
well i don't think it brightens the under eye enough
it looks like barely any product in the jar
it dries quickly so that you can put your makeup on pretty quickly
i don't know if this really brightens or de puffs
the fact that it doesn't have a scent
you get a lot of product in the pot
then dab an extra layer into the skin under my eyes just to make sure it's saturated
but it doesn't help with my dark circles at all!
i don't think it's meant for dark circles
i do not see any difference or lightness under my eyes
sometimes my eyes look a little puffy
the "aging + wrinkles" part aren't what i am concerned with
it doesn't melt into the corners of my eyes over time like some others do
this one didn't cause an allergic reaction or itching
it's not a cream that will give you instant results
doesn't really brighten the area or help with the darkness
if you don't need help with combating dark circles
it doesn't seem to help my dark circles much
i don't believe it really offers any brightening or reduction of dark circles
if i didn't get an allergic reaction
it's non-greasy, smooth and does what it says!
i don't have reaaal wrinkles yet
usually my eyes burn or i break out.
it doesn't irritate or make my eyes water.
i do not have super dark circles or puffiness
it doesn't work miracles on dark circles
that doesn't seem to be a common problem
it's so refreshing to wake up or wash off my makeup
it doesn't cause flare ups
there is really nothing unpleasant or bad about this eye cream
i don't usually use eye cream because i have in the past
i found occitanes magic eye serum to be too liquidy while the blue line always breaks me out bc too riche
i know my dark circles aren't heritagity i was really skeptical about about eye cremes
flakey this isn't helping
i probably need another kind of moisturizer that clinique might provide
if you use this as a day eye cream
you really want to let it soak in for atleast 25-30 minutes before you apply makeup other wise the creams moisture can slide to where ever you wipe your face
i didn't feel the need for a bunch of expensive anti-aging ingredients
i've often said that "an eye cream is just an eye cream"
with less defined wrinkles you would get from smiling a lot
it never stings or irritates
puffiness isn't really an issue i have
they aren't as dark as before
turns out it's mainly genetics
it's almost like a balm more than a cream
it's not too heavy
also does not make your eye makeup smear or slide
it's really reduced both problems
the wrong cleanser can turn my face into a flaky
the only thing i don't like about this is the texture
sometimes it may take a few washes to remove heavy waterproof makeup
it doesn't foam up a lot which proves there aren't those harsh chemicals added which i like
oily skin prone to the very occasional breakout if i use the wrong product
i don't have to hid the ugly breakouts on my forehead anymore
this face wash doesn't foam when using
i can still tell it's getting my face clean
it doesn't dry my face out like the drugstore kind
why i gave 4 starts to this products because it's doesn't foam i'd say even the opposite you apply it on the dry skin massage a little
the product doesn't take up all that space
because it's a really liquid gel
have tried countless products trying to find something that is both gentle enough that wont cause redness
try if, you'll love it.
t doesn't keep my skin oil-free all day
doesn't leave me feeling tight
it doesn't leave my skin with a 'filmy' feel
doesn't seem to strip it of it's moisture
it doesn't foam at all etc
my skin doesn't feel tight
it foams slightly and does not overdry the skin.
i don't use this to remove makeup
it's gentle yet does it's job at cleansing
can feel greasy at some areas
it's foamy, but not overly so.
didn't want to use any product with glycol
my only complaint is that it's consistency is like a watery jelly
it's not a really foam-producing product
nothing else makes my skin glow the way this does
it's really hard to find a cleanser that won't irritate my sensitive skin
it's not a foamy cleanser
the consistancy feels like spit
whatever your skin type
i like this wash.
does not foam practically at all
it is so gentle that my face doesn't feel dry
i often forget to put my moisturizer on
skin doesn't feel tight after washing
know it's not stripping the skin
does not remove all eye makeup though.
this doesn't really foam up
one pump is all you need to create a lather for your entire face
this thankfully didn't irritate my skin
it's on the pricey side
this cleanser is definitely not going to foam or make you feel like your skin is super duper clean after using it
yet it does seem to dissolve the face makeup
it's starting to make me clear up a little
my only complaint is that it makes my skin so clean i can see all my imperfections
that don't cause reactions
the cleanser doesn't actually rest on the tube
as it doesn't lather much
i don't need to wash again or apply moisturizer since it leaves skin balanced
the only thing i don't like is the fact it does not foam up very much while washing your face
this cleanser doesn't disappoint
best part is it is ph balanced so you do not need a toner
doesn't have all the harsh chemicals
it doesn't have all those darn parabens
i usually can't stick with the same product
it doesn't foam up which is what most do
my skin was going through a phase i would get frequent blackhead breakouts in my t-zone area
it's a godsend, no breakouts anymore.
less pimples i have gotten
you really need to use a separate eye makeup remover
it's nice to have some that are not loaded with toxins
i hope this isn't starting to sound like one of those late night infomercials
ren does exactly what it says it will by eliminating the oil on my oily
it isn't really foamy
this doesn't leather as much as i would like
i usually don't like 'gel' cleanser
this is the only one i've used that makes my skin feel truly clean without stripping it of much needed moisture
need to use gentle products that won't irritate it
use caudalie cleansing oil in the evening as this cleanser doesn't exactly remove make-up
i don't have as much dryness or small bumps from washing my face anymore
does not remove makeup!
one thing that made me take one star off is that it doesn't remove makeup
since that's not the purpose of this cleanser
i like that it's all natural
the extra step usually doesn't bother me
it doesn't foam like regular cleansers which i didn't like as much
i love that it's not perfumey
or filled with bad ingredients
i find it does remove makeup
i can only assume that the refreshing feeling goes away because my skin is no longer quenched of thirst nor is it dirty anymore
which i love because i don`t want to use night creams
at night your skin suppose to breath
will not get foamy
get why people say their face doesn't feel "clean" enough after washing with the cleansing milk
it doesn't leave my face feeling tight at all like so many other cleansers
doesn't really lather or foam up
it does not remove eye makeup so be sure to use an eye makeup remover before using this product
this winter i tried everything for my flaky skin
this product does not foam
it simply disappears into your h
it doesn't clean makeup off well
it's the consistency of a body butter.
doesn't irritate my skin or eyes
is not stripping or irritating in any way
t does not foam or lather
so there's no makeup on my face
rinse well, or you will feel a film on your face.
it is just too gentle that cannot even remove oil from t-zone
can't do typical night creams
for me personally it just seems like a cleanser i'd use in the evening before applying night cream rather than something i'd use in the shower in the morning to feel clean
good cleanser that doesn't burn my sensitive eyes
doesn't leave my skin feeling tight
this is one of the few cleansers that hits the perfect balance for my skin of not stripping it
therefore it doesn't strip away oils
there's few cleansers that said good for sensitive skin
does not remove a makeup
i would say that i get fewer whiteheads when i combine with a foaming cleanser once every few washes
it's actually a "healthy" product
ered into the sephora store just hoping to get some ideas about super-gentle cleansers
just because it's gentle
i don't wear makeup
i can never get it to rinse clean
some people might say it's almost oily
it has like a light cooling sensation like there's mint or something like that in it
it's even helped the eczema on my face!!
not tight like many cleansers do
it's probably the gentlest i've found so far.
it's not harsh at all
it does not foam at all
it takes off even water-proof mascara like a dream
it's not greasy like some br
it's hydrating and doesn't sting (on me).
it doesn't dry up quickly that's why i don't give it 5 stars
also, it's kind of pricy.
it doesn't sting or burn my eyes
a plus is that this little tube lasts forever
it doesn't cause my concealor to crease like other creams
is lacking in a lot of chemical crud that i like to avoid
i also love the fact that it's not greasy like a lot of eye products
i also love that it's all natural!
i don't have dark circles
a lot of eye products tend to irritate my eyes
seems like a waste because i always have to wipe off the excess
somehow this gel got rid of my eyelid eczema which was really bad
the only thing it lacks is a hint of extra moisture
it's a pick-me-up product
it didn't completely take the puffiness away
i doubt it because those pesky circles are usually st
there's no good way to control that
i love that its not greasy
the only thing that's gonna get rid of those bags is surgery or maybe more sleep
it's not too heavy yet it's very rich
it doesn't burn a bit
i don't feel like i have to wash it off in the morning
not greasy not heavy, just right!
it's not heavy and absorbs easily.
i don't like the way most night creams feel.
you would like this cream
but it goes on like buttah
i never wake up with greasy skin or get blemishes like i do with other dry skin night lotions
plus it's free from all those nasty ingriedients.
i feel like moisturizer is a long term investment so no matter you use at least your keeping your skin moisturized consistently
it nice and rich but doesn't feel oily.
this night cream is not irritating at all
the lightweight texture does not do much alone
it's hard to find something that can hydrate my skin without breaking out
this cream doesn't seem to cut it
does not leave face feeling slimy
doesn't cause any sensitivities
doesn't leave my face feeling like an oil slick by morning
i fear that this product will prove too rich for my combo skin in the long run
not so rich i break out
i can trust to keep my flaky patches under control
the smell is something you get used to
it is not greasy or heavy.
only thing that keeps my age 40+ acne in check
the only thing i don't like is the packaging.
it never lays on top of my skin or makes it feel oily in any way
if i could i'd purchase a whole 5 gallon drum of the stuff
is not one bit greasy
doesn't break you out or leave you feeling like an oil-slick
added bonus that it's all natural products so even if you have sensitive skin this will not sting or bother you at all
the frankincense cream has a strong smell that is just not for me when used alone
touch my face it still doesn't feel fully absorbed
provided they don't mind the smell
does not leave your face oily looking
does not break me out like other thick night creams i've used have
i can't get over the scent
there are plenty of other good night creams that i don't mind the scent of
i really like this product because it's simple
doesn't have the harsh chemicals
i don't worry about extra perfumes
plus it's one of the more natural lines out there
for those of you that may not be fond of the scent--it usually fades in a few minutes
i've looked for ages for a night cream that isn't too heavy
i want to make sure i don't wake up feeling gunky
it's usually more on the oily side
'm always very hesitant to use night creams or gels because of how oily i will be in the morning
not too oily and it absorbs easily.
as it's a night cream i really don't mind it
not heavy or greasy feeling
i do not use it lightly
my face doesn't look all red
the scent is light and doesn't linger.
i don't use this everyday
still can't get it to scrub off as recommended
this doesn't irritate my skin at all
i ended up loving this invisible pores mask coz that one leave my skin a tingling feel which i don't like
you rub it off
amount because it will be easier to rub off the product with your fingers
it's like a magic trick
you can hardly see my pores!
it can do wonders for those blackheads on my nose
it's not a peel off mask, but a rub off mask.
i wouldn't say it makes my pores invisible
usually i have an issue with bumps in my t-zone area
sometimes i get restless
it makes sense to do that so the aha/bha can slough off dead skin
generally don't love the feeling of my skin afterward
i can't wait to see how the cumulative use helps to take out my blackheads
i never had zits or any skin problems as a teenager
my nose pores always seem smaller after i use it.
it's not at all stripping like some clay masks
it's amazing to see all the oil that this clay mask pulls out when it dries
it also doesn't worsen it either
i must note that using the mask does feel soothing
it can get a little itchy feeling on the skin
doesn't feel smooth like other masks
i can't give the mask 100% of the credit
so maybe it is best for someone who feels their skin is oily or has large pores/blackheads
it's causing some acne
my skin is so even that i don't need makeup.
which is what i ususally get out of clay masks
the directions say to let it dry until it you can rub it off with your fingertips
i love that i don't have to mix it with water like a lot of other clay masks
i do rub it off
it makes me want to wash my face!
don't try to rub it off after it is done drying
i am not a fan of clay masks as the ones i used made my skin itch
it didn't seem to completely pull out blackheads in one try
it does not function as a "peel."
never found anything else that helps with my acne like this cleanser
normally cleansers will work for a bit
i still get the occasional hormonal breakout
i would usually have around 20 zits
i don't mean two pimples
i can never seem to get rid of them for long even when i attack them with acne cleansers
i'll have to just suck it up since it does wonders for my skin
it's now an avid part of my skin routine.
packaging doesn't bother me except the applicator is very tedious
takes like 6-7 pumps to get enough product out
pump combo i feel like a lot of the product just gets tossed when it gets low
it dries out your acne so quick!!!!
this is my go to product for my blemishes
i never get blemishes
it's a heavy glass bottle that's is definitely not travel friendly
i don't like the pump either as it seems to get clogged easily
this cleanser has basically made my acne disappear
while i still get zits
my skin is almost perfect with just the occasional bump or two
it's weird getting used to using it since you put it on dry like lotion then wash it off
i didn't have any issues with it over drying my skin
every time i wash my face with this stuff
i can easily cover my acne up with makeup now
you can reallly feel that glycolic acid putting in work
i feel like i've tried every single acne product both cheap
if you are wearing makeup you have to wash your face first with something simple
it's made an impact on my skin
as the drugstore stuff
it does not irritate my skin
it's way too harsh
the smell you just have to get used to
nothing else topical has worked for me
otherwise it won't sink in
i get bad hormonal breakouts so when i do i use this product i don't use it daily because i don't breakout in acne a lot i just get zits on my chin
when i do get those zits
i wouldn't say it's very good at removing makeup
as it does not foam up or leave my skin feeling tight or "squeaky clean"
this actually got rid of acne without being harsh or overdrying
only acne cleanser that actually doesn't dry out my skin
i would recommend this product to anyone suffering from really stubborn acne
t doesn't remove make up at all
i can't comment on how well this removes makeup as i always remove first
left me without the big crusty spots that most other treatments typically do
it does tingle a little
hormonal breakouts that literally nothing i've tried really seems to help
sweat everyday doesn't help
if a do get a pimple every now
i feel the cleanser really shrinks the pimple.
i still have bad acne
takes a bit longer to rinse off than other cleansers i have used
it doesn't sting or burn my skin
i could not get rid of my stubborn acne
this specifies that it's for oily skin
it doesn't really dry me out
i still get occasional pimples here
it didn't irritate my skin at all
it doesn't leave my face feeling clean
somehow does clear up my mild acne
warning: it does burn a little if the pimples are open
it's not too intense
it wasn't irritated or red.
if you've used any other medicated acne washes- that'll be nothing new
now, it's the occasional zit.
my skin had become ridiculously oily all of a sudden
still got occasional breakouts
what sold me was of course the salesperson he insisted i would never use another face wash astringent again since it's all built in
i can go outside without makeup on not worrying about my shiny acne prone skin
it's doing it's purpose
it's doing it's purpose
it's almost weird how clean it makes my face
i dont break out frequently
when i do get a pimple i pop this right on it
it's not a huge bottle
it zaps blemishes faster than you'd believe.
i do get flakes occasionally
people complaining about the price tag on this product obviously haven't dealt with hormonal acne
it even out my skin texture
yeah it burns for maybe 3 seconds
so for me it's in the chin area
if a breakout occurs all i need is a dab of this
recommend this to anyone with even the basic acne to try this it's a miracle worker
an hourglass primer started to break me out so bad
i usually don't ever have breakouts
that sounds so disgusting
in the morning if you pick at your acne right before you apply your makeup
this serum will help dry it out so you can apply makeup on top of it if you need to cover it
everytime i felt i like i was gonna get a zit it didn't appear in the surface
it doesn't irritate my skin
okay, so i suffer from stress acne.
not as instructed two times per day--it has not dried my skin out either which is very surprising seeing as it is 2% salicylic acid
i don't have acne all over my face
often have at least one pimple coming or going
the length it stays annoyingly on my face
it's not that the salicylic acid is more concentrated
smooth enough to go under makeup6
it stings a bit if you have open acne.
nothing works to control my hormonal acne that has been horribly out of control for a year since having my baby
so breakouts don't get to form
it's the only acne treatment that does not dry out my skin or irritate
price means nothing when it comes down to your skin
there wasn't anything effective for my stubborn face issue
even then it was too harsh such as retin-a or accutane
sounds kinda kooky but it's true.
only downside is that it peels sometimes
it doesn't overly dry out my face
i like how my skin tingles when i apply this.
from things from the dermatologist to everything else
i am almost 50 & have occasional adult acne.
those annoying little bumps everywhere on my jawline
it is gentle enough to not cause irritation
i wasn't a huge fan of the acne face wash from dermadoctor
i love this for my occasional breakouts.
it doesn't dry me out & it really works!
i started out using the ain't misbehavin face wash
however i do still occasionally get a r
but this stuff usually takes care of it quickly.
after trying everything there is out there for hormonal acne this is the only thing that has helped
you can't see when you are running low on the product
doesn't smell or feel mediciney
it is super stinky while it's drying
it doesn't dry me out too much
non toxic stuff too
doesn't irritate nor dry my sensitive skin
it doesn't try your skin
not only is my acne basically gone except for a few mild flair ups occasionally
didnt work as well for me since i dont have blackheads
i still get some breakouts
it doesn't layer well under makeup
is okay to put out this dull skin
maybe tights too much your skin
you'll see a dramatic change in your skin if you have problematic areas like me
it really has helped make my skin softer i just hope it doesn't affect my large pores
hard to find a good daily exfoliator that doesn't dry your skin or make it feel oily
everyone's skin is different
so finding exfoliants that didn't flare up my skin is extremely bothersome
one the days that i don't use this face wash
on days i really want to exfoliate i use this
a moisturizer that it doesn't try me out at all
oh & it doesn't burn your eyes!!!
i always do a "pre-wash" to take off makeup
that's usually a sign that i need to exfoliate
it doesn't do anything for the deeper blackheads
it's good to use right before applying makeup
it does a great job exfoliating without irritating or drying too much
eye cream after anyway
it's actually gentle enough to use in the morning along with a cream cleanser
gentle enough where my face doesn't feel raw
it's not like a regular scrub
even when she's not wearing makeup her skin looks flawless
holy grail item that will forever be a part of my skin care routine
i felt so ugly
it's gentle enough that i can us multiple times a week while also leaving my skin with a bright
smell that you barely notice
i don't use it everyday
i honestly think it was trapping bacteria
haven't had one zit or breakout
it removes makeup too all in one go
it's probably too abrasive for a sonic brush
it doesn't make them disappear
t doesn't irritate sensitive skin
yet it still scrubs amazing
makes your face feel literally squeaky clean
once you rinse it off it doesn't leave a trace of the smell on your face
it just smells like they haven't added a bunch of scents to it
there aren't bad chemicals in it either
it's no miracle product for breakouts
my skin does not get super dry or anything
i might get one to get out major blackheads if i have them
the smell doesn't last long after you've rubbed the beads in
with the idea that perhaps i just needed to exfoliate more to clear my pores
creamy ones don't feel like its doing enough
there's no messy aspect to the texture
like stray beads that get everywhere
my face didn't felt greasy
it's gentle enough to use everyday yet tough enough to get into your pores
this actually cleans my face
if you find yourself struggling with winter skin
the only thing that angers me about the microdelivery exfoliating wash is that it didn't jump out at me in sephora
it just makes it inconvenient
it doesn't irritate my skin at all
dont irritate my skin
it sort of foams up just a bit
somewhat dry once you've patted your face
if you don't mind the smell
it doesn't irritate my skin
i don't really notice a scent at all
didn't use it until recently when i had some skin issues: clogged pores
it's gentle enough for me to use daily
it's gentle enough for daily use while not being too rough or irritating
it helps get rid of any dry skin i may have before putting on my makeup
it's a gengle enough exfoliator that i can use it daily
it's so gentle that i can use it every day
it almost feels like a tickle.
it has a fine grit to it that didn't upset my sensitive skin or irritate it
it does foam a little
if you experience small breakouts it's normal
i used every morning for about 3 weeks because it's that gentle
still works it's magic
it doesn't smell bad
it's really changing the landscape of my face.
i like that the wash is gentle enough for regular use
this is the only cleanser that does not break my skin out
its gentle enough for every day
tip: if you have acne prone skin i definitely recommend adding a drop or 2 of tea tree oil in every time you use this cleanser
smooth without leaving that soap residue feeling so many cleansers leave you feeling
my daughter tried it too as she's been having some issues with facial cleansers too
y bits are very tiny so they don't dig up your skin or scrape off your skin
this also doesn't make my skin more oily.
it helps with the dryness since he doesn't out a moisturizer after
when i get facials they always comment on how clean my skin is
t doesn't feel so wax like
sometimes i just add it to my moisturizer
i do not like other products that i have tried that leave a filmy residue
since it's so pricey
i can only say the pigmentation plague on my face is gone
the only drawback is that if you do have acne
it is the first product i have ever found to actually help with my oily skin
even though it is embarassingly expensive
i cannot even begin to describe how soft this made my skin feel
t doesn't come off on your pillow
i decided that this stuff was a mattifying primer-
with this stuff no oil sheets today
i feel like this stuff has even prevented that yucky dry skin on/around my nose that always occurs from too much nose blowing
i've come to a point where i don't need to wear foundation or powder at all
there's no fragrance, which is also a plus!
doesn't suffer from air exposure
work horse night moisturizer that does what it says without all the bells
reacts as if it's oily to many different moisturizers
doesn't irritate the eyes
it's in a tube so they won't lose effectiveness from air exposure
this moisturizer doesn't burn when i apply it
i didn't give it 5 starts because it takes a while to absorb
it doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy like other moisturizers do
i took out a start because of it's a little pricey for such a small bottle
there's no fragrance, which is a bonus.
if you want a no gimmicks type of moisturizer
doesn't break out my acne prone skin
more turned off by it's fake cucumbery scent
it is not greasy
it's just a high performance product that moisturizes without feeling like grease
which doesn't cause any breakouts
it did not cause any breakouts or clog pores.
this does not contain a sun screen
not greasy at all
i usually do not care for clinique products
the combination/oily type is right on for that skin type
as it is not greasy at all
not greasy in the morning
can't believe the difference it has made in the texture of my skin
this moisturizer is packed with antioxidants which might not undo damage that's already there
the moisturizer would not even sink into my skin
it's still too early to tell if it will reduce any signs of aging/prevent aging
isn't too heavy on my skin
it's not too thick, and let's my face breath.
i don't have to wear makeup when i'm using it
doesn't clog my giant pores
not greasy and goes on lightly.
only bad thing is it lacks spf so cannot be used during the day
not greasy at all
it is rich but not greasy.
i would rather not dig into a jar
soaks in well and does not feel heavy.
doesn't leave any greasy residue behind
i like this product because of the way it's packaged
i reccomend this product over the repairwear line because the ingredients are not exposed to air before i squeeze it onto my fingers to apply
you don't need a lot to cover your face
it is not heavy on your face
the only reason i am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because it's pricey for the size
it also seems to make any marks from leftover zits seem better somehow
it's so light and goes on so smooth.
and it doesn't smell strange either.
would recommend if you don't mind spending $40 on moisturizer
sometimes after application i feel a light burning
this stuff lasts forever!
it doesn't get very oily
also this has a whole lot of ingredients that my enviro-conscious mind does not approve of
not a fan of grease looking face
clinique --- if your listening i need another creme that matches the onlines texture
it is my gulity pleasure at the end of the day to slather it all over my face
boy the peeling just wouldn't seem to stop
this doesn't as long as i let it soak in.
this moisturizer doesn't make my skin break out
my skin looks even
it absorbs quickly and doesn't feel greasy.
does not cause pimples
it's too heavy for me to use during the day time
does not make my face oily at all
i only need to use a dab for my whole face
to the person who was confused if it was a serum or a cream that can be used all on it's own
you don't need to layer it underneath anything
you can use it on it's own day or night
the tube doesn't last very long
sometimes the consistency or finish of a ptr product that may work for me is just not working in that area aka leaving me looking shiny due to my pretty oily
does not like "dry" up as you try to take your time gently patting around like some treatments do
i also love how it can be layered- a serum underneath if you want
i don't feel that i need an extra moisturizer
don't have problems with wrinkles per say
not an eye cream
because it does not hydrate the eyes.
it's really softening the lines and wrinkles .
it is so pricey plus it's one of those bottles you can't open up to use every last drop
i bet there's still loads of product at the bottom
i don't think it's a miracle cream
product, i usually stick with it forever.
really does seem to have softened crows feet
haven't had an issue with caking as i only use a half-pump
my eyes don't look old or tired anymore
it won't pump out
this product is so good that when i went to get my botox for the upteenth time
for those of us who get botox we know that equals $$$
un-wrinkle eye does what it says it will do
friendly tip: when the pump doesn't dispense product anymore
you'll find some product left in the bottom
it doesn't make my face feel stiff like some of the temporary un-wrinkle/decrease products can
it is not as oily as it use to be
once its absorbed i don't smell it anymore
i love this for my oily skin because it doesn't make my face more shiny
i love that my face doesn't feel like a grease ball
sticky with this stuff
saying that it's not for oily skin
trying to find a face lotion that did not contain oil
i would recommend it to everyone who has problems with oily skin
it feels kind of sticky when you first put it on
another plus is that it's fragrance-free
my skin tends to still look really oily around midday
wouldn't purchase unless you had truly oily skin.
ordinarily i would get shiny by afternoon
i didn't get shiny at all
i don't feel oily or slimy anymore.
i don't smell it once it has absorbed.
i don't like using it during the winter months because i don't feel like it's heavy enough to prevent or get rid of my dry patches
i can't recommend this line of fresh products enough
really moisturizes it rather than sitting on your skin
daytime moisturizer has always been a problem for me because my skin is so oily
or some murad acne solution that maybe w
does help keep my skin from becoming too oily
i love everything about this moisturizer except that it dries out my skin if i use it too much
it definitely keeps oil to a minimum as i hardly have to blot on the days that i use this product
bear in mind that you have to apply primer/foundation/bbcream right after the lotion so that it does not appear caked on your skin
my face is not as oily as it used to be.
guess i can deal with it since it's a great moisturizer for people with oily skin
it does not makes face oily at all
sometimes if i feel like i need a little extra moisture at night i will add a drop of josie's argan oil with a pump of this
i know that seems weird to add oil to an oil free product
if smelling like a summer vegetable is the worst thing you can say about a product
because this is a little on the pricey side for something i slather on twice a day
if you don't mind spending the money it's definitely worth it for oily complexions
my t-zone gets extremely oily while the rest of my skin kinda just stays there
you can't feel it after it sinks in
it's not greasy at all
it does have a smell
i usually wear spf foundations or use extra spf if i will be spending a lot of time outdoors
you can smell the cucumber, but i don't hate it.
the smell isn't bothersome at all in my opinion
i think it's because i'm using acne medication as well
it's not for winter
my skin is so greasy i can't wear any moisturizer
it's the only moisturizer that doesn't turn me into an oily mess
my face is super oily, especially my t-zone.
every other moisturizer i've tried made my face a greasy mess
i believe that it's helping my skin become less oily overall
still gives me the hydration i need without being too heavy for daytime use
does seem to keep surface oil at bay
i don't feel icky during the day.
a lot of moisturizers just don't do it for me
i love that they're oil free
it has a fresh smell that does not linger on your skin
couldn't get past the smell
it's not too dry and not too oily.
it's not too oily
i would get even more oily
i no longer have to worry about having oily skin
it doesn't clog my pores
i doesn't feel oily during the day
doesn't have spf so can't give it 5 stars
zits which i don't think is fair
this product doesn't moisturize quite enough for me
i switched to this from philosophy hope in a jar because i thought it made my slightly oily skin a little greasy
it's light weight and oil free and i love it!
i literally can't wait to wash my face
another bonus is that it isn't greasy.
fragrance does anything other than irritates the skin
calm my irritate skin like nothing else.
the first thing you notice is the scent.
a little goes a long way -- no need to slather it on
i don't find it too greasy at all
it doesn't irritate my skin
even though it's the summer
this is not too oily
this cream doesn't make me break out
so can't speak to the anti aging benefits
just didn't like the smell or consistency of other night creams
it's light when you put it on
never too early for that anti-aging stuff
its not greasy and doesn't make me break out.
it's thick but not heavy and is easily absorbed.
not too oily as i have combination skin
doesn't leave my skin shiny
i've tried to stray, really i have.
it doesn't cause breakouts
this might be too oily for my skin
don't need anything that works on wrinkles or anti-aging
i don't have a lot of time in the morning to apply moisturizer
doesn't clog or enlarge my pores
my skin tone is even
it's gentle enough on my skin even when i don't have any breakouts
it helps keep blemishes under control when they do appear
since i have combination skin i can't use this everyday
i've pretty much tried every skin care product targeted at oily
it doesn't foam as well as i'd like it to
this still manages to take care of the odd zit that i do get
now it didn't magically cure my acne
love the foaming because gets into all areas of your face
i still get some pimples
my skin wasn't full of pimples
i still get a zit or two here
i don't have horrible acne
unless you have oily skin i wouldn't recommend this
i only get a pimple here
it's not squeaky clean in the tight
but you do get used to the scent.
it is also not harsh at all like a lot of other acne washes
it's the red one
she's actually washing her face!
i don't think it did much to get rid of existing acne
it's a foaming face wash that doesn't dry out your skin
it's pretty gentle and no harsh sent to it.
that's the cleanser doing it's thing
even removes make up when you think it's all gone
then i use clinique tonic which makes sure practically all my makeup is gone
i no longer have to worry about the embarrassment of horrible acne
does not irritate my eyes
it doesn't dry out my skin like other ance washes used to
doesn't make my skin red
it doesn't remove makeup so you will need to cleanse with something else first
i wouldn't say it's the best hydration mask
i saw a few ppl mention it didn't remove there makeup i normally use a makeup remover first then use this cleanser
i still have to use lotion sometimes in the winter
my skin feel nice once i'm done easy to rinse as we'll the smell of the foam is not that pleasant however like most clinique products
there is a light scent but it's not offensive.
unlike a lot of products it hasn't irritated my skin at all
this is the only cleanser that keeps me clear!
it's not greasy or heavy
it's not "bouncy" at all
i do not get many big pimples
if you're acne-prone, give it a try.
so you can get rid of them
make sure you apply it after your moisturizer
it definitely doesn't dry out my skin or irritate it which is a plus
if you've never used a benezyl peroxide product before
this product does not trigger any flushing or hotness whatsoever
even if that happens you just moisturize more
this paste like treatment does do what it claims.
i can't find it in any of their counters or sephora stores
it seems to have lost it's potency
i usually don't have any breakouts or pimples on my face
it isn't an "emergency" treatment in the sense that i makes things disappear overnight
it's so easy to use
this does wonders for any imperfections on your skin
not to mention any other pimples i get
you can't see where you've applied it nor does it elicit a big red spot on your skin due to irritation
you couldn't see the pimples
works overnight and did not irritate my skin.
as someone who at 25 sometimes still breaks out like she's 15
it does it over a period of 2-3 days depending on whether it's a full on whitehead or a raw patch of skin
i didn't have any peeling
doesn't seem to pill some other spot treatments i've tried
i tried this out trusting the clinique name to deliver a 5% benzoyl peroxide product that won't irritate my skin too much
you don’t need much to cure your acne spots
do not pour this all over your face.
this product combined with peter thomas roth complexion correction pads has cleared up my skin better than anything else i've used
it didn't break out my sensitive skin!
that doesn't irritate my skin
i tend to break out on whim
benzoyl peroxide can be hella drying if you're not careful
it really helps me with my stubborn breakouts.
it wasn't helping my pimples
don't use it in places where you don't have a blemish otherwise it will irritate your skin
you only need a little dab
that's what benzoyl peroxide is supposed to do
this is the only product that doesn't irritate or dry my skin
i don't have to worry for that particular spot to peel off
this lotion does not require my skin to peel off just to cure it
i can't use this if my face gets too oily
it would break out my skin and itch like crazy.
my mom doesn't have any problem with this lotion
he is 15 and has a bad case of acne.
my zits are gone in a day or less!!!!
typically it doesn't cause dryness for me
it doesn't work that well as spot treatment
i always have at least 2 pimples
when i get lazy
at least one nasty zit will make an appearance reminding me not to be slacker
it did nothing for my pimples
i put this on little pimples am
this product stays true to it's description.
no matter how ugly my acne looks like.
doesn't leave that weird white finish that most products do because they're made for pastier folks
painful pimples if used as soon as i notice them
this product is spot-on if you need to take care of occasional skin issues
it does not get rid of alll your acne
now unfortunately i have terrible scarring on my left cheek even though i searched endlessly for acne solutions
it's gone so quickly!
because it doesn't seem to dry my face out when i use it like a lot of acne creams do
it isn't really gel-like, it's more like lotion.
the only negative thing i can think of is that it did dry out my skin a bit
it's called emergency for a reason.
doesn't irritate my skin
i would recommend this as well if you have oily skin since it gives you a nice matte look
just your average pimples here
my skin was just yucky
it's very seldom i even wear makeup
it really does make your old scars disappear
sometimes you gotta pop for it to heal
that is my fault for not wearing enough sunscreen
personally with my skin complexion i never sun burn except for my face
make sure to get rid of your acne before using it
they're light enough that powder covers them.
everyone's skin is different
it's like it treats my zits
it wasn't anything some moisturizer couldn't fix
i rarely break out
didn't irritate my face
doesn't leave any gross residue behind
it's no problem as long as you stick to a good lotion
if there's anything you do, wear sunscreen!
an associate told me that there's an ingredient in this gel that can make you sensitive to the sun
i only use it at night because it is sticky
it has not given me one pimple or break out.
now in college i still get mild acne
yes it is sticky
the smell fades pretty quick
it's actually hard to find a product that has so many of the skin lighteners in it
i would recommend this method because when i did apply on with my finger it actually peeled my skin
let's be honest with ourselves: everyone's skin is different
it really does lighten those pesky dark spots left over from acne
it has a really gross smell
let's call it semi-regularly.
not just for acne
but doesn't clog up the rest of my face.
keep this product out of the light or else it'll oxidize
any time i get a pimple
i don't have to use as much makeup to cover them
it's very sticky feeling
i can't use it in the day because all the stuff i have to pile on from skin care to make up
remember that it takes a year or so for scars to naturally fade
to the point that i was wearing tons of concealer even when i wasn't breaking out
not only does this help with my discoloration
i couldn't resist picking on my acne
the entire murad acne line doesn't work for me.
it's a must try if you have acne scars you want to eliminate
i feel like its worth it because these ugly dark marks on my face are fading
it's expensive but you don't go through it fast.
ie looking pretty pale these days
you are supposed to apply all over so you don't get lightening in odd places
the idea is to even out the skintone
i don't think i will be using this product if i'll be out in the sun
everyone's skin is different
my old acne spots have faded oh so slightly
it's hard to use it in the summer because the rest of my skin is getting tan
don't know what it does to the skin when you don't have sunscreen
i only use it at night too i wouldn't recommend using it in the day because it can be a little sticky
maybe you should buy it after summer so your face can get tan
even you go through lazer treatment you'll need to use a sun screen afterwards too
it even seems like it's healing my acne a bit too
you should definitely beware of the sun
i didn’t repurchase it simply because i don’t want to use hydroquinone too often
i don't see all the dark spots
it really does suck since i'm light skinned
after trying so many products to get rid of acne scars
it is not a strong smell so when you apply a moisturizer or whatever you will use after the smell goes away
whatever else my doc throws at me
i tend to get better results when i exfoliate first
it is well worth it if you intend to fade acne scars
now you can barely tell that i used to have acne spot
these do not leave him oily or doesn't make his dry skin worse
one of the bad thing about this product is that it makes your skin extra sensitive to sun exposure
there is no greasy look either.
i can usually peel off the acne next day.
it really does have a subtle
they're perfect for his oily
or at least my bald head is not super-polished shiny when i'm done
i even use them occasionally!
doesn't make it oily
don't use it every day
my mom got me these toner pads since i have really bad acne
it's definitely making its way into my normal routine
he says he's gotten immune to the smell now though
this was more manly i guess since its made specifically for men
you can see all the dirt
i even use them occasionally
it's the only product he nags me to buy.
i usually use one all over my face
my skin tone is even
i don't wear make-up
t doesn't feel like it's rubbing off on your pillow
light enough not to be messy
it literately changes your face
this cream does make it sting oh so very slightly when i first apply it
my skin has evolved into the skin of someone i don't know
doesn't clog my pores
it wont sit heavy on your skin
does not do a single bit of damage towards my acne prone
i actually feel it helps fade post acne marks
i don't wake up with greasy skin--which i find happens with thicker creams
if you can tolerate strong smells
i hate these spots on my cheek
this stuff is killer
i can't even *feel* my pores
when you spread it on your face it feels weightless
not too thick or greasy in my opinion
doesn't break out my acne prone skin
most things either aren't string enough
i will continue to use it to even out my skin tone--whenever i break out i scar really easily
it is not greasy
i don't have any dark spots needing treatment
it doesn't dry my skin out in fact it makes it feel really soft
thankfully, this one is it!
it's like treating your skin to a wine night out with the girls
i love that it's made of natural ingredients including the viniferine
i don't feel like i get enough moisture from these
i just don't see any sense in switching to a cream that doesn't live up to its biggest promise: fading dark spots
it's bit heavy for the night
altogether a nice correcting cream
no breakouts, which is a miracle for me.
it feels like an indulgence on the nights when i do use it
my skin is a mess!
it doesn't clog my pores or irritate my skin.
it does reduce the appearance of lines as it gets to work on getting rid of freckles
sometimes around laugh lines in the winter
the un-wrinkle pads that came with it
it is really thick so even though i try to use it sparingly
i can't go without my night cream!
it goes on creamy but doesn't make me break out.
it absorbs nicely into the skin so you don't have an oily film on top
here are some of the moisturizers i tried out
it does look like they are plumped up
but i still get acne.
it doesn't have dimethicone which i think is awful for skin
i don't break out or get a rash
it is not greasy
even though it's a great moisturizer
it doesn't leave my skin oily or make me break out
the wrinkles didn't disappear
i simply love the texture.
it does leave my face feeling slightly greasy
didn't give me any clogging pores
i think it's a quality product which helps smooth fine lines
i need all the moisture i can get
it just melts into you skin
does notfeel greasy at all
my 50plus skin does look
it didn't get rid of all the acne
i don't have a lot of acne
i even shower sometimes twice a day
if you stick with just the soap in your routine you will not do any exfoliating
especially if you're only using it for your face
clean my face it doesn't seem to be melting
she's had the occasional zit now
it sill bothers me
my face didn't feel "clean"
i only use the bar at night before bed otherwise it's too strong for my face
this product really helps control my occasional acne
that's kind of a waste to keep getting all these soap dishes that aren't needed
there is no dirt left on my face unlike most other cleansers i've used
didn't really use the moisturizer
the residue isn't even bothersome
it's the pink stuff that comes in a jar
this bar soap has so much lather
it doesn't leave a film or residue
perhaps that's because i use a clarisonic brush to clean my face
it's like a step above "4" for oil control
there's still a huge amount of it left
i think it does a good job at keeping my acne down on non-pms days
i love that it's not super drying
it comes with its soap bar dish so you don't have to worry about finding a place to put it in
normally if i use an acne product it makes my skin worse
still manages to get rid of my acne
i don't use it on my face
so you just smell clean after using it
it doesn't conflict with perfumes or other scents because it is so slight
its a great product that doesn't dry out my skin or irritate it
i am not usually a bar soap fan
only the occasional small zit here
whether it was a spot treatment or a scrub or anything
even though it's kind of drying
i can still use this salicylic acid on my face
even then it's like two spots max
i did like how squeaky clean it left my skin
if used on conjunction with your clarisonic your skin will feel so smooth
i don't get many breakouts
i don't feel like my face gets cleaned
it gets my face sooooo clean!
just create a lather in your h
always prefer body bars
this one won't irritate your skin
it really works on acne if you give it a few showers
it's not over-drying like some acne cleansers can be
there is no oiliness to it what so ever
it comes in a great water proof plastic case for the shower/bath so the bar doesn't get wet
it just wouldn't disappear
shower as i normally would
it's a lot gentler on your skin
i still have some acne scaring
doesn't strip my skin
it is the only product actually get rid of acne on the body
obviously it doesn't do miracles because it doesn't clear up blackheads or acne that isn't on the surface of your skin
it's foamy yet not as drying as other bar soaps.
think it's effective for my acne-prone skin
it's a better value than the cleansing foam
if it's not used with the rest of the acne solutions steps
just moisturize and you'll be good!
i wouldn't use it everyday just because its so drying
it comes with a cute case for it
i don't use this on my face because it leaves that feeling that most bar soaps do
tend to get some body acne where my sports bra lays on
even though its a bar of soap
it's not too drying when used on the body
although i haven't used this face wash enough to give it a solid 5 stars
i do not use that title lightly
this product is best if you have occasional breakouts
i am prone to breakouts if i do not cleanse thoroughly
it does not strip your skin
hasn't done anything for my tiny pimples
it's helped clear all of my acne
you won't regret this cleanser!
i don't need anything heavy like i did with other oil fighting cleansers
though i typically only wear mascara
tiny bumps on my skin that i couldnt seem to shake
please, if you suffer from acne try this!
it's a great cleanser for those with sensitive skin although you will need to find the right moisturizer
it's really reduced my breakouts
other face cleansers would just be too harsh on my face
this cleanser doesn't make my face really red after i use it
usually everything breaks me out
it does not irritate my eyes
it doesn't dry my skin or make it feel oily half way through the day
t helped to get rid of my breakouts not only on my face
i will say the one drawback is it can dry your skin if you tend to wash more than one time a day with it
this stuff is amazing will be in rotation between the charcoal wash the ptr anti aging
it gets just foamy enough
i've noticed that i don't really need to use masks or toners with it
this leaves your skin in top shape that you don't even want to wear makeup to cover it
i do notice a difference in my pores when i started using it
i find this way makes me less flaky
i really like the bareminerals moisturizers sometimes i use that
i usually spend $5 on face wash so this for me was a huge splurge
i generally use a lot of soap to get my cakey make up off
this one doesn't dry out my face as others do.
it may not completely get rid of my acne
this is the first cleanser i have used that really does shrink pores
i also like that it's not drying.
does not remove stubborn eye makeup
it's the summer time
it doesn't have a strong odor
i kinda like it actually because since my face is oily
didn't strip my skin
it doesn't leave any residue behind
i mean a lot of cleansers
and this cleanser didn't irritate my skin.
removes make-up without too much scrubbing you should definitly purchase this one
it's gentle, and doesn't dry my skin out.
i do use makeup remover first to make sure i'm getting my face completely clean
i've never had bad acne just occasional flare ups on my chin
t doesn't irritate your skin
i like this cleanser because it's foamy
it does its job without stripping your skin.
can't expect my cleanser to control every little breakout
i do need something to control oily t-zone
it doesn't feel filmy at all
i don't need to use a lot to clean my face
it doesn't "combat" any skin problems i have so much in that it cleans my skin without drying or leaving an oily film
which is a big feat because my blemishes are often under the skin
about a dime-size pump is enough to lather
typically only have 1-2 zits a month
it doesn't clog my pores
i don't expect this product to really clean up the small bumps
not irritating at all
i would not apply in under makeup because it kind of has a tacky texture
needless to say i have a pretty bad breakouts when the red devil comes to visit
really liked it because it did not sting or burn or cause any irritation on my sensitive skin
sometimes the odd little friend on my chin
as a bonus it is not drying on my combo
t doesn't irritate my skin
avoid greasy food, not touch my face, etc.
anytime i notice my skin starting to get irritated or feel a pimple/zit/whatever i pump out the smallest possible amount of product
even when i'm lazy with washing my face or when i should have horrible hormonal breakouts this stuff will either stop it or make it very minuscule
this doesn't irritate my skin at all
it isn't going to magically make you not oily
i usually get really deep pimples under the skin
if i over wash it goes crazy
it didn't irritate my rosacea
this product doesn't clog my pores
it's light, non greasy and doesn't burn.
it's fading my post acne marks
it proves that it works to keep the crud at bay
find other acne gels abrasive to a point that it is not only painful
it feels a little sticky before it sets
doesn't irritate my skin all all
doesn't really quickly clear up existing acne
doesn't leave any kind of sticky residue
i love that this line doesn't irritate my skin or cause it to flake at all
since i don't get pimples
doesn't leave any scent or "residue" type feeling
love how it doesnt make my face feel greasy when i already have oily skin
not sticky so you can use it under makeup
becasue it gently clears up your skin.
i can choose to wear or not wear my make up.
**works great as a spot treatment**will not dry your skin out**got rid of a stress zit in time for a wedding i attended
this is gentle enough to not make me flaky:
zits like crazy all over my face
i do like that it doesn't dry out my skin.
nothing i used could get rid of them
this put "manners" on my skin
it gets it everywhere with no waste
it might work well for occasional breakouts or if you want to maintain a clear complexion if it is already clear otherwise use the willow bark
this stuff has def helped keep my acne away its only occasionally i do sprout a pimple
i don't have bad skin
doesn't leave a greasy feel
then i do get a few pimples
i know it's pricey
is not harsh on your skin
it doesn't dry out your skin either.
this is def not harsh on your skin.
i tried pretty much every acne/redness clearing product i could find
be forewarned that it does not foam up or spread very well
i don't use it for taking off makeup
i don't think it's effective at removing makeup on its own
this isn't a problem for me since i use a separate makeup remover anyway
it does not suds up or foam
most days i just wear spf
if i'm wearing makeup i'll use a washcloth to make sure i get everything off
doesn't irritate my skin at all
otherwise it won't take the makeup off
doesn't make it oilier than normal
it doesn't burn or irritate it
this product doesn't irritate my skin at all
this clinique cleanser is so gentle that i get no reaction whatsoever
it's still the best facial cleanser i have come across
it doesn't make it feel tight
i do tend to overuse products
does not clog pores
it does not foam.
i don't think it removes makeup completely on it's own
can't live without this cleanser
although i have noticed that sometimes i need to use a makeup remover if i wore heavy makeup
it's gentle enough for me to use morning
it leaves a residue if you don't rinse well
i still prefer this cleanser to all others i've tried
no suds at all.
doesn't really lather like you would expect.
i suppose that is to prevent redness
it shows if i don't keep it clean properly
i know this cleanser is a little pricey
or really like i used a cleanser
it's so gentle but also clears acne.
if you're a heavy make-up wearer
funny how many of them sting
when you rinse it isn't sqeakie clean
although the redness doesn't miraculously disappear
i do not like the new lid style on this.
it's kept me from looking like a lobster
i like it it's creaming
all i can say is wow-this stuff actually works in conjunction with the redness solution moisturizer
very few cleansers don't irritate my skin so this is a keeper
so redness isn't a problem anymore :
don't expect this to foam, though - it doesn't.
don't expect this to foam
it doesn't break my face out
i will not use another cleanser.
it doesn't aggravate my rosacea
i don't wear a lot of makeup
since i don't really like how the tube dispenses
his skin has a tendency to get really red
it doesn't strip my skin at all
it's gone in a day
this is the only cleanser i have ever found that doesn't irritate my skin
it is very soothing and doesn't increase redness.
agree it might not be good to use to remove makeup as you rub it in
it doesn't foam, you have to remove it.
so many products bother my skin
while i'm not sure how much this cleanser *helps* my redness problem
so don't expect any suds
it doesn't lather up
i can use blush again
can't believe it actually cleanses
as usual clinique makes a product that doesn't have funny smells or irritants
does help even out the skin tone
i don't think it helps with the redness
not irritate my skin
does not leave that waxy film that other 'gentle' cleansers seem to leave
this is the only face wash that isn't burning my skin to use
this cleanser leaves my skin looking even in color with absolutely no irritation
i don't know whether it actually helps with redness because i use the cinique face cream
it is not at all greasy
or were so lightweight that they didn't moisturize well enough
when you apply too much it can peel
so note not to overload on the product
it doesn't irritate my skin or break me out
not sure if it calms my skin or if it's just my skin calms after a wash with cool water
four stars if you don't have acne.
my redness isn't too crazy
not have to worry that my rosacea might flair up
this product is the thing that keeps my face acne free
it is my go to cream.
it doesn't cause any flare ups
this stuff is your run of the mill moisturizer.
this cream doesn't make me breakout
helps my skin tolerate retinol which pretty much every skin expert says you should use
let's face it can cause redness
acne need to see a dermatologist because it's almost impossible to cure both at the same time
whenever i got sensitive skin from facial treatment or simply from season change
basically my skin is so sensitive that even toothpaste on my chin will cause my skin to turn red
think they should make a day cream with spf.
it doesn't have a strong smell to it
that being said though i do only use it at night because it does take a while for it to really seep into your skin
its fragrance free and does not make look greasy.
doesn't irritate skin further
it's effectiveness is just ok
it's a rather thick cream but my skin likes it.
i don't really wear foundation often
i notice that sunscreens that used to make my skin tingle no longer affect me
i can't say that it really reduces my redness
it doesn't make it worse or aggravate my skin
i can't really see a redness reduction once its on
i couldn't afford the cleanser too
i tryed the newer cc cream to color correct however still felt dry
this lotion does all prevent it from all of those things
it has not made my skin too oily or greasy.
not only did it look unsightly
meh aside from it smelling a bit like my local bottle depot it doesn't really seem like anything to write home about
my skin does get red
i love the coverage and it is not too greasy.
it's not lightweight but it's not heavy either.
my rosacea is not that bad
this lotion doesn't burn at all
i don't know if it's actually decreased the redness in my skin
it doesn't totally get rid of the redness
the texture does not seem too thick to me
it's great to be rid of rosacea's throbbing heat
before redness solutions it just looked like makeup trying to hide evidence of all the other junk
i am a little off put by the "non-fragrance" smell
can't live without this lotion!
this doesn't irritate it or make it break out
i can't see any difference on my redness-prone skin
it is so darn soothing to my skin
i don't really think it reduces redness all that much
i find it's the only way to keep my redness under control
it's helped the redness a bit.
not the kind with acne
it's not just for wrinkles
maybe now i can get rid of the greasy bobbi brown products
you don't have to put a costly moisturizer over it either
this doesn't irritate my skin at all
when i do get a pimple
only with sunscreen that doesn't make my face looked whitewashed
doesn't feel greasy with no fragrance.
this product didn't cause any break-outs or irritation
is not greasy at all
it is not greasy
it's not rolling off the skin
she couldn't sleep without using it.
enough moisture even for my oily-comp skin type
it is not so heavy that it clogs your pores
makes my skin even dryer
i wouldn't mind a bit less scent in the night cream
doesn't irritate your skin at all
i love putting this mask on when your skin is not looking so hot
you don't wanna do a harsh exfoliation
in fact i actually have keratosis pilaris
oh man my skin is transforming into such a smooth surface
it's made to be rinsed off so eh
i do use a charcoal mask after to get at blackheads it hasn't done much for
doesn't irritate my skin
the reason i didn't give it 5 stars is that the tingling sensation with this product can sometimes feel more itchy than tingling
this mask is perfect if you're looking to correct blemishes fast
this is a super quick fix for when my skin feels clogged
first i must say i have very oily skin
i typically hate masks because it's such a hassle
it's the perfect canvass to apply makeup on after
my scaring like it says
i mean it's so soft
if i have big pimple under the skin
did not experience the dryness i normally do after most masks
maybe some kind of post-apocalyptic
it doesn't dry me out or make me break out or anything
don't know about the pore minimization or fine lines
this is the only thing i've ever used that has cleared the stubborn blackheads on my nose
no burning of tingling which i usually take to mean it's working
it does not have as much discoloration
it's a good product to use when you get blemishes popping up
it doesn't help with my blackheads though
it's not an instant miracle worker
a lot of products irritate my skin
i always use a moisturizer after this mask to make sure i don't let my skin get too dry
doesn't flare my excema or cause breakouts
i gave it a 4 because it's my first exfoliating mask that i use once a week
it helps to even out my skin
you can usually go into sephora
i am crazy about masks and this mask is my no.
it's like i just got a facial
it does tingle when you are using it
without microbeads as those always seem to cause me to break out
this mask does wonders.
there is a strong orange scent that you can sorta smell when it's on your face
because i love trying face masks.
get the effects without irritating my skin
it does sting some
i don't mind a little stinging
it's a bit of an issue to wipe off.
my only complaint is that my skin is tacky for a while after application
it's not an overnight miracle
i don't smell anything other than my moisturizer
face that some don't like
i notice that some of the complaints are that it's messy
it's part of my morning regime
the only draw back is that it's a powder so you have to mix it with whatever your using as a base
i sometimes get break outs
it's helped remove so much texture
i don't use any face products to treat acne because it dries out my skin
after using this they just don't surface
the powder can sometimes be hard to get out of the scooper
i mix with philosophy when hope is not enough serum at night
i find that it pills up weirdly if you mix it with a high spf moisturizer
i can't tell you how many compliments i've gotten for my glowing skin
i normally don't review but this stuff is bomb!
do your skin a favor and try it out.
i like to keep things simple.
like i'm wearing makeup - but i'm not.
i mix it every morning with philosophy's when hope is not enough serum
if you'll commit to the product
please don't use a scoop and a half though.
you should get this if you have: dull skin
glowy my skin is lately
i appreciate it's not liquid
so stop whining and get mixing!
), i get a nice pimple, usually on my cheek.
!but it stings like crazy when i use it.
it doesn't clump or smell.
i almost want to add that it feels like it is de-clogging my pore somehow
does not irritate my skin or cause breakouts.
when u buy a lotion that already contains vitamin c you don't know how much is in there or if it's potent
my guess is i haven't been spreading my sunscreen high enough for years
i don't use a fancy moisturizer
it doesn't irritate my skin except for a bit of tingling immediately after i apply it
i decided for future uses only to use half a spoon because it seemed to make the already thick moisturizer even thicker
i hardly need any foundation on my cheeks
i simply mix 1/2 to 3/4 scoop
you don't have worry about oxidizing
if you want to bump up your moisturizer to new benefits add a tiny spoonful of this product to it
one jar usually lasts me a year
it seems like a tiny little tube when you get it
it does not irritate my skin
no matter what moisturizer i used
such as not enough sleep
i do know that nothing is going to "cure" my hereditary under eye circles
this goes well under my concealer too.
it doesn't interfere with eye makeup.
what i love most about it is the texture it's like a whipped gel that isn't too heavy for the under eye area
the consistency is not too thick which i like
try it for yourself
they're usually one word or not detailed
does not cause pimples
but it is useless for dark circles.
meaning that my eyes didn't get darker while using the product which shows me that it is working
i do not have puffy eyes or bags
not only this cream helped my dark circles
can't say with confidence that it gets rid of dark circles
they're a bit hollow most days
i then dip my small beauty blender in a little bit of this product
don't want to put on concealer as it has a light reflective
no concealer would make them disappear.
i didn't see any puffiness
it's meant to brighten and it does!
i no longer need to struggle to find the right concealer to hide my darkness
it doesn't make them disappear
even you gotta make time to rub it in
you'll see the difference!
i don't have super dark circles
the slightest bit of illumination vs other eye creams that have borderline glitter in them
t is not very oily
it does seem pricey
maybe too "moisturizing" as it leaves my under eyes feeling oily no matter how little i use
/or wrinkles under your eyes this may not be enough for you or you may want to use it in conjunction with a denser cream
this does not allow my eye makeup to run or smudge either
doesn't get rid of them by any stretch
it's amazing doesn't leave me feeling greasy
so not too greasy for me
cannot tell if it actually whitened anything
i do like this eye cream
i like it because it's lightweight yet great before makeup or bed
being honest--if you have any sort of dryness whether it's just around your nose or your entire face
it's not as hydrating as the more expensive br
there's like half the jar left
doesn't cause my face to dry out or be even more oily
love it for my combo skin so that my forehead doesn't get too greasy
it doesn't make me feel greasy at all
plus it's scent-free
my only negative is that there's no spf
this stuff not only hydrates
gel does not leave a greasy skin
love it under makeup
i can't stop touching my face my skin looks so glowy
it does cause breakouts if you are concerned about acne
my acne says otherwise
there's not fragrance to it
doesn't feel greasy on my face when i apply or when i wake up in the morning
it dries fast so you can go in with your makeup routine after application
it's good for all skin types!
moisture surge is the only moisturizer that didn't break me out
doesn't leave you feeling heavy or oily
because it's a bit too sticky for a few hours
this does not break me out or make my pores feel clogged or my acne feel suffocated
applying liberally to my face took very little effort to rub in
you'll forget you're wearing any!
you've got combo skin like me
it's not too heavy
i ultimately chose this because it is a gel that provides my oily skin just enough moisture without clogging my pores
t is not sticky whatsoever
it was not sticky
i didn't even get one zit
tend to stay away from creams or gels of any kind because even lightweight ones that absorb fast still tend to be greasy
it didn't make my skin feel or look oily throughout the day
never causes me breakouts
i can't believe how relieving
does wonders for my skin
this doesn't clog them which is great
it leaves a non-greasy finish which is something that is m
it's also great to use before apply makeup since it dries really quickly without leaving a residue
i tend to always cater to my oily spots
it doesn't make my skin feel oily
it's so lightweight that i can even wear it under my makeup
i wear it everyday under my makeup
it's the perfect end to my skin care routine
it doesn't cause breakouts , amazing!
i no longer have to wear my hair down to hide the dryness
it's not sticky,the skin instantly absorbs it.
i love that it's more of a gel consistency instead of cream because i'm more oily
it also does not clog my pores
if you feel as if your current moisturizer is not cutting it
don't be afraid to try this product it's not heavy or greasy at all
i found this on to be less greasy
weird chemicals making it have a weird sensation every once in a while
it also doesn't pill up when rubbed on
this goes on like a cream
soaks in and doesn't leave face feeling sticky.
it goes on rather thick
f you want to stick with cheap moiturizers that cump up make up to peall off or just dont sit right on your face use drugstore itmes
i like that it comes with a little spatula
not fake or overpowering
it does not sting or burn me at all
not going to shell out that kind of cash for a face cream
it does not leave my skin looking greasy
these 2 little blackheads have usually resisted until i tried this perricone moisturizer
it doesn't feel sticky either
scents don't really bother me
perricone never disappoints when it comes to facial care
it doesn't make me super greasy
i am that kind that easily get really oily
which happens with 90% of all makeup
won't get the rest of my face too greasy
it's a rare product indeed that catches me off guard
i took off one star because it smells a bit unpleasant
it is not enough moisture/hydration on it's own
isn't a problem at all--it's not exactly perfumey
i'd rather have that than a moisturizer loaded with fragrances that leave my face feeling sticky
no greasy feeling either
some expect a miracle in a jar
i love that this cream-potion doesn't leave my face looking
after an 8 hour day i can normally feel a pimple or two under my skin
have been trying everything in my power to find a moisturizer that makes my face glow
can get slightly oily in the t zone at the end of the day
not too heavy for daytime wear
toxic air environment never happened to it
i've read most people's concerns with this is it's "greasy" or "makes me look like an oil slick
not too over moisturizer for a summer day
doesn't feel greasy at all
it's the one staple in my skin care regime that i will never replace
it does tingle when i put in on
i don't have any wrinkles
it balances out my skin very well- i am not even super oily at the end of the day which is basically unheard of
at first i thought that that particular product made my normally oily t-zone super clean
who doesn't like rose?-
if you use other perricone products which stink
it is light enough to wear under my foundation
the smell is not too overwhelming.
i feel it's smoothing my skin out
you get a bit of a tingle when you apply it
even my skin tone
diminishes my laugh lines
i do like the texture
you don't need to put a moisturizer on top
i think my pores do seem smaller
it's the only thing that remotely resembles a moisturizer that comes anywhere near my face
i love the fact its not greasy.
not greasy at all
i can even feel the softness when i wake up.
your skin does have to get use to the product
as someone will a very oily t-zone
it does seem to suspend aging
i also love that this cream is not greasy.
the bottles are a bit bulky, but love the line.
not too thick or greasy.
doesn't make my sometimes oily skin break out
isn't heavy or greasy
it takes makeup off no problem.
leaves your face silly smooth
this thing made my pores disappear!
it's like a face lift in a bottle to me.
i also love how i don't have to use a makeup remover before using this product
i don't feel any film on my face after washing.
unless it's like those huge hormonal breakouts
i can't get over how great of a cleanser it is!
on accutane you can't use anything medicated or full of fake chemicals
also, that's what keeps me at a vib rouge ahahah.
i believe it's hormonal acne since it's only had a week or so outbid the month
i do not have the typical marionette lines around my nose
this is the only thing that i wash my face with
i tried many face wash for combination skin
after i get little pimples or break out
soft wash that wont irritate or damage your skin
i didn't give it 5 stars because it's hard to decide if this face wash is what is causing my blemishes to disappear
it cleans but doesn't strip.
product that i had leftover in my vanity
i tried this cleanser because i loved the pore minimizer so much
that's true it start to smell bad
i know some people don't like scents like that
it foams up really easily
my skin tone even
it does not cause breakouts like a lot of other cleansers do
a bit pricey but i decided to bite the bullet.
don't expect big lather.
smells good too yet not over perfumed which my skin cannot take
while i do like this cleanser after washing my face i didnt feel much moisture compare to fresh so thats the reason for the switch
my skin was dull, flakey, break outs, etc.
does not irritate my skin in the least
if it gets in my mouth it doesn't taste that bad
except for the smell
it made me gag
doesn't make my skin feel tight
i love that it's made without toxins
wouldn't have bought this if i had realised it had such an obvious flowery talcum powder smell to it which i notice
leaves your skin the way it should
otherwise it's a fine product
love this no-stripping or too-tight feeling cleanser
realize that may bias me against cleaners that are either foamy
too many "soapy" cleansers can
it really does remove makeup
it seems to even out my skin tone
shameless ploy to get you to use too much!
does not burn my eyes when i wash my face
if you are rich, ok to try.
it's gentle enough that i can use daily
that doesn't stay on your skin after a shower
i don't really care for the scent.
can't maintain youthful look of the skin around my eyes without it
it has spf in there so you can skip tthe mess-up-your-eyes-with-sunscreen step
trust me when i say every single concealer creased on me
even the ones supposed to stay creaseless for 24h
because it's kinda expensive
you can feel it absorb into your skin immediately without any oily residue to interfere with your makeup
she said it's better with ridding puffiness than the ole henriksen's ultimate eye gel
i guess i have a lot of fat on my lids.
it's not the perfect eye treatment for me
the product never rolls off like some other eye creams
this stuff actually de-puffs my eyes
i feel it's expensive
i don't have too many lines/wrinkles in the eye area
has a tendency to burn your eyes
it is not heavy or greasy.
didn't splurge on makeup
i don't care about the smell of this cream
for some reason it causes my eyes to water
it's not good for eye lids
occasionally does burn slightly.
but oddly enough i like it.
i don't usually spend this much on eye cream
wasn't too harsh on my skin
'd recommend people with really oily skin use this
it is not even an "acne" product
takes off all makeup or spf
it's just a basic wash good for oily skin like mine
it does not irritate the skin.
its the only face wash that actually gets rid of all makeup
not stripped of all it's moisture
wish it came in a non-glass bottle or tube for the really clumsy among us including me
usually a scent that i would like would irritate my face anyway
i rarely stick to a beauty product
it does everything i need in a cleanser
only thing i wish is more foamy.
this cleanser will do that for you.
at my age you'd think breakouts were long past.
i mean many facial cleansers with there promises of feeling cleanless
i only gave it 4 stars because i hate that it comes in a glass jar
everyone's skin is different
sometimes waterproof mascara requires an extra go
it doesn't seem to cleanse quite as well
the new pump seems a little flimsy
it doesn't make my skin feel too tight
it's as if the "dullness" gets washed away a little every day
it's pricey, but it goes a long way.
can't really give all the credit to the face wash
i do feel that it removes more dirt than other washes
i even use it to remove eye makeup
i am confused about other reviews of bad odor i think it smells so clean
you only have to use a tiny bit because it is so foamy
this cleanser is designed to do just that
it not only clears your skin
hasn't had that oily rebound effect like it usually had
this works well and doesn't make your face oily.
does no remove all of my eye makeup
if you are wanting a cleanser that actually leaves your face feeling clean
once it's on the lids it does have a somewhat strange smell
the cream did not sting or smell
i don't think it's hydrating enough
doesn't have a strong scent like some of perricon's products do
even saw some scary looking bra thingies you're supposed to wear at night
it's the only face product i use
i find i often don't need a moisturizer with this product
think it can't change without fillers you have to try this
not just in toning
you'll take a hammer to it just to get out any precious tiny remaining bits you can
it's recommended that you use it 3x a week
it's hard to push down
just about every other toner i've ever tried dries out
i actually thought this would be just another toner
you'll see results right away
please keep this in mind: if you're too sensitive to scent/fragrance this might not suit you
i love that you only need one pump to get a good lather going
it doesn not do a good job of make up removal so you definitely need to remove funny before washing with this cleanser
some cream cleansers didn't clean enough
it can bother you because the scent is not too subtle
doesn't make me red after washing
i am not a big fan of foam cleansers
i prefer foaming cleansers that aren't too harsh
moisturizer really isn't needed using this face wash either
it's gentle enough for a nice double wash on makeup days
it does make your skin a little tight immediately after use
it isn't irritating to my skin to do so
it may be worth a try for those with an oiler skin type or maybe my face is just sensitive to it
it doesn't require a lot of product to get your skin clean
doesn't leave you feeling stripped
it's no match for my liner/mascara
none have gotten every speck of makeup off like this one does
i love the pump dispenser too.
blackheads all over my cheeks which is the only place that's never had a problem
this is the first cleanser i can remember using that doesn't leave me feeling dry
im not sure if this is irritating my acne or the "fresh" rose deep hydration cream i love the oranges smell it cleans well too
it also does not irritate my skin.
the foam of the product makes you feel like you are cleaning your face
this cleaners smells soon good
it removes everything on my face even waterproof makeup
love everything about this cleanser except the price tag
it's not too expensive.
you really should be using a makeup remover first before cleansing
when you really need water instead of the sahara desert
i'll be dammed if it didn't clear up my acne as a bonus
not for getting deep cleansing done like i prefer at night
i truly recommend this foam cleaners it truly cleans
i do use a bit of cetaphil to remove makeup
if i don't apply my moisturizer within 10 min my skin may feel dry
it doesn't seem to be a deep cleanser
when used with my clarisonic it does not foam up my face
this cleanser actually makes me look forward to washing my face
<<insert severe side eye here>> yes ladies
it has also done wonders to reduce how oily my skin gets
because i was used to the squeaky-clean feeling that came with other cleansers
it hydrates my oily t-zone without adding anymore grease to it
this cleanser doesn't break me out or irritate my skin
it's not as drying as you would think for a flaming cleanser
i mean heavy it comes off with one wash
it works great with a spin brush if you have
this bottle lasts forever
it's my go-to cleanser
although it's a foam it really cuts through the dirt
it doesn't leave my skin feeling tight like other cleansers out there
i gave it 4 stars cuz it's sticky once applied.
's skin care on top--one plump is enough therefore one bottle lasts well--love the classic guerlain scent
like a time machine for your skin
i wouldn't recommend anything else for thirsty skin
i like the fact that it's in a pump so there's no contamination with h
my skin can go crazy with breakouts
wow i just can't stop wanting to touch my face its so soft
not only is ren a natural product with no nasty ingredients
no matter what kind of lotion i use my cheeks get very red
i don't fee this makes me oily during the day
doesn't interfere with my makeup
t doesn't add to my skin issues
this actually puts some moisture into your skin people
doesn't sit on top of your skin
now that it's summer
it's not sticky after application
this is an amazing moisturizer that doesn't make me break out
there's no greasy feel when you wake up in the morning
neosporin couldn't touch this problem
i must said i was worried it would be too oily for my skin
it's not heavy or oily
use it as my day cream and it works wonders!
it doesn't bother my sensitive skin
is lightweight enough not to leave me oily at all
not too oily at all.
i simply cannot wear your moisturizer
does not clog pores or anything side effects
i wanted to get something organic since everything you put on your body is absorbed through your skin
doesn't rely on junk to make it feel great- it glides on
doesn't leave skin feeling sticky the way some moisture lotions can
try it out you'll love it!!!
it comes out like a cream
i like to use this at night just because it's a little bit too thick for daytime
it is not super oily or heavy
it's a little too heave of a formulation for my acne prone skin
only thing is that it can make the skin a bit too oily/shiny
not a big fan of this dispenser
you can't smell it on your face
it will not make me oily
usually my t-zone does get super oily
other than that it's a gem.
it goes good with my bb cream so even if there is no spf my bb cream has an spf of 35
so you won't have any trouble with it absorbing
t doesn't work very well with most of my oil-free primers
would definitely encourage anyone with oily skin to use it
not do not have very oily skin
i told the sales clerk that i needed a moisturizer that works well for combination skin cause i am oily in the t-zone
this would be great under makeup cause it leaves your skin smooth
doesn't leave a film on the skin
it's not heavy or greasy
he has oily skin and doesn't have a problem.
it doesn't have an spf
however, it does fill kind of thick.
it does not leave your skin with a matte finish
i don't wear makeup everyday
this not only melts into my skin leaving no residue
didn't leave a greasy feel or residue
even though this is for normal skin it doesn't cause breakouts
this doesn't cause a pore clogging problem
if anything it's a fresh
i think a lot of the people commenting that it's oily
i also feel it does kind of clog my pores
i don't know why it's labeled a day cream when it's got no spf
i like that this moisturizer does not effect the way my primer or makeup mattes my shine
i agree with a previous review that is does make my skin feel a little sweaty after use
might not be the best for someone with oily skin
doesn't burn when i'm applying it
what i don't like is the packaging as i prefer tubes or pots nor do i like the fact that this moisturizer sits on my skin for 5 minutes before absorbing in
i can't claim that this is better than any other sensitive skin cream i've used
didn't feel bad throwing it away
it's helped some areas of my face
doesn't irritate my skin
it didn't feel heavy or greasy.
it didn't make me oily at all either which is a huge plus
i can't say that it reduces my redness
it definitely doesn't irritate my skin or cause breakouts
glad to find a daytime moisturizer without gobs of spf because as a person of color
the smell is weird but otherwise i love it!
this stuff is stupid expensive
doesn't leave an oily film
does not leave skin oily at all
i wasn't too keen on the scent
it's light on the face
doesn't make the skin break out
i don't always feel like wearing my bb cream just for sun protection
enough to not irritate my skin
it does leave my skin a little bit greasy
i don't normally put on any face makeup because i don't like how heavy it feels
it doesn't make me more oily in the typically oily areas either
there isn't much of a fragrance to me
i like that it's free-from so many bad ingredients
not perfumey which is good i guess.
not leave my skin all sticky
does not feel heavy or tacky
hot for a little bit so before putting makeup on i suggest a mattifying primer
doesn't sit heavily either
i know it says it's a day cream
i guess for me this is sensitive skin holy grail skin care
made my skin not greasy
it does not irritate my skin
isn't greasy at all
that won't sting my skin or cause breakouts
i don't like the smell
it does it's job, fast-absorbing, non-greasy.
how can this be a protection day cream if it doesn't protect from the sun??
finding an intense moisturizer that doesn't irritate or clog my skin has been really tough
doesn't irritate me at all
i feel like that word has negative connotations
can't imagine using any other face cream now.
like it can still breath
it's great for daytime use
i don't use it daily because it's quite expensive for the size
it doesn't have spf
what smell it does have is like a clean/ natural-barely there yet very yummy
or sensitive skin that can also have some redness then give this a shot b/c it's a wonderful product all around the board
i always found that other creams make my skin sting
doesn't also leave me greasy
it doesn't cause me to break out nor does it clog my pores
doesn't leave leave me oily
i can't use it as my night time moisturizer just because i do need a little more hydration
however people with oily skin could probably get away with it
you must try this it is non oily
this has been the only moisturizer that my super sensitive teen could tolerate that actually helped keep her shine free all day
my tzone is no longer uber shiny when it gets later in the day
not shiny all day long
i usually don't wear moisturizer because it makes me feel oily afterwards or after a couple uses
it sinks right into my skin for a satin-like feel
it certainly did not have a shiny or greasy finish at all
but not matte either.
i can't believe it, it's like clearing my skin.
don't irritate my skin
its a nice "in between" for my slightly oily t zone
the resurfacing aha concentrate were not too stingy on me
it's just right amount of balance.
love how non greasy this formula is
you can just feel the difference in it's natural ingredients
it doesn't really address my oily t-zone
it does not feel oily or greasy
i gave it a 4 star rating cause it wasn't hydrating enough
now that it's the summer
not too mattifying though
it didn't help hydrate my skin enough
it didn't irritate my skin
i don't need to blot
i can't use most primers because they break me out or they are so dry after application my mineral makeup won't stick
this doesn't make me completely shine free
t smells a little intense when first applied
does not leave it feeling greasy
stuff either made me oily or it gave me a rash
i know it's a bit pricy
this moisturizer really does help control oil
does not leave skinfeeling oily
finally a moisturizer that doesn't feel like i'm just making my t-zone shinier
i started using this in the summer when my t-zone gets very oily
doesn't make my skin oily like other products i have used
it doesn't keep the oil from breaking through my makeup
this stuff helped get rid of my adult acne.
if it takes away my shiny t zone it will work for anyone
there is enough to put a thick layer on your face
t doesn't dry your face out
don’t waste your money on the cheap stuff.
this mask comes in a little pod
the little brush is a huge bonus as it makes applying the mask super-easy
even if you don't it breaks down to 9 buck a facial which is pretty sweet
i usually smoke while i have mask on
i love the way your skin 'cools' while the mask is on
makeup removers never seems to work
it's my go to item when i want to look refreshed
i think it's meant to be more gentle
i like the smell even if it is typically considered a man's product
you'll look like you just had a deep cleansing session at a spa
is the only thing that doesn't sting on my face during a breakout
some days i go without any makeup because of the dewy
for anti-aging i can't really tell
for people that don't like the smell
though it's not a strong scent
not end up looking super oily
doesn't have much of a scent.
even knowing it was the reason i was super oily
it's not heavy that works perfectly in summer as well
can't complain fresh products.
at night it is the only thing i have tried that quenches my skin
will make your face seem a bit oily until it soaks in
i would say it's more of a night cream bc it's too heavy for a day cream
it did not make my skin oilier as some have experienced
this doesn't feel greasy to me at all
it might be too heavy for someone with really oily skin
i would say it's a good nighttime cream
i find the black tea products a bit on the pricey side for me
you'll enjoy how they make you look
it's a tall order that usually is not filled.
it's certainly a rich cream
you just can't go wrong with the fresh black tea line
i would not recommend this for someone with oily skin
minus one star because it's way too expensive for such a tiny jar
i get no reaction from this cream
for me it's too rich for t zone during day time.
not good for users with nails
this stuff is so greasy
it's not like a painful tingle
it reminds me a bit like the korres cream in terms of thickness
becasue the cream is so rich with plenty of slip
not oily at all even though it's my skin's type
this is a bit too much on the greasy/oily side for me to wear during the day
it seems like it turns into an oil??
this the fresh moisturizer doesnt seem to sink in like those do
usually i get tired of creams because over time they don't work as well
i like it as a night cream or on days when i'm not wearing makeup
my skin literally looks as though it's glowing!
doesn't leave a greasy residue
my only complaint is it is sooo darn expensive
since i'm so oily i use this only at night
it does not leave me oily in the morning at all!
my only disappointment with this product is that it's in a jar
i hate the fact that the cream is exposed to air
does not make my often acne-prone skin break out at all
sometimes i sleep in it.
i think it calms any acne or scaring i might have
as i want to stop wearing makeup
this mask does everything for my complexion!
f you use this before you put your makeup on it totally helps with a flawless look because it makes your skin so smooth
makes skin seem pore-less, even toned and matte!
soothing that i didn't want to wash it off
not greasy at all!
it doesn't make your skin dry nor greasy
it gives your face little tingles
makes your skin feel like a baby's butt
it's the type of mask that delivers results that actually last
no matter your skin type
it's not drying, or greasy; it's just perfect.
it's easy to rinse off
doesn't smell so bad
even though it's pricey
the mask's texture isnt like anything i've ever tried before- its like a cream
if you are acne prone
i usually don't use masks because i'm too lazy to ever use them consistently
the tingling sensation maybe good...i can't tell.
any time i use water on my face i feel i need a moisturizer
makes your skin look like it does when you are using the beauty or soft focous filter on your camera
smell is just a plus
as a pale 20 year old that basically can't ever go in the sun
my sample was not gritty as some others' have seemed to be
i rinsed the mask off after 20 minutes because i didn't know how my oily skin would react if i left it on
if you are a person who doesn't mind a cooling sensation on the face
i just make all the purchases for my household cuz my mother would never use any of the extra rouge perks like makeovers
i don't rinse it off i just let it absorb into my skin
i usually wear this at night
makes you look like you've slept for 9 hours
i don't find its a treatment mask
the texture isn't my favourite to be honest
maybe because i am squeamish about spending $92 on the full size
i find that it leaves my skin
my face tends to look dull
besides that it's just a great way to pamper yourself
it really works wonders if you have tired skin thats been over scrubbed or if you have slight wrinkles
once i rinse it off, my skin does feel softer.
that doesn't bother me because this clears up my skin like no other cleanser i've used
removes all my makeup yet leaves no residue behind
i can't attest to how it takes off makeup
use a small amount that's enough to cleanse my face
it's a super simple press-on
not so with this cleanser
doesn't irritate skin at all
it smells so fresh and is so easy to apply.
i like the way it removes even stubborn eye makeup yet leaves my face soft as well as clean
it's clear up my acne
it may seem pricey
don't want to use any harsh soup for daily use or when i don't need extra scrubbing
you can feel it deep cleansing
it's gentle yet really cleans
when i follow it with my toner there's never even any dirt left behind
e this to all the natural ingredients that do not irritate my skin
a little dab does the job so you don't feel guilty about the price
if i use something made for rosacea my skin doesn't feel clean
some products actually sting
i don't want to leave any oil on my combination skin
it really gets the skin clean/ even removes my mascara
it's simply soft and cleansed.
doesn't mean to remove all makeup so should use it with toner afterward
it doesn't try out my skin
it never smells too strong or irritates my skin
it doesn't leave my skin dry or slimy.
i love that you don't need a lot to clean your face
t does remove my eye makeup very well
just make sure your gentle with your eye area becuase of the super thin skin in that area
although it's recommended that it's massaged in for best makeup removal
it is a very good cleanser if u like the squeaky clean feeling
it's gentle enough to my skin
i like that it foams when you add water.
the foam really gets to work on removing my makeup
the reason i took off one star is that the scent is a little too perfume-y for my liking
it stings a little if you accidentally get it into your eyes
at first i didn't like the way my skin felt after because it gave me that squeaky clean which i don't like
not only does it thoroughly clean my skin
doesn't strip my face and feels clean afterwards.
i usually use a simple face wipe to get any makeup left on my face
it wasn't needed- there wasn't a speck of makeup left
it's not too harsh
have to say it's a great cleanser for combination to oil skin
doesn't leave you feeling overly dry.
it foams up a little
it takes all your makeup off
definitely think it's good for oily skin types
somehow doesn't leave skin oily
it is strong enough to remove your makeup
gentle enough to not strip away of all moisture from your face
in a minute you've got a squeaky clean face
probably only the fab face wash
i feel like it removes my stubborn eye makeup
though it's not overpowering
i don't tend to invest in cleansers as much as i do masks
it's pricey to buy regularly
it gets all my makeup
nothing a bit of moisturizer can't help counteract
i think this would be a great cleanser for anyone with combination or oily skin
it took some getting used to because i had gotten accustomed to cleansers that would make my skin feel "squeaky clean" right after washing
it only takes the tiniest bit to get all of my makeup off
it lasts forever, too!
let me tell you it is non-drying
you usually won't need to wash a second time unless you've really caked on :
don't fret about the price: you need so little product to create big foam
not so foamy but i love the clean i'm left with.
foams up slightly so you can easily cover face
don't need to use much since the foaming effect works great
this cleanser really takes off eye makeup.
doesn't make my skin feel dry.
it doesn't burn or leave my skin feeling tight like many cleansers
you will feel the makeup 100% removed.
actually evens out my skin type
it's done wonders for keeping the redness from my stress acne down
although i still prefer to use this product with my acne wash
this product is a cream that foams up when you add a little water
i am 42 with aging skin that still gets breakouts
there's no scent to it nor is it oily on the face
especially if you're lazy at night like me
i love how i can clean my face easily
doesn't feel dried out at all
it's good for any eyes or lip makeup.
great when your in a hurry/lazy
won't remove your mascara well
of course dont believe in magic that this will get you off your mascara
doesn't irritate my skin
i needed something to remove makeup
i think it could do a better job of removing my hypnôse drama mascara
it doesn't upset my neurotic skin
a regular cleanser does not remove makeup this thoroughly
it's no good for eye makeup though.
i liked it for cleansing in the morning when i didn't feel like doing a full cleanse
i do love this product to remove my make up not only because it isn`t rough like the majority of the good make up removers
i do not have to rinse it off.
even those hard-to-come-off lipsticks
no matter what makeup i wear...this removes it!
even if you haven't applied makeup
it does remove everything
and it's a easy cleanser w/out water.
it's difficult to find a make up remover for oily skin
this is great when i'm lazy & not wearing makeup.
if you want a make-up remover
then i recommend the bi-facial lancôme make-up remover that's way better for this purpose
doesn't irritate my skin or burn my eyes
works on waterproof if you let the cotton disc sit on your eye like 5-10secs
on my lazy days, this is the way to go.
needed a quick fix to gently remove makeup on those nights i was too tired or lazy to do a full cleansing
i'd much rather wash my face with soap
however i dont think it is a good idea to either use it as a daily basic or use it as your eye makeup remover
or as clean as you can without actually washing it
doesn't leave a film or your skin oily
it does not work well for eye cleansing
this product is good to remove any left over makeup or mascara after you've cleansed your face
i don't think that it's a total cleanser just by itself
it's often sold out so if it's in stick buy two!
it doesn't remove it all
i also love the fact that it's not greasy.
i love it's light scent, plus it's non drying.
does not leave my skin looking oily
it does wonders to the rest of my makeup application
everytime i would do my makeup it would look cakey or flakey
doesn't make my skin overly oily
not only did my acne go away my skin texture improved
it's a regular part of my beauty routine!
not get oil everywhere
only thing i don't like is the lid.
it doesn't seal on very tight
tricks your skin into thinking it doesn't need to over produce oil
unlike most oils it doesn't feel heavy on your face or come off on your clothes or pillow
it's the only moisturizer for my under eyes that works at night
it's great for a no makeup day or overnight
the skin around my lips would also often swell up even when i did not touch it
f you don't like looking very oily it's probably not a good choice for you
not have to worry about having an oily-look
it's helped most of my symptoms go away except for a particularly stubborn area
it honestly does work for making your face dewy
their marula oil doesn't do anything for my skin
i can't believe this stuff made my hair soft
i add just a literal drop of this to my night time moisturizer
at first i didn't like it because it made my skin too oily
though my thirsty hair will take a whole dropper full
fasali didn't moisturize me enough
my skin doesn't feel dry, or stretching anymore.
this oil does wonders for your skin
it doesn't feel sticky at all.
don't be afraid of the 'oil' -- it won't make you more oily
typically if you have very oily skin what's happening is your skin is lacking hydration
it's going to balance your skin out.
i feel like my pores are never clogged
or apply it when my hair is messy to give it the perfect structure
it's totally worth it bc i had super dry skin before this
i don't have oily skin anymore either.
this does not irritate my skin at all
when they aren't covered with makeup
sometimes i'll just use the oil as a moisturizer itself during the night time
a lot of people don't realize that argon oil only has a shelf life of 6 months max
it does not make my face look oily at all
works wonders for the skin even if you're oily
first oil i've use that did not clog my pores or make me break out
oil on the face can be scary
especially if you have oily skin to begin with
doesn't leave an oily mess.
wouldn't use this everyday
do struggle with keeping my acne under control- this doesn't clog my pores or irritate
my hair usually gets very greasy when i put oil in it
don't be afraid to try it if you have acne-prone skin
not only did it make my skin glow
i never got oily or horrible
i didn't break out other than some other spots from waxing
or it's just a bit too heavy for my face
it's lightweight and doesn't feel greasy.
it doesn't get caky between my nose or chin anymore
always sat as gimmicky because of a lame connection
it doesn't make you look greasy
not giving it enough moisture
i don't have any acne
doesn't leave a greasy film over the face
lasts you forever too
i normally dont set my face with powder
sinks in to the skin so nicely it doesn't make you pile at all
my nose isn't an oil slick in an hour or two anymore
it doesn't make me more oily
this doesn't make my face any more oilier
moisturizers typically make my skin way more oily than it should be
elic acid or other aha peel to make sure my skin doesn't flake too badly
(hormones are so stupid!)
i get these patches
all of them feel like they are too superficial
it doesn't absorb right away
t does feel oily at first
i can't even hide my nasty skin under bb creams/tinted mostroisers
it's kind of a gel consistency
doesn't leave a greasy feeling
on days that i don't wear any makeup
this still doesn't leave me greasy
it does leave you with a bit of a tacky feeling
t doesn't give that instant moisturized feeling
it disappears immediately once it's on your skin
my skin doesn't break out
does not clog pores.
watch how much you apply to your skin
since it's so light
you'll run out quickly
give it a try, you'll love it!
doesn't look as thin
doesn't leave my face greasy in the summer heat
sometimes forget to add moisturizer after
it's way above what the skin can absorb
the science doesn't seem to hold up
the un-wrinkle is just sitting on my shelf
i didn't notice much of a difference when using it under moisturizer versus just moisturizer
my skin doesn't feel tight anymore
if i don't apply moisturizer right after i wash my face it becomes tight
my skin soaks this stuff up!
my skin soaks this stuff up.
as i find it makes me a bit oily during the day
not greasy at all
i just add amoisture cream
i also did not experience any breakouts nor the peeling effect you sometimes get when your skin is over moisturized
especially during the winter, it's a must.
sometimes it's even a little flaky.
which simply wouldn't stop flaking
i don't have to reapply moisturizer during the day anymore
the only thing i dont like is that its kind of sticky
for some people the word acid might scare them
it does not feely greasy
so you can immediately put on your moisturizer
am a little confused whether it is the effect of the ultimate creme
isn't just another sticky layer on top of your skin
which is a lot since my cosmetic-crazed mother never fails to bring home all sorts of ridiculously priced products for us to try
this stuff really takes away all lines, droops!
this is the only that doesn't turn white on my face
maybe it's my genes
maybe it's been this cream
my skin can't go without it
does make my skin greasy though.
i like that it doesn't feel oily or heavy when applied on my face
love this cream as it doesn't make my skin break out even with the spf in it
not heavy or greasy.
was worried it wouldn't allow me to get a tan with the spf 25
it's light weight i can't feel it at all
it doesn't clog my pores
that this formula actually targets dryer areas of your skin so when you put it on it can solve your dry spots
a little oily when first applied so you have to let it absorb for a bit before applying makeup
does not add any extra oily or greasiness to my skin
your makeup doesn't feel like it's sliding off your face with this moisturizer underneath
however this cream don't feel oily
does not make me oily at all
it will sting horribly
it is not too much for my oily skin
just a tip to anyone that thinks that just because they have oily skin
it's hard to find a moisturizer with higher spf that doesn't feel like you smeared grease on your face
it doesn't clog my pores or make me look all greasy
the name of this produce scares me since i have oily skin
i wear it under makeup
this doesn't feel heavy on
it doesn't have a strong smell
do not leave my skin feeling sticky
it's not greasy at all
i like it, not greasy.
it looks like it's thick
it's not greasy but moisturizes well.
it's less greasy than the neutrogena one
this is the only moisturizer that does not break my skin out
it's not too oily.
i sweat easily which can cause a breakout if the moisturizer i use is too oily
it is not too greasy or heavy feeling
the jar packing is just too inconvenient
yet the sunblock part doesn't have that sticky oily feeling like many others do
my face doesn't feel greasy at the end of the day
does not leave your skin feeling oily
it doesn't irritate my skin
you can't neglect the neck area
i don't have wrinkles yet
it was not too oily or greasy
however due to all the stuff i use to treat my skin
never makes my skin feel greasy or shiny
this is the only moisturizer i've found that doesn't exacerbate any of these issues
i usually don't break out with clinique products
doesn't leave her skin feeling too greasy
com because i don't usually take the time
only to seriously break out or become way too oily
i don't feel oily at all when i use this
it doesn't cause me to break out as other moisturizers have
sometimes in the morning i hold my breath because the smell makes me sick
doesn't feel greasy on my skin
it's a comfortable moisturizer that isn't too heavy or greasy
it does not have a heavy fragrance either.
i don't know if it has any serious anti-aging ingrdients besides the spf
pat it on your lips too!
i got the combination oily selection because i didn't want anything too heavy
sometimes i don't wear makeup so this is a great product to use on those days
sometimes it leaves a little bit of an oily feel
i don't use clinique's dramatically different because it doesn't have sun screen
this combo of products keep me without dreaded acne
it probably isn't for oily skin
you only need the littlest bit
needed something that would quench my skin without making it feel heavy
i've continued to use it since as it's rich
this is the most natural product that i've found that doesn't go on heavy
it doesn't make my skin feel greasy
it's not greasy and never causes breakouts.
it does have a little sting feeling when i apply it
i would not recommend this for anyone who has oily or combination skin because of the weight of it
doesn't feel greasy at all
doesn't leave a super lotiony feeling when you go to apply your makeup
i look like i have a glow every day even when i get no sleep
this product is never greasy
making my skin feel tacky
i can use on my face that doesn't irritate my skin
my skin usually doesn't take to non-prescribed br
not greasy at all
like some other creams tend to leave
i guess many creams are too heavy.
not too thick when you put it on
doesn't make my face look shiny
it doesn't make my skin react
doesn't clog my pores
it does what it is supposed to: moisturizes
i cannot wear anything with fragrance
it's not too oily.
i would recommend letting your skin dry for a few minutes before applying this moisturizer because the spf may give you a tingly sensation after you apply it
it has a smooth consistency to it that doesn't leave the face gooey
im 29 so don't have any fine lines or wrinkles
i usually really hate the feeling of sunblock
is not heavy feeling
it does not leave my face feeling oily
love that it goes on not too greasy
it also doesn't make my t zone greasy
for all of you who wrote "doesn't smell good" or "it saids fragrance free
it doesn't interfere with my make up.
does not leave me oily or greasy
not greasy at all
for anyone who gets pimples now
as a mature woman who still has occassional breakouts with most moisturizers clinique superdefense not only leaves my skin dewy not greasy
be careful not to get this in your eyes or it will sting because of the spf
does leave skin a little shiny right after application
it has the spf you need without the greasy heavy feel
it's not too heavy but keeps me hydrated all day.
moisturizes enough that i'm not flakey either
i wear it under any makeup every day
it seems to even out my skin tone
it doesn't feel sticky or greasy like most sunblock moisturizers do
does not leave a filmy residue
does not leave your skip oily plus has already sunscreen so you do not have to worry about protecting from the sun
i don't need to worry about the sun since it has protection
a definite perk is how it's free of many synthetic ingredients
does not strip my skin
leaves it clean enough to where i don't have leftover makeup on my face
doesn't leave my skin feeling tight
it smells like it's gone bad.
so luckily i don't have to sniff it too long before going to sleep
the smell might throw you off
there's no need to use a separate eye makeup remover
it says don't use on the eyes
it doesn't irritate my eyes if i keep them closed
it doesn't make my skin feel super tight
it does not foam unless you use tons of the product
while i'm using a different skin care routine with it's own cleanser
it doesn't leave my skin oily at all
i feel that it might be a little drying because i am literally "squeaky" clean afterward
talk about the smells
this product should not dry you out unless you are over doing your skin care regimen
i don't have to worry about stubborn acne anymore
you only need one pump and it lather up nicely.
i occasionally change my look after work
i figured that since my skin is only a little oily in the t-zone
after washing my face doesn't feel tight
it usually does a good job of removing it
when it doesn't i just add a little more cleanser to my h
i decided maybe it was the chemicals in all of my skin care products
don't get it in your eyes though
never have use any other makeup remover
it makes suds easily
i've used everything that promises to get rid of acne
it's hard to find the right balance between something formulated for acne
something that isn't too light to prevent those stress
some people might think it's too greasy for their liking
super oily everywhere else
not so thick that i break out
is easy to get out of the tube
it's such a lovely feeling when my skin doesn't feel dry
oily or tight anymore
it is quite thick and does not spread easily.
i no longer get those regular pimples that used to end up scarring my face
it may feel too thick when you first squeeze a pea amount out of the tube
let your skin drink it in
no awful smell or greasiness at all
it feels so smooth that it's like i have mask on overnight
it's thick enough to only use a bit at a time to cover a whole surface
not so thick that you have trouble spreading it or whatnot
there's just nothing out there formulated like this one
if you like your skin to look dewy, look no more.
if you can get over that you'll have wonderfully smooth
my skin drinks this stuff up
soothing yet this cream is not greasy
you'll get use to it
you can just see the glow instantly without the heavy greasy feel
i can ignore the smell
this cream may change my mind
when it sets it is not greasy
i like to use it on days where i don't feel like using a long process with toner
this moisturizer is so thick i can feel my face sucking it in
eye wrinkles aren't a big issue for me yet
your suppose to warm it up slightly with your fingers then pat
it does seem to tone down dark circles
has never irritate my skin
it makes my lines around my eyes seem to disappear
i don't think it smells at all.
sometimes need to use another moisturizer too
i didn't notice any particular odor
this is the only cream i have tried that helps itching
doesn't leave any shine
it's not too heavy or too light.
have not found any other cream that doesn't sting
not at all greasy
does not budge under concealer
my mom even uses it
it is not greasy at all
goes on smooth, non irritating, little pricey.
it really does have a mattifying affect on my combination skin type
my makeup doesn't move or wear off when i use a primer
normally when i apply moisturizer my face looks like a jar of vaseline within about ten minutes so to find a product like this is absolutely life changing
it doesn't 'catch' the make up
finding something that'll actually keep me matte without turning me into an oily mess within an hour has been difficult
once it's applied on my face it feels so lightweight
you struggle to control the shine on your face it will not matter how the moisturizer feels in your h
at the end of the day what matters is that your face stays matte
yes the consistency is somewhat like elmers glue
can't compare to murad if you have a oily t-zone combination skin this is your product
it's not over drying or anything.
my skin doesn't look greasy at the end of the day
you have to apply it after you're oily
it's nice not to have to worry about running to bathroom or a conference room to use oil absorbing sheets before a meeting
it doesn't break out my sensitive skin
does not make my skin look or feel dry
after it dries it doesn't seem to provide much moisture
my only contention would this product is that it smells like glue
i didn't feel the need to powder or blot.
can't wait to see how it works with a mattifying foundation
otherwise my face would be shiny
my face would still look matte
it's a little thick but it gets the job done.
i hope it's gonna work the same way during hot summer days too
you get yourself some if you have oily skin.
it doesn't bother me bc my skin looks nice
my skin isn't acne prone i just have scars from when i was younger when i didn't take care of my skin
i like that for me it doesnt make those areas look flat matte
if you can get past the smell you'll love this product
my face gets extremely oily when i wear makeup so now i apply this before my foundation
was having trouble looking oily matter what products i used
worth it just to not have makeup always melting off
doesn't clog my pores
just try it if you have oily skin n feel like you can't use any moisturizer because it's just gonna be too greasy
i can't use it all over my face because it's too drying
even with the awful smell
i would recommend this to any oily skin girls out there
t can leave little white spots if you haven't massaged it into your skin well
it's lasts a while for me
i don't even use a primer with this when wearing makeup
my "t" often gets oily very quickly while the rest of my skin dries very easily
does not irritate my skin one bit
it's unlike any moisturizer i've used yet.
i will say it is too mattifying even for my oily skin to use both night
i get really oily throughout the day
now it's a lotion i can't live without
not heavy on your skin either.
tend to get really oily in my t zone
it's literally crack to me.
use it on my tzone only because is the only area of my face that is oily
i can't imagine my beauty routine without it
it's so simple to use
usually by the end of the day i feel like i have a layer of oil just sitting on my skin
to be honest, i've not seen a mattifying effect.
the reason why i took one star off is because it does make your skin a tad bit oily throughout the day
- they all have some kind of pore- clogging grease that sucks
this product is less greasy
yes, it still smells of spf.
even with primer underneath
i usually cannot wear any moisturizer under my makeup during the day
doesn't get shiny as quickly even in 80 degree california weather
in the summer i get really oily
it smells like modge podge so that's not ideal
it doesn't leave my face in a white cast
this is a must have if you have oily
i love this as a primer for my foundation- at first i didn't feel like it controlled my mega oily skin enough
wouldn't recommend it on bare skin b/c it'll get soaked up super fast
you'll probably go through more
you don't need much in order to get a good cleanse
you don't want to be stripping away all of your oils on your face
wash with this & even my mascara comes off.
even out my skin tone
that's when makeup remover comes into play to take a little off the top hahaha
it gets rid of pimples so quickly.
so make sure you apply moisturizer after washing your face with it
loved it so much i decided to try the foaming face wash
didn't strip my skin like other cleansers
one of my favorite cleansers because it gives your skin a cool feeling it leaves your skin feeling lifted where cleansers don't do much more than cleanse this one does something more
i want it to take off every speck of makeup
eyeliner don't love it cause it takes them off so easily
it's also very foamy and fun to apply!
great for getting off stubborn makeup residue.
it's non-greasy, non-drying, and smells great!
does not irritate my skin
the tiniest bit will lather up your entire face.
to wearing a lotion i'd probably break out
now if i have forgotten to wash the sunscreen off i may get a pimple or 2
this product definitely does not strip your face of all oils as many cleansers designed for oily skin tend to do
you are not left feeling like you have a papier-mâché mask for a face
how it doesn't strip your skin
or leave it feeling too small for your face
it doesn't irritate my acne prone skin
you only need very little to cleanse your face so the bottle lasts forever
because it's so gentle
don't worry about the smell, it's kind nature.
need a product that's not harsh on my skin
thankfully my nightly moisturizer tones it down
simply cleans your face
simply cleans your face
simply cleans your face
simply cleans your face
could not wait to get smother tube
it is not tighty
you need just the tiniest little bit mixed w/ warm water to do the trick
i can't say this worked 100% on preventing blemishes
because it won't entirely strip your skin of necessary oils like other cleansers
i gave it 4 stars because unless you have oily skin i think it would be really drying
i don't usually believe in spending a lot of money on a cleanser
never irritates my skin
it gets your face/skin so clean it will actually squeak
and my complexion ain't bad either!
it does have a soapy scent but i don't mind it.
i do get an occasional pimple here
the smell does grow on you
- you only need a tiny amount of product to get a great lather
leaves my face feeling clean with no residue i have not experienced any breakouts
i like the scent and lather of it too.
typically to get this level of clean you'd have to sacrifice moisture
sometimes you need to wash your face
you don't want to irritate your skin
i spend a minute massaging my face because i can't get enough of how nice
doesn't leave the feeling of deep cleansing
it also doesn't dry my skin out like some foaming cleansers can do
it gives me a deep clean that i have not experienced with any other cleansers
it's true, it foams so you don't need much.
you'd expect it to be drying due to the foam
my face doesn't feel tight after
want to feel that extra foaming
does not irritate yet cleans completely
oil free yet does not feel dried out
i asked what cleanser she'd recommend for combination skin
some don't leave your face feeling clean
it's foamy and cleansing without a ton.
it's not the best for removing heavy duty waterproof foundation or long lasting concealer or eye makeup
even for a cheapy- like me
have even been checking out their other skin care stuff
the smell is terrible and it lingers for hours.
it does have an icky
i love that it's for all skintypes because usually this type of product would make my oily skin even more oily
does not leave my face shiny or greasy
it doesn't just sit on top of my skin
doesn't make me any more oily
not so heavy that it makes my skin breakout
like food for my skin, this is what i crave.
with a non-greasy after feel
for the past year i have been searching for a light moisturizer that would not leave my face feeling oily
let me tell you, i have oily/sensitive skin.
you can put you liquid foundation over it
didn't want to feel like i have plaster on my face
it really works by filling in those little wrinkles on your face
really attacks the mouth lines, too.
doesn't leave a icky oily feeling behing
is not greasy at all
don't have any wrinkles yet
which is the reason your skin appeares smooth
it is not greasy
it's great for anti-aging though
i must say every time someone compliments my skin on how soft
it doesn't do much for undereye circles though.
i love it because it absorbs so quickly so you don't have to sit there fanning your eyes for it to dry
it's the only eye cream that consistently keeps my under eye area smooth
don't have any wrinkles or dark circles under my eyes
it doesn't stay greasy at all
doesn't cause any breakouts
i don't have many eye-area wrinkles anyway
i never wake up with puffiness or dark circles anymore
it's as if i have been getting the proper amount of quality sleep
but this droopy eye thing was not ok!
freaked out enough to shell out the big bucks for a perricone product
i suppose it is worth it to avoid sags
it does work, ladies!
doesn't let highlighter settle in lines
doesn't migrate into my eyes
and whatever you do, do not take the lid off.
i think it's firming around my eye.
i don't have many lines around my eyes
i can't even wear mascara!
it's expensive, but - hey!
does not make a huge lather so you know there's no residue left after rinsing
don't really have wrinkles or serious acne any longer
i don't wear makeup
so on off days my other skin products tend to sting a bit when i apply them
markup can't take care of
using it too many days a week when your skin isn't used to it will irritate your skin
it did irritate my skin
don't stop if the first few uses bother your skin
doesn't need to be used everyday
i absolutely cannot use any prescription retin-a product without my eyes swelling up
yes you get the flakey skin
you'll protect your new skin
some good moisturization could not cover up
it might burn it.
as long as you use this as directed you shouldn't have any redness or peeling
i end up a flaky mess
i can only use poetry in lotion once a week without getting flaky
my wrinkles are not as deep
or suddenly spit out too much product
you haven't yet found a "1%" that isn't irritating
the cream seems to help not only with aging
otherwise i get a lot of peeling
it's gonna part of my mainstay from now on
he's not the complimenting type or the complexion-noticing type
don't worry in about 10 to 15 mins the ren soaks into your skin
just make sure you wear a good sunscreen every day
if i don't wear powder i don't notice it
then really moisturize when i don't use it
my skin got a little flaky in certain areas
doesn't irritate my skin
never more then the occasional breakout of black or whiteheads
it doesn't leave a sticky or wet feeling on the face
the jar is heavy on it's own
i know it's probably more hygienic this way
i mostly bought it because i couldn't find a decently priced nightime moisturizer that didn't come in a jar
this is the first moisturizer that didn't burn my skin
t can make you a little oily if you don't wear make up or anything over it
i love that you don't have to dip your fingers inside of it you just push down
love that you don't dip your finger in to get it out
my skin doesn't feel sticky after using it
makes my skin feel nice without being heavy or oily
not greasy at all and makes my skin look "glowy".
when i wakeup i have never seen my skin have such an natural glow without any makeup on
i didn't get a residue feeling from it
it's my new go to!
this is just enough without making me look shiny
does not clog pores
yes it may seem like your basic moisturizer
my makeup applies over this very we'll
i don't get silicone roll when i apply a primer as i did with the clinique moisture surge
doesn't irritate my skin at all
for those people with sensitive skin don't be afraid of this product because you won't break out or get redness
you can't recycle it
pm they just weren't lightweight enough
it does not leave my skin oily at all.
not only does it smell super yummy
only reason i give it a 4/5 is the texture--i think it's a bit runny so you really have to rub it in
my skin doesn't break out is a good thing
if i happen to rub my face
it absorbs right in no greasy feel
the push top applicator gives you the perfect amount everytime
it doesn't leave that greasy feeling
i love the pump it makes everything seem so more hygenic
didn't have any kind of weird smell like the goat milk
this one does not have an irritating spf in it
doesn't do much for wrinkles.
which means i can't use a lot of products that contain grapefruit
its a nice moisturizer that doesn't seem to irritate my skin
even with my oily skin i worried it wouldn't be a strong enough moisturizer
doesn't leave my face feeling greasy.
you can't tell it's empty until you are completely empty
it isn't shiny and doesn't make you look greasy.
it doesn't irritate my skin at all
except for those that are really oily or need more moisture
it spreads so easily against the skin with not a bit of tugging
doesn't sit ontop of the skin like alot of moisturizers do
most importantly it doesn't clog my pores at all
not greasy at all
i gave this product only 4 stars because i just cant get use to the smell of this cleanser
not only does my skin feel cleaner
this does not aggravate the breakouts at all
how some people find this tube messy
i like that it doesn't dry out my skin too much after using nightly
even though this cleanser is pricey
i don't do well with many face cleansers
does not irritate my skin or break me out
it takes my makeup off so easily
hey a little goes a long way with this cleanser
it doesn't need alot to wash your face when you use it with a clarisonic
whether i use it with the clarisonic or not- it leaves your skin so soft
it's a little pricey for what you get
no matter how much make-up remover i use or reg cleanser
if i do get a breakout i bump it up to the kate acne wash
i do not use it regularly at night as i have oilier skin
can't find any cleanser better.
literally the only bad thing is the scent or lack thereof- be sure to smell in the store or try a sample if you're iffy about it
so scaring is a problem.
otherwise you'll dry out your skin
it gets skin truly clean without the need for a gritty or coarse texture that is found so often in other best-selling facial washes
i rarely even bother with eye makeup remover unless i'm using heavy theatrical makeup
oil is not a scary word
it is a bit annoying to have to wipe the cap every time you screw it closed
doesn't irritate my skin
the gentle daily wash is just what the description says
not greasy or leaving anything behind
been through enough cleansers to find one that does the job
it gets the product everywhere.
even my eye makeup
cleans of makeup and does not overdry skin
it's gentle enough to use daily
i tried this when my skin had become so stripped of it's natural oils
nice smell that doesn't linger
i like the consistency of the wash.
it is gentle - doesn't bother my nose ring.
when used in the am doesn't leave skin with film so you don't get oily or feel tight
i almost don't want to wear makeup!
it does wash all off
it managed to clear pores as well as evenily cleansing everywhere else
i still have occasional breakouts once or so a month
i don't know if it's because of this cleanser
it's on the high side for an everyday cleanser
when i do get a pimple
then buy this cleanserto make sure you don't get any more pimples you spent a fortune on to get rid of
it doesn't irritate me at all
it doesn't dry me out or strip my skin
it doesn't feel as though the skin as been stripped
it probably won't help with acne if you using it on skin with makeup on
which sometimes i use oil in the shower
now i want to get the acne spot cream
it does make your skin purge
doesn't really lather up
keep that in mind so that you don't use too ouch
it's a twist open tube which is super awkward with the consistency of the product
i can feel that my skin is so soft n smooth once i wash off the cleanser
it's good packaging -- sits upside down so you get the most product
i want to try the exfolikate cleanser too :
it's not drying to me at all
it's such a cool idea.
the cleanser helps a lot when my skin breaks out.
this one isn't harsh
i've tried all kinds of cleansers for my oily/acne prone skin that doesn't dry me out in the chicago winter
you'll still get the same results
it does not dry my face so when i don't use a make up wipe before cleansing my face
this is the only cleanser i have found that genuinely clears up acne
i feel like this is the only cleanser that doesn't make it worse or irritate my skin
isn't too light- lathers well
it's definitely a little drying
that's nothing a moisturizer cannot fix :
it's gentle enough to use twice a day with my clarisonic
my face doesn't get too oily anymore too which is a definite plus
i usually give it a break from these ingredients
im a teenager that suffers with acne that can sometimes act up
get rid of my annoying acne once a for all
it's so gentle but it actually works!
i forget to wash my face sometimes
occasionally she'll give them away to people.
i don't even use a washcloth
it doesn't dry out my skin like a lot of gel cleansers do
my skin doesn't feel tight if i have to wait a bit before i have a chance to apply my moisturizer
it's not harsh or chemical-y
doesn't irritate my skin
it loses a star because the twist top is really irritating
it's not very foamy
i don't use it everyday
i don't like the smell much
i do use a make-up remover before using my clarisonic because i don't want my clarisonic brushes to change color
m not sure that this face wash alone got rid of my acne
made me acne prone skin chill out for quite awhile
i gotta switch to another cleanser since my skin wants to
i don't like the lid on this one beacause a little extra always comes out every time you close it
it's combats breakouts without drying me out
it's a light scent which makes it good for morning or night
i've noticed that my face does not get as oily as it has in the past
i didn't have many blackheads to begin with
most people don't like the smell
even seeing my dermatologist to make sure my hormones weren't crazy
everyone's skin is different so don't give up
does not dry your face out nor make it oily
i typically don't have "acne"
it makes my face
it's so light weight on my skin
after one day of using my skin didn't get oily.
but it does smell funny.
this is the best even if i get a rash/allergic reaction from a product this cream gets rid of anything on my skin
i even like wearing moisturizer alone for a no makeup day
it does not leave my face oily
doesn't make my face feel greasy at all
it also doesn't make sense that for an acne lotion
my face doesn't get oily at all the rest of the day
yet i still have flaky spots
plus not clog my acne prone skin
there's no slippery film as gel moisturizers tend to leave
it's not bad as it didn't cause or even exacerbate any existing acne
it's a great product for those hesitant to try any trending beauty products or skin care fads
literally can not use any moisturizer on my face i have tried so many famous br
not as quick as a gel thought
as a base it gets a little tacky like a primer so everything put on top goes on smooth
it doesn't make me any more oily than i usually get which is in my t-zone
think it's safe to say i've finally found the one for my finicky skin
doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy
it doesn't make my makeup look weird
if you are oily all over your face
it doesn't have a strong scent
if you've been giving this moisturizer some thought
i like it that it's light weight
doesn't cause my face to break out
this does mattify my skin.
it doesn't have a smell to it
it is the only other moisturizer besides this that hasn't made me break out
not greasy after long day
i love that i've found a moisturizer that doesn't make me feel sticky
my oily freaking skin only takes this seriously.
i like it better than goat milk because it doesn't make your face oily
so your face doesn't feel oily or heavy after using it
it doesn't clog my pores
then there's the cost
i don't love the container with the pump lid although i was told it's so your h
s don't ever touch the product inside to keep out bacteria
when you don't want to shine
it's a little on the pricey side
this moisturizer doesn't feel all heavy greasy
this moisturizer is one of a few that doesn't irritate my skin or make my easily congested skin break out
it's nice to have an oil-free, anti-aging option.
it's lightweight and easy on my skin.
doesn't feel heavy with product
as it doesn't provide enough moisture
doesn't cause my face to break out
it's a simple clean smell
i don't get nearly as greasy as i do without it
has a bit of a strange smell, but not bothersome.
it's light enough to use twice a day.
it doesn't burn like most oil control products do
which is hard to shop for when it comes to moisturizer
this stuff not only gets rid of acne
i like this and it's not thick.
does not clog pores at all.
really oily at the same time
not sure how my skin is too polar opposites at the same time
the moisturizer didn't feel heavy
f you want a more matte moisturizer this probably isn't for you
if you want something heavier to try on your combo skin
"what kind of moisturizer do you use?"
she convinces me to let her apply kate somerville oil-free moisturizer
does not irritate my skin
it's perfect for oily skin: not too heavy
you'll be out before you blink.
doesn't look greasy at all
it's not oily at all
your fingers will never touch the inside of the jar- yay cleanliness
i saw my skin wasn't an oil slick like it typically is in the morning
my skin isn't freaking out, either!
get really large zits from time to time
did not leave any oily residuals
doesn't make my skin oilier or break me out
i don't feel drenched
have struggled to find a moisturizer that doesn't make my skin feel oily
after a few months of horrible breakouts i was desperate to find something that would tame my acne
my skin has been terrible the past few weeks with clogged pores that were so obnoxious under makeup
i think its called it milia
i do not have one pimple on my face
t's been a loooong battle to find something that prevents
it doesn't disturb the look of the bb cream for me
now my skin is usually clear
what bothers me is if i have 3-dimensional blemishes that one can see the texture of even while i wear foundation
nothing helped these pesky blackheads that are pretty much everywhere
this can make you feel a little dry so after it's absorbed i apply sunday riley tidal which i'm not blown over by so once it's finished il try clinique moisture surge
it doesn't like strong products
believe or not gets rid of your black heads
especially if you wear makeup or are in the sun a lot
salicylic acid products do nothing for my skin except make me super flakey
still battle occasional acne flare-ups
i typically don't use moisturizers as they leave a really tacky
the lotion doesn't have much of an odor
i wasn't used to having my face covered with acne
my acne wasn't painful anymore
my skin wasn't so red
it really does a good job at banishing existing acne
it doesn't completely prevent new acne from popping up
i just have an occasional one or two pimple when it's that time of the month
this stuff is literally life saving when it comes to acne prone skin
bad hormonal breakouts-- this is the only stuff i've ever found to actually help with both
except it doesn't create those dry
5% isn't strong enough to actually clear a zit though
it doesn't mess with my makeup texture either.
often the products seem to make things worse by irritating the skin
then thought i needed a different lotion that didn't make me as shiny
also be warned it can bleach your stuff.
unfortunately it has stained my pillow case pretty bad
i sometimes missed class because i was too embarrassed of the zits on my chin
wouldn't use it everyday
now if i get blemishes they're small
its drying if you use it everyday so just make sure you moisturize your skin :
i feel that it is worth it to get rid of the pimples
after using this i only get one or two pimples that don't ever surface
now i don't even have to wear makeup
nothing a moisturizer can't fix
i get really bad hormonal
i've just started using say yes to carrots intense hydration night cream
while this does irritate it if i wear it during the day
it's great for wearing while you sleep
i feel like it's even improved the texture of my skin
i get the occasional zit during that time of the month
this stuff is magic in a bottle
it's great to use on areas that are acne prone
i hardly have the need for any concealer
this is the only stuff i've found that keeps my acne at bay
is not meant to replace your moisturizer
which is usually a perverse little pleasure of mine that comes from putting on my facial oils or moisturizers
because bp is really rather useless as a spot treatment
usually once i get the dreaded breakout
i did get a few small pimples
behold it was hormonal acne -- it's usually much worse
it also doesn't burn.
like that it doesn't make my skin greasy or sticky feeling
f you have acne all over your face put this stuff everywhere
as oppose to popping or irritating them
it is by far the only product that i've ever used that actually gets rid of the blackheads on my nose completely
it doesn't dry out my skin as much as other benzoyl peroxide products do
not deal with the pimple problem
i don't use any other acne products- just this
i get the occasional breakout every now
don't peel at all
i barely have acne anymore.
it didn't irritate my skin
i get the occasional stress or hormonal zit here
i will still occasionally get a small zit
it will burn sensitive areas of your face like apples of your chicks
it's not a miracle cure
meaning it hasn't made my face flawless
the only downside is that this product will dry your face out like nothing else
does not completely get rid of my acne
it's not a 100% instant soak in.
it doesn't sting my skin when i have overexfoliated
i did have some new zits pop up while using the lotion
they started to feel too heavy/greasy when it's hot
it has no smell and sinks in to my skin well.
couldn't get anything to calm my flakiness i just had to deal with it
the container is so convenient with a pump that you don't waste any
doesn't cause the oil-prone parts of my face to get greasy
doesn't pill under foundation
doesn't make makeup look greasy
it's safe even for use on eyelids
or if you've just blitzed your natural oils with a different product
it's hard to find a moisturizer that doesn't add to that oiliness throughout the day
it's lightweight enough to wear i didn't feel like i had a ton of products on my face
it doesn't clog my pores or feel heavy on my skin
it's such a light product to put on your face.
i feel like it's really runny yet at the same time hard to blend in
love the cleanser too!
does not leave a sticky feeling on the skin
do not leave my skin greasy
it didn't seem to flare up my rosacea so that's a plus as well
the packaging is very deceiving theres nothing at the bottom in that bottle everything is from that silver seal
unlike most moisturizers it does not feel oily on my skin hours later
so many moisturizers just come in a jar that you contaminate
/or overestimate how much to take out having to use your fingers or popsicle sticks to retrieve
because instead of screwing it just pops on
the weird fragrance wasn't enough for me not to purchase the full size
it doesn't look greasy
it isn't heavy and doesn't have fragrance.
this moisturizer does not mess up with it
i know it's pricey
the reason i like ks moisturizers is because they do not leave any residue on your h
i've even managed to avoid the dreaded pms breakout
i rated 4 stars because i find that wearing under my nars foundation makes it a bit oily
didn't think i was going to care for it because my skin is on the oily side
my skin didn't get shiny or heavy later in the day either
my hands are not that dirty, c'mon!!
another thing i don't like is the smell of the cream
unlike a lot of moisturizers this doesn't feel heavy
it also doesn't feel sticky which is a plus.
it has never broken me out as most moisturizers do
i think it's the coconut oil sitting on top of your skin
i think it's a little weird coconut oil is the second ingredient in this product which made me scared to try because it's so comedogenic
since i'm on accutane i'm pretty sure i could rub chicken grease on my face
it's an instant love
i typically don't fall for the hype
someone might see goat milk
my skin no longer flakes or feels tight because i use this nightly
not heavy or greasy
doesn't leave my face oily
i don't recommend this for people that have oily skin as it may be too greasy for them
doesn't slide the makeup off of my face
it is so rich, and doesn't feel greasy at all.
it isn't thick like other moisturizers out there.
doesn't feel heavy yet this moisturizes your face like many heavy duty facial creams without the greasy looking feel to it
it's not too overpowering
i think it's unsanitary because a lot of bacteria can be attracted to the cap
trying to find one that would help control my oily skin
definitely give it a try if you're trying to get rid of unwanted oil
kate's daily detox cleaner once a day so that my skin doesn't get too dry
if you want your face clean
since we can't physically shrink our pores
if yours are large or you're concerned w/ them because you get oil/debris clogged in them making them look even larger
don't think of this as a scrub
another thing that was nice is that you only have to use a small amount to get a lather
it's not exfoliating with any scrubbing beads or rough pieces so don't think it is that type of cleanser
can't stop putting it on my face
shame it's so expensive
don't eat junk food
am not your typical bad skin person
my skintone is so even
needless to say i will be gritting my teeth
doesn't clog my pores or irritate my sensitive skin
the jar is nice too b/c it doesn't have the normal twist off cap
so you don't have to dig your fingers into the jar
i tend to have breakouts around my mouth
it doesn't make me greasy.
it doesn't give me a rash.
i usually don't spend this kind of money on cosmetics
a tad is all you need to cover entire face
don't be alarmed it litterally melts into your skin
s everything in life these so days that is worh a lick
try it you'll be hooked
don't know about the wrinkle removing though
i think it is too heavy for daytime under makeup
it's light enough to wear under makeup yet feels really rich on the skin
can use on lips too.
minus 1 star because its so darn pricey
if you pump out too much rub the excess around your lips
this is the only eye cream that doesn't cause that milia stuff too
doesn't cause any milia bumps or anything
this is a pricey eye cream but it works.
it makes your skin so smooth you might not need moisturizer
yet still left my skin flaky
i find that this serum doesn't leave my face feeling tight like others
is enough to cover my face
will help with freckles turning scary
there is no greasy feeling.
don't feel like i have to slather it on my face
i wouldn't recommend this to oily skin folks
i don't even need my facial moisturizer anymore
it may be a bit oily feeling for some
you'll need very little.
it feels kind of oily when you first put it on your skin
i gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because it is a bit oily
it does soak in but it takes a while.
i actually find that it's helping to keep my acne at bay
i can't believe how this turned around my dry skin
it's now dewy with less fine lines
doesn't make my t-zone feel oily
maybe in july the oil-free moisturizer will suffice alone
i allow it to soak in while i deal with other things like my hair before applying anything else
you might think this wasn't good for skin that gets clogged easily
love it because you can apply any moisturizer over it once it soaks in
my skin never got flaky
it sinks right in to your skin then i usually add a moisturizer after
this stuff is pure moisture without being greasy.
you can feel your skin plump in no time at all
however i find the super thick liquid consistency puts me off
there's nothing at all wrong with serum
t doesn't clog my pores whatsoever
or how many different products i have tried my dry skin just wouldn't go away
it's spendy for such a little bottle
does not make my face look greasy
it never feels too oily
if u have overly dry skin or just some areas of your face need help u should use this stuff
so there's no need for a full pump
a whole pump leaves my face really sticky
it's not oily after the application
i would surely have clogged pores
like separate or get flaky
i often add a few drops to my moisturizer or clarins uv40 to give the products more "slip" for even coverage
iit does go on oily
as long as you are wearing foundation or powder
gets clogged up if i use something really heavy
at first you make think it feels oily
it's actually oil free
no smell at all
i give it 4 stars because it doesn't remove my eye makeup
this is the only cleanser that actually helps to keep it down
my face doesn't feel dry at all after using that
it's gentle enough to use everyday with my clarisonic
the only downside is that i didn't see it helping my impurities
i wear light makeup everyday for work
i usually don't use anything when i washed my face
any cleanser that is not an oil cleanser or atleast a milk cleanser is usually immediately ruled out for me
i wear makeup so when it comes time to remove the days wear i either use an oil based makeup remover or wipes
i am no longer breaking out from bad cleansers not really cleansing
you only have to use a tiny amount to get a good lather going
it's continuing to help me get my breakouts under control
not overpowering at all
one of which was about this face wash fixing someones adult acne
it does not get too foamy which i like
first facewash that doesn't make my face feel stripped afterwards
if you've the budget
doesn't strip my face-- i never feel like my skin is dry
get enough lather to wash my entire face
i can even feel how it makes my face squeaky clean as i use the clarisonic
even though it's pricey
it can not only gentle clean any water proof make up
it even though it's a little drying after
remember not all oils are bad for your skin
you don't want to strip your skin
it's a shame it's almost gone
i wasn't too keen on spending $60 on a cleansing foam
my skin rarely breaks out anymore
definitely one that doesn't strip the skin or leave the "tight" feeling that many foaming cleansers leave
don't change a thing about this cleanser
i sometimes use this on days i don't wear makeup as my night time routine
it doesn't feel harsh at all on my skin
the teeniest little bit will foam up like crazy
only downside for me is that it burns if it gets in my nostrils however not enough to stop me from using it
it works so good that it actually takes the makeup stains out of my clarisonic face washer
it's one of the few that actually makes your face feel clean after using
this cleanser seems to be a bit pricey
all you need is a little bit like the size of an eraser from a pencil
first you should wipe your makeup off either with a makeup remover or a cleansing oil
however if you have oily
so this tube lasts forever
i couldn't resist and went for the splurge.
works great does not strip my skin.
it doesn't have a strong smell or makes your eyes sting
it really gets rid of your mascara nicely too.
i would recommend using the oil cleanser since it seems to make it easier for waterproof make up to melt off
i love this cleanser because it doesn't leave any white residue n it's super gentle on your skin
there's something so luxurious about using this product: between the thick lather
scent, you feel like you are pampering yourself.
this product not only removes your makeup
it's more than enough to lather up nicely for both my neck
i talk myself into trying a less expensive cleanser
i rarely find washes i'm in love with.
you'll have it a long time
there are no harsh chemicals in it so you don't have to worry about any overdrying like most acne products
it doesn't leave any residue behind
only cleanser that does not irritate my skin.
my skin literally looks glowy now without makeup.
i really want the oil but it's sooo expensive :(
you don't need much at all to cleanse your face.
i don't think the blue beads in it do much
i rarely get blemishes
it's not as harsh on my skin in the winter
it's perfect for usage at night to get ride of all the dirt
yet i wouldn't say that it's exfoliating because i only get 2 or 3 beads per use
so it's gentle enough for 2x daily use.
this cleansing oil takes everything off- even the most stubborn eye makeup
it's not a heavy oil
most importantly it doesn't irritate my eyes
i can't rave enough about this cleanser.
i've never used a cleanser that actually removes all of my make-up
fragrance it does not irritate my skin
i don't weara lot of makeup
in my opinion it's a good complement for my clarisonic because it cleanses without stripping moisture from my face
the closest i've come is ole henriksen's pure truth melting cleanser which i really do not like
benefit they're real mascara
you'll notice a huge difference in your skin just from cleansing
doesn't have a lingering smell
there are lots of complains about the scent
removes your makeup like a dream.
your skin doesn't feel dry afterwards.
it even removes most of my water proof mascara
u only need a little bit or it s gonna make your skin extra greasy
doesn't leave your skin feeling like there's still a film at the end of it
the eye makeup then makes me look like a racoon
it simply takes off all of your makeup
not damage your skin
this is not the right cleanser to use with the clarisonic
if that is how you wash your face
it does not clean your clarisonic brushhead
it leaves it looking dirty
it is not greasy at all
i can't imagine removing make-up without it.
it does not become oily at all
i often find it hard to get your h
not only is the amorepacific cleansing oil so light
not overpowering to me in the least
you see the results in your skin
the only thing is i don't feel like i can wash it off easily
it's the typical scent for the amorepacific line
my skin is actually less oily now that i've been using it
gets all your makeup off
doesn't leave skin feeling oily
i simply apply 1 to 2 pumps to my face with my fingers
otherwise it can get into your eyes very easily
i've got to take it off with my philosophy purity cleanser or else i end up using too much of this stuff
i've got oily skin that just holds on to make up so well :p
it doesn't strip off any of the good stuff
it doesn't tug or sting
nor does it leave your face feeling like there's still oily residue clinging onto your face
it's ability to get down into your pores
the though of getting an oil-based cleanser scared me
does not sting my eyes when i remove my waterproof mascara
i realize that one is too thick/heavy textured to remove my eye make up easily
4 stars only because it's pricey
t doesn't get in the eyes while getting the eye products off- splash water on my h
s just enough to get it wet
thought i wouldn't like the cleansing oil because of how oily i am usually
anyone who doesn't like the texture or after-feel of oil- stay away
doesn't cause breakouts elsewhere on my face
that it would make my breakout-prone skin even more oily
can even be used to take off eye makeup without irritation
that it's little pricey
a lot of moisturizers aggravate it or make me break out
it's hard to believe that an oil can help balance oil
it doesn't leave a film on your skin or feel like it hasn't washed away completely
i do not feel that uncomfortable tightness that i normally experience with more traditional soap cleansers
usually one pump suffices
if you can endure the smell its a nice cleanser
this stuff just cleans everything with a splash of water
the skin doesn't feel oily at all afterwards
it glows, and not in a bad way.
what's even more amazing is that it's healing my cystic acne
whether or not i have worn makeup
doesn't clog my pores
i love everything about this cleansing oil.
doesn't feel heavy or oily or leave your skin feeling gross
try it for yourself :
i usually do about 2-3 pumps into my h
my makeup washes away so cleanly that sometimes i skip clarisonic
doesn't cause dryness or that draggy feeling in your skin
i do prefer the way my skin feels with the cleansing foam
the one downside it that if you don't take the time to thoroughly create an emulsion
it doesn't completely cleanse your skin
does not strip the skin
everyone should do some occasional exfoliation
it lathers ever so lightly
it takes a little getting used to the texture of the oil if you're used to regular soap or cream cleansers
now i don't even worry about the oil in the cleanser
the cleanser does not cause me to break out
doesn't leave me overly greasy.
strong smell but doesn't linger.
this moisturizer doesn't leave my skin too oily
if you are combo oily, get this.
it's a shame it's so expensive...
it absorbs quickly and doesn't make me feel oily.
i can even use it as day time moisturizer.
anything hydrating normally is a bad idea for me during day time
i don't feel greasy during the day at all.
although i may need to just dish out the money
doesn't irritate my skin
i can't spend $100 on a jar of this
i saw lots of people complain about the scent
actually not irritating on my skin at all
usually i thought oil-free
does not leave your face feeling oily
especially now that's it's so cold where i live
to the point where i sometimes sneeze after putting it on
because it doesn't have spf
the consistency of this product is not too liquidy
it's just right for my skin
doesn't leave a greasy feeling on my face
it's the only moisturizer that i can wear during the summer
when my skin tends to get a bit dryer
wouldn't you rather get something that works than keep trying out cream after cream without results?
my face didn't feel greasy or oily
if i don't find a less smelly
it's changed my life !
it's so hydrating that my pores actually disappeared
i don't think it's necessary to buy the face wash
it's made my skin
it's a bit pricey but it's long lasting.
best of all it doesn't cause my acne prone skin to breakout
isn't heavy nor does it have a strong scent.
i can even use it as day cream
finally a moisturizer that doesn't make my face feel greasy
wtih the effect it's having on my skin
it doesn't break my face out
$60 creams that didn't work so was pleasantly surprised to see an provement in my skin right away with this
my oily t-zone doesn't end up like an oil slick by mid-day
does not leave my combination skin oily
even though it's expensive
i don't glop it on but really massage it in.
it's not oily, goes on smooth and smells great.
especially now that it's winter
you don't use very much at all to cover your face
it doesn't leave a sticky film on your face which is what i find is the case of most of the other moisturizers i've tried
it's like moisture surge by clinique
though on the sad side it doesn't control the oil on my face
since it doesn't cause any extra breakouts
everything irritates my skin
a mineral foundation that usually leaves my skin looking a little more shiny than i'd like after a few hours of wear
the pores around my nose weren't huge
finally found something that doesn't break out my skin while still nourishing it
does not make my skin seem oily
which usually tend to just kind of sit on the skin
it's a bit thicker in texture than i like
my makeup doesn't look oily with this underneath!
it's so refreshing on my combination-oily skin
the smell might bother some
i don't wake up feeling greasy like some other products
i just simply can't justify spending almost $100 on a 1 oz/30 ml product
have pretty clear skin with occasional breakouts
occasionally i will pull all-niter
my makeup doesn't slip around over it
it doesn't change the color of my makeup either which is great
it's become the holy grail in my morning skin care routine
it's good product if you keep using it
doesn't have any lasting effect
it's painful to have to shovel out so much money for a serum
i can't fathom using another serum
your face doesn't like it
didn't seem to do a thing for acne or acne marks
skin is not too sticky afterward.
it's made my face brighter
i can't really pinpoint my glow or reduced fine lines on this or the other
it actually helps to tame my occasional acne
my skin doesn't show it
making it appear perkier so you don't even need primer or illuminising products
i don't know how this would be on oily skin types so get a sample before you buy
however if it's to brighten dull skin
f you have oily skin you may not embrace the formula as much
i usually use bobbi brown for make up
don't use hope in a jar
i even use it on my dark eye circles
i wouldn't ditch the anti-wrinkle cream while using this
it takes no time to apply this at all because it absorbs so quickly that it doesn't even seem like an extra step in my skin care routine
i usually at least cover my redness
one little pump is all you need for your face--two if you do your neck
this doesn't irritate it or make me break out
it's just enough moisture so that you're skin doesnt get oily
it doesn't clog my pores.
it didn't clog my pores
didn't irritate my skin
my skin can breakout with the wrong ingredient mixture
it absorbs easily into the skin not feeling heavy or looking shiny
did it completely cure him of blackheads the first use?
my pores are not gone
didn't experience any redness
this really does clean out your pores.
if it doesn't remove the blackhead
i am not sure if it does anything to loosen blackheads
i do think it's pricey for its size.
i feel like it's a rip off for how expensive it is
it not only clears my skin
i do not find it drying or irritating
blackheads on my nose are permanent residents no matter what i do
it brings the "gunk" to the surface so that you can get it out with gentle pressure
i can't say that my pores look smaller
doesn't involve any "scrubbing" away at your skin
doesn't dry my skin out or irritate it at all
i do not wear any makeup unless i am going out to keep the skin clean
by morning you'll see a huge difference
it really helps to get those stubborn deep black heads
yet still are plagued with these pesty blackheads
while it did stop the zits
i've never seen the pore strips pull so many
let me tell you-i've tried boscia's black peel mask
don't expect to see your skin magically change in just one or two uses
who doesn't even notice when i change my hair color
you have to remember it's pulling out dirt that's deep inside your pores
i actually have the pores no more cleanser
it's not a miracle cure that clears up blackheads overnight
my skin looks like i just got an expensive facial
i can't say that my pores have been vacuumed clean by this stuff
you no longer can see the blackheads
it doesn't leave my skin red
of course it didn't get rid of all my blackheads
maybe an occasional pimple
great product to clear up pimples and blockheads.
it really vacuums out those suckers
i wouldn't say it exactly extracted blackhead
it really does loosen blackheads by a lot.
he even felt blackhead are less
you could literally feel the product sucking out all impurities upon application
why are the wholes on your face so big?"
doesn't do such a great job at making my nose pores smaller
if i am not careful can become whiteheads or even blackheads
it's drying even for a combination skin type such as mine
what it seems to do is just sort of dissolve the blackheads
i don't feel it's sticky at all
i don't have a lot of wrinkles
i find it can me a bit too oily if you use overkill
isn't sticky like some serums can be
i swear its only because girl products smell really sickly sweet most of the time or like potpourri this product is packed with great ingredients at a fair price it gives you glowing plump skin the only thing is be prepared to get looks for sephora employees saying
is soothing after you shave especially if you get razor burn
it does not feel oily nor velvety
ladies you should grab this bottle
because it was made by jack black he decided that it must be "manly" enough to give it a try
he doesn't mind using this serum because it's quick
can't speak to it's "reduces the appearance of wrinkles" promise yet
the liquid texture are just a bad combination for me
especially when i don't get enough sleep
just be careful not to spill the bottle!!
it isn't greasy at all and almost mattifying.
unlike some reviewers i don't find it too thin
a little tricky to apply because it's the consistency of water
the only bad thing was that my skin is oily
you there is no greasy feeling or shine whatsoever
i shouldn't look tired all the time.
i don't wear concealer anymore
it does not cause clogged pores
not greasy but it is like an oil.
c's which are usually too tacky and sticky.
your skin will love this!
if my skin is feeling super dry i have always just add pure coconut oil
i also needle roll which really does not hurt
you want the product to soak in and work.
don't go overboard but don't be stingy.
sometimes it can come off as rude
i will say alone for the spot fading with glowing complexion it's pretty nifty
i don't have a problem using it around my eyes
i know it's not the dmae because it's in the pads
i dont even mind the "fishy" smell of some of the products
i can see my skin lose firmness
be careful if you're oily or acne prone
there's just nothing i've found that smoothes
the smell is not bad at all
my only problem is the smell
it doesn't smell horrific
it has never caused any zits
i love what this product does to the texture of my skin
it's almost sort of like rotten fish
i just can't get over how soft
if i use it every night i do tend to get flaky skin
let's face it women
it's not too strong that i can't double it up with my other favorite retinol product
i tend to be lazy when it comes to nightly treatments
again it does smell kind of gross
actually sometimes i think my complexion is getting an "air brushed" effect
or just simply wants to add a little glow to their skin
this stuff makes my skin softer
my skin just can't h
yet it isn't greasy
i really like the fact that it does not irritate my sensitive skin like a lot of retinol products can
it doesn't smell at all bad as much as some other products
i don't mind the "fishy" smell it go's away in a few minutes anyway
i don't think this product smells like fish at all
i did notice one thing when i apply to mask to the corners of my nose the skin becomes very red
any good moisturizer will easily fix that
*** moisturize well after using this because it does strip the oils out of your face so be sure to put that moisture back in
you can feel this thing just sucking all the grime right out of your pores
it never over-dries my skin or makes it flake
anyway, it worked for my occasional pimple issue.
i don't put it all over just where i have acne
when i use this mask though
you just need to put enough to cover the pimple or forming pimple after properly cleansing your skin
your pimple will be no more
got the dreaded "purge" so many people complain about
it did clean my skin enough that i started getting these clusters of pimples in places i knew i had clogged pores
it gets right to work on those pimples
t doesn't require a lot of time to add to your routine
i still get the occasional breakout
only apply this mask in my t-zone after learning the hard way that it can irritate my drier facial areas around my mouth
it doesn't treat existing acne
do yourself a favor and add this to your bag.
for people like me whose skin can get oily or break out at certain times of the month
do get oily during the day on my t-zones
i wouldn't suggest putting this all over your face b/c it is drying unless you are oily all over
i don't have severe acne just some pimples here
it's good for very oily skin because leaves your face oily free
i still use it because it hasn't irritate my skin at all
sort of let my acne just take over
the acne i do get isn't inflamed as much
this doesn't clear up all the acne at once
you get an amazing glow on your skin right after your usage
the other thing that i love about this mask is that you can clear up your blackhead using this
definitely worth buying if you have oily skin in any part of your face
this mask makes my face
my skin doesn't look as if it's tired
1 reviewer actually said that when she gets breakouts she dabs a little bit of the cleansing mask
whenever i feel i have a breakout coming on or if i'm extra oily i'll slap on some of this mask
it doesn't take that long to dry if it isn't super thick
even though i use all three steps of the acne treatment this mask really does the job in drying out the acne prone areas
i don't use this mask every day
cannot really comment on anti-acne effects
it even helps a little with some of those brown marks i get after getting a zit
i don't think this cleanser is getting enough credit
while i usually don't mind smells
so only use if you have oily skin or problem zits
this mask works wonders for my skin.
it's not drying or painful like some other masks
i would recommend trying this out it you get oily skin
i don't usually break out
i really like this mask because it's light-weight
it didn't get rod of them
and it's just as effective .
clay masks without an active ingredient like salicylic acid don't seem to do anything for my clogged pores really
my blackheads have also seem to go down a bit.
this is not harsh on my skin
sometimes i will use is more often on my forehead if i have a bad case of breakouts
for people with bad acne
i don't know if that's because of the product or because my skin is insanely oily
i think anyone who has oily skin or wants something that will really clean out your face
no sulfer smell too
not to mention my skin was extra smooth
it has worked wonders at plumping up my skin without making it feel heavy nor greasy
i guarantee you'll catch yourself debating the splurge
it's hydrating without being tacky or super greasy
i do not have to blot my skin through out the day since i have combination skin
do not recommend for oily-faced users
without leaving you feeling greasy
it's not really thick or heavy
i find this rich enough that i can use it on my oily looking
it will rarely have a problem with pilling
it's difficult to find a moisturizer that can hydrate my skin enough without making it too oily
i normally don't fall in love with samples.
then found that it's $158 a bottle
i can smell it on
don't really have wrinkles or fine lines
doesn't smell good or bad
this one actually melts into my skin
big plus is that it didn't make my sensitive combination skin inflamed or greasy as they day wore on
i get break out often
is not heavy or greasy at all
it's hard to find a good anti-aging night creme for combination skin
most leave me with breakouts or not enough hydration
i don't even feel the need to apply eye cream- although sometimes i do
does not feel thick or heavy
don't like the texture of the skin of my face
don't toss your bottle until you check if it's empty
this stuff is crazy expensive
doesn't make skin feel at all irritated
it's not heavy like a lot of face creams.
not greasy or heavy
i can't stray away from this product
this is one of the only creams that are gentle enought to not irritate my skin
didn't add to my breakouts
didn't feel i needed instant moisture
doesn't feel heavy on your skin
i hope i can figure out when it's almost empty because i tend to mail order my products from sephora
the scent doesn't bother me
it's the only cream i can use
yes it does have a smell that reminds me of a rusty old can
the only issue i have with this cream is that it reeks
my skin tone is even
i don't get the whole "fishy" smell thing.
if you don't like the smell just apply your moisturizer on top
i can hardly see the little lines above my upper lip
the smell is so bad
have put many unpleasant smelling things on my face
everyone's skin is different though.
i can't smell the stink that everyone talks about
i'll agree 100% that this product is stinky.
it doesn't smell anything like fish
maybe a bit like a very mild paint smell
as for the smell, no lie its yucky.
i wouldn't say it smells like fish
that's more of the scent it takes on
love that it's anti aging as well
i mean it doesn't smell like flowers
if your product smells like fish it's because the formula has gotten hot
explain that it's giving off the odor that means it's gone bad
smell does take some getting used to
the blue plasma yes, but this, not at all!
this is the only moisturizer i have ever used on my face that does not give me an allergic reaction or cause me to break out
the smell dissipates and is not too bad.
i usually don't like anything scented on my face
i don't know if my nose just ignores it now in self defence or some of my smell receptors were actually killed off
no smell at all.
doesn't make my combination skin too oily
the smell barely lasts
but the smell does fade.
if you can put up with maybe 15 minutes of unpleasantness
this stuff absorbs quick with no residue.
even though it's for deep wrinkles
i don't mind the smell at all
my jar has no scent of any kind
enough to coat my whole face
i only use it at night because i have oily
it's reduced fine lines
there is a smell that may be unpleasant when you open the jar
sometimes without any others
the smell disappears after you apply it
so please ignore the people who complain about the fish smell it's the same as when you eat sushi
there is not a fishy smell that i can detect
the smell doesn't last long
can't say enough great things about cold plasma.
i can't believe the way my skin just glows morning
because everytime i do my mascara i can see a little wrinkle trying to set in
perricone's cold plasma is unlike any thing else i have ever used
the only time cold plasma ever smelled bad to me is when i got a sample
don't use my fingers to get it out of the jar
it smells it may have gone bad
everyone's skin is different
the smell isn't so bad
you use a moisture over it anyway so by the time you apply your moisturizer the smell is gone
i wonder if the smell lessens over time
i know when i put my usual spf on in the morning my skin glows like crazy
i didn't look tired or worn out like i normally do
yes it does have a 'fish' odor until it absorbs onto your face --
i don't mind the smell that much
i layered it under my face cream so the smell wasn't too much to h
i could care less if there is an odd smell for 5 minutes until it dries
doesn't feel like it's on my skin
doesn't break me out which i've found with some other moisturizers
my only complaint is that it's greasy after applying
there's a lot of product in the tub as well.
if you wear makeup i recommend washing your face
can sometimes use it anytime
thought i would lay off it for a while to make sure my skin is not becoming immune to it
doesn't leave me flakey during the day
my skin is a bit desensitized to it
it does not seem to help "natural" discolorations
doesn't break me out either and no greasy feel.
i normally don't use moisturizer because it tends to cause my skin to break out
my face is a little shiny when i first apply it
the only reason i didn't give this product 5 stars is because it is not quite as moisturizing as i need
you'll see some results
it's not drying either
i can't say that it was a mark or spot because the edges of the dark area weren't very defined
it wouldn't go away no matter how much i washed or exfoliated my face
now i've made this cream a part of my typical regimen so that the blemish doesn't reappear
you don't need much at all to cover your face
it's pricey, but it lasts a while.
i like the fact that it has a spf 20
would like a moisturizer that gives me a dewey look
it is not at all greasy
i don't have a lot of age spots
goes on smooth: thick but not greasy at all.
i don't have to worry about dark spots cluttering my complexion
as a women or man of color take my advice use this product to even your tone
you don't need to put it on the discolorations only
you begin to see your discolorations fade into your true skin tone underneath
doesn't make my face feel oily at all
it's not greasy or oily
my face isn't shiny after i apply it
this product doesn't make my skin look dull
the reason i didn't give this product the full five stars is because i have oily skin
can't you tell that i can't get enough of clinique moisturizers
i like it because it doesn't make my face greasy
doesn't really have a scent
my t-zone is slightly too oily for this product
and it doesn't cause my skin to break out :)
it does feel heavy on your face though.
just dab your finger in you don't need much.
doesn't feel heavy on my skin
i didn't think there was a product out there that could help with the red blotches on my face
doesn't feel heavy or sticky
although i have a lipstick that i think smells like maple syrup so maybe i am not the best judge
the smell doesn't linger after it absorbs into your skin
doesn't leave it feeling heavy or oily.
true normally make my face greasy
it's not too shiny like regular sunscreen
i can see them all blending away so my skin looks smooth
other lotions just didn't take care of the dry flakes the way this stuff did
this stuff completely evened out the texture of every area of my face without being greasy
doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy
lightweight consistency that it's a pleasure to apply every morning
this lotion does the trick specially around my mouth it's very dry i can never live without this amazing product
does not get greasy on skin
it doesn't feel at all cakey
if anything it calms my skin
i notice that now even when i forget to use it for a day my skin maintains good moisture between uses
this product is not greasy
i think sometimes people do not achieve results when you don't use a other exfoliating products to help this work
i sometimes use this product at night because the sunscreen in it is a little heavy
it's cooling when you first apply it
no eye cream is going to really fix hereditary circles
(i can't speak for wrinkles because i'm only 24).
doesn't irritate my eyes
it's not greasy feeling
never causes milia under my eyes like some too-rich products do
it's hydrating but does not clog pores.
i don't get a little milia spots when i use this cream
the only bad thing about this eye cream is the price
it`s not oily and you can feel refresh instantly.
i know it's quite pricey
her eye creams just weren't doing it for me
i like that the cream isn't greasy or messy.
so sometimes have issues with eye cream
also, it doesn't irritate my eyes.
i can't use anti-aging products that are too "strong" for my skin
this product does not irritate my eyes or allergies
tend to see some circles
it also moisturizes just enough without being too greasy for me to put my make up over
not my eye cream
it does seem to smooth wrinkles
love that it isn't too heavy.
to the point that sometimes i forget to use a concealer
doesn't give a shiny look
it does not irritate my eyes
sometimes i don't use any
this eye cream doesn't burn.
you don't need a lot to cover the entire eye.
- does not irritate eyes or create milia
it doesn't feel tacky
for those reviewers who find this product too heavy or greasy
it's all about prevention
wouldn't recommend for everyday use after the acne is gone
does not irritate my skin
so light and no heavy smell.
when i do get the occasional spot
it doesn't have a fragrance
however it can irritate your eyes if you get a little bit of it while rinsing
it does irritate my skin at all
this one not only cleanses my skin
it does not strip my skin
none of the drugstore cleansers were doing anything for me
while it doesn't remove all my makeup on its own
aka my face doesn't feel tight after washing it
this doesn't make my face feel dry
it doesn't make my face burn or hurt
clear i wear makeup everyday
this cleanser got everything off after using it my skin felt clean it doesn't dry out my skin i love this cleanser so much
do not use it to remove your eye makeup
forth between cleansers: mild cleansers that didn't irritate my skin also didn't touch the oil
it works perfectly the way its supposed to without any irritation or residue of makeup
usually i always have some makeup or dirt residue left behind
gentle enough to not irritate my skin at all.
doesn't leave my face dried out
i even use the moisturizer that goes with it some of the time
my face doesn't get oily any faster
doesn't work for my combo skin
i takes of all of your makeup like a charm
i wear pretty heavy eye makeup everyday
the thing that bothers me is that it has a mild acid smell to it
there's no need for any second cleansing for my eye makeup
doesn't leave my skin feeling dried out
it does everything you need it to: removes dirt
it didn't irritate or cause breakouts.
it's just my personal opinion on the scent
is because i would warn oily skin types to beware
it doesn't do anything for oiliness
it's not harsh at all
it's completely effective at getting off makeup
this cleanser does not aggravate any of those areas
not to the point that it's dried out
it not only takes off my makeup
which even some makeup removers has trouble with
i would recommend this product if you have oily or combination skin
it's not greasy at all
it's gentle enough to use morning
this cleanser gets me through everyday
the smell is odd but you get used to it.
isn't so dry anymore
it's less-abrasive touch
now it's a staple for me
it doesnt bother my skin
takes away all of my makeup very easily with a washcloth
now it doesn't smell at all
plus no ones going to be smelling your face so that's just a small con to this amazing wash
those usually irritate my skin
i wouldn't recommend trying to remove eye makeup with it
this cleanser doesn't leave my face feeling tight
it doesn't feel right or like it washed too harshly
just be sure to buy an alternative eye cleanser because fab cleanser doesn't do well with mascara
can burn if it gets in your eyes
it doesn't cause my skin to break out
this doesn't irritate it
i feel like my skin is clean without any residue from my makeup or the soap
it's gentle and really good for makeup residue.
this product does wonders for the skin.
though i'd recommend using a moisturizer afterwards anyway
it says it doesn't have a fragrance
great basic cleanser that doesn't dry my face or anything
i love to use it on some days when i just want a quick cleanse
which i would classify gets dewy rather than oily during the day
yet it gets every ounce of makeup
doesn't irritate it at all
i don't think the smell is off putting
all the fragrances usually don't agree with me
balances frothy face wash until i realized that origins does test on animals
it's a simple cleaner that does the job
it doesn't smell that nice
sometimes i am too lazy when i get home from work to use my makeup remover
this does not leave your face dried out or oily after use
i don't smell anything
you're tired of crazy breakouts please do yourself
i won't wash my face with any other face cleanser
it really seems to de-puff
yes it does sting a little after applying
have noticed they're thicker
this product really does help for blemish spot treatment because of the ingredients like caffeine ect
i don't think it's for severe dark circles or puffiness
i don't wear makeup most days
i actually use this on my lips
i can feel it's warming effect when i apply it
i swear it's 8 hours of sleep in a convenient little glass bottle
it's nice to not have to use your fingers
the formula does burn if it gets anywhere near your eyes
i rarely have bad dark circles
i love the face cream so much i tried the eye cream
it got rid of what puffiness i did have
it does tingle/burn a little bit when i put it on
the formula isn't too sticky
i think it's my new go-to daytime eye treatment
does not sting under eye area
i don't need makeup
the product doesn't sting my under eye area or my eyes
probably from lack of sleep or from scratching my eyes too often
it was just too dark that even concealer cant conceal it unless i use too much that it would look cakey
it looks like that the ice cold tip does have more effect all in all its a great eye roller product that i will definitely recommend to my friends or anyone who suffers from puffy eye syndrome lol
i don't travel with out it!
good for under eyes when you don't get enough sleep
you can roll the puffiness out a bit -- not a miracle cure
i don't have bad bags under eyes
it's more like a cream
it's good to keep around after crying jags
i dont have many fine lines/wrinkles
i def normally need to put a little concealer around my them
coworkers mention that i look tired
this is perfect for me because it gets rid of puffiness
does not make my eyes burn
t doesn't slow down my routine
it's nice to use in combination with other products through out the day
it's really easy to apply and use.
there's no more redness in his skin either
thick don't need them anymore
i break out with cycstic acne often
plus it's a lot less than the moisturizers i was using before
would recommend only using at night instead of the morning if you have oily skin
in the winter my skin basically produces no oil
this stuff has saved my dull flaky face
doesn't have an obnoxious fragrance
it doesn't take much either so use sparingly
i wouldn't say it's quick absorbing
no matter how oily you are
even helps get rid of it
sometimes it is hard to find moisturizers because the typical texture of those kind of products is often too thick
it isn't even greasy
it doesn't make me more oily
loving makeup can be a problem
the smell is not bad.
would always dread putting it on because it was so thick
this stuff is the only moisturizer i've found that doesn't cause me to breakout
i rarely get any blemishes
only reason it isn't 5 stars is it smells awful i hate the smell
it's done wonders for my skin
it's balances out my skin so well!
it's not greasy or heavy
i can easily wear it under makeup
was worried that using something labeled intense hydration would make my oily areas worse
this stuff is rich
i love that it doesn't have a scent
lotion without mixing too many smells
it does smell like eucalyptus right when you apply it
it doesn't seem to add to the oiliness
it doesn't feel too heavy
it also doesn't make my skin breakout
it's not heavy at all
i will start by saying that this cream is too thick for me to use as a face moisturizer
there is nothing else i'll use for keeping my skin soft
the 8-ounce tube is a little spendy.
it's like instant relief
doesn't irritate my skin
it's a year round problem
i felt my skin didn't absorb it fast enough.
it is not sticky at all
this moisturizer feels heavy when you first apply it
even in photos where i'm not wearing any makeup
having crazy combination skin can make finding a moisturizer that actually works a nightmare
doesn't feel too thick of clogs the pores when you put it on
it doesn't have a strong smell
not greasy at all
it doesn't irritate my skin
i found it's not as effective as it is on my face-
i feel that occasionally my skin feels rather itchy after application
it doesn't do anything more than to moisturize the face
everytime i get sun burn or my skin is irritated for whatever reason
it is not greasy
let it sit like a mask
i've stuck with the because i'm afraid to venture out in worry that i will disturb my super sensitive skin
i started using it during my accutane which obviously made my skin ridiculously dry
now it's a staple for me
this cream doesnt irritate me at all
doesn't make it overly oily is impossible lol
i don't use this during the day under my makeup because it doesn't mix well with my oily skin
my skin doesn't irritated at all
it is so lightweight it doesn't have a scent to it which its great because my face tends to react sometimes
i love that it doesn't give me acne
let me tell you i've used a couple of moisturizers from sephora
i wear a lot of makeup
uses it sometimes to get rid of dryness
anything that is gel-like
it's gone after 2 uses
it never causes acne for me
i may try fab's spf moisturizer for daytime since i love this one so much
when i do wear makeup
which is just nasty
not have any breakouts or irritation
i tried high end moisturizers that did literally nothing
and it's not greasy either.
doesn't have any texture
i don't use any color corrector anymore
it doesn't irritate my face at all
it is the only one i've tried that doesn't leave my skin greasy looking
it's not a miracle cure
once it's dry i can't smell it at all
i rarely have to use concealer now
i usually apply this after i shower
this delivers without getting greasy like some hydrators
i can't use acids like most people
i've always gotten flare ups: itching
doesn't take it all away
i never felt like i could use blush because of the redness
it's not oily or greasy
i think it would work with combo or oily skin
this does not seem to cause breakouts or clogged pores
sometimes my skin still appears red
what can i say except that this stinky lotion calms my skin
this is one of the few products that doesn't further irritate my skin
i get bad allergic reactions all the time
this doesn't stop the redness completely
this didn't get rid of my red
pm in combination with other moisturizers because it's not enough moisture for me by itself
doesn't come through my makeup
if i'm not wearing makeup
i like that it's light weight
i wouldn't use this everyday
it has a slightly tacky feeling on your skin once it's on
my skin is hardly red
it's not my blood pressure
i keep mine in the fridge that way it feels super duper cool on my face
doesn't take the redness away completely
it doesnt feel heavy or greasy
it's not a miracle cure
not look like a tomato
i become super self conscience when i do not wear any makeup since i usually look like a tomato
the smell does go away once it's been rubbed in
some reviews mention that this doesn't work or relieve redness
this stuff isn't a miracle cure for them
my skin tone is even
is just enough to moisturize without any residue
fave face wash then i make sure the retinol dropper is empty
except when i'm preggers because i heard your not supposed to use retinol when your knocked up
it's also helping to even out the tone
it's not super thick
it doesn't leave a sticky feel to the skin
they don't seem to be as deep.
they're still there, of course.
so you don't get too flaky
i love that this product doesn't have an overwhelming scent
my skin doesn't break out
don't overdo it with this product
doesn't irritate my skin at all
only when i'm lazy to follow my daily skin regimen
it's not oily nor it's sticky.
this stuff kills a weather related zit before it breaks the skin
don't have problems with wrinkles per say
i do use the ptr un-wrinkle eye also on top of this though
i can't live without retinol
couldn't speak to it's wrinkle reduction value
i don't seem to have as many dry spot issues when using either
this isn't bad, but i'm not blown away.
i know a breakout is prone to come as to having acne type skin
i don't feel that i need to add a moisturizer with it
it is mild enough to use everynight
i don't usually break out
i normally don't notice differences
could leave you with scarring if you don't use spf
can't vouch for fine lines or wrinkles
nothing a little jojoba or argan oil can't fix.
the only thing i don't love is the dropper.
the dropper is not easy to use
of course everyone's skin is different
it does seem to lighten my skin
it isn't the least bit irritating
in the winter this stuff is especially lifesaving after my cleanser
isn't greasy at all
i would recommend this to anyone locking for something to even their skin out without drying it
it feels oily at first when you apply
it's not as abrasive
yet it removes as much as the peels withouth the irritation on your skin
i can't say 100% that it is improving my wrinkles
i did rub some of it on my h
which is annoying because i can't really treat them
can't say that this product minimized lines
my skin does fine with this
is i just take the dropper
your not greasy at all
though is not oily at all
you will need like 10 drops to cover your face
it doesn't burn, itch or anything.
so makes me wonder about the amount of retinol again
dont use this product at least 3 days before the procedure because this product can make your skin really sensitive
if you completely fill the tube you will have oil running over your palms
this product does make your face red
it doesn't make my skin break out
nor does it clog my pores
i couldn't believe the improvement in my acne
i've decided to dumb down my routine
like i usually have no pimples
i don't even have to use moisturizer afterward
serum on dry spots which doesn't seem to bother my face
i don't need makeup
i don't have the small bumps on my face anymore
although i still use moisturizer just in case
since retinol is suppose to be anti-clogging
not sure if it's effective enough for deep wrinkles
it's a bit $$$ so i don't use it daily.
this product does not irritate my skin at all
doesn't cloud up my contacts or irritate my eyes
everything else still leaves some residue
now i use just this cleansing oil
it's not overly oily
it didn't irritate my eyes at all
i did not see or feel any oily residue left behind on my skin either
i also love the fact that it is the only makeup remover i have used that never stings my eyes
i just love this cleansing oil by shiseido.
it removes make-up so easily even if they're waterproof
it's also easy to wash off.
doesn't leave my face feeling gross once i rinse it off
this alone is enough to cleanse my skin
this cleanser is perfect to take off all of your face makeup
it doesn't dry me out like how other makeup removers would
i like how it doesn't leave my skin feeling 'squeaky' clean like other cleansers do
doesn't sting the eyes
the only thing i don't like about it is that it spills even when you close the nozzle
wasted product is all you'll have in the end
it's pretty wallet-friendly
it does a great job of taking off my more stubborn makeup like mascara
it is not greasy at all
doesn't break my skin out
my face felt hella greasy
so when that's all washed away you know that all the sunscreen is gone
i felt like the sunscreen wasn't completely off my face
didn't want it to block my pores
most of the makeup removers will make me break out
the only downside is how messy the oil can get when you pump it as it can slip between your fingers
at first i was concerned because the word "oil" made me think it will clog my pores
it doesn't leave my skin super tight or oily/greasy
not too oily, great cleansing power
my cleanser never seemed to get off all my makeup
however not pleasant if gets into the eyes or mouth
i do feel the need to rinse my face with another cleanser afterwards because it does feel like a oily film is left on my face
i know this is doing it's job because i rarely see anything now on cotton pads i use for toner
it's so potent that i even use it to clean my makeup brushes
it softens my skin, but doesn't leave it oily.
this cleansing oil did not clog my pores or make me break out
since i don't wear foundation
never thinking that all that sunscreen might be clogging my pores
it's easy to use w/the pump
i can feel that it tights up my pores
this does cause your skin to appear more matte
would be perfect for those less oily than me because my skin is crazy oily so not much works with me
i found that if i applied it lightly
gently can even be applied over makeup which is awesome
i like that it's a treatment
not just some powder
this is the only moisturizer i have ever used that is not greasy
is never greasy or the least bit oily
does not cause pores / make me breakout
i found that when i wear this under my makeup my face is less oily throughout the day
it absorbs quickly and does not feel greasy.
i can't tell if this is anti-aging
doesn't dry me out like most products that are mattifying or clarifying do
one complaint--the bottle's pump is missing the inner plastic tube so the pump doesn't work
they made my face real oily
my face doesn't get oily anymore
t's product doesn't feel greasy at all
i only gave it 4 stars as it doesn't mattify my super oily skin all day
while i can't tell if the anti-aging part is working i do feel a slight tightening of my skin when i put it on
i knocked down one star because although it says the formula is noncomedogenic i noticed small bumps where i might have put on too much lotion
it's just not mattifying enough.
the shower get produces a light foam which is also an ideal medium for shaving my legs as it's not overly foamy
even people who generally don't like fragrances of any kind
not one pimple from this stuff
usually lotions will bring on zits to my t-zone-this is worth every penny plus
i always seem to wind up shiny
it is so hard to finid products that don't clog my pores or make me greasy
it doesn't feel greasy
my skin does look
everyone's skin is different
this product will not make you greasy keeps you oil free all day
my skin doesn't get oily
it's a great base before applying makeup
i usually didn't need to use pressed powder over foundation
i don't have to use the oil blotting sheets i typically carry around in my purse
've had a hard time finding a moisturizer that wouldn't clog my pores
however, oh-so-good for reducing shine!
that i've tried that actually control the oiliness in my t zone
my skin looks even
normally after a really long day my skin is shiny
made my pores seem to disappear
it really does keep my skin less oily
it is not comedogenic
even in dc humidity i don't need to do constant powder refreshing
it doesn't leave my face looking oily at the end of the day
i definately recommend it to someone trying to control oily skin
it doesn't coat your face or feel greasy or sticky at all
this product does not irritate my skin.
this is a great lite moisturizer that keeps most of the shine away
i find that this is the only facial moisturizer that really lives up to its claims as being non-sticky
i am not having to apply powder mid-day for my usually shiny t-zone
doens't have a bad odor
which is usually the problem for me on other moisturizers
it doesn't feel heavy and it's not oily.
tends to look dull at times
i don't have wrinkles yet
just melts into your skin
doesn't leave my skin shiny or greasy feeling
put it on your face it feels like it is menting in your skin
it doesn't irritate my skin
i've tried so many moisturizers that say that they improve your skin
plus it doesn't smell
don't have wrinkles to get rid of
it's very light and not too greasy.
velvety didn't actually feel heavy or oily when i applied it which is usually the case with those luxurious types of creams
only 4 stars because i don't like that it makes my skin more sensitive to the sun
i feel like sometimes it's too thick
it's a moisturizer that you will see an instant difference in how hydrated your skin will be
although some say it's too "tacky" or "sticky"
the end of a plastic spoon to dip it out because you don't need much
no icky feeling at all.
while nothing gets rid of the wrinkles
i don't need heavy coverage to have an even look
had resigned myself to using a moisturizer that didn't break out or irritate my skin
it's the one for me.
that just doesn't cut it for winter though
it actually doesn't feel the slightest bit greasy
found it too greasy
when i even think i'm starting to wrinkle
i read in a magazine somewhere that if you put moisturizer or serum on your skin while it's still damp
when it touches your skin
i recommend not to use it while you sleep
will definitely smoosh off into your pillow rather than do its job on your face
it doesn't leave my skin shiny
love that dewy look then i would recommend this
i get lots of compliments on my skin
without it i can't seem to keep whatever temporary moisture i find through drinking water or using great creams
it's not as light as hope in a jar.
light and smooth everywhere else.
my skin is even
don't expect huge results though- if you really want to get rid of some wrinkles you need acids
i can imagine it could be too rich for people with combination or oily skin
combination or even skin that tends to change during season like mine
the non-oily moisturizers just aren't doing the job any longer
i swear by this moisturizer because every time i see a little tiny bump surfacing on my skin
unlike hope in a jar
it doesn't have the offensive smell
it is not too greasy and smell is subtle.
it's a little heavy for me for daytime use
the person said my forehead doesn't wrinkle hardly at all when i talk or laugh lol
the bottle itself is so easy to use
it comes with this pump stopper so you can travel w/out making a mess
then i go in w/this oil cleanser to really remove all the makeup
when i lightly rub my face with this stuff i actually feel my makeup breaking apart
i realized i was never taking off all of my makeup w/simple wipes or cleansing water- i need this oil
i am not a fan of makeup wipes
i would always use 2-3 makeup wipes to remove my whole face
it does not sting my eyes
i wasn't even in the market for a makeup remover until i got a small sample of this stuff in the store
this didn't make me break out or cause any redness or dryness
never caused any skin problems like some other cleansing oil might
if you're curious, i have combination skin.
not the clean tight feeling more like omg baby soft skin for the entire day
will not irritate acne
this makeup remover oil literally takes off your makeup so good
i don't mind the smell of it
even your sensitive eye area won't mind it either :
there's no leftover makeup that comes off on a cotton ball with toner
it's "watery" because it is a "cleansing oil"
pros: oils didn't clog my pores or break out my super sensitive skin
added a layer of moisturecons: it's really expensive
does nothing against my mascara
when it comes to eye makeup...forget about it.
this stuff does work at removing all of you rest of your makeup if you are diligent
it also did wonders for taking off my mascara
its not irritating enough
doesn't burn my eyes at all
it does not burn my eyes nor does it irritate my skin
it wasn't harsh at all
it doesn't break out my super acne prone/ oily skin
i rushed home to try it oh wow it's awesome just melts your makeup away
as it does leave me a little too oily
i often wear "full cake" makeup.
this product always removes all of my makeup
t doesn't affect my lip skin in any way
this truly does remove all makeup from my face
or i get lazy because i wear a full face
the time it takes to take it all off is annoying
takes off everything, even my waterproof mascara.
it's like giving my face a cooling mask at the same time
cannot use oily products on my face otherwise i get really shiny- however
occasionally i just use the cleansing oil
no matter your skin type
this product gives me a great deep cleanse without bothering my skin
there is no need to scrub.
i don't feel dryness or any residue of my makeup- even water proof makeup
this cleansing oil is legit!!!
i cannot use most eye make up removers without it bothering my eyes
i don't mind oils at all
it doesn't irritate my eyes or sensitive skin
t doesn't leave a greasy oily feeling
it didn't leave my skin oily at all
i don't know how effective it is with waterproof makeup though
it's okay when i put my moisturizer on
worry about a lot of makeup removers causing my skin to breakout
i hated that i always had to rub my eyes with cotten balls of waterproof makeup remover just to not have mascara running down my face
if you get some in your eyes it doesn't sting just makes it a little cloudy- better than that soap in the eye feeling
it doesn't clog pores
i waned to find something that wasn't going to strip it raw every night
it's so quick to dissolve all my make up
every time they make my skin burn or my eyes except this one
after years of trying to find a make up remover that didn't irritate my eyes i found oil-based cleansers
viscous enough that it doesn't run through my fingers once i pump it into my h
the only thing i'm not in love with is the eucalyptus
it's too refreshing for my evening routine
doesn't leave any residue
does not irritate the skin
no need to wipe or scrub your face
i wear a lot of makeup
yet removes even my heavy duty waterproof mascara
it doesn't leave my skin feeling stripped
note: make sure to keep your eyes closed until the product is completely off your eyes otherwise your vision may appear slightly blurry
this is not painful or irritating
since i primarily use it for eye makeup i did notice that afterwards my eyeshadow wasn't lasting even with primer
acne prone skin so as i got older makeup wipes bugged the heck out of my skin
i do not use this for an all-over-face cleanser
it helps me with all my makeup even if it's waterproof
it takes off my makeup so easily
melts your makeup right off
it doesn't leave any gross greasy film on your skin
it removes all the makeup without feeling a dry squeaky clean that probably makes my skin produce more oil
it removes all me makeup even waterproof
f you're oily don't be afraid that it says oil
i don't love the feeling of oil on my skin
it didn't make my face oily or cause me to breakout
i usually follow it with a cream or foam cleanser to get the residual yucky stuff off
doesn't leave a weird film on my face
it also doesn't dry my skin out which i really like
they were either too greasy or made me break out
this one can be a little greasy when you first apply on your face
it's a quick one-step system.
even if she's too lazy to rinse it off
i can wear a heaping mess of makeup
this stuff will rub it right off without
t doesn't feel like i took the top layers of my skin off along with my makeup like a lot of other makeup removers do
it is not a soap
will not lather if you mix it with water like typical washes
it melts your makeup completely off without the feel of a heavy residue left on your skin
if i wear makeup that day or night i use this
this stuff will melt it all off
haha this is pricey for a make up remover
i do go in with some lancome make up oil cleanser for my eyes because i don't rub the boscia remover too much in my eyes
i always follow with another cleanser after to make sure i am squeaky clean
it's a nice oily consistency
hardly any leftover makeup is left on the pad
i loathe having to remove it
no matter what make-up remover i used in the past
it doesn't irritate my eyes or skin
it's so easy, plus it's gentle on your skin!
it doesn't irritate my eyes
you'll still see results
thankfully my hormonal acne hardly exists
it doesn't foam at all which i admit is kind of weird for a cleanser
this is definitely not a makeup removing cleanser
it doesn't take away everything-- i still get the odd pimple
it doesn't dry out my skin like almost every other acne cleanser i've tried
i do know that the non-drying formula means that my face won't overcompensate by producing more oils
the only products that even made a dent in the acne dried me out into a disgusting flaky mess
usually left some scars anyway
it does confuse me that it doesn't foam up like other facial cleansers do so sometimes i wonder if it's actually cleansing my face
really do recommend it to my oily acne prone friends out there
the 4 star rating was because of the pesky blackheads that this can't seem to budge at the corners of my nose
can't hold it to it :
if you're dealing with acne
other than that it's an amazing cleanser.
it's made such a difference for my skin
the thing i love about this product is that it doesn't dry out my face
is the only form of acne i get
even though it doesn't lather
it certainly dries up my breakouts
this cleanser is gentle enough even to use after those
this is a good cleanser soothin it will work even on dry skin non stripping however will not control oil or get rid of ur black heads maybe good for winter
i love that this cleanser doesn't foam up
i still have bad acne
not every cleanser is going to work for every skin type
i don't have any breakouts
do you have stubborn pimples that just won't go away?
hours after using this cleanser my face is not greasy
i break out pretty bad during pms
it's hard to say if it is only due to the cleanser as i have changed a few components of my routine
typically every skin product i use either breaks me out or dries me out
i've tried so many face washes
while a face wash alone can't overcome all the crazy hormonal acne
while it doesn't foam a ton
it foams enough to work well with my clarisonic
i find that it does lather
doesn't leave me feeling overly dry
the clinique stuff i was using was making my skin peel
it doesn't leave me feeling greasy
feel like it's fighting my acne all day
it does not foam up
haven't had any zits
it doesn't foam like others do it feels more like a gel
it does not foam
really helps with acne breakouts while not drying your skin out at all
though it does not foam or bubble at all
when i do get some small pimples i was my face at night
occasionally bad eating habits
if there is any con for this product it's that it's a little hard to get it to lather on
because it doesn't have that much salicylic acid
everyone's skin is different
gentle enough on the skin that you can use it every day
they made the acne worse or they made my skin peel so badly it literally would flake off
tried it because it wasn't supposed to dry out your skin
now i hardly need concealer.
i basically go make-up free except for lipstick.
i can say this may be the only cleanser i have tried that leaves my face feeling smooth
i know everyone's skin
now i only get the occasional hormonal breakout from time to time
you do not need a lot as it spreads because of it's texture
it wont remove your makeup so make sure you go in with something to remove your makeup off first
it doesn't really get foamy which i think it why it isn't so drying
i don't have to use a leave-on topical treatment anymore
it's not too drying and my skin looks great!
it does not make my face feel oily or too "weighed down"
this cleanser doesn't get foamy
it does a great job at clearing up all sorts of acne whether it's cystic
i however don't like the way it dispenses hard to see where it comes out
i can see some laugh line minimization
there must be some plumpers in it
not only do i have thin sagging skin
not so much in the puckering
i don't have many wrinkles/lines
i didn't see any changes with thin lines on my foreheard
it's a new product for me
i still don't use it underneath makeup
it tends to make me greasy
this is a light formula, not greasy.
it's perfect before my regular moisturizer.
i can't believe i spent that much on a skin cream
juvedrem too-thought would need more juvederm in nasal folds
don't expect miracles if you're skin is super-damaged by age
because the life cycle of a cell is usually 28-30 days up til usually age 30 or so
how are you going to see firming results if your skin is not sagging
never did it irritate or cause redness as some products have
i found it easy to apply makeup afterward
this did not irritate my sensitive skin or make it break out
doesn't make your face shiny
doenst make me extra oily
now if i could just get him to wear a decent sunscreen
it doesn't cause my skin any irritation
making it feel tacky
i love the packaging just because it's simple
not does make the oily spots worse
the only moisturizer that doesn't make my face oily
the pump doesn't reach the bottom of the bottle
t stops pumping wayyy before it's actually empty
i liked the fact that it's non comedogenic
my skin doesn't freak out when i apply it unlike other creams i've used in the past
it perfectly glides on without making me feel like my face is shiny or cracking
it's light weight and i use it all year round.
it doesn't show up oily on my skin
it's great for oily skin
it doesn't break me out or make my already red skin more irritated
my only real complaint is the packaging doesn't get all the lotion out
you can just use the pump straw thing
if it wasn't for fab i'd still be using drugstore products that irritate my skin
i can't us frugal products because the ingredients are so harsh
i don't think it's life changing
which my skin does normally
this moisturizer doesn't make me more oily
great for everyday use, will not leave skin oily.
it doesn't go on heavy or greasie
i do not wake up with oily face in the morning like i normally do
it's quite pricey for a small bottle
it's not too heavy or greasy
it doesn't irritate or clog my pores.
you might like that if you have oily skin
it's always a struggle to find products that keep the oil at bay
it didn't make my face oily
i don't have to do my makeup again throughout the day because my face doesn't get oily with this moisturizer
when i sleep with this moisturizer on i don't wake up with a completely oily face
it does not feel heavy after hours
hours you applied it to your skin
it does not make my face feel oily.
it tends to not get every single bits of it
doesn't leave my skin feeling sticky
does not leave the skin greasy
my t-zone was still getting oily pretty fast
doesn't leave a greasy look
doesn't irritate my skin at all
it's lightweight enough to wear during the day
i feel by using this in conjunction with cover fx mattifying primer that they control my oily skin during my long 10 hour days
it doesn't make me shiny at all
doesn't leave my face greasy either.
it absorbs really quickly so there is no greasy residue
i didn't wanna stray away from my trusty clinique gel moisturizer
it doesn't have any scent so
does not irritate my skin
it doesn't have spf
it doesn't brighten my skin
it doesn't really give me a glow
i cant use it during the day because it makes my skin much to oily throughout the day :
you don't have to wait to apply makeup
i like the fact that it doesn't have a fragrance
my t-zone doesn't get out of control greasy
it doesn't make my skin react, which is good.
does not make you oily
does not leave your face too greasy to put your makeup on
it does not make me oily at all
i would recommend this to anyone struggling to find a moisturizer that moisturizes their skin without making them oily or mattifying them to the point where they're too dry
i love this stuff because i don't have to dig my fingers in a jar
if you're trying to fix bad dark circles
hardly got any sleep
doesn't really get rid of the dark circles
as a result have developed puffy/baggy eyes that no amount of extra sleep seems to be able to cure
it doesn't appear to leave a film causing issues with foundation or powder
not sure if it's effective for puffiness though
i color correct my dark circles so that's the least of my worries
i can usually tell the difference between mornings when i use it
not greasy at all
it's so easy to use
don't really need eye cream
i don't really have puffiness issues either.
this doesn't cause those little white things to start poking out around my eyes
it's not too thick
i don't believe anything will change the natural shape of my eyes
i think this does seem to reduce the puffiness under my eyes
it's super easy to use
it doesn't feel so liquidy that it feels runny
i also use this on my upper lids which seems to eliminate puffiness there's well
use something more potent at night so you don't need to worry about your makeup applying well over it or it making your eyes water
i think it's a good moisturizer
it didn't smudge my makeup at all
it does not mess up my makeup
sucks that puffiness right out
i definitely would recommend this soothing serum to anyone who has big bags under their eyes
it's great to keep in the fridge to give it some more anti-puff boost
it got 4 stars because cool teabags would achieve the same result
you would of never known it thanks to this rollerball
it doesn't affect makeup application either.
my eyes aren't as dark anymore
before you'll see results
it will clog my pores a little bit
tacky feeling when i put it on
i don't wear make up
this heavy stuff + the lightweight moisturizer mixed together make it so that i don't have to rub too hard
it is one of the few products that don't irritate my skin
yet it lasts endlessly
you may get acne
use it to give you the smooth geisha face you see on film
it doesn't leave a oily skin feeling
this stuff is rich - make no mistake.
nothing settles into my fine lines anymore.
nose doesn't shine through like it used to
it's actually more of a lightweight gel
usually wrinkle fighting products don't work
considering that my complexion is kind of fickle
"youth-ify" my skin without making it too dry or too greasy like most other products
it certainly gets rid of dullness.
it does feel a little thick
possibly a little oily feeling for me
well my coworker asked if i had a peel or facial because my skin looked good
even though i get lots of peels and ipls.
i did have a peel 5 days ago so perhaps this was the icing on the cake
this product does not burn, sting or irritate.
i think if you have a problem with wrinkles
it stays kind-of greasy
i don't think it makes me breakout in my oilier areas
it definitely doesn't dry me out
it's just a little pricey for me
even though it's perfumed i have no negative reactions at all
everything makes me either break out or flake.
doesn't leave me feeling oily or greasy
i don't get oily and my makeup lasts all day.
to put it simple, it's a life changer.
this is perfect because it's not too heavy
doesn't break me out or feel too heavy.
yes it does leave your skin a touch oily
however it does leave my skin feeling a bit greasy
whenever i used a moisturizer it would irritate it even further
i never found any luck with any moisturizer
they're always either way too greasy or way too light
it isn't too greasy
ok so my derm prescribed me with tretnoin for my acne which gave me crazy peeling dry skin which i wondered was it worth it for no acne ?
i would rather pay that much for soft hydrated skin then get more lines because of the drying of my acne meds that i need
this comfort creme seems to do the trick
the smell is the first thing you notice when you use this moisturizer
it's refreshing and light, not too overpowering.
it's not at all greasy
let's not even get into the winter seasons.
even as a night cream
i don't feel greasy the next morning
i didn't really have oily skin to begin with
nothing keeps you plump
i love it so much it's now my daytime moisturizer as well
i don't have wrinkles yet
my skin does not feel greasy after application
does not clog pores
flaky even if i am mostly at home
not sticky at all
this new version doesn't smell as good as the hydraction which is the older version of this one w/o anti aging stuff in it
it's not too rich
i like that there is spf in it
it doesn't feel like you have spf on your face
unless they have a typo on the tubs?
it's really hard to get the last of it out with the oddly shaped narrow opening
i don't have any dark circles
i don't have dark circles
i wear under makeup or with no makeup.
for some reason i haven't gotten black heads or any type of blemish even tho this is all i'm using
it comes with an applicator so you don't use your fingers when applying
you don't need to use a lot of cream
does not help with dark circles or bags.
not too sticky after you use
my eyes just don't ache anymore
i don't have dark circles
can't attest to that aspect of it
don't use too much on each application or you'll waste it
i like it because it's a nice compromise between eye creams that are thick
it absorbs quickly too and doesn't feel greasy.
creme yet gel texture was perfect for me in the mornings because not only do i only need a tiny dab
even their version w spf does not pill up w makeup
can't necessarily reverse wrinkles
did not give me rash like other eye cremes
cant put it under my eye concealer or else it will start to get lumpy
since i'm only 19 i didn't need any anti-wrinkle stuff
it does not burn or irritate.
hydrates, but doesn't wreck your makeup.
not hydrating enough for me to use just this at night
the price be damned
darned if the skin around my eyes isn't clearer
didn't make my eyes water
you only need a dab.
i don't know about dark circles
occasionally i can even use this on my lips
my eyes do not have dark circles
the design of the jar is absoluletly stupid
does not burn my skin
the only downer is that the sunscreen is missing in this version
it does seem to reduce puffines around my eyes
it's like surgry in a bottle for me.
goes on so easily there's no worry of stretching the delicate eye area
the jar design does make it annoying to get at the cream towards the last 25% or so
it's a minor inconvience i'm willing to overlook for a good eye cream
the packaging is annoying, though.
because it's so thick
it won't leave a residue
i definitely wear less concealer around the eye area now
it's weird the way it's set up
if my eyes are the slightest bit puffy i just add some cream
never stings my eyes
does not feel sticky or thick
it also makes it alot easier to apply my under-eye concealer than my old eye cream did
only thing is the creams sort of stings my sensitive skin for a few seconds
the only negative remark i have is that it makes my skin a little sticky
because it doesn't seem to affect my makeup application or appearance
not too oily or heavy
i don't know if this eye cream is spf
the clogged pores actually seem to clear out better than exfoliating scrubs
this serum seemed to just even everything out.
do not apply after makeup as it can appear to "peel"
i didn't feel any dryness
although i feel like if you are combo/oily
it doesn't leave an oily residue after putting it on
it does have a lot of alcohol in it which is irritating to skin
i usually use it on day where i'm not wearing any makeup
i think it's because it's cleaning the skin
while it doesn't control oil
its really all you need after you cleanse.
this didn't work as well as visionnaire on pores
it seems to do nothing about my pores :
i would prefer not to pay this much for a glorified toner
noticed that my skin didn't feel oily by lunch
by the end of the day, i'm still not oily.
this stuff seems to eradicate this problem
said "your skin doesn't look oily at all"
every little bit helps when your pockets are shallow
as long as she doesn't smile haha
i don't even need to wear my moisturizer anymore.
everyone's skin is different
i can see a difference in the texture of my face without it
doesn't lasts too long
thought i would slather on some of this "potion" while i was doing my usual kid-in-a-c
i may buy that for the weekends when i don't wear air brush dior
just get a nice brush so you don't waste it.
even when i put a lot of this product on my eyes it didn't leave me with skin problems that come with other creams from over hydration
sometimes i go without makeup
even out my skin tone
don't wince about the price tag
i don't get oily as quick
if it comes in a jar or tube
scent is not a reason to buy a skin care product
i am not sure of the dark skin spots disappearing
at age 30 i started to get bad acne.
i know it's pricey
blowing money on products that i can't use
t's kinda hard to make a judgment for the anti-aging part
thick lather that it ends up lasting a lot longer than any other cleansing foam i've ever used
i gave it 4 stars only because i don't like to feel tackiness on my skin
it's not horribly tacky it's just enough for me to feel it
we will spend the money we shouldn't to get a little natural glow
is not at all greasy
did not notice any change except for the anti-pimple feature of the product
does not make my combination skin oily
it doesn't smell as bad the cold plasma sub-d
t sits well under my makeup too
if i keep it on too long it seeps in my eyes
this way that awful smell doesn't linger
to the people saying this smells nasty/like fish/like "sewage": you may want to take your jar back because you must have a bad batch
i love this eye cream it makes your eyelid look oh so smooth
i want something good to prolong the aging for the skin around my eyes
i rarely stick with a product
hadn't realized it can be used on eye lids
and yes it smells like metal, but i don't mind.
and the smell doesn't fade!
this stuff does have an unpleasant smell
this cream was light enough to use on my eye lids without causing them to break out in a rash or feel greasy
it only smells when you are putting it on
once it's on your eyes it doesn't have a smell
this pst winter it seem like creams weren't doing a thing
as i cannot tolerate bad smells
it doesn't feel heavy
its a strange almost tacky consistency that doesn't soak right into the skin
if cp makes you gag this will too
all you do is lightly touch the tip of your finger to the cream
if you want something to tame your dark circles
i love that i can put it on my eye lids.
i can't put on concealer without it.
washing can't smell it at all
this eye cream doees everythhing i want it too
the smell is not that bad and goes away fast.
you shouldn't be slathering this product on under your eyes
i do follow it with a light moisturizer that may help mask the smell
know i cant get rid of wrinkles i already have
the only thing is the smell.
i can't even smell it ---
some people cannot tolerate the smell
doesn't care if you smell like a dead fish
it doesn't smell like fish to me
i couldn't smell it any more
i just don't know if it's that much better than just using the regular cold plasma for the face around the eyes
but you still do need a moisturizer.
it can make the skin look a little dewey
i don't notice this issue under makeup.
a lot of reviewers are claiming that this is either too greasy or heavy
you must protect your skin with that spf.
i don't think it's oily like some people describe it here
i don't feel the spf is greasy at all
not sticky, feels great on and i don't spf cream.
i wear alone without makeup
have a hard time finding moisturizers that will not irritate my skin
have repurchased because i need the intense moisture that the red fab lotion didn't give me
doesn't ball up like some
not have to worry about damaging my skin
this is one of the only moisturizers i've found that works for me without irritating my face
doesn't make my skin too oily
it also doesn't burn when you apply it like some lotions with spf have done to me in the past
it's hard to find an spf over 15 that doesn't feel heavy
kinda greasy, but i don't use much of it.
a little squeeze on your index finger is enough to cover your whole face
don't have to look sticky all day to get the moisture i need
it doesn't exacerbate that
thanks to that i usually get an ugly red rash on my face
t probably is too heavy for people with oilier skin
this one does all that without feeling super heavy
my face never feels oily any more.
either my face was to oily or i'd end up with horrible breakouts
my face never feels too oily
it's thicker than i'd prefer
it doesn't aggravate my skin or cause breakouts
it's a little too greasy
the smell does not linger throughout the day so that is good
doesn't leave my face looking greasy
doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy
on days when i'm feeling lazy
even out my skin tone
doesn't make my skin oily
i do wear this under primer
for my skin type
when i put on just the right amount it doesn't make my oily areas even more oily looking
it does not irritate or make the skin break out at all
it is not greasy
my usual moisturizers weren't cutting it
the spf doesn't get in my eyes
this doesn't break me out and it has spf 30.
it does everything a moisturizer should have except cook you dinner
it's not greasy and it absorbs quickly.
you will get a little shiny by the end of the day
doesn't dry out your skin like some others do
the 5 in 1 face cream is so light that it doesn't feel like sunblock
i got a sample to make sure it wouldn't explode my face with breakouts
it's just the right weight
i love the fact that it doesn't feel like there is a sunscreen in it
'm not so shiny
it's not greasy at all!
i don't get coarse skin from sunshine like i do if i wear less sunblock
i can still use my sheer transformation by ole henriksen over this moisturizer
never leaves me greasy
i like that it doesn't feel like spf on my skin
i like that i can combine moisturizer with high enough spf in one
love this product, not heavy at all.
people with acne-prone skin have no excuse for not using a moisturizer
it's great at night to keep my skin free of blemishes without clogging pores
the moisturizer only peels off when you do not rub it in properly
it's not sticky absorbs quick
not greasy, absorbs easily and is not too watery.
it moisturizes while not causing me to break out like most other products
doesn't clog my pores or make my skin greasy
giving 4 because i don't care for the scent of this product
i wouldn't recommend boscia's lotion for people with dry skin types because the formula wouldn't give them enough hydration
but it does miracles to oily, combination types!
i do get pimples often enough for me to be frustrated with their constant appearance
still seem to have lots of this moisturizer left
at least it's not full of a bunch of fragrances
t isn't too rich for my oily/combination/acne prone skin
it's helped with the acne i have
it does not clog my pores
don't get many breakouts
i can wear this under makeup
i recommend this moisturizer simply because it doesn't feel heavy on my face
does not clog my pores
it's the only lotion i've tried that i feel like controls my oily yet maturing skin
this one does not leave my skin oily
heater combination really seems to attack my skin
when it's not so cold out it's fabulous.
i usually like to get in
didn't make me oily
while i think it's a good moisturizer with no obvious smell
it's really not for my oily skin
it feels a little filmy on my skin when i wash it off
it's not pleasant either
if i didn't rinse it off thoroughly enough my skin started to feel a little itchy after drying
just make sure to not use the recommended full one pump or you'll have to drown your face in the sink like me :d
i don't get those huge pimples anymore.
it's the only cleanser i've ever used that hasn't stripped my skin
doesn't leave my skin feeling tight
i still get the occasional break out
usually my fault for not taking off my makeup
yet gentle enough that my skin never feels stripped
if you use it in the pm you'll have to double cleanse
is soothing when i do get a breakout
i do first use some type of makeup remover
i feel as if it doesn't remove all of my makeup
if you're battling acne
as bad as sleeping in your makeup
not in that bad squeaky clean way
it's done miracles to my jawline
while my pimples are shrinking my skin is so silly smooth
i love that it doesn't have harmful chemicals in it
my cleanser just wasnt cutting it anymore
t doesn't foam like most face washes
it is a great non foaming cleanser that doesn't dry out your skin
you can feel the clay removing the oil from your face
i can't say it eliminated all my acne
i would recommend this product to anyone who's looking to get rid of acne without drying out their face
my skin is very acne prone-i have always had a pimple or clusters of pimples of some sort on my face since i was 16
so it's safe to say i'm a huge product junkie.
this cleanser acted soooo quickly in helping stop my breakouts
i liked the fact it didn't completely strip my skin of all moisture
this is the only cleanser you'll need
as it does not lather it is completely devoid of sulphates
the scent doesn't stick around
doesn't leave any residue
it's free of everything i tend to avoid
i don't find it helps much with the prevention of acne
am usually afraid to try clay cleansers or masks
its well on it's way
i've never used a clay cleanser before so there is no lather
as such does not foam up
at first it feels like it's not cleaning anything because the texture is a bit oily
it doesn't lather up
your skin feels like ph restored as apposed to when using other cleaners it makes your skin feel dried out
if it bugs you i never seem to notice it after my shower
it's been an amazing cleanser for the rest of my face
it's still my go to whenever my skin starts to misbehave
can still use this cleanser no problem
this is my favorite ren cleanser- it doesn't really have much of a smell
people say that this cleanser leaves a "film"
i just think they are not used to the fact that this cleanser doesn't strip your skin of its essential moisture so feels like there it still stuff on your skin
it doesn't sting the eyes
or else the clay turns too milky
sometimes my skin can be red in some reasons where i break out
there's no redness when i wake up
trying to find something to combat acne on my 20-something skin
even helps remove my eye makeup
i get compliments on my skin often
i don't recommend to use this if you are suffering from acne-prone skin
i find that it doesn't strip the skin at all
does not irritate my skin
doesn't strip my skin
while it does have that 'clay' smell
i find that this cleanser gets rid of any oil that i have
under my makeup you could still see blemishes.
it's smooth and even brighter.
i don't wear makeup some days because of the improvement in my skin
there are a lot of women stating that it leaves a film on your face or it doesn't take off your makeup
immediately after washing your face you might feel some of the cleanser still on your skin
as for the cleansers ability to remove makeup-- i didn't read anywhere on the bottle that this product was a makeup remover
i think it is quite obvious that one should remove all of their makeup before washing their delicate skin
otherwise you're just smearing makeup
i'd like to think it's helping my acne.
cleans the way it's supposed to
i can't use tons of harsh chemicals
yet the pump doesn't dispense anything
it doesn't leave your skin feeling squeaky clean or stripped
doesn't linger once you rinse
you know that squeaky-wayy-too-clean feeling?
it does not irritate my skin nor does it cause my skin to become dryer
i never used to bother washing my face
caudalie didn't seem to get my skin clean
cons: won't remove all of your makeup
it doesn't dry my combo skin out
other cleansers always either dried out my skin horribly or were so greasy that i'd break out worse
it is not rough or irritating to my skin
now i only have the occasional pimple
i guess it was just pulling all the gunk out
this is not a makeup remover by any means
i finally feel comfortable enough to only wear lip gloss
it is not greasy at all
i don't get any acne on my cheeks anymore
it does make me a bit oily
since it's oil free
it doesn't do much for my acne
you often get those chunks of lotion
if you do an entire pump you will be rubbing it into your face for quite some time
it'll just get extra smooth
acne this is right for you
t listed some chemicals it doesn't contain
i can agree that it's not enough moisture sometimes
i just use a gentle cream when it's not enough
doesn't leave my face greasy
i don't even use a full pump otherwise i'm sitting there rubbing my face forever just to get it rubbed in
it doesn't leave my skin feeling oily or greasy
it doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy at all
flaky skin if i don't -- this moisturizer has changed the game for me
my skin is not greasy at all
doesn't cause break outs by end of day
whenever i get zits the worst side effect for me is how red they get
literally no makeup can cover them.
it's a little tricky in applying
if you suffer from zit inflammation you're going to really like this product
it's good to use before makeup
still get occasional breakouts while using it
more importantly this didn't clog my pores or make me breakout at all
so much so that i can't really wear makeup because it making the flaking even more obvious
this one does hydrate my skin well enough to allow me to tolerate my acne treatment
it's too soon to tell if it will help with my acne scars
does not add greasy feel or shiny look to skin
it might not be quite thick enough as a pm moisturizer to deal with the flaking
it does not leave residue or greasiness
if you are acne-prone
i love that just the tiniest little bit will cover practically your whole face
you don't waste any product
i've had so much trouble finding a moisturizer that wasn't greasy for my oily skin
didn't clog my pores
i didn't need to use a skin cream
voila - i have combination skin.
yet does actually moisturize
won't do too much to cure acne
will not irritated acne if you have it
have a hard time finding a moisturizer that isn't a
i'll probably move on to find something a little more hydrating like the vita line
it doesn't help improve acne
it didn't make me oily
while this doesn't provide a lot of moisture
existing stubborn pimples have either reduced in size or have gotten to the point where i can pop them
i love it as a day cream under my makeup
it's very calming and doesn't cause breakouts.
as it isn`t a good enough moisturizer on its own
i can't tell if it's done anything to help decrease pigment
can be used instead of a moisturizer if you get oily skin during the night
even when i have no breakouts i still use it as it leaves my skin smooth
i couldn't find a single moisturizer that didn't make my skin burn
this product does nothing to actually treat or prevent acne
even my skin tone
it's better than my personal skin doctor
i'll probably add another ren moisturizer in the winter though
i really love this one only because after i cleanse with the ren clay cleanser my face feels really oil free
i almost didn't want to moisturize
sometimes in the morning
usually everything i put on feels like it's burning
doesn't clog my pores
it's not too heavy, it doesn't feel greasy.
my usual skin care routine just couldn't keep everything under control
this really helps give it a nice boost to keep away any flakiness that might occur with acne treatments
it's not too heavy
it's amazing because it doesn't dry out my skin
i don't know if i would agree with the comments that redness from scars goes away over night or if this actually prevents acne
adding a little extra of ren to the pimples
i like how it takes my blackheads out
try it out for yourself first to see if it drys your skin out completely or not
it didn't take out as much pore gunk as i thought
you're not going to witness with this mask what you've probably witnessed online through videos that show these black masks peeling off large pieces of nose gunk
out of your skin when you peel of this black mask is soooo satisfying
otherwise it'll be a pain to pull off
it's an intense mask that you must apply a thick layer to work properly
grime come out of my pores makes this mask "worth it" to me
my suggestion is to make sure to put a thick
it's hard to peel if it's too thin.
it's hard to give it all 5 stars
my boyfriend was disappointed that it didn't have the effects of peel off masks that appear to rip out all white
or it hurts to peel off
easy to apply plus it doesn't hurt at all when you remove it
it didn't exactly remove all the white heads from the nose
the mask is not like the masks they show on social media where it's painful to take them off
so, let's start with the pro's.
i shouldn't be using masks like this
this product did not irritate or flush my skin
it also doesn't hurt the skin when you peel it off
if you want to have to have any blackheads pulled out
this mask is a waste of your time
so the trick for me is to creat a thick layer
even though i didn't put on an "opaque" layer as the directions told me to
though i did have to rub at the areas of my face that had a particularly thin layer of product in order to get it to peel off
the gel is soothing and doesn't burn my eyes.
this is not the cheap chemical base junk from instagram where you see girls crying
this is not one of those masks that pulls out all of your blackheads
it does pull some fine hairs off of your face if you use it on cheeks
you can't expect something to pull your dirt
it doesn't pull baby hairs like a lot of peel masks do
don't write it off completely before trying the baking soda
it doesn't pull out blackheads like some of the other peel off masks you see online
those ones are like putting super-glue on your face
it does hurt in some areas to peel off lol
feel like there's always that extra dead skin layer
i really like this product because it doesn't irritate my skin
it doesn't hurt to peel off like the online videos show
this makes it easy to see where you've applied it
it's just like the videos
this is also great if you want to remove some of that crazy peach fuzz
it won't get all the peach fuzz and that's ok.
it doesn't take out blackheads like it promises
especially if you have a lot of blackheads on your nose like i do
does not make my skin look oily
cannot go wrong with this black mask.
it literally gets all the junk out if my skin
sometimes with peel off masks it's hard to get the right amount on your face
however, it did not remove any blackheads.
i don't have a lot of blackheads as is
otherwise this is a good mask
for oily skin it didn't make me oily at all in my t zone or greasy so thats a plus
it does help my skin
the reason it's not 5 star is the fragrance was too strong even if it's natural fragrance
doesn't over hydrate so you can wear under makeup or as a night cream
i would recommend using a little bit of eye primer with it bc it can make your concealer crease a little bit
does not leave an oily feel
can't believe it's for every skin type????
it is one of the only moisturizers you will find that doesn’t feel like it is just setting ontop of your face
i wasn't super shiny within a couple of hours
i do find it to be a tad bit oily
it performs great under makeup because it doesn't get greasy
the finish is not too shiny once applied
even though the smell is not unpleasant
it has a good texture where it's not too thick or too thin
it isn't greasy at all
doesn't leave skin looking shiny
it doesn't smell bad at all
it doesn't burn when applying under your eyes.
my only dislike is that it seems to make my skin feel dry when combined with bb cream that also has spf
i do a clarisonic cleaning so everything just soaks in
it doesn't leave you feeling greasy
love that it isn't greasy or heavy
doesn't feel greasy/heavy
i never used it as i have acne prone skin
really don't break from my routine in fear of breakouts
the smell isn't as bad as some claim
not liquid, but not a super heavy cream, either.
a moisturizer that doesn't feel like i've got concrete on my face
this super creme is light enough to wear under makeup
in his words, "it's guy approved."
totally addicted to rich moisturizer without being heavy or greasy
it is rich so maybe not for oily skin?
normally i don't like spf products bc i always feel like they leave an annoying residue behind
if i just use just the cleanser
hadn't found anything particularly special to me until i picked up the ole sample kit
isn't greasy at all
trying to find a face lotion that did well with my combination skin
i tried the sheer transformation moisturizer that came in the 3 little wonders package
i didn't find it hydrating enough
that's just for makeup lasting power
there is no greasiness to it
stay away from spf creams just because i hate the texture
so nice to have a sunscreen that is not goofy or greasy
i like a day cream with spf since my foundation doesn't have it
it's not greasy at all
there's a bit of a citrus scent going on
make sure you know how your skin reacts before shelling out the bucks
it doesn't leave your face feeling heavy or greasy
it just melts in
don't let the spf's white film fool you
this one makes my skin *tingle*
this is the only one i can slather on with no worries of break outs
can't go wring in my book
does not leave your skin feeling greasy.
a day creme with a respectable amount of spf that doesn't
i don't use it often
tend to get oily in the t-zone as the day goes on
my skin tends to break out
so many times i can only spot treat with stuff like that because it makes my sensitive skin break out
it still doesn't feel heavy on my face
with this product you don't even know you have sun block on
doesn't irritate my skin while it provides just the right amount of moisture
doesn't leave any residue
doesn't leave any residue or smell behind after applying
my makeup doesn't crease as much
not at all greasy
i would say it evens out my skin tone
it is not advertised to get rid of dark spots.
no nauseating smell that stays on your skin either
it has a tendency to pill up if you apply even the slightest bit of make-up
can't say that it has reduced wrinkles
not making me too shiny- im sure it also has anti wrinkle effects
this may sound silly
can't find anything for pores that works
it's not a moisturizer either.
if you use it on your eye lids they can get too swollen
it doesn't on the deep ones.
i don't really have any wrinkles
7oz bottles now at this point so this isn't a "impatient" review as some of my others can be lol
help me get a better line when i use my eyeliner
this product does not irritate my skin at all
not oily and only takes a little.
great results, doesn't irritate skin.
i don't have many wrinkles
as i can't speak for diminishing wrinkles
don't buy if you think your wrinkles will disappear
you'll see and feel the difference.
does not cause any weirdness when covered with a moisturizer
it doesn't do much for dark spots or sun spots
love that it's easy
the consistency is not greasy or gross
"your skin is so glowy" "your skin looks so healthy" "what did you do to your face?"
why it's helping my breakouts
small lines on my forehead were hardly there anymore
do add a certain something to your skin care regimen
just moisturizing doesn't seem to be enough anymore
doesn't leave skin greasy
remember to wear an spf with this product or you might cause more damage
it does seem to help with fine lines
it leaves skin soft without feeling like somthing is pulling your skin
this isn't one of those eye creams you can just dab or wipe on right out of the bottle
do not use it before makeup because it is a rich formula
feels like it's made from all natural ingredients
this cream doesn't seem good for oily skin.
however, it doesn't pull at my skin at all.
it's very hard to apply it because it has a thick shea cream type consistency
plus the cream is so thick i only need a fraction of what i'd normally use
f you are in a hurry to apply eye makeup you'll need to wait
doesn't clog my pores
expect it to absorb ---that's when it's greasy looking
doe not irritate or make my eyes blurring
does not irritate and no scent.
it's so thick you really don't need much
it's a paste-like cream
i cannot say that it really helps my under eye wrinkles
i know there's reviews that say this product is fairly greasy
not the least bit irritating
because it is a thick paste you think you are applying less with this method than you actually are
i didn't find that it helped with puffiness under my eyes
even though it's on the pricey side
don't know how it's lite enough for morning
doesn't leave me shiny
thin enough to feel it sink in your skin
but once i apply it, its not oily at all.
this has changed my mind on giving products a try when they are not as popular or colorful or has the "gold flakes" this stuff works
nor did it make my skin too oily
i can handle oily, but i can't handle dry.
i can still feel the moisture when i press into my skin
it didn't clog my pores or break me out
this doesn't really have a scent.
a faint one but it doesn't linger.
doesn't mess with my foundation
if i don't apply anything to my face it does get shiny
doesn't cause break outs with her
it is not greasy at all
the biggest perk of this moisturizer for me is that it doesn't feel too slick or unnatural
too bad it's tooooooo expensive .
not only does this product hydrate
it doesn't leave my skin greasy
i would say it smells similar to eucerin lotion.
scaly patch on my face that i just couldn't get rid of
doesn't feel like your wearing it
it doesn't effect my makeup during the day as long as i use the invisablur with it
normally i don't give a product five stars
big bonus if i can use it for eye cream too
i tend to be a product junky
it still doesn't feel heavy
i love that it didn't leave my face greasy
because it's so pricey
say if makes you face greasy
let it sit around for a week or two because i am pretty scared of moisturizers since my pores are easily clogged
it makes my makeup go on sort of chunky
this is one of few products i've found that doesn't cause irritation
i layer my skin with it sometimes even 3 times a day
it's simply going to moisturize
also doesn't make my skin breakout.
it's perfectly fine under makeup
it's usually difficult for me to find a moisturizer that works for me because i have combination skin that breaks out easily
it's also not heavy enough that i apply it under makeup
my skin has a tendency to break out
there is no spf though
in the summer i tend to be more oily
although i really have to blot to make sure i don't look like a grease ball
it's not super rich
it doesn't completely absorb into skin either
i like that it doesn't pill
searching for a moisturizer that didn't make me break out
my acne wasn't as bad as when i was a teenager
doesn't feel sticky or oily
i would say my skin is average- not too oily
texture of this cream is exactly right
it doesn't irritate my skin
doesn't make your skin feel oily
because of that i get breakouts
i don't get any more flakes
as close as giving your skin a long cool drink of water as you'll ever get
it doesn't have spf
it's so light weight
i like to use it as my second cleansing step because it's so milky
doesn't irritate my skin
its so gentle i can use around my eyes.
it's not too thick or too thin.
gentle cleaner is just the thing anytime
most days i don't even apply a moisturizer afterwards
it is easy to grab
it didn't irritate my skin.
because it is so gentle that i doubt if it's doing the cleansing thing
i just can't seem to stay away from this cleanser
i can't believe my skin has cleared up
doesn't leave a filmy residue if it gets on your eyes a little
know i'm not putting any unnecessary chemicals on my face
although it doesn't foam up like i am used to
i wear a lot of makeup
even though it seems like the product is absorbed into the skin before you can even clean it
you just have to trust that there is still product on your skin when cleansing it
i think people are being silly when they expect a cleanser like this to completely remove makerup
it lasts along time takes off even waterproof mascara easily
something that doesn't cater to trends mostly in makeup artistry
this is the only moisturizer i've found that doesn't leave your skin looking greasy
it doesn't make my t-zone more oily
now i have prescriptions this does not moisturize enough
my face doesn't feel greasy afterwards
the jar it comes in actually holds a lot of product
i will say that i still get little pimples on my chin around my period
it's starting to get warm in sd so we'll see if i'll get versatility with this or will have to switch for the summer
not only with non greasy skin
if you're investing in the bobbi brown makeup
my skin would be flakey under my makeup
acne prone this is the perfect moisturizer it doesn't leave u feeling oily or feels heavy on the skin after i wash my face no matter how much lotion i put my skin feels tight
the only bad thing about it that i see is that it makes my blemishes extra red when i put it on
i wear it without any makeup
never oily at all, which is just amazing.
not too heavy with moisturizer
or make me look waaaayy greasy when i applied makeup
doesn't feel like it's clogging your pores
it's light feeling after applied
that's basically my daily regimen.
i wear it under makeup.
i don't feel that it leaves a greasy feeling
some people complain about the smell
it's got a light smell
it doesn't have spf
or i at least don't have to wear a primer over it
which i can never get rid of no matter how much i moisturize
i hate that because then your makeup just looks nasty
prior to using it i could never find anything that would keep my face moisturized without being greasy
i don't want to weigh my skin down with moisutuizer plus a primer
it doesn't clog my pores
does not cake up on the skin like thick creams often do
moisturized yet you do not feel any gunk/film/sticky ickiness on your face
it is never greasy
it's not too thick, too thin.
i've never really loved any daytime moisturizers
some left my skin too greasy
my combination skin would become far too shiny after i applied my makeup
i usually do not apply any make up cover ups
absorbs very quickly, doesn't leave oily film.
even though it's a cream
it can be used on its' own or layered underneath your usually spf lotion for more hydration
i just have to find the right combination to layer
my makeup has been looking rather flakey
it's not going to cure your lines or circles.
it naturally brightens the skin- even when you don't wear concealer on top
eye cream you can imagine from $20-$100+
the bags are controlled when i didn't get enough sleep
it does not appear greasy or have an oily finish
it is $$ however it can last you forever because the puniest amount does wonders for your eyes
no youthfulness at all anymore
a 52$ eye cream just doesn't sit well with me
no make up days without all that extra stuff that comes with many other eye creams
not too heavy or greasy!
doesn't give me milia
i couldn't even apply makeup under
it is absolutely true that you need to change your eye cream as you age--in my mid 20s this provides preventative hydration without all the extra "stuff" i don't need yet
don't need anti aging just yet
they're not just in the corner of my eye
it did not make my under eyes feel so oily like some
i got a terrible food related allergic reaction
it is the only eye cream that will get rid of the dryness completely
i didn't use anything beneath my eyes besides my daily face lotion
i keep it in my refrigerator for when i use it so that it's cold
i usually don't have a ton of time in the morning
too bad it's so pricey though
this one you can feel the absorption
i could not find a concealer that wouldn't flake or crease up under my eyes
this eye cream is not a gimmick
it's great to condition your ocular bone with this about 10 minutes before you put on your concealer as i find that it doesn't cause my makeup to slip
does not cause my mascara to smear onto my undereye area as the day goes on
it's pricey but it works.
this doesn't sting or burn
doesn't irritate my skin
doesn't irritate my eyes at all
this is the only eye cream that doesn't burn
it doesn't feel heavy or greasy
some eye creams leave me feeling like i have something tacky or sticky sitting on top of my skin
it's great if you need extra hydration
it's an easy step
it's the only eye cream that doesn't cause puffy under eyes
i simply love bobbi brown products
can become flaky if i dont take care of them
this doesn't have any anti aging properties
thick, rich creme that doesn't feel heavy.
gives your skin a squeaky clean feel without over stripping it
just know that one tube can easily last a year because you only need a tiny dot
you'll want to use a moisturizer after
except maybe change the moisturizer
not with this cleanser, my makeup is off.
does not take my waterproof liner offhowever i love josie cleansing oil for that
it can product a lot of bubbles which i like a lot
this tube soap is the facial cleanser that i use when i’m in the shower because of the convenient tube dispenser that sits upside down so that the cleanser is always ready to come out
since i use it in the shower i seldom take my clarisonic brush in the shower with me
i don't find the dropper to be that awkward
i really like the dropper dispenser.
my skin is usually a little oily/combination type
this stuff keeps my skin moisturized yet doesn't break me out
this stuff also helps fade my acne marks
it does feel tacky
my skin doesn't look dull at all now.
this product doesn't have any scent to it.
only a couple of little zits
you need to know that this does not have a sunscreen in it
1 1/2 pumps is all you need to cover your face
the less actual moisturizer you're getting
doesn't feel heavy or sticky
does not contain spf
have always struggled to find a lotion that didn't make my oily skin oilier
this doesn't add any shine to my tzone
doesn't make me greasy.
because i like a primer with my makeup
doesn't make me greasy
doesn't add any excess oil to my oily areas
you can't tell that this is oil-free
i don’t leave my house without a sunscreen on my face so even on days when i don’t feel like wearing makeup
it absorbs so completely that nobody can tell that i’ve got the lotion on
i would highly recommend that everyone use a sunscreen because i just had a tiny spot removed from my face
i really like this moisturizer!it's oil-free.
or they are useless
it doesn't leave your face feeling oily.
it does sink into the skin
getting a sample of this or at least smell the light fragrance it has to make sure you love it
i don't trust a lot of skin products
bobbi brown never fails to impress me!
it's so light weight and smells so good!
it's done wonders on calming my breakouts
yes i do get a bit shiny after a couple of hours
i think its great if you like to use your powders
there's a primer for everything
this stuff kept my makeup matte
by that it makes some type of layer inbetween your skin
doesn't leave a greasy feeling
you can use this alone as a makeup primer
this stuff is a miracle in a jar.
this does not irritate my skin
not greasy at all.
it doesn't leave me oily at all
it's light yet still hydrating without leaving a residue
so good if you have oily/combination skin
this stuff is honestly so amazing -- you can use it for light to no makeup days mixed with a little bb cream or some concealer
have never been able to consistently use a moisturizer without breaking out or feeling like my skin can't breathe
i don't use it as a primer
this makes your face so smooth
the only thing i dislike is the smell.
it isn't too bad
this cream is not for every skin type
was worried it wouldent work for me since it's intended for oily or combo skin
makes you're skin feel oh so soft
leaves my skin a little too shiny to be a primer
it's like my skin just drank a gallon of water
someone with very oily skin this is a ride or die piece in my collection for sure
acne scars recover like nothing else
it's somehow always dry
makes skin appear even without it
would definitely recommend it for those with uneven skin tones or if you want a dewy finish when applying makeup
there's nothing better you can for your face pre-makeup than applying this to your face
i noticed that when i put this on before my concealer it didn't crease as much
it is rich but not greasy or heavy.
it's just right for my skin tone!
my make up doesnt flake anymore with this used as my base
i usually hate a primer.
they're either greasy or thick or hard to rub in.
the jar lasts forever, too!
i love and it doesn't feel heavy!
even with my combo skin it really helped my makeup blend
this product will make you look more oily
i don't normally spend this kind of money on any beauty products
it doesn't create that chalky feeling that makes foundation go on smoothly
it's like a night cream as a primer
i really recommend this to anybody with oily or combination skin
a little goes a long way i use a clean beauty blender to put it on
at first i was afraid to use this for my combo/oily skin
it seemed to control my oils ok
my makeup lasts all day
be careful if your skin is prone to break-outs
it applies beautifully to the skin- you can barely feel it when you're wearing it
not greasy at all
this product does not make your face oily or greasy
it's like a deep conditioner for your face haha.
it doesn't smell bad in my opinion though.
it smells weird, but the smell doesn't last long.
this is what this face oil smells like.
does seem to sit on the skin
as i usually just use what is in the lid
it does feel a bit oily on topthe skin for just a bit
when i put this product my skin never get pimples
i don't even have to use my regular moisturizer afterwards
it doesn't seem to clog pores, is absorbed well.
i also dont look like freddy kruger anymore in the wintertime from my skin peeling
coconut oil break my face out so bad
you think oil=breakouts
'm not as red from breakouts
i can't seem to turn off the heater
only made it really shiny
you'll see the difference in the morning.
also you'll love the way it smells.
it would work better either in a spray bottle or even a bottle with an eye dropper
it does go on without feeling heavy.
you can use it on combo skin
try a little on a pimple too because it soothes the skin :-
and don't forget your neck and hands!
the only downer is the cap
i wish bobbi brown would put a stopper on the bottle for easier
without greasy feel despite its being an oil
it does not make your skin oily
although it seems counterintuitive to put oil on your face
it doesn't make your skin look greasy or oily.
acne-prone my skin was just not suited for this face oil
i noticed after about a week after she started using it that her usually flaky skin was no longer flaky at all
it's not irritating at all
this cream doesn't irritate them
if you get white film
i usually use a lot of eye cream
that it just melts into you like
miserable for someone that's not supposed to look worn
you don't need to use a lot of this eye cream
rich- if that isn't your thing
it doesn't melt or drip or disappear or weep
it is the only eye cream that i have ever used that didn't give me milia or tiny bumps everywhere
yes it's a little pricey
i can easily wear it under my concealer during the day
however i’m not sure anything could help my purple/blue circles from allergies aside from a good concealer
you do have to let it sink in before applying makeup
her eye cream doesn't compare to this one
as rich an eye cream as any out there in the dept
those pesky little lines
it's so rich that you only need a little bit-so this jar lasts forever
the cream doesn't do anything for dark circles however
i can't say that the wrinkles under my eyes have disappeared
make sure you dab under your eyes
don't rub or try to smooth
you need to warm it between your fingers- it will easier apply
when you're applying it
it does irritate it
does nothing for dark circles
it is not greasy
try it ... you'll like it!
this eye cream did not irritate my eyes or make the skin underneath the least bit red
this stuff is literal magic.
my pores are borderline gone
i don't know what makes this potion work
it's like the hack if your mascara drys up quick use contact lens cleaner cause it doesn't mess with the chemical compound
as the product will get crusty if you use to much in one spot
you could probably even skip the airbrush part
ladies go grab yourself a bottle its the best thing you can do for yourself
it really does make your wrinkles disappear
if you need to blot with water
lastly make sure it dries for about 10 minutes then apply makeup etc
i find if i use too much or dont rub it in i will have residue
however it tells you on the product that if there is a white residue or film to use water to remove it
i don't have a lot of wrinkles or eye bags
i will be irritated all day long for those pores
that mostly isn't a problem for me
it doesn't seem to affect the instant firmx
someone asked me if i had botoxed
if it gets in your eyebrows
put moisturizer everywhere else except where you apply this lotion
can't put on too much because then you have a white chalky look where you put it on
don't let your moisturizer touch it because it will make the white buildup increase
thin skin have left my face looking a little scary
if you put on too much you will have a white film on your skin
it does make your wrinkles go away
so you won't have the white residue
the only reason this doesn't get five stars is for the white residue when it dries
if i touch it with anything liquid the bags return
the other brand turned flakey and never lasted.
so that i don't actually need to pack on a moisturizer after
it's sad to say that because sometimes it's dry
there's nothing bad for your skin here
this product doesn't cause any irritation at all.
it doesn't make wrinkles disappear
sometimes i feel like people just start googling irritants
i don't feel like a product should get a bad rating for having fragrance
if you don't like certain ingredients
it's so lightweight but does the job.
my tzone is not anywhere near as oily as it used to get
it doesn't feel overpowering
need a good moisturizer that does not become greasy
i don't wear primer
it's not greasy/oily on my skin at all
it doesn't feel sticky or anything
i get lazy with applying stuff to my face mainly cause i'm uncomfortable with it feeling sticky or not matte
this did not clog my pores although it did not keep me matte it definitely keep me hydrated
it did not make me shiny
very few creams don't make me break out
almost everything irritates it
doesn't leave a film or residue on my face
doesn't make it look or feel oily at all after using it
the smell doesn't linger
they make my face feel "fake slippery"
you can tell it doesn't have any artificial scents in it too which is a plus
the smell is enough to feel refreshing without artificial or silly
nothing bothersome or that will break you out
does not irritate my skin or create an itchy sensation afterwards like some products do on me
that after using this makes me super greasy
doesn't feel sticky after application
i know this isn't from normal routine because i rarely break out
not greasy at all
the other one made my face too oily if i used it too frequently
it doesn't matter your skin type
not offensive or irritating
yet provides just the write amount of hydration to keep my skin from getting flaky
i can't leave the house without wearing it.
doesn't make you feel like it's just piling on more grease --
it's not irritating at all
you don't need a lot of it to make a difference with your skin
it didn't irritate my skin either
become very oily no matter what i put on my face
id suggest you stay clear from this product if you have oily skin
it's so light weight
i hate the feeling of grease on my face.
my under eye bags are always zombie like
below without feeling icky
it didn't irritate my skin at all.
it does not smell bad nor does it make your skin smell bad
my skin doesn't do well with normal primers
after about 5 bottles i can say this is a very light moisturizer which allows the skin to absorb it really quick
my oil zone doesn't get too oily from this
it's so lightweight that it literally melts into your skin
absorbs nicely so there isn't any stickiness on my pillow when i apply this at night
it dries so fast that i can barely massage it in as i like to do with face lotions
it's not too heavy
it's not just pilling up for no reason
this one proved trite
so there's no greasy or oily feeling
it's seems less heavy
it doesn't feel dry or too oily.
i do think it's improved the texture of my skin
whether it's be or liquid foundation
the spf in it doesn't burn my eyes
not greasy at all
it seems that many of the people are thinking it is the ingredients in the lotion that are working on the skin somehow when it is really a clever way to use the sunlight to get the same results as those $400+ red light treatment devices
doesn't irritate my skin
it does have at first a slightly funny smell
i would recommend this treatment cream to anyone who doesn't mind spending their day without foundation or tinted moisturizer
it's a big chunk of money
while i don't have many lines/wrinkles
this is the first lotion i've found that doesn't sting
which pretty much makes it the only lotion that doesn't
couldn't get over the greasiness
by the afternoon my face had an oily sheen to it that i just can't live with
don't need spf all the time
hate the smell so this is my attempt at upgrading my skin-care routine
but it's too harsh and pricey for me.
it is stupid under makeup or over it .
it makes you pretty on its own so a little concealer
if i don't wear it everyday it's better
only downside is it does make you shiny
the only drawback i notice is that if you use to much the product flakes off
makes my skin even in tone
one i don't like to wear
all kidding aside i really like this lotion.
it goes on easily without greasiness
however i can't use it anywhere i am oily.
"apply generously" does not mean glob it on
it's just so small
would order a few since they're so cheap
it's a product that gives results.
i cannot express enough my love for the instant de-puffing roll-on gel
how it soothes away anything visible that you want to hide
it feels so good when applying it under your eyes because of the three little balls on the applicator
it doesn't have a long term effect on the eye or dark circle
i think it does the job well when it comes to de-puffing
i unknowingly apply too much because the product comes out so easily out of the tube
instant results, love this stuff
not at all sticky
to the point you do not see the puffiness
i don't really have bags or puffs under my eyes to begin with
it feels like a little mini massage when you apply
it's great on those mornings after you have overindulged
not heavy like some.
sometimes i don't get enough sleep
if you suffer from puff you have to own this
doesn't really get rid of dark circles
if your problem is wrinkles
i do not suffer from chronically puffy eyes
it is not irritating at all
i don't get a lot of sleep
it goes on quickly and not "too" liquidy.
so those with oily skin might want to stay away
it's nice to have but is probably unnecessary.
it doesn't leave any kind of sticky
it doesn't interfere with how my makeup looks.
don't be a make-up snob like me
does what it says- it de puffs.
this is only an eye gel and can help oh so much.
a little roller ball can't fix this
it's easy to get out of the applicator
my only complaint might be that it's a little goopy
i don't notice that my bags have gotten puffier
this lets you have no reason to not have youthful
i can tell my eyes are less puffy
however, it doesn't get rid of dark circles.
does it's job without feeling too heavy
i also love that this doesn't leave behind a residue
it doesn't leave any film on my face like some other moisturizers
my skin texture is starting to even out.
it's like my skin has been needing this added moisture all along
i would not use this if you have oily skin
or in areas where you tend to get oily
i can immediately feel the difference in my skin once it's absorbed--so soft
which is one thing that the ptr hyaluronic cloud cream that i've been using doesn't do
everything i tried was too greasy or did nothing to keep my foundation from caking
this product is not greasy
doesn't leave a nasty feeling film over your skin
it doesn't make your facce feel wet
it doesn't feel bad on my skin like a lot of silicone-y products do
so weightless once you apply
doesn't leave you feeling greasy or tight
i only wish it came with a little scooper to take the product out of the jar with
didn't have to use my fingers to keep it more sanitary
it's a tad heavy at first
tends to freak out when it comes to certain products
for some reason i got less oily throughout the day
that smell is just yuck
i can't sleep comfortably with it on because the scent is just nauseating to me
this moisturizer doesn't make me more oily
it has a mild fragrance that isn't too bad.
this works wonders without making my skin greasy or more breakouts
it doesn't break the bank- so you may continue to feed your addiction
it doesn't take a lot of product to cover my whole face
it's been a long search.
my skin doesn't even get a hint of oil in the t zone
doesn't react with my makeup with those annoying patches
it doesn't do that gross peeling off thing when i use a primer either which is a problem i tend to have with some moisturizers
fresh that it doesn't irritate my skin
i can't stop smelling it
was not sticky or greasy at all
does not leave skin shiny or greasy.
otherwise it's a great, basic face moisturizer.
this is the first one that has left my skin soft without the feeling that there's something on it—no tackiness or anything other than smooth skin
doesn't do much to repair damaged skin
usually because of how greasy my face feels in the morning
when i don't wear makeup
it's works so well.
yes your skin isn't gonna feel moisturized after half an hour
it also does not seem to cause breakouts or skin irritation like other moisturizers i have tried
all moisturizers either make my face red or irritate it real bad
my face feels like a baby's bottom it's so smooth
all the ones i have tried have made my face really oily
it doesn't leave my face oily at all
no breakouts, not too thick nor watery.
doesn't exactly leave my face feeling super soft
it's not too thick
i do think it's odd that it's so perfumed for a face product
it's not too heavy of a moisturizer
it's not greasy and feels light.
this doesn't break my face out
doesn't leave behind a white cast or sticky feeling
it's just a simple, nice moisturizer.
i actually have not had any issues with oily skin during the day
it's light, simple, lightly fragranced-if any!!!
is not greasy at all
if you wear lots of makeup
you don't like scents i would still buy this product
no cream can take all your wrinkles away
don't forget to use on your lips before your balm
be sure to only use a tiny bit right after applying face lotion so that it stays smooth
i don't wear a lot of makeup
if it doesn't work for you in could be your diet
this cream will only work for those who eat a lot of wholesome veggie
mouth because i don't have wrinkles there yet
either they are too strong for my sensitivity or they do nothing to moisturize or combat wrinkles
especially because the container allows you to use all of it instead of most pumps that leave wasted cream where you can't get it
there is a stick applicator because you should put your fingers in the jar
i hardly have to use any concealer
i don't have many lines around my eyes
i feel the spatula is kind of a waste
i don't think it helps with dark circle
yet doesn't mess up your eyeliner
the price did sting a bit
so the one small spatula scoup lasts me for both eyes
didn't make it "ball up" like some eye creams do
it didn't irritate my eyes at all
make it impossible for me to wear makeup under my eyes
it doesn't make your eyes puffy
a cream cannot 100% erase my bad under eye genetics
my eyes don't look sunken anymore
i don't feel like i need to go out wearing tons of concealer everyday
there's not much that will help the hollows under my eyes
i put it on every day under makeup because i love the way my concealer looks when i use it
don't really have any wrinkles
i know it's pricey.
i didn't have any absorption or crease problems
perfect consistency, not too thick or too light.
i can tell they are worse when i won't leave the house without underage concealer
typically don't have huge expectations when it comes to eye creams
sometimes scaly undereyes that make concealer impossible because everything just dries me up like a lizard
i don't even have to wear any concealer i don't even remember how bad my bags were because this product was that good
as i keep my stuff in the fridge
nothing beats this eye cream
you could wear this under makeup.
so don't press all the way down as you'll get 2 days worth on your finger
it is not greasy
can't get the whole bag out of the bottle yet
while i don't yet have wrinkle
this eye cream does everything it promises to do.
they're dark circles in the morning.
you can use it on your eye lids
it's amazing what the little extra moisture in this cream will do
this eye cream does it all!!
minus one annoying thing
i think that's primarily due to the fact that this cleanser hardly suds
even better is that this is the only "cleanser" i've ever used that doesn't make my face feel dry
you may want your face to feel that way when you cleanse
it's like feeling new wrinkles form
couldn't believe that an oil would clean your skin
this product didn't leave my skin oily at all.
i didn't feel as if my skin was oily especially in the tzone
not much seemed to leak from the bottle thankfully
i do like that it's gentle enough to use around your eyes
not only does this gently
i love that it melts away even my heavy duty mascara
it is so gentle on the eyes that it doesn't matter if you get it in your eyes during the washing process
this does not make my skin feel oily.
it is too greasy to use during the day
it's not at all greasy
it's funny to read that someone that is under 40 uses this heavy-duty worker
cannot imagine wearing something this heavy during the day
i couldn't get it off my mind the smooth
didn't feel like i had that greasy sunscreen feeling
it's the only moisturizer thus far that is light enough to moisturize
doesn't leave any greasy feeling at all
i usually have trouble finding a good moisturizer to use
it is not greasy
which does happen from time to time with moisturizers with my type of skin
it is not too thick
i dont see or feel the dry skin anymore!
you wouldn't need to wash your h
t does take a bit more for me to see any signs of a sunburn
packaging is not the best since you have to dip your fingers in the tub
it doesn't feel greasy
t can soak in otherwise your foundation goes on super slick
because it's also not greasy
if you don't like super thick creams i recommend getting the emulsion in the same line
i can't use spf that well
i love to wear long-wearing makeup
this cream provides the moisture you need where you need it without a heavy oily feel
it's fighting against wrinkles
it's not heavy or greasy-it's just perfect
i didn't think it would suit my skin type because i'm usually a bit oily throughout the day
it's not greasy, and definitely light weight.
not heavy, not greasy.
must say that it is not heavy or thick upon application
this one has a very musky scent which bothers me right when i apply it
you can still wear eye makeup
the amorepacific eye cream that i'm obsessed with goes for like $300
can rarely find an eye cream that doesn't sting or make them react
definitely doesn't leave residue or ball up
doesn't ball up like some thicker eye creams do
which is why i love the gel-like texture of this
it also doesn't burn my eyes like most under eye creams do which is great
does not leave any residue under the eye
doesn't feel or go on like a gel
don't let the small size fool you
to the extent that it will peal if i do not moisturize on the daily
if it's in your budget
my eyes are super sensitive to everything making it impossible to buy stuff that goes near my eyes
it doesn't burn or irritate
i won't live without this eye cream.
the texture alone is enough to buy this eye cream
it's seriously changed my under eye bags
it's consistency is a light
though my boyfriend insists that my dark circles are lighter i just don't see the difference anymore
peeling or red anymore
i know that sounds exaggerated
gave it a four because i don't know if it will be like all other crüe creams when it comes to my dark circles
i swear i can see a difference in the skin below my eyes
i often lose a lot of sleep
it might be a little sticky
doesn't irritate my skin nor does it clog any pores
there's a jar inside the jar
you only need a dab .
i find using this alone is better than using concealer to "hide" my fine lines
plus my fine lines from dryness seem to disappear
you can not find a better eye creme
a tiny bit goes more then you'll think.
it's super pricey but it works.
coming from someone who cannot wear perfumes because scented anything gives me headaches
not so much that my mascara "bleeds"
you can actually feel the moisture being absorbed into your skin
doesn't keep me matte all day
it's rare to find a product that even makes a difference
doesn't have an offensive odor
no smell to it which i like.
often eye creams can burn or even leave milia
although i don't have wrinkles
it is not greasy so you don't have to worry about racoon eyes from your mascara coming off onto the eye gel
it doesn't leave a oily film
i don't have dark circles
i gave it 4 stars because i don't care for the scent
dont like the feel of moisturizers bc they feel heavy
this didn't make me breakout or extra oily.
just as it does your skin
i normally use hope in a jar
it doesn't feel too greasy to me
what little willpower or common sense i have evaporates
you only need a little dab of the cream
that doesn't pill when you apply foundation.
it's become my new moisturizer
the scent doesn't bother me
many products were either not hydrating enough or too oily
it left my face looking a little greasy for my taste
not only does it give my skin a shine
i did notice that it wasn't doing much for my super fine lines on my forehead
it doesn't feel greasy
it does not cause me to break out or irritate my sensitive skin
doesn't leave a greasy feeling on my skin
it's pricey, but i love that it is paraben free.
since i have not found a moisturizer that improves my oily skin- only makes it worse
because it's super refreshing to apply when it's cool
my skin just feels so pampered every single time i use it
it's also one of the only moisturizes that hasn't caused breakouts or any other skin issues for me
i can't live without this moisturizer!
other night creams i've used just seem to sit on top of the skin
it makes me feel guilty that i'm so superficial
i found it a little heavy to wear under my makeup
light enough for even the oily areas of my face
it doesn't look or feel greasy to me.
t doesn't leave a heavy greasy feeling
doesn't get bitty when applying foundation
could wear it under my makeup with no problem
the texture is somewhat like a paste so not only does it seem to absorb
also started to believe that a real good moisturizer could/should eliminate the need for a facial scrub
it's packaged like something a man could use
not sure if it's just the natural smell b/c of the ingredients or if it's artificial
when i use before my makeup i tend to mix a touch of water in with it
the only negative is that it's a little bit oily feeling when it's on my face
no pores sucking in whatever they can grab from my foundation
contains dimethicone which i'm not crazy about
it gives me almost no pores
this has not caused a single zit
doesn't feel oily or heavy
i usually can't use serums because they dry me out or break me out
this product also absorbs right into your skin so you don't feel like you have a heavy layer on your skin
swore i would go with the "other low cost stuff" or retinol
you can't even see redness anymore
i see a huge difference in my normally oily t-zone when using this product
didn't make my skin feel any more oily than normal
it does seem to make my moisturizer sink in better
oilier than you can imagine
you know the ones that aren't pimples
this product does not burn or sting
my pores seem less clogged
i also use ole henriksen pore refining cleansing cloths which seem to be a great combination
it was useless however this serum makes pores a tony bit smaller if you have very large pores you won't be satisfied however serums are meant to be used fir many months so our skin improves
it does seem to make the pores seem smaller
my face does end up getting oily as usual
lasts even longer if i wear blot powder.
it does minimize the look of your pores when you have it on
i can't help touching it
my pores did not completely disappear
the woman who does my facials actually reccomended this to me
i even find that before makeup application this tends to fill in small wrinkles for a more airbursh look
if i didn't have such bad under eye circles i wouldn't even wear makeup thanks to this goodness
i learned that you can't actually shrink your pores
that your skin still needs oil
this line doesn't really promote itself to help oily skin
i don't have a pore problem
i can't quit touching it
i can't say that i've noticed a reduction in the amount of pores i have
my pores ahhhh not seen a difference maybe a tiny bit
my only complaint is that it does make my skin quite oily
you'll notice the difference right away.
i know for a fact that pores cannot shrink
my t-zone was in such bad shape with clogged pores
made me feel hideous
for the simple fact that i don't need to
this product makes skin seem flawless after application
doesn't seem to do anything to help shrink pores
now i rarely get blackheads because of this
this is the only product that i feel not only masks my pores
even when i don't have makeup on
it cleared up my hormone-related acne even better -- i only get a few whiteheads here
tinted if that matters to you
it's great for daily use under makeup
it would sort of cancel out any pore-enlargement from tanning haha :
this stuff is kind of thick
this product does not irritate my skin at all
i know beauty experts say that one's pores cannot be made smaller
didn't find it oily at all
it does seem to make my skin even more oily after some time passes
i know he doesn't use any harmful ingredients
that alone keeps me a rouge!
it does help your skin look flawless
it doesn't smell to me
if i skip it's use
use after wash your face you your skin will glow even more
you may find your miracle in a jar like me.
did not work on "creases
they don't seem to be as deep
it doesn't irritate the skin
that's normal for my age
doesn't smell unpleasant at all
the "fishy" smell in most perricone products is not there
skin tone even out
she says her skin isn't even oily anymore
i don't care for the scent
does not feel oily or sticky like some serums may
sadly no creams do miracles
you can't just starve your face of moisture
my cheeks look like they're glowing from within.
kinda argan oil smell that immediately goes away
the deep ones between my brows had diminished a good amount although i can't tell if this is breaking me out
i still have the terribly empty bottle
is not at all greasy or too thick
i do not really like the bulb top delivery system as it is a little thick for it
i feel it might be better to have it in a bottle that you could dip a clean finger-tip in
don't want to add any more products to my routine until my skin is clear
i love it because it literally soaks into your skin leaving no residue
because i find if i use too much my face gets oily
it's going to be a just have in my daily facial routine
just don't forget use sunblock i think my skin is more sensitive after been using the cream
it is not going to remove your winkles
it will feed your skin with the proper stuff
use less of the moisturizer b/c i feel that some areas of my combo skin don't need as much moisturizer as they did before
it's been 2 weeks and my skin is smoother!
i don't have fine lines or wrinkles
when i don't use this product around my eyes
this product's ingredients do not irritate my skin at all
the worry wrinkle across my forehead that i hated so much
this product does not sting my face.
it does go on kind of thick
sometimes i can't use for extended periods
the product was so thick that the dropper could not pull it out
accidentally finding a great beauty product from something kinda gross
it's too early to give 5 stars
it makes your skin perfect in the matter of a few weeks
it smells like your skin is burning when you put it on
no breakouts which isn't often the case for me
it's less than a coffee a day
it doesn't seem fishy to me
i do not detect any fishy smell in this formula at all
not greasy at all
do not sleep in your makeup
i usually don't spend more than $50 on any facial cream
although i don't mind spending more on eye-creams
there's no offensive odor
it doesn't feel heavy
if it's out of your price range
it delivers on it's name
its just not perfumed which i prefer anyway
it's light and not greasy.
i don't usually spend money on "miracle potions"
goes on light not greasy
anti- aging with a light weight that doesn't melt off during a hot flash
doesn't give me acne.
it's light and absorbs right it.
you don't need a whole lot because it spreads over your skin
not leaving your skin greasy
there's a bit more firmness to you skin
doesn't have much of a smell.
it's not dry and red anymore.
5 oz size because it not only doesn't effect the powder i wear daily
doesn't leave any kind of unpleasant residue
winter always wreaks havoc on my skin.
i can't rate it an an anti-ager until i have used it a little longer
which is starting to look a little like crepe paper if i don't do anything to it
it plumps up or hydrates the skin cells so they look more like they did when i was in my teens actually
this can't do anything for deep set wrinkles
it really does not cause breakouts even if i slather it on
gentle enough for every day use
after you've used all your old products up like i'm trying to do
if i didn't already have a moisturizer as part of my regular skin care routine
doesn't make my face feel greasy or break out
it's so light and absorbs so quick!!!
i usually hate my skin
i can't stop touching it
not a dewy finish it is just like your skin
it did not leave a white cast
if you can swing it to treat yourself
otherwise, i have an oily t-zone.
doesn't make me oilier
otherwise it goes wonky with overactive oil gl
does not leave a film on the skin or turn my face white
is not too heavy for my oily skin
it doesn't leave your skin looking greasy
once you get past the fact that this stuff smells like eucalyptus cough drops
it doesn't leave as much of a coating as other spf products
you know that finding a sunscreen that doesn't irritate your skin is like finding a needle in a haystack
this product does the job without irritating my skin
(the ole henriksen oil helps with the smell too.)
i do not even get shiny throughout the day at all
if anything it's just a "clean" smell
not too smelly lotion absorbs so well into skin it feels like i'm not wearing anything
the thing that sells me is the texture it makes my skin
my skin looks like i have a primer on
peel off if i massage it on for too long
t doesn't seem like it absorbs into the skin very well
i actually have a pretty oily t-zone
can't attest to it's wrinkle fighting ability
it isn't too bad
often skip eye cream
it doesn't stink for me
even if it doesn't help with wrinkles
only on concealer-heavy days because it's a little too rich for my young
i usually like the thicker stuff.
it's gentle and doesn't irritate.
i didn't notice anything miraculous beyond it being hydrating
been using this eye cream at night only because it's too greasy to use during the day under makeup
i didn't get near the moisture or benefits
i don't yet have many fine lines or wrinkles
the smell doesn't last
can't comment if this product works on wrinkle
i can't believe the texture change
makeup did not hide the dark circles
or every day even when i'm not wearing makeup
i rarely lose anymore lashes
this stuff isn't cheap
even just one use makes my eyes less puffy
i swear i don't need any makeup because my skin looks even
primer so makeup doesn't cake in my lines
it doesn't cause makeup to separate under eyes
great eye cream to use if you're starting to get into eye creams
my eyes seem less tired or sunken
i honestly thought eye cream claims to reduce wrinkles were bogus
i don't have dark circles
it's also not greasy or wet
it's not too sticky feeling
etc this seemed like an easy after cleansing deal
hate to admit at 27 that i have mild fine lines around my eyes
a little thing annoy me is when i apply the eye cream
it's kind of irritate my eyes
i don't really suffer from lines or dark circles
doesn't leave my under eye area greasy
because you only need a dab
does not clog the pores around my eyes
i can't really speak to its anti-aging properties
it doesn't leave a lot of residue
i don't have dark circles
it's also not greasy or wet
does not appear wet or greasy which is nice because it recommends you use twice a day so when you apply it in the morning it's not visible
it's a good eye cream for the price point
it isn't greasy at all
it did seem to brighten my eye area
it also doesn't break me out because i am acne prone
if it's pilling you used to much product
they're also great eye creams
any other eye creme i used was too thin
it's just full of moisture.
i really haven't experienced the " white residue " that most people talk about unless i a
you need the tiniest bit!
i don't think it matters how thin i apply this
and trust me a little goes a loooooong way.
the only problem i have is after it dries the package says you can apply concealer
and you'll get great result.
fills in wrinklesi used this off/on for years not really liking the white residue
just don't touch where you applied the instant firmx eye
you can set with powder though.
the only downside is sometimes i get the white residue
but this stuff rocks.
it's an instant fix, not a treatment.
do not move your face muscles while it dries
but boy, when it's on right...zero wrinkles.
don't smile or make expressions for 10 minutes
once you've gotten used to it
it looks like you've applied thin cement to your face
i also wait a little bit to apply concealer over this
yes you have to use it sparingly.
you'll need to "play" with the application 3-4 times until you make it work so that there are no white residuals
i found powder works better as it doesn't dilute the instan firmx --btw this product absorbs quickly so be quick on this stepd
pat it in small circles as you do it
i felt it's not very easy to rub onto the skin
wrinkles are the problem bothers you the most
when i do that i don't get any white residue under eye others have mentioned
i wear it without makeup
once you wash it off you will notice your puffiness disappears instantly
it can leave a slight white residue if you use too much
the reason people are having a problem with white flakiness is that they are not applying it properly
simply pat the very tiniest amount onto your under eye puff
sometimes i see a little white flakiness
don't use too much or it looks cakey
frequently get really bad bags under my eyes from the lack of sleep
my only issue with the product is that you can't really put any creamy makeup on top of it or it'll start to crumble
beware because it's hard to put any other makeup in the under eye region when using the product
or yes you will end up with a little white residue so you don't need a lot
now i apply just a tiny bit to a totally clean skin
does not have any deep set wrinkles
you won't need that concealer when you use this
note if you have white residue then you are using too much
de-puff underneath your eyes when you need it
i miss in a little concealer with it for extra effect
although it does get flaky after using
it's really just shadows from the bags
luckily, there's instant firmx eye.
about the white residue: simply wait 5
i know of no other product that does it--i'm an eye-cream junkie
to rid myself of those pesky
get rid of my allergies for that
i don't use this everyday just when my eyes are puffy
for anyone who has had an issue w/it appearing flaky give that a try
in a few minutes you feel the coolness
if there's any white residue
rub it to make sure it is mixed
is not only for people with puffy eyes
i believe it's a necessity in every makeup bag
this stuff masks that problem.
doesn't make you oily
nothing seems to shrink them
i don't know what makes it so much better than other silky silicone type fillers
if i want even more perfected pores i also put that ysl pink balm in the pink compact over it too
still gets a shiny even with it
doesn't irritate or cause breakouts
i won't wear foundation without it.
it's all i use for my skin care needs.
not greasy, not too matte.
you kind of have to smear it around the bigger pores making sure its "filling" the pore
that it's flush with your skin
and you only need a tiny bit so it lasts forever.
it doesn't make my face feel oily or greasy at the end of the day
truly hides large pores until you wash it off.
i also usually rub a little extra over my nose to reduce the pores
lightly tap it into the areas you want to treat
i don't really see that it minimizes my pipes
makes my pores seem to disappear
to apply, don't just wipe it over your skin.
doesn't clog the pores
like i do because i don't like heavy coverage
otherwise, it tends to get flaky.
my pores aren't huge
it is esentially a primer
it sinks right into my humongous pores
it stays matte and doesn't budge.
it does not completely make them invisible like past pore primers have done for me in years past
i really like this product it make your pores disappear
i do notice that it adds a little shine to my face
it doesn't irritate my eyes but cleanses my skin.
no products is going to actually change your pore size
i never need to use concealer or face powder anymore
it really does make large pores on my nose disappear
it does not clog the pores
it does a good job of keeping your nose from getting shiny
i wouldn't say the invisible light covers exactly
it doesn't disturb makeup
by the end of the work day my t-zone is so shiny it looks like i have the face sweats
we all know nothing can *actually* shrink pores
the only cleansing oil that doesn't burn my eyes
i don't use it everyday
doesn't cause break outs
when i use this i don't have to wear as much powder or touch up
will not clog my pores
it acts as a primer too, for me.
as in cannot even see my pores after i apply it
i also normally have an oily t-zone withn about 3 hours
actually does seem to minimize pores
anything that can help hide the big pores is a product for my arsenal of make-up goodies
i seriously don't even feel like i have to wear foundation when i use this on my nose a near-nose cheek area
i mainly purchased it because it's sweat
so anything to reduce shine is a plus for me
i don't have huge pores
i feel like it tightens the skin where i apply it
it's not greasy at all
it really does fill in pores
that if i have not exfoliated well that it will leave a sort of flakey film around my nose
if it won't pop
this stuff just kind of blurs all of those details out
i often use it on my nose
doesn't cause my sensitive skin to break out
doesn't seem to do much for my cheeks or forehead
my skin does not look as irritated
i generally use makeup wipes to take my eye makeup off anyways because i don't love running oil on my eyes
not to mention it's so easy to remove my full face makeup
this cleans your makeup off so easily
here is how oil cleansers work.
you aren't supposed to get suds.
they just add foaming agents to give the illusion of better cleaning
i've seen a lot of reviews where they say it leaves your skin really oily or the oil didn't come off well
i prefer to use this in the morning on a makeup free face versus at night to wash off the makeup as it's not that great for that
everyone's skin is different
t doesn't leave me oily
this product does not take off all eye makeup.
this isnt a huge deal for me as i don't wear heavy makeup
this product doesn't taste good
it's not easy to dry rub this on your face before adding water
it's literally the only problem with this
it's thick when you first start using
it does it without stripping my skin
side note i do not use it to remove my eye makeup
it's a permanent staple and i won't stray again.
this is my saving grace of cleansers because it does not dry out my skin
i don't even have words to describe this cleansing oil
it takes off makeup so easily
it doesn't irritate or break me out
my only complaint is that sometimes it doesn't go on the skin so smoothly
what i don't like is the taste when it gets on my mouth
oil where it usually is
this is even great if you aren't wearing makeup because it gets off any extra dirt or oils
it's great for all skin types even oily!
i literally can't find anything else that gets my skin feeling so clean before i go to bed
its that point of the month where my skin is blah
didn't think this oil cleanser would work on my combo skin tone
it gets all of my eye makeup off like it's no issue
could not do: this stuff is little by little unclogging the pores in my t-zone
this stuff takes off every drop of makeup
the only bad thing is that it sometimes gets in my mouth
this stuff just melts your makeup off.
you will not have joker lipstick smears
it comes off clean, and doesn't feel greasy.
it doesn't remove heavy eye make-up well
definetely doesn't dry the skin out
don't get in your eyes or it will make your vision quite blurry
cleaning oil which sounds crazy in helping rid acne got rid of it all
doesn't clog my pores or anything.
clear because it dries my face sooooo bad
i feel this cleans my skin so much better than any other cleanser filled with artificial chemicals
it's a bit thick but i actually enjoy it.
don't get it in your mouth
leaves your face soooo clean without overdrying.
that is how thick this stuff is
i do not wear makeup besides eye
i think if i were wearing heavy makeup
since i don't wear face makeup
i prefer it over my other cleansers in my stash
i know you're technically supposed to use a face wash after cleansing with this product
it doesn't leave my skin oily at all
in fact i would argue that it actually help keep oiliness at bay
my skin doesn't break out at all when i use this product
tastes gross if you get it in your mouth
it's good for all types of skin
because my skin hated the loccitane oil omfg those were some dark days
allergic to anything that has any kind of nice smell
it's an oil so naturally it does not lather
this is the oil cleanser that started my obsession with everything oil
not only did it remove makeup wonderfully
i put a bit on my beauty blender
this won't clean your face
thought that perhaps i was just doomed to have horrible grey ugly skin
not the case this is an amazing product my skin glows it removes all the make up off my face yes
i am a user for life again was very dubious slathering oil all over my face
if you've never oil cleansed it takes time
or it becomes too oily
for my skin type
like after a peel or something
that's nothing because the cleaning power this cleanser has
i don't like the idea of using any liquid or oil around my eyes
doesn't leave me oily at all it's a perfect balance
i've legit washed my skin wish this cleanser after extracting
it's a lot thicker than the mac cleanse off oil
i didn't get that foggy filmy feeling in my eyes
i dont usually wear foundation
you can't take the top off
its ok products i have sensitive skin it doesn't give break out
i love this moisturizer because it doesn't break me out or make my skin greasy
somehow got a taste of the product
doesn't break out my sensitive skin
it is a bit sticky on the face which i dislike
texture it somehow keeps my skin clear
the packaging needs to be redone cuz i've stopped using the cream because it seems like a waste of money to throw away so much of the product in the bottle
i can't wear my make up without applying this moisturizer first
is not greasy at all
i look for moisturizers that are not heavy or oily because i tend to get oily in my t-zone
i don't even wear foundation
t's not greasy at all
it will not clog your pores
it's how often you apply it
the amount of sunscreen in this is not overwhelming yet still gives you some sun protection
i can go all day without having to blot or check my face for an oily shine
it's not too heavy and it has sunscreen.
it doesn't feel sticky or oily at all
i definitely recommend this for those who have oily skin or combination skin
i wouldn't recommend it for someone with oily skin
i no longer have to settle for lotion that is passable
it's amazing on it's own and under my makeup.
not greasy at all.
my only complaint is that sometimes it leaves a shiny "layer" on my skin
it does not actually make me oily
is not oily where it would make my t-zone worse
my skin usually can't h
preps skin for anything
it might not be great for someone with oily skin because i don't know if it's too moisturizing
does not leave my skin looking greasy
this product doesn't make my skin look oily
even if you don't like the scent
i tried this as a sample so my comments are not from continuous use:pros-lightweighthydratingdoes not trigger breakoutscons-you can feel the spf when you first apply the lotionleaves face a little sticky
the only issue i have is sometimes when it's really hot it doesn't absorb all the way
it is so light that i don't feel greasy using this during the summer
almost everything about this is perfect: it's the right consistency for my combination skin
it doesn't have that weird smell that most moisturizers with spf have
my face doesn't break out with it
the only down side is you have to be careful with it around your eyes since the fragrance can make them watery
it is not greasy at all
i don't feel like it made my skin more greasy
i gave it four stars because it did clog my pores just a bit
doesn't smell like spf
doesn't make me extra oily which is great since i have combo/oily skin
the type of mosturizer you use will make or break your make routine
does not promote greasiness
it does have a weird taste to it if you get it too close to your lips
it's not oily so even if you accidentally put too much on it won't make your skin look shiny
it's been just fine
spf i need for my day without making my skin greasy
on days when i do wear makeup
doesn't feel greasy on my skin at all
which i've not sure if it's because of the low spf
getting a few dastardly lines
it doesn't leave my skin oily
perhaps because it's so light
t doesn't interfere with your fragrance
the fact that this emulsion is so light means that it's less likely to clog pores
although i can't say how it might work for people with combination or oily skin
i would definitely recommend this product for oily skin
it wasn't just a good skin day it's this moisturizer
doesn't burn my eyes
doesn't disturb my makeup
doesn't leave a tacky feel
t doesn't suck up all the makeup i'm wearing
flaky skin without any greasy look or feel
which makes my skin peel like crazy
this is the only moisturizer i've used that doesn't leave me feeling extra oily or thick on the face
it doesn't make my face feel greasy.
i like the smell too.
it's a thick formula but it works for me.
this cream is best used before bed rather than immediately before applying lotion because admittedly
i don't even wear makeup
it doesn't have a very liquidy or oily feel at all
it's not too heavy to wear
as it does not contain spf
i don't use this during the day because it doesn't contain spf
it's a little heavy for every day use during the summer
other times it's normal
unfortunately it doesn't absorb
even if a heavier moisturizer is not your thing
just made my skin even more oily then other moisturizers
it's not for those who sweat easily under moisturizer
doesn't feel too greasy to me
i tend to enjoy it
it's not too heavy but not too light.
i find sometimes i have to use two face creams for my face to not feel dry
the price isn't bad
very soothing after you take your makeup off
i wish it didn't contain such heavy fragrance.
not greasy at all
i didn't break out with my combination skin
such a great moisturizer that doesn't feel greasy
it is a bit greasy
especially if you wear glasses.
yet doesn't irritate my eczema at all
make up doesn't smudge
doesn't go on greasy at all
it doesn't make my skin super oily
it can be greasy
looks cute on your vanity too!
actual jar is really cute
the consistency is a bit thick however on your skin it is not
doesn't feel heavy or sticky
is not greasy for me at all
was hoping it wasn't the moisturizer
i can still smell it on my face
products like this would usually break me out
after trying out benefit's "it's potent" eye cream
don't use it all over my face
i love that it doesn't leave a greasy feeling
i didn't want my face to get used to one moisturizer
smells exactly like my yes to cucumbers body
i do think there's a layer of some sort of oil that my skin doesn't absorb
t can feel a little slick
it doesn't make my skin oily or breakout
is light enough to wear under makeup
rich enough to use as my night cream
it doesn't leave that greasy feel i would get from using clinique moisturizers
it gives you just the right amount of moisture
i tend to get obnoxiously dry skin
have a hard time finding moisturizers that prevent peeling yet don't make my skin super oily
are looking into trying this is truly the only moisturizer that doesn't dry your skin out--because there is no cetaryl alcohol or other types that dry skin out
it's mildly scented, a little goes a long way.
i wouldn't use it as a day time moisturizer though because i think it's a little thick for me
not strong enough to annoy
it is a bit too thick if you want to wear it during the day on your face
it actually fights flakiness
because it can look a little oily after application
i wouldn't really recommend it if you have oily skin though
however, it's a quick fix.
this doesn't leave a film
it doesn't sit on top of your skin
even if i buy $200 eyecream it usually useless for me because it hurt my eyes ruin my makeup
everyone's skin is different
if you need to lighten dark circles this is a holy grail find
also, doesn't affect eye makeup.
it's so refreshing to put on at night
yet dissolves on the skin extremely quickly so there is no shiny/greasy look under your eyes
it doesn't moisturize as much as i'd like
if you want to treat your fine lines or wrinkles
i prefer a lightweight cream which feels somewhere in between a gel
sometimes i don't get a lot of sleep.
i wake up with puffy eyes more often than i don't
this stuff is a miracle in a cute little jar!
this wasn't as pricey as other eye creams at sephora
pores the size or god knows what
the only con is that it's not really hydrating
my only complaint/warning is it really stings if you get too close to your tear duct
it's almost like a dark circle eraser
this eye cream genuinely does help fade the dark circles
unless you're allergic to it
i believe it's the caffeine added that helps with the dark circles
as someone who suffers from terrible allergies most eye creams make my eyes puff up
before they were so dark i couldn't even conceal them
yes it's potent is it
if you solely want it for hydration or your eye circles aren't very dark
i notice my eyes seem less dark
now it's all she'll use
i feel like there is less product in the tarte one than this
does not sting my eyes like many eye creams do
the only thing i don't love about it is the texture it leaves behind
it's paraben free too
my circles aren't as dark
that you can see easily through concealer
it doesn't get rid of my dark circles as it claims
doesn't irritate the area around my eyes
this cream does help with that a bit.
doesn't burn or irritate my sensitive eyes
it hits the skin there with so much moisture that i didn't realize my skin was lacking every day
sometimes i get some in my eye
if i accidentally get a little of benefit in my eye it doesn't burn or bother me
i also find it doesn't make my eyelids feel heavy or my under eyes feel goopy
i dont wear concealer anymore.
this does not irritate my skin or my eyes at all
it's the best thing i've tried so far to combat my puffy eyes
the only gripe i have with this eye cream is that it's not quite moisturizing enough for my dry skin
it stings alot if you get it accidentally in your eye
it doesn't do any more for my under eye circles than other eye creams i've used
i don't know if it has caffeine in it
i don't think my skin can ever be completely free of rosacea
however it dries completely matte without the residue or greasiness so many other creams leave
if anything it is soothing
didn't irritate the burn more
there is still one bad place where it's red
get a sample of this before buying because its not like the ole henriksen thin quick absorbing one
the flakiness is almost gone
reactive skin--it doesn't make my condition worse
if you want an artificial sweetness it means there are more chemicals in there
i don't know the cause of the redness
it's so easy to blot
sinks in well and doesn't pill.
nose for as long as i can remember
this cream works wonder on my skin
is too thick to use under foundation: makes it cake
there's no greasiness at all
great for diaper rash too.
it really soaks in, isn't greasy though.
i just use a little on my cheeks
using exfoliators or more drying products just irritates it like crazy
it's too heavy to use every day
it's only for occasional use for me
but, it's in a aluminum type tube.
although it's quite thick
doesn't make my redness flare up
i like it for a winter time because it's a little bit oily
at the same time it doesn't make my skin oily
especially on my nose which tends to peel if i don't get enough moisture
breaks out if my skin gets too oily
can't live without the cleansers either.
since using this product i haven't gotten any of the deep pimples
i do still get some small pimples
i don't have many wrinkles
don't take my word for it: simply apply the cream to your face as usual
otherwise whatever you use just sits on your face
for those who don't like feeling product on their skin
i rarely give 5 stars
best of all not saggy-big difference with this lotion
this stuff has actually cleared all the blackheads on my nose
this stuff has actually cleared all the blackheads on my nose
this stuff has actually cleared all the blackheads on my nose
this stuff has actually cleared all the blackheads on my nose
this stuff has actually cleared all the blackheads on my nose
this stuff has actually cleared all the blackheads on my nose
this stuff has actually cleared all the blackheads on my nose
it doesn't smell that bad either
once it dries, you really can't smell it at all.
you will get a gentle peeling which i don't mind since i know it's working
"thick skinned" gals like me might want to give it a try
i still dont know about the anti aging effect
the product is not at all irritating
it seems to help plump up fine lines to the point where they're not visible
the only negative is that it leaves my skin somewhat tacky
got rid of my blotches from too much fun in the sun
this stuff though pricey will transform your skin
my bottle looks like i have barely used any product
i removed 1 star because i can't really tell if it's minimizing dark circles because i don't have bad ones
i am 47 and don't sleep enough.
although it's hooey to expect or claim that a cream can correct dark circles- hello genetics- having a moisturized
dark circles don't seem as bad
can't say much about it's wrinkle reducing properties
definitely do not need a full squirt/pump of the dispenser
i don't have dark circles
i guess it's due to my eyeshadows
anyways they seem dry sometimes especially on my eyelid
they go from bad to worse depending on my diet
it does not clog my easily clogged undereye pores like most eye creams do
i usually like dermadoctor wrinkle revenge
not sure if the dark circles improved 'cause i love me some concealer
non greasy it does not shift or smear my eye makeup
have horrible allergies so the dark circles around my eyes tend to be bad
doesn't sting when i apply it
this cream helps to minimize them so that the concealer doesn't settle in there
trying endless products for my dark circles
the cream cannot completely erase my dark circles forever
it doesn't give a ton of moisture
i actually had to stop using another eye cream because of its terrible scent
the smell bothers me
i know this doesn't contain fragrance
i can't believe this eye cream only has 2
because i have super sensitive eyes i can put this product right up to my lashline with no problem
don't get acne or anything like that
if anything gets in them they are a non stop watery annoying mess
love that it doesn't have bad ingredients in it
no eye cream is going to work miracles
my only reason for not giving 5 stars is the packaging: the tube often gets clogged
this is a great basic eye cream that does not irritate my eyes
do not have deep wrinkles
i always hated applying eyeshadow because my dry skin made it look awful
eye cream isn't going to remove those circles
what eye cream does?
doesn't feel tacky or too thick
i can't speak to its effectiveness with fine lines or dark circles
doesn't irritate my eyes
doesn't cause milia to form
is neither greasy not tacky
it's light enough to use under makeup
there's a little plug in the tip that you have to pop
it works great with it it does not make my concealer crease
not at all irritating
a very precise squeeze tube instead of an awful tub where you have to stick your fingers in to get product
i don't really have dark circles or bags
you shouldn't wear it out in the sun
does not irritate my eyes
makeup goes over it no problem
this is the first eye cream i've tried that doesn't make them burn
i can't afford the $100+ creams unless it's a sample
this is the first eye cream i have found that doesn't irritate my sensitive eyes
doesn't feel too thick
um, did everyone miss that it has retinol?
i don't think it can get rid of age related under eye circles
i like that it's in a tube instead of a pot.
it doesn't sting or burn
so even if you accidentally get it in your eye
the bottle makes you waste a lot of product
not greasy at all
does seem to reduce wrinkles.
it's not grease on my skin.
i am not sure about it ridding wrinkles or dark circles
this isn't really an anti-aging remedy
the bottle doesn't dispense too much at once
i also like that it isn't a greasy mess
i couldn't wear eye makeup without paying for it big time afterwards with dry
i still don't know if the texture of mine is normal
a little about me, i'm 23 with really oily skin.
i feel like it takes all the gunk out
he likes a more rough type of exfoliator for his face as opposed to gentle scrubs or ones that have the little micro beads
i don't really get a "foamy" or "milky" effect though until i rinse it
make sort of a paste out of it
i guess that's if you have uber sensitive skin
to me it's a great exfoliator that i even can use in between chemical peel rounds
no need to scrub hard
it's only mildly foamy
this stuff really removes all that gunk
i apply the aha concentrate first then 1 pump of the mask a thin layer is all you need to cover your face
it doesn't really remove my main concern which was dark spots caused my pimples
also does not help with blackheads
so be careful to scrub gently- you don't need much friction to get results with this scrub
i would recommend it to anyone with normal or oily skin type
it's like a massage on your skin every time you use it
have used it my self as we'll
the mask is thick-you don't need a full pump.
i prefer the ones without too many granules.
there is a really mild scent which doesn't aggravate my eyes
doesn't leave any kind of film or residue on my skin
i didn't get the foaming part
you only need a dime size to create a lather
the fact that my mia 2 scrub brush does the same thing
4 stars for being a medium scrub that doesn't seem to work as well as done pricier products
not filled with junk
it does not foam up
while i don't have much acne
it's gentle enough that i can use a face brush
it's not too harsh on your skin
i do like the way the polish works
love the pure ingredients too
you definitely can clean your face with a just small dab
so basically i did got exfoliate
this is so gentle it doesn't irritate it at all
i am only giving four stars because i feel the manufacturer doesn't fill the bottle up completely
it's lasting a while anyway
only air comes out sometimes
it has gotten rid of my dull skin
t actually going to go exfoliate deep into the skin as well when i rinse off my skin is not red like most scrubs
also on the plus side is that it's in a tube
day's grime is just one facet
there's a lot of air in it.
a worker at sephora recommended this to me after i mentioned that my usual exfoliator wasn't cutting it
you don't need too much if your face is wet enough to lather it up
it's not too drying
it feels good and isn't too harsh or chafing.
haven't found a better moisturizer that doesn't make me breakout
use it only 2-3 times a week so the micro polishers won't end up irritating your skin
i rarely wear makeup so good skin is a must for me
once the cleanser starts foaming up it's much better
doesn't irritate or cause redness
doesn't scratch up my skin in the process
it doesn't foam up too much
when you use it on your skin
it doesn't feel like it's too harsh
they aren't harsh at all
you can feel them dissolve a bit
that doesn't last forever like with any scrub
you can use it on acne prone skin
doesn't clear up any dark spots
doesn't leave you feeling greasy
i just hate how it kind of foams white.
i still do get an occasional hormonal blemish
plus you can feel good that you aren't putting anything icky on your skin
spilling a not cheap product everywhere
i won't be wasting this stuff by being clumsy
i apply the aha concentrate first then 1 pump of the mask a thin layer is all you need to cover your face
sometimes it's good to ignore the buzzwords that flutter around your concerns
i wouldn't say my skin was dull or unenergetic before
i don't think it helps with hydration at all though
does not make skin look shiny at all
i used it after my ren glyco peel thinking 'alright might as well give it a go'
it gives my skin extra protection in the winter without being too greasy
i don't like the smell
doesn't leave a greasy feel
i can already too my acne scars
sometimes it'll get in my contact lenses
if i wear primer
i don't have any problems wearing it under makeup
it is not greasy.
doesn't do much for darkness under my eyes
i can't even use eye drops
her new one is too greasy
sometimes you need a change
won't waste the spf
i love that it's a thicker consistency
it sort of just makes sense to protect your eyes with spf too
with the warmth of your fingers you can easily pat it in
it doesn't burn mine at all
doesn't burn or sting at all on me
everyone's skin is different
it's the first time that i have noticed how nicely my under-eye concealer goes on
never forget the eye creme
it doesn't break out my sensitive skin
it's thick yet light on my skin.
only down fall is it's a little bit greasy
none irritating to my eyes
i've looked a long time for an eye cream with spf that won't bother my eyes
even though it has spf it doesn't sting the eyes
i love this eye cream because it has an spf in it
since it has spf i dont have to worry about about putting on extra spf
it's on the thicker side
i don't get enough sleep
it generally doesn't appear that way
it's amazing how many of them don't have any sun protection
it's hard to find an eye cream that is thick
which can be annoying
it doesn't irritate my sensitive skin or burn my eyes
there is no cream miracles to the face or eyes even the $500 ones
just wanted to add that i have fairly oily skin
i love that it's not greasy
doesn't leave any residue or shine
i think this product works for me because the eye cream is not greasy
not oily or too heavy
so just pat it on lightly
i did notice if you put it on your top brow bone
it does seem to creep down
would not recommend it for those individuals with oily skin
it does sting sometimes but it is what it is.
it's so thick that you just need a little for each eye
does not irritate my eyes
having it look obvious i am trying to coverup my dark circles
can't speak for the anit-aging
and i have bad circles.
sting if im not careful
not too heavy or greasy.
give it time because your skin will get used to the cream
it doesn't irritate my eyes and hydrates well.
easy to wear under concealer too.
i did not want an anti-aging eye cream.
this cream does not ork on the bags however it did provide moisture
for those who say it's too greasy
the cream is thick enough that you only need a tiny bit
no dark circles or crows or anything
even though this is not an "anti-aging" eye cream
especially if you use products from a dermatologist like i do
this doesn't irritate me
the smell doesn't bother me
it does seem a little drying
my skin responded very well to this because it didn't strip it of oils
i don't even have to use a wipe for extra mascara
tried so many other cleansers such as ole henriksens on the go cleanser
then you know how difficult it is to find a cleanser that does not strip your skin of all of your oils
my skin will sometimes burn or turn red after some cleansers
remove makeup without irritating my pansy skin that will not st
pretty much every fash wash out there for sensitive skin
everything i tried could cause a allergic reaction
it's not too foamy which i like
this does not lather up therefore doesn't give your face that squeaky clean feel
in wear a ton of makeup everyday to work
even though it's an oil cleanser
i can't agree that it is too foamy
i will never use any other facial wash again
i like to consider myself as having dry skin since the oil doesn't bother me too much
i noticed that this cleanser is free of just about everything that can trigger my eczema
despite it's price tag
that i could start using for my acne prone skin
hoped just a basic gentle cleanser would do the trick
anyways just a pea size amount on my brush is enough
doesn't have a tight feeling
the product does take off makeup
the fact that it is in a glass bottle is insane
it does not strip my skin like other soaps
does not leave it feeling oily like so many creams
it doesn't feel tight or look shiny.
it is gentle yet takes off all of my makeup.
i don't have mascara running all down my face
sometimes it's better to keep things simple.
this is the only daily cleanser that i have yet to find that does not irritate my skin
it does not leave my skin feeling tight like other cleansers
doesn't remove all of my make-up
if it falls in the shower, you're screwed.
but it's actually quite mild.
this is the only cleanser that doesn't make me break out
what do you use on your skin"
have trouble finding products that won't irritate
it's doesn't leave a weird residue or leave your skin dry
the product is not harmful what so ever to my facial skin
it is so mild that it doesn't irritate my skin
yet cleanses my face so that there are no breakout issues
it's not a chemical smell at all.
i think it's just a smell from one of the ingredients
it stings a little if it gets in your eyes
you get the anti aging too
it doesn't do much other than gently cleanse
i don't need to even use a full pump of this product to clean my face
it removes most of my makeup except for more stubborn waterproof eye makeup
what i like is that it doesn't leave a greasy residue afterwards
can't be too safe
can't beat that if you're going to splurge on cleanser
it sucks to have the ups
its funny because i have larger pores now that i am 30
this becomes a problem when i want to put on concealer or cover up to minimize the dark circles
pretty much every eye product i try causes me to get blotchy red spots or bumps
even though it is rich it doesn't cause any bumps around my eyes either
i hate gels bc they feel sticky
not sure if it eliminates lines
i don't have issues with dark circles
my concealer doesn't seep in the few fine lines i have
give it some time depending on how bad your wrinkles are
it doesn't completely reduce my dark eye circles
hydrates enough that one application does the trick for the day
this one doesn't tingle and doesn't dry me out.
this eye cream doesn't irritate my skin
not too thin or greasy
it doesn't irritate my eyes
being that it's so pricey
doesn't irritate my skin at all
doesn't feel tight like some "firming" creams can
it took me years to find a cream that wouldn't irritate it
the only thing i would complain about is that my mascara smudges onto my face cause of the cream
just melts into your skin
it is tempting to slather it on because it feels so good
it truly doesn't take much of the cream because it is very rich
note: i would recommend careful use of this cream around your eyes
i don't have any wrinkles
low for an eye cream that does not irritate my eyes
this is the only product i've used that doesn't irritate my eyes or skin
it does seem to smooth the wrinkles a bit.
it doesn't sting or irritate the delicate skin around my eye
it doesn't make my eyes burn
it's not too rich
it does not bother my allergy eyes at all
i already notice that i don't need to cover up my dark circles like i used to
it does not make eye make up messy or look weird like some of the heavy eye creams do
i love it more because of it's natural ingredients
don't let the small jar deceive you
low for a good eye cream that doesn't make my eyes puffier or cause my make up to smear off
hydrates like nothing else
it doesn't irritate at all
i hate that it's so expensive
it's lightweight and doesn't break me out.
it also does not "melt" into my eyes in the heat as annoyingly as some i have tried
i see some plumping and even texture now.
i sometimes use a primer
then realized this little pot of moisturizer really lasts
it's unlike any other moisturizer i have used
good for young skin too because it doesn't contain retinol or anything too harsh on the skin
it tends to dry my skin or if i dont use acne products
i've tried so many other "sensitive" skin day creams that just don't cut it or irritate my skin
you can tell you aren't getting a lot of "filler" like the less expensive creams
i love that it doesn't have all sorts of anti-aging chemicals in it
one would expect that after you clean your face you should moisturize
let's start with the negatives-i hate the price: it's way too expensive for a small jar
once it's in the skin
the smell diminishes so that's fine
but doesn't feel sticky or greasy on my skin.
once it's absorbed i don't smell it anymore.
i would never put anything on my face that could make it greasy or oily
my face does not feel greasy with perricone moisturizer
i find that my sensitive skin can't h
it doesn't feel greasy at all
my skin is not prone to break outs
a little dab will do it
it's so effective but not heavy at all.
now when i apply light foundation to my face you can't see some of the sun spots i used to have on my cheeks
i don't care if it's expensive
even though it's pricey
if i wear makeup
blemishes that wouldn't go away with anything
to absorb and do it's thing.
it doesn't leave residues
which can't be seen with make up on
my skin looks even
as it has a tendency to pill otherwise
terrible hyper-pigmentation from acne that usually lasts for months
the product doesn't come out easily
i call this product my little eraser.
mind you this is one of my lazy days where i don’t even bother to do my hair
this stuff doesnt contain hexapeptide which is the skin brightener in murad
after im done with the murad treatment i will be using murads spot remover because i want something to brighten my skin
because it tended to make my makeup flake if i didnt let it dry amply
it also doesn't make my skin any oilier than it was to begin with
my skin has marks from every pimple i get whether i pop them or not
it's a very even lightening in tone
since i don't really have sun spots i don't know how effective it is for those
doesn't leave any residue afterwards.
i wouldn't use it as a makeup remover though
it says clearly that the product won't come off only by rinsing
one star off for it's being a little pricey
it's like doing a mask
i can only give this a 4 due to the obnoxious price
luxurious if you're into that sort of thing
usually it's a five step process.
i always remove my eye makeup
it's a cleansing balm that apparently is made with some sort of mud
doesn't have a strong odor or anything
as it's quite pricey
y in case you need to wash without running water
it took all of it off no matter how much eyelash glue
but it's pricey and i have bills.
it does smell super weird though
if you just want a quit easy cleanser or makeup remover just skip this product
just one use of it made my skin glow like no tomorrow
most other cleansers i've used were too drying or did not have enough cleansing power
i'd say it's a hint of dirt mixed with r
this product does not clog my pores or break me out
yet it removes even the most stubborn waterproof mascara
can see my makeup just melting off
i do not rinse
it isnt so hydrating that it cant be used for normal or even combo skin
it does not make my skin greasy
i wondered why it left such a greasy film on my skin
it's not too thick so it spreads beautifully.
i will like to add that just because my skin's dry doesn't mean i can put a scoop of cream on my face
you'll be amazed what still comes off
this balm is does not smell like i keep reading
to everyone who doesn't like the smell of this balm: you clearly don't realize that it is a very natural beauty product with no artificial perfumes in it
fyi: you aren't supposed to "rinse" it off
i can't rationalize buying it often
for anyone who doesn't like this cleanser
i never use balms on eyes i just don't like the feeling
didn't call for immediate application of moisturizer like other cleansers seem to do
this cleanser not only leaves my face clean
my clarisonic doesn't pick up anything after i remove this stuff with a washcloth
most cleansers leave me feeling stripped or too greasy
not greasy or stripped.
there isn't any residue
it doesn't linger once you've washed it off
does not irritate my eyes whatsoever like so many other cleansing balms do
you do not need to add water to while massaging this in to remove makeup
the greasy feeling you have when you first apply it is kind of alarming
i can't put my finger on the other scent
as i don't enjoy scrubbing makeup off my face
can't find a cleanser out there that removes it all without stripping the skin
as for smell- i can't complain, it's spa-like.
without fail my skin feels
it removes all make up, i mean all makeup.
then you didn't remove all of the cleanser
it does smell godawful so be prepared.
i didn't need to use the second moisturizer i've been applying at night to combat flakiness
doesn't linger with you
i don't like the smell
i guess it's called thermal cleansing balm because you rub the product between your fingers
it would not rinse off
i will warn that if you have sensitive eyes to maybe not use it as the orange irritated my eyes a little
this stuff has not only cleared my breakouts
if you don't you will not like the product because you'll think it leaves a greasy film on your skin which is hard to remove
you can use another face wash afterwards if you'd like
if you can swing the heavy price tag this is a beautiful balm to keep in your arsenal
if you want to treat yourself to an indulgent cleanser that smells soft
i can't believe it's more expensive than eve lom.
it does not come off simply by rinsing.
there's no greasy residue left on your face
bonus: my acne prone skin has not had any bad reactions
i would say this is a great cleansing balm to use at winter times
i usually take off my mascara first
such a shame it's so expensive otherwise i would pick it up
i. used to have wrinkles i don't anymore.
in the summer i get super oily with quite a few breakouts
not flaky at all.
a lot people writing these reviews forget that this is a cleanser not a moisturizer of course your skin might feel after using this
doesn't leave my skin too tight
the scent is just ok
i can't believe how clean my pores are
if you're wearing heavy eye makeup
i think it has good value because you don't need to use that much of it to get it to lather
it's nothing horribly uncomfortable
this is just a great basic clean for my skin it doesn't leave too dry
it helps with any future zits i might get
i chose this for my morning cleanser when i don't have any makeup to remove
it seems like it will not last that long compared to other foaming cleansers
it's a gentle cleanser, but does its job.
it doesn't leave my face feeling dried out
takes all your makeup off too!
that's a lot to say about a cleanser
that does not leave my skin tight
you don't need too much product to get a good lather
i wouldn't recommend this as a one step cleanser if you're trying to take off makeup though
definitely not an indulge the senses kind of cleanser
didn't feel this dried me out more
i've used this about 3 months now it's so gentle
just leaves my face just really good feeling no tightness squeaky clean feelings no residues i love it
doesn't really lather much
nothing to make actual experience of washing one's face anything to look forward to
they don't seem to hold up as well as the algenist cleanser
gets rid of acne too
it's so gentle but still gets my face clean.
love this product because it removes all my makeup
it gets all my makeup off unlike a lot if other cleansers i've tried
nothing a good moisturizer can't fix
even around the eye lashes where most cleansers never quite get
you only need a pea size amount to get a really good lather for the whole face
it gets alll your makeup off
with aging combination skin i wouldn't want to be without this
nor does it make it oily
this is gentle but still gets all my makeup off.
it doesn't dry my skin, but it's abit tighter.
i actually think my fine lines are disappearing
even that stubborn eye makeup
it's getting so that i regret putting on my tinted sunblock
it's nice going naked.
my general experience with them is that they dry out my skin or my face doesn't feel clean after using them
make my face feel tacky or like i still needed to wash
this is gonna be the cleanser that makes me stop buying other cleansers
i love this cleanser because mt skin doesn't feel tight after use
you only need a little amount to cleanse
have developed hard white heads that i could not get rid of
which i normally don't like being i have oily skin in the t-zone area
i wasn't sure about it since i normally use a cleanser that is a scrub as well
i dislike unnecessary chemicals that are not good for you
it's not harsh on my skin
good cleanser, easy, don't need that much to use.
no one should have to deal with zits
i find at night it doesn't take off my mufe eyeliner
with this i don't get that -my face is clean feeling because my liner is still on
now i don't wear heavy eyeliner- i'm in 40's.
seriously it's an all in once cleanser because of course it also removes all your makeup
how can other cleansers get all of the grime
i noticed when using my toner that i would see makeup on the little pad
i don't notice makeup on my pads anymore when using my toner
i can't believe how gentle it is
perfect for under makeup cause it's light
doesn't expose it to air
this stuff was not heavy or greasy
another bonus is that it doesn't make my sensitive skin break out or flare up
is never greasy or heavy
i can't smell the watermelon scent that a few people have mentioned
don't do well with creams or anything on the heavy side
it feels a bit rich going on but isn't heavy.
it does a lot for such a light feeling lotion.
revive night cream so my skin doesn't get used to either one
is not greasy or heavy
i don't need primer
i certainly don't feel like i'm sacrificing any anti-aging
you sometimes take it for grated
sometimes needing to be reminded "just stick with what works
this product has a light watermelon scent that does not irritate my skin
this is my absolute staple as i can use it in combination of any chemical or physical exfoliate without worry of irritated skin
didn't cause any irritations or breakouts either.
i like how it doesn't interfere with eye shadow or mascara
the elimination of spicy foods really put an end to my major acne flare ups
doesn't feel heavy or greasy
like their eye balm too
love the clean smell too.
anyway, this makes my face glow!
doesn't bother my sensitive skin.
tend to get discoloration if i'm not using the products
which i blame on what is called "second puberty" which usually happens in your early 30's
has started to freak out when i use creams with perfumes or any kind of irritant in them
i usually don't review moisturizers since i feel that most of them are the same
yes it makes his face shiny
everything usually makes me break out
this jar lasts quite awhile since you just need a thin layer
i can't really attest to the anti aging benefits
i my skin does seem very oily after i put this on at night
this does not irritate my skin at all
if you want more of brightening effect try the anti aging cream it works wonders
i love the way it absorbs without that greasy feeling
i don't want to use it up too fast
i feel you are never to young to start using anti-aging creams
i hate the feeling of anything greasy on my skin
i never thought i could use an "oily" product on my skin
i love the consistency of this moisturizer -- it's like whipped
doesn't leave your skin feeling greasy
i do sometimes use it for a day moisturizer
have a hard time finding a moisturizer that does what it should without leaving me greasy
it doesn't clog my pores.
i did not break out nor have rosacea flushing
it dries quickly but my skin doesn't feel greasy.
not at all greasy
it definitely holds up to it's anti aging promises
when i do get the occasional pimple it dries up
it doesn't clog more pores which means no breakouts
i am aging and wrinkles won't go away completely.
what i like about it is that my face isn't greasy when i wake up
let it kinda melt in your fingers
it goes on nice and doesn't leave my face greasy.
you can't find any other cream with these ingredients
i can't turn away
i don't usually spend over $40
t doesn't manage to hydrate through the night
maybe i just really need to slather it on during the winter drying months
not too thick like some can be
texture: a rich almost "whipped" qualityscent: like an unscented body lotionmoisture level: on a scale of 1-10 it's probably a 7or 8 depending on how much you use
as i sometimes do
usually i'm fairly "meh" about these samples
it's not at all greasy feeling
it doesn't cause breakouts
there's still about half of it left
you watch your skin transform
so many leave your skin feeling greasy
seem to take forever to absorb
if you are a person who occasionally breaks out
i usually dont break out
i did get two pimples
this creme doesn't sting at all
this one has not made me break out or made my skin oily at all
it doesn't make my skin feel oily
i don't usually bother with skincare samples since the sample is so small you can't tell if it works
it hydrates and doesn't irritate.
doesn't have any oily shine when applying.
i don't have a lot of wrinkles
i don't think i can spend that much on a moisturizer
it's not quite 2 oz
i know it's pricey
is not oily in any way
the combo guarantees perfect skin for makeup or no makeup
even though my skin is still a little oily in my t zone
sometimes i don't even need a day moisturizer to keep my skin pampered
doesn't make my skin oily or shiney through my make up
this mask doesn't feel tacky on the face.
do not mind scented products on your face
it's has a twist bottom
it's not as terrible as other tops like this since you can wipe everything off easily
it's just annoying, really.
for someone who has really oily skin i usually don't ever go for products like this
oils tend to make me break out
dries nicely- doesn't feel like you have glue on your face
it is a little of a chuck for a face mask
it does need to be used regularly depending on one's skin
i normally don't mind a nice fragrance
i really dont want to put a mask with a perfume smell to go to bed
may be because i dont drink enough water or sleep well
strong--if fragrances bother you in any way
that's not the case at all with this masque
i like how the product smells
does not feel greasy
this is the first moisture mask that doesn't make me oily
it's hydration with nothing else.
the product does smell
don't have to wash it off
doesn't have that sticky feeling.
my skintone is even
so this product many not be in many uses to me as i do use a drying cream to clear my acne
all the acne product do zip for me
in the morning there is generally nothing to wipe off
i don't find it unpleasant
don't slop it on--put on the same amount of product you would use if you were applying a regular moisturizer
the masque is light enough to not clog my pores
it just didn't help moisturize my face.
it's so easy because you use this overnight instead of your moisturizer
it does all the work for you while you sleep!
the masque does not make my skin break out
not just the surface
doesn't have a strong smell
that won't cause a break out or wear like a thick cream
so maybe if your skin isnt thirsty
who would've thought something so simple as "clean your face
it's not a natural smell by any means
doesn't feel thick or sticky while you're sleeping
it doesn't create a sticky layer over night.
it's now a staple in my regimen
it doesn't break me out or make my face oily
doesn't break out my combination acne-prone skin
i like that it is not too heavy on the skin as night time moisturizers tend to be
most moisturizers seam to wear off after so many hours like i never even put any on
i know it's not advertised as a acne product
this never feels too heavy when i apply it after washing
finding a product for all of this that didn't make me more oily or cause breakouts was hard
bought it because it says that it would help dull skin looks dewy
it's magic in a jar.
it's like a "treat yo self" for your skinthink of it as the equivalent of taking your bra off after a long day
i can't use cerave because it's too oily
i usually do not use anything else other than the dramatically moisturizer facial lotion which does the trick
products because let's face it
like it's fighting the wrinkles
i can't imagine myself ever getting a new overnight moisturizer
it's not keeping up with my sudden dryness
this doesn't smell like heavy perfume, #1.
not so rich that it's causing me to break out
it's also helped with my acne scares.
it does not set on your face in a sticky sense
makeup cannot cover it
feels good and doesn't leave me skin greasy.
i guess it soothed my skin because even though "calming acne" isn't listed as a benefit
it's true that it can cause you to break out because of it's composition
not seeing or feeling much difference in my skin i decided to cough up the extra money
my skin seriously glows in the morning when i use this product
i do get blemishes
my usual clinique moisturizer just wasn't enough.
can be a bit greasy feeling
it's light while at the same time being rich
it's not heavy or greasy
i swear my skin has less breakouts
t's nice to find a night cream that doesn't involve me waking up to really greasy skin
although it's the most expensive single item on my dresser
my face doesn't feel or look dehydrated
it doesn't make your skin greasy
you don't feel grimy either
not at all greasy
it does not feel heavy
you can surely use a thicker creme
not too greasy and works well with my retin-a.
doesn't feel oily on my skin
you may feel slight sliminess in the morning.
i would have horribly flakey skin
i like this cream because it doesnt break me out or make my face oily
it doesn't leave my face oily.
my face usually feels somewhat greasy around the t-zone area
you notice it's effects the instant you apply.
what i love about it is that i don't wake up with a face full of shine or oiliness
t doesn't leave a greasy shine to when applied
you can leave your house bare because it's so light
completely hydrates my skin without feeling greasy or anything like that
my pores no longer look ginormous
other times it can be really oily
the thing that concerns me the most is finding a moisturizer that won't break out my wishy washy skin
it's not oily when it goes on
it's perfect under any makeup
doesn't turn into an oil slick by lunch time
dont like the residue it left
i still need to rinse my face after the use because i feel some residues on it
try simple and kenzoki if you want to mix it up.
there's a film/tackiness/sticky feeling after using it
don't want to wash my face
it does leave a sticky feeling after using
i've noticed that my skin would easily get oily throughout the day whenever i used this
i think it's because i'm using too much on my cotton pads for my eye area
this does not irritate my skin or eyes
best of all it doesn't irritate my eyes or skin.
it's very good at removing makeup
it doesn't irritate my very irritable skin
it's a great makeup remover without being oily.
it does not have a perfume smell to it at all.
not only does it removes makeup
i don't use this to remove my face makeup
doesn't leave your face with that raw feeling
doesn't have a strong smell.
the smell is definitely a minus as it smells like cheap
t takes me much time to get used to that pump without spattering around
*yuck* its hard not to splash some on your mouth.
this product takes my makeup off so quick
i usually remove my makeup when i get home
which i wasn't expecting for a cleanser water
it's great on sensitive skin- no feeling of residue on skin
however, i can't get past the soapy smell.
this gets all of your makeup
tones when you feel lazy to do the whole routine
it doesn't take a lot to remove my makeup.
for the nights when i'm in a lazy mood
don't feel like going to the bathroom to use my normal cleanser
for basic daily office "look like i'm not wearing anything" makeup i will usually require 2 cotton pads
i can't have anything too oily cause it feels like i'll never get it completely wiped off
when i don't want to use my face wash
i hate the taste it leaves in mouth when i take off my lipstick
i don't want to rub oil into my eyes
while i can't compare this to other cleansing waters
it doesn't leave a sticky residue or otherwise feel gross on my skin
removes makeup really well without irritating my skin
for a product that is pretty useless
never has a makeup remover gotten rid of all of my makeup
i don't feel a residue.
it doesn't have a greasy feel or leave any residue
it's great at removing everything from waterproof mascara to full coverage foundation
it's not oily like other eye makeup removers
he felt that slight tingle that makes your face feel like you have little scrubbers in each pore
an even tone to my skin
it easily takes off just about everything with the exception of some lip stains
it doesn't dry out my skin or make me breakout.
it can sting your eyes, so be careful.
i love that it's no rinse
it's so light on my face
it's even safe to use on eye make-up
it's non-greasy yet it takes off my waterproof mascara
because it's not oily at all
it seems to find makeup that my face wash
when i have my lazy nights i usually use face wipes to wipe off my makeup
so you could use your makeup eraser or a micro cloth to save on that aspect
i wear a lot of makeup
i usually break out when using face washes or make up removers
like it's super power to get rid of the makeup
if you're using this as makeup remover than of course you have to wash your face afterwards
if you're simply using this to cleanse before makeup i have never noticed a greasy feel
i don't recommend it for eye makeup
as it's not effective on mascara
i don't like oil in makeover remover so decided to try this
annoying like some other eye creams i've tried
this one's also great as a base for the concealer that i apply over my dark circles
i can't say it actually brightens my eyes or makes my eye bags less puffy though
doesn't leave the skin greasy
did not alter my eye makeup or concealer
since i don't wear makeup on my face/skin
why it's so shimmery though because i'm just going to put makeup on top of it
if you don't put makeup on then that part of your face is clearly shiny
my eyes weren't as puffy or dark as they always are
it doesn't smell bad
the scent is not bad
this little cream in a jar does that!
mainly for people just starting out into more skin care items or those that just want a simple eye cream to hydrate
it's made a big difference in his skin care routine
i like how it just disappears on my skin
doesn't make it oily or anything
what i like about this eye cream is that it won't leave my skin oily nor sticky
especially if you've been weepy
makes my under eye baggage look less depressing
i wear it everyday with or without makeup
love that's it's not heavy and easily absorbs.
i don't normally wear any type of moisturizer
those who don't typically wear an under eye moisturizer because of the greasy properties
this eye cream gives my eyes a radiance that they've never had
eye creams don't do anything for me
thinking of trying out the facial cream too.
does not sit heavy on the skin
it smells great, but it's not irritating!
does not irritate your eyes
it's all you need
i don't have any problem wearing it under makeup.
it doesn't feel heavy
i would recommend it to anyone who suffers from dark circles or puffy eyes
my eyes seem less puffy and tired.
origins ginzing refreshing eye cream is not just a some "run the mill junk
the texture isn't too tacky when you put it on
can leave me looking a little shiny
doesn't burn if i rub my eyes which was a problem with my last eye cream
i would like to see some ingredients that help to depuff or amit wrinkle
it has an awesome citrus smell that does not linger once applied
it doesn't burn or irritate my eyes at all either
it's one of the only eye creams that doesn't irritate my eyes
eye creams are usually a miss for me.
is very light doesn't leave a residue
i usually don't notice a difference when using eye creams
love the grapefruit scent its not too strong where it might bother your skin
where i didn't feel the need to add concealer for highlight
i love that it's almost shimmer when i apply it on my under eyes
it's one thing for this to help the dark circles under my eye
not to mention it looks glittery on your eyes
doesn't leave a greasy mess
it's light reflexive properties are just the tip of the iceberg
be careful not to put right before makeup application because it doesn't let makeup stick to under eyes
it doesn't smell bad
i don't like switching eyes cream bc i thought it could be unnecessary
the cream doesn't irritate my sensitive skin in any way
sensitive skin abdvthis didn't make my skin feel greasy or irritate my skin
it's not too heavy
i don't usually have bags under my eyes.
for my dark circles it did nothing as mine are genetics
the one side is that it doesn't do much for when my eyes are super puffy unfortunately
i've tried so many face washes
i only have minor zits when it's near my time of month
the littlest dime-size squeeze goes such a long way because it's so frothy
it doesn't irritate it
just a small little dab of this wonder cleanser turns into a frothy mess on my face
i literally can't go a single day without this cleanser
completely stripped it of any oil so much so that my moisturizer couldn't help it
only complaint is that when i wash it off it feels sticky
it's great at removing makeup too.
after i use i don't feel dryness at all
is not foamy at all
not having any anti-ageing effects this face wash is perfect for you
sometimes my face decides to dry up in certain spots just because
doesn't dry me out, doesn't make me more oily.
don't cause an insane amount of irritation
with combo skin i find it hard to pick a cleanser that doesn't dry out my face
my face no longer gets excessively oily
i just don't prefer creams though this one lathers a bit
i can't go a morning or night without using this facewash
usually put on the ole henriksen truth serum afterwards just so my skin doesnt feel tight
it's not good at getting off waterproof mascara
it's easily become a staple to my regimen
for dryer skin types it may feel too clean
it's one of those ones that make you feel like your face is clean after using it
i got this because this was good for oily/combination skin
at first i wasn't too sure about the squeaky clean it gave
i find it gentle enough to use all over my face morning
i wouldn't say it controls my oily skin
it doesn't cause any flare ups
i've noticed it helps a lot with blackheads which i usually never notice with cleansers because i've never found one that helped
i usually get small breakouts here
other cleansers have made my skin flaky or made me break out
as i rarely get acne
my skin doesn't feel like i'm stretching it every time i move my face
it's cleansing without being overdrying
if you like these odors
you will love this face wash
it's enough to remove my makeup
removes all my makeup and doesn't break me out.
it actually helps control my acne!
doesn't try out my skin
i find this face wash makes my face feel very clean when it's washed off
i like that you can see it lather up on your skin
i notice i don't get as oily as i normally do with other cleansers
my makeup comes off cause my skin produces so much oil
the only downside is that if i use it in the shower to get my makeup off it feels like it leaves a film over my face
this is my holy grail cleanser that i can't be without
scent is not bothering my skin :
only a small amount is needed to get a nice lather
it makes my skin feel clean after without the dryness that is typical of other products i have tried
also you don't need a lot of product it lathers
it's making my face softer
it's my favourite to use when my skin is feeling blah
doesn't overdry my skin but cleans it very well
i like to use it in the shower
it's super frothy and doesn't feel harsh at all.
need to exfoliate with other methods because doesn't deep clean
doesn't seem to dry it out like a lot of cleansers do
this makes your face feel squeaky clean
you can tell it gets every little drop of makeup off your face
there's no drugstore cleanser that matches it in my opinion
how you don't need much product to wash your entire face
you only need a dab
i would recommend this combination to anyone with super oily skin
it's not good on cleaning off the make up like mascara or stain lipstick
it's left me zit free
also doesn't leave it oily feeling
its not overpowering at all
it doesn't smell weird
not oily and i didn't look greasy.
by supper time you couldn't even tell there had been a blemish
usually don't believe in spot treatments
even makes some small ones completely disappear
t does burn a little
do not rub all over your face!
it gets rid of my acne really fast i just wish it didn't burn or dry my skin out
i got it for occasional blemishes
it's really only effective when it the zit is still forming or it's just an oil pocket under the skin
i usually use it on the pimples
although it has never completely gotten rid of my pimples
which sucks for a pimple that hasn't gone away immediately
've been using a lot of treatments to get rid of my pimples
it's been my go to anytime i feel a pimple coming or have a zit
it doesn't get rid of them completely
now, i don't have crazy acne.
i just get the occasional pimple because of my period or because of a certain product i put on my face
i think it's great to use on pimples
i am not sure how if it will work on cystic acne
it does sting a bit
it says to wash the area thoroughly anyway
if it burns your skin it's working
you don't need a lot for each blemish so for me it lasts a reasonable amount of time
it seriously makes bad acne disappear so so so quickly
maybe if you have super dry skin you should try it before you buy it
it's totally worth it for the bad zits you may have
after that the skin is perfect for makeup or just going to bed ^
usually takes me weeks to get rid of pimples
i know it's working because after my cleansing/toning routine i apply some of the gel on
so while you're healing
not as tempting to pick at
i don't have bad acne
stubborn pimples that all pop up here
that's probably because they're selling miracle juice in a bottle
it's very easy to squeeze out without wasting any product
however it's nothing moisturizer can't fix the next morning
it's almost like a liquid b
i really have to blend it into my skin otherwise you can actually see the spots with the product after applying makeup causing my makeup to look patchy
it does tend to give off a burning/itchy sensation where ever you put it
i also really like that it doesn't dry my skin out after using it
although it's taking a while
as i'm someone who has a compulsion to pick/pop
doesn't feel as harsh
i try to use it only on pimples
i usually moisturize before putting it on to protect my skin too
when you apply this to the pimple
you can see the pimple becomes so small
it doesn't get rid of it completely--will take a few uses for me--
doesn't work very well on just regular blemishes
the pimples tend to be big
this is the only spot remover that does the job
would give it 5 stars put the packaging is a little annoying
even though it comes in a tiny bottle you don't need a lot of product to see results
i've never come across anything that got rid of deep pimples as well as this does
still had these stubborn pimples that would not go away
none of them could clear up a pimple as fast as this stuff
it's been less irritating
it feels like it's just sucking out all the impurities
its normal just dont forget to moisturize
when i break out its usually due to what i eat or hormones
this stuff literally got rid of my acne in 1 day!
yes it's quite expensive for the size of the container it comes in
it's concentrated so you don't need much
now i use it just for the odd pimple that pops up
i still get occasional pimples whenever its the time of the month
whenever i have little bumps or pimples i just dap a little of this on them after my night routine
because this product will irritate your skin a lot
this does not have a watery consistency at all.
i can't speak to anti-aging
i am also prone to some occasional acne if i use a heavier moisturizer
you don't need much to cover your entire face.
it doesn't make me break out even though i'm acne-prone
not greasy or heavy.
although it's thick it won't leave your skin feeling greasy or heavy
no dullness at all
feels light, stays dewy and doesn't clog pores.
it didn't do more than beyond hydrating my skin
forgot about the smell
it is not too heavy or greasy
it can be used under makeup without feeling heavy or greasy
normally it's the other way around where i go to bed with soft skin
if you feel greasy, you've used too much.
it's also been great during the spring months as it's not overwhelming or too greasy
doesn't get oily until late afternoon
my skin feels like it can breath
i found it is too oily for me to wear under my makeup during the day
doesn't make me oily
this product does not irritate my skin at all
i really like how it's not heavy and greasy.
it may seem like it's expensive
it's like a cushion for your skin!
it wasn't oily but was very fluid all the same.
i don't normally break out or have acne prone skin
you want this between the air and your skin.
it is kind of like rosacea without the little pimple-like bumps that will sometimes accompany the condition
i cannot say enough good things about white tea skin guardian
it's quite pricey if you think of adding it to your beauty regimen
a dab, seriously, that's it!
it's supposed to protect your skin from the outside world
gives it a light 'protective layer' that you can't feel once it sinks in
it doesn't take long to sink into your skin
it's not heavy once it's applied.
my skin just looked dull
if i could describe the smell of this cream in one word it would be "creamsicle"
it's a very rich moisturizer that does feel a bit heavy going on
i love how it's thick
doesn't feel heavy on the skin
doesn't make my face feel greasy when i wake up in the morning
usually my skin looks blah when i wake up
this is one of the few night creams i've used that doesn't make my eyes water
this is for bed time so the oily consistency shouldn't be a problem considering it does wonders for your skin
it doesn't skin in 100%
definitely just for nighttime use because it can make your face look a bit shiny
the only problem i find is that it can make my t zone a little shiny
i can't stop touching my face it's so smooth
the silkiness of my skin will make me use it forever
it's been wreaking havoc on my skin
it's thick yet lightweight
the essential oils don't bother me whatsoever
this doesn't feel heavy or oily at all
it's amazing for the rest of face
i really like this night cream because it's not super heavy
keeps my face matte all.dang.day!
the smell is awesome, doesn't feel oily or heavy.
it's a must have in my skin routine!
have trouble findin a good night cream that does the job without causing breakouts
it's also not greasy
doesn't leave a sticky residual feeling on my face
this night cream does wonders on my skin!
even though it's meant for the evening i use it in the day time because it doesn't make my face look oily
i forget to use it some nights
does not feel heavy on my skin
i don't have wrinkles yet!!!
which most of the time if the product is heavy it will leave me feeling oily
doesn't irritate it or break me out
doesn't make my face break out
doesn't give me a headache
not greasy at all
i can't believe how fast my pigmentation from damage is going away
i don't feel i have compromised my skin look or treatment using this
it isn't sticky or tacky.
although it will seem greasy putting it on
i don't feel oily after using it
yet my oily t-zone doesn't feel greasy
if you don't like the feeling of a thick cream you wont like this
this cream doesn't feel heavy at all
i don't have bad acne
does not clog my pores
it helps to fully clear the skin of any zits you can't quite see
indulge in a night cream like this since you're producing less oil while you sleep anyway
my face doesn't get irritated as easily as it usually does
that means i like to keep my routine simple.
it doesn't make me feel greasy or like there is a film on my dace
it's smells good too like oranges
it doesn't feel heavy.
it doesn't foam up like the checks
this is the only one that works for me it's my holy grail
it wont dry out , but gives a nice cleanse.
just give yourself the pleasure of soft feeling after washing your face with this
i find that this cleans really well without stripping the skin
i usually prefer exfoliators
know it wasn't just pregnancy hormones showing my skin love
it will burn your eyes
other than that it makes my face feel clean with some lather
as a girl with sensitive skin i'm always on the lookout for good cleansers that won't decimate my face
nor did it irritate it like other face washes have in the past
anytime i stray from it my skin suffers
only cleanser that cleans well enough that i don't need a makeup remover first
i don't get acne
product doesn't leave a tacky film after being rinsed away
it does irritate or "sting" my eyes a bit
it's fine on my face
i give it 4 stars because the only thing it can't do is clear up hormonal breakouts
it does not remove long wear makeup
yet it removes all my makeup
i like the fact that it does not leave my face with a filmy residue
i can tell it works because when i'm lazy
i won't buy another face wash.
the only down side is that with my clairsonic the cleanser tends to drip down to my eyes making it sting like crazy
i don't wear much make up
even though you shouldn't by skin care based on scent this is really lovely
it's not a ~bad~ scent, but it is very potent.
i don't remember past tubes smelling the same
it doesn't leave that uncomfortable tight feeling after it rinses
whether it's summer or winter
doesn't leave your skin feeling tight
doesn't leave my skin tight
this doesn't hurt my skin
the only negatives to this product is it doesn't lather as nice as checks
i love that this doesn't sting my eyes too badly if i accidentally get any in my eyes
it's not ridiculously priced like some of its competitors
makes me feel a teeny bit less guilty about using silicone based foundation in the first place
i love that a dab will do you!
just because i'm such a product junkie
it's strong enough to wash off my makeup without sacrificing the moisture in my skin
not sure if it's the smell of white tea
it doesn't smell bad or anything
the only reason that i can't give this five stars is because i feel like it pulls most of the moisture from my skin
my cheeks aren't red anymore
i don't have areas of small breakouts anymore
it does burn my eyes more than any face wash i've used
it stings a little if you get it in your eyes
my skin didn't feel too greasy
have had maybe one or 2 pimples since
it has a really great lather so you only need a pea size amount which is nice because it's more than i would typically spend on a cleanser
i can't speak to it's age preventing properties
i will say that it foams up nicely
it's a little too watery compare to the check
it doesn't irritate my skin either it reminds me of the glamglow mud mask
i can totally tell that's it's helped with the redness along with the active pimples seem to be smaller too
only bad thing is that it clogs everything
i love using this mask to spot treat my breakouts or to do my t-zone when it's feeling oily
it also gets rid of blemishes really quick.
my oily / combo skin has never looked better!
my acne doesn't get worse
what i love about this masque is that you can actually feel the charcoal absorbing the oil on your face
i would reccomend this mask young or old for those who struggle with blackheads
while it doesn't pull out blackheads
it's not a peel off mask
i find that this mask is wayyyy too drying when used all over my face
i recommend buying this for anyone who deals with oily skin
it's tough for me to not use this everyday--make sure you wipe it off/rub it off with a wet washcloth to get all of the bits off your face for best results
does seem to clear pores a bit.
blackhead strips do not compare to this amazon mask
it does clear out my dirty pores
i don't even think this shrinks the pores.
even though it's not an exfoliating mask
i don't really notice any of my acne disappearing
it didn't lighten dark spots
i skip some parts of my face where clogged pores are not a problem
you'll still see skin underneath
it's super easy to wash off after it dries
doesn't make my skin feel tight
this product does not irritate my skin
i usually like to use glamglow for my pores
you can quite literally feel the mask cleaning your pores
however you can do this if you are trying to dry out a large pimple
it's definitely not as drying as a clay or mud mask
i don't have that many blackheads to begin with
all you need is a thin layer of this stuff
i swear i could feel this mask pulling the dirt
bad acne for a year now
i put it on thick enough that you can't see my skin tone underneath
this is not irritating
alone product to clear acne you'll need something topical stronger
this mask doesn't do much for blackheads.
i couldn't believe my eyes after using this mask.
usually it's nearly impossible to get my blackheads out
this stuff seems like a blackhead magnet
not my favourite mask to use.
it's not harsh on the skin at all:
even though i prefer peel off masks
just make sure you apply moisturizer like your life depends on it
nothing a little moisturizer couldn't fix
it's great for those with occasional pimples
i wouldn't recommend it for cystic acne because it can make you break out to the point it's not worth it
t can make very very oily people break out bad
it's good for clearing skin for normal type people
when i have a breakout i slather my face with this stuff
is also makes for a great spot treatment when you need to get rid of a pesky zit before a night out
i'll slap this stuff on
then mother nature comes to remind me i'm human
it doesn't really dry me out
i can't believe how bright my face looks after!
my face normally if i go out gets oily
i would normally feel like i applied cement
it's not going to remove every single blackhead you have
i would definitely recommend this to anyone with clogged pores or acne prone skin
you can't beat this eye cream at the price point.
this cream doesn't feel too heavy
the cream is not too thick either
probably from a mix of lack of sleep
you'll have a smooth under-eye by the end of your routine
i find that they are too oily for my skin
this moisturizer doesn't cause any irritation
my skin does look
personally i wouldn't use it as a night eye cream because it's on the light side
when i wake up in the morning i can't believe how soft
for me this is not too thick or greasy.
this one is nice but it's so thick by comparison.
it does sink in
i certainly don't have any dryness after using
sadly everything ether only helped with the irritation or it made my eyes burn
it's now day 4 using this
starting to wear under eye concealer daily when i normally wouldn't have to
i get incredibly bad eczema flare ups on my eye lids
or whatever it's called
i also does not sting at all if you get any product to close to your waterline or in your eye
use a q tip for application so you don't end up taking too much
was not sticky at all
it has a light cream texture that is not so thick that it is hard to rub in
my previous caudalie sos eye cream was not hydrating enough
this eye cream is amazing its very long lasting it's allows any conclear to glide on
it doesn't make it look cakey
it's not sticky like the ones i previously used.
i would say its on the non-oily side
it does not always help combat puffiness
besides the fact that it's made without a lot of harsh chemicals
even sometimes mid day over my makeup
this eye cream does not.
not greasy enough to interfere with makeup
doesn't irritate or give that "stinging" feeling
i don't think it has made my puffy under eye areas any less puffy
does not burn my eyes as other eye creams have.
a little speck of product is all you need
not so thick that it's greasy
which is great for days when you don't have time to wait for your moisturizers/primers to dry before putting on makeup
didn't really need to use eye cream frequently
don't expect it to do anything for your dark cycles/ eye bags
does not irritate my eyes
this cream isn't what you want if you want anti wrinkle
you'll get great moisture
i wanted a light weight eye cream that isn't on the pricey side
had to wear a really thick full coverage concealer which would not spread at all on my skin
i even usually wear it under my sheer concealer
i can't say much about its anti-aging effects as i'm not at an age to worry about wrinkles
does not feel greasy
it doesn't feel too heavy
doesn't sting, no offensive scent.
i find that there's no smell and it's very light.
it doesn't smooth out my laugh lines as much as other creams though
i didn't have an allergic reaction
even got rid of my milia
doesn't sting or burn.
it doesn't have an overwhelming scent which is always a plus for me
i don't see any difference with my dark circles
the formula isn't irritating
you don't need much product to get your face totally clean
i think it's more of a clean your face from dust
i can finally wear dewey foundations without having to worry if i will be an oil slick
so it's made me feel ugly!
it also doesn't leave your skin feeling oily or tight
crunchy which happens sometimes with a no oil cleanser
you don't need a lot of the cleanser
it's a part of regular face routine.
this cleanser lasts for a really long time
smells a little strange though, but it isn't bad.
it's not a harsh cleanser which is perfect because it won't irritate your skin if you have sensitive or acne prone skin
i don't ever get big pimples
it got rid of all my acne after having serious reactions to so many products
don't get too oily during the day
i would definitely recommend to not forget to moisturize your skin after using this
does not leave any residue on my skin
as this cleanser doesn't overdry my skin at all
the oil-free effect doesn't last all day though
that doesn't irritate my skin
really recommend this product if you have problem acne with combo skin
also doesn't make it oily either
doesn't leave that tight feeling
doesn't seem to help with deep under the skin acne
it does remove the makeup
use wear to get into a more foam kind of cleanser
i really like this formula i have oily skin
otherwise i would've gave this product 5 stars
-i love how it doesn't have any harsh chemicals-it decloggs your pores without leaving your face completely dry
doesn't strip away the oils
this cleanser does just that!!!
doesn't give you that tight feeling on your face after use
i can't say i've noticed it clearing any acne
it also doesn't cause any breakouts so that's a bonus over other cleansers
i like the cleanser enough to overlook it
i find this product is the best for getting squeaky clean face
i feel like no other cleanser scrubs
i would recommend this to anyone who has normal/ combination or oily skin
no kind of primer or setting spray/powder could help my makeup not slide around or kind of melt off
it's made a big difference
it's made with a bunch of chemicals
my skin never feels tight or greasy after usage.
u definitely need more than just this face wash to really combat oiliness
this product doesn't aggravate my skin
it doesn't do a thing towards fighting breakouts.
it suds up very easily
it will burn your eyes as i said lol i used a makeup remover face wash
not only does this reduce shine all day
i wouldn't say i'm too oily
this cleanser will burn yours eyes so after showering i have red eyes which i really hate about this product
i would definitely recommend this to anyone struggling with oily skin
noticed that after 2 weeks my skin is definitely not as oily
not a bad face cleanser
doesn't leave my face feeling tight
you can tell it cleans deep
it doesn't control my oil like it claims.
it did cause my acne prone areas to purge a bit
it doesn't leave my skin tight afterwards either
i completely forgot my "no zit sherlock" cleanser
i think i'm going to get rid of "no zit
my pores almost look nonexistant
i don't use this everyday
does really suck the gunk out.
it's the only thing that doesn't make me feel greasy
origins is one of the only lines i've found that doesn't irritate my skin
does wonders for my acne-prone
it's great at controlling my oily t-zone without drying out my skin
it's a great way to get rid of that acne without drying you out like proactiv
i didn't have an extreme improvement in my oil until i started using smashbox anti-shine
i wouldn't say it's super hydrating
whenever i want some extra moisture
then i simply rinse with cool water
this face mask feels like it's melting when i put it on
it must have oils in it because even when you wash it off it still feels like it's on your skin
if you don't like strong scents you won't like this
i don't use it often
i love the cream texture because i could see that my skin was drinking it up
i don't feel that my skin gets oily after i wash it off
not at all irritating
i love how it melts into the skin
that makes sense given it's supposed to be a mask
the thing i possibly hate most in life is when you moisturize
doesn't make it oily during day time
not only does it smell so good it moisturizes my face
my face doesn't look greasy in the morning
does not leave any greasy residue
my face doesn't get as shiny throughout the day
it didn't make my face look filmy after
when i put more it's essentially useless
i do not feel thick or heavy to my skin
so that it's not as heavy
you can use this as a mask
i really like slathering it on
recommended to try this first as it wasn't as expensive as say the glam glow
love that you don't even need to wash it off
it doesn't irritate my oily acne prone skin huge plus for me
once i wash it off i can't believe my skin feels so good
not wash it off- sometimes wearing it to bed
i love it's free of all kinds of harsh ingredients
its thick enough to stay on your face without dripping or anything
i love this to use it before i put on my makeups.
it does the trick without causing any irritations
it's pretty cheap too.
i like how light the mask is
this mask provides the right amount of hydration so my skin doesn't feel tight yet doesn't break me out
you can either wipe it off or rinse it off
it doesn't give that hydration sensation if you have really dry skin it will burn a little that means that its working
it does feel greasy when its on
not greasy at all
it kind of just soaks into your skin the longer you leave it on
i don't feel like it's an overpowering smell
i only give it 4 stars though because it's a pretty small tube for the price
so does the lips.
shouldn't have an elasticity problem
bad that it looks like i have a terrible sun burn that is making my face peel
you really just need a thin layer
it's not so much a mask as it is just a thick lotion
there's no excess to make me oily
keeps me from getting as oily as i usually do
as my old lotions just weren't cutting it
it doesn't feel heavy at all
i don't like jar packaging because it exposes all the products
makeup won't glide on easilyi have never found a product with this much pros in my life
i don't necessarily have oily skin
my skin would be so shiny and feel gross.
i does not leave an oil residue on my face
my skin does not look shiny as all
yet afraid of products feeling heavy on the face
which doesn't make you feel as though you've just sprayed an entire bottle of perfume on your face
even though this product says it's for oily skin
because it's not 100% oil free
the oils it does have are good for any type skin
unfortunately they don't make it in a squeeze tube
i would say both feel the same on the skin--they aren't tacky
apparently, it's good for all seasons
thankfully this does the trick.
i may never wear any foundation with a dewy or glowy look
my skin is not even close to being oily
i don't wear makeup to work because i work so early
i don't see an issue slapping a primer
everyday i have to touch up on my makeup because my skin gets so oily
this product really does stop my skin from getting oily
when i mean i have acne-prone skin
make up forever mattifying primer
it feels so light and non greasy on the skin.
that the bottle isn't that big
i don't even wear makeup because it makes it worse
this moisturizer really does cut the oil production down majorly
i am not qreasy or shiny at all
doesn't leave my skin super shiny a 30 minutes later
i don't think i'd recommend it for combination skin
i did notice when wearing this product alone to sleep i do not wake up as oily
i would definitely recommend this to anyone with oily skin
the first few days i didn't notice much change in my oily skin
the smell is a bonus too!
even if i use primer
it is not greasy at all
it does not make my face greasy
can't really say it has resulted in a refined texture or a smooth finish
it's the perfect super light weight for when i need some extra moisture
moisture lotions that doesn't make my eyes puff up
i can wear it under my makeup
it doesn't make me oily
i can't feel it on my skin at all
t starts to get a little shiny after that
it doesn't necessarily get rid of oil
does not leave nasty residue.
oil free which is perfect for oily skin it's really not too heavy like other moisturizers b/c it is kind of liquidly
it is a light moisturizer that does not make my face feel like an oil slick
doesn't leave my face shiny
hates to wear anything on his face
it is not greasy at all
this product is not greasy
it cools your skin upon application because there's mint in it
one downside i've experienced is that it doesn't leave a matte finish
i find that within about 3 hours my face is somewhat oily
my t-zone is really the only oily place
i love what it does for my combination/acne-prone skin
the only slightly annoying thing about this mask is that it does smell really mentholated
everything that i was using irritating my skin.
angry pimples i seem to get around that time of the month
my skin didn't look or feel oily at all
if you get bad breakouts, you need this.
it's not a cure-all.
i reach for this when i'm having super rough skin days because i know it won't irritate
i don't break out too often
anytime i feel an under the skin pimple forming i put some of the mask on the area or areas
when it's time to rinse
i love this it's not harsh or drying
i like that it's gentle enough to use frequently
they seem to just lurk under the surface of my skin
especially if i have worn heavy makeup that has caused me to break out
it's just not cutting it
doesn't irritate my skin at all
it didn't take much oil from my pores
it's complete trash compared to this mask
anytime i feel a zit coming on
during bad breakouts i even use it daily
i do think it helps with redness.
it's the only clay mask that doesn't suck the life out of my skin
unless you're oily everywhere i would just apply where needed as it can be a bit drying
although i only use it when i notice pimples
it's even better for just your pimples to apply over night it just dries them out in going to end up buying the full size
you don't notice it after it's on
i feel like after 2 uses the pimple actually starts to go away
it does have an odd smell that lingers for awhile on your face
i only apply it to my pimple spots
would definitely recommend if you have acne prone skin
this mask is a good one for acne-prone
my only complaint would be to make sure to not use it too often or it can dry out your skin
i like to use it when i can see a pimple about to come out
one thing for sure is it may dry your skin out if you leave it on for too long
i sometimes leave it on as a spot treatment all night to help with pimples
i do recommend to not use this every day as it can dry out your skin
when i used to have bad acne
it smells and feels like medicine on your face.
t was a little embarrassing to have blemishes like that
the only con is that it smells odd
it's not a bad smell
it won't magically clear up all of your acne over night
it works well with those zits that are about to surface
it won't clear your acne.
it is quick, easy, and not messy.
it doens't dry my skin out like a lot of the other masks for problem skin
this mask does wonders for my skin
my acne is not magically gone
it doesn't smell good at all
just smells like medicine
this does not cause any burning or irritation at all
however it does have a smell that reminds me of some calcimine lotion or something
the smell doesn't bother me because it reminds me of my childhood
makes your skin feel a little hot while it is on
this mask really does rescue your skin.
it tends to linger even after you've washed your face
or my skin seems irritated i use this
i don't normally get under the skin
even though it's probably my skin purging/getting used to all of the new stuff
it works great as a mask or sometimes i use it as a spot treatment
it doesn't *poof* make everything disappear
it makes them pimples take a chill pill until my hormones quit trying to ruin my life
it didn't irritate my skin
your acne won't disappear
no you aren't having an allergic reaction
you may also see that your skin is less oily
don't have to apply lotion as i usually do after washing my face
as a rogue member with hormonal acne i can tell you i have tried the gambit
since it's so quick its really easy to put on in the morning while brushing your teeth or something
my skin doesn't feel too dry
it's done wonders under my makeup
it doesn't irritate me at all.
it doesn't work too well for my skin type
it does not leave your face sticky or have that dry weird feeling after you apply it
i find that you don't need even close to the full squirt your given
because it is a black moisturizer it's best to use little or none at all in the morning as it does have a ashy look
which i find can sometimes dispense too much product
delivers enough hydration to where i don't feel oily whatsoever in the morning
the black also disappears into nothing unless you don't moisturize it into your face enough
which was rare because i don't like how it wears under any of my foundations
i've never gone through a moisturizing product that quickly before- i couldn't even time it because the jar is completely opaque
it's hard to find a good moisturizer that doesn't break you out so easily
it doesn't smell bad
the t dryer it's not oily at all
i actually like the scent
it doesn't irritate my skin at all like most products with fragrances do
i got nervous thinking it would leave a tint or the shimmer would either irritate or be too 'sparkly'
it's actually decreased the amount of makeup i use
only on the areas that tend to get pink for me
manages to not be too overpowering on oily skin
it's lightweight and not sticky.
after trying many moisturizers that were not hydrating enough or too greasy-feeling
someone had mentioned that there's actually less than 1 oz of moisturizer if you removed it all from the jar
doesn't leave any sticky residue
i like when i don't feel the presence of my moisturizer on my face after i apply it
this really does make your pores appear smaller
i do not like the packaging because i feel like i sometimes over push the amount of product out to the surface
doesn't leave any black cast
can't wait to try the rest of the charcoal line.
although it doesn't seem to have done much to my poor blackhead-ridden nose it definitely has improved the look of pores on my cheeks
i alway dreaded putting moisterizer on my clean face not any more
i generally have an oily t zone
not make me too oily or break out
other moisturizers sometimes feel heavy on the face
just a light layer will do
i never get greasy
if you don't want a heavy cream this may be enough
it does feel weird rubbing a black product into my skin
not greasy at all!
i would only recommend this for oily or combo skin though because it is lightweight
anyone with acne knows it's hard to balance keeping your skin from being too oily then the products to keep the oil away can dry you out so much that your skin is flaky
i can see a difference in my skin texture.
it can really dry skin if you don't use another moisturizer
it's completely gotten rid of my hormonal acne
i like that it is not at all oily
n will buy there other stuff they have i've only used there minimizing pores black bottles n i'm in love with them hope it works for others too
it does not create shininess like other products will
doesn't leave any sort of greasy feeling
this stuff soaks up all the oil out of my skin
it will work wonders on your skin
the packaging just annoys me
i swear there is more product in the jar somewhere
i can't even see the pores on my cheeks anymore
anything else in your pours
it doesn't leave my combo skin oily or dry.
the way the moisturizer is dispensed is kind of annoying
i don't think anything will really solve my oily skin
it manages to consistently provide the right amount of moisture without leaving your face feeling greasy nor heavy creamed
i feel like it's more of a heating gel
doesn't leave a sticky residue like a lot of moisturizers do
so don't glob this onto your face
not only does it do this but it hydrates my skin.
i love this moisturizer because it's fast-absorbing
i couldn't use eyeliner anymore without making it worse
while my wrinkles won't disappear-no cream will do this-my eye area looks better
it doesn't give me the look that concealer would
it's like i put a facetune filter under my under eyes
it doesn't have a silicone texture because well
eye creams are a tricky product as you don't normally see results immediately as you would with something like a serum
i usually struggle to find an eye cream which would well moisture skin under my eyes as it suffers from dryness rather then anything else
does it get rid of my lines?
the best thing about this eye cream is that it doesn't irritate my eyes
doesn't sting like so many other eye creams do
it doesn't have a scent
i do not have any wrinkles/fine lines
i don't wrinkles really
i don't have dark circles
it was hard to find one that didn't irritate my sensitive skin or make me break out
i've had a hard time finding eye creams that don't bother my sensitive eyes or sting my skin
doesn't make my eyes tear up or sting
i think it's well priced for a quality eye cream
can't comment on how it works on wrinkles
i don't find it to be greasy at all.
this is the first eye cream that doesn't sting my eyes
feels great on my skin because it's not too thick
ok so this is an anti-aging eye cream
it gives my eyes the moisture that my overall face moisturizer can't
it doesn't provide quite enough moisture to use on its own
the product does not irritate my eyes
sometimes when it's been a long day
make a mess of your makeup
the price isn't bad when you compare it to other eye creams out there
it goes on so lightly
dont notice as much redness or dark circles
while i don't have many wrinkles to speak of
i do notice a little burning
although i don't have wrinkles around my eyes yet
i can't speak to it's anti-aging power
it doesn't irritate my eyes like most do
although nothing is a miracle in a jar
it does nothing for dark circles
doesn't do much for my dark circles.
i can wear this every day without feeling like i slathered something greasy around my eyes
it's not irritating either!
sometimes there is nothing i can do about mother nature altering her time line
some products are too harsh to use on your eyelid or above your eye
the cream does not migrate into your eyes
a lot of creams cause my eyes to look soooo swollen in the morning
it's made my skin look firmer and tighter.
if you like a strong peel, get these!
half a pad is enough to do the face
i feel no burning or irritation.
no gimmicks, no fragrance, just results.
regardless of your skin type this is great to just wipe over your face after washing before moisturizing to remove whatever the cleanser didn't get
do yourself & your skin a favor!
if you suffer from hormonal breakouts or texture due to congestion i implore you to try this
less time for me to wait to add my moisturizer
i know this is mostly from the silicone
it almost feels like some primers because of the "slip factor" it has
for me it's even better than the essence lotions
not oily, but more so than the spot corrector
it doesn't make my skin shiny or breakout.
now i don't even have to wear makeup
it's a huge plus that it is oil-free
t does not feel greasy or clog my pores
doesn't weigh down my skin
i know that there's a clinique product that's more geared towards this problem
i really don't have wrinkles
okay i used to have dull looking skin
it lays nice under a moisturizer however don't expect anything life changing
my skin looks even
i will say that it's gentle
it almost feels like some primers because of the "slip factor" it has
i don't want it to smell like plastic
it doesn't make my skin oily
not sure is this would work for people with oily skin
the cream doesn't sit on top of my skin either which i hate
none of them were hydrating enough until this one
7 oz that i usually get lasts me good 5-6 months
it's not sticky and the smell is just fine.
does not cause me to break out on my acne problem skin
almost didn't have to apply a moisturizer because my skin felt so smooth
which is why its a good thing that it doesn't absorb into the skin right away
it does make my skin very tacky until it absorbs into the skin
does wear well under makeup
it's the perfect base for my makeup routine
does leave me a little dewy to start
i don't find it to be sticky
nor do i find that it leaves my skin with any sort of oily feeling
i don't think it's too heavy for daytime wear underneath makeup
what i do is i use the 7 day scrub by clinique
i stop itching as soon as i lather my face in this stuff
might be too thick to moisturize before makeup as it takes a bit it set in
annoying flakey patches of skin that are so tough to get rid of
i don't find it overpowering at all
the scent of this is not.
its not overpowering it's just a faint presence
i just don't like the smell.
it just has a strange chemical smell that i find unpleasant
get maybe 4-6 pimples per year
i can see how some might find it too "greasy" if you are predisposed to naturally produce oil
you can even apply it over your makeup
it's very thick, you just need a small amount.
even acts as a pore minimizer in my opinion
a must have even if you think you are oily or greasy
it's great because it didn't clog my pores or cause any breakouts
yes it has a tacky-sticky feel
i can still apply foundation over the tackiness flawlessly so really it's not an issue unless you have to touch your face
does not leave skin feeling oily
wwait a little bit before applying make up after you've out this in do it has a chance to getabsorbedd by your skin
this cream does the trick for me
my skin just sucks it up
absolutely love that it doesn't leave an oily residue or make my skin feel greasy
nothing else calms them for day use like this moisturizer
it is a little sticky like people say
was a bit too oily for day time use
night when you need lots of moisture to your face
my regular moisturizer everywhere else
don't wear it under makeup
it's not greasy or oily
i never knew that's for people with oily skin
i left off one star because it's a little pricey.
it isn't at all greasy, soaks right in.
it was not heavy or greasy
not only did it hydrate my skin after one use
you shouldn't use any other moisturizer
it doesn't leave your skin oily like most moisturizers
this moisturizer does it's job
it can be too moist for some more oily-type ppl
the only reason for only 4 stars is that is doesn't always play nice with other toners can make you greasy if its not the right combination
now it's a staple in my everyday beauty routine
it doesn't have a scent.
unfortunately he did give me clog pores in the cheek area
my skin feels like it's drinking water....no lie.
flakiness away until a bought this
it's thick without being balm like
it doesn't clog my pores
doesn't clog my pores which is my huge issue with so many intense moisturizers
it doesn't make me oily though
no more flakey skin :
defiantly something i can over look because of what wonders this dose for my skin
it doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy the next day or cause me any breakouts which i love because i have very sensitive skin
do you know how hard it is to find a cream like facial moisturizer that is oil free
literally makes my face feel like silk no lie.
this is the only one that relieves the dryness for a looong time
i hope clinique never discontinues this stuff because it's literally the best thing for my dry skin
not necessarily my everyday moisturizer
actually isn't too heavy to use under makeup
it's a must have with any beauty regime.
tired of the greasy serums that just sit there
it doesn't make more oily.
this stuff dries immediately
watery so you only need one pump to cover your face
but i couldn't stand the stickiness of most.
this also doesn't smell as strong as the murad one
i don't feel a need to use a separate wrinkle prevention cream or eye cream as this does everything
i mean it makes my skin actually puke out blackheads i have had forever
this product goes on so light and easy.
nor does it aggravate my skin
it didn't soak in well
this expensive little potion does the trick
it did seem to lessen the crepey-ness look of my eyelids
if you want instant gratification
it makes my eyelids smoother which makes it easy to apply my eyeliner
sometimes under my eyes
thus my concealer doesn't cake as much
i do not have dark circles or craw's feet.
the reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that it's not brightening or moisturizing so you still need to put face cream on top
not just on the surface
doesn't irritate the eyes
it even makes my eyeshadow stay longer.
sometimes i let it sink in
don't let it drip down
there aren't too many products that you can use on your eyelids
it literally does not need much just a dab
try this if your eyelids are showing your age.
i tried other eye creams in the hopes that they'd work
can't be without this cream
there's a lot left in that little bottle.
you can actually feel this product tingle on your lids
even though i am a skin care junkie
you'll see results from that as well
this thing actually lifts droopy/tired eyes
i hate anything that feels too greasy or heavy around my eyes
"did you just get your brows done?"
do not have to wear a heavy moisturizer
unless your skin is oily enough that it doesn't require moisturizer after application
does everything i need without making me oily
i can't use moisturizers that are too thick
still it isn't cheap
it's not too heavy
which doesn't cause me to be red
my skin tends to get shiny through the t-zone
does not make me break out or oily
this leaves my skin so soft i can't even believe.
it does not contain silicone
it's oil free so my skin loves it
most moisturizers tend to sit on top of my t-zone
making my face look like an oil slick
i can't tell if it's actually hydrating my cheeks
it's definitely not drying them out like another serum i used
t definitely gets under your skin to hydrate from within
a normal moisturizer isn't enough for my skin
doesn't leave your face greasy like some serums can
this product does not clog my pores.
it doesn't leave my face dry or red like some other cleansers do
it's gentle enough for daily use
it's really good for the oily face try it ❤️❤️
doesn't leave my skin feeling stripped
beware getting it in your eye though!
i like to use this in the morning because having combination skin my tzone gets really oily
you can't feel it if you do clean you face while taking a bath
my skin was begging for this boscia stuff
my face is not greasy at all
i don't just have combination skin
i know boscia makes a cleanser just for that
i tend to get oiler as the day goes on
it really does get warm when you rub it in your h
cleans my face well without irritating or overdrying my skin
i don't suffer from acne
while i feel like this product doesn't get particularly foamy or work up to a very goo lather
it's hard to find things that don't anger my skin
my skin gets congested soooo easily.
it doesn't ever dry my skin out to where i'm faking
don't follow up with moisturizer right away my skin isn't more oily
f your sensitive to scents you might want to find a different cleanser
it's a good product but i wasn't blown away .
it's not super soapy
i think the cleanser would work on any skin type
i feel like its shrinking my pores which im not complaining about
i don't normally suffer from acne
washes off my makeup even the waterproof stuff.
it still never got rid of my acne scars
doesn't smell too great
not to mention it's paraben free & natural.
and it's been mild enough to use every day.
it made my face actually feel clean unlike other cleansers i had tried
i didn't feel the need to moisturize
it didn't give me that squeaky clean feeling i grew to love from boscia
doesn't make my face oily nor dry.
not take away all the moisture or cause any sensitivity
i don't see my face as oily as much now
i still have shine peeking through during the day i'm also finding a good moisturizer for it other than that it's a nice cleanser
doesn't strip my skin or leave any residue
a lot of cleansers can be too harsh or clog my pores
what i don't like is that you have to use a lot to clean your face
certain cleansers make me break out
it turns grey-ish when you keep rubbing it on your face
the smell wasn't overcoming or nasty like most things on here
not only does it leave my skin feeling clean
i still think it's a fine cleanser to use when you feel like you want a deeper clean
it doesn't give my face the tight feeling after i use it
it doesn't make the skin feel stripped or squeaky clean
it doesn't really lather
this cleanser doesn't irritate it at all
use a toner to get all the product off or else it will sink in
when your start to use you can feel little hot
it is little foamy because they didn't put any harsh ingredients
i can't imagine my daily regimen without this cleanser that is like no other
my face doesn't feel dried out afterwards
usually tend to break out
it's interesting how it warms up when it contacts the face
i tend to get a little acne
if you want to treat your skin
then you'll love this oil!!!
lifting creams that i can say i see some difference
a little dab will do ya!
it's like drinking a glass of water with your face
does wonders for my skin
feel it prevents my adult acne when it's that time of the month
"i'm super paranoid about everything breaking me out
like i do sometimes even with my very oily skin
i guess it's hard to find a cream with both anti aging benefits
i rarely get acne now.
my skin is even and glowy.
didn't irritate my skin
this product you can even apply on your eyelids
if you like this cream, try the genius cream too!
i would give it 3 stars if it moisturized without causing a reaction
2 weeks in and it's working like magic.
it really does tighten saggy areas
this product does not cause an acne-prone skin person like my self
i usually get one or two pimple here
i wasn't willing to start fillers or botox yet
which it usually isn't
quick-absorbing that doesn't reek
my oh creams are just a little too heavy for warmer spring
not sure why it's so heavy compared to other products' jars
my skin doesn't crimp up now that i don't use retinol any more
there is no tacky feeling or added weight
don't care if it does a darn thing to my skin from a wrinke to firming i love the look of my skin with this on
its not greasy or heavy- i put on my minerals makeup right after applying this cream
the only minus is it doesn't smell very well.
it doesn't irritate my skin
doesn't make my face feel oily or greasy etc
there's a cushiony feeling that hasn't been there in years
it doesn't clog my pores or cause breakouts.
t does not moisturize enough
so having a moisturizer that doesn't cause more oil is a must
think of all the $$ you've already wasted trying other moisturizers that weren't up to par
not greasy at all
my skin can sometimes get kinda greasy
don't have wrinkles yet
if i don't blend it in enough then sometimes it will show near my upper cheeks
it's the best i have found for use in the morning on puffy sags
doesn't migrate into my eyes
the pump doesn't reach to the bottom of bottle
i don't have much wrinkles around my eyes nor do i have bad dark circles
my skin doesn't tolerate a lot of lotions nor oils without offering up a big clogged pore in response
my mom even thought that i was wearing concealer.
you'll see results in 10-30 minutes.
it has worked almost like a primer because i can't believe how smoothly my eyeliner goes on
it doesn't burn or tingle
it gets really sticky
i like how it's light weight
not too heavy feeling to layer on my makeup afterwards
even if you don't have any wrinkles or just bare minimum i would see the difference around my eyes
if you stop using it you will notice tthat the skin around your eyes is more pronounced than before
doesn't claim to also get rid of of dark circles
not sticky at all
i don't give 5 stars lightly
after a couple of days of pity party because the consultant said i shouldn't use eyeliner
sometimes it does seem to sting or irritate my skin a little bit
it's not all of the time which makes me think it's interacting with other face products
it's now my 'go to' eye gel.
i love that it's not tested on animals
perhaps this is just wishful thinking
though if i use eye primer i feel like there's too much "on" my skin
not so "cream" that it gives you a greasy slick
was having trouble finding a solution to combat the annoying flakiness/patchiness that appears after a couple hours of wearing foundation or bb cream
matte the only drawback is the smell it feels like i am putting a cheap perfume on my face after a few minutes the smell fades away
it does make my skin a little shiny
i like my skin to be dewy when i'm not wearing makeup so this will be good for days i don't wear makeup
it doesn't make it flare up
i think that's mostly because i don't go outside a lot nor get fresh air?
my t-zone lasts longer without getting oily
dont apply too much or your skin will have a slight balmy feel
beauty products i want a moisturizer that comes with a pump so that it isn't exposed to air
i can't see myself buying any other moisturizer.
i don't smell it
only 4 stars because this is not a mattifying product
won't be too oily
the best parts about this product is that i feel it doesn't skimp on the moisture
you're not getting shiny just hours into the day
good moisture but doesn't feel greasy!
i don't seem get oily as a result of this product
i love the fact that it doesn't feel heavy on my skin
i don't know if it's because of the moisturizer
it doesn't leave any sticky residue
maybe that's normal because i really don't use very heavy moisturizers since my skin is already oily
this is the only moisturizer that balances everything without being too light or too greasy
didn't make me more oily
didn't help the oiliness too much
there is nothing greasy about this moisturizer which i love
t doesn't feel like a greasy mess on your face
non sticky just feels right
i really like this product except for on my t zone which gets oily says its for combo to oily skin
this is light enough to feel moisturizerized without clogging my pores
i would recommend this to anyone who has oily or combo skin
the only thing that i do not like about the lotion is the fragrance it's pretty strong for a moisturizer
definitely recommend it to anyone with oily skin
i wouldn't really call myself oily even then
i hate heavy creams that make your skin feel like it's being suffocated
without feeling greasy or too heavy
isn't so thick that it makes my face feel oily after i use it
doesn't cause my acne prone skin breakouts
this product is not greasy
not perfume-like or overwhelming
i do sometimes still get a little oily late afternoon in t-zone
this product does not leave me oily
for years i've been trying to find the right moisturizer that won't leave me shiny or greasy
not be heavy or greasy
it smells like it should be a body moisturizer or that it would break me out
recently i'd say it's more oily
this moisturizer didn't do anything to lessen the oil
i don't feel greasy at all throughout the day.
low for something anything to keep me matte all day
read bout it in a blog not realizing it was for oily/combo skin ordered it
doesn't leave a greasy feel
doesn't leave an obnoxious oily shine afterwards
it's so good for your skin
does not leave me feeling greasy yet plenty of moisture
doesn't make my skin feel extra oily
it doesn't leave my skin feeling oily throughout the day
it doesn't bother my skin
it doesn't feel greasy.
doesn't appear to be aggrevated by this
it's an oily face's dream
i tend to get very oily in my t-zone
this moisturizer has helped that too because there is less oil to clog up my pores
a lot of people with oily skin dehydrate it by not giving it enough moisture which in turn makes your skin produce more oil
the moisturizer itself is not too heavy either
moisturizers tend to make me breakout if i use the same one too long
do yourself and your skin a favor and get this!!!
even at 30 causes pretty bad acne breakouts
not only does it not make me more oily
which happens w certain cremes
yes the stuff isn't cheap
it's the only product i've found that truly repairs the flakiness that results from using retinol
it's so rich that it also works as an eye cream.
she confused me so now i'm going to try the oil free vitamin face base
clinique's dramatically different moisturizer gel wasn't cutting it for me anymore
my skin doesn't feel oily
it's a must where i live in such extreme cold
all i can say is that this moisturizer gets used up
this is definately not for someone who has oily skin
i know it's pricey but one jar lasts forever.
you may not like the texture of this balm.
it even makes my pimples go away.
i've heard from other reviewers that the balm is too thick
if anyone makes a drugstore dupe of this
usually powerful creams like this make me break out
using every single thing she makes as long as it's something i need bc the price tags are a little steep
i know its not an eye cream
if i have any flaky spots on my face before applying my makeup
it does remains tacky once applied
i am still 4 hours later feeling a weird sticky dirty feeling on my skin
anything light weight doesn't help me in the winter
it's made my skin tone more even
rose scented products can smell awful if they're too strong
i'd probably scent it less or mix in some other scent
it really does remove dark spots
i think the overpowering fragrance is what caused my skin to react
the fragrance doesn't bother me at all
if you're at the dermatologist every month with little to show for it
if the beautiful rose scent isn't enough to make you want to try it then keep reading
i really don't think it's done anything to lighten my sun spots
it's even helped my complexion
thick yet it does not break you out
is not greasy at all
still amazes me how it is not oily at all yet it is so soft
i can't wait to try the eye cream because i cannot find anything to brighten my eyes
it does give you a new glow that will have you taking pictures
i didn't feel that this was irritating at all to my skin
even my skin tone
my skin is usually oily except for winter when its combo
the scent doesn't bother me
if you are sensitive to smells or do not like the smell of roses
i noticed i didn't wake up grease like i did with aqua bomd
this stuff is lightweight enough that it doesn't make my skin feel greasy
it's a nice moisturizer that doesn't feel sticky on my face when i put it on
it is simply a moisturizer that smells good.
this is a little harsh for a face cream as it gives me a head ache
it's the perfect night cream for those who can st
would recommend to anyone looking to fade acne marks
i can see it being too much for those with oily or combo skin
not so much so that its sticky or suffocating
now i will say i don't have extreme scarring
i usually get headaches from smells
it's perfected my skin
will reccomend not irritating
does have a strong rose smells that lingers i did not mind it
i can not tell if it's brightening, fading, etc.
glowy without being too greasy
if your a picky person with scents or doesn't like roses then obviously don't buy this
if you want healthy soft glowing skin then please try it
the smell is so strong that even a person from 5 feet away can smell you
say that you are wearing a perfume
while my face isn't magically perfect now
it really doesn't feel like i've slept with a facial mask on all night
a strong smelling mask then it's not for you
it did tingle a little after i applied it
i absolutely loved this mask however i don't wear it to bed because the smell of roses overwhelms me a little bit
this mask really does brighten your skin overnight
this moisturizer smells so nice when i apply it at night
i can't say if it helps with acne scars
i don't mind or find it to be overpowering
it's hard to get the product out
i really like this cleansing balmit takes off all my makeup leaving my skin soft
i can even see the natural blush.
does not leave a residue
doesn't break out my extra-sensitive skin.
it didn't irritate my skin
it comes with a cloth that i think people forget to use
it does sting a bit when you get it in your eye while trying to remove eye makeup
5 times if i'm trying to remove waterproof makeup
i love it though because it's safe to use on the eyes
not greasy when i wash my face
your skin will feel like a babies bum afterwards which is a total plus
does sting the eyes a tad
tho do be careful around eyes
the fragrance does not bother me as it smells like something out of a spa
even tho it's oil liked it doesn't feel like i have unpleasant residu or anything
it's not as foamy as i would like
in order to use this product you would take enough of the product to lather onto your skin
don't use any water
this product felt a little oily after i put it on
otherwise, this balm is amazing!
to me the only con was that it says it can remove eye makeup
it didn't really leave the oily film as other reviewers said
i don't use this everyday since i have combo skin
you'll like this product
i do not like using this cleansing balm to remove my eye make up
this product does not strip my face of any moisture
even when i don't wear make-up
fearing that it would make me oilier
nit only does my cleanser do what it's supposed to
this product is gentle enough to be used on your eyes
it doesn't get rid of all the mascara
all skin types could use this stuff!
not only does it get all the dirt out of my pores
even my eye makeup.
i love the way my skin feels once it's been rinsed off
what i didn't like about it is the peculiar odor.
the cloth that is included with the product is a bit cheesy
i hardly wear a lot of makeup
[i do think it would be nice if ren provided 2 cloths with the cleanser or sold spare cloths
it can irritate them.
who doesn't like a bit of a beauty ritual
it's pretty much the only product that is free of the dirty dozen toxic cosmetic ingredients
it's a part of my beauty philosophy to not spend a lot of money on cleansers because they only stay on the skin for a few moments
not just splash your face clean
i never use the cloth it comes with just splash
it doesn't take off all my mascara
just know it's efficacy is a bit variable when it comes to mascara
t would seem this cleansing balm would be a perfect match
even though i don't have acne
i do get the occasional breakout
can't wait to wash my face at night!
doesn't leave my skin with any oil residue
$48 felt like a steep price for a cheapo like me
i will never go back to foaming cleansers which dry you out needlessly
no matter how oily you are
it's scary at first because your skin looks so oily while you're massaging it in
doesn't leave my skin with any oil residue
i don't typically take the huge container with me because it takes up so much room in my makeup bag
the only downfall is it doesn't completely remove all of my mascara
as i use it to remove my eye makeup too
it's not that it's an awful scent or anything
this isn't a bad product at all
my skin tends to break out
i can't stress enough that this balm is great for us "oily" girls too
the balm formulation is great for travel as you don't have to worry about accidental spills
this doesn't make my t-zone oily at all
i don't use this to take off my eye makeup though
it melts away makeup as you rub it on your face.
it's worth it because it doesn't dry out my skin
the only reason it didn't get five stars is because it stings my eyes a little if i rub it too close when i'm taking mascara off
your skin does not feel oily after
need something to give you extra moisture
i wear less makeup.
i can't believe how it instantly makes my fine lines disappear
i can't believe the difference in hydration
sometimes even on top of my makeup
i usually don't wear an actual moisturizer under my make-up
it wasn't heavy at all
this stuff is gold in a bottle!
it comes out more like a watery foam that you kind of pat around your face
i do still need a moisturizer over it
don't always cleanse my skin at night so the effects are taking a toll
its a gotta have if you are keeping away from peels etc
stuff is too expensilve to have to throw any away
without being any sort of heavy or greasy feel
which you usually get with something so quenching
totally different type of application than any other product- something refreshing about the cold crisp delivery onto your face
the moisture feeling doesn't go away
can't say that many serums are fun to use like this one
though i dont have a lot of wrinkles
my foundation application seem so simple
it firms up the skin so its not so baggy.
i would bathe in it if i could!
because i can't swing the $150
all the other frown lines around my face that i usually have botoxed aren't visible anymore
my brow wrinkles are soooo much better
not to be mistaken for a full on moisturizer
my fine lines aren't nonexistent yet
my t-zone has not been oily at all.
you'll recognize the smell of this stuff immediately
it's great to have in your beauty arsenal when you need a little more moisture
i don't think it smells bad
doesn't make the skin greasy
it's not the least bit tacky or sticky like some heavy moisturizers are
i hate that it's so expensive
i don't think it smells worse than the cold plasma
i couldn't afford to get a moisturizer
i don't love the smell though
i knocked off a star because it can feel a tad greasy for my combo skin
smooth yet not greasy
my skin was losing it's firmness
it's certainly not unbearable or disgusting by any means
i also like that the creme doesn't make my skin fee heavy on the days i wear makeup
i wouldn't recommend wearing this underneath makeup
i usually just wear it to bed
i really want a "glow" which no daytime moisturizers seem to give me
i usually spend 3 times as much on "rich moisturizers"
not greasy at all
i can have combination skin at times where it gets oily throughout the day
it's usually because i hadn't exfoliated
i can't get over the overpowering smell
doesn't leave stick residue
i will never stray from this combo it's seriously a skin saver
didn't make me break out in oily areas
do they not know that a scented lotion is worse for your skin from having perfumes added?
the fact it's not greasy at all
it's a cream to try if you hate the feeling of having your pores clogged after applying a thick
i don't believe this crème could lighten my scars on it's own
i didn't like to use this under makeup as a morning moisturizer because my face would look greasy after an hour
i don't think the smell is bad
soft when using most of the oh truth line products
the product doesn't lie when it say it promotes cell turnover because it felt like i was getting a new silky face each day using it
it's still my go-to moisturizer
it's not too heavy or too light
this is the only moisturizer i can use that's effective without breaking me out
i cannot get over the smell
i don't want people smelling that on me!
doesn't feel oily or heavy!
i don't find it unpleasant
it also doesn't make me too shiny
the smell long enough to find out
as for the smell some people talk about i find it just smells of oranges
it's greatingredients and lasts a long time.
for this moisturizer it's a little smelly
t's not bad or unpleasant
the scent doesn't bother me one bit
it does not feel heavy
:) it's not oily and absorbs rather quickly.
it's the only one i'll use!
i would prefer this to be packaged in a tube or pump bottle because it's a lot more liquid than solid
i rated this 5 stars even though i'm not good with the jar
the only thing i've found that does the trick formy acne-prone
my regular moisturizer can't take this heat
my skin is prone to being a bit oily so finding an effective product that does not make my skin feel even oilier is a challenge
after i tried a sample which lasted 4days i had to get this stuff it givs my skin a naturally glow
this almost rolls over your skin like it's on a roller
it's not it's just your finger
the only way you wouldn't like the smell of this is if you don't like the way oranges smell
over cause it's that good
i wouldn't say it absorbs "quickly"
i imagine some might find it a little greasy as once it soaks in
i tend to get a very oily t-zone
especially when living in a crazy city that doesn't sleep
the tiny bottle will last forever unless you apply very liberally
it's hard to sleep sometimes
you'll notice a cooling sensation where you apply
just make sure not to rub your eyes.
although this does not make the headache magically disappear
it does make it numb enough that i can actually function
i put this on my temples sometimes
it's not too intense
doesn't feel heavy on the skin
if i am wearing makeup
if you at least get occasional breakouts
i knew that my skin seemed a lot less oily when i used it
i can get a little oily in the t zone
the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is that if it is hot enough to make me sweat it can clog pores
i don't have to worry about breakouts like i do with most makeup primers
it does not clog your pores or cause you to break out at all
sometimes i don't even put moisturizer over it because it's hydrating enough to be worn alone
i did notice that my skin is less shiny in the afternoon
maybe is because my complexion has never been oily
my skin doesn't ever feel oily or filmy
i don't longer wake up with an oily face
it really suits acne-prone easy flare up skin such as mine
think it's worth the money for a good moisturizer that leaves your skin feeling smooth
i usually don't go overboard for products in any category
i tend to hate adding anything to my skin care routine for fear that it will cause irritation or breakouts
i find that as it gets rid of unnecessary shine
the scent does not linger
today my skin didn't look shiny even well into the afternoon
so far it's helped with my oily skin
it doesn't make me greasy
can't tell any difference in my pore size or any toning on my skin
at least it does what i need which is to keep my oily skin under control
though it left my skin feeling a bit tacky
i like it more than koh gen do's oriental plants cream because the pump for this product is much more sanitary than having to dip your fingers into the cream everyday
s that get super sticky rather than the face
it doesn't feel that sticky at all on your face
sinks in easily and not greasy at all.
except theres no spf but its all natural.
theres no harsh chemicals or anything.
it goes on your skin
you can tell it seals all the moisture in
doesn't come off on the pillow case
otherwise it won't turn to foam itself in your h
if you're the kind of person who likes a squeaky-clean feeling post-wash
i want that squeaky clean feel unlike most washes that feel slimy
i feel like i have to keep rinsing like there's still product on my face
it's hard to find products that are all natural
you literally get a squeaky clean feel.
it is unlike anything i have ever used- the actual product comes out like a thick lotion or paste
when i touch my face after i use it there is no residue or oil
the only think i can liken it to is when you wash your hair
so you have oily or combination skin type
i know it's a bit pricey
is there anything worse than a tacky or sticky moisturizer that doesn't dry down?
this product never gives me the greasy shiny face
this product doesn't pull at your under eyes
cold spoons do the same trick for less
dont apply many layers of it though 2 sweeps under each eye is what i do
feels cooling when it's put on.
i also think it's helping with the wrinkles!
idk how they did it bc usually anything minty burns my eyes
assume the de-puffing may not work for all
sephora employee said if i apply on top of makeup to only dab- not smear
at least i don't look tired
can live with out is that it can feel a bit heavy over your bags
the only thing is i wish it came in a cream gel instead of a stick balm
if you just rub some on your finger tips it takes too long to get enough product to cover my eyes
this product is perfect for getting rid of those puffy eyes whenever you haven't had enough sleep
when i use this my concealer doesn't crease nearly as much
not a big fan of the minty/cooling feeling though it's too strong for me
it's especially magical if you keep it in the fridge--super cool 1st thing in the am
nothing worked until i tried boscia's super cool de-puffing eye balm
it helps de-puff my eyes a lot
if i get pretty bad allergy attacks though
i feel like my eye area actually gets de-puffed.
it's just the cooling sensation
i find this more refreshing then seriously de-puffing
it's also so light
it's a pick me up!
i don't rub them
totally gets rid of the allergic reaction
i prefer it to a specific eye cream because i tend to rush beauty routine
not irritating or heavy.
it is gentle enough to use right from the tube.
also likes boscia super cool de-puffing eye balm for getting rid of his dark circles
i tend to use it every morning
as a person who often pulls all nighters
it's now something i carry with me as a part of my regular routine along with ole hendriksen eye cc cream
i personally don't have puffiness under my eyes
you will require sleep sometimes!
does not sting or burn eyes
f it's not very hydrating as some reviewers have claimed
i dont think it really de-puffs or lightens under eye circles
this has a little sheen that some might not like
clarins always makes my acne go away somehow
you'll easily get 6 months use out of this
skin care lines bc her skin feels it right away if the cream is watered down or really rich
it's a good night cream, but not for my skin.
i don't need to use a lot to cover my face
doesn't grease up the face
it's pricey for a jar
it does not promise to remove your wrinkles or make you look 20 years younger
i don't even use a primer.
neck creams because i'd been struggling for years to find a moisteriser that doesn't break me out
i ended up having to use it as night cream because it is just too rich for combination skin types
it gives me the right amount of moisture without feeling greasy
get lots of compliments on my skin
the only thing is it doesn't provide enough hydration for dry skin
i do not wear foundation or powder unless it's a special occasion
my skin became snooty all of a sudden
not greasy at all
my pores seem to not be as clogged
"fillers" which may make the skin appear nicer
whenever i want to 'detox' from the chemicals
i can't use heavy moisturizers they break out my skin
i shudder to think how dry the other reviewer's skin must be if she's forced to use a heavy night cream to get any moisture during the day
those were really just the basics--the foaming cleanser
i got some breakouts
think your skin does get used to it
just fyi, silica is most definitely not silicone.
i love that this line doesn't use any silicones
at night i just wear it on it's own after cleansing
i think $145 for only 15ml is a little extravagant
this eye cream doesn't have any anti-aging results
you can smell the cucumber which makes you feel like you are at the spa
fine lines seem to disappear
the o reviving eye cream certainly doesn't disappoint
i love that i can still feel a veil of moisture if i tap my eye area at the end of full day
apply an extra tab on any pimple or scar you may have
does help clear out your skin
it's not tight or uncomfortable
you should have seen my cotton pads
they are good it's easier to extract blackheads after
but your face doesn't feel stripped.
don't want the prune look in exchange for clean skin
i like this kind of cleaning mask
this mask does not get rid of stubborn blackheads
doesn't tolerate many products
not greasy or heavy
usually when a cream smells
you get all the decadence
like me- this is a must add to your routine
it does not leave my skin feeling too oily
won't strip it of it's natural oils
i wouldn't use this as a make up remover though.
i love that i only need to use a tiny bit to get enough foamy goodness to wash my whole face
i generally don't like putting fragrance oils on my face
couldn't be happier with this cleanser
not a bad foam at all.
it completely took it all off- i didn't even have to get a cotton pad after for some residue cleaning
it doesn't do anything other than cleanse the skin
it doesn't foam up the same way other foaming cleansers do
this wash is pricy
i honestly use the smallest bit to lather my entire face
it doesn't break me out or make me feel greasy.
it's oil-free thus not greasy
doesn't cause acne don't switch
anything with spf is going to make your skin feel greasy
my skin does not feel heavy or sticky
so this tells you it's good for a variety of skin tones
this is not irritating
only complaint is that is smells a little too much like suntan lotion
this isn't the product
surely helps make my acne scars disappear
it is not greasy at all
helps even out skin
whats to even out skin tone
the skin ton correcting lotion isn't as good as they were
the bonus is the spf too!
i guess it's because most cosmetic companies assume that oily skin does not need hydration
it's too soon to tell about the "skin tone correcting" properties
it's great for oily skin
no smell which is a bonus since i have horrid allergies in summer
doesn't pill when i'm applying primer on top
this does not make my face look shiney
if i use a gel type moisturizer its not enough
does not break me out or feel oily on my skin
muf powder it's all good
acne marks have gone away completely although i don't think it would work if you have deep scars from acne
you can't put on makeup or primer right after you use this though
juno is just so soothing!
it doesn't cause any breakouts either.
i am not crazy about the smell but it fades away.
skip juno if you have normal or oily skin
my hormonal breakouts are literally little to none
my skin looks even
if you think you don't need a facial oil because it is an "oil" you are so wrong
always being clogged with product after product of ingredients that i simply settled for since i wasn't big on skin care in my 20's
that black cumin in this oil really did wonders in making my skin look decongested
best of all it does not clog my pores
not heavy i use 5 drops every night
it literally is everything your skin needs
i would much rather have that smell than a fake synthetic fragrance on my face
it does look shiny when you first apply it
also a little too oily under my foundation for day use unless i want a dewy finish
in the morning i don't even need to wash my face
the luna treatment oil does more for my skin
if your skin is grumpy like mine try using just one drop in your moisturizer at night every 2 days
i hate the smell, but you'll get used to it.
i love this oil and so does my skin.
so many oils just sit on top looking shiny
it doesn't oxidize or separate my makeup either
it's real pricey for me.
i also use this oil on my face in the mornings on these days that i don't have to wear makeup because i have combo skin
it's a little oily for my face
the juno doesn't seem to soak in quite as quickly
have noticed that it's helping with my somewhat crepey skin around my temples
chin don't overproduce oil anymore
i did experience mild purging on my face
primers just make it sit on my skin
makeup actually lasts even without priming
i am not sure how this would work for those with oily skin
it does not make my skin look oily
not to mention topical rxs that are somehow supposed to all save my skin
this oil doesn't irritate or cause any breakouts.
no joke after a couple drops of this stuff you look like someone who actually drinks 8 glasses of water a day
even though you'll want to be slathered in it 24/7
if you've ever smelled oregano oil it smells a lot like that
no small pimples or anything have come up
it doesn't do well at all with products that have silicone/dimethicone
this oil is great it doesn't irritate my face
as someone who suffers from fragrance induced migraines it doesn't irritate me at all
the smell doesn't linger
i do wear it under primer as well
it's such a different feeling
can't imagine putting on my moisturizers without the product
i don't get that greasy look by 2pm that makes me feel like i need to redo make-up or reach for blotting papers
the smell however makes me cringe when i put it on
i suppose that depends on the condition of your skin
with an oily t-zone that tends to react to almost everything
get rid of the fancy packaging
that it couldnt be covered with makeup
im not sure if its the addition of the luna oil thats helping the hyperpigmentation most
does not leave an oily feeling
getting rid of your acne
i just use my exfoliators to get that off
i still get the occasional breakout
this product does make my face more oily throughout the day
i simply blot my face with something oil absorbing a couple times
i don't wear makeup nearly as often anymore.
i know it's a bit on the pricey side
the tingle tells you it's working, no?
i don't see a problem with my combo skin
can't imagine not using this in my nightly routine
add it into your routine slowly or you'll probably "purge"
i recommend to anybody with damaged skin or dull skin because it will repair your skin as well as make you have a glow from within
i usually get breakouts around my mouth
this product made my "no makeup days" a reality.
don't have wrinkles yet
some texture i don't like
the odor doesn't bother me
there's no tiptoe-ing around the fact that this stuff is a little stinky
it doesn't feel heavy or oily
the icky scent fades rather quickly
if the smell wasn't a little off
and yes it stinks like sour milk.
so far it's kept my hormonal acne in check
like the sort of peel that your dermatologist does that you skin falls off after
so you may want to cut with moisturizer
am hoping it won't cause irritation
helps even out my complexion
i get tons of compliments on my makeup
just glowly never oily especially when i wear makeup it's a bomb "primer"
a life time of unpredictable acne has left me very skeptical when it comes to magical "cure-alls"
while i don't have many wrinkles
makeup slides no matter what i use
i noticed that i'm not using as much concealer to hide it
it just smells of citrus which wasn't bad to me at all
if you don't use acids, you need to.
glowy look on your face
i don't get really itchy unless i have a fresh dark spot
it's like only my problem areas itch/burn so that tells me it is working
can't put my finger on it
as long as you moisturize that isn't a problem
it's recommended for use in conjunction with the luna oil which is amazing even if you aren't quite in the demographic worried about anti-aging yet because of its awesome ingredients
you wash your face
you have to moisturize and it'll do the rest!
some say it's eczema
for someone like me who was spending an insane amount of money on a prescription cream that left my face greasy it's a trade off that works in my favor
i find it difficult to find products that either don't over-moisturize my already oily skin
a must try for dull looking skin.
this stuff smells so fresh
you'll only end up hating how good it is
it doesn't dry you out or make you peel!
you're skin needs to get use to it.
i usually don't review products
nothing i tried was either gentle or strong enough to tackle my face
it clogs my pores so much i would break it like when i had acne when i was 13
the smell isn't that bad
i hate that it's so expensive
it doesn't irritate my skin
i feel like it's worth the splurge because all you need is a pea-size amount for your whole face
my skin eats this stuff up
it's almost gel-like.
it removes every bit of makeup that my micellar water doesn't get
i would recommend pairing this with a clarisonic to really get that deep cleanse
because it is a gentle effective cleanser that doesn't damage my skin
it doesn't have the bad stuff, like sulfates.
it doesn't irritate in the slightest
bottom line this is the best cleanser on the market for us combo skin 40 somethings who still experience the occasional break out
it doesn't leave your face feeling dry after you wash
usually smells don't bother me that much
i love how it is just the right amount of foaming because anything excessive leaves my skin lifeless
this stuff shrinks my pores like no other
you can feel it's doing a good job of removing excess dirt/oil/ makeup
i would be embarrassed to wear a highlighter because it would look so bumpy
giving the purity a break so that my skin doesn't get too used to either one
it's kind of a sleeper hit
don't expect a ton of suds
just all around blah looking skin
a negative is when you get it in your eyes it burn
i tend to get a few breakouts here
i think this is a bit pricey for something that's just going to be rinsed down the drain
it even kept my hormonal break outs from being as bad
i guess from all of the clay ingredients
it's a rest cleanser the different clays really feel like it's lifting everything out of your pores
the smell is not bad at all
only giving 4 stars cause of the smell
it won't really remove makeup much
i did have to take one star off because you do need to use a good makeup remover before using it
doesn't irritate it but makes my skin feel clean.
the word clay made me think it would be a thicker substance
just unlike anything i've smelled before
it is not a cleanser i can use everyday
it doesn't dig deep to clean out dirt
i can't use this cleanser every day
my face can easily get irritated from beauty products
it smells just like simple green household cleaner which throws me off a bit
this doesn't work very well if you're going to apply it to dry skin when cleansing
it's your average cleanser
nothing has ever gotten rid of those blackheads.
it's a statement and it's staying
it has cleared up my really annoying acne
i like it because i didn't have to keep spraying my face with setting spray as i have a oily t zone
i still get blemishes occasionally.
doesn't feel dried out at all
this is finally one of the only cleansers i've found that truly dries out my skin a bit
f you feel like you're not getting the best results with the cleanser without the aid of a brush
you'll never wash without one again once you've used it
i usually think any product that claims to reduce pore size is just a gimmick
i often get congestion in my t-zone area as far as blackheads go
if you are sensitive to scent you will not enjoy this as it does smell a little funky
clogged pores are super obvious on me even if they aren't blackheads
this could just be my skin purging.
it it does a good job of removing the yuck
i find i don't get as oily as i used to during the day
it's gentle enough that it doesn't irritate my eyes
my skin type is 30
this doesn't strip the skin of it's natural oils.
it's a little stinky but tolerable.
once you rub it on your h
the only place that i ever get blemishes is in the area between my eyebrows which is always very oily
it's odd because the rest of my skin is normal.
the scent doesn't linger
i can't even explain the clean feeling you get after using
i still get the occasional pimple from my period
this cleanser does everything it says it does
it doesn't foam up
then i noticed my blackheads were so bad you could see them through all of my products
they do seem to change the formula often
with combination skin i was afraid this would make my face look shiny
my skin has the tendency to go oily if the wrong product is applied
i do believe its softened my "laugh lines
it also burns if my skin is irritated or if i use my acne mask too much or exfoliate too much
my skin does not tolerate anything too oily or it breaks out
it's very rich so you only need a dab
it can make your skin feels greasy
find that it's completely absorbed after a few minutes- no tackiness
it's not greasy or pore-clogging
so that the cream actually penetrates in the way i would want my skin to be lifted
unless you like to burn your face w/retinol
didn't really help with dark spots or firming
doesnt leave a residue or greasy feel at all
while this doesn't prevent pimples
i do notice a smoother texture which is probably due to its anti-ox ingredients
the one thing i do not like about this is that it has more of an oily texture
this does not clog pores or cause breakouts at all
argan oil makes me break out but this one does´t.
pat it on your skin.
even though it's billed as an anti-aging product
i swear this stuff keeps me from getting too oily in the summer
i don't have a lot of wrinkles
i don't have wrinkles or laugh lines
like i said: not one single pimple
so there's no burning
it's an oil, but it hasn't created any breakouts.
doesn't leave any film or residue
haven't touched the stuff since because my skin can't h
it looks like my face has been photoshopped or something -- seriously
it's not greasy, it sinks right in.
oh and i'm putting it on my neck too.
if you like to follow with extra layer i think any gel formula moisturizer works great with it
doesn't clog my pores
moisturizers alone don't really work well
or are so thick i can't st
i don't have a lot of wrinkles
my skin doesn't get dark spots as easily as it was before i started using this
it's not sticky like some other face serums.
most importantly it doesn't burn or dry out my face like some retinol products do
i can't believe how smooth my skin is.
don't expect it to erase them completely.
although it doesn't work well on wrinkles around the mouth/lips it is fabulous around the eyes
do not use on pores
this product works really well on my lip lines
doesn't leave any residue behind
this stuff isn't greasy or heavy feeling.
my makeup doesn't settle
it will look messy
i found it's best to dab it on rather then rub.
it also doesn't flake or come off as that gummy residue like some products do when you apply make-up over it
the lip area you can't see the lines at all now.
line fillers do a decent job of disguising them
they're still there when i take my makeup off
this is real expensive for what's essentially a silicone filler/primer
i don't have deep-set wrinkles yet
it actually turns your face into a 'flawless canvass' for which your foundation
concealer sit perfectly upon without any of the usual issues of caking or settling into your fine lines
5 eye creams that i rotate on a daily basis so you can say that i've seen a bit of what's out there
it doesn't turn white when applied
doesn't notice "cakey" stuff under my eyes
make sure it's smoothed in over my wrinkles
it's less than other products that claim to remove your wrinkles
it keeps my pimples away completely especially if you use the face wash that goes with it
it doesn't make your skin dry or tight which i really appreciate
my face doesn't get oily during the day
the only downside is it smells so strange
it doesn't irritate skin as long as you use the recommended amount
i give it 4 stars only because it's rather pricey for the size of the tube you get
the slightest bit of anything medicated usually leaves me red
the fact that it's also a lotion really seems to help my issues with dryness
does not feel heavy
don't expect all your redness
i think that's a bit excessive
it's not greasy, applies evenly, and works great!
i literally can't use nothing my skin is so sensitive
no bums, no awful breakouts.
not too weak and not too oily.. just right !
which i prefer for my skin
it's helped with her breakouts as well
i find that it works really well at treating breakouts without making my skin freak out--no dryness
i don't think it's a good acne spot treatmeant though
this stuff doesn't work overnight.
doesn't dry your skin out or leave any residue on your skin
it definitely helped with the occasional little bumps i get without irritating or drying out my skin
the product doesn't have much of a scent
only concern is that this is not a moisturiser nor is its gel hydrating enough to replace your regular moisturiser unless you have really really oily skin
i can use a hard face wash
i don't have pimples everywhere
doesn't make my not-so-oily nose red
the opening of the tube is very wide—you don't even need to squeeze—product just slides out
it's just not nourishing enough on its own
especially when it's $40 a bottle
or at least a smaller hole on the lid so that you didn't accidentally squeeze too much
i no longer have red irritated zits which is awesome
in the day it's just fine
i found that putting this lotion in the fridge thickens it up enough that it doesn't glob out when you pop the cap
the dispensing hole is way too big
in the summer it's enough moisture for me
still have some oily spots around my t-zone
i wouldn't recommend it for someone with acne.
it all has sooo much irritating alcohol
t doesn't become too drying
works great not greasy yet not drying
makes your face look a bit shiny after you apply it
this stuff is amazing especially for oily skin or a dull complextion lights up face
i did feel like it was wasteful
someone who hasn't used this type of product before may experience more flaking
i love that it's mild on the skin yet effective.
my skin doesn't feel oily
but i don't like the smell of this.
this is the only moisturizer ive found that helps clear up my stubborn blemishes without making me overly dry or more oily
i think this gets rid of acne
i get the occasional pimple here
totally worth it if you need a quick zit zapper treatment
they do have whiteheads
clear days does not irritate my skin or cause my face to swell
i now use it occasionally when i get a pimple
my skin doesn't feel dried out or irritated in the slightest
it doesn't dry your skin or leave it feeling strange
every so often i get a pimple or two around my mouth
it's better than 7 days of using tons of concealer to hide them
i think you'll see much better results if you use it on clean skin at night
doesn't over dry my skin and it can't be seen.
i usually don't use spot treatments because i felt like it was a waste since i have adult acne here
you can see a difference in acne size over night
i could not get rid of many pimples
there's no way to get it out once it stops dispensing
no need to cover them or pick at your face bc this keeps everything tiny
it does sting a bit depending on how much or where on ur face
it's a strong acne spot treatment, and i love it!
i do still get breakouts
i only occasionally break out
it does leave a bit of an odd
t doesn't make acne go away
it's not the best as a spot treatment though because the pump design
doesn't conflict with makeup
still "thick" at the same time where it doesn't absorb
it's changed my skin texture
love it under my makeup
the smell is not overpowering as some other creams i have tried
doesn't leave a greasy feel on your face.
it lets me apply all the make up i want without worrying about dry patches
can't seem to find a cream i really like
soaks in quickly so that it doesn't leave a greasy layer on top of your skin
not even half price of my biotherm gel
it melts right into your skin
not greasy at all
useally i dont like anything too oily
this didn't make me brake out yes did get oily
if you buy a oil matterfier you don't have to worry much about your oily skin
i don't usually like buying products i have to stick my fingers in
i love this moisturizer because it doesn't feel greasy
it's not greasy and feels very soothing.
this cream gives my skin so much moisture without any greasy feeling or any sort of heavy cream feeling
it's not greasy feeling
it's not greasy at all
i occasionally get rough bumby skin or un even skin on my face
i wouldn't wear this under makeup because it is pretty heavy
doesn't make your face feel greasy afterwards
doesn't feel greasy or too dewy
i love that the cream doesn't just sit on my face
t doesn't get greasy or oily
not only is the smell fresh
doesn't leave me with a greasy residue
tried a sample n i couldnt believe how it didnt make my skin dry nor did i have patchy skin when i put my make up on
it's gotten worse bc it's getting colder
i know if you have dry skin your makeup looks terrible if you don't have a good product to hydrate you face
i love feeling like i'm giving my combo skin enough moisture without oversaturating it with a heavy feeling
perfect for daytime because its fast absorbing so there's no residue
my only gripes- the fragrance is a bit heavy
i don't want to go without this moisturizer for one day
t doesn't feel like an oily product justs sits on top
not too oily for my combination skin
for years i've been using the neutrogena oil-free moisturizer even though it's super liquidy
it doesn't irritate my dry sensitive skin on either my face or neck
i usually have ezcema on my neck
this product is not greasy on me
it does not feel heavy on your face
you only need one dab to get coverage for your entire face
it doesn't leave my face feeling greasy
this works perfectly as long as i don't put it on my nose
it doesn't leave a greasy feel
it doesn't have any fancy anti-aging properties
this cream does the trick
glossy that it can't be layered under make-up
i hate moisturisers that make you look like an oil rig after applying especially applying it before stepping out of the house
i came to realise it does make my skin a little bit oily
this moisturizer has almost completely solved that problem for me without being too greasy or oily or causing any other problems
it's not over bearing
that's what i have eye cream for.
i don't use eye masks much
i dont really have puffy under eye bags
i can't stress enough how hard it is for me to find something that works for my genetic eye bags
i've stocked up while they're at this price i recommend you do too
you can lighten them
not get rid of them
not only was the gel so tidy
it doesn't leave any messy liquid around
if you're looking to try an eye mask
it's like a sleeping eye cover
i know some other reviewers didn't like the stickiness or weight of it on their eyes
it wasn't sticky when i took it off
so easy as there is no product to apply or finicky pads to stick on
if you've had no sleep
haven't eaten right there is not a lot that can completely obliterate the puff
i've never had such a thick
it didn't completely de-puff my eyes
although the package recommends 20-i got so bored
even with my meds
also a plus to know that it doesn't contain bad ingredients
i don't know if it's meant to be reusable
it doesn't really work for acne marks
buy it if you want to get rid of acne
doesnt irritate them more or make them red
sometimes sleep just isn't at the top of my list of things to do
it isn't the slightest bit messy
it is honestly the only product i have found that actually reduces puffiness underneath my eyes
doesn't smell that strong or bad.
this actually works and it's inexpensive.
it didn't eliminate signs of fatigue nor did i find it invigorating
i do dialysis 3x a week so often get a little puffed around my eyes in between treatments
i work full time so can't look puffy on the job!
if you're generally sleep deprived
or when my allergies are horrible
or when i have a horrible headache
they always leave my eyes less puffy
loved the fact you don't have to wash it off
so sticky, yet not.
it's such a cool delivery system.
it makes your eyes look less tired
i can't speak too much to the anti-aging benefits
8 of these masks i think
it doesn't leak or make you wet
don't feel as cool on your face for as long
i usually keep it in the fridge for extra refreshing feeling
said it might help with my often puffy
not irritating at all
regardless of how much eye cream i put on or water i drink
i still eat clean which i know helps
you will see less acne
this stuff is like liquid gold.
it's way less inflamed
it's not a product that makes your blemishes disappear overnight
black heads then you'll love this
this product alone makes my skin so smooth
every other night so my skin can chill
now i can't live without this gel
this product not only clears your pores out
i also like how the cap never cracks/breaks like other plastic caps do
the only reason why i took away the star is because sometimes it smells slightly chemically
literally makes my pimples dissapear in one night
you can cover your whole face with this gel twice a day without irritating it
i rarely get pimples anymore
doesn't feel like i have a layer of anything on my face
i prefer having this rash to acne because when the rash clears up there won't be acne underneath
can't deal with acne
i get the worst under-the-skin pimples that never seem to go away
you need one pump to cover your whole face
unless you mix up your own skin concoctions
i cannot live without this amazing little bottle of skin perfection
those ingredients irritated my skin if i wasn't careful
i rarely suffer from breakouts anymore.
i also like that it doesn't bother my mild case of keratosis polaris
it's not too drying.
don't really need a moisturizer
my skin just couldn't seem to clear up
it doesn't dry it out and it really works.
i don't think it's too pricey for how long it lasts
it's fading my acne marks while keeping any breakouts in check
it's great even as a spot treatment
you can even wear it under your make up with no change in the way your make up looks or feels
it does go on sticky, but dries instantly.
a must have in your skin care routine if you have acne
it really does seem to help keep my once moderate acne to a maybe 1-2 times a week small pimple instead of the cystic ones that i used to get
it never really did much to my blackheads as they're still visible
it'll go away the more your skin becomes used to it
i don't have terrible acne
i don't think it leaves a white film on my face
it doesn't feel like there's anything on my skin when i wear it
i still get zits
they're not too bad
the only downside is that it doesn't clear up my blemishes
this actually works on the the acne
it's a strong exfoliant bringing all these blemishes that you would ordinarily have anyways to head quickly to treat them
i do not seem to have to worry about it drying my skin with use
does not sting or feel too medicine like.
i do still get some flair ups
i can't even remember the last time that my skin was blemish less
it doesn't stop the acne
this gel is not greasy
to not have to hide my skin under all that foundation
deeply clogged pores that facials wouldn't even completely clear up are starting to clear
there are still some very stubborn buggers that won't go away
this is not irritating to my skin
i don't always get body acne
does not feel greasy
blackheads do not seem so black anymore
not greasy at all
this gel seems to help fade old post-acne marks that tend to be stubborn
this moisturizer seems heavy when you put it on
doesn't have any pore-clogging ingredients.
this does not clog my pores at all
everyone's skin is different
does not clog the pores.
didn't get shiny in a few hours
does not clog pores
it's a perfect moisturizer because my skin isn't super oily mid-day
doesn't leave my cheeks
i hope it isn't too greasy for me in the summertime
the problem was actually my cleanser
i don't find the smell to be bad
sometimes just using one with sunscreen doesn't give me that nice moisturized feeling
oil free moisturizer that won't wreak havoc on my skin
it doesn't cause breakouts where her skin is oily
it's really oil-free
this moisturizer is like nothing else.
it doesn't leave any residue or shine.
unfortunately it's difficult to get the product out of the container
love to wear this under makeup!!
nor does it feel silicon-y
the moisturizer does not leave a greasy finish
is like a quick drink to my skin
i would recommend this to anyone with acne or problem skin
it doesn't clog my pores
not greasy at all
some don't have enough moisture.
funny enough some actually dried out my skin
it doesn't clog my pours
i love this moisturizer -- it's the only one that doesn't make my sensitive skin break out
i give it 4 stars just because it's so expensive!
i love the pump because i feel that the product stays sanitary as it is not in a jar
does not feel greasy when i touch my face.
does not clog pores or casue break outs which is important with my amture
i simply use the wash
doesn't make my face feel like an oil slick
it is so lightweight that i was worried it wouldn't even provide any moisturize
i love this one it does not make your face oily
just like the description says it's not at all sticky or oily feeling
i know it's a little pricey
does not leave greasy residue.
it also doesn't make me shinny
breaks out occasionally so he's been trying to find something as well
does not break out my acne-prone skin
i can justify buying this moisturizer because at the end of the day my face doesn't end up looking like an oil-slick
love it because i tend to get oily skin
goes on so lightly that you can't even tell it's there:
this oil free moisturizer doesn't make my face feel oily or greasy like most moisturizers do
doesn't feel heavy on my skin
i would definitely recommend this product for someone with normal to oily skin
other oil free moisturizers i've used after about 30 minutes it's like i haven't even put one on
its oil free formula doesn't stress skin out
i know there's a better moisturizer out there
i should say that's one of the best moisturizers i've tried especially when you have oily skin
i tend to have some crazy combination skin
i like to wear a non-greasy moisturizer with no spf on my face when i go to the gym so the spf doesn't run into my eyes when i sweat
does not make my face feel oily which i love
it's great, non-sticky, non-greasy.
leaves no greasy feeling at all
this is perfect for putting on before my makeup because it doesn't make me look oily
does not aggrivate my acne-prone skin
even though its oil free i don't feel like my face is dry at all
if you are prone to break outs.
trust me you'll be pleasantly surprised
didn't clog my pores
the only thing is that some people might not like the density of the cream since it's thicker than most moisturizers
it's especially good after cleansing or after you take off a mask
my makeup did not sit well on top of this moisturizer
if you don't wear foundation often
i don't wear make up to work
it doesn't do a huge amount for pores
the only downside is parts of my face are drier than others so those parts can get cakey if i use only this
it gives enough hydration to the skin so you dont feel tight or dried up
this hydrator is everything you need to wear under your primer or/
it's a little pricy for a moisturizer
i'd say my t-zone is half as oily
it is like sealing your face in perfection if you have perfect skin
this moisturizer is one of the only products i can use everyday that doesn't break me out
goes on so smooth and holds your makeup.
my face doesn't look oily at all
if it didnt irritate my eyes
i can't leave the house without wearing this hydrator
works on pores while it's at it- an absolute must
it doesn't completely fix my large pores
i don't get the oily shine until way at the end of my day
this stuff closes my pores
no break outs on this fair skin/sensitive gal.
truly does make your pores look smaller
i never used to wear moisturizer during the day because it always used to make my skin oily
the reason i think it's better than murad's mattifying moisturizer is that while murad's has this weird gluey consistency
i can wash my face
i know that if you don't use a moisturizer
so normally i just use a ton of blotting paper
i don't notice a difference in the size of my pores yet
i couldn't find one that would control the shine
not shiny at all the entire day
you may think it's expensive
don't have skin that is wrinkle-prone
i been using this product for 12 days i love it i have a little tip if you can go to sauna or stem room
you will see change on your skin dramatitcly
i don't skimp when using skin products
i love how it soaks into my skin rather than sit on top like traditional mask i feel like it works better because it soaks in yes it's pricy
it's a bit pricey at $75 a bottle
actually seems to clog my pores
otherwise goes back to its dull self
i don't mind the smell.
it's meant to be put underneath a moisturizer
doesn't leave any weird residual texture on your skin
the one down thing i don't like is the lid of the product doesn't stay on well
it's not running into any issues with my routine
doesn't matter if you have oily
i tried every rich moisturizer i could think of
it didn't irritate my skin or break me out
it's almost like my skin goes "ahh" when i put it on
it does not make my t-zone oily
i personally don't like the serum that stays on the face forever
this doesn't sting at all
you can feel it soak into your skin leaving it smooth
there isn't anymore texture on my skin
it has a really wet texture so your skin just drinks it up
it's thin enough to wear under makeup without altering it
i didn't think i'd get much use due to my oiliness
this is the one cream i've been able to use that doesn't leave my skin oily or cause any sort of reaction
not tacky or greasy in any way
going easy on the topical acne stuff
not stick or greasy
doesn't feel heavy or oily
does wonders for my combination skin
i really dislike heavy serums that feel thick like primers
t absorbs right into your skin
one star off because it's a bit sticky when i put it on
i can actually feel the lotion popping into my pores when i tap it in
think this serum is fine enough to fill my pores rather than just sit on top
it's light enough to wear under my moisturizer
i really can't recommend this serum enough.
where your skin doesn't feel dry
you don't really have a heavy glow either?
knowing that there's natural ingredients
doesn't make me oily it's the best
i say splurge because even though it's not the most expensive product on my dresser
you'd think the benefit of having super oily skin is that you never have to worry about dryness
i call it a little miracle worker because it hydrates
redness is barely there anymore
this stuff is liquid gold.
doesn't make me look greasy throughout the day
seriously, if you have oily skin, you need this!
it hydrates like nothing else!
won't leave you feeling greasy
i am acne prone and this doesn't break me out.
it's very hard to find something that will help hydrate my skin without causing a breakout
it surely moisturizes your skin without making your skin too oily
i like that this doesn't make my t zone oily while it makes sure that my u zone stays out from dryness
she was afraid that any serums would make her acne worse again
so some flakiness is inevitable
somehow it's also calming
applying moisturizer makes your face feel like it is on fire?
oil not so oily feel
i usually use this after my shower
i like to mix it in with some vaseline when i apply it
i generally use this without perfume because i'm scared the scents will change
so it's a good cover up for body odor!
which isn't obvious on this site so application isn't messy
the bottle is glass though so be careful if you leave this is the bathroom
it doesn't feel greasy
it's super convenient to use when you're being lazy
there's nothing like it
i can probably transfer the product into one of those pump containers or maybe a spray bottle ?
like the most expensive baby powder you'll ever smell
i don't like the spray pump- i wish i could pour the desired amount of oil i want to use instead of having to spritz
'm not sure if it makes combination skin more oily
when i use it i just skip perfume!
before then i was always skeptical of oil thinking that would stain my clothing or make me look greasy
couldn't use it everyday
it's never greasy or slick
it doesn't stick around all day
it's not as greasy as coconut oil
sometimes my face when i skip makeup
smell i'm not a big fan of this smell
it's easy to carry in your makeup bag
doesn't leave a greasy feel like some heavier oils
preaches it's benefits to everyone under the sun
is like a vacation for your senses
it doesn't clog my pores or cause breakouts
not greasy at all
doesn't weigh it down at all
doesn't irritate my easily irritated skin
it doesn't clog my pores
i don't typically like to put oil on my body
i don't mind the scent at all
i didn't even need to use a beauty blender
my skin does not get oily
it doesn't even feel like oil because it's so light
it smells so good and doesn't feel too oily.
couldn't afford the argon oil so get this one instead
it doesn't have that smearing-feeling when you apply it
not too sure about oily skin.
the scent is kind of overpowering if used alone.
want to avoid smelling like the oil all day
it does sit on your skin so when wearing silk type clothes i would not recommend using if you get dressed in an hour of using
this oil feels amazing on the skin--i like it best when i spray it on after the shower
still smell like it
i can't generally h
my skin is happy to soak this stuff up without the tiniest bit of redness
it doesn't sit on the skin
i couldn't get past the scent
it masks the scent enough
i think it's a bit overwhelming to use on the face
it is not sticky at all you can apply it to your body or hair or even on your face witch is really h
it's also the only oil i trust on my hair without making it overly greasy
it's one of those products i have to use every day
the leftover oil on my face doesn't make me look shiny even though it feels great
it doesn't linger too long
it doesn't make my face oily
my t-zone is always oily this makes it a satin feel
and it does not look oily.
it's easy to apply too much
in which case you will find that your skin will look like shiny
it doesn't leave my skin greasy
i don't know if it's the scent or the texture
you only need the littlest bit
which makes up for it's price tag
doesn't leave my face shiny or oily looking
it's amazing as it says for face hair
upon layering it on my body to work it's oily goodness i decided this smells exactly like bvlgari rose essentualle perfume- which i don't mind
even out my skin
it absolute into the skin like water it is not greasy
the smell does take some getting use to
i do apply some to my hair
don't be fooled by smelling the contents in the bottle
i didn't like it used in my hair, felt heavy.
i would also use it as an overnight mask when i feel like i'm too lazy to wash it off
i wonder if it will work well with the red clay cleanser ?
this winter might not ruin my skin after all.
you just have a bad skin day sometimes
it's not overpowering at all.
it doesn't dry on your face like other masks
i like to use this on days where my skin is flaky
sometimes i get a bit of irritation
this mask is the only mask that actually soothes my skin
this doesn't irritate it at all
even the slightest change in weather can really mess me up
i always like the texture of my skin after i wash this mask off
smells like oatmeal basically
it dries a bit weird
i wouldn't say this is the most hydrating thing in the world
simple easy mask to do a few times a week
it doesn't make my oily parts worse
i like this because it's cheap
does not leave oily
even if you have acne or irritated skin that isn't necessarily dry
if you need something soothing
it's more of an instant fix type thing
which i found to be too greasy
is not greasy at all
i know product as moisturizing as this would probably wreak havoc on my t-zone
this mask definitely helps sooth my eczema flare ups when nothing else will work
never makes my skin red or causes break outs
wanted to try a mask that doesn't dry my skin the minute i take it off
did not rip out any stray hairs that got in the way
the reason i gave it 4 stars is i did feel oily after using it
however i will note that this is probably not the best mask for people with oily skin
doesnt irritate it at all
u did rinse it off after 10 mins though n my face did not feel tight
didn't want to worry about my flaky skin
it's easy to wash off
doesn't irritate my sensitive skin in the slightest
even when i don't have eczema i use this mask once a week because it leaves my skin so soft
this will be just perfect if you have really oily skin or mostly oily skin like mine
it's quite light weight
it's so much less nd looks like a glow rather than a frying pan
didn't super oily at all
tried it with a mattifying moisturizer as well as on it's own
i find i don't get shiny throughout the day
that's the dilemma i'm sure all oily girls struggle with
doesn't make my face look oily at all highly suggest
i typically just use this moisturizer when i know i won't be wearing any foundation that day
i really recommend this for people with oily skin
it's so lightweight that it absorbs quickly when you massage it into your skin
it's not "sticky" feeling.
the only downside, it stinks!
i think it smells like stale cigarette smoke.
easy to wash it off.
it hydrates my face just enough so that it isn't producing more oil to overcompensate for dry skin like with my other moisturizer
most moisturizers tend to make me break out or just add to my oiliness during the day
it’s like a little drink for your skin.
would always go for the really rich moisturizers which didn't help with my oily spots
i would recommend to anyone who has combination/oily skin to try this out
it's great for oily/combination skin.
i get really oily on my tzone
regular moisturizer everywhere else
all my zits are gone
this is the only one that truly keeps my hyper-shiny skin at bay allllllll day
not oily all day long
i would consider my skin to be combination with an oily t-zone
my doesn't look overly greasy
which is handy, because this stuff isn't cheap!
nothing that some blotting papers or powder can't fix
for oily skin may be it will be work good
a primer for a really matte base before i apply my makeup
doesn't peel or pill like some mattifying products do when you layer them over one another
it doesn't feel like a moisturizer after i put it on
isn't too heavy on my skin
this is a great moisturizer if you don't want to look shiny
it's almost not going to be hydrating enough
it's fine for now
i may have to use it for days i don't want to wear makeup because it's almost drying in a way
low for a moisturizer that didn't make me super shiny by lunch time
i like this type of product to make my face feel like it's naked
it does not feel like it's suffocating my pores
it is not greasy
just know that it is not for oily or combination skin types
it'll make you too oily
i needed a cream light enough that my skin can breath
i do not have flakey or ashy skin anywhere
it's like my skin is drinking water
it basically cured my skin
you wouldn't believe how many products i've tried that were supposed to moisturize my skin
i also loooove that it doesn't smell like i rubbed my face all over perfume samples
it doesn't come out too sticky
this cream does exactly what it says: it soothes
it is not greasy.
love that is does not have any nasty chemicals.
doesn't just sit on the surface of my skin
it's great for midday touchups when i can feel my morning moisturizer start to fade
it doesn't feel heavy
but i love the smell and it's not overpowering.
it seems to not sink in my face
it's too oily for the day
doesn't make my skin break out
which is you have dermatitis or excema you know that our condition thrives
it breaks out occasionally
red bumps that form when i don't use enough moisturizer
i also can't forget the very unattractive flaky looking texture around my mouth
if you want a light weight moisturizer or have very oily skin this is probably not for you
it's a little too heavy to wear under makeup
it doesn't feel heavy once it absorbs
it's good for all types of skins
it does not leave you oily or greasy
it does not lightens dark undereye circles
i love how you don't need to dip your fingers in it to apply it
i don't really see a difference in the lightening of my undereye circles
i did not the day i used this because it does appear to have orange pigment in it
didn't like wearing makeup to cover them
she also tends to have violent reactions to any product that her skin doesn't like
it's the only dark circle product i've found that works
it's not a magic eraser
while this product does not completely cover the dark circles beneath my eyes
what it comes down to is that it is amazing to hide your flaws
i didn't experience any irritation or burning with this product
do still have somewhat dark circles under my eyes when i don't get enough sleep
i've found that i don't use quite as much concealer as i used to
sometimes i don't even need concealer!
of course it's not a total eraser
i usually put this on
wait 5-10 minutes before applying concealer because it's a little oily after application
it's not moisturizing so you'll need something separate for that
does lighten some darkness a bit
really there is no makeup or cream that is going to cure them because the shadows are related to the structure of my face
i actually no longer have to use concealer!
" it is not going to cover dark circles the way a concealer covers
you'll still need a traditional concealer
continue to use because it's a decent eye cream for the price point
just doesn't get ride of circles.
extra nice when you don't have on makeup
it's instantly made my dark circles pretty much unnoticeable
i don't have dark circles
it's supposed to make under eye skin thicker
any kind of fragrance or too many chemicals causes lots of irritation
my also unfortunate natural underye circles didn't fail to co yeast against my porcelain complexion
i find myself applying less cover up which means my makeup is less cakey
this is the only thing that will work on my stubborn dark circles
i am an asian woman who has had too much sun exposure which has left me with some hard to conceal dark spots
i hope it'll get rid of all all acne
i don't pair it with a moisturizer because it's too much for my skin
even the matching seaberry cleansing oil is amazing if you're too scared to run oil on your face like i was
then apply a gel or stick blush
i must say that i was a bit skeptical about using an oil since a have combination to oily skin
it doesn't sting me at all
looks a lot less greasier than other oils i've tried like the ufo
it's a staple in my skin care routine.
t doesn't overcompensate with oil
i never thought i'd find something to reduce my oiliness
i usually add a drop or two to my moisturizer.
i often use this at night over a good moisturizer
i love how it doesn't make my face feel greasy
it doesn't seem to address redness
its not one of this weird oils that just sits on top of your skin
if anything it helps my acne instead of causing it
doesn't make you look oily or greasy
doesn't affect the wear of my makeup
i usually put it on by itself if i want or think i need the extra moisture
sometimes in the day
it does not leave my skin oily at all
it's not greasy at all and it's very gentle.
sometimes i use it alone
it does have a weird smell
i also add a stop to any bad acne spots at night
it doesn't make me look greasy
my skin doesn't feel dry anymore at all.
i've started skipping moisturizer since this because it's does it all for me
and it doesn't leave a residue on my skin.
it doesn't linger and it's not strong either.
you really can't smell it unless you put the open bottle up to your nose
some of the other oils were either too watery or has an unpleasant smell
it's no longer itchy
it might be better if you're not mixing it with moisturizer
the smell is light enough
i can't even pick a favourite face oil
makes me feel like it's sucking the wrinkles out.
it is the only facial oil that doesn't cause me to break out
i noticed that my face doesnt peel anymore.
i face usually peel every week
mouth as they get flaky no matter what i do
i don't need this giant bottle!
like to carry it around in my purse for quick flakey fixes
it did help with texture: my skin is no longer super oily or super dry
this oil somehow makes it less oily
although i look like such a grease ball when i go to bed
doesn't break out my combination skin.
it's actually helped my oil production to decrease
the smell is a little odd though
great at removing all makeup even water proof mascara
i noticed that my pores did not clog as much
it does not make my face feel oily.
not greasy at all
which is typical for me to have it on my nose
it's not fixed overnight
when i think oil i think of greasy
it's almost wet and just absorbs into your skin.
some i think are gimmicky
it doesn't provide the hydration-this is a tad bit thicker
i could go without moisturizer-as well it makes makeup look so glowy-i use byterry foundation
i love any moisture an oil or cream can provide however i need it to sink in
it doesn't leave my face feeling greasy or oily.
dont be scared away from oil if you gave oily skin
it doesn't make my skin fell too oily
nothing works as magically as this does
need an oil that won't cause break outs
not greasy feeling at all
it's my first time using face oil
amazingly rich & doesn't clog my pores!
i don't feel like it clogs my pores at all
does not make my combo skin greasy.
it does make your face shine
this one doesn't leave my skin shinny in the morning
doesn't sit heavy by any means
it has a great bottle dropper so you aren't dipping dirty fingers to apply
the only breakouts i get are hormonal or from bad habits
also my pore strips are low key super depressing because there's never anything on them anymore
weren't super super dark they were acne scars from when i didn't stop picking at something i shouldn't have
it's help even out texture
i can only use it 1x a day or else my skin gets dried out
doesn't make me break out unlike many other serums
i don't have any dark sports or pigmentation so can't speak in that area
it's easy to mix with other serums or treatments because it's so light
feel like i'm not blotchy
i now just use a little concealer under my eyes
what it's done for my texture
maybe some evening of texture
i did notice that my skin seemed less dull
also, does not make me oily at all.
i need something for my dull skin
doesn't irritate the skin
if you're not using retin-a
this was amazing but only if i slathered it on.
i don't have to use it often
the regular crummy kind you can muck with trying eye creams that promise youth in 28 days or pay cash for plastic surgery
if you find yourself breaking out from this product
let your skin get used to it.
its actually helped get rid of pimples
there's no irritation or dryness
i don't like the smell
try not to use in the daytime unless you have a very strong spf day cream
i did not find it too drying or irritating
it is light and not sticky feeling.
i bet most of the people do not realize that even a brief exposure to sun will vamp up melanin production
it is pure without a whole lot of filler ingredients
even before applying any makeup my skin looks amazing
it also doesn't burn or sting
just starting to get the slightest wrinkle around my eyes
i can go without makeup
not at all irritating
now it looks like i'm wearing concealer when i'm actually wearing nothing
not only did it work insanely fast at getting rid of my acne
you can use it as a primer too
i didn't have to blot or powder my face all day!
my pores are huge making me a bit acne-prone so this product did the trick
this product is amazing to get rid of texture
doesn't help too much with redness.
i suggest giving this combo a try for anyone with stubborn acne
it does not necessarily help with redness or healing
it is sulfur based, so yes.
if you like clear skin
the oily "i" zone i call mine is so hard to control
it didn't leave a horrible sulfur smell on my skin like other products do
i usually only use this mask on serious pimples that will not go away
it's also pretty smelly from the sulfur
it's the only thing i count on to get rid of acne
so over the summer my skin tends to get extra greasy/oily
i rarely need to blot my face
if you use a small amount as a primer it will keep your t zone shine free all day
now it doesn't make acne disappear overnight
you will need to blend it in well if you're going to use it during the daytime
i still use a tiny bit of my becca ever-matte primer around my nose area for added insurance
i didn't find it overpowering
they don't magically disappear
i would only recommend using this as a mask if you suffer from oily skin
of course it didn't make my spots vanish
when i use this product under my makeup my face isn't oily
you can of course still smell the sulphur
you can even use a tiny bit as a primer for days you really need your makeup to last if you have very oily skin
minus the odd pimple here
i would avoid using it as a primer if your skin isn't very oily though
this stuff takes the redness
a little stinky but it does have sulfur in it.
it's not a boulder like it would be
ditched my primer i believe it was causing breakouts on my cheeks anyhow
i even got a sample of the green liquid stuff to try
some people don't like sulfur
i hardly have staples in my beauty routine
it's the end of summer
it does not really dry so you may wake up with some of it under your fingertips
it really does work especially when salicylic acid doesn't work for mature acne
it warms on contact but it's not really a mask?
because i decided to give this sulfur mask a try
weird about it using it under makeup
i just recommend after washing to use a facial oil or good moisturizer so the skin doesn't get too dry
i don't know what it is --- i have used many sulfur masks
which means it doesn't entirely stink or dry out the skin
i've tried so many products for my mild acne.
there's only one issue
lots of those weird clogged-pore
pimple doesn't disappear over night
the product also doesn't stink as bad as most sulfur products out there
these days all it does for me is seem to bring pimples to a head by churning the cells inside the pore
doesn't really prevent the huge pimples
i can't stop touching my face.
i simply apply this, go to sleep and voila!
i do not have acne prone skin
i love the way it has been pulling the gross stuff out of my pores
i can’t use these without my skin going red
i also apply it to my nose creases every night since i am prone to really painful
it's main ingredient is sulfur so that's to be expected
they're gone in a day
it's fine to sleep on it
use it i suggest getting a good moisturizer to counter the little drones that occurs
now the smell i snot pleasant like they say
so be ready for a icky stintch
i don't see where it lists lavender oil
i love that it's kind of a 3 in 1 product: you can apply a thick layer
i will occasionally break out as the result of eating something i shouldn't
even with regular facials the blackheads on my nose just won't go away
it's so easy to use also.
it won't be messy at all
if you use only a little bit on a pimple
the only complaint i havens that it definitely has that sulfur smell to it
i prefer sulfur based products over others because it doesn't burn or irritate the skin
you'll get treatment all day :
have you got those deep blemishes that just don't want to come to the surface or go away?
i wanted to try something else to control my hormonal acne
it's not a cheap habit
underneath your makeup as a primer is worth it if you have a backlog of stuff on your face
you'll notice a difference in your skin
even a dollop on a burgeoning pimple does wonders overnight
anyways a big under the skin pimple formed
i can't see using it during the day as a primer
i don't mind using it as a spot treatment or mask
you can use it as a mask
my skin was still so greasy
they dont try to cover the smell up
the pimples would not go away
needed something for my occasional breakout
i can't help noticing it
i know it's pricey
it's as if my skin has been hungover all it's life
you really only need a small dab!
i want the face wash too
my skin never look so dewy
it's not super moisture feeling on my face
i know their stuff is pricey
i don't think i've ever come across anything this velvety soft in my life
this creme somehow relieves my chapped raw skin it doesn't sting
this does not clog my pores either
i don't have bad skin
my wrinkles seem to have gone away
this gets 5 stars for not burning my skin
that's an easy fix, a spotted face is not.
drool over what i couldn't afford
at least i'll have great skin while he's giving me the stink eye
'm not sure about the anti-aging effects
does not feel heavy or greasy
you won't like the smell
i tend to break out a lot on my chin so this was recommended by the rep of amore
doesn't feel greasy or icky
does not cause irritations
t's hard to find one creme
not abrasive its a must try
$200 cream is not very punk rock
doesn't leave any greasy residue
i can't speak on the anti-aging effects because i don't really have wrinkle problems
it's all i need
doesn't make the oily parts worse
it's all i need
it's all i need
it's all i need
it's all i need
it's all i need
it's all i need
it's all i need
it's all i need
it's all i need
it's all i need
it's all i need
it's all i need
it's all i need
it's all i need
it's all i need
it's all i need
it's all i need
it's all i need
it's all i need
it's all i need
it's all i need
it's all i need
it's all i need
my skin is not flaky anymore
this product really is not for oily or combination skin
love the smell too.
don't waste your money if you are oily
this product is thick but it doesn't feel greasy.
this product is soothing without being anything
darn if it doesn't give my skin the most amazing glow
i don't mind the smell
this is a nice cream, however i won't buy.
the cleaning oil anyway
i think my skin hasn't been as oily as it usually is
this stuff doesn't irritate my skin
i can't describe the smell entirely
you get used it after awhile or force yourself to ignore the smell since the product is so wonderfully moisturizing
especially when you've been using other moisturizers
scents usually bother me
you'd pay this much for a couple of facials
heavy cream that doesn't feel heavy on
you feel the thickness on your h
coming out of the jar yet it's weightless after application
it's nice to have some pre-dream pampering-i wake up to soft
although the smell does fade after about an hour or so
you don't need a lot to cover your face
and it's not greasy at all !
can't tell if it lightens dark marks yet
also this product doesn't irritate
i hate having to put on powder everyday.
it's too pricey right now
i hate when serums are way too thick
that it wasn't so pricy
i don't like the pump
so seems that there may be some tint in it.
don't lose product between my fingers
it did not brighten my skin
it's tricky to pump out
if you pump it normally
it's light enough to use under my spf moisturizer
hoping for something to give my dull/blah skin a bit of oomph
i can't wait to get the moisturizer to see the combined effects of it
this stuff somehow keeps my oil at bay while brightening
i am not blotting excessively like usual
just don't care for how it squirts out of the container
this is the only one that didn't leave a sticky residue
helps even out my skin tone
this is a nice smelling product that doesn't irritate my skin
i don't have to use an acne treatment any more for my t-zone
did not wow me like the rose facial over night cream did
i don't get much sleep
give it a try if you have a bit of puffy
if you use to much it may irritate your eyes.
my only complaint is that the lotion doesn't stay put
can creep into my eyes irritating them
really does work for the instant effects
i always feel the need to go for more watery type of eye creams
which i feel gets evaporated anyways
i can't even feel the bagginess under my eyes anymore
because if i use too much it tends to seep into my eyes
i dont need concealer anymore
it doesn't erase or reduce the lines that i already have though
it usually bothers my eyes
it's one of the more natural ones
using too much can leave a cakey appearance.
i do not have dark circles or bags under my eyes
however it does sting if you get some in your eye
sucks that you can't get it near your eyelids
puffiness so decided to give it a try thinking that if it makes it bright then the puffiness will not show as much
just a dab is all you need
i've tried a lot of stuff in the effort to make me look slightly less like the undead
this is good for me because i don't like to wear make up other than occasional mascara
it's definitely a toss up between this
doesn't feel too thick
doesn't make my concealer slick off
i wear it under my makeup
i usually don't believe any products that claim to get rid or smooth under-eye dark circles
it is light enough not to clog my pores
it doesn't make my t-zone oily
its not a heavy cream apt for winter months.
it doesn't irritate my skin or make my more oily.
it's gentle enough that it doesn't irritate my face while still keeping it from drying out
it feels like you're putting almost nothing on your skin
doesnt leave any sort of residue
doesn't make your skin feel sticky
it didn't feel overly greasy or heavy
i like that you can't feel it on your skin.
you don't have to be afraid if you have oily skin
neither of them breaks me out or gives me any white bumps
it's done wonders for my skin
it doesn't have a scent
it doesn't just sit on top of your skin
this is a good moisturizer to use when you're not using something with an spf
doesn't leave a greasy feeling
this moisturizer does not break me out or make my acne worse whatsover
i can not use another moisturizer under my makeup except this one
too heavy or have a horrible smell
this is good for sensitive skin as it doesn't cause redness or irritate at all
it is light and not greasy at all.
it doesn't have any really anti-aging benefits
oil free that wouldn't cause me to break out
i know that is bad for your hair
s it bad for you skin too?
i tend to have acne and it doesn't clog pores.
i don't usually put anything on my face anymore in the daytime since every product that i have used causes me to either sweat or sweat more
however this product just wasn't thick enough
even out my skin
i don't feel greasy or like i have a ton of product on after i apply
it gives just enough moisture without being too heavy or greasy
i can't see myself using any other moisturizer during fall/winter time
this is great to use when my skin is normal or oily
doesn't cause my sensitive skin to break out
this one gets absorbed into my skin without that greasy feel
doesn't make me look flawless
it is the perfect basic moisturizer that never irritates me
doesn't weigh down my skin
i love that its so simple
the pump dispenser is great because you can't contaminate the lotion with all your germs
not greasy in the least
i can use it on my eyes
n winter because otherwise they can make your face a bit oily
doesn't irritate my acne prone skin
it does not irritate my skin
doesn't bother my rosacea
i especially appreciate that it's fragrance-free.
doesn't leave me feeling oily
you don't have to use a lot to moisturize your face
i love the way this doesn't leave my face feeling oily
the only downside is it's not spf.
sure it's a bit pricey
you will get kinda oily
doesn't every feel heavy or thick on your face
it's the first moisturizer i've used that hasn't made me break-out
use enough to moisturize your entire face
i find that i only use it at night because it tends to leave my skin a bit greasy/tacky for hours
this moisturizer is a little on the heavy side for me
t doesn't feel too heavy
love the packaging so you don't overuse the product
not feel oily like other products i used
with an oily yet somehow always dry t-zone
doesnt feel greasy once applied.
some reviews say that this stuff makes your face greasy-this moisturizer isn't for oily skin
normally he doesn't pick up on r
they are either too greasy or not enough moisture at all
it feels like it's lightening up my malasma a bit
the only reason i'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because i feel it's too heavy
i feel it makes my skin too shiny for day
i decided to try this cream because i used to have pretty oily skin
i don't normally rave about products
i usually do not like using moisturizers because they tend to make my face oily
this moisturizer doesn't do this!
i don't know if it brightens
wouldn't feel heavy or tacky
it doesn't feel dry anymore
yet doesn't feel heavy
it makes my face quite oily during the day
it does not leave your skin feeling greasy
i am not using the toner that goes with it as i found it to be too harsh
it's sounds like a lot of layers
sometimes forgetting at night
though my skin is not really oily anymore
although i hope i don't break the glass bottle
most moisturizers even unfragrenced sometimes give me bad reactions
most products that i want to use for my oily skin
enlarged pores just seem to break me
so do the pimples
i like what it did to my pores on my nose too
feels a little tingling it almost resembles the texture of make up when applied to the skin because it's thicker than other creams
you can actually see stuff being sucked out of your pores as the mask dies lighter in color
it simply tingles and feels so fresh!
skip the expensive facials, this just does it!
man do my breakouts shrink when i use this
like i can't use neutrogena
i find this mask helps a lot with your skin complexion
my skin doesn't feel oily after using this product
this stuff burns like all get out
it's more like a burning sensation
if you can get past the burning i promise you'll fall in love with the results
for first 2 mins it hurts like you've hot sauce on your face
this is everything if you are combo/oily like me!
it only tingled like it's suppose to.
not as much as when i used a thick layer
didnt irritate me at all
$69 is ridiculous for a mask.
won't blame the mask entirely for that
i can't wait to try the hydrating mask next
this mask doesn't bother my skin at all
it's important to exfoliate your skin whether you're dry or oily
because otherwise you'll end up with dead skin blocking your moisturizer from soaking in
it does sting a bit
it's made my face super clean
afterwards my skin looks more like it's had some kind of chemical peel done
as it's hard to think about emotional distress when it feels like your cheeks are melting off
some of the reviews said the tingle/burn can be really intense on certain skin types
just pay attention to how much it tingles cuz you could be allergic
noticed everyone hates the tingle/burn
if your going to get rid of wrinkles it going to hurt
(you feel it, but it doesn't burn.)
i love using this when my skin feels clogged.
my skin does feel a tiny bit irritated after
if you're looking to get your first facial mask
it's a tingling feeling not burning
i can't get over the smell of supermud
but i don't think it's uncomfortable.
no other exfoliator/peel/mask has ever made my skin look so great
think that the plant matter really has no function aside from being a cheap filler
i feel like i could do without all the filler
this mask makes your face feel like a million bucks
i don't know if you get used to it or if it gets easier because your skins cleaner
when you remove it you can feel that your skin is smoother
that it's a bit messy
i love harsh exfoliators because i feel the dead skin going away
i do not have as many pimples
my skin is not as red
it's not for overly sensitive or damaged skin so don't try it if you're in that bucket
my skin doesn't shed dead skin properly
it's so expensive for such a little jar
when you first apply the product it isn't so much of a tingle as it is a burn
i love to indulge in thirsty mud immediately after as it dries you out
origins charcoal make doesn't even compare
it makes your skin tingle as it works on your face
it isn't just a tingle for me
i seem to get a couple extra uses out of each jar
can't wait to try the full line of glamglow masks
have to remove it asap because my face feels like it has a flamethrower on it
all of those were drugstore-ish
this one contains 'french sea clay' which didn't irritate my skin whatsoever
i didn't feel a "tingling" sensation most likely because of this
i don't even have bad dark circles
when will i ever not have dark or puffy eyes?
that a lot of people didn't read the instructions on how to wipe some of the serum on the lip of the bottle before application
if you need to de-puff then this is your safe haven
i like how it hightlights my eye area making it seem fresh
it has a light fragrance that does not irritate my eyes
the dark circles reduced so much that i don't need concealer to cover them up anymore
how can i lose my terrible dark circles by just sleeping a lil early for 3 days?
it's definitely effective in getting rid of most of my puffiness with its cool touch
can get away with a much less "heavy duty " concealer
i think that the applicator is bit dumb
now i enjoy using the cool tool all around the eye as a little mini massage
eye creams aren't really my area of focus
it is a bit thick so you got to get used to how the applicator works
it won't seem so fidgety
it's more like a gel than a cream
i like how the pearl end has that little massaging ability
ignore all the reviews that say about it drying out your skin
several of the genefique products seem to have the property of making one's skin glow from within
the applicator does make you use too much
a light scent that does not linger long
not greasy at all
didn't sneeze at all
not greasy on my skin
can't use a lot of products
a little dab is enough to cover my entire face
while the packaging is nice it's actually counterproductive since it's see through
does not linger on your skin
absorbs so quickly i don't even need to wash my h
when i apply the product it smells so clean
it's really a luxury product
i do find that i need to use an exfoliating face wash more often than before
it doesn't feel heavy or greasy at all
it does make my face a tad more shiny than i would like for a daytime look
one tip--you'll want to make sure that you are exfoliating once/twice a week
you'll see the effects of the creme sooner
most moisturizers seems to leave my face looking a little red
i can't say that spots are disappearing.
it doesn't cause breakouts
isn't greasy or too heavy
it's not sticky or greasy.
not over powering which i like especially since my allergies can be bothered by certain scents
my skin was so smooth i couldn't stop touching it
even though it's expensive
with sk-ii it's not getting oily
it's almost like a plumping effect.
i still found myself endlessly tweaking my skin care routine to get that elusive "complete effect" result
it does help if you either tone or exfoliate your skin regularly because when i don’t
not greasy or heavy at all
it doesn't give your skin a sticky feeling
i love how it just sinks into my skin
not greasy or sticky feeling at all
i don't wear makeup
the price tag on this may be scary
did not cause breakouts although my skin didn't have any hidden gunk in it
it's most likely because your skin is pushing all the gunk out of your pores
my skin was so smooth i couldn't stop touching it
it did not make me oily
it's almost vaseline-like texture melts completely into my skin after a few minutes
it does not leave my skin oily
someone would inevitably tell me that my skin looked glowy or dewy
it's more of a gel consistancy.
if you overwork it into the skin it does begin to flake off
i am not having issues with wrinkles
doesn't exacerbate my rosacea
you do not feel that heavy feeling that you get with some moisturizers especially ones that are anti-aging
the only reason i did not give sk-ii facial lift emulsion 5 stars is because i do not know if the price makes it practical for most people
it was not overpowering at all
this product does leave me looking like i have a little sheen on my face
it hasn't changed how my makeup looks or lasts
i don't necessarily need anti-wrinkle creams
doesn't leave it greasy
doesn't irritate my skin
it is by far the best hydrating beauty product i have used that doesn't seen heavy when applied
my acne doesn't come out as much
i also love that it doesn't contain gmos or sulfates
they don't seem to be diminishing
i love that it doesn't make my skin more oily
you can see your skin getting firmer.
you use before you put on your moisturizer
it doesn't leave any irritation
doesn't leave me shiny
or so tag for clear stuff in a bottle
it somehow manages to be rich
it actually makes the face cleaning session a pleasant one
it's not drying at all
i may still repurchase it because i like my pores stay clean
it a bit pricey for a face wash
it cleanses but doesn't overdry.
i've used practically every product out there for acne prone skin
i won't skimp out as much haha
this cleanser cleans pretty well without leaving a residue or a feeling that i still have dirt/whatever on my face
yet it takes off all of my makeup without stripping my skin
you'll only need a little bit of it
it wasn't overpowering, though.
if you can't spend much on the cosmetics
so am not a newbie to using oil instead of face wash to remove makeup
i like how the consistency changes when you rinse with water instead of staying an oily consistency
i will sometimes have a bit of eye makeup left
this doesn't completely remove it or my regular mascara
i typically have to start with a makeup remover wipe then wash with this
it wont leave your face oily?
usually to remove my makeup
needless to say i will be only purchasing this cleansing oil to clean my face
it hasn't clogged that up like coconut oil used to whatsoever
my pores aren't clogged anymore
it just doesn't look very fancy
my skin doesn't feel dried out after like it normally does after washing
there isn't so much a foaming reaction
now that i have this cleansing oil it's a one step process to clean it all off
add a bit of water for a little bit of foaming action
while i don't think it would be best for me to use every day because of my oily skin
sk ii cleansing oil is just the perfect thing to take out all the makeup
it's also great for combo or oily skin!
i don't need to use makeup wipes to wipe off makeup b4 using this
those are just little things that don't detract from the fact that this is great facial cleanser
which looks super fancy on my counter.
i don't need an extra cleanser after using this
it's easy to use and dispense from the bottle.
doesn't make your face feel oily afterwards
it also doesn't make your skin feel dry
i just can't use it more than 2 times a week otherwise acne appears
though oily, it did not seem thick.
it is almost too slimy
i cannot tell when i can stop rinsing
i just appreciate cleansers that don't strip the skin so much :d
the consistency is just right without being too watery or thick
really gets rid of stubborn makeup
it does blur your vision for a minute until you can wash it off so contact wearers
you dont realize you are using an oil to cleanse
or not thick enough
i've tried oils that were the perfect consistency yet wouldn't remove my eye makeup
then add a little water to get the product to really emulsify
you barely need 2 pumps to get your face clean so while it may be expensive
makeup simply dissolves in it's path with a little rubbing
although it does remove makeup
i've found it's best to follow up with a normal cleanser to really make sure your face is squeaky clean
how it doesn't strip all the oils out of my face
if you use waterproof eye makeup you may want to use an eye makeup remover to be thorough
my face didn't feel greasy after applying the cream
just a dab will do you!
if you don't go overboard
just use the pearl sized amount you will supply your face with just enough moisture to not be too greasy
there is delicate a scent that doesn't bother me.
if you like rich texture creams this is a nice pick for you
you may not enjoy the drenching this cream does to your skin
it's easy to use under makeup.
it doesn't irritate my skin at all
can't comment on the effect of anti-aging
otherwise when i did my makeup immediately after applying the cream i looked way too dewy
/or like a dewy look this cream could be for you
did not leave a greasy feeling on my face
i did not feel like lotion was dripping into my eyes
it is a bit greasy
you don't need to be heavy with using the cream you only need a little dab
have a hard time finding a moisturizer that doesn't leave my t zone overly oily
you will have a greasy feeling on your face
it is not overpowering at all
luckily my makeup foundation does contain it
typically i end up losing the spatula because there's no where to put it
i would scream if i caught anyone wasting this pricy stuff on the palms of their h
only bad thing about this cream is that its a little heavy to use in the summer with sunscreen
i can't attest to the wrinkles because i luckily don't have any wrinkles yet
it feels like this isn't your typical moisturizer or packaging
that scooper will make it easy to get the all of the product out of it so none gets left behind
can't find the one that makes your skin up to your st
i also don't have any fine lines or wrinkles on my skin
i also don't care for fancy packaging
so taking to much of this cream makes my skin extra oily
for now it's too heavy for my combo skin
the fragrance is light and not bothersome at all.
it comes with a little scooper so you don't have to use you fingers to take some cream out of the jar
will give you a dewy look that lasts all day
i much prefer the dropper.
every so often i will get a blemish
i think it helped to soften my laugh lines a bit
it does seem a bit pricy
if it can prevent me from wanting to try a cosmetic treatment it's worth it
does not feel like typical serum
this one does not have heavy fragrance
does not leave skin greasy at all
doesn't leave a sticky or tacky finish
once it's dried you won't feel sticky on the face
maybe i have to use it longer to see the effects on my forehead
i don't have a lot of wrinkle either
it feels a little tacky at first
it seems a little sticky at first
my laugh lines are so minimal
it leaves a tacky feel at first then soaks into skin
it is a little bit tacky after applying so make sure if you're going to use it you give it an appropriate amount of dry down time before applying makeup
it never feels heavy on the skin
it's like a drink of water for your skin.
i can see some evening of my skintone
it is like looking at myself through a good filter except i don't need the filter
i'll admit there's a bit of sticker-shock at first
think of all the money you waste of products to hide imperfections
i love the difference it's made on my skin.
you can't just slap in on under your makeup
my makeup doesn't sit as well
it did not make my face feel greasy or slick
sometimes it felt a bit "tacky
i don't even want to wear makeup over my skin
this doesn't irritate my skin or exacerbate my eczema
it does not leave a residue
i know it's pricey
doesn't make you feel weighed down
it's hard to find a moisturizer that works for me through the night
i only use it on my lids though
sometimes when i find another eye cream that works wonders under my eye i try it on my lids
i like to think of it as an invisible bra for my eyelids so they don’t have to fight against gravity as hard
probably because it can’t grip the skin with another cream
there's been a lot of lift in my cheeks
it sinks in quickly so you can put your eye makeup on without worrying about smudges
don't have any wrinkles
not at all irritating to my eye area
i think this is helping in getting rid of the puffiness permanantly
my make up doesn't cake up or crease anymore.
doesn't irritate my eyes either.
it's thick enough that you only have to use a dab
am prone to puffiness so unfortunately there is no quick fix
it sounds a bit silly
it doesn't smell, nor does it irritate my skin.
my lids are not puffy anymore
the stinging isn't that bad
i wouldn't call it a burning at all
just enough that i had to be a little more vigilant with my acne-fighting cleansing/face masks/etc
it's a little on the pricy side
so once it's worked it's magic
it's also getting rid of her under eye fat bags.
not oily or greasy just enough.
while this mask is on i can see it sucking out oil
i can't stop looking at my face in the mirror.
this mask really does pull out blackheads
i usually use a nose
you'll notice that more gross stuff gets pulled out than when you do it without this mask
the mask does burn a bit
maybe it's the peppermint oil in it that makes it burn
so don't put it under your eyes.
it's not a miracle cure
will not fix a pimple on the spot
i cannot tell you how many products i have tried to get rid of my blackheads
sometimes an all over depending on my acne
i believe it's part of what makes this so potent because willowbark is naturally high in a chemical exfoliator bha
you can see all the gross stuff it sucked out of your pores on the surface
when i apply it it stings a bit
whats great about it is that you can use it as a spot treatment to remove stubborn white heads
doesn't make your face red for long after you take it off
honey let me tell you about my clogged pores
i couldn't tell where the pimple was
i love how you can literally see it cleaning out your pores my husb
you can also use it as spot treatment on any pimples
it legit sucks the life out of the blemish
only glamglow mask that doesn't contain an ingredient to break me out
you really see your gross pores
i literally have never found a mask that didn't make me break out or more oily
don't because of this mask
literally everything irritates it.
do not get blackheads or pimples it's just my actual skin in bumpy
it is so annoying
when it starts to dry you can't move your face
it's almost like i can feel my pores opening up
even with a mattifying primer it's just not balanced
it's helped remove so many blackheads i had on my nose
a smooth formula with some odd chunks in it lol
it dries so you know when to wash it off
you can also see the areas where it's sinking into your pores as it's drying
i mean everything from pores
does wonders for my acne prone skin.
it seems like most cleaning mask do that
i know it's this because i have tried everything under the sun for my acne
you have to wash your face after you use this mask
the chunks of tea leaves are a bit weird to me
idk if my skin is supposed to feel like it's burning
not only do you see immediate results after rinsing off the mask
i don't often review on beauty/skin products
it definitely reduces/eliminates any acne i have even if it's somewhat below the very surface of my skin
i also actually really love that it isn't a peel off mask because that stress on your skin messes with your elasticity over time
i pretty much loathe black licorice
i am diligent enough with my make up / skincare that i don't break out too often
i'd rather have my face smell like dog poo any day
i honestly have no words for how soft my skin felt after washing this mask off
nothing clears my skin like this
doesn't irritate my skin whatsoever
it doesn't irritate my skin
it really does pull out the gunk living in your skin
there's nothing like having a day full of makeup
because it's so expensive i'm going to try a fresh mask for a while
the moisturizer is thick which made me wonder if it would be heavy
does not leave my face feeling sticky or shiny
the only product i've found that doesn't pill under my face
minus one star because it may not be hydrating enough during the winter
fortunately you don't have to use a lot to hydrate skin
it doesn't leave me that greasy
tacky film that lots of other moisturizers tend to leave
summer that i don't get super oily
i totally recommend trying that if the treatment alone doesn't keep your skin from drying out
it's been the only thing that magically works while i sleep to truly hydrate
the only con is that it sometimes can be very irritating to my eyes when they're open
it's difficult to find a moisturizer thats gentle
at night it is gentle enough to put on my eyes as we'll
don't want your makeup getting oily after a long day
i occasionally intersperse its use with other products just to see if there's anything better out there
it does not become "drying" or feel "gel-like"
i will probably layer on another moisturizer on top because it's really windy where i live
my face tends to get a little chapped
i rarely ever get whiteheads.
whenever i applied something to my skin
also my blemishes didn't quite look like acne
it does not leave my face feeling greasy.
i went into origins to actually get the mega mushroom cleanser
it is lightweight and doesn't feel heavy.
is the only part that usually gets greasy during the day
i love how it hydrates my skin right away
i can't tell the difference between this moisturizer
does not feel greasy
i love the way this applies on a freshly cleansed face it doesn't leave an oily film like some cleaners do
saves my skin, and i can wear it under my makeup!
doesn't make my t-zone too greasy
while i tend to have combination skin this has given me no issues with break outs or extra oiliness
doesn't feel greasy at all on my normal-oily skin
doesn't feel greasy or too heavy
it is not greasy
not greasy at all once it absorbs
love the smell, feel, and spread of this.
you might end up with a greasy face if you apply to much
this product before i apply anything makes my face look airbrushed
it does not seem to irritate or cause breakouts
on my dark skin alone it tends to be a bit shiny
it doesn't smell bad for me
smell is a bit herbal-y but not too bad.
it's quite small- i can easily fit it in my hand.
can't even have air fresheners around without getting a headache
doesn't make my very oily skin worse
probably because they're not full of garbage from less superior moisturizers
it's so dry that it looks like fuzz
it smells like a cleaning product when you put it on
every product i use either feels like water or is too oily
don't let the the extremely thick consistency scare you though
will a little powder your skin will look perfect
he says it doesn't feel thick or heavy on
if you don't mind applying toilet cleaner smell to your face
my face just looks like i have glow not an oil slick like it usually would
i would definitely recommend this product to anyone who suffers from oily skin
makeup doesn't like to stay
with this product you get rid of oil
it's the perfect product for him since he'd never agree to using my oil blotting powder
i tried it on first to prove to him there was no color or scent or anything "girly"
i wasn't shiny i didn't feel greasy no itching
plus it doesn't clog your pores!
which i must admit i was a little concerned about…didn't want to walk around having my face smell like i dipped it in a bowl of cologne
now i don't have to worry about blotting or looking oily
this stuff makes your pores look less noticeable that's why i love it
i couldn't believe my face was not oily for a whole day at work
they're usually the ones that are primers with oil control in them
sticky day here in nyc i can apply it over my makeup for a little end of day touch up
glossy if i don't use this
ladies sometimes it's better to wear the pants
so the tube lasts forever
this is an amazing product if you struggling with oily skin or perma-shine like i do
the alcohol from the pad tones my skin while the moisturizer does what's obvious
does not feel oily at all when applied.
the only reason i can't give this product five stars is because even with regular use of facial cleansers it still caused me to break out when i typically have no problems
i don't feel greasy
doesn't make it oily
it's been a long process
as you only need 3 drops for your whole face
just a few drops on your face makes it dewy
i usually like put a few drops onto my beauty blender
the oil isn't really heavy or anything
or i simply lightly set the places i feel like need to look a bit matte
i does not leave you skin feeling too oily
the smell is no that bad
although this product may seem oily
i add a few drops to the tip of my beauty blender
my skin has been all out of whack due to my pregnancy i normally have very oily skin
doesn't seem to get as oily as usual at all
doesn't leave my face looking oily
it doesn't make my skin oily
without making it greasy
to be honest sometimes especially when it's extra humid i will mix these two together
the smell doesn't linger on my face or anything
the oil leaves your skin feeling satin smooth-i recommend really massaging it into your face when you use it-i use mine at night after a shower when my face is dry
sometimes it's every night
sometimes i take breaks from it
also makes my skin not so red
i can't imagine my routine without them
why does mine drip so much oil fast?
i don't notice a smell.
it's good for my lips.
if you don't have combo/oily skin i think this would be a great oil for you
doesn't have an unpleasant odor
does not settle in wrinkles or pores.
i don't have to put anything else in my coarse
it doesn't give me that crunchy wet look
it doesn't weight it down like you would think given that it's an oil
this oil doesn't feel greasy or heavy on the skin
my face doesn't look as red
it's obvious that it lasts a long time
it is not greasy at all
i don't like the smell
the way i make sure i don't get greasy when i use this is i mix 2-3 drops with my serum
i either use this underneath my moisturizer or mix it right into it usually before bed
it never makes my face more oily
in the mornings i'm not too oily
if i do get a pimple
i never thought i would love an oil because i have oily skin
the only thing i don't like it's the smell
this doesn't feel heavy or greasy
accutane dries out your skin so much
i wouldn't recommend using it in the day because your face does look a little shiny after using it
it's helping me fade acne scars!
my hair amazing results the only thing i don't like is the smell
this is the only thing that gets rid of my acne
it's cleared my skin
can't really tell if this oil is the solution to dullness or uneven skin tone
it's helped to manage my oily skin
'm not overproducing oils
i think it's keeping my acne at bay
not only does it help oily skin
he doesn't suffer from acne
it doesn't break out my sensitive skin
i don't usually use it under my foundation
i wasn't getting really oily in my t zone by the end of the day
the eye dropper feature will make it a sanitary "share" if you don't get careless
touch the dropper to anything while trying it
it's just absorbs right into your skin
don't use this everyday
i don't use it during the day because it's too thick of an oil
it makes my hair so smooth and doesn't feel oily.
it's awkward, but otherwise no complaints.
i don't break out in acne anymore
i don't even use night or morning cream anymore this is the only thing i use to moisturizer my face
my doesn't cause my make up to slide around
my skin didn't feel oily
i don't like to use oil products on my face.
it's not too thick or too oily-feeling
i've honestly never thought about using facial oils
my face isn't super oily either
not a wrinkle on her face
it goes on with no residue
this cream does the trick
it is not shiny when it's absorbed
not oily when you apply it
don't know about anti aging
it's easy on my eyes all day
it's lightweight so i use it day and night.
you can note a difference around your eyes
because it's still winter i require something with a more greasier substance
thought the eye cream couldn't be bad
you're in luck -- this cream doesn't irritate at all
t doesn't feel too too heavy
it isn't greasy or anything
it's not too greasy or oily
its not overly greasy just perfect for laying foundation on
i put a teeny bit on my lips too
it's not sticky and keeps my breakouts at bay!
keep coming back to this as it feels thin enough that it won't clog pores
i didn't feel the need to wear tinted moisturizer everyday
i feel like if i dont have enough moisture my skin will create oil to make up for it -- which is what my skin does with this product
i can finally moisturize without worrying about excessive oil or mid day zits
not greasy at all
it doesn't over hydrate my oily t-zone
is super picky about stuff on his face feeling greasy etc
i love this moisturizer because it's just as advertised -- lightweight
it didn't feel greasy or too intensive
if i only use the product on its own my face doesn't quite have the same dewy look or feel
it doesn't feel heavy like other creams
this cream does the job
i don't like the smell
doesn't make me oily throughout the day like other ones ive tried either
it's not a bad smell
might not be good if you don't like the scent of cucumbers
i can still smell it
t doesn't ruin my makeup
its the only thing that helps me with my hormonal break outs
i don't like heavy face creams so this is great for me
great texture, doesn't leave skin oily.
this smells like cucumber even on my face i still smell it a little
i don't have any wrinkles
your face will feel greasy
it does not make me oily at all.
does not make my face look oily even though i have oily skin
great scent, not too oily.
it's a perfect moisture replenisher without making me oily or irritating existing breakouts
don't have any wrinkles
the jar lasts forever
it never fails to make my skin look plump
somehow it has solved all my skin problems
also doesn't make my face oily
doesn't leave skin oily or heavy
i don't care about smell
not only does this moisturizer prevent premature aging
i can't stop touching it"
that it doesn't say it is ophthalmologist tested
it's thin but not watery.
it doesn't feel greasy or heavy at all
greasy or it felt like it didn't moisturize enough
it's not only balanced my skin
tend to stay away from all moisturizers completely
my face doesn't get extremely oily or breakout
i can't get past the smell
it kind of smells like one of those green juice drinks where you feel like you are drinking a plant
i like it because it does soak into the skin
doesn't sit on top
i find it's not hydrating enough for the winter
not heavy or greasy
sometimes as a moisturizer on its own
it does not leave my skin oily at all.
it's helped smooth out my skin around my eyes
this stuff is a must have for those stubborn lines that just want to show up
light enough to not mess with my makeup
don't have any deep wrinkles just fine lines that aren't a huge deal
it you an afford it=miracle cream
irritate your skin from applying it like 5 times in one day lol
they're big on murad products
i've never had it sting or irritate
three days using this eye cream and they're gone.
it's a next texture and seems to be working.
it doesn't cake up.
irritation does occur if it gets inside my eyes
it's basically a toss up off what will work for your skin
doesn't affect application of makeup
i love the smooth, clear, no -greasy formula too.
i no longer use concealer under my eyes at all
it's funny some other reviewers are noticing the weird feeling of small glass shards
can't speak to the anti-aging effects
it does mine too if i put this on the tops of lids
it never interferes with my eye makeup.
i sometimes use it around my lips.
otherwise it doesn't sting
this product hasn't made my eyes burn
admittedly the lines around my eyes weren't horrible to begin with
i do not have fine lines or wrinkles
yet it doesn't feel greasy
it's smooth and not greasy at all.
i don't have deep wrinkles yet
because it's not greasy
it just melts into your skin.
it's gotten rid of under eye circles
as i always think anti-aging eye cream claims are fake
you'll definitely see results
almost acts like a primer instead of making your make up cake like some eye creams can do
so much so that my concealer just glides on over it
works with my makeup while it's on
already feel like it's smoothed out my dark circles
it can burn your eyes if you rub it when it's just applied
the bumps just wouldn't leave
when you rub it in
my eye area is so sensitive i cannot usually put anything around them without instant redness
it would probably take a real miracle to reduce those nasty crow's feet
doesn't irritate my eyes.
didn't have any burning or uncomfortable sensation
my eyes aren't puffy anymore
it does seem a little thick out of the container
or you'll get too much
that's an easy fix
doesn't irritate the skin or eyes
i can get rid of that easily
you'll get the results
you might want to buy a couple of tubes to completely vanish your scars
i would recommend trying if you have any sort of acne scars
doesn't clog my pours
i would go to any lengths to pop the pimples so that they would "go away
this stuff is like liquid gold.
my face scars really easily
i sometimes even put this product on my acne because it helps reduce the redness
it didn't do much for the deep dark scars
it's easy to use and really light.
doesn't make concealer or makeup look cakey if it's used on top
i usually don't believe anything that claims to get rid of scars
which didn't lighten the scars at all
like where you would get dark circles
the only drawback is the serum sometimes gets stuck when using the rollerball
the scars were so dark you could always kinda see them through the concealer
concealer couldn't quite hide them
the only thing i don't like about this product is it doesn't absorb into skin
i've tried so many different products to get rid of my acne scars with no hope in sight
i would suggest trying it if you have mild scarring
for those of you who say it is sticky
i doesn't dry my skin nor does it burn
it's not a quick solution
don't let the size of the dispenser fool you
i would recommend this product for those who have little/light acne scars
it's nice to finally find a product that reduces the redness
darn those pesky things
you're pealing lots anyway
the scrub really helped remove excess tissue that probably wouldn't of been removed otherwise
i know it's pricey
it's taking awhile for the scars to fade
i don't need to put concealer on my dark spots now
i didn't think anything would diminish the acne scars on my cheeks
i got this on a whim because i like the kate somerville pimple drying solution
it hasn't gotten rid of them completely
i just hated those small bumps
my skin rarely breaks out now!
the packaging is not ideal in that i always end up having to kind of squish the tubing to get every last drop
it's from biting it too much
given that it's an expression line
just because it's so easy
it's nice to do masks
this night cream delivers pronto!
where have i been the last 10 years not really using anything on my face other than sunscreen occasionally
i don't have any wrinkles
it is gentle though so you don't end up with a scaly face though
like the fact that it's also a night cream
it's just the nature of the ingredient.
i don't use it every night because i have normal to oily t zone skin
you only need a little bit of this thick cream
rich so one pump is enough for your entire face
it doesn't cause me to peel
i look like i don't have any wrinkles when i put it on
it starts to work within a few days-i could deal with the redness not not the flakiness
it doesn't make my sensitive skin break out.
i might start applying it under my moisturizer so that it can sink directly into my skin
it doesn't break out my skin and i'm 24.
maybe i should scowl less
it really does work from the root of the wrinkle
doesn't make it look greasy
i really like how this moisturizer is not sticky when it dries
its unfortunate they don't put it in a pump because that means bacteria can build up
why keep trying to hide skin with more makeup
it's also oil free.
it got to the point where not even blotting powder
i will also do a disclaimer that i do use pore strips too to clean out my pores
does not leave it oily plus it does not feel heavy on my skin
i love this product simply for nourishing my skin without breaking me out
this moisturizer does everything i need it too.
the only thing is that the texture of this cream doesn't spread around my whole face easily
more importantly i don't get oily during hot days
i also wish they'd have put this into a pump bottle rather than a tub
i always feel bad having to stick my fingers directly into the cream adding all sorts of gross bacteria
which helps hydrate my skin or else i think the algenist would not be hydrating enough for me
doesn't ball up under makeup
this is the only moisturizer i can wear under make-up that does not increase oily skin issues
have a hard time finding a moisturizer that doesn't cause breakouts
no breakouts--it feels soothing--especially if i get a bit of a sunburn because i missed putting spf on a portion of my neck
you get a large amount for $65 it's so worth it for oily skin
doesn't make your skin feel oily
i didn't notice my pores getting smaller
i don't go a day without this lightweight
fresh scent that does not break me out
i really considered returning this because it does not leave your skin matte or absorb oil
it also doesn't leave my skin oily
when i try skin care
i do use a skin care line from sephora that is a bit pricey
it's like an oil slick
5 min after i apply my makeup i have to re-powder because it's already oily again
it's not kidding when it says "multi-perfecting".
it has transformed my face to where now i can wear no face makeup whatsoever except the occasional powder
my face looks as if i have makeup on
make sure you don't leave the product without the lid on
does not make me oily at all
most oil-free does not hydrate enough
my skin is not shiny during the day
it seems like it would be a great primer under my bare minerals
i don't think it smells bad at all
turned out to be a lot thicker than i expected a gel moisturizer to feel so can really only apply immediately post shower
doesn't seem to be causing breakouts
that doesn't happen with this moisturizer.
so almost anything gives me pimples
leaves me...not matte, but 'multiperfected'.
i am skeptic when it comes to anything that will "minimize" pores
i don't think it smells bad!
only reason i didn't give a 5 * is because it has no sunscreen
it's nice on your skin
i sometimes feel like i need to use another moisturizer after
perhaps it's just the skin tightening effects.
my foundation doesn't become greasy-looking when i use this moisturizer
it's light and not over bearing.
i normally can't wear a moisturizer during the day because i will have an oil slick within an hour
it wasn't miracle shrinkage
i don't have huge pores
as long as i don't get a nasty pimple like the craters i used to wake up w/while using products from the companies i've hereby mentioned
my skin wouldn't hesitate in letting me know in the form of an unsightly pimple
just succumb to the temptation of retin-a
big pores with congestion no matter what i use
my skin tone is even
i must mention though that i have oily skin
you cannot get all of the product out of the bottle
if other creams have helped it's a coincidence
it's also not greasy or gloppy
doesn't irritate my eyes
not greasy at all
i don't even use concealer anymore
it doesn't cure dark circles
buy does temporarily make them seem less puffy
it's light like a gel
this doesn't make them irritated
thick like an eye cream so don't expect that
maybe there is an allergic reaction to something in some
t really doesn't provide any moisture by itself
i love that you can use it on the actual eyelid
just because this is marketed as an eye cream does not mean you can't use this as an all over face serum
it didn't irritate my skin at all
this gel is not a miracle worker so don't expect surgery smooth under eyes
it is easy to wear
doesn't irritate my skin
found that even though i have aging skin the creams were too rich for day time use under makeup
stop giving wrinkle creams a one star because they don't work for you
as the retinol can cause flaking if your skin doesn't have time to adjust to it
doesn't irritate my sensitive skin in the least.
there are very few retinol products that you can use on your lids
doesn't irritate at all
not too laden with silicone
it's just a shame this isn't larger
you don't have to follow up with a moisturizer.
i only do if i'm going to wear concealer.
doesn't leave a greasy residue
you'll have to start slow
i too got crepey fine lines
no matter how much sleep i get or what moisturizer i use
it's always a lot of $$ for eye cream
lighten cream seems to be doing the trick
i did not have to apply as much under eye concealer when i used it
other than just plain coconut oil
i do lack sleep
don't waste your time.
this stuff gets rid of it
adding this eye cream to my beauty routine is the only thing i can attri
it hydrates your under eyes which in turn makes them look better
it is gentle on the eyes so you can rub it in a bit
i do not feel like a residual layer on my skin
only eye cream i believe makes a difference.
admittedly i do use a korres eye cream every three days or so
so maybe it's a magic combo?
it doesn't do much for wrinkles though.
it's definitely one of the 5 eye creams i have in stock at all times
flaky around my kids
not to mention stays smooth under my makeup application
don't really need to be using an eye cream
does not irritate my eyes or hurt if i accidentally get it into my eyes
i love it because it's heavy duty without being too hydrating
not too heavy moisturizer that doesn't aggravate my skin
the area around my eyes does not look dull
doesn't look oily at all
even if it doesn't brighten my eye area
a little too thick that it creases under my eyes even after i let it absorb
don't skip this step!
it doesn't really smell
this doesn't aggravate my eye
it does not clog any pores around my eyes
it does help lighten them
although this eye cream doesn't solve my ever-present dark circle problem
it's not a miracle in a jar
moisturises under my eyes like it's no body's business
my concealer goes on a lot nicer while using this
the only thing i would mention is the cream doesn't absorb super quickly
doesn't irritate my eyes at all
it's such a simple yet amazing concept
i think it's all causing me to get milia
it's probably safe to use during the day
just use it at night because it's very dewy
plus i really didn't like the oil stains that it left on my pillow sheets
my only qualm is that the temperatures in the summer keep the moisturizer in "oil" form rater than "cream" form
my vib rouge status isn't showing either
it did wonders to "cure" the effects of a bad cold
t is easy to apply without any tugging or effort at all
doesn't cause my acne prone
it's so so soothing
i couldn't seem to get rid of the harsh dryness which would cause the cycle to restart
yes this is made up of many oils
i only use it at night since my skin can get oily
it leaves my skin dewy and isn't too heavy.
keeps lips from splitting if you laugh or sneeze
lightweight in 1-2pumps the infinity will sink into ur skin for a natural or beneath any makeup perfect skin it doesn't stay greasy
it also doesn't smell "nutty" which i like a lot
i even apply it to my lips
don't have to use chapstick when out
it delivers the same results if nit better
i don't flake or peel anymore.
the only thing that doesn't make me break out is this lotion
it was too oily for my entire face
definitely recommend if you have any stubborn dry spots that don't seem to go away
because the lotion i was using wasn't strong enough
my beauty routine is pretty simple--wash face
it makes your face look so dewy
after letting it set in for about 10 minutes you couldn't tell that you had just looked like a basted turkey
so sometimes you may need to blot your palms after applying
it's even toned down my roscaea so there is barely any redness
it completely eliminates the red bumps along with any itchy-ness
because it's so light
it doesn't leave greasy marks
doesn't feel greasy at all
doesn't feel like its absorbing
i do not apply it on my lips bc the tangerine oil i feel somewhat irritates my sensitive lips
hydration wherever you need it whenever you need it
i will say it's not life changing for dry lips
my face doesn't need intense hydration
so you don't have that oily h
heels/ it's non-sticky
seriously love this stuff i'm super dry flaky
people think i get manicured often because of it.
sometimes on the kids.
feels good to use this instead of harsh prescription meds
its actually perfect for my tattoo as it heals
it's not a miracle cream
it's the consistency of aquaphor but thicker.
blemishes somehow clear up when you would think a cream like this would cause blemishes
it's really hard to find something that wont make me break out in pimples or a rash
i mix it with my blush for a different make-up look sometimes
i pat a tiny amount over my make-up if it's looking dry
it doesn't seem to sink in quickly
it's good that it stays on
i mix a little of this with my face cream
even though i wear make-up a guy doesn't wanna look too shiny
i love how it just melts into my skin
for as long as i can remember i have this strange texture skin underneath my eyes
even fillers to help this problem
use it with my foundations when my skin is a lil too dry because i didnt think of using it like that :
strong enough to moisturize yet light enough that it doesnt sit heavy on my skin
before this i would just use coconut oil
even though many reviews said this is great i was worried if it would be oily or sticky
it's a perfect travel size too
my skin still gets flakey by the end of a work shift
it has a nice citrus smell which doesn't linger.
i absolutely hated that it has these little microscopic granules
i know it's an oil
they tend to sit on the skin
i only use it at night because it hydrates my skin so much
i usually mix some of this into my night cream
i would like to preface by saying i have very oily skin
it often left my skin too slick to apply makeup
doesn't clog the drain
i need to wear something with spf
it only takes a dab though
it takes forever to rub in
it made my skin kinda dull
you just need a good cleanser and this cream.
i don't like spend much time on taking care of my skin cuz i'm busy with labs
most of time i have to use a lot of lamer cream to keep my skin not drying out
maybe it's due to the cold
which means you don't have lots of time to deal with your skin
it's not over powering
the cream really absorbs into your skin it doesn't just sit on the surface
the cream is not too think nor too watery
does not burn or tingle on application
fine lines seem to be fading
alone it gives your skin a healthy glow i can't say enough good things about it
not annoying or overpowering
of course it doesn't make wrinkles go away permenently
actually happened to find this cream in my moms drawer
this cream is light enough that my skin loves it
also uses it--he thinks he's sneaky about it
not at all greasy
it's one of the better eye creams i have used.
i do not recommend if you're using this for puffiness or dark circles
this is the only eye cream i've ever used that does not irritate the skin around my eyes
i've had issues with eye cream where it didn't feel like any cream on
i don't have lines around my eyes unless i smile
it's borderline greasy so you don't need a ton.
sometimes the under eye tissue is so crepey that if i rub my eyes the skin will stay that way
it didn't make my lids overly greasy overnight either
i don't usually wear under my makeup
i normally don't suffer from under eye bags
so cannot report if the cream actually reduces the look of fine lines
it doesn't mess up my eye makeup at all
it's not a groundbreaking formula so you'll have to use other products if you want more antioxidants
i cannot say enough about this wonderful nighttime moisturizer
i love that it's in a squeeze bottle
it takes some getting used to since it's a little sticky
doesn't leave your h
s or face feeling greasy like some other products
also doesn't leave residue on my pillow
i can wear makeup or not wear makeup
i stopped using the regular moisture surge because once using the gel it felt tacky
it's a nice tick layer of lotion
didn't feel greasy at all
don't let the term "mask" scare you
you do not have to rinse this off in the morning
i don't use it under makeup though
i love that it isn't quite as heavy as other night-time moisturizers
it actually absorbs into your skin before you go to sleep
i can still feel the moisture in my skin when i go to wash my face at night
i cannot go without a moisturizer ever.
you can wear it at night or under makeup
goes on the skin without feeling tacky
it's not oily which is good for my sensitive skin
it's not greasy and really soaked into the skin.
sometimes i even wear this in the morning
sometimes i use this as my night moisturizer
sometimes i use it over my regular moisturizer
nothing seemed to work- they either case me to break out or to have really oily/greasy face
it doesn't feel sticky or heavy
without anything heavy or greasy
however, it doesn't have a heavy feeling when on.
it doesn't wear off like other night moisturizers do
this doesn't make it any more oily
this doesn't irritate it at all
i would not recommend this for those with oily skin types because this product does nothing to help minimize the oil on your skin
my skin is prone to clogging too
this product does not clog pores
your make-up might get cakey if you don't give it enough time to absorb into the skin
i can break out sometimes
i especially like that it's oil free.
not worry about it wrecking my skin or clogging my pores
i couldn't get past the texture
i love that it directs you to massage it into your skin -- sometimes patting moisturizers on just doesn't feel h
it's essentially fragrance-free
doesn't smell like medicine eitherthickness-not very thick
i just use it when i think my skin needs extra hydration
you can feel the moisture on your skin all night long
can you use this around your eyes?
not something you massage into your skin
everyone knows when you blow your nose every other minute it gets flaky
it's pretty light and not oily.
can look oily when i use a product that's too heavy
i don't usually go for moisture surge anything for my face
because i feel it's too oily for anything
my skin doesn't need to produce extra natural oil at night hence no new surprise breakouts in the morning
although the description does not say it is for oily skin types
i would strongly suggest not using this if you are oily/combo oily
you just need a dab when you use it.
if you use the same amount you would for a regular face mask it feels really greasy
i hydrates the skin as it's supposed to do
it doesn't get sticky unless i put on a way too much
makes your face look greasy-
it's a mask for bedtime so who cares
now that my skin isn't dry anymore
i don't use it as a mask at all
it's a tad too greasy for my entire face
doesn't mess up my pillow
t does deliver on making your skin dewy
this mask is no joke.
would always wake up with flaky patches
it's so smooth going on
doesn't tighten my face all crazy
it also doesn't flake or break apart.
it's not thick by any means
that doesn't leave a long lasting oily feel
that sucks all the moisture from your skin as well
lol if you have dry skin i highly suggest you try this out
it's definitely a long lasting moisturizer unlike something you can get with glamglow thirsty mud
it's made my skin feel much more moisturizer
i usually know by the next day if something will cause any breakouts since i have acne prone skin
the mask didn't irritate it at all
it's gentle enough to use every few days
effective enough that you'll feel
it tingles a bit when you apply it
not in an irritating way- it is refreshing
you do notice less blackheads
it definitely doesn't strip my skin
once it's on for a little while the burn stops.
it doesn't seem too expensive
masks tend to get icky
im so surprised that it can clean out the blackheads on my nose
it took care of the pimples very quick
i do like the mask.
nothing too perfume like or chemical
not to mention my skin feels deep cleaned
it doesn't dry hard or get flakey
ing is that this masque shouldn't really be left to dry on your skin
provided you have a nice thick layer of the product on you will see it start to ‘pull’ something from your pores
the mask itself feels like it's warming up with you put it on
the only negative thing about thisproduct is that it does look like you have mud or poo all over your face
you just have to refridgerate it in a ziplock
whatever your skin type is
this mask is no joke!
every mask i have tried either makes my face super dry or irritated
do not rip yourself off by using one pod 2-3 times
works well to brighten my sensitive skin without any scary itching/tingling
you get a lot in the pods
after using the one pod of glamglow i decide to switch to something else for the cleansing musk
acne scars seem to fade away a little
it's not too drying on the skin.
the cool is a little off putting once it's on
you can get three masks out of each little tub
your actually wasting your money cause your drying out the clay
your face won't get all that goodies that the mask can provide cause your cutting your self short
there's so much product in these pots you can easily get 2 facials from each one
being wishy washy dont be
the mask does not irritate my face
doesn't take every washcloth in the house to remove
as i have the "if there's no tingle
my skin typically feels ridiculously soft after rinsing this wonderful potion away
enough to do spot treatments with just one cup
it didn't irritate or cause breakouts
ie i am not blackhead free
after i used this i can easily clean up all those dirty things
i honestly bought this product mostly because of the brush
it`s easy to apply with no mess
it's cold when you put it on
it doesn't leave a residue which i've noticed with other products
i wouldn't rely on this to clear up blemishes for you
in the end it will definitely help your clogged pores
it seemed more like a foundation because it blended with my skin tone lol
when you put it on your blemishes it causes no pains or burns
it even smells good unlike some other mud masks.
i love trying out new ones to help with controlling my oily
it doesn't even feel like a typical mud masque
i just love the little brush that comes with it too
doesn't really make your face sticky
does not clog my pores
it also doesn't burn my eyes like the boscia night moisturizer did
i could tell it was smoothing out my wrinkles too
this is one of the only things that works without leaving an oily residue
it doesn't cause acne
the pump on it means plenty is left in the tube that won't pump out when it's almost done
if you don't have very dry skin this probably isn't for you
it's not greasy at all
people state they felt like it doesn't absorb into the skin
it doesn't seem to absorb into the skin
t doesn't have any skin tightening properties
everyone's skin is different
love that it's non greasy
love that it's non irritating
i can only imagine my face looking super greasy
it's a little sticky at first
this one doesn't made me feel oily at all instead gave me enough hydration
since my combination skin doesn't h
too bad it doesn't really quench my skin's thirst
i am still trying to find that hg of non-greasy yet
a big bonus is that it hasn't broken our my acne prone skin
f any of you know anything about accutane then you know how severely dry it makes skin
this product keeps me from even feeling like i'm on accutane
absorbs fast doesn't smell too bad
smells a hint like the old coppertone to me which isn't too bad
-it didn't leave my skin feeling sticky or irritated
didn't leave my face looking greasy or oily
this is the first product that has not left my face feeling oily
i actually don't wear moisturizer at night.
even though i used the word greasy
i also love that there aren't a bunch of nasty chemicals in it
would recommend anyone with combo or dry skin to try it for a week or 2
doesn't clog your pores
i almost cannot stop touching my skin because of how soft it is now
doesn't leave gunk on my pillow :
it's also not a bad price for a "fancy" sephora br
i love that it doesn't get greasy or "slick" like some night creams
i just cannot get enough of this moisturizer.
one pet peeve of mine is when night moisturizers make my skin feel like it's sweating under it
wish the spf rating was higher since i am getting the same feeling of a light residue/film on my skin that a regular sunscreen has anyway
i've seen many people say that it leaves their skin looking shiny
not at all greasy
it didn't make my face shiny at all
i happen to be combo oily in the summer
i like how this isn't ridiculously greasy.
it doesn't make my skin super shiny like a lot of other moisturizers with spf does
so lets talk about that down side.. the smell!
i guess i gotta experiment with some perfumes to cover it up
not bad for summer because its not sticky or heavy
i don't feel any pilling if i put on primer right after
yet not greasy to the touch
i don't feel oily at all when i wear this.
all tho it does have that no smell kind of smell from the ingredients
it's always hard to wear any type of sunscreen on my face without breaking out
matte that i haven't had a problem with it
the smell of typical sunscreen has always made me sick so this stuff wins in that area as well
the spf can make you especially oily looking around the t zone
it's nothing a bit of powder can't fix
doesn't leave it gross
i keep going back to this because most other sunscreens are chalky
leave weird residue on your face
i can't think of a time when i've gotten burned with it on during everyday activities
i do switch to the sticky spf 55+ stuff
i like that it doesn't have harsh ingredients
this product is soothing rather than irritating
this is the only spf moisturizer i've tried that doesn't irritate my skin
it would feel tacky by the end of the work day
t would be a good idea to reapply if you're out in the sun often
it's really hard to find an spf that isn't thick
it's not an overpowering smell
doesn't clog my pores
light, not greasy, doesn't make your skin white.
doesn't smell weird or anything.
i don't seem to be allergic to this
the product isn't tacky or sticky
of course that it doesn't cause breakouts
doesn't leave your face feeling like u just put sunscreen
so having a lightweight moisturizer that doesn't my clog my pores
this product doesn't cause breakouts,
although it's a little oily
i love that it's non-greasy
it doesn't over-moisturize my t-zone
do you know how hard it is to get a non-greasy spf 30?
isn't an spf smell rather slightly plastic-y
doesn't irritate my skin
this doesn't give me breakouts
doesn't irritate my skin
it doesn't have the nasty spf feel
i usually hate using moisturizer during the day because it tends to leave me greasy
it wasn't too thick like a lot of products with spf
does not leave a greasy film
i don't consider this a negative trait because it means you only need a little to cover your whole face
the container is annoying
it doesn't leave a greasy residue.
there is little to no fragrance since they don't add anything artificial
it is not oil free but it does not feel greasy.
it doesn't make my skin oily or feel greasy.
you will still like this because it's florally
make my face look greasy
it does everything it's supposed to do without making my skin feel oily
many products make me feel like i'm putting on a full layer of sunscreen as though i'm going to the beach
i can't feel it once it's on
it doesn't affect my makeup at all
it doesn't make me look greasy
which is what usually happens with products with spf in them
it has a tendency to sit on my face
it doesn't have a heavy scent
if you've been hesitant about using other 30 spf's due to that heavy greasy feeling
goes on clearly without any of that white diaper cream look
it doesn't sting when i put it on
doesn't clog the pores
it's not "heavy", and goes on easily!
it's also very easy to toss into your beach bag
it doesn't wear heavy at all
doesn't leave me greasy
it's so lightweight for spf 30.
i don't know if it's fragrance-free
doesn't make me feel greasy
don't even wake up oily
i think it moisturises, but it's hard to tell.
it's strange to both like a product
otherwise, your pillow will get all the benefits!
without making me look greasy
the oily t zone does not get too oily.
does not clog pores
anything that may be oil clogging
t doesn't feel like you're layering on product
love that they have a moisturizer that's oil free
doesn't irritate my skin
am not greasy from using this
it's the only thing that makes my skin smooth
not making it too oily
i don't get any breakouts from this
or get something with spf instead
so for me any oil will make my t-zone more oily
my skin legit drinks this stuff.
if you want a moisturizer that mattifies i wouldn't necessarily suggest this :my skin either looks balanced or glowy
it'll moisturize the heck out of your skin without leaving an oily/greasy film on it
doesn't cause or make hormonal breakouts worse
my skin looks better on it's own
works for every kind of skins
it's hard for me to find a moisturizer that doesn't make my skin feel greasy or breakout
my boyfriend says my face looks like an oil slick
otherwise they are too sticky
does not feel heavy on my skin
i know it's pricey
not only has my skin become more luminous i've notice i'm not as oily
it's hard to find a night cream that doesn't have a sticky finish
doesn't react well to heavy creams
doesn't feel sticky or heavy on the skin
my skin is combo and this does not make it oily.
if my skin feels uncomfortable i pop this on
s thick so you don't need a lot to cover your face
sometimes flaky skin-- i mean
lotions which have hardly done the job
or just as anytime treat for your skin
i will never be without this lovely mask which i don't actually use as a mask
i don't use it as a mask
i know it's a mask
i can't imagine someone with oily skin using this product
some moisturizers can turn me into a greaseball
doesn't break out those with oily skin
some people say this product breaks them out because it is on the thick side
no joke... another nars must haves!!
it does not irritate my skin
i don't find it greasy and it absorbs well.
both seemed like they were too oily for me
i don't feel the oil on my skin
i don't have flaky
or splotchy spots on my face anymore since i started using this
not greasy at all
this really sinks into your skin
doesn't leave me greasy looking
definitely easy to overuse so only three drops max
this doesn't leave a film or gunk up my pores at all
the smell doesn't linger at all
doesn't leave my face oily even with being an oil
it does not block your pores or any thing.
after noticing how flakey my foundation ends up in my t-zone
i guess it really wasn't penetrating into my skin to lock down the moisture
it's helped restore that moisture i desperately needed in my t-zone
the price isn't bad for the amount of product you get
i mix a little bit of this with whatever moisturizer i'm using
this facial beauty oil didn't make it any worse
hardly has any scent
i think any kind of facial oil does a great job of keeping oil at bay
it doesn't have a scent
i also don't have super oily areas to my t-zone anymore
it is more of a glow oily all over rather than just super shiny in my t-zone
it hydrates my face without feeling like i have heavy product on my face
recommend washing your pillows at least every 3 days to make sure that you rest your face on a clean surface every night if you really want great results
i don't feel extra-oily
does not leave a shiny film
i don't use this everyday
which causes my skin to look quite dull
luckily it doesn't clog my pores which i love
go easy on it or you will end up with breakouts.
around my nose that have been impossible to treat
it is not greasy
i cannot say enough good things about this facial oil
can't let this expensive bottle go to waste
it doesn't make you greasy at all!!
it doesn't make your skin feel oily at all
pretty sure it's fragrance free.
doesn't leave you all shinny
it is never greasy or feels heavy on my skin.
i love this oil it's not as heavy which i like
it's really nice for my oily skin i only use use it at night time
i can't tell if it's good with anti-aging or not since i don't have visibly signs of aging
its not heavy or greasy feeling like a lot of oils can feel
always read the labels to make sure you are not allergic to any of the ingredients
this provides just the hydration i need without leaving a bunch of product residue
the dropper makes it easy to use just the right amount
doesn't look oily on
i still have a hard time smearing oil on my face
you only need 3-4 drops
then your skin just feels plump
then it is not greasy
and no it does not make my skin extra oily.
i don't rub it in just pat
if you like to use face oil.
i do find that there is a bit of tightening felt once it's absorbed
love the way it treats my face
not too thick to use with my clarisonic
has not overdried my skin like most cleansers do.
too bad it's so pricy
it's really helped balance my oily skin
seriously, it feels so lux when it foams up.
if you are trying to find a foaming cleanser that removes all make up
the tiniest amount goes a long way to lather
not just cleaning it
it's has a great lather.
still hasn't lost it's appeal.
i can't stand cleansers that don't lather.
i wear quite a heavy face of makeup each day
don't get it in your eyes
does not seem to be over-fragranced
nothing got me excited until origins plantscriptions anti-aging cleanser
it is not greasy at all
it foams up enough for your whole face
there's little to no smell to this product
it does sting if gotten into your poor eye
it does leave that "squeaky clean" feeling
doesn't feel heavy, but makes skin feel firm.
i don't use it under makeup
whenever i dont wear any makeup
it doesn't make me oily either
it's not too heavy
doesn't mess with my makeup
it really gives your face that 24 hour moisture that it promises
and also, it wasn't greasy and heavy.
when it doesn't control oil
i like to use it alone underneath my makeup on very humid days because it absorbs so easily
doesn't feel greasy or sticky on my normal skin
it's the same smell a lot of other fresh products have
if you want a light weight moisturizer that doesn't leave your skin oily this is for you
it's a mild rose scent that only lingers if someone's inches from your face
i think there may be a cucumber scent as well
my face didn't look red
usually i get tired of products quickly :
first of all, i think gel "cream" is a misnomer.
it seems a bit sticky right after application
i hate all moisturizers that are too heavy
this moisturizer doesn't make me break out
it's not greasy at all
in my opinion it isn't too overpowering
the only downside is that this doesn't contain any spf
it doesn't leave a residue
i usually don't even need a full pump
i like the light smell too.
except you don't need a moisturizer after it
unlike other reviews i didn't react nor was my face oily
if i don't use i i have cystic acne pretty bad
in a flaky gross kind of way that cannot be covered by makeup
it didn't overdo it
i don't mind the smell at all
it feels like you are treating your skin to holy water
feels like the ingredients were literally made for your skin
it's not greasy at all
i don't notice a smell at all.
on days i don't wear makeup i can sometimes smell the lotion even a couple hours later
i imagine it's good for daytime
i think it's better for nighttime
not oily after whole night sleep
there's no greasy feel afterwards
only complaint is it leaves me a little shiny.
probably not for oily skin?
do not use it for a summer morning otherwise it will make your face oily for the day
what i like about it is the scent.
it doesn't feel greasy.
doesn't leave your skin greasy which allows my makeup to last longer throughout the day
while it may feel slightly tacky
which sometimes tends to happen
it is not heavy or greasy feeling
it's true that the gel is a little bit sticky
it isn't as red
a lot of people are complaining about how this cleanser doesn't remove makeup--
unlike other foaming cleanser it doesn't strip my skin at all
foam cleansers usually don't do it for me
i don't use it to remove my eye makeup
don't do well with using things with harsh chemicals at all
i cannot wear it around my boyfriend because he complains about the "tea" smell all night
i don't even need to use a lot of moisturizer.
it doesn't irritate my dry sensitive skin which is a super plus for me
doesn't make my skin feel dry at all
just a few zits here
try it and you'll see!
even though it is a foam
this cleanser doesn't leave your skin feeling tight at all afterward
it does make your face look orange when you apply that why i'm using it as a night cream
hey it's about working well not being injected with perfumes
the smell doesn't bother me
it scares a little bit with it's orange color so be careful with clothes
i might have to warn you about the orange tint it gives your face when applying the product
the full bottle really smells like old weed
i can't live without this oil in my nightly routine
for those complaining about this scent
it doesn't disappear completely overnight
the product does not clog my pores
but it's also over $300!
some people say it can be oily
i usually use boscia's tsubaki oil.
for the people who say its too greasy or doesn't absorb
doesn't break out my acne-prone skin
if you're applying under makeup it gets blended with you next layer anyway
i lfeel it takes a while to absorb so you can't layer another product like sunscreen on right after
i wear this oil under my foundation sometimes
i don't care what your skin type is
it does wear off
my face doesn't smell when i put makeup on top
my skin looks so dull
i can't stop touching it.
doesn't make my combination skin oily
if you rub/pat it in
just the all over texture of my skin
if you use a moisturizer after it then it will take the orange tint this oil gives you away
this bad smell people are complaining about
i do not get that at all to me it smells like rose hip oil
if you do have a problem with the smell wear it to bed :
it will obviously wear off to the pillow if you immediately put your orange oily face on it so just use common sense
does not leave an orange cast
they're not turning into a cyst at least
seriously with use i could see a difference in my skins texture
i don't notice a smell
even if it smelled sketchy i would use it
no fishy smell what so ever!
no fishy smell, doesn't smell like much.
love the smell color does not bother me or transfers to pillow soaks right in
but i use before i go to sleep so it's ok
sometimes it does sneak through
your face is so "glowy"
this oil has gotten completely rid of my scars
doesn't give me the glow that oh oil does
oh oil is pure rose hip oil mixed with a couple other oils that help to mask the smell
it's not so heavy that you end up looking greasy if you want to seal it in with a moisturizer too
i just wear it under my nighttime moisturizer so that i don't have to go out in public smelling like this
can't speak to how it might feel on an oilier skin type since it is pretty greasy to put on
doesn't get as oily during the day
you really don't want it on your pillowcase
oils don't live up to their hype
because i don't want to have oily skin during the day
loves the citrus clean smell as i do too
the one thing i do not like about this is that it takes a while before it soaks into your skin
so i seldom use concealer on my eye areas.
i don't feel like it is too heavy
it's also the only eye cream that does not irritate my eyes
this bio-performance was still too slippery to wear under makeup for me
not heavy feeling like other br
hydration of my entire face -- yes
various pricey la prairie eye creams i tried aren't as good as this eye cream either
not too thick to where you can't apply make up over it
i usually apply it all over my eyes
not greasy at all
it's my new go to eye cream.
this eye cream does everything it claims.
it's the first eye cream/serum i have found in years that doesn't make my eyes watery
not overbearing like some that i've used in the past
this cream doesn't irritate them at all
it's tough to find a cream that clams to work on that problem
i don't have dark circles
not thick easy to apply
i still can use this eye cream
add to your"beauty dollars that didn't work" pile
i love what it does for oily/combo skin in hot
i don't notice any color difference after using it for 3 mornings
to fix that i usually mix 1/2 of this product with 1/2 of my regular face moisturizer
i don't use this in the fall/winter when i don't want to appear tan
it's made such a difference
no one has any idea that it's from self-tanner
i couldn't get past the scent
it's very hard to find a good self tanner for your face when you have such oily skin like i have
i didn't see any true tanning effect
the smell isnt that bad either
the packet did not say that it helped you tan
i do not like tanning and woke up super streaky.
thankfully the color didn't stay
since the glowlotion doesn't have spf
love the smell too
my skin tone is mre even
only complaint is that it smells a bit odd.
you can use it on your eyes
i don't see any difference in dark spots
i guess the potency evaporates or something
my skin is like a joke
the juvederm just didn't perk my face up like usual
it doesn't feel heavy on my skin
it's not overly greasy like some moisturizers.
it doesn't feel oily anymore at all
it provides so much moisture that my makeup doesn't crease at all
sometimes i have bad reactions to certain creams
it doesn't feel oily like some product can do.
especially after obsessing over it's eye cream counterpart
doesn't make it look or feel oily
the only downfall about tho moisturizer is it does not pair well with some of my primer
nothing miscellar water couldn't fix
it doesn't leave your face feeling too greasy
i think i would stick with a thicker formula
doesn't make my skin feel oily after
it doesn't dry down in that weird tacky way that a lot of gels do
i actually find that i don't need to add any oils to this moisturizer to get it to leave my skin looking glowy as i have to do with some of my other moisturizers
it's not as heavy as cream
it's not sticky like a lot of other moisturizer
the fact that it's a gel makes it so lightweight
i like how it just disappears on my skin
doesn't make it oily or anything
i am so happy that it doesn't make my skin oily after a while
doesn't make my face greasy
i don't typically wear any moisturizer because i am prone to getting pimples here
there if i have anything heavy on my skin
don't get greasy under my makeup
doesn't leave your skin greasy
i usually don't like trying out new moisturizers
it doesn't leave a weird film or any stickiness.
doesn't make skin overly oily which is nice.
this is lightweight and didn't break me out.
i also like that this doesn't contain sunscreen so that i can apply it both day
my t zone was not greasy or shiny
i loved that it didn't feel heavy or suffocating like a lot of moisturizers can do
i don't even wear highlighter
it's got light weight feel
it is not greasy
strong so beware if you do not like scented products
just enough without the heaviness of some other moisturizers
i usually don't go for moisturizers labeled as a gel or lightweight cause my skin tends to feel dry after using it still
don't take me wrong it dries fast
because it's labeled as a "gel"
it's texture is just that
it barely looks likes i have used any in the jar
it also doesn’t make the skin get that tacky feel i sometimes notice with other br
it has a citrus smell to it that will make you want to keep sniffing it all the time
i wouldn't wear this all day or under makeup
i can't describe the smell
so don't go scooping a big dollop
because it's gel-based
t doesn't make my skin any more oily than it already is
i did enjoy how it glides on my skin
does not leave it with sweaty or oil
it is not thick does not feel in the face
doesn't make my face oily or slick
not only is the smell refreshing in the morning
since it doesn't have spf
but not too overpowering for your senses.
this product does not irritate my skin
definitely recommend this for anyone with oily skin in the summer
i absolutely like that this is not very sticky or bulky underneath my makeup
doesn't make my skin feel sticky or greasy in any way
give my honest opinion let's start with the smells it smells so amazing i want to eat it i have oily skin
i get this refreshing water feeling that i can't quite describe
what bothers me it's that it can take a while to dry off
it has that greasy sensation until it does
it's my morning go to product.
so appreciate that it doesn't feel heavy on my face or leave me super greasy midday
it's so light weight and smells amazing!
not so heavy that it feels greasy
it's supposed to brighten and refresh the skin.
sometimes products that do that tend to make me face oily
i never thought i'd find the day that a primer would work for my oily skin
made me sweat like my face could not breathe
not just disguised skin issues
gotta fill in those fine lines
sometimes i only wear this just for those no makeup days
the only reason it doesn't get 5 stars in my books is i prefer something less mattifying as i like a dewy look
plus it's anti-aging.
not greasy like some other primers
dont really need anti-aging
i like this primer over smashbox
i really notice a difference when applying blush.
sometimes i notice some feeling sticky
not the genius cream
my skin is truly combination with an oily t-zone
this miracle primer provides an even base for my foundation so you can barely notice the hills
i don't need to use cc cream underneath foundation anymore
considering that it's a skin care item as well
not only does it take away the sticky feeling
not-so-much-chance for retouching the makeup
plus it's anti-aging!
don't have any wrinkles
it's made my skin look
make sure it is completely dry before you apply your foundation
not only does this primer work it helps to decrease the size of yours pores while your wearing it
no pilling no shine it is just smooth
my pores a little less annoying
this primer never beads up like some
it doesn't make my face look flaky as others
though it's without silicone
you have that instantly smooth feel you have to wait for like on the non-silicone smashbox photo finish or sephora silicone-free/oil-free primer
it's good to know i can wear a full face of makeup through the day
they tell me they are supposed to make your pores look smaller
my makeup doesn't come off unless i wash it off
it doesn't really make your pores look smaller
it does make your makeup glide on your face
seems like a high price to pay though for something that doesn't really minimize pore appearance
if you need color correction then this isn't the primer for you or you'll need to add one
normally i would only expect this feeling with a good serum
don't expect it to take care of every imaginable problem
it is light not greasy
and it was basically just silicone.
i find most primers have an oily feel to them after applying
usually don't overdo it
then lancome -- big fat difference
it's a little bit greasy at first
it's helping the lines around my cheeks
it's non irritating and makes my skin look great.
not at all sticky
it doesn't make my oily
it doesn't irritate my skin like most retinol products do
sometimes i put a moisturizer over it
occasionally i skip that
anyways, my acne has mostly (as in 98%!!)
it's a very good non-irritating retinol product that i intend to continue to use
this is amazing for combo skin that doesn't want any of the slick
yay, doesn't irriate skin or make me itch.
since i am in my 20s i don't need to overdo it
my dermatologist recommended i get a retin product to help control my grease face as well as help to reduce these super annoying tiny bumps that never go away
it was so good at re-moisturizing perhaps that whatever peeling occurred didn't really matter at the end of the day
i actually just use this + eye cream under my makeup
you can't put the excess back!
it might seem petty
i find it does not make my face oily at all
it gets rid of the dullness for me.
there's definition in my cheeks
had trouble finding one that didn't cause my finicky
love the cleanser, too.
gives just the right amount of moisture without making my skin greasy
mild, yet after using cheeks have a nice flush.
you'll see it only in a couple days
does not feel like i have a thick film on my face
i didn't feel it moisturizes at all
i am getting to the point where i no longer have to "spackle" on my makeup
i won't even need concealer if this continues
this product works well because i don't have any peeling
don't wear retinol during the day- if you know this
i do get occasional breakouts
they aren't as bag
i can still tell a difference in the firmness of my skin
it's my daily routine
there is just something about this sleeping facial that i cannot get over
not greasy at all.
let's face it, at 50 i have neck issues.
this one doesn't bother my sensitive skin at all
this serum is the only one i have ever tried that did not irritate or cause breakouts for my combination to dry skin
couldn't get rid of it
for those complaining that it did nothing for fine lines/wrinkles
if you don't get blemishes
the reason i look to see how quickly it absorbs because on really hot days when i apply my moisturizer
my face gets a little greasy if it doesn't absorb all the way into my skin first
i don't use it every night just on certain days when my skin visibly looks tired or dull
not only does this cream feel so luxurious
guess if you don't like the smell of greek yogurt then you won't like this
did not cause any clogged pores
actually it seems to balance out my skins oil
because they're too sticky
it's just the best of it's kind
it's tolerable when all it's other attri
while fragrances don't normal bother me
which makes sense because it's in it's name
t isn't acne prone like it used to be
the way it makes my skin feel- i slather this on at night
i will veer off if they don't fix the formulation
if i use a tiny amount of this mask i wake up to soft supple skin which lasts for days before i feel the need to apply more
i didn't get that burning sensation a lot of face products give me
doesn't leave a greasy heavy feeling like some creams do
i wouldn't say it's overpowering
it doesn't clog them or cause me to break out
you may feel greasy
it's a bit expensive but it's the best.
it does not make me more oily
i always worry about thick creams on my face at night because i break out easily
this stuff is the reason i didn't shrivel up like a raisin this past winter
doesn't feel heavy under nighttime lotion.
my face is back to being naturally oily--which i don't mind because i love the dewy look
it doesn't make my skin oily.
it is so soft that sometimes i forget how bad it used to be
i don't use it everyday
i am obsessed with this sleeping facial forget all night this stuff seems to work as soon as it's on my face
the only thing i don't care for is that the smell is a little perfumey other than that love love love how it feels
i just might try the regular moisturizer in this line it has no spf
it's not as rich as other br
not too heavy not to sticky
i still get occasional breakouts
i do struggle with the smell
it's not at all thick.
the smell fades and is not too intense.
it's so strong that it makes my eyes water
you don't get much in the jar
a very mild, soap like smell, if anything.
oh- does not erase lines
i usually wake up every morning with a really oily face
i don't think it's too much for my normal/oily combination skin
my skin feels like velvet as soon as i use it.
it is not as oily in the t-zone area
the 2 drops is enough
it's made my skin less oily, and much more glowy.
it doesn't erradicate them
i heard about this somewhere that this would be good for oily skin
it might get too oily for you
it's not really drying
did not gave me breakouts or made my skin oilier
it doesn't make me oily
being a vib rouge member you can imagine i've tried everything for oily skin around
it's lightweight and does not clog your pores.
it's still oily by many st
i don't find it unpleasant
though it's fine to use in the day
doesn't cause me to break out since i have really sensitive skin
don't try using it under makeup in the daytime
using the wrong product will clog my pores
it's not the most flattering look since it appears so oily
i couldn't leave without foundation cause of my bad skin
it is not greasy
i didn't want anything too "oily"
i usually have at least 2-3 pimples on my face at a time
my skin tone is just not cute without makeup because i usually have a lot of little red dots on my face that are like mini acne i guess
not only does this clear clogged pores
it actually keeps my zits away
i great out almost immediately even if they are suited for oily acne prone skin
i know it is scary the thought of putting oil on oily skin
why didn't i know about this product when i was a teenager?i have super oily skin with huge pores
this product did not make my pores disappear
it is a must have for anyone who is oily
i read the allure article about how oil can benefit acne-prone skin
i don't even need moisturizer in summer at night
you don't have to worry about smelling like a salad as it quickly fades
she swears it's because of this cream
doesn't leave any residue
it's not greasy on your face
it's hard to find a products that does provided adequate moisture with out break outs
definitely too heavy for me for daytime
it does not coat your skin
it's indeed non-tacky
there's no sticky feel.
doesn't clog your poor
i like this because it doesn't give me milia like most moisturizers do
i would say i'm neither stingy with it nor do i lather my whole body in it
i don't notice a strong smell- that could be a batch-based issue since it's made with algae- the only problem is that i find it sticky so makeup doesn't smooth well on top
i definitely would not recommend using this as a moisturizer under makeup
i rarely wear anything over my moisturizer
it doesn't cause any clogged pores or breakouts.
not too irritating on the eyes
doesn't leave my combination skin feeling greasy or oily
the packing is pretty gender neutral for those guys that don't like feminine looking packaging
it is not tacky on me
see how this could be true if you were oily or combination
not overpowering at all
its perfect under makeup with spf protection too so you cant go wrong
how this feels when it's on the skin
yes it does leave a shin on the skin
i don't see why people think this is "tacky" because for me it's lightweight
maybe it's for dryer skin types?
it doesn't leave a white film
my skin is not tight enough
i cannot even imagine the disaster it would do for even normal or combo skin types
i know it's pricey
my makeup goes on over it like a charm.
doesn't have the "perricone smell" either.
i did not notice any chalky whiteness as mentioned in other reviews
i would always run into issues with spf products burning or irritating my skin
love the spf too
doesn't irritate my skin (i have rosacea).
it's a great way to get daily spf on my face.
love how non-greasy it is.
overall, it's not a bad product.
i didn't have that heavy sunscreen feeling like some products do
normally i can go with just a tinted moisturizer
it stayed sticky all day even though the description says non-tacky
i am often able to go without makeup/foundation/bb cream
it doesn't clog my pores
don't use too much of it cause it can make you look pasty white
i don't like to use makeup with spf because i don't need it at night
when i put it on it doesn't take long for my skin to soak it up
you notice it's different from other moisturizers
my face doesn't become oily at day's end when i use this
absolutely light weight without any chalky feel like some sunscreens leave when trying not to be too oily
when you do, it feels sticky on your skin.
it doesn't make my super picky skin break out either
even if i don't wash my face at night
does not break it out or make it oily during the day
usually when i wear makeup it become flakey by the end of the day
even though this product is a cream
seems a little thick it does not feel that way when you apply it
or make me itch
when sunscreen is added to the equation my skin can really go berserk
i can barely smell the spf
it does leave a dewey feeling
it is not tacky like some reviews mention
you only have to apply a little of the product to have just enough of a radiance
if you overdue it of course your skin will look oily
i've noticed that i do get oily when i use this product
i don't want to have to blot my face every hour
even though it makes me oily
when i used this i didn't even have to use my normal moisturizer with it
t's not irritating at all
if you dislike the smell
it doesn't make my skin oilier
i don't have much of an oil shine at all
you'll end up saving money too
otherwise i'd give it 5 stars.
i don't feel the need to follow with a moisturizer
i don't use the whole dropper
doesn't have an overbearing odor
i just want to bathe in it!
words really can't describe what magic this liquid potion does
this stuff is seriously my holy grail product i've tried samples before
the product it's a bit pricey
t doesn't sit on top of my skin
while it did take care of my face--i just need the pill to control hormonal breakouts now--my pores are still large
it's not a moisturizer though
can't tell if that was from the serum or from the change of season
only reason i won't give it 5 stars is because for oily skin this will increase the shine the skin accumulates during the day
hence i think the description should not state 'fit for oily skin'
it's not oily whatsoever
you get an eye cream
do try to do some sort of anti aging mask/treatment twice a month or so
it's now a permanent part of my skin care routine
it got rid of the subtle
this stuff got rid of the blemishes
it's one of my favorite parts of my routine- i feel like i'm pampering myself when i put it on before moisturizer
you can instantly feel your face smoothen out like a baby
it's the best thing i've used so far to get rid of fine wrinkles
you don't even need a full dropper for your whole face
it says you'll see results in 7 days
i would definitely recommend this product for oily skin as this does not make your skin sensitive
because it can clog the occasional pore
it has gotten rid of some of the texture
normal skin when it's bare.
i tried other serums in between bottles because it's so expensive
makeup wasn't the same
not greasy at all- so smooth is goes on like water
my skin is not too dry or oily anymore.
it is not greasy and goes on clear.
feels like you haven't applied any cream
you only need a little on lids and undereye.
doesn't leave them flaky
if you're more oily you can just use this on the high points of your face like the cheekbones
i even put it on a bug bite
doesn't sit on top of skin or feel greasy
it's not my favourite way to put an oil on my face
you only smell it until the product is absorbed i find
the fragrance does not bother me because i know that it is not artifical
i didn't like that it was a rollerball applicator
don't recommend using it under makeup
this rollerball packaging is pretty bad because it doesn't allow any product to come out
if i could buy a perfume that smells like this
there are a few things i would improve- packaging: i do not like the idea of roller ball applicator
i do not like the idea of using this application method after you just applied lotion to your face
sometimes i put it under my moisturizer
yes, this oil is good for my oily skin.
sometimes that can backfire
doesn't leave my skin greasy at all
you don't waste any product
the name is apt: it really does seem to replenish the skin
my color is even
not only did her sunburn seem to evaporate in record time
free of any chemical nasties that cause me to stress over what they may be doing to my body
doesn't break me out or clog my skin
and it does not aggravate my skin.
it is not too heavy to wear under make up
i generally prefer masks i can use in the shower so rinsing is super easy
it's really gentle on acne prone skin too.
i do do have some acne scars
stripping your skin of it's natural oils with a mask isn't going to help
you'll love the texture of your skin
it doesn't smell bad
they'd provide some sort of spatula to make the use easier
i even like the way it smells
my skin does look
i don't know if it actually has smoothed my skin
am very glad that it's not perfumed
it's real plant smells
this doesn't irritate it
after you wash it off you can already tell a difference in your skin
i love that it's natural too.
the only thing it doesn't do for me is minimize pores
a thin layer of this mask is all you'll need.
there's a lot of gray area when it comes to effectiveness
topical treatments that still didn't completely do the trick
it's great as a spot treatment for any problem areas
the kind of skin that doesn't really need makeup.
the kind of skin that
this mask is all you need
to me it's like a natural
i hated the scent although it wasn't too strong or overbearing
it wasn't acne or rosacea but wouldn't go away.
i know it says put it on thick
i don't mind masks that recommend longer wait time to rinse off
i don't think i can sleep in it
even though i like treating my skin with masks
i didn't even have to use concealer on what are normally terrible hereditary dark circles under my eyes
it seemed to absorb the white stuff
it feels a little weird when it's dried on your face
it's easy to rinse off
i never use masks
admittedly, i'm kind of a mask fiend.
they're usually pretty lackluster in results
it makes me skin look so glowy
it does not irritate my skin or cause any breakouts
i like that it's gentle as well.
it is not irritating at all
it doesn't make my skin feel oily makeup looks great with it
by itself it doesn't cover enough or glide well.
i may try the cleanser, too!
you only need one squirt of it
doe not leave my face glossy like other oils do
guess they like chemical smells.
great moisturizer doesn't have that petroleum based feel
sometimes my face feels a little itchy after application
have found that hydration actually gets rid of my breakouts
for the simple reason that this cleanser has grains of stuff in it
my skin will react to any other cleanser that isn't as "clean" as tata harpers
i don't have that tight
i don't care for the smell
have to unscrew it every time i want to use it
so irritating for this price point.
also kind on your skin
wont make your skin feel dry
which i suspect because i do not wash my face clean enough
this cleanser doesn't irritate at all
any exfoliatior shouldn't be scrubbed hard on the skin
don't scrub, simply massage into the skin.
in order to get enough cleanser for my face
it does not leave my skin feeling stripped or squeaky clean
often just odd skin i have tried almost anything to even my complexion
i find that i have to use another cleanser for the eye area which is a little annoying
this product rinses much 'cleaner' if you use it in this way
it's taken away some redness around my t-zone too
forget about the surface
i find it gentle enough to use morning
maybe not all of my mascara
it's waaay too abrasive for that
there's some weird convenience
this is the only cleanser that doesn't leave my face feeling tight
this cleanser is so good it doesn't make my skin dry afterwards or strip it either
i don't get irritation or anything
i also love that fact it's natural ingredients
you can't use this cleanser with any tool
if you don't use it too often it's great
it's not super rough on the skin either
sometimes it won't pump out at all which is odd
not icky chemicals--that make this product the wonder that it is
this only works if you use it on a dry-ish face
i can't get enough of the regenerating cleanser.
i think of it more as a polisher than as a make-up remover because you definitely will not be using this remove your eye makeup
definitely not a makeup remover
it makes my skin tone even
this product doesn't irritate my skin
it does not leave that "squeaky" clean feeling
does not irritate skin at all
it does not leav your skin feeling dry if anything it feels refreshing
it's refreshing and feels non-drying.
otherwise my skin is clear
it's in a glass bottle with a pump.
i don't feel like my skin is being scrubbed
i generally do not use scrubby cleansers as they tend to simply cause damage to the skin
it doesn't irritate my skin at all
kind of feels like you are washing your face with a lotion
the scent doesn't bother me.
not too harsh of a scrub, smells great too.
note that this is not a makeup remover.
it's an expensive thing to have to throw away due to an allergy
i didn't think i had dull skin before i tried this cleanser
be careful if using for everyday use unless you're super oily as the micro beads do a great job of sloughing off oils/dead skin
it's not a bad smell - just intense.
i don't mind the smell at all
i also love that fact it's natural ingredients
it's more the consistency of a light cream
doesn't aggravate my skin
it doesn't irritate the skin
if you're not into scents
my eyes often feel tired and get oily.
i don't know if it actually exfoliates
one week in i'm still using it alone because it is so moisturizing that i don't feel the need for another layer
if you don't like your face products scented you probably won't like this
however it's an intense smell.
but my boyfriend can't stand the smell.
let's get pass that
i rather like the scent of this product
so maybe some people are just used to more synthetic fragrance
i feel like this product doesn't eliminate dark circles
even though it isn't cold by then it helps me use les product
i usually don't leave a review
i wouldn't want it to feel cool or cold under my eyes all day
this also doesn't have a scent to it
my under-eyes are not only puffy
concealer can't even fully cover my blue circles.
the puffiness did shrink on the eye i used it on compared to the one that i didn't use anything on
it didn't reduce the puffiness completely
doesn't irritate my eye
you can't tell my eyes were ever puffy
i usually use this before makeup
the artist at the mac store could not even make them dissappear
i actually preferred it without that extra "cold"-ness
doesn't leave my skin sticky
doesn't cause any irritations
i didn't feel the brightening
it's perfect for applying in the morning before starting your makeup
it's not sticky or anything like that
i can't wait to finish the jar
once absorbed you don't get the sticky feeling.
yet didn't offend my sensitive skin or make me oily throughout the day
when i don't use it i see a difference in my skin tone
this left my skin more dull than that which doesn't claim any illuminating benefits
there is never a hint of makeup residue.
i can say i very rarely get pimples now while using this wash
whether you use it with a clarisonic or your fingers
i love this cleanser because it's more like a dense foam
it works great with a clarisonic because it doesn't foam up uncontrollably
i find that it's non drying
has a great lather which allows me to use a small amount when i wash unlike a lot of other cream cleansers
does not get oily
doesn't leave my skin shiny
i don't wear makeup to work
i cannot believe this moisturizer has a few bad reviews
i love using this product before i put my makeup on because it isn't too heavy
i love that this moisturizer doesn't make my skin look shiny
doesn't make my skin more oily
it doesn't feel heavy or greasy
while it isn't greasy for me in the winter
it does little to nothing to prevent any blackheads
it's not too heavy
begin to itch if i don't use something
i've had a hard time finding a moisturizer that doesn't make me break out
nothing seems to tame my overactive t-zone
i still have to use a bit of matte primer on my t-zone help control oil
didn't clog my pores or anything like that
i would not repurchase again just because i can find a better moisturizer that wouldn't leave my skin shiny
maybe it's the combo of face wash i use
i feel like it's left my skin glowing
plus the algenist spf sublime defense day cream goes on so much nicer with this oil i didn't like it used under cream
i've seen reviews that say this product is too oily
doesn't leave the rest oily
honestly thought this oil would break me out as some super heavy moisturizers do or leave me with a grease slick
it does look greasy at first
it is not greasy at all.
doesn't make my skin oily and great moisturizer.
every so often my face gets angry
i can't speak to the anti-aging properties of this
less likely to need to pack on a super thick am moisturizer
i can't wear moisturizer on top of this though
even though i am careful to gently press the oil on my face
this stuff is liquid gold.
i can't rate it's effectiveness
flaking which it sometimes does because it's a moody little nose
there's hardly any smell at all to it.
it's too much for me to use daily because of my skin type
t doesn't feel oily
sometimes i wear just this
i even use a drop underneath my makeup
this oil can literally fix anything.
i usually get pimles that turn to scars
i can't believe it even got rid of a sun spot i had after like 2 or 3 months
i am a penny pincher with treatment products because they are overhyped
it actually prevents the occasional break outs i get
i am not being hyperbolic
or at least keeps the blemishes at bay if not providing the luminescence i deep down really want
i find it too oily for daytime use.
it doesn't seem to absorb quickly
doesn't clog my pores
doesn't make my makeup slide everywhere
absorbs quickly and doesn't seem heavy at all.
not greasydid not cause any breakouts or pimples
doesn't leave my skin feeling gross
i don't have many fine lines or wrinkles
the pores aren't so huge
it's not as oily as it usually is
it's not like your normal oil
i usually do not like the greasy way they feel on my skin or the fact that they don't really absorb all the way into my skin
doesn't leave skin greasy.
the down side was the fact that it was too oily for my skin which is normal/acne prone at 25
that even though it's an oil
just can't get past the smell
doesn't clog pores or cause breakouts
i don't need to use moisturizer as often
see if it helps her wrinkles
because i do tend to have a really oily t zone
if you're worried that you already have oily skin so maybe this isn't he product for you
so restorative i can't imagine my skin care routine without it
you do not have to wait to apply your moisture cream
it actually reduces how oily my skin is in the t-zone
the dropper lets you control how much to use
it's barely made a dent
i can't imagine taking it out of my skin care routine
telling me the whole thing about face oils make your face produce less oil because you're applying oil instead of just stripping it all the time
to my surprise it wasn't "oily" at all
it's just the best serum you'll ever use!
but.... the thing is.. it's so expensive.
this did not make me more oily
whatever may have oxidized is lightened to such a degree thats like they were always apart of your gorgeous face- a face that has an even skin tone
i don't think it's intended to prevent acne.
the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars was because it's not moisturizing
does not get me pimples
does not make me oily
this even my skin tone
i don't wear a moisturizer at night anymore
it will even out my skin tone
sometimes i even skip blush
my skin is just that much more radiant that i would hate to hide it
when i don't use it i notice that my skin gets dull
your skin won't look 10 years older"
it does have a weird smell
it's a basic part of my routine.
this stuff makes it so my moisturizer just completely seeps into my skin it seems super expensive
this stuff is liquid gold!
it's a must in everybody's night time routine.
it absorbs completely so there's no residue left over
i know it's pricey
my skin doesn't break out
i find it evens out my skintone
it just was getting all the gunk out of my skin.
i don't usually right reviews
i basically use a clarisonic type device to wash my face at night
how my acne was pretty much not as swilled or red
now can't sleep without it
since you constantly have to ope it germs can get in there
he normally doesn't even notice a new hair style!
i don't get all oily midday like i would with so many other moisturizers
it says it's for nighttime
which my skin usually is
this stuff seems to have an effect overnight
i hate serums that don't absorb right into the skin
i know it's pricey
when i use it more often i do also notice it lightens my freckles/sun spots
it could be used as a primer, it's that good.
some fine lines mostly in the places where i used to get bad breakouts
oh and the silicone in it isn't overbearing.
it's just the right balance
didn't get this with the hope of reducing wrinkles
if my face is oily as it tends to get by afternoon
when i have no makeup on my pores are smaller it's actually relle cool bc i was starting to think it was a lost cause
because this product will fill your pores with too much dimethicone
i can see little difference of my pores
i don't think it helped with pores though
i like that it's a pump and not a dropper .
my skin doesn't look even close
if you're one of the many people out there like myself who don't have invisible pores
it makes your skin look very smooth--you'd never know there were pores under your makeup
it's not an unpleasant smell.
does not make my face oily
can wear makeup over it
it leaves your skin so silky that you almost don't need a primer
even the prescription stuff from a dermatologist didn't make me presentable or comfortable
i even use it under my makeup.
seem to moisturize at the level i need
i would recommend you try it if you want a moisturizer that makes your skin feel soft
i never really use moisturizer before my make up because it tends to make my face greasier that it usually is
my only complaint is i feel it left my skin sort of greasy sometimes
it is not greasy at all
some people may find it too heavy with dry skin i feel it needs to be to do anything
it doesn't sting my sensitive skin
it's nourishing but not to heavy.
on days i don't use makeup
sometimes you have diffrent needs in your face
the only thing i don't like is that it sort of smells like chemicals
i don't notice any flakiness through out the day
it's pretty heavily scented so some people might not like that
it is not too oily and has spf 25.
doesn't feel greasy or shiny after
spf is a plus i don't have to put a separate spf that is too heavy on the face
pretty good -- it's non-sticky
the only thing that keeps this product from getting a 5 stars is when mix with a face primer or liquid foundation it flakes
he i don't get to oily through the day
this is probably the only moisturizer that didn't make me oily
doesn't cause excess oiliness is my t-zones yet helps to moisturize the areas that are dry or flakey
it's not clogging my pores
it's so pricey though
when i put it on its not oily
it's not too greasy or heavy feeling
my doesn't have anymore dry patches
my skin does not look oily by the end of the day.
unlike other foaming cleansers this one doesn't go all over the place when you rub it in which is a plus for me
i hate using milky cleansers because i feel like my face is still dirty afterwards
in fact i don't even wear concealer anymore
i felt like i was wasting product- thin oil like texture that would run down my finger before i could apply it
it's so light weight
that i don't look tired
you can pair it with pretty much any aye cream for extra care
it's smooth and light when applied with care.
there doesn't seem to be a scent
the shape of the little jar makes it difficult to get product out when it's on it's last legs
but it doesn't help much on reducing wrinkles.
you have to get the morning cream so that way it fixes any dryness that might be cause over night
i do not have puffiness or dark circles
t will feel a bit sticky if you use too much
it's not for bags
i sort of like the burn
it feels like it's tightening everything up.
obviously this eye cream won't erase your dark circles
i kind of feel like it's diminishing them
your eyes will love this this.
the ones in my brow are almost nonexistent.
the lines under my eyes didn't seem as deep
maybe it's just my super oily skin that's keeping me from looking closer to 20 than 30
there is hardly any scent to it
it doesn't creep into my eyes
like almost all other eye creams i have tried do
most cleansers don't, so that is a big bonus.
make sure you use as a mask after you've cleansed
it's $3 less at macy's which is were i usually by it
if you don't use a serum tho i have discovered that it makes your skin feel like rubber
magine the acne i get not to mention i already had acne prone oily skin
because i know that it gets rid of all my makeup
--meaning i don't have to bring a cleanser
is that it can really burn your eyes if you aren't careful during mascara removal
not have my eyes burn
even the most stubborn stains of foundation are removed in a matter of seconds-its perfect
it really cleans your face of any dirt
you only need a drop and you get tons of lather.
i don't like to use products that dry my face out as i am trying to beat wrinkles as well
it's great for all skins it eliminates oil without drying out your face
so a lot of cleansers are really irritating
which is good for people's skin that is mildly oily like mine
this stuff seriously makes your face feel squeaky clean
i love that squeaky clean feeling when you wash your face which this does
i can just feel my pores tightening
i didn't have to worry about my face drying up
usually anything that cleans so thoroughly strips my skin
you only need a little dab
this product makes my pores dissappear!
did cause some pore congestion n i notice extra oily-ness throughout the day
and it does a lot for my cuticles too.
waiting to see if it'll help with my acne prone skin
it doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy
it didn't make me shiny
protect it because it's definitely a holy grail
doesn't make my hair ends look greasy
the hydration doesn't last forever
doesn't make me more oily
your worried about if it's going to be too heavy for you or leave stickiness
don't even bother using coconut oil on the face because that will cause you breakouts
you'll be better off with the travel size
i didn't want to buy the original because i have combo/oily skin
i don't use it everyday
it's great for oily skin
it's not slippery and is easily absorbed by skin.
i never got oily or horrible
i didn't break out other than some other spots from waxing
does not make me look oily
not greasy at all
i noticed i didn't get shiny at all
i can't wear my makeup without it
i've worn it under makeup with no issues either
this is the only moisturizer that doesn't break out my very acne prone face
it seems whenever i use this product my skins tends to behave
my mascara seems to smear very easily when i put this around my eyes
it sort of sits on your face doesn't absorb into your skin initially
i wake up with skin that is not an oil slick-amazing
it's not too oily and have a lovely consistency.
i feel like it adds moisture where i need it without making the oily parts feel too heavy or cakey
doesn't leave your skin feeling like its got a film or stickiness
it said on the box that it's light enough to use under makeup
this oil is light enough
it's light enough that i don't feel more pores are going to clog
on the days i don't wear any makeup
it actually helps to keep my skin less oily throughout the day
4 stars because it's on the pricier side
it soaks in nice, doesn't leave an oil residue.
i cannot believe how amazing my skin looks in spite of my eczema
it does not leave me oily.
it's to much for my skin
it's amazing to use with makeupapply one or two drops with the foundation
i mean within 3 hours of makeup i'm an oil slick.
doesn't make me feel greasy.
it's not greasy at all.
my skin doesn't absorb my makeup
so your face doesn't have that greasy feeling since i have oily/combo skin
this doesn't aggravate my skin at all.
and it doesn't make me feel oily.
it moisturizers and doesn't make me break out.
this light oil does it all!
not become oily, but actually sweat.
no matter how thick or thin the cream/gel was or how much i would apply my skin would just start sweating
it's great for my oily skin
thinking that they would impart some "magic" anti-aging benefits that this just didn't have
it's so hard for me not to slather this all over my body
so the regular oil doesn't absorb well for me
i sometimes wear it during the day under my primer
doesn't feel like a grease slick
you only need like 3 or 4 drops for your whole face
it doesn't actually like i said it gives the perfect glow
it's not an oily look at all
well my face is a greasy mess 24/7
i often avoid using a moisturizer because i'm so afraid of breaking myself out
i like to use a drop or two on the ends of my hair if it's looking dry
not so quickly that you find yourself needing to incessantly reapply in order to feel like your skin is quenched
the scent doesn't bother me
although it doesn't make me less oily either
when you put it on you may think it's kinda greasy
because it's an oil
otherwise it's a great product
it doesn't cause breakouts
don't be intimidated on putting beauty oils on your face even if you're oily
not only that it hydrates your face well
so light and doesn't have a strong smell.
doesn't leave you looking greasy
i don't even use foundation or concealer anymore
thank goodness that they decided to make a light version of the argan oil for someone with sensitive skin
makes your face glowy
i would also say it's good for acne prone skin too
at $65 it's a bit on the pricey side
not greasy at all
i found that though it's super thick it actually absorbs really well
after using a lot of serums that tend to always leave my face oily or shiny
that's normal these days if you care about saving your skin right?
doesn't really give a instant moisture to my skin
it there is no annoying smell
that's because it doesn't contain the usual silicones even some natural creams contain
i don't seem to get dark spots as easily now either
the only semi-flaw is the way it slightly irritates tour eyes if you get it in your eyes
it's not that painful
takes all of my makeup off & no irritation.
it's scary how much makeup residue this stuff picks up
love the scent too, it's so fresh!
i sometimes use it as a dupe for the sisley primer
plus you don't need to rinse it off either!
it doesn't sting my eyes
would not use this a regular cleanser as the residue left behind doesn't make my skin look or feel as clean as my regular water / product combination
doesn't irritate my skin
i just wouldn't use it for waterproof eye makeup because it takes a bit of work to get it off
lazy to wash my face
i get this cause i like the smell.
no mess, no hassle, easy to use.
you don't wash it off
also, it's helped my skin look more glowy.
this really does the trick without stinging
find that i don't have the greasy
it didn't remove eye makeup
gets almost all of the most stubborn mascara
didn't leave a residue or taste bad
i got allergic to many types of things
doesn't leave me tight or red
which isn't much after the cleanser
it removes everything that my cleanser doesn't
the best part is that it doesn't need to be rinsed off as i don't use water to wash my face
it is perfect for taking off face makeup or powder-type makeup
it's not as effective when it comes to eye makeup such as mascara or anything that contains oil or some thickness to it
it's not really a big problem for me because usually i cleanse my face again with a different cleanser after the first general wipe
i might purchase the full bottle when i'm out of the sample because i like the fact that it's very gentle yet effective to be part of my double cleansing routine
not tight or greasy like the other two br
i promise you'll fall for it too
it's amazing what is leftover after you wash your face
since everyone's skin isn't the same
i didn't find it sticky at all
also for rinsing my face when i don't want to wash it
i don't usually use it by itself because it feels like cheating
i wouldn't reccomend using it to remove eyeliner or any make up too close to your eyes as it was very uncomfortable
it's perfect for sensitive skin or someone prone to breakouts or jut someone who wants to simplify their routine without losing any benefits
it does a great job removing my light makeup without making my skin tight or sticky
such a clean feeling without actually washing my face
no sticky residue that you would expect from using a product rather than just washing with water
i can't seem to switch after using caudalie
even removed the kylielipkit lipstick that is really difficult to get off
not oily or dry like the different wipes ive used do
if you put on a color you don't like
i took one star off because it really shouldn't be called a makeup remover
i would not recommend it as a makeup remover to someone who wears very heavy makeup since i think you would go through several cotton pads to get it all off
that might irritate your skin
i hate oil based removers because they irritate my eyes this takes off every single speck of waterproof makeup i have on my eyes
there's no harsh chemicals and it cleanses well.
perfect for getting off that overnight grime when you don't feel like washing your face
doesn't feel heavy or slimy perfect to use at end of day or first thing in morning
it also doesn't have parabens which i try avoid.
if you tend to be a bit lazy
plus it's so friendly to girls with sensitive skin like myself that it does not burn at all-it's literally like water
only downside is that it does not really remove waterproof mascara
smell nice to me, and it's not expensive.
manages the oil that i even use it sometimes in the middle of the day on those oily areas
it really gets rid of the extra makeup
i love it, but it can be a little annoying.
did not burn my eyes like most make up removers
doesn't feel like other makeup removers
i only use it on my eye makeup
this one not only cleans off all the makeup
it doesn't leave an oily residue like some other cleansers do
even though it's a tad than other makeup cleansers
im very lazy on removing my makeup
i don't even have to rinse after?
don't feel like washing my face
it doesn't remove eye makeup well
i say this because it's not made with harmful chemicals
i can't seem to find make up removers like this at the drug store anymore
it does not strip my face
it does not take off eye makeup
or if ido a mask i use this to get off those stubborn parts by hairline etc def a staple in my routine
i love that i don't have to rinse it off
doesn't burn at all
it's non harsh on the eye area.
it just feels kind of sticky on my face
t feel harsh or too rough on my skin
due to the price those of you with oily skin may not get the full benefits of a mask like this
if you don't like the smell or consistency of honey
they could do damage if you scrub your face with this mask
i just ordered my second jar today as i can't imagine my skin routine without it
it's my treat to my skin once a week
this product gets rid of my winter dullness
usually i'm not a huge fan of hydrating masks
i slathered it on my face not knowing it cost $140
sticky but makes your face feel amazing!!
sometimes my skin gets irritated
nothing was ever thick enough to penetrate
yes, it's a little tacky but nothing too serious.
it is rather sticky on your face
for winter months i dare say this is the most hydrating
putting raw honey on your face more that likely
not heavy like some masks
does not irritate my skin.
most amazing mask that will transform your skin to softness you didn't think was possible
we're talking about softer than baby's skin
there's still 3/4 of the jar left
it's not like a wow i have no wrinkles anymore antiaging mask
so for me it's like the sugar face polish amped up with honey
but i can't get past the smell!!
it is not as heavy as you'd think
try this moisturizer out because it will change your skin for the better
would not recommend to someone with oily skin as it may be a bit too rich
doesn't leave my combination skin too oily
it does sit on the skin
can look a bit greasy
it does leave my skin feeling a little tacky
im crossing my fingers that it doesn't stop working
i just need a moisturizer that doesn't make me break out
someone at sephora recommended this one instead of the dramatically different gel that i find doesn't hydrate enough
won't make me too greasy
trust because it doesn't cause further reactions if i'm having an allergic reaction
i sometimes wear it as a night cream.
this is honestly one of the best products i have found for super dry skin that doesn't leave your skin with a weird heavy residue
also light enough to not cause my acne prone skin to break out
one that also didn't make my skin feel dirty after cleansing
there's nothing like it
can't live without it- especially in the winter
it's not greasy or too sticky.
it doesn't make my face feel oily.
i love how it sits on your skin
doesn't sink in super fast
is the makeup my mom wears
this isn't greasy, heavy and doesn't wear off.
goes on smooth and not greasy.
it's not too greasy
does not make you oily at all either
it's actually the lotion
that's when the smell hit me.
it doesn't smell like chemicals or like feet even
when you rub it in
while it may be a tiny bit greasy when applied it sinks in super quikly
it also doesn't have a scent which is what bothers me about most moisturizers
i've found that i don't love this product for everyday use under makeup because i find my makeup just doesn't sit well on it
i wasn't a big fan of the thickness of the lotion
plus it's easy to apply
it doesn't have a chemical smell
doesn't leave my skin feeling oily or greasy
it does not clog pores nor does it leave you oily
one it having no scent which i love
it never irritates my skin
doesn't clog my pores
are using too much of your lotion
never leaves me greasy or creates breakouts
they either leave my skin feeling bad or irritate my skin
however i only like it when i use it with a facial oil otherwise it has a tacky feeling on my skin
this product doesn't leave me feeling greasy
there's a reason that our mothers used this product
it's just a staple product you need in your daily skin care routing
then i realized that 98% of the bad reviews are from people with oily skin
but that is probably because they have oily skin.
it's so light it is perfect for under the eyes.
puffiness when i don't sleep enough
not good if u are looking to see some lines or puffiness reduced
doesn't leave the eye area greasy
it doesn't irritate my eyes like some creams i've used
i don't wear foundation or cover up, nothing!
light so you can use before applying makeup
doesn't leave an oily finish
does not sting my eyes
i don't have fine lines
not irritating at all
it does not sting my eyes.
not because it's fundamentally getting rid of my dark circles
it's like it comes out white
it's because it soaks in so quickly
i want to feel greasy free
i can wear it under makeup.
probably not good if you have oily skin
as i've never had luck finding a moisturizer that doesn't break me out
i don't need a heavy cream after all that other stuff
my t-zone is prone to extreme breakouts if my moisturizers are clogging up my pores
or make me look dull
i feel like nothing can cleanse it off
if you put anything on this moisturizer before it's dries complety then it will would not work its magic
gives you the spf you need
blends easily onto skin so you dont have to apply too much
i do not feel any dryness during the day
this lotion doesn't make me shinny
the oily skin was pretty bad
the scent is kinda heavy compare to a lot of other moisturizers
does not leave me or oily or greasy
they weren't clogged or anything
afterwards your face doesn't feel like it has a film of residue on it
does not feel oily at all
doesn't cause break outs on my sensitive skin.
it's also great that it doesn't make my face feel greasy since it absorbs so quickly
it doesn't absorb too well for my skin
it's lightweight and doesn't feel oily.
i do feel the need to add a beauty oil for my cheeks
that's to be expected with combo skin
lotion-y texture for day time- it's not too greasy
it's not too heavy either
it's light enough that you don't feel it on your skin
doesn't leave your skin greasy or parched either.
i didn't found my face to be glittery
i don't know if it's this or the solid cleansing oil that i got that has been making my face glow
i feel it's good for adults who need nourishment for their skin to prevent the appearance of aging
i don't spend the extra money on the ibuki cleanser or softener because i don't find it necessary
please don't forget that drinking lots of water helps your skin a ton too
even though it's a really light moisturizer
you actually don't need to use that much product for your skin to feel hydrated
really haven't ever found a moisturizer that won't make my face a grease bucket in a couple of hours
my face didn't get greasy by the end of the day
the other moisturizer was making my skin freak out
doesn't feel oily or sticky
except there is no spf
didn't leave a bunch of product buildup
finally found a moisturizer that doesn't cause break outs or irritation
maybe even your neck
doesn't break me out or make my face irritated
it has always been a struggle for me to find a moisturizer that tackled my dry/oily combo skin without making my t-zone feel heavy
i even noticed my face doesn't get oily as much
doesn't mind the smell
does not leave your skin looking oily
i do like the scent even tho it is a bit over powering
i dont have much open pores
my t zone not at all greasy or oily
it's changed my life
it doesn't burn or turn me red
i need the softener because it takes away my flaky skin
i didn't notice a heavy smell
this is my go to moisturizer when i can afford to splurge
it doesn't give you "perfect" face
it doesn't linger after you rub it in
but the scent can be annoying to some people:(
it doesn't cause breakouts
doesn't leave you oily even during the day
it's actually reduced the size of my pores
doesn't leave you oily even during the day
my cheeks are no longer flakey
great option for problem skin which is not oily
they're so big that you can cut them in half if you focus on your problem areas with the product
i always have some dark spots from acne
i do still get some pimples
the sting means they're working- power through!
after a few days it's only mildly tingly
the application does sting a little
it does make your face tingle which is kind of annoying
itches for the first couple times you use it
it doesn't itch after a few uses
my skin does not feel dried out or raw from use
i will forever use this product in my skin care routine
benzoyl peroxide doesn't do anything
salicylic acid does barely anything on its own
itch the ish out of your skin
getting rid of any breakouts that make their way to the surface
i noticed it's because of the amount of zits
i can't put any cosmetics on my skin without them being oil free as i break out the same day so even with the sting this has when applying it doesn't bother me one bit
yes, it does sting and burn.
yes, it is uncomfortable.
you'll see the results
if you suffer from acne
it does burn- you may want to do a small patch test before applying it all over just in case it's too painful for your skin type
yeah it does burn/itch right away
i found that applying it directly to my skin as too irritating
the burning sensation is so bad everytime i use it i tear up
my acne scars are even starting to fade too.
it does sting a bit
it's not anything unbearable
which is odd because i am a vib rouge member
trying not to ever touch my face in fear of irritating my already congested pores
its tolerable if your not a big baby
if you are struggling with surface acne caused by all the makeup you wear
these wipes are so easy to use.
is the tickle on certain areas its working its magic on
it's a vicious cycle where i get a series of breakouts
they weren't as red
i didn't find it to be unbearable
normally i would wuss out
i would talk to a dermatologist or a skin expert before trying these out
as for my review on the pads they're beautiful for my skin
so this product loses a star because it really is almost painful to use these pads
your face will itch like crazy when you put them on --
if you're thinking about trying this to combat acne
got rid of all of the gunk that was deep in my skin i couldn't squeeze out
where did your big zits go
rarely do i rate stuff on spear
you'll eventually see the difference on your skin
goes aways when you put moisturizer on
tried these pads as i really want this acne scarring to go away
"the pill" alone isn't quite enough to tame my face volcanoes
don't do anything for my acne
doesn't turn me into a dry flaky mess
i don't even get regular pimples anymore.
this stuff makes my face itch!
it feels like it's burning
these pads take care of zits like nothing i have come across
ointment they could throw at me
if your like me with stubborn acne
yes the itching is intense
if it is itching insanely for five minutes i'll live
so for the amount of pads you get
doesn't burn with application
it doesn't dry my skin out too bad either
this stuff smells nasty
though if you apply moisturizer quickly it's not bad at all
tingles, stings, but gets the job done.
it's clearing my acne.
it's even lightening the dark spots from my dark days
it stings but that's fine because it works.
i tend to get under the skin pimples that last a good 1-2 weeks
also get those annoying little bumps along my cheeks
even during that first week i noticed my skin wasn't as oily
they're super saturated with the medicine
not melt your face like some acne products
i don't put it everywhere
it does itch (a lot).
it doesn't sting for me.
once you get over the itch i do believe it clears up my pimples
it doesn't seem to dry out my skin either like some strong products can
yes these are tingly for the first few days you use them
your skin gets used to it
i wish he made a jar with 100 pads!
you need literally a pencil's eraser amount for your whole face
doesn't strip my face
have you ever have that icky feeling when you're face has a layer of oil whether it's on your t zone or throughout your face
if you want to find an organic line to help make your face literally squeaky clean this is the one to do the job
this isn't really an exfoliation even though it has the beads in it
does not strip my skin as some other cleansers for oily skin seem to
because i don't have to worry about removing anything from my face or having it flake onto anything
i usually use one layer first and rub it in.
afterwards there's just this soothing comfort
have been searching the quenching-enough mask forever
don't wipe it out
it does not contain alot of irritating ingredients
it's not easy to find masks for dry skin so when i saw this product
or whenever your skin feels blah
this doesn't irritate or clog pores
try it - you'll love it!
on any days that i wear makeup
on days that i don't wear makeup
i start to notice my skin getting irritated if i don't use this product consistently
even-toned that i thought the delta lounge mirrors were playing tricks on me
i can't justify the price to use every day after a good night's sleep
the cleanser does stink
nothing else comes off after i use this cleanser
love this cleanser, but it stinks.
if it's good enough for the folks at vogue
i then feel fancy using it?
it even took off my toofaced better than sex waterproof mascara
yes, the smell is bad.
smells don't usually bother me
i could actually save $$ on makeup removers from now on
it's almost like using shea
a smelly risk i'm more than willing to take on the daily because it melts makeup away like a dream
because it certainly feels oily to the touch
if i use anything foamy
still "acting up" with little patches of breakouts in my t-zone
i am lazy, so i don't want the work.
i know such trouble causes for a in home facial clean is a thing that people tends to avoid
this is like a facial you give to yourself at home
i didn't need to wash it again after cleansing with this
only downside is the smell is a bit odd.
i found that it didn't do that good a job at taking my waterproof mascara off
i found it's texture too oily
didn't think it cleansed my face all that well
though this cleansing balm is not cheap
i tried a few other makeup melts
it spreads easily once it's warmed by your body temperature so you really only need to use a tiny bit
which makes me wonder if the ingredients in the cleanser are really worth what they're charging
i usually hesitate to use the term "holy grail" with a product because even if i am in love it usually fades
it's does not burn or irritate the eyes!
it doesn't dry you out like a lot of cleansers do
this cleanser is absolutely amazing it's the only balm/oil based cleanser i've tried that i actually feel clean after
doesn't burn my eyes
i am not tempted because i just don’t feel the same depth of cleanse or the sort of
it doesn't linger on the skin once you rinse it
when i used this cleaner they're almost all gone
it's better than all the cleansers i've used.
it actually soothes my skin when i am breaking out
i would not use this if you have oily skin
i don't use it everyday
this isn't a cleanser you can slap on
i need to get some lotion on asap feeling
i don't need to use toner anymore.
considering the fact that it's a wash
it's a great cleanser that removes all you make up
when you rub this cleanser all over your face it really seems to get into the pores depending on how long you rub
the greasy texture may put some people off.
i love the fact that i can use it on my eyes without stinging
there's a little insert that comes in the box explaining how to properly massage your face
it makes you take your time
too---to me it's not chamomile
my skin isn't flaking at all anymore
because nothing does for skin what eve lom cleansing does
just like with every other cleanser
because it's a little pricey i try other cleansers to see if they will make me skin as clear as this will
it's always a pleasure to use this cleanser!
i normally get a pimple or 2 at that time of the month
it's just that eve lom brings my skin
the makeup removal oils would not really remove any makeup since there was so much left on the wipe
i would get zits
waterproof liner doesn't st
if you try to use is likea regular cleanser you are setting yourself up for dissapointment
i know it's a bit pricy
i sometimes get lazy
do not cleanse often
though it's not obvious sleep aromatherapy
i wouldn't recommend using it to remove heavy makeup
it's not just a makeup remover cleanser
but i would not recommend to super oily skin.
before using it i recommend you look up oil cleansing method otherwise you may be disappointed with no lather
this cleanser didn't mess with either
even though i didn't out the cleansing balm on my eyes
no because the smell it has a really unpleasant smell
my skin is becoming more cushy
this is much more hygienic it works wonders use a small dab right on your pimple
it's a bit weird to apply
acne prone skin -- please give this mask a try
the smell doesn't bother me
their deep cleansing mask did nothing for my breakouts
you cannot move your mouth
it does have a smell
it's very still when it comes out of the tube
melts into your skin while you're wearing it
it wasn't a film on my skin
the smell doesn't bother me as it smells more natural than something that is over-perfumed
it doesn't make your skin feel squeaky clean
often after using this i'll forget to put moisturizer on
once it's on my skin i barely notice it
not that you are squeaky clean
this cleanser does not irritate
not perfumey like some skin care products can be
it's a bit lighter for am face washing when you don't have make up removal needed
this doesent dehydrate your skin at all
doesn't leave my combination skin oily at all
even though i hate the smell of the cleanser
gets even waterproof makeup off
or you are going to look like a raccoon
i however will not use the original night time cleanser because i am not fond of the chemical laden ingredients
massage into dry skin for as long as you'd like
the only thing i dislike is the scent
i do find it unpleasant
the fact that it is non-stripping for my dry-ish
i don't know how well it removes makeup
i love how it cleanses my no-make-up face without stripping my skin
comes off easily with water that you don't need to wash your face w soap
it's amazing what a cleanser can do.
it doesn't strip the skin.
there's no strange smell
doesn't cause me to break out or get red due to sensitivity
it's just not for your skin is all
use sparingly can't express enough
sometimes i use the day cream by itself
plus it doesn't irritate my skin
real oily over here
isn't too greasy for my summer skin
it is light weight enough that i don't wake up still feeling like i have a heavy lotion on my face
too bad i couldn't deal with the smell.
i absolutely hate most moisturizers because they never seem to soak into my skin
this is the only retinol-derivative that i've tried that doesn't make my skin react horribly
real oily over here
it does not irritate my skin
it got too irritating for my skin
it does clear up my dark spots from my occasional breakouts
i don't even use eye cream
it does sting slightly, and that's the truth!
or you'll counter all the good you did
different color, smell and it didn't work!
never irritates my skin
so you will need one of those two if you have dryness around your eyes
you should be careful using it if you're spending time in the sun
this isn't irritating in the slightest
degrade the ingredients--i don't know why anyone uses products that come in jars
not big enough for the dermatologist to extract
it could be wishful thinking
although it did tingle a little once i applied this product
don't have any heavy wrinkles yet
it doesn't even make my eyes water
the minor sensation makes me think it's working
i don't have too many wrinkles around my eyes
does it come in a jar packaging that's totally unsanitary
don't get it near the eyes because it stings a bit
you'll see the difference
i don't mind the scent now
the eye cream lives up to it's name - super.
it actually makes my concealer glide on a bit easier
i want something that isn't too oily
anyone seeking a non-irritating eye cream with a decent level of sun protection needs to try this one
this eye cream does wonders for my eyes.
i usually wear it alone
doesn't bug my contacts, either.
it doesn't have a weird residue
it doesn't ball up or pill when i layer items over it
i do not find that it leaves a white cast at all
maybe it does or doesn't provide the spd protection because it has light
even though almost everything with spf usually does
doesn't make my mascara run if i don't use a lid primer
is not irritating or stinging
there is not heavy scent at all
did not sting/irritate my eye
it's hard to find an eye moisturizer with adequate coverage
i don't know if there is even another spf eye cream on the market
it does not melt into your eyes
nor burn or sting
even though it's a bit pricy
sometimes it leaves white marks as spf does sometimes
i guess the only downside is that because of the sunscreen you end up with a slight white-ish cast under the eyes
i only use this in the morning because i read it's good for puffiness
it doesn't leave my under-eye area looking too shiny the way murad did
can't give it 5 stars
it does not go on super smooth
this one doesn't make my face feels oily
i don't mind it as it dissipates
it's still not empty
tried a bunch of products to lighten it
when after 3 -4 very small applications of this product it's 50% faded
i will not buy it again though as i feel that it is kind of useless to put it under my tinted moisturizer
if you want to cover any dark spots or imperfections without using any makeup
i don't get pimples or redness anymore
i don't use it all over my face
he doesn't notice my hair color
have to make sure to up my spf under my makeup or i feel a little bite when the sun comes out
i only use it at night because it makes my skin appear a tad greasy
once applied you do not see any of the glitter on your face because the particles are very small
don't think that just because you are medium skin toned you need the medium
there's no way to open the container
since my dad's from sicily i don't need anymore red undertones in my skin
if you wash your skin
i can see people getting acne if they use moisturizer on top of it
i don't use it all over my face
somehow, my face isn't near as oily either.
except for maybe some under-eye concealer
bone up on your sunscreen as it doesn't come equipped with any
it does not clog my pores which i have a problem with usually
glowing when i wake up which would never happen with any traditional drying acne products
it's never too early to start using night creams
it's rich, but not heavy or thick.
i like this night cream because it is rich
without all that junk in my pores
this actually helped combat the hormonal acne that popped up during that week too
i usually don't use moisturizer at night
i tend to notice lots of blackheads that weren't there before
if i resist messing with them
for the past several years i have not used any moisturizer other than california baby everyday lotion because my skin tends to react
plus i do not get those many zits
doesn't feel heavy once on
does not clog my pores or cause breakouts
light scent, not too anything.
if your starting to get facial hairs this somehow magically retards them
the only downside to this is that i think it personally smells like bile
you almost don't need a moisturizer afterward
i don't feel like it's stripping out oils
because it's so foamy
it does not do as well on waterproof mascara
it's hard enough to deal with aging
nothing that my drugstore moisturizer doesn't help right away
is not least bit irritating
i find that it didn't quite remove my eye makeup
i don't really want to use exfoliating products on my eye anyway
this does not make my skin irritated
gets eye makeup off too without my using other eye makeup remover
would leave it too oily
i don't wear makeup
it's like giving your skina big glass of water
i can't stop using this cleanser.
it does the trick perfectly
doesn't leave my face feeling stripped of it's moisture
won't go back to any other cleansers--it makes my skin soft
clears up acne better than murad acne stuff
i don't wear too much makeup so don't need an intense cleanser--
i don't even feel the need to wear skin makeup anymore
sometimes i stray from this cleanser
it isn't easily washed out
don't let the pearl-like appearance freak you out
it's very concentrated---so you need very little---like the size of your fingernail---literally
it's in cream form
the blackheads were so tiny it's not like i could squeeze them out either
doesn't leave your face dried out
the cleansing cream did a good job of removing every bit of dirt
know that it really does cleanse
other cleansers of this type seem to leave my face oily
it balanced out my skin so that it is not flaky
not too dying, and not too oily.
the best part is that you only need a little bit to cleanse your face
it does not dry my face out nor does it leave it greasy
if you are trying to wash your face of makeup etc
it's really so gentle
my skin looks even
it doesn't really exfoliate as much as you may think
not heavy or fake smelling like many cleansers
have tried alot of different face cleansers
it doesn't sting at all
does make a difference in my skin
usually i find something
if you cant afford it to start than get the cleansing cream
just another tip: if you haven't tried a tool similar to the clarisonic scrubbing brush
i normally do not think of cleansers are being special
or are basically unremarkable
i tend to wash my face then apply it
it's almost like a peel.
i tend to have red cheeks no matter how much moisturizer or serum i use that are supposed to clear them up
don't wash it off
if you are one with combination to dry skin buy this i promise you'll not need another moisturizer or face mask
redness it is mild enough to use every day
i don't have oily skin therefore i can't make any promises there
i am sure of how this product applies a bit sticky while applying it
this mask did not irritate my skin
almost everything irritates it
i tend to sleep with it on as a treatment.
used too many peel pads
and it does not irritate the skin.
tacky feeling that lingers for a bit as it dries
i saw my skin so dull
in comparison to another's "overrated" products that make skin break-out or with patches
it's a nice cooking mask
it is getting rid of my acne.
you can apply a thick layer let it sit for awhile then rinse or use it like a moisturizer before bed
know i simply have my normal acne
for the people who think this product burns your skin
it'll feel like burning
it's difficult sometimes to find one that one break me out
my only complaint is this mask tickles my face in an annoying way when it's drying
fear not because now you can leave the bathroom without a blotchy red face
i just slather this stuff on
acne prone- that's where this stuff has been a holy grail for me
this doesn't irritate me at all
while i don't break out all that often
my only negative to it is that when you rinse it off
you can't just wash it off quickly.
when it's time to rinse off
i'd like to not have to spend as much time rinsing it off as i do putting it on
i didn't give 5 stars because the effect is very subtle
nicer without a greasy after look
i cannot give this product five stars because it says that it detoxes my face
while it looks less greasy on my t zone i still have blackheads
it's feels like your skin is cold
i can even use powder makeup again!
i know it's pricey
i always have a few zits or trouble spots
any zits i had are gone
it's so refreshing to use this mask after a long day wearing makeup
it's an cow quick enlightening mask.
it doesn't clog pores
but maybe i'm just a sloppy sleeper :p
does not make my skin greasy
it's not harsh at all
when i apply it it's cold
not to the point of where my eyes will get too oily
my skin doesn't love trying new things as much as i do so my skin will either have an allergic reaction or get really irritated with bumps
not to mention it leaves my face feeling plump
if i am wearing heavier makeup or waterproof eye makeup i do need to use a cleansing wipe first to get my face really clean
sometimes need a little extra to get stubborn mascara off
it doesn't dry out skin like other cleansers sometimes do
i don't like using it around my eyes
i know it is weird to rub it in your face like lotion
my face never feels oily or greasy after i use it either
does not make my skin oily
when i'm not wearing makeup
usually 2-3 pumps are enough for me
i find 3-4 pumps can get all my makeup off
does not foam for those of you who prefer ones that foam
nothing outrageous just like any shampoo
warning: this cleanser is perfection if you don't have the clarisonic
it doesn't make you dry or feel stripped
my face doesn't have that tight
if you wear a lot of eye makeup
you'll need a separate makeup remover for that
i don't wear too much makeup
however it's not as good as removing eye makeup.
even my eye makeup
it doesn't feel greasy on my face
doesn't leave an oily feel
it can even be used in your hair.
i usually use this stuff in my night time skin care routine
it absorbs so fast so wearing this under makeup is not an issue
even for my combination skin
gives your skin an extra layer of moisture while not making it overly shiny
i didn't want to risk making my skin too oily.
sometimes redness can be an issue
it is not greasy
not too heavy now that it's spring
does not leave a greasy feeling on my skin
it doesn't make your skin feel oily at all.
it is not greasy
find myself craving it during the day
not greasy at all
still does not make my face look greasy
it's also helped with my laugh lines
it's a staple in my morning
flaky skin doesn't break out from it
this oil is not greasy
you only need like 1-2 drops
there's no greasy feeling it just absorbs
it does not leave a greasy feeling on my skin
i can't say enough about the packaging which is relatively spill-proof
it did not leave my skin feeling oily or greasy as i would have expected
it would be way too oily for me
it's on the pricey side
super flaky skin everywhere else
doesn't leave the face shiny.
never irritates my skin
make it possible for me to just make facial expression without feeling like my skin will rip
i don't have an oily t zone or flaky skin i don't need to use that super exfoliant anymore
this is even better because it's not greasy or shiny
whenever i'm having a bad skin day
it's not oily at all
it doesn't ball up or pill on the skin
i don't find it overpowering at all
i would much prefer if it came in a jar like the ceramidin gel cream or the ceramidin oil balm
occasionally when my face is dyer than usual
it's decent under concealer for example around the nose
trust me, i have ridiculously oily skin.
this is almost mattifying which makes it perfect as a makeup primer too
the tube doesn't squeeze well
doesn't leave my face feeling oily
nothing really cured it
didn't try it right away because it's thicker
needed something that won't irritate my skin
it's only day 3 of using this
moisturizers either didn't do anything for my dry skin or it would make my skin oily
i always have dry patches that peek out through my makeup no matter what i use
flawlessly that i almost can't wait to wash my face
i hate creams that feel greasy
those tend to not give me enough moisture in certain area
even though it's a tad pricey
it comes with a small metal tube-wringer that helps you to get the the product out without too much waste
the next morning i don't have any flakiness or any excess oil
it's really smooth after you apply the cream
i can even put it on my lips
the only thing i'm iffy on is the packing.
it can leave an oily residue so use a very small amount or it's impossible to put makeup over it
i just can't resist touching my face after applying it
it doesn't break me out or feel greasy works well with my oils
with this moisturizer i don't have to reply throughout the day or worry about flaky skin
can feel the slightest bit oily to the touch
it has not caused any breakouts where other moisturizers do
i also love the you get a little tube-squeezer to get every last bit out
it doesn't burn on application
i can be flakey
my skin doesn't look
scent if it's not strictly necessary
try the liquid treatment if the smell bothers you
it did not leave my face shiny
t can absorb by your skin really quick
the only thing is that it smells a little medicine-y?
true cetaphil as my face wash
i pat it in until it's fully absorbed
this stuff hits all my needs in a simple tube
it's not super heavy either and i like the scent.
this stuff isn't greasy
however, the packaging is horrid.
cons: doesn't play well with makeup.
makeup didn't blend well over it
money trying to find the perfect moisturizer that wouldn't break me out
don't let the word cream intimidate you.
not unpleasant or overpowering
doesn't leave my face like a grease slick
it's pretty pricey though.
i don't like the scent of it
it does not irritate my skin at all or leave it red
i think i may have found my go to moisturizer
does not clog my pores.
doesn't make me shiny
origins ginzing moisturizer had this effect unfortunately
it doesn't leave me oily like the bobbi brown does
doesn't leave me oily looking
it's been hard to find the perfect cream for my face because i have eczema
t does not leave your skin with a sticky feeling
maybe when i start seeing lines or wrinkles i'll revisit the expensive creams
i love any sort of skin care product
perfect texture to keep my face free of extra oil that can trigger acne for me
doesn't linger for long
which usually happens to me whenever it's cold
it might feel thick at first
doesn't clog my pores
jart's ceramidin cream has eliminated the flaky skin that i am supposed to be getting by starting renova
my skin is not greasy
it's even more awesome if you use it in conjunction with ceramidin liquid
the only down side is that it's a bit pricey for me
-acne mess i have the misfortune of dealing with
will not let this product out of my clutches
it's as if you don't know how irritated your skin is until you smooth this on
my usual moisturizer wasn't keeping up
never irritates my skin
doesn't irritate my skin or cause breakouts which is a safe haven for me
i get a pimple here
when i put highlighter on it's a nightmare!!!
feels lovely after you get over the initial oh it's not a cream moment
yet enough to use on it's own if you're having an "oily week
my skin sometimes looks dull
i like this because it doesn't irritate my sensitive skin
doesn't irritate your skin or clog pores.
it is light weight not weird
i did get some pimples
skin type you have
while it doesn't reduce redness it definitely doesn't make things worse
they're the only ones that combat dryness
my makeup would always look so flaky by the end of the day
in the summer heat i used it on it's own
especially considering i can't exfoliate
on the corners of my mouth--not sure if it's age
this product went smoothly on my face yes it's a little bit sticky once it dried out
even pricey products would make my skin break out
it's so easy to use
it's simply going to be very hydrating
my skin stays clear unless i use a product that clogs my pores
it's been a long battle.
i will occasionally add a drop of nude oil into the liquid before i apply if my skin feels tight
one day it's super oily
you don't need a lot to use for your face
this doesn't break my skin out or irritate my eczema patches
i kind of dig the basic clean packaging too.
even though it's not a serum, i use it as one.
can't describe my feelings for this ceramidin liquid
flaky to the point where it looks like i'm breaking out
some days i scratch so much, i bleed!
it doesn't have a fancy smell or fancy packaging
although sometimes i feel like i don't even need to moisturize after this
i'll admit i'm a makeup skin care junkie
i can hands down say this is liquid magic!
makeup goes on way smoother now, oh and not oily!
i am 54 yet still get the occasional acne flare-up
it's not sticky or greasy
this liquid combined with the ceramidin cream are the only creams i have encountered that do not cause irritation burning or breakouts --- true skin saver
it's my day cream nowadays
i like the liquid because i can use 4-5 drops on my face
it boots their moisture power when it isn't quite enough
the thing i like about this liquid is that it isn't sticky or slick
it doesn't have a bad smell which is a plus
this stuff is liquid gold
let me start out that you must use the smallest amount because it can get pretty sticky
this serum works well enough that i don't feel the need to use the ceramidin cream with it
it smells a bit like medicine
it's a thick liquid that leaves your skin feeling a bit tacky which i actually love
it's light enough to use on your body or your face
my only real complaint is the fragrance -- if you has scent sensitivities
you'll need to follow up with a moisturizer
the first thing i noticed about this serum is that it's very liquidy- almost like water
it didn't mesh well with my makeup
i don't care for the cream as it's a bit too heavy for me
i don't even need to wear foundation or tinted moisturizer anymore
i like the fact that it is liquid
does not feel heavy orgreaser
and the anti aging never hurts either!
it's not too greasy
i don't wear any foundation
after you do that it doesn't dispense correctly
this cream has not irritated my face
i guess we'll see about the age arrest anti-wrinkle part of the cream
i found i don't get any irritation whatsoever
i wont by them if they contain parabens
this seemed to even out the color
all you need it a half pea size amount to lather across your whole face
it's not a makeup removing cleanser though
plus it didn't leave my skin tight and flaky!
it's made my skin look
doesn't leave it feeling tight
i only use a pea size amount as it lathers really really well
it doesn't irritate my skin whatsoever
it foams great and doesn't burn my eyes.
i can't stop patting my face afterwards.
this cleans all my makeup off easily without irritating my skin
i usually don't even bother trying new things because my skin is so so picky
my skin is the oiliest skin you can find
sometimes have minor breakouts due to some of the sunscreen not being removed entirely
the rice enzyme powder thing by tatcha were the only things that didn't break me out
this face wash makes me want to want my face over
if you wear heavy amounts of make up
this thing lathers like crazy
i always follow washing my face with moisturizer anyway
i didn't want to go back to the blue line of skincare products since my face didn't feel as oily as it used to be
i'll only notice if i don't use any moisturizer afterwards
doesn't give a squeaky clean feel
the downside is it does feel like it leaves a thin film on your skin right when you wash it
it doesn't leave my skin feeling stripped
i even notice the difference now when i don't use it to cleanse my face
gentle enough on your face
it's left feeling smooth
i like that there's no fragrance because i have sensitive skin
i like that i am not using benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid on my skin everyday anymore
really foams up with a little water
usually i don't even use face cleanser
i tried it because it is supposed to be gentle
i can't say that it really cleaned up any of my skin issues or moisturized at all
this cleanser has seemed to fix all of my skin woes
did not leave my skin red or irritated
you don't need a lot because it spreads out easily
is enough to wash your face with.
i do use a cleansing oil to take off my long wearing makeup
it's nothing a good moisturizer can't balance back out
it lasts forever because you can use literally such a tiny amount
but this one really works for my oily skin.
so i always rinse if off on time.
which only irritate my skin
i rarely see a surprise pimple or get the "rash-like" acne all over like i was getting
be careful it will burn if u get it in your eyes
simply it's a miracle in a jar
i just use a very small amount which is enough for making rich lather
especially didn't irritate it
while it's not a great makeup remover
the reasoning i'm giving it 4 stars is because it doesn't help with my acne like other face washes have
not sure about it's effectiveness with helping clear up my skin when i have occasional zits
it's not greasy at all
it doesn't sit on top of your face
you don't have to use much product for one wash
only down fall u will need boscia blotting papers because it will make ur skin a little oily small price to pay for flawless younger looking skin
however it doesn't take off eye makeup or makeup well
i must say that it is great to have a cleanser that doesn't make your face feel tight or peel
returned it not wanting to risk it with the scent however i then bought the first aid beauty gentle milk cleanser or whatever it's called
if you're in your mid-twenties
it doesn't leave a greasy finish
i don't wear makeup
good for sensitive skin when you think you'd tend to break out
it also doesn't make my skin greasy which is a huge perk to me
i would say if you're using a lot of acne treatments that dry out your skin
for my skin type
it's thick, but it didn't make me break out!
i also love that it doesn't stink like most sensitive lotions do
some people say it's a little oily.
i feel this oily is not making you feel truly oily
this, you still feel your skin can breath.
the smell doesn't linger
this stuff is my jam!!!
this moisturizer does it's job
there's nothing wrong with smelling clean
i can't use those drying products anymore
because i have occasional acne
no, it's not too heavy for daily use.
i do tend to switch
i switch to the lotion version as it can be tad heavy for summer
i love to switch things up often
there's a learning curve as to how much to use during the day if you have oily skin
it took me some time to figure out the correct amount to use during the day so that it doesn't feel too heavy or look greasy under my makeup
yes if your over do it it can feel sticky
that is the beauty of this product you only need a couple dabs
there's a clear difference in the texture
it's rich without being heavy
i sometimes get a little oily if i wear it during the day for long hours
doesn't feel heavy on your face
it doe not make my face feel greasy at all.
it does not leave you looking/feeling oily though
perfect if you want to use this underneath your make up
it's such a great moisturizer for those with young adult skin
it's rich enough but does not clog pores.
flaky in some spots which drives me super crazy cause i can't find a product that will moisturize my skin
take care of the flaky patches without being greasy everywhere else
like not thick feeling at all
i tried everything to get rid of my acne
i don't have to use any acne treatments anymore
i don't mind the smell
it helps me combat the flakiness i sometimes get from the retinol
in the winter it's mostly my t-zone that's oily
it's a big bonus that there are not sulfates nor phthalates in the ingredients
you only need so little to moisture your entire face
oily so most cause me to break out
it even comes with a little spatula
was not at all greasy
it made my face so so so oily.
since it's enriched/thicker it would not leave my face oily
i would definitely recommend this product if you have acne prone skin
wouldn't recommend it if you're using a really harsh topical medicine
i wouldn't say it's lightweight
it doesn't feel too heavy either
it seems like it would be thick or heavy when you first touch it
with occasional breakouts i'd end with dark spots that i hated very much
it does what it says without the oily feeling in the morning
my makeup goes on smoother, i swear.
it's not at all greasy or heavy
the consistency is actually thick which i like
not at all greasy
this moisturizer doesn't do all that it says it will
i like how it just absorbs in to your skin
doesn't really feel greasy or heavy
my makeup goes on so smooth
my face was so flaky that i wasn't able to apply make-up smoothly
it's intense too -- really moisturizes my face.
it doesn't leave your face oily
i think it's too heavy for day
this product isn't necessarily an anti-aging cream
it's way too rich
it is too thick or feels greasy if you have oily ot combo skin
keeps your face so moisturized:
i rarely have to use extra moisturizer
the packaging is silly.
just don't get it into the eye as it'll sting
there is a sort of funky odor that i didn't notice was so strong when i received a free sample
i'll tell you that the funkiness goes away
don't have a lot of wrinkles yet
don't have too many comments on the effects of wrinkles/fine lines/crow's feet
i can't say that it helped with dark circles onder my eyes
why don't you have any wrinkles around your eyes"?
not actually fix the wrinkles
so while i think it's probably a fine eye cream
i can't say it diminished darkness
does not ever get too thick or cause milia
a lot of eye creams unfortunately break me out
the only negative i have is that it doesn't really make a dent in any sort of puffiness under my eyes
on days when i don't want to wear make up i am not needing to cover my dark circles with concealer because they look nothing like before
serums do not provide me with enough moisture.
i don't have extreme wrinkles
you know you've found your holy grail product when you no longer check the reviews for other br
this cleanser makes my face feel like a baby's bum
do not get too close to the bottom lashline as it's very rich
this eye cream does it all.
i can't say anything about puffiness
because my eyes don't get very puffy
i love that it's an orbital eye cream
can't have too many peptides
i tend to have dark circles under my eyes
i think i may be allergic to something in this
i didn't feel any tingles
this eye cream does it all
i almost feel that by adding this as my day serum i almost do'nt need a primer
the flakiness is back too
it's a loose liquid so what's leftover on my fingers i rub on the back of my h
it's so light, sinks into my skin immediately.
noticed that my skin isn't as taut as it used to be
i think the expression lines are always going to be hard to get rid of with a serum unless you commit to having no expressions
not just expression lines
i don't have any wrinkles even in my mid forties
i know theres no claim that it will lighten sunspots
it still seems to disappear too quick
i love the sily twxture without feeling greasy
you only need a small bit to moisturize your whole face
i would imagine it would not work well on oily skin due to the consistency of the cream
i'd like to change the packaging to a squeeze-it-yourself tube or a jar
moisturizers rarely rate more than a yawn from me
not sticky like many other light moisturizers
they were all either too greasy
for anyone that thinks if you have oily skin you can not use oil
i only get a little oily in my t zone during the day so this oil is perfect for me
t doesn't feel greasy
i don't think i'll use this on my entire face since the level of hydration it provides is a bit much for my habitually oily areas
yes it can be oily
all the reviews about the easy-to-spill bottle almost made me not buy this
all you need to do is mist your skin with water
the bottle is so easy to spill
doesn't leave skin shiny
who makes a bottle full of oil so easy to spill???
leaves you with a soft glow that i just can't get enough of
don't have any fine lines
this face oil is not bad.
it does seem a little greasy
doesn't slide off your face like some moisturizers will do
it's annoying as the product gets low
i wouldn't use any other gel like substance
seemed silly to purchase something i couldn’t keep on my face
why there's low stars for this product
it's for use with the nuface device.
it's a little pricey for the amount you get
some of the reviewers seem to be mistaking this product with a primer which i can't even wrap my head around
i didn't find it overpowering or offputting
dull i guess you can say weathered
he skin looks so good i am using it now instead of my overpriced serum
although the roses smell is not my type
the scent doesn't last on the skin
after about 3 weeks use my skin doesn't feel tight or flaky anymore
if you don't like that sensation
i tend to break out really easily
my skin also tends to get pretty oily mid-day
and not in a greasy kind of way.
probably because i'm allergic to one or more of the ingredients
this is the only eye cream that didn't irritate me
it didn't irritate my eyes
this is one of the very few eye creams on the market that don't cause my eyes to water like crazy
assumed it would be just like all other "hyped" eye creams
the crepey-ness under my eyes is practically gone
it does not leave a smooth texture for applying makeup
you might not like this to use to completely remove all of your makeup
my skin doesn't feel tight after using
one thing i will say is that you should apply a moisturizer or oil after using the cleanser because it does tighten up your face a little bit
assuming it was a makeup remover -- i couldn't believe how well it cleaned
it doesn't take all my eyeliner
i've noticed my skin isn't as oily as it used to have a tendency to be as well
it does not strip skin at well
doesn't strip my face of oils
doesn't burn or irritate my eyes.
it doesn't dry my skin out or make it too oily.
my skin doesn't feel right after washing
this cleanser alone doesn't seem to get my skin clean enough
the makeupbreakup is just too oily for me
your skin will love it.
doesn't irritate any acne flair ups i might have
it doesn't cause a soapy buildup with my clarisonic like some cleansers have
provided it's not waterproof
so well i don't even have to use a separate eye makeup remover
i cannot even use fresh
this cleanser gets everything off
i notice a difference in how my skin looks when i switch to another cleanser
you may want to avoid it or just remember to moisturize very
it isn't harsh at all
i don't get a lot of acne
it doesn't really foam up at all
i could see using this a a gentle cleanser in the morning when you have no makeup to remove
i didn't think an oily cleanser would do much
my skin didn't have any redness at all
you have to rub the cleanser onto your skin when it's dry
this doesn't dry out my skin at all it just leaves it feeling nice
i only wear light makeup.
its not as tough on mascara
nothing my eye makeup remover cant get
it's about as tough on makeup as i'd expect from a gel
i think because this doesnt have soap or anthing foaming it just works perfectly with my skin
it doesn't bother my asthma
even though my skin usually throws a rash or some sort of temper tantrum at any excuse
this stuff will take off almost any makeup with no scrubbing
at home i will probably use a heftier waterproof eye makeup remover on my eyes on heavy makeup days
i feel like it moisturizes enough that it doesn't strip my face
in fact, it's my fave cleanser of all time.
does not foam at all
it takes off eye makeup doesn't sting!
i can't speak to how well it works as a makeup remover
it doesn't foam at all.
it's definitely not for removing makeup in my opinion
it even gets off my mascara
i can't say how it is with waterproof mascara because i don't wear waterproof
that's enough to spread all over
it does not foam up
it's not a greasy oily feel either
it doesn't irritate my eyes.
i would not recommend using this the same way as other cleansing oils by using it on totally dry skin to remove your makeup--as i see others have tried to use it
i don't mind the fragrance at all, though.
melts makeup away like nothing else i've tried
it does not have a lot of lather
to me that's a good sign as a lot of lather can strip moisture from your skin
although nothing can yet beat lancome bi-facil for removing eye makeup
if you don't you will lose lashes which isn't pretty
i still have that small mascara undereye smudge that i only have to do a quick wipe-over with lancome
it doesn't feel like it's cleaning very much
i do use makeup wipes to take off my makeup because i don't like the makeup all over my h
my skin doesn't feel stripped
don't really expect it to get rid of all my makeup
haven't really seen a facial cleanser that can do all of that
doesn't leave my skin feeling tight or stripped
i don't think it has dried my skin out or gave it any extra unnecessary oil
but melts everything else!
i don't use it on my eyes
it doesn't smell too strong or gross
i don't end up with a black area around my eyes or feel any stinging like i would with the oil makeup remover
it's not so dry that i'll get flakes or feel uncomfortable
it doesn't hydrate like it says it does
doesn't leave my skin feeling tight
can feel quite sticky on the face
this mask is light enough you can sleep in it
t's hard to find products that work that don't flare up my condition
at the same time not irritate your skin
i can't use it every night because i am afraid it will clog my pores
it also does not clog my pores which i find many night masks
i replaced a really expensive jar of night mask with this
it's not a build-able moisturizer
it does make your skin a bit sticky when you first apply it
sometimes it even heals pores on my face.
i do not rinse off in the morning
not at all irritating either.
think it helps keep my face free from pimples
can get flaky if i don't moisturize
can get oily if i put in my t-zone areas
love that it's a squeeze bottle
it's more like a deep moisturizer than a mask.
this is the only moisturizer i own that fully moisturizes my skin- i can really feel it sink in instead of sitting on top of my skin
especially if you're a side sleeper
the fact that you don't need to wash it off is a plus in my books
it doesn't make my skin feel sticky
when i do not moisturize my face enough i get very oily
it's not sticky and does not irritate my skin.
i sometimes mix it into my day cream if it's super cold outside
is when you apply it there is a heavy flowery smell
usually somewhat flakey by the end of the day if i don't use the right products
my face itches so bad
it doesn't feel irritated or uncomfortable
it's made my face stick to the pillow
they're not super pricey, a great buy.
it doesn't smear all over my pillow
rinsing in the morning it doesn't feel slippery slimy like some products
makes me look like i slept 8+ hours which i usually don't get anymore with a new baby
it is not grease
don't worry about sticking to the pillow
this smell is not irritating at all.
i will use it after my moisturizer if my skin is really needing some extra tlc or just use it as a night cream
it doesn't irritate or provoke any redness for me — in fact
i wouldn't recommend for break-out prone or oily skin types
it's made without a bunch of nasty preservatives
another bonus to that is that it doesn't make my hair around my face greasy
maybe suggesting to oily people that they don't apply to their super oily areas until they know how their skin will react
it calms my skin when it's irritated.
it does smell of roses, but it's not bad.
especially since it doesn't have bad chemicals in it
it feel so lightweight that i don't think it's appropriate to call it a "mask"
this mask doesn't cause any breakouts for me at all
maybe a tad greasy for me
it's worth a try if you don't have an hg moisture mask yet
my cleanser doesn't leave my skin as tight
it doesn't feel heavy at all
all the comments that say it makes your skin dewey
i don't have any issues with my pillow getting greasy
although it's getting oilier
even my makeup applies
if you are on the oilier side
i am not usually a huge fan of masks.
the creme seems like it just sits on my skin
flaky no matter what
i literally have never used a product that has almost instantly changed the texture of my skin until i slathered this on
it just gives your skin that extra oompf
wouldn't suggest wearing it under makeup
it stays a little "tacky" on my skin for quite a while after applying
it's thick but not heavy or greasy on the skin.
this is definitely not a product for people with oily skin
this is the only moisturizer i have ever used that gives enough hydration without breaking me out
when i try anti-aging products they are usually thick
doesn't cause break outs
it doesn't leave that much of a greasy residue
don't recommend using it in the morning because it does make my skin just a little oily
my skin is super extra oily yet when i put this on
have to be careful that whatever cream i use isn't too greasy or heavy
it don't use it every night because i don't want my skin to get accustomed to the anti-aging cremes at this point
i don't feel greasy from the cream
or you think it might leave you greasy
even if i don't put moisturizer on in the morning
i love how this masks feels as you wash it off
when i'm not using this one i use algenist genius gel
i don't usually wear foundation.
enough to get me hooked on this moisturizer
all i know is they're mostly gone
it is still a little bumpy looking if i use the wrong concealer/primer
had no bad reactions like i usually get
even concealer doesn't help.
not sure if age, stress or lack of sleep.
i feel that my makeup does not crease as it would with the heavier eye creams i've used
i frequently suffer from insomnia so the dark circles were pretty bad
it's my new go to
i will say though i do need concealer still for the puffiness i get sometimes under my eyes
it's probably too rich for oily skin
i don't need to wear concealer as often.
if you're sleeping well
this doesn't make my face greasy or break out
it makes my face so smooth, not greasy at all.
i don't have to rub it in
i tend to use as a night cream.
i find my face looks less shiny with this product than with most moisturizers i've tried which is a plus
which can be really oily
not greasy at all.
i do not get as oily in the morning as i used to
it's not too greasy
does not clog my pores
although it looks like a cream
it's horrible on skin
it doesn't smell strongly
not at all greasy
it doesn't feel heavy
it's for use at day
mattifies without making my skin look dull
foundation which normally with any other oil free moisturizer it would leave me shiny
once i tried the algenist genius cream + the smashbox pore minimizer primer its like a whole new world for my makeup routine
my t zone can get a little oily
it's not strictly a night cream
even superficial upon waking
it is such a cute little container
not your typical coconut scent
i get greasy in the matter of hours
oils before that i either had bad reactions to
my skin does not look greasy nor oily when i wake up
everybody's skin is different
if you don't like tight feeling on your skin you won't like this
'm only 20 so my wrinkles aren't severe
this moisturizer does not live my skin wanting more hydration
best of all i don't look oily even after a long day at work
this doesn't give me a rash
by the way my skin tends to be oily if i use the wrong items however this keeps my skin soft
can't recommend this cream enough!
it doesn't make me any oilier
doesn't bother my over sensitive eyes
it isn't heavy feeling
in fact it's almost a whipped texture
it's hard to find a product that can provide adequate moisture without making my skin feel greasy
irritating it or just causing a breakout
as i can't go spending this much on a moisturizer every other month
the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because i use the algenist tinted moisturizer
it doesn't hurt that it smells like chocolate chip cookies either
but, it never leaves me feeling greasy or oily.
i don't mind the smell as long as the product isn't sticky like a cinnabon
after 5-10 minutes of wearing it i don't even notice a smell
it feels unlike any of the other creams i've tried
i've sometimes put it on after something else irritates my face
it's still too early to tell how this cream rates as an anti-aging cream
i'd love to try the eye cream too
i find it doesn't irritate my eye area at all
this moisturizer doesn't make that worse
i don't use it in the morning unless i'm housebound for the day as it tends to make me look like a grease ball within a few hours
i wasn't sure how that would be seeing that i have normal to oily skin
if you've just started feeling the effects of being a woman "of a certain age
it's not a heavy smell.
i can't believe i finally found a wrinkle cream that actually works
i don't tend to get breakouts
does not go on sticky
it does not feel thick
it did not cause any breakouts or leave my skin oily
my makeup goes on easy after applying
not sure i need an expensive face cream habit
it is not a heavy cream
what i love about their eye creams is they don't burn my eyes like many others do
it doesn't give me acne there
this moisturizer is the only one i can use right now because it doesn't give me chin acne
now i can skip the dessert that goes to my hips
oily skin may not like how greasy this can become a few hours in
it doesn't irritate my skin
it's never greasy feeling
i now use what i have left of this as an extra layer of moisturizer over everything on nights i feel i need more hydration
going to try the genius eye cream
only thing i don't like about algenist genius cream is the strong lingering fragrance
too bad it's not fragrance-free.
must say that every am my skin glows
don't have a ton of wrinkles
as soon as i peel it off it brings all the gross stuff in my pimples to pop
hurts too peel off
it is easy to peel off
despite the strength of this mask it does not irritate my skin
meaning you don't get many uses out of the bottle
i didn't notice a big change in my skin texture
is acne-prone i've been wanting to do masks
it doesn't make my face break out
really do takes all the blackheads on my nose
i recommend this product to anyone who doesn't want any oily skin or apparent blackhead on your face
it does get rid of my pores
though i would definitely recommend using a thicker layer
most masks either don't get enough out or strip the skin way too dry
when i peel it off i can actually see all the gunk it took with it
i only gave 4 stars because the mask is difficult to peel if you don't apply a thick enough layer
don't get you all mad trying to peel off it works on the feel of your skin also leaves your skin soft to the touch
it really did shrink my pores
i love that it is a peel off
i put on a too thin layer that made it nearly impossible to peel off
it was easy to peel off
if you want a mask that controls your oil
it's really easy to peel.
i only use peel-off masks because they aren't messy
this mask made it so that i no longer feel the blackheads whenever i feel around my nose with my finger
clean out your pores so whatever treatment or serum you put on afterwards is able to soak in
i recommend it if you wear a lot of make up or if you have acne or oily prone skin
it's usually pretty clear
what i love about this one is that it's a peel-off
the only problem is that it's kind of tricky to get the mask off
i may have put the mask on too thin though
because it didn't peel off in one piece like in the video
you can actually see the impurities coming out of your skin
it kinda hurts to peel it off in the winter
you can actually see the junk from your pores when peel it off
my face is also not as oily as it was before
it's easy to spread on
this is a super easy-to-use peel-off mask.
not crazy… when i peel it off
i don't usually apply anything after this mask
i would not recommend this for anyone other than oily skin
i didn't experience any burning or stinging.
it doesn't make my sensitive skin irritated which for me is a miracle
it peels off pretty easily
so if you want a deep clean, slab it on.
it gets really deep into your pores
when you peel it
it's super-easy to use
it's kind of like a pore strip for your entire face
find it picky to get off either way
it doesn't strip my skin
i don't actually use a mask in my routine now
this could easily replace a facial so $30 seems cheap all of a sudden
it doesn't clog my pores or do anything to my super sensitive skin
it's gentle, yet able to pull out blackheads.
it was super easy to peel off
my mask did not peel of near as well as the video
because i have oily skin it doesn't pull out black heads like i though
maybe peel off masks just aren't for me
i could not get the bloody thing to peel
washed it off like i normally do
this takes care of the extra oils in my t-zone
it's not messy at all
it's also quite easy to peel off
i also like the hint of red color so you can see what you are peeling off vs
my skin is pretty "normal" i don't really get oily nor do i get dry
otherwise it came off easy
my skintone was so even
it's not harsh on skin at all.
it's hard to find a cleanser that can actually remove long wear make up without being too harsh on the skin
when i wake up in the morning im usually very oily
today is wasnt even half as oily like it normally is
i've literally tried every face wash you can think of
my pores actually seem to shrink after every use
it's very hard to work up a lather.
although it does smell a lot like the regular cleanser
i often get little bumps on my cheeks
not squeaky clean like my face hurts when i smile or raise my eyebrows
does not get oily throughout the day
get a good lather going
otherwise you will clog your pores
i don't use it every day as my skin gets dried out very easily
this is my go to for the occasional bad pimple i get
i like this cleanser it takes off all of my makeup
most cleaners either do not clean my face enough our clean so harsh my face is dried out
normal soap wouldn't get the smell off
skin would still be greasy
this stuff is so gentle it doesn't leave me irritated at all
it's a lot like the mask
love this product my face has never been clear i have oily skin
i did notice that it helps clean out my pores
as fab products usually do
which i think is a bit gimmicky
it cleans but doesn't leave my skin tight.
realized it's a cleanser not a mask
if you're not super strict with your face regime don't worry- i only remember to wash my face 5-6 days a week
it doesn't feel as though a residue is left on your skin after use
it's definitely helped reduced the blackheads on my nose
i love it, it's a very deep cleanser.
i usually don't believe claims for cleansers since it washes right off
my face does tend to feel a bit tight after washing with this
sometimes i don't even have to blot at all which is a miracle for my skin
doesn't irritate my skin.
doesn't feel harsh at all
doesn't leave my skin feeling stripped like some cleansers do
this mask doesn't make my face oily
t has time to dry or else my pillow will be orange
:(not too fond of the smell either!
the pump/top doesn't completely rise sometimes
don't overuse this product i have no problems
it is not overpowering
i really don't care for the packaging of this product
t doesn't rub off onto pillows
the tint does not come off on your skin
does not feel tacky
just want your skin to glow in general you need this mask
my one complaint is that i can't sleep with this ''sleeping'' mask
if you are at all acne prone
the only thing i'm not crazy about is that since it's so thick
that i don't like using it overnight since it still feels a bit sticky
don't use it everyday
love it because it sits on your skin while you sleep it's almost like medicine working its magic
doesn't break me out, and it lasts forever.
help even out your skin tone
i normally don't like wearing sleeping masks.
this is a must have for my dark skin tone.
yes it's a bit pricey
i don't think anything takes the wrinkles away
i don't like the smell
does not leave residue on pillow or sheets.
it's a decent sized bottle with a thick consistency formula that won't drip into your eyes or mouth like most facial oils so that's a huge plus
t doesn't leave slime on my pillow or in my hair
sometimes i leave on certain "problem spots" while i sleep
any time i get a pimple
i can't speak to the lightening of my acne scars since i have not been using the product long enough
the cream does have a tendency to pill off of your face
sometimes, they never fade!
you must use a good spf every day if you are trying to get rid of spots
it's great: it has no smell
helps with elasticity it spreads very well under the eyes so you don't have to rub at all
not as greasy as shiseido
that one doesn't compare to the black tea eye cream
this eye cream does wonders
i've tried a whole bunch of other eye creams
love the consistency as it's on the thicker side
i normally am not a fan of fresh products
didn't irritate my eyes or the surrounding skin
i dont know if this will work for people who already have wrinkly eyes
not using this to get rid of wrinkles cuz i dont have any
it may not be hydrating enough for the over 45+ crowd
it's like magic in a bottle.
it seems like my smile-wrinkles don't look as harsh
can wear it under makeup
i don't think this reduces any fine lines
it will not remove your fine lines
it didn't seem to solve the puffiness or dark circle issue that i often have
i deducted one star simply because the price is a bit silly for a small jar
i don't notice a smell
eye makeup removers so this line is a blessing
it's no longer dark
wrinkles too which makes it a+++ in my book
doesn't bother my eyes
it's just the right texture.
even though it's pricey
it didn't remove my dark under circles
it's been a struggle with my eyes
this cream did not mess up any under eye makeup application like most eye creams tend to do
it doesn't help the bags under my eyes
lack of sleep than anything
the effects last even on days when i'm lazy
it's not so thick that you feel it on
kinda a let down when it's that expensive.
my bf can usually tell the night after whenever i used this cream
when i don't use it, the compliments disappear.
...so you see it's for all ages.
i usually put something over it though because my 32 year old skin is very "thirsty" after 30 years of being an oily mess
it did leave a bit of a gloss
normally i just blot
my spots are not as dark
if it works for you then you save yourself the money of a dermatologist appointment
if there's ever been anyone who's fastidious about products feeling oily
you really need only 2 drops to cover your face
i don't quite love the price or the dropper
usually if it's something greasy
it does feel like you're putting oil on you skin at night before bed
if you're worried about it being "too oily" or causing you to break out
i wasn't too oily
a drop of anything to my face will give me a big zit almost instantly
no zits even though i'm using a product with oil
it did not make my skin any more oily
the products inside don't seem unvegan to my knowledge
doesn't reach into the bottle enough to properly dispense enough of the milk every time
keeps the flakey patches away without weighing my skin down or going on super thick
it wastes a lot of product which is annoying because it's not a cheap product
doesn't leave you looking greasy
like anyone with a certain madness for makeup
it didn't feel sticky or too oily.
so maybe that's why people are having issues with it not being creamy
shouldn't be that expensive for a tiny little bottle truthfully
it's really glowing and not at all greasy!
i only use it at night because i do find it feels a little tacky on the skin
would not recommend for those who have oily skin though
softens, but not as greasy as the pure oil ~
it's my go to right out of the shower
this stuff is literally a miracle in the bottle
gives you that little extra you need for dry skin without feeling greasy
there's tons of product in the container also.
it does make your skin brighter
--basically the packaging sucks
i can mix this into my moisturizer or even my foundation
it does not leave your skin oily as it absorbs quickly
this product does not clog pores
i love to use this under makeup to make my skin look extra dewy
it's great since i hate using or finding lotion for my face
use sparingly or youll end up looking greasy
i'd say if you have oily skin
not sticky or tacky
it is smooth like velvet, and i am not kidding!
it is not greasy
didn't bother my sensitive skin at all
the dropper barely lets me get anything out
it may be too much for someone with oily skin
find it to be too oily for my combo skin
my skin doesn't feel like it's cracking anymore.
there's barely any scent
unlike other oils it doesn't make it so my makeup comes off easily or slides around
it isn't heavy at all.
you have to let it sit on your skin
absorb otherwise it'll get to greasy
i like this mask but it's way too overpriced.
i sometimes use this in place of my normal moisturizer
i think it has gotten less oily because of my new routine
my skin didn't seem to need any face cream after i use this
my t-zone not overly oily
now that it's spring
it does not cause blemishes
what more is it supposed to do than hydrate your skin?
the smell is so good sometimes i forgot it's not edible lol
usually i use my towel to wash off this mask because i always put a very thick layer of this mask on my face which is very time consuming to take off without towel
it's more like a moisturizer than a mask
i don't even rinse it off!
i know it's pricy
usually when i use very hydrating products they tend to make my t zone a little oily in the morning
think it's good for strategic use if you have oily skin
it's got a little weird residue
it's usually all absorbed by then
doesn't look too greasy wearing "in public" on a plane
it's super hydrating if you wash it off after ten minutes
doesn't feel heavy or clog your pours if you leave it on over night
only downside it's really pricey
i like that it doesn't feel sticky like other masques
you need to try this mask
how quickly things can go wrong when masks mess with my skin's moisture
i still gotta cleanse
as long as you are cleansing your skin properly you should not break out
if it's hot or i over moisturize
it gets super oily to the point that any makeup just slicks right off
doesn't leave me feeling greasy
my skin doesn't get super oily throughout the day
as my normal routine wasn't doing anything to help moisturize my skin
it does have a little tingle when you first apply it
love the fact you don't need to wash it of cause your skin absorbs all the moisture
you don't even need to wash it off because your skin just absorbs the moisture
this product didn't irritate my skin at all.
i do prefer massaging it in afterwards so that i can forego a moisturizer
i usually use in the shower
this is an interesting mask because it doesn't dry out
it's done wonders to my complexion
so you don't put your fingers in the pot
it's important to remember that sometimes you can cause your skin to over produce oil if you aren't hydrating it
i wouldn't use it every day as my skin can't h
it really sinks into your skin
thats not the only thing it's also super hydrating which i need because my skin gets very dry during the winter
my skin just sucks this up
if you are not a fan of scents
don't wash it off.
it didn't get rid of my uneven texture
this product doesn't irritate it at all
i live where it's usually hot all year long
i really do hate tacky formulas for my face
as i don't ever wipe it off
she's as happy as the proverbial clam
cream is not too light weight or heavy it just so good on my skin
my face actually gets oily with it
love everything about it except that i found it too thick
doesn't make my face feel oily
after one use, my skin was no longer flaky.
my skin drinks this stuff
it leaves no greasy residue or shine like most "rich" formulas
this cream is so moisturing
i wasn't sure about this because a lot of heavy creams make me break out
i like the smell too.
it's very clean and not at all cloying.
i can't stop touching my face after i apply!
"i'm super paranoid about everything breaking me out
don't rub this in or you'll have troubles if used over other products
the only con is that it can make my eyes water
it wasn't doing anything to help keep the dryness at bay since i started using retin a
a tiny amount goes a long way - it's thick stuff.
it's hard for me to "settle down" with any one bran for product
i would find this to be too heavy to be a morning moisturizer
it's a little jar of miracles.
you just really only need a couple dabs between your fingers
it really does get flakey if you rub your skin
the original cream didn't eliminate the flakiness on my nose
unless i see crazy anti-aging results
it's not too heavy
the texture is just a bit too thick for me
i don't have many wrinkles
my skin looks even
my skin looks even
i don't smell tobacco or anything off putting.
doesn't pill for me
doesn't give me a white cast
t's really tough to find sunscreen that won't irritate my eyes
on days that i don't i generally will use a color corrector
i prefer this cleansing oil as it does not leave my pores congested like the balm version
it doesn't bother my concealer
i do wear it over clinique all about eyes
doesn't leave a white cast that i've noticed
blend it out well if you aren't going to put on makeup afterward
doesn't sting my eyes at all
i believe i've tried every undereye cream out there as i have dark circles
i even get moon burn.
it doesn't drip into my eyes, or sting.
it hasn't made my eyes water or sting yet
does not make my skin oily
this stuff is the only spf that won't burn badly
of course you don't wanna squeeze it into your eyeball
stings a little if it gets in your eye
then it doesn't sting
but when applied under makeup you can't tell.
it's fairly rare to find an eye cream with spf [i'm guessing because spf usually stings the eyes?]
it doesn't sting or burn my eyes
it doesn't interfere with my eye makeup or under-eye concealer
i can always use another eye cream underneath
so i can't always wear sunglasses.
it's been around for a while
no eye sting or burning no matter how much i sweat
it's pricy but it's so good
removes all makeup on my face when i am lazy to wash my face
it's the only one i've tried that doesn't leave my face feeling sticky
i don't wear heavy makeup
powerful enough to remove yucky stuff off eyes
i even use it as a cleanser when i'm too lazy to wash my face at night
it doesn't irritate my skin
or bother my eyes
get all the crud off my face
the oil really does dissolve all the make up
sometimes i just cleanse my face with this
since i wear a lot of makeup
f you're sensitive to scents it'll dissipate in a few seconds
i tend to have combination skin that's acne-prone
when there's no time to wash thoroughly
for those of you out there who don't like toners
doesn't leave your skin with that tight feeling
doesn't hurt your eyes
it's not as bad as other cleansers though
i prefer this combination as the make-up forever doesn't sting my eyes at all
it does sting the eyes like crazy though
i love this for mornings when i don't want to use a regular cleanser
it's very refreshing after washing your face
it's also nice to use in the morning when a foamy cleanser might be too much
it's a great product , melts my makeup right off
really rub it around my eye area which you can do because it doesn't irritate
i love how it melts away my makeup
i never have to scrub my eyes to get all of my mascara
alone cleanser because it doesn't feel like it leaves my skin clean
easy to use-i just rub it all over my face like using face wash in shower
the second thing that matters the most to me is that the formula doesn't ruin your regular nail polish
somehow there's just a nasty film like residue left behind with some
instead i use it to really make sure it's all gone after i've used makeup remover wipes for my face
it doesn't irritate my skin
doesn't make your face feel tight after
i prefer this over than the balm form because it's more hygenic
i love this "cleansing oil" it is actually not an oil
doesn't irritate my skin or eyes
it removes makeup like nothing
doesn't leave a greasy residue or make my eyes greasy
you'll need to rinse a couple times with water
doesn't leave residue behind
the only con is that the makeup doesn't really "dissolve"
you're going to get a fair amount of transfer when you wipe your face after rinsing
does not leave residue
i love that this oil has no smell
boscia makeup breakup oil was so bad
acne prone skin so removing my makeup at the end of the day with a product that won't strip my skin is a must for me
i just prefer the balm
it does burn my eyes a bit
once there is none of this milky residue coming off you will know that your skin will be clear of makeup
so that when you actually wash your face with soap
i really love the fake that it's an oil
does not irritate my oily
i didn't like that i was tugging my skin--especially to remove my eye makeup
even my eye makeup
i find that it's able to remove makeup
this was the first cleansing oil i tried that didn't cause breakouts or leave my skin feeling greasy
i love this make up remover so much
this oil basically dissolves any set-in foundation that otherwise would remain on your skin even with washing
waterproof makeup may need a bit more.
this stuff melts makeup right off of my face in a matter of seconds
not that i like a thick formula
this cleansing oil does not break me out
even though it's oil it doessn't feel greasy or tacky
doesn't require a cloth to remove
it doesn't irritate my eyes or my skin
it just melts your makeup off!
you need this oil in your life
this does an amazing job at taking off all my makeup even waterproof mascara
it really gets off the most stubborn makeup.
t doesn't irritate my skin
rub it in like you would a normal face wash.
it will clean out your pores like no other
definitely recommend over any sort of wipes.
since this isn't made up of "real oils" i decided to give it a try for removing my makeup
i love this product because i think it's easier for me daily routine than the makeup removers
not greasy, removes everything, and no scent!!!!
removed all my makeup easily even if it's waterproof
this stuff takes all your makeup off immediately rven the waterproof madcara
it's my must-have product.
didn't add any greasiness to my skin
what i love most about them are the grits
didn't burn my eyes
when i wear makeup i go all out
not clog my skin
what i find amazing is how it leaves no oily residue unlike some cleansing oils i have tried
this product couldn't be easier to use- just squirt two pumps into the palm of your h
it seems like the opposite of what you would expect from putting literal oil on your face
it does not make my face feel oily or leave any residue on my face
oh and it isn't oily at all.
especially if you're the type to wear waterproof mascara
i know that in general they're real is an incredibly tough mascara to get off with regular makeup remover
this doesn't clog it or make it worse
other make up removers require you to wash more than one to get rid of everything
there wasn't any leftover makeup on the cotton pad so one less product i have to use
i didn't get any clouding in my eyes afterwards
there's complaints that it's greasy
it doesn't sting my eyes at all when removing eye makeup
it takes off all of your makeup
it leaves your skin free of makeup
removes makeup and it's so gentle on face!!!
most primers for pores honestly aren't meant for your whole face
the oil does not leave a residue on my face which is nice
especially if you tend to wear long wear makeup
works well and is not irritating to my eyes.
i really like this makeup remover.
it doesn't dry out my skin or make it oily either
i usually put it where my laugh line is at
doesn't stop the shine completely
not an all-over your face cream
it doesn't feel heavy even when you put on a lot
just like all origins skin care
does seem to blur the imperfections
the concealer doesn't go into my wrinkles because of it
yet my skin looks so smooth
it does have a bit of a scent to it
f you're sensitive to perfume smells this might not be for you
what it is is very moisturizing so may choose to skip your daily moistureizer it's not greasy
i do get just a little oily by the end of the day
even at 37 gets some zits
it doesn't make me look oily even at the end of the day
yes it's pricey for the small tube
i can wear this
'm not a makeup heavy person
this really does blur imperfections.
that blah feel you sometimes have on your face
too bad it's too darn pricey or i'd buy it right now
otherwise it's a miracle-working primer!
doesn't make me oily or make my makeup slide off later
but under foundation, blush, etc.
its a perfect primer my face doesn't get oily unlike other products i've used before
i think it works better for those with oily skin.
i think it does blur imperfections
don't require that their skin looks "perfect" every day
don't know that it actually counts as "lightweight"
does not clog my pores
it's one more cream to put on
not at all greasy
however, blur was different - it didn't peel.
especially since i know it's from the ingredients
they are not too heavy to wear under my makeup
it doesn't make my combination skin break out
the pump can be kind of annoying though.
doesn't weigh down my face or leave a weird residue
also doesn't irritate my sensitive skin or leave any kind of weird residue
it's like a mix of compost
i liked this moisturizer because it didn't make my skin oily
this works really well if you have oily skin
this is a nice light lotion that does not make your face oily
super light and didn't irritate my skin.
it feels like nothings on my face
i wanted a light lotion for daytime use that would sink into the skin easily
i think it's less the lotion
its very hard for me to find a moisturizer that wont make me look oily
yet it keeps your skin glowy
the only major drawback for me is that it isn't hydrating enough
i know it's because of the lotion
i don't like heavy products
let me tell you my skin glows
or on a day when i'm not wearing any makeup.
i like how this lotion feels when it's applied to my face
it does feel like a layer of grease
not so heavy that it makes me super shiny halfway through the day
because fresh products seem to like my skin
it could have some spf
it's too heavy for my skin for daytime use
i chose it because it's one of the moisturizers with a pump which is way more hygienic than a pot
it doesn't feel like it's laying on top of my skin like a lot of other creams i've tried in the past
i just can't wear this under makeup
i love this lightweight moisturiser for everyday use before i put on my makeup
it not only detoxes my skin
the magic of this mask is that it somehow treats everything beautifully without aggravating anything else
even with the tingle it's not irritating to my skin
i don't drink enough water
on days when i don't want to wear makeup
want to let my skin breathe
didn't seem to irritate my mild acne
i've used it 3 days in a row to clear up a really bad allergic reaction/hormonal breakout combo
is that it's in a jar
it is a mask that your skin can tolerate every day because it isn’t irritating
i still get a couple zits every week
since using it i have not had even one hormonal break-out
try it you'll love it!
it's like giving yourself an at-home facial!
because of my skin type
doesn't dry or irritate the skin like other clay masks do
it doesn't strip my skin
the smell is a little medicinal, but not bad.
if i happen to have any pimples
there's a lot in the jar
this is one of the few masks that doesn't leave my face feeling
it's actually quite soothing
everyone's skin is different
hydrating masks aside they don't usually provide the cleansing i like to get from a mask
it's easy to apply and rinse off.
when you put it on it doesn't make your face stiff to an annoying point
it's super easy to take off
i don't use it often
maybe because it doesn't dry out my skin like those did
it feels like mud mask when it's on the skin
doesn't pull your skin
it's easy to move your face around even when it's completely dry
it didn't itch or get super dry at all
the effects don't last super long
i often buy a mask
be sure you moisturize after you use this use tho
i don't use the anti-bac as much anymore since the acne is pretty much gone
its effectiveness absolutely doesn't mean you should skip the sunblock
it never got itchy or overdried.
the most amazing part is that my skin doesn't feel dry
did i mention it super easy to rinse off
i like the smell of the product which for some might be weird since a lot of perricone products have that fishy smell to them
its not uncomfortable to the point you want to take it off after 5 minutes like glam glow
always trying to pop my blackheads
the little beads kind of stick to your pores when you wash it off- like you can see where it is pulling the gunk out
it doesn't stay on top of the skin to make it shiny
i also don't find it to be super smelly.
the only down side is that it leaves my combination skin looking a little shiny
after applying it is amazing because it does not leave a white ish residue on my face like most spf moisturizers do
i rarely used facial spf simply because every product i've tried thus far -- cheap to ridiculous -- always breaks me out
it's not super thick
it smells like a bag full of oranges :3 also really helps with any discolourations you may have
the only negative thing i can say is that i have very oily skin
it doesn't look oily or shine -- it just feels a little oily until your skin absorbs it fully
my skin goes dull
does wonders on my skin
it doesn't leave a white cast on my dark skin.
makes my skin not at all dull
therefore i would suggest letting it really sink into your skin before putting on foundation or concealer over top of it
it is not too oily
doesn't make my skin feel oily
i can't say it makes my skin "brighter
i needed something that won't be greasy
it can't be worn under makeup
use only on the days i don't wear makeup
it's a must for me to look remotely awake.
it's hard to find one that is oil-free
this doesn't make your face oily or dry
although i don't care to brighten my skin
doesn't cause break outs
actually leaves my face matte for the day
it doesn't make me look oily
doesn't leave me feeling oily
avoided spf because of that greasy feel until i found bbn
it didn't make my face break out or get super oily by noon
is not too greasy
it doesn't burn or make me red
it's light n it doesn't make my face feel greasy
it doesn't leave a greasy shine
this doesn't have a scent or otherwise look manly except for the "for men" declaration
if i have a blemish i just spot treat it with this stuff
the dropper is hard to get product from
we'll see if this joins my daily routine.
when i do wear it with makeup
let's put it this way
it does not irritate my skin
that's only because i don't want to dilute the pigment of my cc cream or foundation
i even like the smell
lightly hides my under eye circles for when i don't want to wear make up
works really well on its own or under concealer if you want just a touch more coverage
not only does it get rid of fine lines
i couldn't find that in any other eye cream
this cream does all that!
it also hides the dark circles i sometimes get from a lack of sleep
this should be a for sure summer staple in everyone's makeup bag
i can tell a difference in my concealer when i skip this step
it's not a life-altering
i've had issues with so many under eye concealers either not blending well or blending so well that it doesn't correct my under eye circles
it doesn't irritate my skin at all
it's pretty light in coverage
tends to leak into the cap once it's used which sucks considering how much it costs
actually covers my eyes
doesn't look super heavy or like i'm a raccoon
my only gripe is that any pressure on the tube makes a mess all inside the lid thus wasting some of the product unles i can dig it out
i rarely have to wear concealer under my eyes anymore after applying this product in the morning
this doesn't irritate or dry out my eyes
i can wear makeup over too which i love.
can apply a little concealer over without making me look older
doesn't rub or pill when i place product over it
it's so great in fact that i've been able to skip under eye concealer some days
i wear it everyday day
not a wonder under eye cream
but this isn't heavy duty stuff for that.
if your icebox isn't close, it's just a pain.
wears it alone without any other tint or makeup over it
i wear it every time i wear makeup
it's more like a cover up.
couldn't wear makeup for a while
this could even replace concealer for those of you who have mild dark circles because it really does cover well
this stuff is like a treat for your under eyes!
feels ah-mazing rolling the cool metal tip under your eyes after a particularly rough night's sleep
i never wear concealer anymore
this is just my natural skin issue nothing to do with sleep
i usually use this when i wear "no makeup" which is literally just this under my eyes
it's always in my bag wherever i go.
t cancels out circles pretty well on its own without a color corrector
i mean really reduce puffiness
it's better than any concealer i've used
don't want to look like a zombie ghostface either
i rarely wear concealer since i started using this
i especially love that it doesn't set in fine lines under the eyes like most concealers
the product is so good i sometimes don't even put concealer over it
i wasn't sure how a "pink" eye cream would work
i like the texture and it's very smooth to apply.
especially if i dont get a full nights sleep
i can wear it under makeup or on a no makeup day as well
it brightens my eyes so much that i don't always need concealer
i don't typically wear foundation
nothing heavy so your under-eye concealer
you may not even need your concealer when using this
it loses a star because you do need to set it if wearing with makeup or you'll have a creasey mess
wonderful coverage that counteracts dark circles- which i have used on other reddened areas on my face- it's that good
this stuff fixes everything
some days i don't even use a concealer i just dot some product under my eyes
i don't find the consistency thick nor does it cake on my under eye area
it will forever be a holy grail product that's always on my makeup table
i would not use it for under my makeup because it does have a sheen
feels a little wrong to rub the undereye area to apply it
my only worry is that it's such a small size
even when i'm wearing no makeup
i don't find this creases at all
i don't have super dark under eye circles
the combo can't be beat
tightening mask that doesn't dry skin this is a good bet
can't use it all over
literally every "detox" mask sucks the life out of your skin
tightening while it's on
i do us the boscia konjac sponge to take it off it's easier that way
what i like about it is the instant hydration that i feel when applying it
it's your all in one.
it's the cleaning aspect of this that i like
oiliness in my t-zone is pretty much gone!
which tends to look dull every so often from sleep deprivation
this is a great mask for a multitude of issues whether it's exfoliation
smooth not like other mask i tried
great for people that don't want the chemical peel type masks
leaves your skin with a luminosity i can't explain
drawing any nasty stuff out of your clogged pores
it's not as expensive as some masks that do less
my blackheads are basically non-existent
doesn't leave a residue that "pills" when applying products on top of it
i don't use as much moisturizer when mixing it with this product
it's like a drink of water for my face.
doesn't cause any breakouts
it's like some magical potion that heals the dryness right away that no moisturiser could do the job half as well
it's just soooooo expensive though
my skin actually feels like it's holding moisture
it's no longer peeling and is not oily at all.
sometimes flaky skin loves this
etc without getting irritated
not only does it moisturize in seconds
when my skin will get usually oilier
it doesn't cause any clogged pores or breakouts
it's done wonders for my skin
this hydration booster is ideal in the summer because it does not add any oil or shine to my face
make my makeup feel like it might slide off if i do something dumb like rest my chin on my h
it's too light for nighttime use
it's only used to create foam on your h
does not lather a lot
as a makeup remover it's amazing
also doesn't strip your skin of oils or cause irritation
not only does it remove stubborn waterproof makeup i don't need to wash my face because of the oily residue that's left after using most cream removers
i don't see my large pores anymore
because it doesn't irritate my skin in any way
so even though i do get an oily t-zone
while i don't feel like it removes all of my makeup
does not linger on the skin
the fragrance also does not irritate my skin
this is basically just a non-oil-based balm cleanser that you take off with a hot washcloth
does not irritate the eyes
i love how smooth it makes your face.
not tight like some other cleansers do
this takes off all my makeup without irritating.
i don't have to use an eyemakeup remover anymore.
my favorite part is that it's so gentle you can open your eyes while using
not a big deal as i have other washcloths.
plain old stinky noxema has always been my daily go-to because it doesn't dry me out
i didn't wear makeups
i felt the "hot cloth" they included was pretty useless as it is teeny tiny
i even used it to remove my eye makeup
i wear a lot of makeup
it does get sticky
when put in the fridge before use it makes for such a cool
it doesn't dehydrate me
some old acne spots seem to be less red
they're nothing like this one
i can't see my skin surviving without it
i can't attest to it's "sciency" claims of the benefits of plant stem cells--i attri
while i sometimes use it on it's own
if you keep your skin fed
stop scrubbing it so much
i do not find it hydrating in the slightest
which may be annoying to some
it's not overpowering for me
plus, there's so much in this jar!
i also love how it doesn't make my face dry
nor too sticky that it comes off on my pillow as i have it on overnight
usually when i do masks my makeup never sits correctly on my face for some reason
though the pumpkin wasn't bad by any means
it is so refreshing when you store it in your fridge
that being said- this mask does wonders for the texture of my skin
store it in your fridge for a refreshing end to your day
if i'm tired or hungover
silly me i tried this sample the way it says to on the foil packet
the product is not abrasive to my skin or sense of smell
it doesn't make my skin tight
my guess would be that it's the rose fragrance that is irritating some people's skin
i feel like it's also preventative
i think for those prone to breakouts or clogged pores would probably not want to use it in this way
can't tell that it brightens or makes a difference on my skin
it's a big container for the money
i sometimes use it overnight sometimes as a mask.
it's not that uncommon
yes it turns your skin red
i don't use this as a mask
nothing soothes blemishes like this does
let's hope the anti aging part of it actually holds true
a must for your skin care routine!
it doesn't feel dry or cakey on your skin
not only does it smell great it takes off all traces of makeup
i always do the "toner test" to check if there's any residue
i actually use it in the shower as a face wash
you'll definitely want to use a moisturizer with it
i love this stuff so much, and i have oily skin.
almost honey-like texture somehow helps bring out the impurities
as i sometimes do as a beauty junkie trying so many products
it's gentle and hasn't caused any problems.
it doesn't leave a residue.
this cleanser does neither.
i love this cleanser more than i can describe.
flaky patches no matter what i did
it's safe enough to use every day
a lot of times the rose smell used is way to strong or phony smelling
it reminded me a little of the cornstarch goop stuff kids make for science experiments
it removes all of my makeup so no need to use a makeup remover before h
since its a gel you don't have to use a lot
this doesn't irritate my skin whatsoever
it's cleanses so well
i don't mind how thick it is
i usually use only water to wash my face
as i've come to expect breakouts from any face wash or mask
it doesn't irritate my eyes at all which i love.
this is the first thing that i can actually use to take off eye makeup thoroughly without irritation
just add water if it's not spreading well enough
the bottle lasts me forever
if you're a person with younger skin
i love that it's not heavily scented
not over drying and doesn't leave a gross film.
it doesn't cause any breakouts
oh and it's huge, it's the size of my body wash!!
maybe that's the stem cells?
it's never been softer
this stuff is magic in a bottle
i don't feel that my skin has been stripped of it's natural oils
i don't find the smell too overwhelming
if you're sensitive to smells you should probably avoid this
i got this mask on the advice of the sephora rep for my combination skin
fresh which is a big plus as i can't tolerate anything with too much fragrance
doesn't cake or crease
doesn't like i'm wearing makeup
your goal isn't to cover up flaws
you'll probably like this
i still don't find myself getting oily
it doesn't break up, get patchy, or look greasy.
it is the perfect 'foundation' for the summer since it's not heavy
i did notice this does not clog my pores as fast as other foundations
i don't cover my anything else since it leave a nice glow
really doesn't look like i'm wearing makeup
covers just enough that my imperfections disappear
i never look oily at the end of the day using this foundation
it's a completely natural finish- it's not drying
radiant finishes are usually a no-go in texas where even in november we have 80 degree days with high humidity
beautiful finish with just enough coverage to hide what needs to be hidden without a makeup-y look or feel
doesn't show any dryness of my skin like all other foundations do
t's natural looking which i love even though i wear plenty of eye makeup
it doesn't look or feel like i'm wearing any make-up
this left me with a super natural finish that provided just enough coverage to blur imperfections
it seems to really disappear on my skin
perfect weight for someone who doesn't like to wear makeup
it does even put skin tone with a sheer effect
you've got oil control
for summer skin that doesn't melt off in 2 minutes
doesn't sink into fine lines
sometimes go over it with my beauty blender after just to make sure it's really in my skin
it can occasionally cling to them
i sometimes get those on my nose or cheek
i also find it doesn't layer very well if you have any makeup underneath
in the winter it gives me just a little extra color so that i don't look like casper
if you don't work it into your skin
it magically becomes one with your skin
it's meant to be blended into the skin
it doesn't seem to oxidize into that awful orange color either
t doesn't clog any pores
where in the past it's just been oily
i would always only use concealer for spot treatment because i didn't wanna wear a heavy mask all over my skin
it's just so smooth
it's sticky at first
sun protection yet feels like nothing is on your face
the pores on my nose tend to look bigger with makeup which is obviously annoying
the makeup can't be that good...can it?
it somehow glides over pores as if you have none at all
that combined with oiliness makes me want to give up
it's great for my aging skin because it blurs the imperfections
doesn't cover a lot with just one layer.
it is so light in your skin
it doesn't clog my pore
it's enough for my everyday make up
it doesn't get oily on me throughout the day.
as this doesn't moisturize too well
there's no need for me to set it with a powder
the only thing you need to use with it is a good concealer
typically by the end of the day a light foundation or bb cream that started off great looks very oily
if you just want a more even complexion without completely covering your skin
makes your skin look flawless like you aren't wearing any make up
it feels like you aren't wearing any makeup
my pores look almost nonexistent
my very oily skin just doesn't look very oily
i would not recommend to my pale skin ladies out there
i normally don't give perricone the time of day because it's so expensive
i don't want to look like i've plastered the stuff on my face
if your skin is mostly problem free
it will give you the most dewey
no real help if you have dark circles or spots
it will make you look more youthful if your skin is clear
'm wondering how the no concealer concealer might combine with this to give a little more coverage when needed
the good news is that there's practicaly no visible coverage when it's applied as suggested
you can apply it lightly for a sheer look or you can build it for a more flawless look
it is long-wearing, even with my oily t-zone.
the only critique i would give it is that my skin looks a little "dewy" after applying it
like how your face looks just after applying moisturizer
also nice that it's anti aging and has spf 30.
the problem is it's sort of dark for my fair skin
i really like this foundation it's super light weight
that's ok because it blends really well with almost any concealer
i like that its light and doesn't cake.
this winter it's a little too dark
can't even tell your wearing makeup!
covers what i want to hide without being heavy
doesn't look like i'm wearing any foundation at all
i always wear some form of coverup
this foundation serum somehow manages to look amazing despite my cute little skin issues
even in the disgustingly sticky
that it's so light weight
don't like wearing other foundations because i find them to be too cakey or irritating
this does not make my t zone oily nor my cheeks dry
i didn't want it to be heavy or cakey
this covers just enough to lighten their appearance
i don't need or use heavy foundation
i am convinced that the people who are complaining it's too orange accidentally got the bronzer which is packaged in the same bottle
"makeup" that won't break you out.
it's pretty much your serum
i typically don't like to wear a full face of foundation--in fact
i usually just apply it around my t-zone to even out some of my redness in that area
have been struggling with finding a product with some spf that doesn't make me rash
best of all it doesn't make my skin oily like other moisturizers
with this gel it didn't
you can literally feel the product being absorbed into your skin
you'll also notice that your skin becomes softer to the touch over time as well
it literally causes your skin to feel tighter
because i thought the tingly sensation was supposed to wake you up
it can make you look a bit shiny
flaky even it i used it with a heavy moisturizer
believe it or not applying this "oil" seems to have made my face less-oily over time
didn't feel that i needed high amounts of retinol
plus it's all natural so i love it!
it's not distracting or overwhelming either
doesn't irritate my skin
it almost melts when you try to get it out
would know within days if it was irritating my skin
this does not feel heavy or greasy
it is expensive 48$ now to the products it has ofcourse a rosey smell really nice it's more like a sticky lotion than gel
t has a bit of a sticky feeling when it's first applied
i know it's super expensive
now i don't even wear makeup
not greasy at all.
you may wana just bite the bullet on this one
it's good not skin changing though.
you may feel a little sticky before bed
this stuff is a miracle in a bottle!
the pimples are not that big
i know it's pricey
i did not break out or notice clogged pores- that's positive
moisturized yet it never felt greasy or too heavy to me
can't wait to add it to my nightly routine
didn't want breakouts on top of flakiness
you can even mix a few drops of this into your mask
doesn't irritate my eyes
it is not greasy.
i do not think it reduces wrinkles
it's done wonders for my undereye area
it's a little surprising to find it's become a soft
i typically find eye creams to be too greasy
with this eye cream you can't even tell i'm having an allergy reaction
t doesn't creep into your eyes making them feel oily
can't fix natural skin pigmentation unfortunately
my only gripe is that it makes my eyes water from time to time
i don't find it sticky
my husband can smell it, too.
it won't do anything for wrinkles or circles or lifting
i love how it doesn't irritate my eyes at all
it's so hydrating yet it's not heavy or greasy!
i don't see any brightening of them with this product
it kinda sits on the skin
i wish it wasn't so fragranced though because initially it did make my eyes itchy from irritation
pros:• smells amazing• really hydrating• made skin appear "plumper" • didn't cause break outs*
doesn't give me milia
it's a great product to add into your routine anyways
i don't have issues with dark circles
i never get mila- the little white bumps or any other skin conditions under my eye
it doesn't linger or cause any problems for me
i don't know about anti-aging
doesn't absorb right away
the only bad thing is it runs out fast compare to other eye creams
sometimes my other eye creams have created a weird texture with my concealer or foundation
it's definitely a must if you have dry eyes.
like a dab and it's still amazing!
i also want to try out fresh's other eye creams too :
doesn't help with wrinkles nor dark spots
usually i feel burn my eyes with others eye cream
i don't typically need an eye cream
doesn't do much for dark circles or puffiness
whenever i put this eye cream on i get instant hydration
this didn't really do much for my eyes except moisturize
doesn't irritate my eyes at all
some eye creams i've tried make it hard to apply makeup on top because they were too thick
i don't expect my eye cream to work miracles
go light, you'll love it.
this is the only eye cream i've used that is gentle enough
you can't smell the scent anymore once you apply it under your eyes which is good
i even use it as an eye cream.
this cream does the trick for me
really just needed a lightweight moisturizer to go under my make up that wouldn't feel greasy or bother my sensitive skin
it didn't cause my skin to look or feel greasy.
if you don't like the smell of roses though
i feel like less creasing goes on when i've got this bad boy on underneath my concealer
the only thing i recommend when using this is letting it penetrate the skin
i can't say if this has brightened my dark undereye circles
works well under makeup, didn't sting my eyes.
this gel-cream is exactly what i need: not oily
doesn't help with the wrinkle or dark circles
its a good eye moisturizer that i can say
doesn't become stiff or crusty under eyes.
am constantly paranoid about getting wrinkles
a small dab of this cream 15min before i apply makeup really really helps
this is the only one that doesn't smell bad
i know 150 bucks seems steep
annnnd it would be cool to sashay into my thirties without them
because the blackheads on my nose get really bad
it does help me with the pore
the soothing strips that you put on afterwards have all of this great moisture in them so you don't feel like you're killing your nose with the treatment
a lot of people say that they're useless
the first patch will not work if you don't wet your nose first
anything that says pores i've tried
it pulled so much disgusting junk out of his pores
they didn't irritate his sensitive skin either.
it didn't look like much on the strip itself
it works so well when you take off the first step 1 the dry one you can see all the nasty stuff on the mask
it doesn't aggravate my skin
it's a little steep... 1 patch for $8?
it's amazing and removed all the gross oils too
my nose looked like i didn't have a single blackhead once in my life
looking at the pore pad i didn't see anything
they pull out so much gunk form your nose
definitely doesn't pull everything out of your pores
definitely not the stripes you buy at the drugstore
the first stripe makes you go "beurk" because it really goes into your pores
you can actually see your blackhead glued to the stripe when you remove it
they get out sooo much gunk from your pores
admittedly i don't really have a pore or blackhead problem persay
i won't ever use another nose strip.
here's the thing with patches
then you'll know if you'll like the product
not only do you have a strip that pulls the blackheads out
who doesn't like ripping stuff out of their pores with glorified duct tape?
neither strips irritates my skin either
don't catch too much skin underneath my eyes
it's an easy way to entertain yourself at night when you look at all the gunk on your used strip
these strips got a lot of big blackheads completely out
i couldn't believe all the gunk that came out of my nose
you can see the blackheads on the actual strip which is reassuring
i've tried a few other strips before that are suppose to remove/reduce blackheads
have not tired any nose strips like these yet.
they get out at least 7 times as many blackheads as the biore strips
it's so satisfying to pull it off
i think the second strip is kind of useless
i suppose the nose strip would work just fine in other areas
this product seems polarizing--either it works for you or it doesn't
literally rate judge every product i use- i'm super picky
i think maybe one a month combined with boscia's black pore strips every week will suffice
really seem to fade out the wrinkles
the night cream doesn't seem to make a difference
it's hard to control the amount you put on as its so thick
so your fingers don't go in the jar.
i will say the day side has a brightener
but if you've got the dough, i recommend it!
just brightens your face overall even if you're going makeup free
peels i'm starting to think that they can't be helped
the night cream actually does help reduce puffiness on me
who doesn't want extra spf
i dont have a lot of deep eye wrinkles
it's a comfort to know i have an "eye safe" spf on during the day
if you struggle with texture you need this in your life
only thing that gets rid of my breakouts!!
couldn't even feel a pore or imperfection.
i decided to give this one a try since i have oily skin
people seem to complain about the smell
the smell is not overwhelming like some of the other gg masks
it has a earth smell if anything
it mad my skin burn a little
just remember it's all in the name of beauty
there's this weird smell that lingers after you first apply it
also the tingly feeling when you first apply the product is a little weird
i love how it doesn't strip the oils from my skin
i get occasional breakouts
enough that if i change up my skin care routine with the wrong products i get little bumps
and it didn't irritate my skin!
doesn't leave my face feeling raw which is amazing
somehow the powermud beats them all
sometimes age doesn't change things
for those of you with really sensitive skin that can't h
i love this it's does give you a strong tingle
i love how it turns to an oil when you wash it off
know that it will sting/tingle
couldn't find anything to moisturize enough
doesn't require scraping it off
i can't wait to order a jar
it's definitely a pampering feeling product as it's not too harshly exfoliating or drying
makes your skin so comfortable that it doesn't feel like you've used a harsh treatment even though this is effective
i always give my face a quick cleansing to remove any excess makeup or oil so the mask can focus on the stuff that's deep in your pores
i seriously don't even want to put moisturizer on because my face feels so soft
every few weeks my skin gets pretty oily
love how it's a mud to oil treatment
couldn't decide to get this or the white one
it doesn't work so well as the white
if you're seeking for a gentle cleaning
if i want a deep
i like the effects it keeps my skin in check
yet not oily whatsoever
sometimes a few pimples at a time sometimes one
the one warning is that if you exfoliate before using this product it will burn
i love the feeling of the 'mud to oil' when you rinse it off
does seem to really clean out the buildup
i typically only wear makeup on the weekends
you literally see the stuff come out of your pores
doesn't dry out my skin like other masks tend to do
t can be difficult for me to find something that clears my pores without making my skin red
love how my skin looks like when i rinse it off
i feel like it's working to pull out all of the toxins in my skin
i can't wait to add this to my regular skin care regimen
i feel like it's gentle enough to use more frequently than the other masks
it's perfect for those days when you just feel kinda gross like your makeup was sitting heavy on your skin
you want to clean those pores out good
congested look i can sometimes get
i like it - some nights it tingles but, mildly.
i cannot wear this in the daytime
i don't find it drying or irritating
as much as i'd love to wear this underneath my makeup
i wasn't too saggy to begin with
otherwise it gets sticky
although i took a star off because it's pretty sticky
i usually use this eye cream in my night routine
yes it's kinda sticky
this stuff is like miracle in a jar.
i suppose if it really bothers you you can apply your regular moisturizer or night cream on your brow bone
it does feel tacky after you put it on
which sounds like is a turn off to some
i read somewhere that there's a cream version of this
you won't even look tired
i agree it's sticky.
i somehow always stray right back to ole!
i never was good at shopping for eye treatment stuff because i dnt like touching my face due to noticeable winkles
doesn't irritate your skin?
too much & it will be goopy.
this gel is not for you if your not into thick gels
i need only use the teensiest amount for each eye
it's one of the very few eye products that doesn't irritate my eyes
it does make your eyes look less droopy in the morning
the only thing i dislike about this product is that it's very sticky when it dries down
if you are often sleep deprived
if they don't i just use the origins ginsing eye cream which is not sticky
sometimes i forget to do my night routine
because you don't want to use too much or your skin might get too sticky
i've found there are now more days that i don't need concealer under my eyes
it doesn't soak in
if you are sleep deprived or have any irritation under your eyes i recommend this
a lot of people don't like the texture.
i normally have terrible dark circles
i like that it's a gel since it feels cooling on your skin
so the tackiness shouldn't be as much of an issue
it is definitely tacky for a while after applying it
i do not have puffy eyes at all
that's because gel is meant only for nighttime
that's why they don't make gel foundation :)
i didn't find it unpleasant
i couldn't imagine using the gel under anything
firms the eye area i cant say for de-puffing i don't get puffy eyes
if your worried about crows feet this is the eye gel for you
on nights i don't use it i have serious bags
for those who are complaining about it being too sticky
i don't even deal with much puffiness
it doesn't feel sticky
yes it's sticky but don't let it deter you!
it's a gel which sits atop the skin rather than a moisturizer
it doesn't take much and a jar lasts a long time.
it's def only for nighttime
it's cooling when you apply it
you don't need much i usually get a small dab to do my eyes
cannot go under makeup
or it can be sticky
it truly takes the puffiness away
i don't have very bad undereye circles
do not use this in the daytime or under your makeup
it's to sticky to stay awake for long with it
yet doesn't dry skin out or leave it feeling uncomfortable or red
it won't do much for deep wrinkles
it doesn't do much for active pimples
it can really add to your skin care routine
won't burn your face off
this one it's one of my top 5 if you have acne
this mask doesn't make my face burn it just tingles for about 10 seconds
it does it's magic
my skin does normally get red under the sun or when it's irritated
i typically use it when my skin is feeling really textured or dull
it's nothing too bad
as much as i tried popping them which i know only caused breakouts or more irritation
this stuff is gentle enough that it doesn't irritate my sensitive skin
the only "bad" thing about this is the pumpkin pie smell
it's gives you the results it claims
completely ignored this pumpkin mask thinking it wouldn't work well for my skin
my face became so oily that my makeup would look horrible
it's nothing too bad
the amount that is used each time is minuscule because it's a gel like consistency
taking it off can be a little bit of a pain- it's kind of a sticky mess
doesn't irritate my skin
there's no redness after
it doesn't leave my face tight
there's nothing an oily skin gal loves better than a good scrub
didnt mind cause i figured its a resurfacer
give me some moisture to ensure it won't do any damage
if you can make the splurge
i didn't realize it was an exfoliator at first
wash well some beads can still stay behind i just follow with to we to make sure i'm squeaky clean
you do get a bit of a tingly sensation when you first apply it
it burned a bit at first which didn't surprise me as my skin is sensitive to physical exfoliants
it's a bonus that you smell like a pumpkin pie after using it
it's the mask working
it's not painful at all
the tingling feeling really isn't that bad after a minute or two
it tingles a bit when you first apply it
it's not too harsh
it has a nice grit as well that doesn't feel like you're about to scratch off your skin
he doesn't even wash his face.
my only issue is the darn packaging!
although i don't feel any tingling
not willing to give up on this luscious product yet
is not too irritating compared to other masks
this mask is not for the timid!
so even though it's pricey
you have to scrub a bit
even then it still feels like there's some residue
t helps get rid of any blemishes i always get
this will last me forever because literally a pea size amount is all you need for it to pulsate
it means it's working
i love that it's a scrub and mask.
i looked at reviews to see if it's normal
3- it dries out any pimple i have which is great for acne users
usually i hate doing this because the lighting in that bathroom reveals every single flaw
if you're into skin care
it does tingle a little
doesn't sting or burn
maybe because the cucumber one is so ubiquitous
it seemed kind of boring
this does a great job polishing your skin with those little beads
was a tiny bit hesitant about using this at first because it's a chemical exfoliator
it's the only face mask that i've used that i've noticed a difference in my skin
it still tingles when i apply it
if this mask could only get rid of my discoloration it would be the absolute most perfect facial product i'd ever used
i usually go for the charcoal kinds
right after you take it off you can tell the difference with the texture of your skin
i ultimately chose this one because i don't have an acne issue besides the occasional bump from tweezing
i did massage it lightly
my pores suddenly didn't exist!
this does burn and i dont have sensative skin.
although the "un wrinkle" pads are nice
i love face mask because it forces me to take some downtime
this didn't burn my skin like most masks tend to do
somehow still super oily in the t-zone
this mask is my go to mask when my face is looking dull
no matter how much moisturizer i used it still seemed lifeless
other than that i don't think it's irritating at all
it basically exfoliates your face while making it easy to treat things like pimples
i wouldn't say gentle
its essentially a chemical peel duh!!
so my end result is always super soft even skin thats glows
i wouldn't say it removes wrinkles or anything
i tend to get too lazy at night
or even mascara all the way
it's gentle and lasts you a long time too!
you'll feel squeaky clean and fresh.
it also has a good lather when applying to your face
it doesn't have a strong smell
my skin looks great after using this i usually have some redness to my cheeks especially
it's even safe for around the eye area
doesn't leave you feeling tight
for me this works amazing removes all the makeup my makeup remover wipe couldn't get off my face feels so so soft
it doesn't have any fragrances which is a plus
this cleanser does not leave my face feeling tight
shouldn't ever be used to cleanse the skin i don't think it removes anything i had to add wipes to my routine
no tight or squeaky feel
takes all your makeup off too!
i can now use a very small amount of moisturizer that just glides over my skin
even after using the genius cleanser from this line
there is never any residue or makeup left on my skin
s an effective makeup remover so you can skip having to carry around cotton pads
definitley makes the face feel squeaky clean
nothing a little moisturizer can't fix!
doesn't strip my skin
though it doesn't add hydration for me
it's the perfect 2 in 1 product if you don't want to use a makeup remover
does a super job getting all the grime off my face
i usually only wash my face with either st
it doesn't feel harsh or irritate my eyes.
i still get the occasional pimple
-doesn't strip the skin-i don't have redness after washing like i did with purity-has a pump that dispenses the perfect amount for the whole face
doesn't strip the skin
this does what it says it does--it removes makeup
it does not make my face red or cause breakouts
i didn't see a difference in my complexion or in the firmness of my skin
wasn't irritating at all
you don't want something to clog your pores
give you more pimples
see how makeup might slip from this easily
so yes i do recommend for no makeup or at night or minimal makeup days
my skin is so dull
it's not ideal for summer as it's a bit too hydrating
i wouldn't call it a "brightening" or "whitening" product because it doesn't make your skin lighter than you naturally should be
the cream does not make it look any more oily than it is
it's not oily for me
it does have a bit of an oily consistency to it
the only thing is it takes a bit to soak in.
i will say that it can feel a bit oily at first
it didn't irritate the skin on my face or neck
it should be a little dewy
even though it's expensive
can't comment on the anti-aging effects as much however it makes my skin look amazing
definitely don't use it in the morning under makeup or you'll have your foundation slide off your face
doesn't have any mineral oils which you can find in some other pricey br
just thrown them out because they were either too greasy or too thin
so rich feeling in your h
it's not greasy or oily.
i feel like it's preserving the skin that i've used harsh acne treatments on for so many years
i can never use lotion on my face because i break out
i can't determine if the serum is helping my skin or if it's all in my head
it is super easy to apply face makeup to mask the rosacea redness which was impossible before
don't forget your ears!
when i see people with dry ears it's so gross.
it leaves me skin silly smooth
i still get acne
any time my skin is in a bad mood i use this
i break out if my skin doesn't like a product
i just can't bring myself to spend $60 on an oz of any beauty product
doesn't leave the skin greasy
doesn't break out my skin.
it smells like all of their products
most certainly does not smell like bbq chips
it doesn't do much in the way for helping redness
i consider it a plus if a product doesn't make my skin worse
i trade off using this with the even better dark spot corrector classic which i love
this gets rid of my acne scars just as well
who usually doesn't notice such things
i do want to diminish the look of my freckles
i certainly want to banish the look of those pesky fine lines
it's hella expensive for the size
maybe it's because i apply this after toner
it's only one layer in my routine
these days it's toned down some
i don't get pimples/spots often
you can see that alot of the acne scars
it almost calms my skin because i've noticed throughout the day it is not as oily
it makes makeup remove so easy.
it does not contain shea
i am skeptical of cleansing oils fearing they will leave my oily areas more so
doesn't leave my face feeling oily nor dry
ok this product really does remove mascara without much effort
i don't like my face feeling dryer out after cleansing
i love how it melts everything
doesn't irritate my eyes
i do not use this to remove my eye makeup
my eyes weren't filmy or irritated as others have experienced nor did i notice a fragrance
it doesn't feel super tight afterwards.
it's not that great at removing eye makeup
i don't use anything waterproof
otherwise i get that oily film everyone talks about
if it's tough to remove
yes i still get the occasional spots
even acne wash didn't work that well for me
this stuff removes my makeup like a charm
if you get it in your eye, it's painful.
this eye cream has people fooled
for me it's never harsh or causes any redness.
they're already barely there.
this stuff burns my eyes like nobodies business
i wasn't even shopping for eye cream
the instant i apply it there's something different
doesn't slip into my eyes
enough sleep is the only thing that diminishes it
maybe it's just the time to get a new mascara
i do not have issues with wrinkles or under eye bags
i would say this eye cream works for me in ways other eye creams have not
time will tell whether it's really reducing fine lines or wrinkles
it can sting a bit
u will love how it melts on your skin especially after you have prepped it
i really like that it's not heavy.
it's not very heavy on my skin
only complaint i have is it stings if you get it in your eye a little
you will find you do not need much if you have oily skin like mine
anti wrinkle" cream i have tried that actually does what it says
note: if you have super dry skin it might not be moisturizing enough on it's own
it does feel like it might be too rich for daytime when you first apply
does not leave an oily feeling
i can't use a lot of products as i will breakout or my skin will have dry flakes
it doesn't make your make up stay
it does go on chalky..that's normal.
didn't notice any weird smells
it didn't irritate my skin
the only negative thing about this product is it's consistency
i've never had any lasting irritation from this product once it's rinsed off
it did not harden to where it wasn't removeableremoveable or harden much at all
people have actually come up to me after i've used it to ask which salon i go to because they assume i've gotten a professional facial
it's in a squeeze style tube?
its smells nasty, i just hold my breath.
it's not just a regular exfoliator or scrub to keep normal skin in check
it does have a smell
does not bother me in the way that artificial scents normally do
i just use a small amount of my cleanser again afterward to make sure there's no residue
this stuff packs a punch
the only way i can describe it is that it smells like copper
i love this product because it's super fast acting
what will astonish you even more is how soft your skin is after
i also don't think it dries my skin out either
i find i want to wear less makeup the days i use it
it is a 1 minute facial- perhaps if you leave it on longer it could cause a sensitivity
you can use it for a quick fix.
don't care about smell or texture.
my skin is usually dull
i would rather put up with a slight strange smell for a minute than not have a product like because it doesn't smell like perfume
voila my skin no longer felt like it was burning
you can feel it's fully absorbed
it doesn't clog or feel thick
my skin just looks dehydrated even tho i'm using it day
people who are sensitive to smells don't need to worry
it absorbs pretty quickly so the sticky doesn't last
t's not like i've been schlepping around with low quality skin products
can't tell any more benefit from it than i get with ibuki beauty sleeping mask x the sleeping mask is lots cheaper
it doesn't burn my eyes
try to empty a bottle you'll realize that your skin condition has always been stable
it left my skin somewhat tacky though.
this product didn't have an offensive smell
my makeup goes on so smooth and poreless.
not realizing this is supposed to be used before your moisturizers
this won't take the place of a moisturizer so don't skip that in your routine
not greasy at all.
it's nice to wear in the morning under makeup
my skin almost doesn't need foundation because it looks even
tip: be sure to allow this product to dry on your face before you put on your moisturizer
i think when i used it by itself it just made my skin more oily because it was enhancing my moisturizer
if you're having problems with breakouts i recommend you get a sample of this to put it under acne-fighting creams
this is kinda booster of your own skin care.
and any eye cream didn't work.
it's done wonders in terms of smoothing my skin out
i truly can't believe how softly my makeup settles into my face throughout the day now that i'm using this
when i use a moisturizer after this then it's too much
dont use too much or else it can feel sticky
can't get enough of the softness
i've read that products can't really "shrink" pores
it does seem to provide some nourishment
normally during summer my face gets really oily
ladies, this product does wonders on my face.
'm not looking to lighten pigmentation or help with fine lines
it doesn't eliminate age spots
it's not oily and i like how light it is.
it's neither burning nor healing
i though it's just a big-fame like many other serums iv tried
my skin has kept it's even tone
i do believe that my skin glows because of it
you’ll love the smell too!
this may be all you need skipping the moisturizer
i did wear it under my makeup
strange scent causes me to only use it when my skin is upset
but it doesn't look too bad- this stuff helps.
it's gross to stick your fingers in it
do not need much to moisturize.
not sure if it helps with the redness of rosecea
it never irritates my skin.
if you ever suffer from itchy
my skin is super picky when it comes to any kind of lotion or mask
if you apply a sheer layer it is perfect
try it for yourself!
i don't find it clears out pores, or detoxes.
even when my skin isn't acting up
so don't expect for it to harden
so the original skin mask can sometimes feel a bit harsh
occasionally i will sleep in it
this mask doesn't sting
it was still a little tacky when i washed it off so don't expect that tight feeling most masks give you
if you head into this thinking it's going to smell like roses
i don't find it unpleasant at all, though.
you can talk normally while wearing it
it doesn't just feel like you've lathered a cream on
it's hard to explain because it's not a full on tingle
seems like everytime i do a much needed second cleanse
not good in the shower because your h
you can probably just use this as your 2-in-1 makeup remover
takes off all ofmy layers of makeup
it's not meant to lather for all those complaining about it
i don't get a greasy residue at all
not sure if it's the fragrance or the balm itself
if your environment is too cold then then it tends to leave a residue that most won't like
it's great for removing waterproof makeup.
it does leave a "film" on your skin though
it by no means is greasy
the only way i could see it feeling greasy to someone is if they had oily skin to begin with
add your favorite moisturizer afterwards or don't add anything at all
it'll dissolve your make-up
i really like this cleanser it's my second tube.
not irritating my eyes or skin
it's oily when you apply it
it works really well on melting off your makeup
i won't purchase it because the smell
i wouldn't say it's a "scent"
it's not foaming, but rather like a gel oil.
wet it to "suds" it up a wee bit
it's the little things!
i love that i don't have to wet my face to get this to lather
i love that i don't need a harsh makeup remover!
usually i just think they're okay
it does melt away makeup
does not strip your skin
doesn't make it feel too oily
i've tried many with my face as most either break it out or just doesn't work with cleaning my face
i don't have dark eye circles anymore
that being said it takes a bit of effort to rinse off on it's own
causes some eye irritation if i don't rinse well which is preventing me from making this my go-to cleanser
when i'm not in a rush i take my sweet time massaging the product onto my face
the ingredients are simply too high-quality to waste it as a makeup remover
even plain coconut oil would make more sense
you want the ingredients to go on skin that's had the makeup removed
it does a good job at removing my makeup with exception to my waterproof gel liner
sometimes i don't need a second cleanse
you do have to make sure you rinse well
to me it smells slightly like the inside of those cheap halloween masks you'd get as a kid
even makes it feel less oily throughout the day than other cleansers
doesn't remove eye makeup as well as i'd like it to
am even considering buying the moisturizer even though it's pricey
i really wanted something that would basically eliminate my need to use makeup remover wipes
was in the market for a good oil cleanser that didn't strip my skin
i don't think it's plasticy
i don't mind the smell, whatever it is.
f you are the type who only cleanses once a day or has naturally oily skin i can see where you might want to give this a pass
my fave doesn't feel tight or uncomfortable.
does not leave a greasy feel
it doesn't sting eyes at all
tried to use it like regular face cleanser which didn't work
it's a little pricey for a cleanser
i still like algenist's regular cleanser too.
i need to be careful when rinsing because it can be slightly irritating to my eyes
even though it's a bit pricey
doesn't irritate or cause breakouts
you just want to keep massaging it over your face
i do not wear a ton of makeup to begin with just tinted moisturizer
when you put water on it thats when it foams your skin feels amazing after you rinse
it doesn't feel tight because it didn't strip my face of oil
any way you remove this cleanser will work
it's become a necessity for me!
the only con is that the product is so thick
it is so thick that i haven't had any leakage when i put some into a travel bottle
it doesn't cause breakouts
this is gentle yet removes all my long-wear makeup
i dont think there is any cleanser that is tear-free
recommend you dont use it for eye makeup
the scent tends to stay around for awhile
initially it's a bit awkward to rub into the skin
it is never irritating
this is the only cream that has completely gotten rid of the eczema
the mask doesn't show on the face.
i do use it quite liberally.
it's my new go to eye cream.
i can't really claim if it "works" with anti aging
i don't have a lot of wrinkles
it does not sting my eyes
finding an eye cream that doesn't burn or make my eyes water is wonderful
plumps my normally dehydrated skin which truly makes my fine lines/wrinkles practically disappear
this amazing eye cream will treat every concerns you may have "360around the eye" a genius treatment for your eyes
i don't have any wrinkles
it's a little awkward to get it out of the jar due to it's consistency
can't speak to it's performance with makeup
it's the only thing that helped my acne
isn't over producing oil anymore
i still can't use it daily as it makes my skin too red
i don't feel/see the same redness
....if you can get past the outhouse-esque smell.
this product will do magic for your skin.
except the smell is horrid
flakiness is now a thing of the past
because of course i am still acne prone
i like that it doesn't get foamy or have a strong scent
it doesn't strip my skin.
don't have any problems with residue
it doesn't burn or sting
or whatever cleanser you love
i don't really use it as a make up remover
i just wanted to make it clear that i don't use this as a makeup remover
so this review is not about it's makeup removing capability
would recommend this to anyone with flaky skin
even if that feeling is unpleasant to you
the product does melt your makeup away.
this stuff is amazing when it comes to melting away your makeup
they started to irritate my skin
usually i just use a simple makeup wipe
the wipe doesn't always melt my waterproof makeup
it really does melt all of it away
feels so luxurious going onto your face
almost as if i don't need to apply moisturizer
it's perfect for those nights that i just want to take my makeup off
it does leave a film on your skin
it doesn't burn or sting as long as you don't get it in your eyes
doesn't sting your eyes at all
don't use it to removed my makeup
i don't have to do that with this cleanser
it really does melt everything away.
it's even good for summer with my oily face
it does a good job of removing all the eye makeup especially the waterproof ones
younger users may feel it makes their skin too oily
it does truly melt away makeup
easy way to get off all of your makeup
because it can leave some dark residue from mascara etc
i want to just use a cleansing cloth
i know that's not ideal for every day use plus cleansing cloths make my eyes sting
i love the fact that it doesn't dry my face out like other products
doesn't leave you super oily
i don't wear much make up
it doesn't irritate me at all
removing mascara has never been easier without any irritation either
i do find i have to wash my face extra thoroughly after use since it can be tough to get rid of that oily residue
i noticed that this cleanser doesn't always take off all my makeup
i've never been the person to care much about removing my makeup aka make-up wipes used to be my best friends
i don't like using this as a face cleanser as i find it to be a bit too oily for my liking
this is the only product so far that easily removes kylie jenner's matte lipstick
i will say it's more of a makeup remover than overall cleanser
i never found anything hydrating that didn't irritate my sensitive skin
this is so nice to just gently rub over makeup
doesn't feel greasy by any means
it's a dream team for makeup removing
it's easily removed once you dry your face
easy to remove eye makeup too
i don't know that it's helped with the congested pores
if you are a teen or in your twenties you probably should stick to foaming cleansers
in taking off makeup because it doesn't dry or pull skin
i find regular makeup removers to be too drying so this is perfect
it's really important to keep wetness out of the container
this cleanser doesn't leave my skin the least bit greasy feeling
where as it's massaged in
because you use less water it's less messy
it takes off all of my makeup even mascara
i normally use peter thomas roth rose stem cell cleansing gel because it was the only cleanser that would completely remove my makeup
i wouldn't use this if you have oily skin
otherwise i get breakouts
you should always cleanse your skin twice if removing makeup
it really does melt off my makeup
it is supposed to get milky once you add water
this cleanser does exactly what it says- melts the makeup right off
i felt like i couldn't get it rinsed off
i did not find that it left any sort of oily residue on my skin
it does leave a film on your skin if you don't use a brush or washcloth to remove it though
even benefit they're real mascara was no match.
it's a gel that becomes an oil
makeup just melts off
it does remove all of the makeup
everyone keeps posting that it doesn't cleanse their skin
it's still dirty afterwards
it's not meant to be a full facial cleanser
it's for taking off your makeup
just using your face wash won't actually get everything off your face
you're actually cleaning your face
that's because you do still need to wash your face
i don't mind using a stick to remove product
without irritating my skin or eyes at all
this cleanser doesn't irritate or make my skin more dry as a lot of cleansers do
there's a reason it's called "melting cleanser".
benefit they're real mascara
which is a bummer for anyone over 30 with acne because you want to stay youthful
they either left my skin feeling greasy
for me it's not oily at all
if you think your face is clean
i can't stop touching it
you'll see it transform from jelly to oil
in fact doesn't even fell like i need moisturizer after
leaves your face feeling good that you don't need to wash your face again after using it
it actually removes every trace of makeup in one go
honestly it cleanses well enough that i can easily skip the second cleansing which i some times do
thought it'd be messy
it never dries out my skin or leaves it feeling greasy or slick
it does not leave my skin feeling greasy after each use
the most amazing thing is that it removes all my waterproof eye makeup
it's super gentle and doesn't break my skin out.
make sure to put some moisturizer on because i do find that it dries my skin out a little bit
it's pricey, but it works.
it doesn't sting my eyes
this takes off all my makeup, even mascara.
not a bunch of cheap useless products
if you don't know much about mineral oil
it doesn't clog pores
it almost feels like you don't even need to wash with a cleanser
it doesn't leave your skin oily
for one thing it does not have any acne causing or irritating ingredients
i know you're thinking this is counterintuitive for someone with oily s
leaves no residue no trace of makeup at all that after i go in w my clarisonic it's still white like as if i wasn't wearing any makeup at all
heavy duty enough that it doesn't clog my pores cuz i have oily skin
this is the only makeup remover that actually works for me
i could never get every trace of my gel liner or mascara off before
doesn't cause any irritation of my sensitive skin
wake up with no raccoon eyes even tho you 'think' you've gotten it all off
most removers are too harsh or just don't take everything off like they should
it's a little on the pricey side
it's meant to remove your makeup.
if you're going to use a cleansing oil
prices don't scare me when it comes to my skin care
i probably should've gotten advice from a salesperson
i now can find concealers that actually work!
you may need to lightly dab a moisturizer over this product after it's had a couple of minutes to absorb in
it doesn't make my eyes water
i don't find anything longlasting effects about this product
instantly absorbs, doesn't just sit on skin.
it doesn't make the eye skin look "tight"
it doesn't work overnight
maybe i haven't used this "long enough" to see its anti-aging effects
i often wear it completely alone without makeup
it's really light, and sinks right in.
doesn't sting my eyes
it smells nice and isn't too greasy.
it's pricey for what seems like such a small amount of product
you want something that is not greasy or oily
my laugh lines were not deep or insane
like to wear under my makeup as well.
i cannot wear the non-chemical sunblock because it leaves a white film on my face that makes me look like i'm wearing makeup 10 shades too light
it is not greasy
it's thicker than i expected but not greasy.
doesn't leave my skin greasy
not greasy or too heavy.
sometimes i throw on my no makeup makeup from the line
sometimes just the no lipstick lipstick
doesn't have a fragrance which i like.
it's not often that i use a product
it does plump your skin
not greasy at all.
the ovm does seem to build up the cheeks
my usual moisturizer wasn't cutting it.
it's a must for any of my fellow skin care junkies
it's made it more smooth
i like that it doesn't have a strong smell like some other perricone products
the light weight doesn't feel heavy under my makeup
goes on easily and doesn't leave any residue.
i got this to see if i can use as an eye cream to smooth out wrinkles under my eyes
i ususally don't drink milk unless its almond
it does seem to soften any lines or wrinkles you have
id always wake up crusty
a bit pricey if you don't have hydration issues
never had that heavy greasy feel
even after the first application you'll notice a difference
i love it because it gives my skin the hydration it needs yet its not heavy on the skin
i wouldn't call this mask mask.
sometimes when i'm lazy to put on my moisturizers lol
if you suffer from acne
have to use prescription medicine for it that makes your skin super dry then you need this
this stuff stays sticky for a loooong time
this is still sticky when i go to bed even if i've applied it at 4:00
even that is problematic if you apply it to your décolletage too- you basically have to take a sponge bath
putting this mask on it gives you the hydration you need in your skin
the scent is refreshing enough not to bother you before you head to bed
the smell is just a bonus though.
doesn't make you wake up with stuff all over the pillow
nor turn into a greaseball
i love to use this mask when my skin is getting flakey
let just say due to breastfeeding my face is like soooooo dry i put this on for 10 min before bed
now let me preface this by saying i have normal soft smooth skin
plus you can't beat the price.
even with my combo skin
not at all greasy
which i'm trying to be careful with since i get oily in the t zone
mattifies not sticky at all
it doesn't feel oily on the skin
couldn't stop smelling me
it won't fix any residual redness or anything crazy
i don't suggest getting if you don't like the scent
if you are too oily you may not need the extra hydration
this never makes me oily
you won't get breakouts
if used very sparingly as a moisturizer topper will last forever as it's 100ml rather than the 50ml you usually get with face masks
once applied it is not greasy or uncomfortable to wear overnight
i love that this mask doesn't transfer on my pillow
not greasy at all
it was so bad that my entire face was flaky
i no longer have the flakiness
doesn't leave my skin feeling clogged
this doesn't break me out or make me more oily in my trouble spots
i guess at that point it's almost more of a hydrating primer
sometimes i just use it as a moisturizer.
i usually have combo skin
my favourite thing about this mask is that you can wear it while you sleep
or caused any other sorts of havoc with my normal-ish skin
i would recommend this product to anyone who literally needs moisture in their skin over night
doesn't leave your face feeling oily at all
you can even use this under makeup!!
i normally dread moisturizer because it feels so heavy
it is not irritating at all
it perfectly moisturizers overnight for brighter perfected skin that actually feels like a million bucks
i will still occasionally breakout
sometimes when i don't feel like cleansing i just put this on because it does the same
this really helped with the flakiness
the smell is not cloying as some say
there's brands that i can't use anything.
some people dislike the smell
probably because of the fragrance
during the winter i had super dry flaky skin which doesn't usually happen to me because my skin is usually oily
not only does it smell like green tea to me
which i was scared of since it's a pretty thick cream
most creams either make my skin too greasy or don't do enough hydrating at all
it evens my skin out enough to make makeup look flawless
your skin will be tacky overnight
it is the only thing i found that helps my face after it's been exposed to chlorine
i usually don't have trouble with smells
recommendation: smell before you buy!
it does not irritate my sensitive skin or clog my pores
remains tacky all night long
it's not too heavy either
this doesn't irritate it at all
it does go on tacky
so careful how you sleep with this on
so once winter comes i am always in desperate need of a super rich moisturizer
the perfume might irritate your skin a little if you have sensitive skin
love the serum some skins take a few months to work it's not all the same
i would recommend to anyone wanting to lighten dark spots
if you're having trouble with getting rid of acne scars
i recommend this product if your tackling your dark spots
this helps even out my skin tone
i don't have new pimples any more
often i do get them because of hormones
not only does it lighten the marks
of course this product isn't cheap
it doesn't sting and isn't sticky or smell bad.
just won't use everyday
once you feel it absorb don't rub anymore because it will bubble up as some people have said
it doesn't break me out or cause irritation.
i don't have any wrinkles to fix
my skin wouldn't absorb it anymore
i recommend this product if your tackling your dark spots
since it's so thick it seems that one jar will go a very long way
like the texture, but not the smell
this stuff has a bunch of fruit extract in it
doesn't cause any of the little bumps around eyes
their products really just don't pick skin types
it's great as a makeup remover.
if i have a full face of makeup on it does take me 2 washes
this doesn't irritate me at all
not sure if it's due to the face wash or just my body changing
i especially love that it takes off my eye makeup without harsh scrubbing or stinging
dries out easily if i use anything too harsh
i don't find it "strong" enough for a nighttime cleanse to get makeup off
it's great for a gentle cleanse in the morning when all i want to do is get off my heavy night moisturizer
i alternate cleansers because i think it's a good idea
i don't know if a cleanser can get more perfect.
it actually keeps a lather until it's rinsed off
does not burn my eyes
i realize something that this product make my skin so oily
i can't say it beats sheseido for leaving skin super soft
you may not like it if you are wanting a natural or mild scent
i wouldn't describe this as moisture rich like its title
i am very lazy when it comes to makeup removal
my past experience has taught me that if it foams it will strip your skin
the scent of this cleanser may be a little harsh for some
i notice my skin gets dull when i skip a couple days
i see that people with oily skin problems really love this product
it's like miracle water
unlike some serums i've tried there is no film or greasiness in my t-zone
it's worse in winter.
this product didn't increase the oil on my skin like other ones usually do
the only thing i don't like about it is that it's a pipet type tool where you have to drip the serum onto your face
my skin doesn't feel tight
have to always use toners or some kind of wipe after to make sure all makeup excess is gone after i shower
not a trace of makeup afterwards
this is a great face wash for everyday it doesn't dry out my skin i love it
it doesn't break me out or irritate my skin
i absolutely won't spend a lot of money for cleansers because i think their purpose is to remove makeup
any "skin care" benefits they may claim justifies a higher price tag is just not true imo because you're washing any fancy pants ingredients off your face
doesn't over dry my face a nice everyday face cleaner
i like this because it is non-irritating to my skin
the feel, smell and price you can't bet.
love how simple this cleanser is
doesn't leave my skin feeling too taut after use.
can't wait to use this bottle up
so far i like the product is has a clean refreshing smell
doesn't leave skin tight
it's also a big bottle it!
now it's all smooth
i wouldn't say it exfoliates that much
if anything i would say that my skin is less dry than after i use other cleansers
didn't make my skin more oily than normal
not any less oily either
i guess this might be suitable for those with oily skin
gets your face clean and it's affordable.
doesn't strip away the much needed moisture my combo skin needs
i can actually feel my skin being squeeky clean.
i mean, who doesn't want to look radiant??
i always felt that i needed a separate eye makeup remover anyhow
doesn't dry one's skin too much
my makeup comes off super easily.
a quick tip is i use this after washing my face or when i'm lazy i use this after i use a makeup facial wipe
my face is naturally already very red- so anytime it doesn't like a product i get itchy red patches
weird bumps that aren't exactly pimples
it's great to be able to exfoliate without using the harsh beads
it really takes all the grime off
the pc doesn't lather even when i have 4-5 pumps
it's amazing the texture change you get with just one use
it's like it sticks or something?
seriously, you need this in your routine!!
it did make my skin sting
i only use it nights my skins really red
it actually soothes most of my acne flare ups as well
i don't have any acne
it doesn't feel like it's stripping my skin
this cleanser neither break me out nor give me red spot
the cleansing foam is not too harsh
doesn't contain any irritating ingredients
i love that it only takes one pump of this cleanser to take off makeup
i do not like sticking my fingers in a pot
i cannot believe it's safe for eye area!
i hate facial creams because they all make me break out at some point
the combination of the two makes my skin so smooth that i can't stop touching my face
regardless of the fact that my oily
i do find i'm less oily too, which is amazing.
out of no where which is weird because i'm a very oily person
used it tentatively because i thought it would be too greasy for my acne-prone skin
kind of like an insanely squeaky clean feeling
i swear my face looks like it lost weight- it was so defined
voila not so dry skin anymore
if your skin is as bad as mine
you can put whatever you haven't used in the fridge
i usually don't get it on my face
my skin tends to be really oily through my tzone
which i don't even have a problem with breakouts unless it's new products
couldn't even feel it on my face until i washed it off
it really does lock in your cleanser
like i usually do in the morning
it's almost time to reorder...
nothing i use seems to hydrate it enough
without color or smell i thought i'd be ok
i often get compliments on my skin
i usually am not crazy about gel masks
is not sticky at all
it makes you feel like you've spent a day at the spa
it soothes any irritation you might have
won't cause any more irritation or issues because it cleans your skin as it hydrates deep down
isn't sticky or too heavy
love that is can be a sleep in or rinse off
it did not irritate my skin as so many night creams do
doesn't feel like it's suffocating my skin
now i just use it on my oily t-zone to control shine
great for my occasionally big zits too!
i usually am an oily mess within 2 hours of makeup even with a mattifying primer
the beads are not hard.
it does not take a lot of the serums to cover my face
for a small bottle, it's quite pricey.
i recommend you do a skin test to figure out which serums you actually need
it is not sticky or leaves any coloration like some of the other products i've tried
it does not last super long because with 2 drops it comes out thick
i didn't realize my skin was so dehydrated until it drank up this little gem
my skin don't feel so dry anymore just after 2 weeks of nightly application
i like that it is light on my skin
i did notice that my flares are less often
i think it's because of its hydrating effects that my pores need not open bigger
i don't have to blot at all
didn't leave my face feeling gross
it really does contour your face!
it didn't bother my combo/oily skin anymore
if you're already thin don't buy this.
you're wasting your money.
i usually barely had enough sleep time
it works for me but it's pricy.
you also need to massage your face with this lotion to get the result you want
for me it just doesn't help my skin retain moisture throughout the day
i can feel a little sticky at first
i don't like to use it just by itself as it makes my face really tacky
her words: "don't stop using this stuff!"
the consistency of the serum itself is seriously not a big deal especially if your using it under your moisturizer
whenever i feel dull i use a few drops of this stuff
it can feel a little "gluey" at first
my face is not too shiny
don't really have many wrinkles
it's never too early to start preventing wrinkles
i don't normally notice a big difference with these serums
t does not congest the skin like a lot of silicone
because it's impossible to stop the sag
if you sniff the bottle
it doesn't smell like anything on your face
always have a problem with my concealer creasing no matter what i set it with
makes your skin so perfect before applying any foundation or powder
they're not all that noticeable until i put face makeup on
i get pretty oily throughout the day so these silicone based products were just not working
it's completely different than other wrinkle fillers
i think it's just the makeup that it dries out a little
it's not as effective on acne scars
i don't know why companies still put things in jars or dropper bottles that are meant to be put in ones h
so there's your warning
patting it does not disturb your existing makeup.
i truly believe its an instant lifter without the uptight feeling
it has a slightly tacky feel as you pat it into your skin
it's not sticky at all
its basically a drink of water for your skin
not sticky at all!
finally there's a great anti aging product that won't clog pores
the consistency can be kinda thick when you take it out of the jar
it will leave your skin feeling heavy if you don't apply it correctly
there is absolutely nothing out there can hydrate acne-prone skin the way this product does
i recommend applying at night so your skin can drink it in while you sleep
this comes with a little plastic spatula so you don't have to stick your fingers in the pot
ensuring that it doesn't feel greasy on the skin
if you're looking to get a dewy look i'd recommend this
just don't go overboard.
my face doesn't look so dry now
the oil balm does not make my face feel greasy
not only do i wake up dewy
don't expect this to be super heavy.
a lot of korean cosmetics are supposed to be layered so alone it would be ridiculous to make one cream very heavy
even alone it's quite hydrating
doesn't have a strong smell which depends on how you feel about scented creams
not big on the scent
i though this would case my acne prone skin to break out
not slimy since my skin soaks it right up
for those who don't like the dewy look
it does make give your skin that slip feeling that many primers give
it doesn't make my skin greasy
it does make your skin shiny so use with a mattifying primer for day use or put on in the evening
i would say this would work best over damp skin so you can lock in some hydration
this product is an oil that somehow doesn't make my skin feel oily at all
does not feel heavy
does not irritate my skin at all
the only thing i don't care for is when i put this on my lips it leaves a mildly strange taste in my mouth
this does not irritate my skin
maybe consider adding a salicylic acid product into your skin care routine to see if that helps
it didn't make my skin oily or break out.
i don't even need to use a mosturizer afterward like with most serums
or if we've just cleansed their skin
doesn't make you feel dry or sticky
my holy grail so far have been lancôme bi-facile eye makeup remover which i use on the whole face
it's also great about not drying my skin
a quick makeup remover or when i am too lazy to wash my face in the mornings
it does not feel oily or heavy.
no harsh stingy feel or oily feel
if i was too lazy to do so
it's apparent it's more than just water in a bottle
worth the money because it doesn't irritate my skin as other toners have done in the past
when i'm not wearing makeup it is my cleanser
my face doesn't feel clean without it
doesn't leave a film on the skin.
works like a charm to remove things that my cleanser didn't catch
don't wash it off
removes any grime/makeup that i didn't catch with my double cleansing
this is mild enough to use it everyday
it's perfect for removing makeup
i do not even need to wash my face sometimes after cleaning make up with it
i don't actually use it every day because i'd rather use an actual face wash to remove makeup
it has zero scent (yes!).
i want to get my makeup off
whenever i want clean skin
i regularly use this at night when i'm too lazy to wash my face
i don't normally wear foundation or much face makeup
gentle enough to apply on your eyes.
especially for the lazy girl syndrome i've had lately
doesn't leave any weird residue
i still see there's residue on my face
doesn't sting the eyes yet there's no oil
it's water with a cleansing touch.
it removes all make-up without leaving that tacky residue feeling
for reviewers saying that this does not remove makeup well: i recommend using this after you're done with cleansing your face
deally you've already washed off most of what's already on your face
it smells good, and does not irritate my skin.
since a lot of the day's grime tends to gather there for me
it doesn't have a scent which is a huge plus for me
it will remove all your makeup
it never leaves me feeling sticky or like theres any product on my skin
it does not irritate my skin
it doesn't mean i don't like it as a face cleanser
it's just i have a strong personal preference for foamy cleansers
if you wear light makeup like i do
it doesn't do very well with eye makeups
it dispenses the right amount of product: no messy
it's pretty alarming what can still get left behind when you think you've scrubbed everything off—sometimes i end up using more than one cotton pad
i should probably change cleansers
doesn't even sting my eyes
sometimes i follow up with a salicylic toner if it looks like i have a breakout coming on
because makeup remover isn't not something you want to skimp on in terms of how much you're using
this one is gentle enough that i don't need to rinse my face afterwards
for water proof stuff
i usually use it after my shower
doesn't leave any kind of sticky feeling on your face
it doesn't irritate my skin
use this same product on my eyes because it is gentle enough
if my skin feels a little greasy before hand
i don't need to saturate the cotton round to get my makeup off
i dont feel the need to apply a moisturizer right after it
it actually gets all of my makeup off
it leave a slight sticky feel after using it on it's own
it's just fancy water, right?
it does not disturb or cause any stinging or burning to my sensitive
it doesn't sting my eyes or feel greasy in any way like regular eye makeup remover
it doesn't irritate me at all
i don't wash it off when i'm using it as part of my mourning routine as there's less foreign material on my skin
i hate most make up removers because they either 1 don't work or 2 are greasy
sometimes at night i am a little bit lazy.
i still have to wash my face afterwards because this doesn't get into pores on its own
finally a makeup remover that is non irritating that really removes makeup with no harsh chemicals
it somehow cleaned residue out of my pores that i didn't know was still in my pores
i think it would be great for all skin types since it's a magnet for pore-dwelling residue that even really good cleansing doesn't seem to get
my face gets irritated/red really easily
otherwise my face doesn't feel clean
this doesn't irritate or dry me out
i don't know how it's different from other cleansing waters
those things never remove all your makeup
i don't like to wash my face when i still have makeup on
that way i can be sure that my face washing is really penetrating deep into my pores
it doesn't irritate or bother my super sensitive skin anymore than actual water would
it even takes off eye makeup without any sting whatsoever
even though it looks like ordinary water
no matter how thoroughly i think i cleanse my face
doesn't mess with my contacts either
you'd be surprised on how much residue is left on your face even after you've washed it well
it doesn't make it feel greasy
i don't really use it as a make-up remover
but not too thick.
it's a mask i get to use every day
my skin is a little glowy in the summer
now i just need to find a daytime moisturizer that does the same thing
3 oz which is double what u would normally get for any moisturizer
again loving it- hormonal acne being a real beach right now
it doesn't weigh skin down at all
it should be slightly tacky still after you apply it
for whatever reason it made my skin oily
you can't expect every drop to be absorbed
it's just so easy to use.
it's so refreshing to have found a product that can transform the appearance of my skin overnight
it doesn't soak in completely which concerned me at first
if you want skin like a baby's
i like that i can feel it on my skin when i wash my face in the morning because it's a reminder that i've been hydrating all night
i do find it a bit sticky on my face
it literally does work like a corset on my skin
didn't leave a mess all over the pillow
i wonder if the result will remain decent if i don't pair the mask with the serum?
now i'm curious to try the black tea cream too.
its the only mask i have ever found that doesn't irritate my skin after use
you can get a lot of use out of one jar.
it didn't feel greasy or oily
if you travel pack this you'll underst
i don't notice much of a scent so that's also a plus
although i don't know if i need a firming mask
the mask is not sticky at all
i love what it does for my wrinkles
i wonder if fresh knows that it can actually heal poison ivy
the jar lasts quite a while .
not only does it moisturize my skin during the night
ready for me to apply my bb/cc cream without feeling like there's too much on my skin
i didn't like some of the ingredients such as the corn oil
not use it under makeup
24 with acne prone skin- i have been terrified of heavy creams on my skin because it never ends well for me
it's not meant to be put on thick
it did not clog my pores
so a generous amount doesn't mean to slather your entire face with it
it just melts into your skin
don't put on a lot of the cream because it can cause acne
everyone i have tried in the past is either too oily
i can see how it may be a bit heavy for those with acne prone skin
i don't find it messy to use
then you shouldn't have issues with it getting all over your pillow
it's not supposed to be lathered on like a clay mask
i can't really pin down the transformations to my skin
if i can find a smaller jar i intend to scoop some out with a plastic spoon to keep it fresher
is that it leaves the skin looking quite greasy after application even though it's not greasy to the touch
f you a are a little older with real wrinkles
as they tend to disappear after i moisturize my skin
love this product can be irritating to eyes
the microdelivery peel works so
i never expect anything with these wrinkle creams
you can't even see a single wrinkle
i can't tell you how well this works long term at getting rid of wrinkles
doesn't dry or irritate my sensitive skin either.
my mother who does not wear makeup periods
try it for yourself
i don't care for skin care that leaves my skin tacky feeling
i find it comical from the comments where people have used half a bottle
the smell isn't that bad either
i love the menthol cooling effect to as it helps with puffiness i only gave it a 4 because it's not perfect
while it does help me it's just to expensive
sometimes i stil see the fine lines around my mouth
nothing actually gets rid of lines
you want your face to be as smooth as a baby's
it's not a cheap product.
it does seem to make the 11's disappear for a short while
creases are tightened after using this altho it doesn't last all day
since i can't afford the botox right now
it's still look smooth
i do not have deep set wrinkles in my smile lines
this product doesn't irritate my
make sure you only use it where botox would go
is that it kind of stings
it's now part of my skin care routine
it's not going to instantly evaporate your wrinkles
i like that it's not greasy
not expect it to completely erase wrinkles
however, it does lesson lines and wrinkles.
it doesn't pop up when you pump out product
it's just like applying the mud mask
that cleanser wasn't helping my skin as much
but it's the cleanser!
what does bug me is that it turns out glam glow is not cruelty free
i barely get oily anymore
not bad maybe a few pimples.
cleanse my skin on super lazy nights
although if you have dry skin this might not be the best product as it does tend to remove most of the oils from your skin
can happily say that i have found the perfect cleanser for my super sensitive
i really notice a different in my skins complexion as well as it looking less clogged with blackheads
the only downside that i see to this cleanser is that i can't really use it at the end of my shower like i usually do because it needs to be applied to a dry face
even if i skip a day or two with this cleanser my skin doesn't go crazy like it used to
if this product has the tendency to sting or be harsh
i don't think it overly dries out my face
i will say that because it starts as a charcoal color
if you love that mask
who gets an occasional breakout here
idk if it's good for oily or dry skin because i have neither
it doesn't perform any mattifying miracles
maybe they're redoing it since it's on sale
that's when i usually get acne around the chine
not only does it make my skin matte
i started getting bad hormonal breakouts out of no where
it's plenty gentile enough to use twice a day.
because this is the only cleanser to ever take care of my ance without drying my face out
believe me even though it is a bit expensive you'll get an other bottle after
this stuff works like magic with my curology prescription
i couldn't imagine using any other cleanser
like my pores are tightening maybe?
i do not find it dries my skin
normally i'm bad about cleansing my face
i think this would be good for oily skin
i don't have bad acne/pimples
this moisturizer does not make my face shiny at all
so don't wear anything you favor because if got on clothes it will stain
first the gritty texture usually does not make my skin happy
it's become apart of my skin care routine
the only cleanser that has gotten rid of my acne is proactiv
if your skin is like mine
gets rid of annoying little pimples over night
cleans your skin like no other
i've had annoying acne on my jawline for about 3 months now that wouldn't go away
get a little lazy some nights
my only issue is the pump it's gotten clogged
youll get a refreshing feeling i use a scrub on my face face instead of using my h
i never thought i'd see the day because my skin is super oily
it doesn't leave a tight feeling like other products
for having dry skin i can get awfully shiny with certain cleansers
i usually switch up my cleansers often for the next best thing
i cannot even put into words what this cleanser did to my skin
you can literally feel that it's cleaning your pores while you are rubbing it on your skin
the smell doesn't linger too long
it's a more intense oil
it does have a strong smell you'll have to get used to
it's not a greasy oil
the only bad thing is the pump sticks
it's very annoying that a product that costs this much has such a horrible pump
pump squirts too hard though
wouldn't use this as a make up remover
it's it the only oil that nourish your skin without leaving any greasy residue
no greasy feeling at all
why spoil it with a cheap
my only complaint i think would be the pump: it dispenses waaay more than you need to actually remove your makeup
a half pump usually does the trick.
they all make me worry that either my pore will be clogged
which is something i've always had no matter what i used to cleanse
i don't have to layer tons of moisturizer anymore
even though it's pricey i am saving money because i've been able to use much less moisturizer since i started cleansing with this tata harper oil
the pump doesn't work.
i prefer using this if i feel like it will really get on my skin or to do a facial massage
you don't even need a cloth
it's stuck until you push really hard then squirts out too much product
i like other eye makeup removers just fine
it even removes benefit's they're real mascara which is not easy to do
nourishing that you don't want to waste it on removing makeup
i usually stay away from cleansers that say purifying as i find them too drying on my skin
not your typical strip the skin cleanser
my skin doesn't feel stripped after use.
a great options when you want a wet face cleanser that isn't full of sulfates
do not use to remove eye makeup as it will sting your eyes
doesn't leave my skin tight after washing my face
i don't use this to remove makeup
i also feel like it doesn't strip the skin while cleansing
with this being in a glass bottle alot of product gets left unused because you can't get it out
it doesn't get all my makeup off since i used my toner afterwards
doesn't leave your skin stripped of moisture
this won't remove your makeup
it's a nightly must for me.
it doesn't strip the skin which is great
if you into foamy cleansers this is not for you
i don't get those monthly zits
it's not a foamy cleanser
it's definitely not a milky one either
it's almost gel-like
note-this won't remove makeup
i don't allow it to suds up on my skin at all
non-congested skin i don't think this would be good
it's a different type of cleanser
it does a good job cleaning the skin without stripping it
it's an expensive cleanser
so don't waste product by having super wet h
once you work it around your skin it turns very oily
if you like heavy
the only thing that is annoying is that is too sticky
you cannot treat your skin if you have a layer of make up on
this is not to remove makeup.
i feel like it's kept breakouts at bay
even oil based cleansers have made my skin feel stripped
t doesn't feel drying to my skin
i wouldn't use this to remove makeup or around the eyes
whatever ones she uses work for my skin
i always use a cleansing oil before using makeup at night
it doesn't feel heavy or clog my pores.
i don't even care for the scent.
it wasn't too oily
a word to the wise: try not to get it on your lips because it tastes awful
does not clog my poresdries quicklyno scentgood moisture
i also love the smell once it's rubbed in to your face
i do not like the heavy feeling of creams
it can 'flake' if i rub my skin after applying
doesn't add a bunch of shine like most do
this stuff goes on so smoothe
it does not irritate my skin at all.
doesn't leave my face greasy
i can smell it even after i apply it to my face
it smells really gross
doesn't leave a greasy feel behind
not greasy at all
have these little bumps under my skin that you can't pop
i think it's been lightening my freckles
when it's time to put it on i have a scent of old rags-_- i hope it's not just me :
it's substantial enough that it lasts all day
doesn't leave my skin feeling oily or greasy feeling
so refeshing when you put it on and not oily!!
doesn't make my face look oily
it's thick enough to cover well with just a little
it's the perfect product for my oily
doesn't leave your face feeling oily.
doesn't leave a film or excess grease
doesn't leave me with a greasy feel
i don't expect miracles from cream in a jar
does not leave an oily or slick feeling on the skin
hope in a jar has made me less scared of face moisturizers
look for a light product that doesn't leave my face greasy
doesn't make me oily which is hard to find
is not in the least bit heavy or greasy
i can't believe how amazing this lotion is!
doesn't make you sweat from clogging pores
doesn't have a terrible smell
it's a nice light moisturizer day or night
didn't make me feel oily
because it does look a little dewey
this doesn't leave me oily
a lot of people say it burns
that's probably because you're scrubbing your face too hard
or if i exfoliate my face too hard
it doesn't moisturize as much as i need
it never feels greasy or heavy
it leaves my skin feeling super soft that i do not want to use anything on top
it does wonders on my combination/acne prone skin
the only thing is that i either have to add more layers or put another deep moisturizer on top because it doesn't moisture as much as i want it to
isn't one of those lotions that soaks right up
don't really have wrinkles or dark under eyes
it's a little pricey for the size
i will say that keeping the area moisturized allows my makeup to better do it's job
isn't so thick that i get more puffy
this is one of the few eye creams that i didn't find irritating
not irritate the eye area
i don't notice a smell or a tingly sensation that other people have mentioned
i do not have puffiness
don't waste your 100 points on the perk being offered it's outrageously tiny if i was the size of a smurf it would be enough:/ the perk size is shockingly miniature
maybe like a slight mentholated feel that i find very refreshing
even oily skin can use this as well since oil products actually can help the skin produce less oil
i can't use during the summer
it's so easy to remove
how much it's softened my skin
i probably won't include it in my morning routine because my skin gets oily throughout the day
i tried this on a whim after some research suggesting that an oil cleanser can balance oil that causes acne
it makes double sure i don't go to bed with contaminants or impurities on my skin since i also work in an er where bacteria floats around all day
i usually use it in the morning or as a second cleanse because i don't feel like it totally gets my waterproof mascara off
it doesn't leave an oily film on my skin
a little hard to wash off because of its oil texture
didn't break me out or irritate my skin.
i do use three pumps as i noticed two wasn't enough to get rid of my mascara
or sometimes i do a mask.
it's a whole nighttime thing.
this is the only oil based cleanser that gets all my makeup off
i wear a full face of makeup most days so need something to really cleanse my face thoroughly
there is a bit of trouble with mascara
it does melts away your makeup
my skin didn't feel stripped or have a oil residue
i want my cleanser to simply 1
i don't know why it's so difficult to find a cleanser that delivers
i usually use it with a facecloth
especially when nothing in my skin care routine could deal with pimples
i typically buy wipes of some kind
it does not leave your face the least bit oily
the idea of using an oil cleanser sounded crazy
it really does melt off even thick foundation.
i gave it a shot figuring i had nothing to lose since i saw the video saying using oil on oily/semi oily skin could help
i would recommend this to anyone who has combination skin to dry skin to wanting something luxurious feeling on their face at the end of the night
not only it cleans.
my face does not have redness like it was
i also find that you don't have to rub your lashes too hard
it makes removing everything sooo easy.
i didn't think an oil on a dry face would remove all my makeup
does not make my acne flare up
you get the hint
it does not leave a sticky feel
you don't feel that dried out feeling you get from a lot of cleansers
i wear full coverage makeup so tried this cleansing oil
i love it cause my cleanser doesnt have to do so much work removing makeup
i don't know if it's good at removing eye makeup or not bc i use bioderma first to remove my eye makeup
can work really well to remove this mascara
use this as a makeup remover as i blindly used this in the shower
i also don't feel like it would remove the makeup products that i prefer to use
it's smooth it out
for me this does not replace my my cleansing routine it's just an addition to it
one of the many issues i tend to run into with oil cleansers is that they don't wash away as cleanly as i like
i don't do liquid eyeliner much so perhaps that is where the complaint is from
even when i wear a cat eye
it did not remove my makeup as good as micellar water does
i've never been super big on the oil cleaning method just because i feel that my nighttime routine takes much longer when using a cleansing oil
though i don't wear a lot of makeup
which isn't the case with any other oil cleansers i've tried
know my skin will be ok then worry about rashes
it's oil-- which breakdowns the makeup on the surface
i never liked the oil remover products that you have to wipe away cause it feels icky
if you're someone like me who hates washing their face because it's super time consuming then you'll probably like this product
i don't know that this cleansing oil is a miracle-worker for my complexion
doesn't irritate my skin or my eyes
this is the first oil i've tried that didn't leave some sort of film on my skin after rinsing
kinda like a beauty oil instead of using it to cleanse?
it's way too thick with foundation it separates badly
i am just curious as to if it's safe to leave on the skin since it says rinse
i never liked cleansing oils until this one.
the texture of it when you're massaging it into your skin isn't even oily like you would expect it to be
it doesn't leave a greasy residue after you wash it off
1 or 2 drops is enough
does not strip my skin
i don't wear makeup a lot
this stuff is pricey
it doesn't irritate my skin
clean without irritating it
saw that it wasn't cleaning my skin enough
would get it realy clean before i put an ointment on it
i happen to love oil cleansers because i feel that they do not strip my face of my oil reserves that i so desperately need
i don't wear makeup everyday
it's safe to say this is my new holy grail skin care item
there's absolutely no oily residue left behind
it doesn't sting or anything
it's always been kind of messy
wonderful product if your skin isn't heavily oily to begin with
i do need to use 2 pumps to really remove all my makeup
it takes off all of my makeup easily
don't be afraid if you have oily skin.
t doesn't feel greasy
there is always makeup residue on it if i use this product alone
love that this cleanser does the job in just one product
it takes less than 10 seconds to remove my stubborn waterproof mascara as well as my foundation
you don't use a lot so bonus you don't need to purchase as often
not the greasy ugly one
so simple you don't even have to add water.
and so gentle i can even use it on eyes.
not only did this cleanse
it doesn't have much of a scent it is perfect for my sensitive skin
love how it doesn't have a sticky oily residue or feel
i do not use the oil since things look a little greasy
i swear it helps *control* the oil production that i otherwise struggle with
you don't look greasy
have not left my combo skin feeling or looking oily at all
using this oil has helped my face a lot while not irritating my skin
oil has the tendency to also make you feel greasy afterwards
this oil actually helps to stop my skin from overproducing excess oil of it's own
but they just left my face feeling super greasy.
i don't really have any wrinkles
i know it's not marketed in any way as making your eyelashes grow
it's even great for mixing with matte foundations for a more dewy effect
this may not be for everyone as everyone's chemical makeup is different
you'll realize that it's a great product
i literally can't stop touching my face!
it has little to no smell and isn't thick.
i normally do my face routine
hate the greasy feeling
is not greasy at all
while this oil hasn't made my skin matte by any means it's noticeably less slick
absorbs quickly and doesn't leave skin greasy.
the makeup doesn't cake up
it doesn't transfer once it settles into the skin
it doesn't leave you super greasy
you can add extra later if you want a bit more sheen
if you don't want an oily look
it does not clog my pores.
it's not oily whatsoever
it has no smell and of course it's really light.
will make you look like an oil slick
oils usually break me out
i don't know if it's only psychological
doesn't need much in the way of extra moisture
it's a must in my skin are regime.
most oils don't sink in
it's not so thick and not so watery.
normally oil makes me feel greasy
my skin is super prone to break outs
i noticed i'm not quite as oily
doesn't leave your face greasy ... which i love!
i don't notice a smell at all either.
doesn't clog your pores
my skin doesn't feel gross
i didn't incorporate any de moisturizers into my routine at that time because they are pretty expensive
i've found it's light enough to wear under makeup as well
if i ever have a skin irritation i use this oil
this was way way too sticky
however it's not as bad as it used to be so my fear of creating oilier skin was unfounded
doesn't feel heavy like other night time moisturizers i've used
even so, i do get the occasional pimple.
it is not greasy
didn't seem to absorb well
the oil wasn't heavy like the others
i doesn't feel oily
the only thing about this product that is inaccurate is that it absolutely leaves an oily or greasy residue
it doesn't break me out at all so what i do is just put this over the night serum sleep in it
no balling up like other stuff.
am not very oily anymore
i think the oil is just two heavy on my pores.
at first it has a nutty sort of scent when i drop it into my palm
i loveeee using this stuff on nights i'm not using a sleeping mask
it's supposed to be fragrance free
it is a real challenge to find something that doesn't cause closed comedones
can't wait to have them all part of my daily skin routine
some didn't entirely sink in/absorb
it's the same product
though i can see how it may make oily skin too greasy leading to breakouts
my hand was like legit glowing.
it doesn't have any overwhelming scent to it.
this will change your skin care routine!!!
fyi if you have any open nicks/pics spots on your face
if you turn bright red from the glycolic it's because you're using something else that has sensitized your skin
while i rarely get whiteheads anymore
they don't have any color
read/tell myself it was all part of the purging process blah blah
this isn't a bad product.
i thunk this would be perfect for oily skin as my oily areas seem to react well to this
it doesn't smell and sinks in right away.
since i started using drunk elephant i don't have redness that much
using this product every night doesn't burn or irritate my skin
maybe my skin got little worst loll
i don't even wear foundation or powder anymore
don't have wrinkles yet
i actually wear less makeup because i'm loving my skin
you gotta wear a moisturiser over this serum because it is not meant to be used on it's own
it's helped with my acne scars plus totally cleared all the bumps i had on my forehead that i couldn't get rid
i looked like the smoothing filter on snapchat i am not even exaggerating lol
started getting these little annoying breakouts again
i don't experience much texture
wasn't a fan of the slimy feel on my skin
congestion in my skin i make sure i wash
i no longer get oily
this product does so well controlling my oily face
it doesn't help a bunch so far with acne
it makes your face just super fresh
let's start with my skins background story:- insanely acne prone
i did notice when i used it straight on my face after washing it did cause irritation so make sure your skin is dry
can get away without using a primer if i moisturize really well
not only has it made my skin oh so soft
yes sticky a bit but benefits outweigh the con.
it dosnt absorb into my skin it kinda leaves my face feeling sticky
it definitely feels sticky on your face
it's so smooth to the touch.
typically skin care just doesn't excite me too much
can't wait to try it out on my arms as well since i have keratosis
i can barely see my pores
i also don't break out as often
idk if it's due to this or because i stopped wearing makeup so often
i even tried to use the ordinary's aha serum instead because it's so much cheaper
i've tried so many products in an attempt to get rid of texture
mostly i find no tingle with application
it has gotten rid of all my zits
you shouldn't expect for one product to fix your skin over one night
if you get bumps
pimples on the area you normally break out
i never thought that my pores could vanish!
50% of my pores on one area shrinked so much that they are not visible anymore
i don't notice that this is too drying even if i don't use a moisturizer
t doesn't help treat existing pimples
don't let the price tag keep you away from this amazing serum
'm still able to spot treat with retin-a when a pimple starts to appear
the results were so were noticeable that my plastic surgeon who does my botox asked me to write the name of whatever i was using down for her own use
no blackheads you can see
i would 100% recommend this product especially to those who suffer from texture probs
i rarely get skin flare ups
i do get the occasional hormonal break out
glowy until using this product
mostly hormonal acne that never come to anything except texture
it's convenient for travel
it doesn't strip my skin
it's nothing like using a bar of soap.
this is not a traditional "soap" bar as it does not contain the typical lye
you will not experience the stripping or that soapy residue fee that accompanies most barsl
it's just a bar of soap: it cleans
this is the first bar of soap i've ever used that doesn't strip my skin of moisture
doesn't leave me with that tight
isn't irritating at all
the only drawback is that it doesn't get all eye make up off so you still need eye make up remover
it's one of the few cleansers i've tried that doesn't leave my skin really tight
it's really not messy at all
it was just super unlike other bar cleanser.
to me it simply smells "clean"
you need to lather the cleansing bar enough
i didn't want to dish out all that cash since it's on the pricey side
my face doesn't feel stripped or tight after cleansing
ingredients can get fancy
i hate it sometimes when i try something new zits will appear
i just don't like the fact it's a bar because of sanitary reasons
i love this product because it's a great basic cleanser that doesn't leave your skin feel tight or dry
doesn't strip the skin
this soap really lathers up with so little use
doesn't irritate my skin
it's gentle enough to use morning
doesn't leave my face feeling super dry after use like other cleansers do
this "soap" has not bothered my skin at all
the cheap cardboard box is messy and annoying.
it's not drying at all
manages to gets all of my makeup off
and i still get acne sometimes.
it doesn't irritate my eyes
i am usually not a face soap person because i find leathering up your facial wash is troublesome when you can just squeeze them out from a tube instead
it doesn't really leather much
instead it's a very milky formula
the little milky bubbles go away very fast
i actually see this face wash really working into cleansing my pore
i can see all the pores are so clean
it doesn't burn my eyes
though i find that it's very similar to the juju bar minus the exfoliation
i didn't feel super ugly
make sure to store it/ let it dry on a soap dish so none of the product goes to waste
i saw a few reviews with people complaining that it doesn't get bubbly
even though it's a soap
t kind of just turns into a milk without any real foaming/bubbles
it's almost like having two cleansers in one.
once i learned that balancing my ph levels was the cure for my oily
i can say that it's a good cleanser
the pekee bar however is a bit more gentle as it does not have the exfoliating bits in it
not a soapy one from this product
use just enough water on my face to rinse it off so there's no visible soap
i made the mistake of rubbing my face to hard when rinsing which made my face feel "squeaky clean" which i didn't want
just don't get it in your eyes
it does burn a bit
it's gentle yes effective.
my face does not feel dried out after using this bar
this stuff doesn't smell
doesn't feel slick or greasy
this one truly does not strip or dry the skin.
normally i hate bar soaps
this bar + a washcloth gets rid of pretty much all my makeup
that tend to irritate my skin if i use it regularly
both the bars are so refreshing on the skin
i couldn't believe i was trying a soap style cleanser
yet somehow manages to remove all of my makeup without stripping my skin
it's actually improved my combination acne prone skin
i just want something that removes my grime at the end of the day
cleansers that are too emollient never agree with me anyway
the only thing is that it does strip my spray tan rather quickly
as long as you don't feel it drying your face on like the 3rd or 4th cleanse
flakey on my chin that i decided to give a new product a try
i do not use soap on my skin
there is no scent and does not cause redness.
foamy on your face which is something i like
not only does my skin feel soothed
i suppose you could also just brush your clarisonic over the soap bar
you don't want your soap to sit in water
even though i love bar cleansers
oh, and it takes off makeup very effectively!
doesn't leave a film or make my face dry
it doesn't stink with added perfumes
sometimes i even skip that
even those with eczema as it didn't irritate my skin condition
this cleanser doesn't make my skin feel tight
it's literally the first cleanser i have ever used that doesn't make my skin feel tight or dry afterwards
it's made all the difference
it's hard finding a cleanser that isn't super harsh
by nature, i have bad skin.
i get acne so often
although if you wear stubborn mascara you might need another eye makeup remover
this line doesn't contain any fragrance at all
my skin feels simply clean
my skin didn't feel "stripped" after cleansing
there's no weird or over-powering scent
makeup without leaving a filmy feeling or a tight feeling
it doesn't smell at all.
it's nice and gentle and does not strip the skin.
wouldn't think of using any other product to clean my face
that it doesn't leave a film on my face like other bar soaps
like there's a film on your face
it never dries out my skin or irritates
does not irritate or make your skin feel dry
it's very easy to travel with or throw in a gym bag
it's hard not to have outkast playing in your head after washing with the juju bar
it's a smooth lather than feels like clay at the same time
peekee doesn't leave my skin feeling quite as clean
don't overuse (like i did).
it's definitely less oily
it's fine around my nose
i think of that awful squeaky-clean feeling
i think they're going to be my new cleansers from now on
it does not leave your skin feeling tight like a normal soap bar
it's exfoliating, but not too much.
after you wash your face it feels sooo smooth
or you can literally rub the bar on your face for direct exfoliation
it doesn't even leave your face feeling that tight dryness after some exfoliants
i noticed it didn't irritate my skin or worsen my acne
it's great for traveling since it's not a liquid
it's not showing any signs of wear
it's a pro at removing makeup
i didn't notice a bit of dryness around my nose
my skin lost it's mind
"do i lather it up
realized that the bar was doing it's job by bringing impurities to the surface
t doesn't feel like i am over-exfoliating
in a good way not an oily way
tend to break out so easily
it's probably touched my face
natural being that it's not full of chemicals
it's not drying at all
feel strange about using a 'bar" cleanser
i can't believe i'm spending this much on a cleanser
this maybe better suited for everyday use on someone with combo to oily skin
they're the only cleansers i've tried that get sudsy
i think it's the way the company worded it that is causing confusion
i will never use any cleansers other than juju bar
don't rub this soap on your face, though!
sometimes i use it with my boscia sponge other times i just use my h
no matter how many times i used this in the day it doesn't dry out my skin or make my face feel tight
completely gets rid of the tiny little flakes of dry skin on my face if i have any
the peekee bar are the only soaps that i've use that don't make my eyelash extensions fall out
is not too abrasive if you work the product into your h
i hope it is not damaging to my skin
if not i lather it in my h
if anything it has helped calm some existing buggers
it is a little scratchy when you put it directly on your skin
i find my skin does ok with direct contact to the bar except it hurts a bit on my forehead
'll rub it on my h
i decided to try this because it's non stripping on the skin
don't have to buy a soap dish like i thought
changing your face wash can be either a hit or miss i feel
sometimes i think it's because our skin can develop intolerance for something
i really like that when i lather between my h
to make sure i remove all makeup
i like using it like this better because when i just use the lather it doesn't feel as exfoliating
the only thing is that it's hard to find a spot to put it after i'm done using it because it's a wet bar of soap that sticks to the counter if i leave it there
then apply only the lather to your face
if you are finding this too abrasive i can imagine it is possibly from rubbing the bar on your face
it does not strip the skin nor does it leave behind any residue
this is really more skin care than it is makeup remover
it has somehow made them less annoying
i will say tho the exfoliating beads or whatever is in this bar are very harsh
i kind of wish they made the bar with out the exfoliation that's why i took off 1 star
the only thing i don't like is that it has an odd smell
my face doesn't stay matte all day
it's not the oil slick it used to be
it's transformed my very acne
i would suggest not putting the bar directly on your face as it is pretty abrasive
not a hint of over-stripping that usually accompanies bar soap
not clearing any of my acne
treat your skin to what it needs
because it's a dryer oil
it doesn't feel heavy on my skin which i personally dislike
i recommend this to even you combo/oily girls
you can feel how abrasive this bar is
if i do to much to it it can get super dry or super oily it never seems to be ok until my daily routine with this soap
that you'll have for the rest of your life
this tends to be at night to get the makeup
doesn't feel greasy or turn your face into an oil slick
i even make my own serums
during the day i find the elixir a little too heavy with my makeup
seems to make even the chalkiest bb cream
do not mix with moisturizer so the product can really sink into your skin
don't feel greasy at all
dessicated mess if it weren't for caudelie
it's treating every aging concern
t is good to still use with a moisturizer
doesn't even feel like an oil and sinks right in.
if you are scared about oils this is a must try oil
it doesn't feel as tight
is somehow less oily during the day
this cleanser is literally so bomb like i went it for something i could actually wash my face with cuz i don't really have any facial cleansers
does not strip my skin
it foams just enough
any type of face wash makes my face burn
t feels like it's really getting in the pores
it's just an all around need to have face wash
it's the only cleanser i use
i like how it cleans
this stuff never irritates my skin or generates breakouts
from the moment you start to cleanse your face you will see how soft
there's not smell to it
so when i started to use this product the occasional pimple or some acne that used to show up didn't occur as frequently
i love how you can remove eye make up with it too
using this i don't feel like there is any makeup residue leftover on my face
which irritates my face badly
the only thing i dislike about it is if it is your only cleanser that you use you start to get a build up in your eyebrows where it doesn't completely rinse away
t doesn't dry out or irritate my skin
it actually helped to get rid of a lot of my redness
it's gentle enough to not over strip my skin's natural oils
it doesn't cause any irritation
it's definitely a staple in my skin regime
it lathers just enough.
as a personal preference i don't like too much lather because those seem to make my combo/oily skin dry
it now seems that its the only cleanser that doesn't give me an allergic reaction
it's hard to put my finger on it
it doesn't leave my skin feeling uncomfortable or irritated
my skin tone is even
love this cleanser it's gentle on my skin does not burn my eyes
it's very foamy does not dry out skin or give you that tight feeling after you wash your face which i hate
does a good job of removing my eye makeup.
when i'm lazy this is all i'll do
i also love foam, can't get enough.
removed my eye makeup without giving me raccoon eyes after which most cleaners tend to do
it doesn't smell soapy at all.
if you prefer the super clean feeling
it does foam up
doesn't burn my eyes to take my makeup off.
didn't really add much moisturize
doesn't leave it feeling tight after washing
doesn't clog my pores or break me out
i also love how it's thick, yet foaming.
i feel like a cleanser that doesn't foam also doesn't clean your face very well
it's very hard to find a cleanser that removes your makeup
yet doesn't leave your skin feeling like it has an oil layer after washing
it does not make my skin oily nor does it dry it out
since i use this face wash it doesn't weigh down my face or makes me look tired my face h
doesn't irritate my rosacea
nice for the morning when you don't need a deep cleanse
doesn't dry out my skin or anything.
a little goes a long way so this isn't a cleanser requiring a gob of product to get the job done
this cleanser doesn't do that
i normally just use my tatcha oil cleanser
there's no strong sent
t's not irritating to my skin
i break out sometimes
doesn't make my skin feel squeaky or dry
can't imagine finding a cleanser i like more.
otherwise harm my skin
i can't stop feeling how soft my face is
fragrance as these both can irritate the skin so this may not be gentle for everyone
why add something that strips your skin so badly
it cleanses enough to get my makeup off
it doesn't make my skin feel dry at all.
it doesn't make my oily skin feel
it's the perfect every day face wash
it's simple but gets the job done.
when i first tried this i didn't think it has enough cleansing power since it feels very creamy
it doesn't foam much
i felt like it doesn't give me that clean feeling i get with my previous cleansers
if you like that squeaky clean feeling
this does not make me feel more oily
nor do i care for the greasy feeling after i rinse
occasionally i follow up with a cream remover if i don't want to scrub too much
some cleansers are terrible when they get in your mouth
this cleanser doesn't really foam
i don't usually spend this much on face washes
there is no lingering makeup or dirt
which doesn't help my acne
i don't exactly feel "cleansed" after i use it
she insisted my skin didn't need a product to dry up my pimples
doesn't irritate my eyes at all
i don't wear waterproof makeup though
it's gentle enough that it doesn't irritate my eyes
love the way this cleanser does its job!
doesn't strip my skin
most foam cleansers leave my skin feeling so tight i can't h
and it doesn't irritate my eyes
it doesn't dry me out but helps combat my pores.
it's the perfect balance of everything i need out of a cleanser
like it's heavy in weight in my hand.
this is nice because there's no need for excessive scrubbing or rubbing or pulling
some water gives enough foam to wash my entire face
this doesn't break me out or irritate my skin since it is very gentle
$3 exfoliant huge mistake don't do this to yourself ever ppl
i dont depend on it for eye makeup removal because it stings
no matter how much i try to exfoliate
it doesn't leave my skin feeling dry whatsoever
i am not a fan of foaming cleanser as they tend to run down my arms when i wash
i don't wear makeup a lot
it's not the best at removing water-proof mascara
it's not good in removing eye makeup
it'll help brighten your skin
it's wonderful at breaking down makeup- even waterproof mascara
i simply rub it into my typically fully made-up face
it does leave a bit of residue
it's not very bothersome
it is not greasy
i usually end up with a cleanser that is too rich
this stuff is gentle enough to off my tons of eye makeup without harmign my eyes
it doesn't have a strong smell
which is usually a problem for me
it's very gentle and doesn't really foam much.
the only downside is that it doesn't really removed eye makeup like it says
the only downside is it doesn't remove eye makeup well
it doesn't even take much to wash your face.
that is alright with me cause i use balms away for my eye remover
most all eye make up removers i have tried either don't remove my favorite mascara
doesn't cause my eyes to act up
doesn't burn my eyes
it is so easy to wash off
it doesn't dry my skin out or add unnecessary oils at all
since it doesn't foam
there's no chance of drying out
i don't normally have puffy eye issues or dark circles
otherwise you don't get a well mixed product
the application is a little annoying
this somehow made my eyes look less gag _immediately_
i can't speak to the product's other claims of brightening
great for getting rid of puffiness after nights of too many margaritas
have used soooo many products for puffy eyes an dark circles
kinda rude on their part
even though its pricey it doesn't take much of the product to calm the puffiness
this stuff is unlike any other "eye cream"
although i don't have very puffy eyes
i don't have too much puffiness
for some reason some concealer a tend to be a little too drying under my eyes
what's more is you can even dab it
don't put on my concealer without it now.
that is what sold me- i tend to put on heavy concealer to cover the dark circles
it's more of a makeup product.
it really made my cakey under eyes makeup goes away
it's tightens the skin under the eyes
doesn't actually reduce puffiness
the ironing tip is truly the magic
that must be why my under eyes are kinda stinging
i wasn't excited about this since puffiness isn't usually an issue for me
if you are looking to only cover puffy eyes this product is for you
use it the way it's meant to be used or it can get clumpy
the "iron" tip is kind of superfluous
i tend to get puffy eyes sometimes after having contacts in for a good part of the day
want minamize that puffy look
it's not for dark circles
if you need to get rid of puffiness this is a great product
immediately rub it in it doesn't give the peptides
does tingle a little that's just the peptides working
i don't put it on my eye lid however b/c i feel like it irritates it
use of an eye cream is mostly irrelevant
as whatever your moisturizer does to the other skin on your face
this is not an eye cream.
i love it because i don't like wearing heavy concealer
i find it fills in the creases so that my concealer doesn't crease on top of it
doesn't burn like a lot of other under eye products
i love this even when i don't use the sonic device
i can't even count how many $ i've spent on eye creams
doesn't seem to work too well in ironing out puffiness
it's great for touch ups during the day when you want that little lift
you didn't get a lot of sleep or are hungover
its almost like i can feel my undereyes being de-puffed
reduced the puffy bags i would get sometimes
it's called puff off.
smoothing out wrinkles which is exactly what it does
it's also perfect for days when you don't wear makeup
there's a slight cooling sensation that doesn't irritate
it doesn't feel or leave my under eyes oily which is awesome
it doesn't disturb it or wipe it off
i still get breakouts
which i spot treat with benzoyl peroxide since they're those deep
i didn't have to scrub hard or leave a moisturizer that bothered my skin on all day
the flakey skin is gone
usually not a fan of mask
didn't leave any residue
didn't make my face greasy like most masks have a tendency to do on combination skin
it amebas you can splash this on with out any messyit sucks right into your skin
doesn't give me any redness
doesn't leave my skin greasy or too shiny
doesn't get greasy by the end of the day
i typically don't splurge that much on face wash
it doesn't clean nearly as well
i wasn't sure i would like this since when i was rinsing my face i noticed the squeaky clean feeling which isn't my favorite at all
my skin didn't have that "tight" feeling one sometimes gets after washing
it didn't feel drying either
good for all skin types even oily.
you'll need to make sure to be properly matched to the right sonic brush though
anything with any trace of fragrance will give me an allergic reaction all over my face
almost always removes all my water proof mascara
i imagine this would be even better with the fancy cleaning brush
my makeup off without irritating my skin
it's just a very solid face wash that doesn't have tons of fluffy ingredients that cause negative reactions
it's simple, and it works.
it does not strip my face of nature oils
i simply got tired of using that obnoxious bar of soap on face
strips every bit of makeup in one try
i love how it helps with the clarisonic glide over your face
this does not and makes it a breeze to clen.
the soap doesn't spray all over the place when i use this
and the soap doesn't slide off my face.
i love how it lathers up
feels clean, doesn't take much to lather up.
the feeling dissipates after a few moments or when i apply moisturizer
there's no scent and it lathers up great!
not to mention acne medication i use that has left my skin dull
this oil is something you should absolutely invest in if you have dry skin
the dropper does not reach the bottom of the bottle
my skin just doesn't look the same when i am not using this serum
while it does leave your face feeling like it's glowing
my face becomes so matte
i feel like it doesn't interfere with any of my other skin care or makeup
f i put make up on while it's not 100% dry
which i don't find spreads as easily as you might hope
even out my skin tone
you can wear it without makeup
i wouldn't wear it at night
it's made a difference in my skin.
can't tolerate anything on my face that smells like chemicals
can't really tell you if this makes my skin softer or reduces pore size or whatever
what i can tell you is that this is the only product i've found that helps with my oily skin
it didn't the texture: it felt to heavy for my oily skin
it's a multi tanker that will not leave you oily at all
well, i hate the moisturizer- it breaks me out.
that it dries pretty quick without making my face greasy or shiny
i like how it doesn't dry me out either.
it doesn't make my skin more oily or grease at all
it's supposed to treat problem skin
when you don't need a moisturizer, this is it!
i can wear less makeup
however i like matchy-matchy
love this product except a bit pricey.
doesn't make it oily
my easy to please teenage skin has turned into a mystery
it's made my skin look brighter
it does not make me oily
i noticed that my skin wasn't absorbing my moisturizer as well as it used to
this serum doesn't leave any residue or leave me shiny at all
it doesn't help with my oily problem
doesn't leave my t-zone feeling oily
doesn't leave any weird residue
acne isn't as big of an issue as it used to be
i don't have acne issues
i can't say that i see any huge difference in my skin looking smoother or having blurred out pores
i hope it's not this because this serum allows me to go without primer
i love that it doesn't make my make-up look greasy or shiny
it was a little sticky which i don't mind
use it when my skin needs a drink
i leave it on for 10-15 minutes or until i feel my face get kinda itchy/tingly
because everyone's skin type is different
it doesn't leave my face with a glow like it says
your skin will feel like it's
i absolutely love the 24k gold mask as well as quite a few of the other ptr masks
the product itself is a little bit goopy going on
it didn't feel heavy
is not heavy once it's applied
it doesn't irritate my skin
you need this mask!
not to overly toot my own ingenuity
the skin doesn't feel dry either.
i like how it's thick
i like that it doesn't get hard or tight like the glamglow
i don't think it shrinks pores
i think it's great for drawing out pimples
the feel of the actual mask is a smooth cold gel like form that glides on your face at the black color you see in the jar
absolutely love this mask- i have combination skin that occasionally gets hormonal break outs
this instantly sucks all the dirt
first it doesn't smell at all!
rinsing it off takes some time because it's pretty thick
when it's off my skin feels
it doesn't get rid of my acne
it doesn't dry out my skin unless i leave it on for too long
this mask really pulls out impurities which can be good
everything else because it's detoxifying
it doesn't dry as much as other masks i'm used to
this stuff cleans deep
before i had this really bad pimple on my cheek
i suppose that can be due to the fact that all the impurities are brought up to the surface of my skin
i did not feel any burning or tingling with this because i read another reviewer said they avoided it by using a thin layer of the mask
it has not burned me it just feels like a little bit of yogurt smeared on your face or something like that
i love that it doesn't dry like other face masks
i love this mask because it's not drying.
doesn't leave your face feeling tight
you are suppose to take it off with a cloth
it does what it says it will & it's gentle.
this does not leave your skin feeling tight
it's a little messy to wash off
you don't have to rub
it's not a harsh product either.
i like to use it at night as part of my routine when i have breakouts or breakouts just ubder the surface that i feel
its not the easiest to wash off- i use cheap wash cloths from amazon
i will admit this product is hard to wash off
it doesn't dry on your face like other masks do
this is where the moor mud mask is perfect because not only does it hydrate my skin
it's the first mud/pore targeting mask that i've ever used that's not drying
when you remove the mask there's still a thin film of moisturizer left
it doesnt have a harsh smell so my eyes
it also doesn't dry making your face feel tight like it's going to crack off
normally i don't do face masks because they break me out
this mask is everything.
don't be afraid because the mask is black
it doesn't leave your skin/sink/ or towels dark
plump after i couldn't believe it
don't expect miracles if you don't regularly exfoliate
for me it doesn't burn or irritate my skin.
this mask doesn't get super dry after leaving on my face for 15 mins
splashing it off won't do it.
it did make my skin look almost glossy
it didn't clear out my pores
which starts to tingle for a moment when it's applied
at that time i was quite lazy to cleanse my face with cleanser
it's a gel like consistency
it doesn't have a strong scent to it
it's gets every flaw out of your face
i don't usually get breakouts
i also love that this mask detoxes your skin without making you get those purging pimples
the entire time it's on your face it stays moist
crack like some masks do
it's not too hard to get off if your towel is wet
i don't use it as often since i don't pack on makeup on my face
would give yourself some time before you apply after you clean your skin
it doesn't feel harsh on my face
it sort of stings when i apply it on my skin
just don't leave it on too long or your face will be lobster red
fast plus long term results make this guy my new favorite detox mask
i don't get any breakouts
i tend to have big pores
don't mistake that with itching/burning
it wasn't messy at all and rinses off well.
my favorite thing about it is that it's a powdered mask
this didn't sting my face
you'll see instant change on your skin
i just turned 50, and my skin as no wrinkles!
even for my combination skin type
i don't recommend using the black soap too often during winter
meaning that it's very clean
i can easily pass for 50 because i have no wrinkles
i will definitely get this product right away if you have acne prone or orily skin
it does not remove makeup so do not mix this up with a makeup remover
it not only makes my face squeaky clean
it's like the deep cleaning allowed my other skin care products
know this soap made the difference
it doesn't smell "medicated" like many other things i've used
i guess my skin couldn't cope with the pollution
that this doesn't irritate my skin-- which has been sensitive my entire life
this has done wonders to help control that oily film i get at the end of the day
which i normally apply after cleansing anyway
it's a pretty new texture to me cause i've been using oil balms for the longest time
i like that it foams up a lot
⭐️spend the 35$ on the black soap if you're wanting your skin to look smoother
its not harsh on my skin
haven't had any clogging of pores or anything like that
i will sometimes skip the pre-cleanse oil in the am
my face feels literal squeaky clean after i use it
you may feel a little bit of dry once staring using it alone
i generally layer it under bb cream- it feels like a good level of everyday glow for me
this doesn't leave my face any dryer
this cleansing bar doesn't dry it out too much at all
does not feel suffocating to my skin either.
if you're into the no makeup makeup look this is for you
i waited to buy this product because putting anything creamy or lotion-y on my skin makes me break out just imagining it
it's my new everyday go to.
i don't use this product often
it's to remove all my make up when i'm too lazy to wipe it off
you'll still have some residue on your face
my skin doesn't like it
it all starts with a good cleanser to rid your skin of the pore clogging makeup that we love to wear
for people who think it's too drying
i know it's quite disgusting
does not strip away too much moisture
something not full of chemicals that it'll burn you or leave irritation
f you use it in the morning you may notice some peeling
with most i usually still have raccoon eyes after the shower
i can't help but touch my skin after i clean it.
this face wash does wonders
the bottle lasts awhile assuming you use only a dime size or so of product to wash your face
does not leave a filmy substance
i don't know how anti-aging it is
this stuff if magic in a bottle
this product isn't just for anti-aging!
i do not even need to use a moisturizer which is great because moisturizers tend to make my acne breakouts worse
i don't get pimples
do your skin a favor
can't comment on the anti aging factor as i don't have any wrinkles or anything like that
i gave though ones that a normal exfoliation can't go deep down enough to clear completely
i know it says it's for anti aging
i feel it helped clear my acne skin when even going to the dermatologist wouldn't help cure my acne
you don't need more the a dime size of that of gel to give you that clean
i highly recommend this cleanser for those who want acne treat with anti-aging that doesn't want to spend a fortune
am often afraid of trying new cleansers
this cleanser treats my skin really well does not irritate it
it lets my skin like a baby
only complaint is i still have my pesky blackheads
only four stars because it's to expensive
usually i need something kind of heavy duty
i am super picky when it comes to anything i'm putting on my face
this stuff gets all makeup off
def would not use it everyday because it can be very drying
i pair with clairsonic sometimes
at first i didn't like how foamy it is when it lathers
i got over it because i understood that for greasy skin "scrubbing cleansers" are a no no
you don't need to get separate makeup removers
that's usually do to my laziness
it doesn't really moisturize
does not strip the skin
my tendency to use a much gentler cleanser all contri
this stuff works well beyond just cleaning your skin
i expected this to be drying but it's oddly not.
this product unclogged pores i didn't know i had
it is rich enough to lather
i only need this kind of squeaky-clean feel in the summer to remove sunblock
the extra sweat+dirt grunge you get in hot
its honestly made a difference in the pores on my nose
especially if i do a home peel or something
i usually say you forgot to put in your eye cream today
though it does not burn your skin
this stings little when you apply it
i don't feel like it justifies $100 a bottle
it doesn't work under makeup very well
it has brightened my circles enough that i don't have to wear concealer any longer
not sure why some don't like- its super hydrating
only four stars because the beads don't break right away which can't be good for my skin
i don't care about lines, bags, wrinkles etc.
i might just have to go to a dermatologist
while it doesn't make them completely disappear it helps a lot
just a dab is all you need for both eyes
yes it fades dark circles under your eyes
it has tiny beads in it that do not easily break down when you apply directly to the skin
once it's blended apply under your eyes.
for those of you who don't know how to break the tiny beads
i think you'll appreciate this eye cream
it's not heavy like many eye products.
the only drawback is your dark circle seem lighter only when u're wearing it
i don't have really bad chronic under eye circles
i do notice a dark shadow creep up pretty often
it does sting a bit when you dab it on
the lack of sleep doesn't help
frankly i prefer arbonne's eye cream
for those of us who suffer from dark circles it's worth it since you don't really have to use as much concealer
there is no need to lather it on
no the dark circles weren't gone
don't waste your money.
you cannot use a product occasionally
it doesn't eliminate them
i even use around my lips that are kinda wrinkly with awesome results
if you're someone who loves deep cleansing cleansers
have to wear makeup everyday for work
it makes your skin baby soft super easy to use not time consuming i use it about every other day i'm in my early 20s
sometimes my complexion can look a bit dull
one star off because i don't like the packaging
doesn't feel dried out at all
it's not that complicated
it would cause me to get oil pimples.
it does go on mud-like
it's actually more on the oily side
the smell of the product is okay
if you're super sensitive to smells you might not like it
yes i believe it is for oily skin
i do think it's pricey
" here's the answer: don't look at it
it's like a mini facial every morning.
i first used this cleanser when i got a sample from glam glow after purchasing from they're website
i do find it dries out my skin a little bit
we're all guilty of it sometimes
i don't even need makeup remover
its gentle enough that i don't get irritated from the micro beads
normally when i wear makeup i break out
but it doesn't transform from mud to foam.
it's not too harsh
it makes your skin look
it also tends to make my skin a little flaky.
it's a mud mask that feels so cool
it's even toned down all my redness
i don't see any remnants of leftover make up
this cleanser didn't dry out or irritate my sensitive/combo skin
the only ding in my rating is that the pump gets air in it fairly frequently
not overpowering at all
sensitive skin gals may want to use it only once a day or less
not as foamy as you would think
any kind of harsh exfoliator is bad for my skin
does not give the burning sensation i get with the youthmud mask
if it didn't turn into that foamy consistency when wet
it works really well to get my skin squeaky clean about twice a week
a half pumps of this stuff each use
i love this product because it doesn't dry out a lot like the supermud
because this cleanses so deep you won't be oily after a few days
it may seem as if it's causing a breakout
it's really just pulling all the toxins to the surface
i couldn't stop touching my skin.
everyone's skin is different
working in to a lather i felt the little beads doing their thing
i didn't use it to remove eye makeup of course
does not sting if i don't use the blue hydrating mask
doesn't break my sensitive skin out
doesn't pull them out like some stronger exfoliants do
can use it daily, feeling good on your skin.
i sometimes get small bumps
it's nothing some decent moisturizer won't fix
i know if you have dry skin your probably have a slight fear of cleansers
between too oily it breaks you out or even worse dries you out
my face wasn't dry anymore
i do still get a occasional pimple every now
i hate cleansers that have that dull sort of soapy smell
doesn't dry my skin out like many cleansers do
have since felt like it doesn't clean my face
nothing moisturizer can't fix.
it doesn't both my acne at all
while i do love the deep cleanse it gives me i can't use it too often without it irritating
this cleanser does just that
even wearing certain types of makeup would make me look like i had something caked on my face because of those problem areas
it does not leave it feeling tight or irritated either
i came even believe how soft it makes my skin feel i can't stop touching it
however it does not come up it just gets a really milk you have lather
this cleanser is not what you'd expect from a cleanser: it doesn't foam up
are bad for your skin anyway
it doesn't leave a film on your face which is great
can't use harsh stripping products
he's got normal skin and it's not greasy for him.
you're supposed to wet your h
it'll feel like you've just emerged your face in a bucket full of cool water
like it doesn't even look like i'm wearing foundation
it's easy to work with.
the littlest thing can break it out
a lot of the reviews i've read have said it doesn't really "cleanse"
that it just feels thick on your face
it clearly says it's a mud to foam
then add water it doesn't form as much foam
for some reason it reminds me of a churro smell
i definitely can't use this cleanser daily.
it actually helps melt off waterproof eye makeup
if you want a dewy makeup look with flawless application try this product
it didn't linger or bother my sensitive skin at all
it's nice to find a cleanser that doesn't dry me out
oh and the small bottle lasts me a long time.
even when i just use this wash
it's helped out my skin a lot!
it washes off your makeup so well
not as bad as most cleansers
this doesn't make me any oilier
does not foam like advertised
i am a product junky who likes to switch it up
it always removes all of my makeup which i love in a cleanser
i don't have to use the mask as often
i guess because of "vigorosly" rubbing the product in like instructed will leave your skin red
the lather itself is what i like most because the other two do not lather as much
i don't think it does a ton for anti-aging
i rarely have to use concealer now even on the days when i don't get enough sleep
doesn't make skin look oily.
i wear it under my makeup as well
only gave it 4 stars because it's a tad pricey
the cream doesn't fix these
i don't have any eye wrinkles
i don't have a lot of wrinkles around my eyes
it doesn't burn like others
i can wear this under makeup with no problem
i don't think i like it as much as the black tea
it does not sting or irritate my eyes even if it gets too close
it absorbs nicely and isn't too heavy or greasy.
it's helped with my circles
it is perfect underneath my concealer it is not too greasy
i don't expect them to eradicate dark circles or make my fine lines completely disappear
who doesn't love that scent?
the oil isn't needed everyday
it's great for oily skin too!
the only moisturizer i don't fear putting on my skin
i don't mind the smell knowing that it's all natural
i don't feel greasy with this under my makeup
i don't notice the smell
is it's a bit thick
better moisture retention that doesn't leave me oily
i'll take that any day over a perfumey product with less results
i am not a person who wears makeup or heavy lotions simply because i feel dirty when i wear them
of course it's gonna smell
i normally avoid serums because my face tends to be oily especially in the mornings
my cheeks are so smooth i can never stop touching them
of course it's going to smell food-ish.
a lot of people complain about the scent
it's been oily lately
i like that my skins doesn't look oily afterwards
maybe you'll be pleasantly surprised too
i can't praise the nude progenius treatment milk high enough
let's not forget the fact that because it is an oil based product you won't get oily
doesn't make my combo skin oily or leave it dry
it goes away once it's on your skin
at the same time my skin is not greasy
it doesn't just smell like heaven
lol i don't mind the natural scent because it doesn't last more than a minute or so
it's like a nice drink of water.
i feel that all skin types could benefit from this product even if your oily
i sometimes use this
it doesn't change the color of it it.
like that it's a natural line
it's definitely on the pricey side
it did clog my pores just a tiny bit
it's so simple: rub it all over your face
doesn't leave a greasy residue
it does not get foamy
in the summer i find that this alone gives me enough moisture to skip using a moisturizer
nothing gets rid of my waterproof makeup
instead of stripping it like many face washes do
a definite increase form a-derma which felt a bit too soapy to be an oil cleanser to me
careful not to get it in your eyes.
it's my new go to
i can't use harsh scrubs or wipes on my face
it took forever to find a makeup remover that works on my eye makeup without excessive
will continue to reorder it melts off all your makeup even water proof
especially when your feeling lazy to remove all your makeup
i need to use another cleanser afterward to get the oily feeling off my face
this cleanser gets rid of most of my makeup in one go
sometimes i need to work at it
without irritating my skin at all
its not perfumy, and doesn't leave any residue.
i know this isn't an actual "make-up remover"
when you add a bit of water
for really deep pore cleansing you may wish to follow up with a soap-based product
the oil cleansing oil i've found that doesn't irritate my eyes
i never would have tried a cleansing oil otherwise
one pump is seriously all you need to wash your face
i used a mkeup towelette afterwards to make sure i didnt miss anything
i don't feel oily
depending on how much makeup i put on sometimes i don't even need to double cleanse
you just have to get used to not having a lather.
not one bit of residue left on my skin
doesn't leave an oily film behind
not at all like there is any oil or film or residue left behind
ered over to the skin care section to see what oil cleanser would get it all off
probably the only drawback is that it's perfumey--not a bad smell
guess perfume comes with the territory
no overbearing smell either which i've noticed is a trend in cleansing oils right now
made me feel like i needed to use a regular cleanser after to get rid of that greasy feel that remains with some oil products
doesn't run into my eyes or sting them at all.
doesn't strip your skin
that's just wasting product
didn't strip or irritate my skin
i don't wear much makeup
you don't need very much product for it to easily melt away all your makeup
this product doesn't work so well if your face is wet
although i do not recommend it for mascara
does not feel greasy
kinda rub it around
i don't have much to clean off my face
leaving very little residue for the people who say this doesn't take off their full face of makeup
i don't think you are washing your face long enough
it does not leave an oily residue or feeling on your skin
it does not irritate the eyes at all if it accidentally gets in the eyes
i don't have to reapply powder or blot anymore because oily skin isn't an issue anymore
doesn't strip the skin
(i don't wear eye makeup, though.)
they said many asians do well with cleansing oils
not greasy at all
sometimes oils don't work under makeup
or don't moisturize enough
doesn't leave a strange residue like other face oils that i've used
it also does not leave my face disgustingly oily in the morning like the other serums i've tried
seaberry is a little too oily for me
this one is better on oily skin as it doesn't feel oily at all
i can't believe i'm about to spend this amount of money on something that is used as a makeup remover/cleanser
it actually melts off your makeup while leaving your skin spotless
your skin's texture will transform just like mine did
this amazing liquids helps get rid of the crusty skin on top of them so that my makeup looks smooth
not greasy, mind you.
this product is so thick it doesn't seem to saturate the cotton pad
sometimes when i'm lazy i'll just use this before i go to bed
i don't wear face makeup
not waste it trying to take your makeup off
any of the other cleansers make my skin feel like it's burning
it's that easy on my skin.
if you question it's efficacy
i do not use it to replace my cleanser
never skip cleansing your face
i do replace it sometimes with my dr jart micro water or my bioderma to remove my makeup when necessary
using this every night to remove makeup doesn't seem practical
t doesn't make my sensitive skin break out at all
dont waste the product on places that are already moisturized
everyone's skin is different
is convenient b/c you don't have to rinse afterward
this is the only toner/makeup remover out of the hundred that i've tried that hasn't given my skin some kind of horrible reaction
if you are one of those ppl who goes to sleep with out washing off your makeup or washing your face period
i wasn't super into blue plama peel thing
boy does it remove all the remaining stuff that cleansers
i don't even wash my face with "normal" cleanser anymore unless i'm in the shower
i couldn't stomach that stuff
i prefer to remove my makeup with a wipe or coconut oil prior to using the cleanser because i love it so much
it doesn't have any scent
everyone's skin is different
feels a little thick as if u need to wash it with water
it's also a make up remover that i can use around my eyes
i love that you do not have to rinse it off at all
that you can actually see the grime that it pulls out of your skin
doesn't feel harsh at all
i'll update when it's that time of the month to let everyone know if it decreases the cysts
cleansing the skin at the same time that i don't even wash my face any more
because it doesn't interrupt the skin barrier like more heavy duty cleansing
i am unfortunately not big on daily routines of cleaning
i can feel the softness it leaves on my skin every day
not so tinted for my fair skin
i wear it everyday whether i'm wearing makeup or not
i feel like a chemist sometimes.
the only problem i have with the product is that it tends to turn my clear nail polish yellow
this also doesn't sit heavily on the skin
so this one is my favorite for the fact that it's a completely physical spf without the cast
i could see that this may not be the best product for people with pale skin
sometimes a problem with this line
i've never just gone with a tinted moisturizer instead of foundation or a bb cream
not heavy or greasy
if you choose a no makeup day your skin still looks soft
it's a very settle color
gives you a little tint of color so don't expect it to be a bb cream or in replacement of foundation
i am not a huge make-up wearer.
at first i didn't like the texture because it's on the thicker side than what i am use to
sometimes i'm told to moisturize that area more because that's why it's producing more oil
i swear it's helping with my dark spots
it didn't leave any sticky feel on my skin
doesn't take forever to sink in
this does not irritate my face or cause breakouts
one thing is to make certain to use sunscreen during the day because this can make your skin more prone to suns damaging rays
i wouldn't buy too many at a time though since the vitamin c will oxidize if it sits around too long
my skin does look dewier
serums are a little tacky right out of the bottle = normal
the product does not smell unpleasant at all
the rancid cocoa like smell is offputting enough to deter me from buying it full size
doesn't leave my skin flaky
i agree with the reviews who think it smells almost like chocolate
if your skin is still feeling tacky after applying
serums are concentrated you don't need much or your wasting it
it smells like rotten laundry
it's just fine to me.
i like that it is a bit watery so that i can smooth it everywhere i need to before it dries
people complain about the smell
not at all pleasant but i overlook that part.
the smell lingers a bit, but i can deal with it.
thought it smelled so bad that my sample must have gone rotten
if you use it as your first layer it makes your skin so smooth
it does seem a little sticky
it doesn't burn at all when applied
this should be a part of every woman's skin care routine
almost pumpkin-y smell that might bother some
it's especially chemical-y
$115 for a bottle of this miracle liquid doesn't seem so bad
glowy -- can't say it's ever looked glowy in the past
can't speak of the anti-aging effect of this product
i've always have those tiny bumps under my skin that you can't actually see
bear in mind it's just one night!!!
i want to get rid of it
it does have kind of an odd smell
the flakiness is all but gone.
i may actually shell out 100+ dollars for this stuff
it did tingle some
the smell some complain about
i rarely stick to any skin care product
i find it interesting that some people found that it made them oily
didn't irritate my sensitive skin or smell horrendous
not greasy at all --
it's light and makes my skin feel so smooth.
i can't speak to whether it reduces fine lines or "brightens" the skin
it does make me look glowy like i just had a facial
i don't mind the scent at all
the smell doesn't linger
my first reaction was that i love the light coconut scent even though it very quickly evaporates
not sticky or tacky like many serums
the scent is very much like the coconut oil i apply after my shower- a bit odd for a facial product
it disappears quickly if you hate coconut
it's a pity it's so crazy expensive!
if there is a smell that i am not smelling
i don't know if this would work with oily skin
i can't tell the difference between my scar
i typically wouldn't think it buy a high end cleanser
sometimes i'll use this afterwards
and it seems to help the bumps under my skin.
also want to try the peel pads.
when you squeeze it out of the tube there's no color change
if you're someone that likes to do sheet masks
or if you just want to pamper yourself
it's fun to use too as the mask oxygenates on your face
i love bubble masks, especially this one.
i usually just purchase the sheet masks
it's like having a little spa at your finger tips
after one application you'll notice that your skin looks
i will say that i did feel a bit "tight" after removing the bubble mask
you can feel the little popping sensation of the bubbles
you are going to flip!
it doesn't feel as strong as a peel
you won't recognize your skin
i can't wait to feel the cool
when you apply it to the skin it foams up
doesn't cause my face to feel oily or sticky
just use a dab or it can tend to ball up
if you don't overuse it under your makeup it's a wonderful way to keep acne at bay during the day as well
if you want something to make visible pores smaller this doesn't really help
i don't usually get acne
it doesn't instantly get rid of acne
this one's a real winner.
i can't say it does anything for blackheads or pores
doesn't leave dark marks from blemishes
is colorless so you can wear it during the day
so you must put your finger into the jar which is not hygienic at all for an acne treatment production
my skin does not get enough moisture from this product as a moisturizer
it doesn't altogether get me acne-free skin
i dont get zits or acne very often
i couldn't see my giant pores
shiny half through out the day or feel like you don't get enough coverage or feel like you have a mask on
it's kind of funny to look at
it just gels back over to the perfect bouncy appearance it was before you touched it i'm thinking my goodness this is flubber
definitely recommend for someone with oily/problem skin :
acne like no tomorrow
it doesn't disturb your makeup
doesn't leave a trace on your skins surface
definitely try this out if you have oily skin!!
while i don't advise using it every single day or avoid your dry spots if you do
it doesn't dry up your skin while helping to minimize your blemishes
it doesn't need up your foundation
i love that it's worked to clear up any blemishes without over-drying my skin
it isn't a miracle in a sense where the bad breakouts are gone overnight
there's not burning feeling like most products
first aid beauty will feel a little greasy
you don't need two pumps.
didn't make me look greasy like some beauty oils do
this must be aphrodite's sweat or something.
i wouldn't usually spend so much on a moisturizer
if you look at their skin they don't look like they're in their late 60's
i've always had skin that isn't acne prone
you don't look glittery by any means
so you have to be careful mixing in the palm of your h
if you want get porcelain smooth skin
this is my go-to mask for mornings when my skin is looking a little tired or dull
i don't want to do too much exfoliating
some people don't seem to like the mix it yourself aspect of this mask
side note: this mask does not make my finicky skin turn red or irritated at all
however it's a bit annoying to have to add water to the powder-- can be a mess
but i love the smell and the affect on my skin.
i love this mask for a quick fix.
it may seem pricey
didn't make my face feel too dry
i don't use it too often in a week since it's exfoliator
i've used it on it's own
really enjoy it when i mix it up with the jm cleansing oil
i think it could be gentle enough to use as part of a daily routiene
also don't scrub your skin to hard with this product
i don't find it to be messy at all.
once i rinse my face it's instantly soft
while the powder adds just enough grit to make the cleansing power of the mix even better
now i actually have to dig around my makeup drawer for the concealer when i occasionally get a pimple
i think it's also helping to keep blemishes at bay
i think i'm going to always have this there to either use daily or add a pinch to any other favorite cleanser for extra exfoliation
i would recommend this to anyone who has issues with flakey skin that gets irritated from most cleansers
i find it's not too harsh on my skin.
my only complaint is it's expensive.
my skin doesn't look or feel irritated after using it
gentle enough you can use everyday
the only thing is that it's a bit pricey
it doesn't cause any irritation
you are either scrubbing too hard or you've used too much powder
i definetely wouldn't use this alone as its very powdery
also you can choose to blend it with water which is great for those days you just want a mild exfoliation
still be flaking because for some reason my dead skin cells just don't want to come off
since it's just a powder
it's not sooo strong that you can't use it daily
i would compare this to scrubbing your face with super soft s
flaky skin especially in my t-zone
i can't seem to get it out of the bottle without dumping some in the sink
i think though my face is kinda going through a little of a purging phase with this exfoliator too
it's gritty, but it's not too harsh.
i actually found it to betoo gentle when i add water
it's a little weird to use a power to clean your face
just as a plain cleanser
am totally geeked about how much lighter this product will be in my suitcase compared to the oil cleanser
i wouldn't recommend using it on lips like the box suggests
give your skin a treat.
this really helped smooth out some stubborn flaky patches i had in just a few days
it's like scrubbing your face with a fist full of s
does not irritate my skin or cause dryness.
doesn't irritate my skin at all.
i don't use it with the oil cleanser just water
it's the perfect mix to take off my makeup while also doing a light exfoliation
i didn't care much for the cleansing oil
there's something in this that keeps me not so oily throughout the day
it's different because it's a powder
it makes a nice paste that doesn't burn skin or leave it feeling dry
i love how it's not too harsh on my skin.
i do light circles only
it's enough for my face
it sometimes isn't so easy
i'll weight it later cuz now i'm very curious if it's actually 2oz
i don't use it with an oil
this does not leave your face shiny or if you have bangs
i normally don't like to exfoliate because it irritates my skin
it didn't leave me feeling dried out
you can either use it with just water or with the cleansing oil
it's not too rough
it's so soft, so silly, and so hydrating.
i don't even think it's targeted to improve acne prone skin
it's hard to tell when you're running low
the opaque design fools your eye
dont need to go over the creases of my nose to get the junk out
who normally doesn't notice smells
i still hate that i smell like a little old lady when it's on
i don't look like i'm frowning or squinting all the time anymore
really blurs out all imperfection
did not make my combo skin oily when used during the day
my complexion so even
they don't work for my skin
know pores can't shrink
it surely fights small wrinkles by offering skin a good hydration
it's a necessity for my skin now
it's gentle on the skin yet tough on anything that's clogging the pores
my skin is so oily it's disgusting.
it doesn't get as stiff as many clay masks do
personally for me this doesn't cut it as i have an oily skin type
especially when it's my time of the month
if i use this too often it dries me out.
if you're suffering from breakouts
i don't feel like i struggle with my skin anymore combining this with a good toner use
it never irritates my skin or dries it out.
you don't have to spread it on that thick for it to work
didn't tingle my face
i can't use anything too drying otherwise i get horrible dry spots
any texture you might have on your face
don't have to scrub or anything
it's basically all of the glamgldw masks combined into one
you need this mask!
if the mask works like this
feels like it's detoxes
at the same time your face doesn't feel dry at all after you remove the mask
normally can not use clay masks
it's nice to have a detox mask that isn't drying as well
who knows if it's from this product or my hormones balancing themselves out again?
it's got a nice slip to it
there's a ton left still
doesn't irritate my skin at all
it's made me feel like my redness has toned down a lot
there's no remaining residue
this is not sticky at all
it may seem a tad tacky after application
it doesn't make my skin look greasy
it does feel slightly greasy for about 5 min if you touch your face after putting it on
it doesn't leave any sticky residue like other c serums can
doesn't ""ball or peel" up when applying makeup over it
doesn't have an odor.
there is literally not one line or wrinkle to be found
i wouldn't describe it as pleasant either
being a former derm junkie who went for my regular photo facials now i can honestly skip all that
not greasy or heavy
it doesn't irritate my eyes
don't let the light weight texture fool you
how you wouldn't like this product unless you were allergic because it's amazing
after applying it i thought it would be useless because my pores were still visible
the tube lasts a long time too you only need a small dab in problem areas
don't need something that will control shine
yet not as oily as i usually get with my make up for ever foundation
it seems as though my skin gets used to the products
i can still smell it :
some people might find this primer a bit too thick or tacky for them
you'll instantly see how it almost puts a layer down of barrier
your makeup will look so smooth
ok so no surprise that bobbi brown cosmetics are amazing
for no makeup days your skin will stay plump
it absorbs quickly and doesn't feel heavy at all.
it doesn't have that annoying paper seal in the cap that soaked up your precious cream
that doesn't make my face feel tight
i wear it under my primer
greasy if i don't apply makeup too
because obviously you don't put sunscreen on at night
it doesn't clogged my pores which i love because it means that my face has cleared out
no joke i haven't breakout since i started using this moisturizer
don't need to worry about going out in the sun
the texture of this product is interesting--you definitely need to use something other than your finger to dip into the jar
every other eye cream has burned my under eyes or just didn't moisturize it enough
it i've also noticed that my dark circles aren't as dark anymore
that there are no more eye wrinkles when i smile anymore
the texture isn't a problem it's just something different to get used to
it's a balm, so it's going to be thick!
it didn't sting my eyes
don't really struggle with under eye bags/wrinkles
because who doesn't love new skin issues popping up??
given that it's pretty eco
one of the only eye creams you can actually use on your eyelid as well
this is one of the few i can use that doesn't irritate or burn
don't overlook the eyes ladies!
it doesn't appear to have much anti-aging qualities
it does state that it's an overnight balm
doesn't bother my skin in the least which is rare
always check the ingredients to make sure your not allergic ❤️
it does nothing for my dark circles
it doesn't really fix puffiness
this cream doesn't prevent it
i don't struggle with wrinkles etc.
i do use this around my lips too.
i also really enjoy that it's more like a balm than a lotion
my eyes chap so easily
be sure to try the face cleanser too.
luckily i don't have many wrinkles around my eyes
you can actually feel the moisture in your skin
it's very light and not greasy.
i love this product because it doesn't irritate my eyes
it's thick but not greasy at all.
it's thick but not slimy.
although it says it's an overnight balm
i don't usually like to use treatments on my eyes because they are all so greasy
my eyeshadow would crack like i never seen before
my eyeshadow definitely didn't crack the entire day
did not make my acne-prone skin break out
unfortunately it's affected my skin
it's light in my skin
i love it's lack of heavy scent.
really haven't made a dent in the container either
it is not greasy or heavy
i normally use my genius cream both am
it's not oily at all.
while i don't think it's necessary to spend $40 on a cleanser
it is said cleanser can't brighten the skin because it only stays for 30 secs
don't get it in your eyes
didn't leave any greasy or filmy feeling to my skin afterwards
somehow even with my dry skin my pores had became the size of kanye west's ego
i often find i don't even need a moisturizer on top
i generally don't like the oily feeling on my skin especially my face
on the nights i'm lazy
i still don't like the smell
would suggest smelling it before purchasing if your sensitive to smells like me
it's a real luxury to be able to use this in my nighttime regimen
i swear this stuff helped soothe the burn
i didn't have any peeling
this bottle lasts forever
doesn't leave me feeling greasy at all
it lasts a week-ish usually.
it's perfect for your night time routine
don't have wrinkles yet
some texture i don't like
otherwise, it's a great product.
it's made my skin so plump
can sometimes make your eyes burn
only downside to the luna oil is the smell
this is perhaps the only formulation of retinol i've experienced that does not cause my skin to flake or break out
for some reason if i use it every night it starts irritating my skin
not a bump or lump in sight.
i don't have any trouble with lines or wrinkles or anything
my face is not as oily as it was before
the smell of this product isn't bad
not a bunch of unneeded fragrances added on
i might look like a greased chicken going to sleep
i even use it under my makeup sometimes
the darn line between my eyebrows
make sure to use spf though!
i don't really suffer from breakouts
not oily at all once it's on
your skin is left feeling like you've been at the spa
t eye cream which is so good i can't give it up
i don't mind the greasy feel
the smell takes a bit getting used to
it doesn't claim to help with acne
i think it's helpful that it goes from blue to clear as an indicator that it's completely rubbed in to the skin
somehow doesnt make my skin greasy
it doesn't irritate them
i could wax poetic about this stuff all night long if you let me
i definitely don't have redness on my checks like i use to
haven't gotten use to the smell though!
don't have a whole lot of wrinkles etc
i think it's a good product to start out with retinol since it's pretty gentle
go grab yourself a sample if you've been curious too
as long as i use a thicker moisturizer it's all good
i didn't think those were bad compared to luna which reminds me of rotten tea
the second thing i don't like is the way overdone blue coloring that isn't necessary
it's helped with some pink
i do need to put on moisturizer after i use it to make sure i don't get too dry
that's normal for me
i longed to wear a thin layer of foundation or maybe even bb cream
i needed super heavy-duty stuff all the time
i won't even go into detail about texture.
the smell doesn't bother me.
so do not plaster it on
i don't think it's done much for my pores
i get the occasional coldsore
since it's basically magic in a bottle i can ignore the smell
keep in mind this isn't my usual acne
it almost looks as if i have one of those blurring snapchat filters when i look in the mirror
i love this oil even at this price because i think it plumps
it's the perfect amount of moisture on my face
i don't know why people complain about the scent so much it's not so over bearing it's a very calming scent
if you're feeling fancy
i rarely breakout with pimples
you'll want to give this a shot
i should note that my skin isn't really acne prone
i suppose because sap serum has a pretty sticky consistency
it's a must on every nights routine.
it wasn't too thick
this makes my face even dryer.
it doesn't burn or irritate my skin.
who doesn't like fast
it's really improved the chin spot
the occasional little pimple pops up every week or so
it's the same product
i no longer get breakouts especially on my chin area
don't leave a greasy feeling on my oil prone skin
3 of the little bottles doesn't even fill the mixed bottle entirely
even if you use a little spatula to get out everything you can
i didn't have any allergic reaction to this
my skin only suffers from the occasional break out when it's "that time of the month
dull at the same time from not enough exfoliation
i don't get as oily that quickly either.
have to take lots of meds
you will see the difference in your skin
you just need to use 2-3 drops.
not oily like my usual 'morning skin'
didn't feel the usual roughness on my cheeks
sinks into my skin so easily, not oily at all.
this is the first stuff that hasn't irritated my skin
brightness i mean everything
that it's easy to get sucked into the game of trying to figure out which ones actually work
i don't even flake from it.
with the korres moisturizer i haven't had any flakiness whatsoever
you can't have any waxing done while using this product
it's a fair tradeoff for clear skin
i don't know if there would be irritation for a person whose skin is not used to retinoids
like really freaking oily skin so
aestheticians ask me what i use because my skin is so even
it can make you more apt to sunburn
i apply this stuff on my face
i don't find it to be greasy.
please give it a try if you have skin issues like mine with pores
i feel i never see results or my pores get clogged
still get an embarrassing monster when j do
albeit i do not have wrinkles
it is not a miracle for fine lines or tightening skin
you'll probably need some form of chemical peel or other medica procedure to see dramatic results
you will see a difference in your skin.
if you're starting to worry about having "aging skin"
aging is such bummer when it happens on your face
not to mention that it's laser resurfacing right near your eye
?i love that sometimes i can even use it in place of my moisturizer
i love that it's a primer, too.
not to the point where it made my makeup look atrocious or to the extreme that i felt the product was counterproductive
i find that it really hides my pores
it's smooth no rub off, or rolling.
my makeup wears the same when i apply this as when i don't
i liked this product it didn't leave my skin greasy
just bummed it's so expensive
spreading all over you face doesn't work very well
doesn't have an unpleasant smell
normally my allergies are only bad outside
doesn't leave any residue
spf just makes it go wild
most of the time i don't wear makeup to work
it does blur a bit of my imperfections
it does smell like chemicals
its not like the smells lingers
no pimples even though i wear makeup everyday now
without any primer i would get small bumps all over plus the pimples
it won't clog your pours
it doesn't irritate or cause breakouts
i don't wear makeup
who doesn't love the extra sun protection
doesn't make me paler
if it works with your skin type it's a game changer
doesn't leave me looking like a grease ball
sometimes the silicone ones are too thick for me
i find it does not layer over some lotions very well
i think a pore filling makeup primer would do a better job
it doesn't have a strong smell
it feels light rather than sticky or greasy
that it can pill if i rub rather than pat my makeup on over the top of it
does not leave greasy feel
this stuff doesn't seem to bother my skin at all
i really love the blurring effect it has underneath makeup
don´t like wear so many layers of products on your skin: with the murad invisiblur you have the primer
i don't use this as a primer
more as a filler for any lines on my forehead or a smoother anywhere else
i instantly notice a difference in my skin texture once it's applied
even though it's in packaging that blocks the light
it's hard to dispense onto my h
i don't like the packaging because it is hard to tell when you are getting low on it
doesn't leave white marks like so many sunscreens
i don't think i've been using this long enough to notice any anti-aging effects
either i itch or breakout
literally blurs my skin like it says
doesn't seem to make my hormonal adult acne worse
this is a suncreen that won't make you feel gross to put on
once on, it's not greasy.
it does have a bit of a smell
i don't like the dispenser that it's in.
it's been hard for me to find a good primer like this that can make my makeup outlast the texas heat
you just have to let the primer absorb into your skin as with any primer
that if you don't protect your skin when you're young
you can turn into a leathery wrinkle faced person when you're older
not to mention skin cancer of course
it's like a wonder product
this keeps me not-so shiny too
if you pat your foundation on
liquid or powder-- doesn't matter
not only does it help with my greasy face its an spf
plus it's the only invisible spf i've ever found.
it doesn't have a white cast in photos or when applying
my skin is fine except for a little dullness.
i do not get any pilling
i don't use it with makeup
it does make your skin look
t can possibly form clumps
i don't look greasy while getting some spf protection
although this isn't just a primer
this stuff is like glue for other products
any other primer or product with spf under my foundation usually makes me oilier
my spots haven't gotten any darker even when i am in the sun all day
doesn't get shiny or look dull
can't speak to its layering capablities / pilling issues that others mention since i didn't do this with the sample
it not only protects my skin from all those horrible sun rays
are hard to blend with my freckles for the right coverage
i cannot get foundation or concealer to work with this as it has dried by then
don't use too much because it gets super oily
i don't really recommend it if you have oily or combination skin
isn't slick or sticky like many are
doesn't make my face so greasy
it's one of the better moisturizers i'i have tried
it doesn't completely eliminate it i have noticed a mascot reduction
i like it also because it doesn't dry me out.
it is not mattifying though
it doesn't actually moisturize that well
it doesn't shrink your pores at all
not moisturize too much to bea greasy mess
it's a nice lotion like gel that cools your face when you apply it
dries quickly and is not sticky or tacky.
sometimes i have even forgot to use a setting spray afterwards
my makeup doesn't look shiny
i do think it does a decent job of keeping my oily skin at bay
normally i can find things that keep me shine free for a litttttle while
i don't find myself getting shiny throughout the day
it's oily all day long
you still have to use it in moderate amounts or it can get cakey
i don't think it does much to reduce the size of pores or control oil
can get quite oily in summer
for me, this gel did not make my skin matte.
it doesn't make my sensitive cheeks freak out.
the humidity always makes my face turn into a greaseball
even though my nose is always oily
so going without lotion
it doesn't feel like your skin is just caked with products
it isn't meant to keep you oil free
it doesn't add any oil either
probably need to look for a makeup product like a mattifying primer
unlike other gel moisturizers it doesn't leave skin feeling tacky
once it dries to a soft matte finish you cannot even feel that it is there
perhaps because it's very gel-like
though my normal/combo skin doesn't typically get oily
i do *usually* experience a shiny t-zone after wearing makeup for a few hours
it doesn't spread easily when i put it on
so far it's the only day time moisturizer that doesn't leave me oily again within a few hours
it doesn't irritate my skin at all
definitely worth a try if you have similar oily/combo skin
i don't look disgustingly oily
i still get super oily/shiny within hours or even minutes on some days
my makeup lasts all day
doesn't leave me oily/cause breakouts
i usually wear it alone no makeup weekends.
i love that it's not greasy
it's light enough for day wear and night.
or your skin is irritated enough to produce more oil?
if you need to mattify i suggest a powder
doesn't make me break out or more oily
don't usually have a lot of time for touch-ups
the last thing i want to do is slather my face with a heavy moisturizer
it's not drying at all.
i didn't find it "mattifying," though.
when i applied this moisturizer on it's own
i do use the becca ever-matte primer underneath
it doesn't keep me matte all day
i would still recommend you use a good powder over if you're especially oily
make sure not to use too much or it will make your skin feel oily
a lot of reviews talk about making it give oily skin-
that gets oily easily with anything that is put on it
doesn't "weigh" my skin down or irritate it.
t's almost too mattifying for me
which i never thought would be possible with my oily/combo skin
doesn't leave the rest of my face greasy
not shiny at the same time
thats how good it is at controlling oil since im usually oily even in winter
my skin always gets oily at this time of year.
it's been tricky finding a moisturizer that is free of alcohol
this moisturizer does not break me out
not too rich that it clogs my pores
not too thin that it doesn't moisturize or strip the skin
this product has not made me oily at all!
at the end of they day i'm not at all oily.
i 100% recommend for anyone with oilier skin in the summer
this doesn't keep me matte all day
if you're not as oily as me
you're probably not because i'm a grease ball
it can be drying if you use nothing with it
let this dry before applying any primer or makeup because it will ball up if you put too much on the skin layer over layer
i needed something thin enough to use in the mornings under my makeup
this product has been the only thing that has helped my oily skin
my t-zone is the area that gets the most oily
i don't need to use a primer after this
my skin doesn't break out as much
if i get overzealous
simply fill in your pores to make your skin appear smoother
i like this because its not tinted
i lightly pat on a small amount over the areas that bother me
you can not wear it under makeup as primer
then it's like it's melting off my face
t doesn't correct skin tone
it does leave my tzone matte throughout the day
i don't think it's oil, it's just glimmery.
fillers don't work and primers only go so far.
the makeup doesn't cake up in them like it used to
her nose does not get greasy during the day
deep poorsi love that it doesn't congest my skin
my bags under my eyes can get so bad
i don't have much puffiness
my eyes don't feel heavy when i leave work
try finding products that won't react funny on my face
i love the feeling of removing my makeup
it doesn't make my pores suffer either!
not sure if this is curing my acne or if my old moisturizer was just breaking me out
it doesn't sting or turn my face red like a lot of other moisturizers do
not greasy at all
how little you need to cover your face
just to be clear not all alcohols are bad for your skin
wouldn't cause my skin to react
doesn't leave my skin oily and lasts all day
love that the cream is thick yet when i put it on
i don't mind that for a night cream
this product did not cause any redness or burning
it wears well underneath full makeup too.
this moisturizer doesn't react with other products
it doesn't leave my face feeling greasy
didn't have to be too picky about my cleansing
doesn't sit well on my oily t-zone
other strong moisturizers weren't doing the trick
it doesn't leave a residue
in just one use the flakiness was gone!!
with this cream on top my flakiness from the medicine is gone as well
i need to get more asap because it's still nasty cold here in the midwest
it has been the only moisturizer to really fix my flaky skin
i don't mind it cuz it's fast absorbing
my face is still glowy
time for something that's useless
it's thick just like i love it
it doesn't make my skin feel heavy or oily like other moisturizers
makes your makeup go on smooth
i personally only use at night because i have oily skin
i typically never use face cream
it's not flaking anymore
this product really is a moisture bomb on your face :
it doesn't leave a tacky greasy feeling like so many other moisturizers yet it does the job
i instantly fell in love with this because it hydrates my skin without making it feel greasy or to heavy
it's not very thick
it's not too thick or sticky at all.
it hasn't clogged my pores at all like most moisturizers tend to
even acne on my face
not giving me breakouts
this did not affect my skin other than giving it a plump soft look
it definitely doesn't feel heavy or greasy
some creams are heavy or greasy, not this one.
not greasy or heavy.
the stickiness of this is what bothered me
i feel like it didn't soak up into my skin like my lush facial moisturizer does
yet somehow i still get dry skin on my face
why people don't patch test
i would not recommend this product for oily or normal skin
no residue, nothing but clean!
the occasional pimple or two here
don't get my skin really clean
this face wash does not irritate it at all
it foams up enough to wash my whole face
it gives you that squeaky clean feeling
it's never felt at all drying
you really only need a pea-sized amount to get a good lather
they either were so gentle that they did nothing to remove dirt
be careful around your eyes it burns like crazy!
if you don't mind about the tightness afterwards you will love this
a dime size portion can really work up a lot of lather
doesn't strip my natural oils off my face
maybe it is actually designed for oily skin
not bad or an off putting smell
not to mention my skin doesn't feel so tight after i cleanse like my normal cleansers
it doesn't because there is still makeup on the cotton pad when i follow with toner
it won't remove your makeup
i don't sleep in my makeup
i wouldn't say it exfoliates though.
it really feels like i'm sucking out every impurity from my face
it just foams up in your h
it really helps to lather up the product even though i can get a nice foamy lather with just my h
when my t-zone will be more oily
i still get flaky sometimes
i can even skip using makeup remover
just feel squeaky clean
i didn't have to use a lot of product for it to lather
it doesn't take that much to clean my face
or maybe i'm just being picky.
i dont mind the smell it's subtle
doesn't feel too heavy / greasy
my t-zone doesn't get out-of-control-oily
doesn't break me out or irritate my skin.
it has this subtle scent that i can't quite put a name to
the smell doesn't irritate my skin or eyes
it's a nice medium to light moisturizer that sinks in quick
doesn't leave me greasy
way too many are thick or leave my skin feeling blah
it does it's job as a moisturizer
good to wear it alone or underneath makeup
this moisturizer is so light weight that you can't even feel it on your face
it's actually so dry it hurts
the skin sucks up the moisturizer so there aren't greasy feeling after few minutes
it never leaves a greasy feeling
it's filled with nothing
i don't like greasy feel
i can't seem to use their other products because they have silicon in them
is often flakey if i don't have a good moisturizer
doesn't feel heavy on the skin
they're not so thick that they make me look like a grease ball
i wouldn't recommend this for someone with oily skin
it will make them too greasy.
provides enough hydration for my skin to not flake or look dull
it doesn't have any spf
it's baby smooth again
i love that it doesn't leave me feeling oily
my problem with moisturizers is that they either don't hydrate enough
or they make my skin feel greasy
my face doesn't look of feel like a grease mess or move around under my makeup if i happen to put any on that day
i would also like to mention that i used to have oily skin
anyways i would use this after i cleanse my face
t doesn't get sticky like other products
not to mention it makes your skin feel super dewey
probably wouldn't recommend it if you have oily skin though
it doesn't absorb so fast that you feel cheated
like it's not even on your skin
probably for those with oilier skin
not greasy at all
finding a product that won't irritate my skin isn't easy
doesn't leave an oily film on my skin
in addition it doesn't feel sticky or overwhelming which is why it's a must have for me this summer
even though it says the product is for oily combination skin on the product description
i didn't give it 5 stars just because it doesn't improve my uneven textured skin or my dark spots
that truly moisturizers your face without feeling heavy on your skin
my skin eats this stuff up
when there's so many options for moisturizers out there
not enough for my normal borderline oily skin in winter
it doesn't feel like i'm putting lotion/moisturizer on my face
it's not so rich that it clogs my pores
it's non sticky feels great.
it's perfect for the summer because it's cooling
does not leave a tacky feeling
is not greasy at all
doesn't clog my pores either.
so while this is too lightweight for me to use on it's own
it isn't sticky once it settles into the skin.
does not feel thick/sticky on my face afterwards
doesn't keep my oils at bay
i swear it also helps cool my skin if it's irritated too
after awhile my face isn't oily like other moisturizers
i think it's too heavy
i can't recommend this enough if you live in a humid climate
doesn't sit on the surface of my skin
not greasy or irritating
it's not going to change your skin overnight
doesn't feel oily like with other creams
usually if the product doesn't have a gel base it makes me break out
doesn't leave the skin shiny
it doesn't make me break out at all while actually giving me moisture
that's all i need to keep my skin in check
usually i don't stray from my facecare routine because i have sensitive skin
i usually count on clinique
aquabomb is where it's at!
plus it's a pretty color
found it left me feeling slick because it didn't absorb well enough
so this stuff doesn't quite do the job in the middle of winter– i usually add another moisturizer to my routine
it's almost gel like
does not leave your skin feeling greasy.
i wasn't fond of the slightly sticky consistency it leaves on the skin at first
i don't feel like i have a thick film over my face
doesn't leave a greasy feeling
definetly recommend if you normally get dry skin at night
it just didn't hold up well without this primer moisturizer
especially now that it's summer
i can't use any cream
that i usually use
probably the great thing is it doesn't clog pores
this product does wonders on my combination skin.
throughout the day my skin doesn't get oilier
this is not like any other moisturizer.
it's so cool to the touch
i feel it's hydrogenating.
it's between a gel and a cream, i guess.
it has a light texture that doesn't make me breakout
the only thing i want to point out about this product is that it is so hydrating that my skin stays a little shiny
this moisturizer doesn't do that
it doesn't make me oily at all
it doesn't make me breakout either it's like a gel
this may not be to every bodies fancy tho
i find that you can even layer on the moisturizer
it doesn't feel heavy or make you more oily
i don't wear makeup to work to control my t-zone from getting oily
not irritating or a deal breaker
it's a bit too heavy for daytime use for my skin anyway
i can definitely tell when i've gotten lazy with my bedtime routine
it doesn't leave my skin greasy or sticky.
not at all greasy
i don't like having to use a spatula to get the product out
otherwise, i don't see any firming.
only bad thing is that it doesn't work too well under concealer
it doesn't burn or sting.
so many eye creams sting/burn if you apply them to your lids
i've finally found one that doesn't burn
everyone keeps saying it's too thick
honestly all you need to do is just dab a small amount around you're eyes
let's talk eye cream.
i love this, it's hydrating but not greasy.
that kind of made me to buy this brightening mask
claiming this cream was so rich it left some with milia
let's hope that i don't see new milia!
it sinks into skin almost immediately so you don't have to worry about your hair sticking to it or if feels weird on your skin
doesn't make my face feel gloppy
worry about breaking out when i apply any type of cream
for when my sensitive skin freaks out
i can't say much for its "brightening" properties
this mask does it all
it doesn't really "peel-off
you can just rub your face
i think we all loved those plastic-y peel-off masks from long ago
maybe the point of using quality products is they may not behave like the chemical-laden grossness we used years ago?
little bits do get stuck in your hairline if you're not careful
so many masks burn my skin
maybe it's something to use before a shower or at bedtime
i don't find it repulsive or anything
yes the peel off part is annoying
i love peeling the mask off although it doesn't really show
it's true that it will get stuck in your hair if you get too close during application
didn't do much to minimize my pores
i chose this mask because i had these annoying bumps
does not peel off like a traditional peel off mask
there that i couldn't grasp with my fingers
be careful not to get any in your hair as it is a bear to get it off
don't forget to moisturize afterward
easy to use and smells ok.
doesn't have any added fragrance which is a big plus
it especially sticks in your hair.
i only have the occasional pimples now.
i find that it is slightly tacky to the touch after it dries onto the skin
it says you can use it as like a spot treatment or a mask
this didn't clog my pores or give me any breakouts
it's definitely correcting my dark spots
it's a little greasy on the skin
don't have to scrimp when applying
you only need 1 pump to cover your whole face.
this stuff is non irritating
the moisture bomb has a bit of a waxy-ness to it that i don't like because it sits on top of my skin where the other two absorb completely
does not clog pores
you don't feel greasy afterwards because it absorbs so fast
does not clog the pores
it's for the people that know that skin care requires curated layers
in my opinion it's the same as their true cream aqua bomb
do not overlook the belif aqua gel oil
it did seem to clean well
not a scent i like
ridiculously so that it's been a nightmare trying to rub
it gets rid of my mascara like a dream
i typically have horrible dark circles under my eyes no matter how much sleep i get
doesn't do so much in the lightening which i don't mind because it plumps your skins so well
i absolutely love that i don't have to stick my fingers into a pot
the pump releases the tiniest amount so you aren't wasting product
it's like a mask for your eyes
it's made my tiny little eye wrinkles more smooth
not greasy i use this instead of the serumexcellent results
at 49, this eye cream does the trick.
i rarely rave about eye creams.
i don't have dark circles
it's definitely my new staple item.
does not irritate or cause burning to my eyes
then the sun doesn't help
my lips are looking so cute
it's now a part of my beauty routine.
try it, you'll like it....in a big way!
i don't think it would be super great for anyone with oily skin or really dry skin
so i wouldn't worry about the tint.
it actually absorbs into my skin which i love.
perfect for under foundation because it's not heavy
it does not make your face glittery
does not leave my face oily
i literally feel like im paying more for just glitter in this product compared to clinique gel moisturizer
i mix it with my bb for a little extra moisture.
this is light enough to wear alone or before makeup to add brightness to the skin
my skin doesn't feel tacky or greasy at all after applying this
that is usually an issue that i have with other moisturizers since i have oily skin
i literally do not have to retouch my makeup all day long
i am usually oily a few hours after i put on my makeup this stuff is amazing
don't be fooled by the glittery cream you can barely notice it
especially if you apply makeup overtop
tend to stay away from anything labeled "all skin types"
just makes my pores disappear
you can feel the moisture work easily into your skin
the skin was so dry that my regular acne go-tos weren't helping
i don't have to wipe it off
it's so nice that the "counter-intuitive" of oil products on skin is going away
it's not fancy with all the great smells some other br
my only complaint is that it's a little messy when you get it out of the dropper
even out skin tone
this is literally food for your skin.
i will say that this is oily
it can make such a difference in my skin if it's looking a little dull
it's not too heavy and not greasy at all.
i don't know how it would work for oily skin though
it'll change your life.
see how it wears under makeup
it did not hurt my sunburn and i did not peel.
it's not overly oily like some products.
i can't wait to try it under moisturizer
it just seems to be another facial oil though
i didn't know what to do with it as i have other facial serums
on the occasional zit i may have
i think you shouldn't be worried much because bht can be used in cosmetic with a small amount
hey my feet are super dry
can tend to get crepey looking in areas
i do ad just a touch to my eye cream for day wear
you only need like 2 drops
i don't even need to use my clarisonic everyday to get that super clean feeling
i don't use it everyday
can be a little drying so make sure to use moisturizer right after
my skin is not as dull
this doesn't dry me out or make me too oily
i dont get as many pimples as i used to before my period
this gets rid of my makeup so well!
smells kind of like apples too
everyone needs this i use it to remove all my makeup even my eyeliner
the pump on the mud size it's kinda ehhhh other then that it's perfect
do note i use sephora make remover wipes before i use this
it doesn't do enough to fully clean my pores
wonderful cleanser that doesn't strip your skin completely dry
we'll see how it works this winter when my skin is sensitive
i don't really suggest using this to take off eye makeup
it's very gentle and doesn't dry my skin.
it's gotten better results than any topical washes
it isn't harsh on my face at all
because i was too lazy to look for a new br
usually have some annoying black heads on my nose
the pump on the "clay" side of the bottle gets a little finicky
the only downside is that the pump doesn't let the product go straight into your h
$39 is a bit pricey for a face wash
it doesn't foam a lot
i've noticed that my combo skin has started to even out where my oily areas are less so
you should have a certain makeup remover
thats because its bringing everything out to the surface of the skin
it's definitely going to be a regular facial cleanser from now on
even the glam glow super mud clarifying one isn't as effective on me like everyone else i see
lets be honest packaging doesn't make a product
one for the oil so you can add more of the oil if it's too drying
the only one i'm ehh about is the blue one
i don't even need to apply any foundation -- some highlighter
it's definitely not overpowering
doesn't feel like it's weighing down my face
wouldn't usually spend my money on
it is the first facial oil i have ever purchased because i was always afraid that oils would make my skin "extra oily" since i'm already on the oily side
i usually wear it at night
i don't think the scent lasts at all
it just melts into it
especially since it's summer time
even though i have combo skin
i don't mind the smell
at least i don't feel it as a strong scent
i feel like i'm less oily now.
it doesn't leave my skin greasy it just smoothed out my texture
just mix it with your fingers
the smells makes me keep applying more
thankfully it doesn't linger after application
i think some of my blemishes
it's not irritating at all
i still don't feel like it's too heavy
i usually get bad headaches from overly flowery scents
doesn't feel like the josie maran argan oil.
it's almost like a oil to cream formula
it is not a greasy product
i could probably do with a bit of concealer
i love that it's a got a matte finish as so many moisturizers with spf leave my face shiny
it wouldn't be enough hydration in the winter
i don't need much moisture
i can't speak to any anti-aging benefits
i don't like wearing makeup on my skin during the day
sometimes i mix a few drops of a foundation serum with this for some extra coverage that still looks like you are wearing nothing at all
seems to control oil because my face is not as shiny as usal
it's a little bit hard to melt into the skin especially when ur skin is dry
and it doesn't feel heavy.
i normally use algenist genius
it's also supposed to be unscented which i suppose is true
there's a bit of a noxzema-ish smell to this product
i don't find it overpowering at all
i wouldn't recommend it for someone with dry skin cus it doesn't offer too much moisture
it does well under my makeup
leaves little need for powder.
it's not oily at all
i think it would be good for oily or combination skin
it's close to impossible to find a daily face cream that has a good spf
the only reason i don't give it 5 stars is because it's a bit heavy on the sunscreen feeling
it's a little pricey but the jar is huge!
i get oily pretty easy through out the day
this cream does the job
not irritated my acneprone skin at all
this cream does such a great job blurring imperfections that people think i've used a filter even when i post an unfiltered picture
it provides spf without feeling greasy and nasty.
it doesn't smell funky like some of their products do
it almost feels like a primer
it doesn't feel oily
it really does blur your complexion.
still have oily skin this stuff keep me oil free all day long
it doesn't feel greasy at all
i recommend trying this out if you have combination or oily skin
it's all i've been using
with oily skin i love that it doesn't leave me too shiny
i am not sure if it is hormonal or what i am eating
i apply a little more in super oily areas n really helps
it doesn't feel like i'm wearing a cream to the touch
doesn't smell like a sunscreen or feel heavy on my skin
it doesn't break out my skin either
not one bit heavy or greasy
this product doesn't irritate her skin
it does not make her skin oily at the end of the day
what's not so great about it: a bit pasty
if you're tough stuff, you'll like it.
it doesn't cause any allergic reactions nor makes my skin break out in specific areas
it is not overbearing
if you just apply this straight to your face you will have a white layer
if you apply it to your fingers
i put makeup over it usually
great for layering under makeup that does not have spf though
always put a little jojoba oil or a regular moisturizer under it-wait for that to sink in
it's not oily and doesn't break me out.
it doesn't have a strong scent either which i like
goes on smooth stays on haven't burned yet i love this sunscreen
of course it's a bit white right when you put it on
does not clog pores
this is the perfect sunscreen if you want to wear just one thing on your face
fixed my horribly flakey skin after one application
i like that i can skip a moisturizer when using it
humid it's one less thing on my face that might slide off
too much will leave a white cast on your face
i don't wear face makeup
so can't report on how a face makeup works over top of this
in combo with the ultra repair cream it's fine
didn't clog up my pores
doesn't leave me oily at all if i use this alone
i didn't get sunburned on my face once.
which the 5 in 1 face cream doesn't have
honestly i don't get sunburn
the other reviewers are correct in that if you warm it first there is no white hue
if you're using it alone it does give your skin a white-ish tint
it does not leave your skin with an oily finish
it's definitely better than the josie maran sunscreen this one is not as sticky
you won't get a white cast
you'll probably end up using too much or leave white streaks
rubbing will only make it feel tacky.
can leave some white streaks on the face if i try to rush
if you keep massaging it in
i don't get greasy by the end of the day
there's not even much of a scent.
doesn't have that typical heavy sunscreen feel.
it says it won't cause breakouts
the cream is white, but does not leave a cast.
once it's rubbed in you are good to go
had a non-greasy feel
doesn't feel thick at all
this is the first moisturizer/screen screen combo i've found that doesn't break me out
try to wear something with spf every day
this moisturizer is not too thick it's not greasy
your skin doesn't look shinny right after application
there's no pilling if you over-apply
it does not have an odor
it's not sticky or greasy or heavy at all
i didn't notice a weird smell at all.
it doesn't smell weird to be
so many masks that i try make my skin raw
i love that it doesn't irritate my skin
the scent is not that bad
it dries really quick
i find it hard to find a mask that has a mattifying effect
it's worked really well for my oily / acne prone skin
it's gentle enough to use a couple times a week if you want
i love that you can see all your pores when it's drying on your face
it's quick and easy to use.
i can't say if it's from the mask itself or from using a wet washcloth to remove it
i like the scent too.
the smell is bad
i could see exactly where it was sucking the oil out of my pores
a couple of pesky whiteheads are gone now
i look for anything that can shrink or clean out my pores
nothing bad it smells like a mud mask to me
i do recommend making sure you wash your face the next day or before putting on makeup because it can make your makeup flake
i don't think this mask smells that bad.
although it burns sensitive skin for the first few minutes it legitimately gets rid of almost all of your blackheads
this mask is everything.
it is so much it's almost disgusting
it helped suck the junk
this stuff cleans my skin
f you are sensitive to smells this may not be one for you
makeup n make my face so smooth
know your skin type
you don't smell it when it's on
it doesn't sting or burn
it has a smell but it's not bothersome.
you are feeling like your skin is a bit shiny
the product doesn't smell too strong
i don't wear makeup everyday
i love how my makeup looks after using this mask.
i didn't expect this mask to completely rid my pores of dirt
i don't need makeup!!!
you don't need to use it as often as some products
the zits that i've had didn't go away
no matter how much concealer
there is a texture in the mask which i kind of enjoy
this mask is the only alternative i've found to glamglow's supermud that actually gets everything out of my pores
it does have a bit of scent in it
it's now a staple product 4 me!!!
when you apply it you can see the mask cling to all the imperfections on your face
other than that it's perfect
the first thing i've used that's actually healed my acne scars
super clean whenever i use this
it doesn't tingle or feel like it's working on my skin
make sure you exfoliate really well before you use this mask or it won't be able to properly pull all of your gunk to the surface
i knew i would not go back to my glam glow mud masks
don't dissolve so they're just sitting on your face
the smell isn't as bad as some are making it out to be
does tingle when you apply it
i won't do that again because it made it extra oily
not acne prone if that helps any
i don't find it bothersome
i only did 4 stars because it kinda burns when it's working
not only does it suck out all the extra oil from my pores
it's what's on the inside that counts
this mask does it all
your annoying co-workers
buy yourself this mask
it does great pulling the "junk" out of my pores
you can see the mask working as it dries
desperate for something that will help clear your pores
the bubbles make it feel like someone is tickling your skin
the product doesn't bubble as much as i'd like
t oxygen facial you will love this one even more because it's 1/3 of the price with very similar results
you can really feel the product bubble up on your skin
it does not leave your skin tight.
otherwise it's kind of sticky
the bubbling as the cleanser sits on your face feels so great i don't even care if it's actually doing anything
i like how thick it becomes as it foams so you can massage your face
you can't beat the price on this mask
it's just as good at the others that claim to "infuse your skin with oxygen" or what have you
figured i wouldn't splurge on something too fancy
doesn't strip your skin or leave it begging for moisture
did not burn or tingle, as i have sensitive skin.
this doesn't irritate it at all
kinda tickles when the bubbles start to form.
try not to walk around too much when it's bubbling up
this one did not add radiance to the skin like the ptr
it really does deep clean
i even apply a little to my lips
i don't wash it off.
it doesn't add to it
i guess because i washed my face so thoroughly it burnt
my skin usually looks a bit flakey in some areas even if i'm well moisturized
it's not messy or sticky
i normally don't care much one way or another for cleansers
i usually plop some on my clarisonic
maybe that's where the warming effect comes from
it didn't unclug my pores
while it doesn't necessarily have the foamy leathery suds you may be used to
the only down side i think is that it doesn't lather up very much
there's no tight feeling!
this does not make your face oily.
i find it's warmer the dirtier my skin is
i wouldn't suggest putting this on your eyes to remove eye makeup because it's really tacky
no oil or makeup.
this is one of the only products that isn't oil-based or targeted for waterproof makeup removal that will remove my perversion mascara without leaving streaks all down my face
there's no need for a double-cleanse
the only thing you should know about this cleanser is that is does not foam very well if you use it with a sonic cleansing system like a clairsonic
it's heavy duty make up you might have to wash your face twice to make sure everything is off thoroughly
moisturizer maybe 3 times a day if i need it
cleared up most of my clogged pores in just a few washes it's gentle i love it :
it would get 5 stars if not for that tiny bit of mascara that requires me to pull out my makeup remover
removes make up like nothing else
i just might use it as a body wash
it does take off regular mascara
i got this for my boyfriend who tends to have oily skin in the summer
i always have troubles removing all of my mascara even though it isn't waterproof
i usually use sephoras all in one gel remover bc it was simple
normal skin everywhere else on my face so findng a cleanser that works well all over without stripping my skin is difficult
the formula is so billowy i have never felt a cleanser like this
that maybe because jurlique doesn't use harsh chemicals
i don't know how it well it removes makeup i don't wear it too often
holy guacamole this stuff makes your skin so soft is you use over another moisturizer
it doesn't feel overly oily at all.
it doesn't feel heavy on your skin.
it blends in so well into the skin it doesn't feel too greasy
it's like my skin absorbs it almost instantly
it helps so much to get rid of my dry patches without my t zone being too oily or breaking me out
it's especially perfect after i use origins acne spot treatment
it doesn't feel heavy
it's great on my acne prone skin.
it doesn't clog your pores
did not get oily at all
don't apply around your eyes
my skin has not been nearly as oily as it usually is
serums that give hardly any results
3-5 drops pressed into your skin is just enough when used with moisturizer
it's a hot mess in the little packet if you don't realize how shear
it doesn't feel oily at all
rather than trying to strip my skin of the oil
i definitely need to use another oil or moisturizer with it
it doesn't leave a greasy residue
i find with moisturizers they break me out superficially
this stuff soaks right into my pores
this is a good skin oil if you have acne-prone skin
it's really reduced any dullness in my skin
somehow this seems to balance it
doesn't leave me feeling greasy while i sleep
this one doesn't clog my pores at all
i can't imagine not having this as part of my nightly skin routine
i read multiple reviews of this where people complained about how easy it is to accidentally spill the product since the bottle is made out of such a light plastic
has really helped wiith flakiness that i get on my jawline for some reason
it's a great dry oil that doesn't make an "oily" skin
i sometimes will have acnes around my tzone
i don't have zits on tzone anymore
i didn't buy the matching cream because it was suggested for combination/oily skin
i can't believe this oil has saved my oily skin!!
which my skin usually doesn't tolerate
it made my dull
if your skin is combination
i can't say how much it creates a "radiance" for your skin -- i only tried it once
all in all, a clumsy bottle with nice oil inside.
this oil is very refreshing to use on your face after you take your makeup off
doesn't leave my skin oily or greasy feeling
it is not super greasy or drying just perfect.
it doesn't make me oily throughout the day
it's not heavy like a normal beauty oil
doesn't leave a heavy film
this product doesn't leave your skin greasy it soaks in quickly
it's not greasy feeling like other oils
it comes out like a cream
it goes on like a cream
then foams up on your face so be careful applying around your eyes because the foam can get drippy
looks like a lotion when you pump it out
it bubbles lightly like i have not experienced before
let the bubbles do their job
i usually use after i shower
i usually leave the mask for 20 -30min on my skin
i didn't use any moisturizer after though.
it had such a nice tickle to my face immediately upon application
it doesn't seem to want to dispense any more
there's no way i've gone through 1
it sure is tempting to
it's one of those "break glass in case of skin emergency" kind of products
this doesn't affect my skin in a bad way at all
this mask is everything!
when a skin care can make my gross skin look good im all in
had super annoying patches of dead skin that looked awful under makeup
or just buy the mask
the next morning, still no yucky wrinkles.
it's so easy to spread across the skin
my skin is more plump and less flakey from this.
i don't think this has clogged my pores.
there's no greasy feeling and it smells amazing!
this stuff doesn't irritate it
smells like baby wipes, but definitely worth it.
this cream doesn't make me feel greasy or breakout
if it's sitting on top of your skin
the pot thing is really annoying- i prefer pumps to keep the ingredients fresh
it's just a nice, basic moisturizer.
it doesn't leave my face too shiny
i usually deal with some t-zone redness
then there are times when i eat something that is a rosacea trigger
for people who say it's suffocating
i cannot tell you how many over the counter anti-aging/ moisturizers i have tried
it doesn't feel greasy and has a light scent.
this moisturizer didn't both me at all!
for me personally i don't buy the spf version because this cream is so thick
so to find a moisturizer that doesn't break me out is amazing
who would like a moisturizer that doesn't irritate or clog pores
it's rare to find a make up br
i cannot seem to find another product that moisturizes my skin like the extra repair does
other moisturizers just weren't doing the trick
you don't need a lot as it is thick
my t zone didn't look as oily as other creams
if you're at your wits end with sub par moisturizers it's worth a try
it doesn't disturb makeup application or wear.
if you dont like scents on your face
it's now part of my regular routine.
it becomes more absorbed into my skin i think huh?
to me that is dull
if it's not enough moisture
if you don't have acne prone skin
it does not leave my face slick or greasy at all.
i hate products that make me feel oily this doesn't it feels like silk on my h
who doesn't like the smell of a baby :
it does not leave a sticky residue on my face
it's a great basic moisturizer if you've got combo-oily skin
myface breaks out so bad
it doesn't smell strong or feel greasy.
as a face cream, i feel it's not for me.
it's not at all greasy
i can't use this during the day since it's not compatible with pores no more
i love this cream because it is just a cream.
it doesn't feel heavy on my face at all.
didn't use it since i thought it would be too heavy for my combo/oily almost 60 skin that still breaks out when irritated
it doesn't feel heavy nor greasy
it feels really comfy on the oily t-zone
you only need the tiniest bit to cover your face.
it's enough for your whole face
if you've used any other shea
you should know that it contains fragrance
skin feels clean and does not irritate.
this product did not make my skin tingle or burn
doesn't quite get every pore
this mask did not irritate my skin at all!
didn't irritate my skin in the least
doesn't dry our your skin as much
it doesn't feel tight or chalky like some clay masks
you only need a thin layer so it lasts forever!
yet not strip my normal-skin-type cheeks
you'll see that the mask actually draws all of it out
i leave it on for about 15-20 minutes because that's how long it takes to completely dry on my skin
definitely just put a thin layer on like the directions say
can't say if it keeps the skin detoxed
usually don't stray from what i know works
didn't seem to irritate my skin
i wasn't expecting it to be as powerful as it it because it's not a mask you peel
it's not harsh on my skin
this lightweight mask does everything i want to do in just about 10 or 15 minutes
this mask looks pink on me when i apply
it's not even advertised as a pore minimizer!
i like how it doesn't have a lot of chemical ingredients
you can actually see the pores that it has soaked into
don't let the price of it sway you because it's magic
this doesn't make me break out or burn my skin
i can usually deal with blackheads
you can see oils spots where your pores are
i love that you can literally see the oil being absorbed
the best thing this mask does it tighten your pores
it's the only thing that has gotten rid of stubborn white heads
i think it helps my pores that tend to clog up with oil
clay masks can be a bit underwhelming.
it doesn't appear to set out my skin
wouldn't be too moist or else it would clog the pores in my t-zone
please note it's 2 different masks i owe both of them as well the glam i use once every 2-3 weeks only
i love that it doesn't have chemicals
mask did wonders for my skin
this mask doesn't irritate or burn my skin at all
doesn't leave my skin feeling like a desert like 90% of other masks
my skin was extra oily this summer which made my pores a real hassle to the point where i could literally feel them on my face
my favourite thing about this mask is the little holes it makes when it drys on your skin
i will again because they're so expensive
i also don't want my skin to stop reacting to this mask
you can literally see it sinking into your pores
it makes my skin less congested without drying me out or causing my sensitive skin to go berzerk like it does with other detox masks
i could actually see my pores
you can see your pores
you can literally see it pull the dirt out of your pores
you can literally see the dirt it pulls out of your skin
if you'll wake up with a pimple
once it drys i can actually see little dark spots where it has sucked the oil out of my pores
it's not over drying which is nice.
and i love how easy it is to wash off.
it's like you can't move your face
almost like lavender scent to it which didn't bother me
with my shrinking results i feel it absolutely did help clear my pores of impurities
it's gentle enough my skin doesn't turn red
i love how it dries so you know when to wash it off
in the form of huge under-the-skin pimples in places i normally don't have them
i find that after using my mask my skin even seems less red
it's a little difficult to tell when you're supposed to wash it off
it's a mask i won't do without
i will say if you have a fairer skintone you may experience some redness afterwards
it can be hard to find masks that actually improve my skin without irritating it
you can see all the impurities that this mask pulls out of your skin
it's been looking dull
i gave all of my products that weren't up to par with the ones my derm provided away to my younger sister who doesn't have my postpartum skin issues
i love how this mask is smooth
it also works great if you have pimple or pimples
she doesn't use a lot of facial products nor does she wear a ton of makeup
soothing so that it's almost like i'm giving myself a little at-home spa treatment
it gets rid of my flakiness.
i often forget about it because it's so light weight
i love the smell, it's so pretty and soothing.
in fact i suggest doing this mask before you even think about popping pimples to reduce scaring
i usually don't like masks
it might not be the choice if your skin is super oily
i think this mask would help anyone with congested pores
i like this as a mask.
what i really love this for is spot blemish treatment
it isn't drying which is a big plus for me.
doesn't do much for the size of my pores
what's unique about this mask is that it doesn't dry into a hard
i love that there's finally a natural product that is effective to clear blemishes
easy to spread and did not bother my rosacea.
i always tend to get little tiny bumps on my cheeks
i actually apply it on my clogged pores
which says a lot because i'm a product junky!!
this mask hydrates but does not break out.
sometimes even during the day under makeup
you don't have to rinse it off
i can't wear it overnight because it works too well
i wouldn't have thought i would like it since my skin tends to be oily
i doesn't make my skin more oily
one word of warning if you leave it on for an extended period you must wash your face before you apply foundation or tinted moisturizer or you will have flaky bits on your face
i usually use it as a night cream
it doesn't make me oily
it wont make your skin oily even you wear it whole night
on really bad days i wear a thin layer of it as a straight up moisturizer under my makeup
sometimes i put it on just for the smell
it does just sit on your skin
it doesn't cause breakouts
it's a deep pore cleaning product, which i love!
so this doesn't strip my skin as hard as other charcoal based masks
it's so hard to cleanse off
show me a mud mask that isn't
i really hate that mask where you have to peel the mask off your face after
i don't take the time to review products too often
it's a bit tingly when it goes on
not painful or burning
you need this mask
it really pulls the gunk out!
no longer do i get small pimples
you can definitely tell the mask sucks out grime from your pores
lighter since the mask is sucking out all sorts of stuff
my skin doesn't seem to get as oily anymore
this doesn't burn or stings.
it sucks all the oil out of your skin
it didn't really shrink my pores much
i actually find it soothing
i don't think any product can actually permanently shrink pores
it is not greasy
don't need more acid in a mask
easy to use i can see that it's working it's magic even on my sensitive skin
the clinique mask did not irritate my skin at all
i don't feel like i have as much excess oil
i dont believe in masks as i have acne prone skin
i tend to breakout using everything.
you can literally feel like all the dirt is being pulled from yours pores
it feels like it's pulling all the dirt out of your pores
then rinses off without much fuss
when you wash it off it's the oddest sensation it's like you can feel air on your face as if a layer of grime has been lifted up
i really like this mask to help get extra gunk out of my pores
makes you look like you have no pores
i recommend right after you pat dry your face to add your favorite moisturizer
the smell does dissipate a little
i feel like a lot of reviews make it out to be this super thick goopy beauty oil
it's an indulgence that really grows on you
every so often i'll overdo it with the retin-a or lose the moisture battle to the winter
not bionic -- way too heavy
this oil on it's own does do a lot for the skin
it doesn't clog my pores
it's hard to describe the smell
not overpowering at all.
if you get regular facials like i do
it washes off really easily with no residue
my skin may look oily or even normal if you looked at me
this products (for me) sucks as a wash off mask.
figured why not just use a thin layer in the morning
surprisingly it doesn't make me look as greasy as i thought it would
it's too good not to use as a nightly moisturizer
with such sensitive skin having something so moisturizing that doesn't break you out is a heaven send
it's like magic in a jar.
the mask does seem to plump my face a bit
just cause it works for my dry skin doesn't mean it'll work for yours
for no specific reason because i have near perfect skin i just like extra steps in my beauty routine lol
smoothe like soooo smothe i couldn't stop touching my face i use this as a mask twice a week
i do not feel this mask is sticky at all
finally a nighttime moisturizer that does what it says
i never rinse it off.
i find myself opening the jar even on nights i don't use it
it's definitely become a staple is my regime
my face does not look tired or dull.
your skin feels like a baby's bum
it didn't burn when wearing
it didn't itch or tingle
this doesn't make my skin any oilier
every time i find something new disagrees with my occasionally bratty dry skin
if there's one time frugality shouldn't trump quality
it's when you're deciding what will touch your skin for months
very easily takes off all your makeup
if you use this you should use a makeup wipe on your eyes first
it removes anything i have on
what's the best is that it doesn't burn my eyes
a lot of cleansers that remove makeup as good as this one does do tend to burn or irritate my eyes
i can slather this all over my lids without any problems whatsoever
although it's not as solid as the clinique cleansing balm
it's like a nice little face massage at the end of the day
i sometimes wear a ton of makeup
the best part about this cleansing balm/oil is that it doesn't leave a greasy oil film on your skin like some oils do
the solid to a liquid means that it won't be leaking all over your stuff if you need to throw it into a bag for an overnight
this isn't meant to be your only cleanser
if you read the label it definitely says you will be left with a lotion-like layer
the one thing i didn't like its that it clogs my sensitive bathroom drain
i actually like the clinique balm because its not an oil
you know when you've made your makeup something fierce
you just don't want to take off your makeup?
it is the only makeup remover to actually remove everything
this doesn't make me excessively oily or anything
what my skin is not too fond of is the coconut oil
i usually use this as my makeup remover
love how it turns into a cleanser with some water
it takes out all your makeup
so you can work the product into your skin
you literally need a dab like oil so a little goes a long way
it's very good for removing makeup before you use your clarisonic with cleanser
i like using erborian so my skin doesn't get too dry
so you don't need to put your fingers in the jar
you really don't need to use another cleanser after
it doesn't always remove the eye make up
i love this product because it dissolves all my makeup without water
which you don't wash off
i wish it didn't have color dye in the ingredients: thus the 4 stars
if i don't rinse off very well
doesnt get in my eyes like coconut oil used to even though i really rub this over my eyes to get the makeup off
i don't wear heavy makeup
it seems strange that it isn't your typical cleanser that you would moisten your skin first
i remove most of my makeup with a cleansing cloth then grab some product about a dime to nickel sized amount with the spatula that comes with it
fresh scent that does not irritate your nose or bother you
i find if i do not add 'enough' water to lather the product on my skin
it doesn't help me control my acne too well
it comes with a little plastic spoon so you can scoop out the right amount of product without contaminating it
other marketed cleansers just did not do the trick
you can use it on the rest of your facial makeup
it takes my makeup off no problem
this really does remove everything you've applied to your face
doesn't take much to remove my makeup
it's an oil so your makeup just dissolves.
i tend to wear a lot
it's got the consistency of a transparent gel that immediately melts as soon as you touch it
still don't have a holy grain one
doesn't leave a residue like some other oils
which i didn't mind too much since i would double cleanse with another cleanser
i don't need to double-cleanse, but i usually do.
doesn't take my eye make-up off as well as other oils i've tried
beats any makeup remover wipes or anything else!
even though it is scented this cleanser did not irritate the eczema spots on my face which is an absolute plus
the packaging was too cute for me
i feel like balm make up removers are really good for dry skin which is why i tend to use them
my only complaint is that it stings my eyes a bit
there's always small residue left around my eyes.
i've always had pretty decent skin outside of the occasional hormonal outbreak
it doesn't strip my skin or leave it feeling greasy
can't use alcohol based anything
a lot of the makeup removers have that
i like how i don't have to scrub my eyes to get rid of all the makeup
clean the skin better if there's no make up on
it is gentle yet removes all my makeup.
it just smells clean to me because that's what it does
so you can imagine that i have exhausted every product in attempts to not look like a lizard
though i admit it does feel a bit weird initially rubbing this onto dry skin
i literally cannot get over this stuff
it's also the perfect makeup remover
it just melts right into your skin
there is no greasy film afterwards
this stuff is a lot thicker than most cleansing oils when you apply it to the skin
does seem to melt off makeup
the only reason i'm not giving 5 stars is that it didn't transform into a silky cleanser after
but i guess this isn't your traditional cleanser.
unlike some serious cleansers that leave your face feeling stripped of oils
it definitely leaves a sheer residue on your skin
i don't even have to use eye makeup remover for it to get rid of my mascara
anyhow it was less noticeable after i dried my face which usually never happens after just using face wash
it doesn't remove all the makeup though which is fine for me
so far it hasn't clogged my pores
it's meant as a pre-cleanse.
it doesn't look like it all came off until you rub
i find this solid cleansing oil does not remove all of my makeup at the end of the day
i love the balm formula i feel like it really removes all of my makeup without being to thick
it completely melts even the most stubborn makeup off
like don't get it in your eye
doesn't burn or sting on my combination skin
this product doesn't foam
my face can sometimes get itchy
my skin doesn't have dry patches anymore.
doesn't feel like it would cleanse because it is a solid oil
it feels oily, but it isn't.
i don't want use anything to strong to clean my face
it's great for oily skin
you only need a little to cleanse your face with.
make sure your fingers aren't wet if you do choose to scoop it out with your fingers
because it will mess up the texture of the product in your jar
as this product does stick to your lashes
will make your eyes burn
i think i will stick to my liquid
i literally can't wait to wash my face everyday with this cleanser
t is perfect as i don't get that tight feeling after use
it's very easy to wash off
hardly anything makes a difference or it makes my makeup look so dry
horrible that i would rather take the oily skin
what i like about this is that it doesn't feel as drying like mattifying primers like mufe or becca
it doesn't cause my makeup to drag like those ones
if you've ever used the becca ever matte primer
it isn't on my face
u don't want to put this under your eyes or get it on your lips
like the way it makes my aging skin look
i will say that this face creme is thick-- thick like you either put on too much or feel like you didn't use enough to distri
it's not sticky or heavy.
for about two years i had milia on my eyelid that made me feel like i always had to wear eyeliner to cover it
after trying countless eye creams this one not only got rid of the milia
bags under my eyes seem less
my dark circles are bad
wanted to get somethings to prevent aging
a lot of eye creams are either too light or too thick
therefore do not match up well with concealer
i think it's totally worth it for the ability to make your concealer not crease or flake
let it sit like a mask
even then it doesn't overly dry my skin
my pores are not as clean, even after a day.
when my pores are bothering me
there's something very luxurious about massaging the formula into your skin for a few minutes
otherwise it will melt
i've always had dull skin with breakouts since i wear tons of makeup
helps your skin texture even out
not a liquid/gel/foam whatever so less chance of a mess
i loved how i didn't have to dig the wash out of a jar with my long nails
the only thing is that it didn't really clean my blackheads or shrink my pores
it's a bit sticky going on
i do not find that it pulls my blackheads out or is really deep-pore cleansing
i don't have any acne
i can literally feel it pulling the blackheads out of my face when i use it
doesn't irritate my skin at all
it's not harsh on the skin
cleansers usually just do nothing
its not a scrub or anything
it's not iverdrying either like a lot of other acne products
i also wish they'd add more charcoal bits into the cleanser
it really pulls everything to the surface to clear out pores
i guess i was pressing too hard against my face just like how you use deodorant under your arms because there was this black
have no issues with "ruining the whole thing into a globby mess
in conjunction with moisturizer i don't have any real problems with flakiness
my makeup even seems to apply more matte now
after you've used it
it does remove a lot
you want it to stay a bit thick
nothing my moisturizer couldn't fix
it's much thicker than your typical cleanser
i m thankful for her it resolves my problem of acne which happens because of clogged pores
i decided to give this a try even though it stated good for normal/oily skin
it gets really deep into the pores without irritating the skin
i did seem not to be as oily as in the past
even though you're supposed to rinse
i don't use it everyday
because i've read that it tends to be drying if you use it everyday
the trick is making sure not to get the product itself wet
this is great because they're no bar container or fears of pumps leaking or any leaking at all because of its solid state
don't let it dry it will ruin the bar on you
the whole packaging is useless garbage to me!
since i don’t have oily skin i decided to just use it 2-3 a week
this stick is easy
only because it was getting the crud out of my pores
i usually put some product on my face
it's gotten all my break outs under control
the packaging leave something to be desired so that's why there's one star off
i like the fact that my skin doesn't feel dry afterwards
no other products actually cleans everything either
haven't been able to get rid of residual pimples now that i'm an adult
i am almost 100% sure they are not applying a moisturizer after cleansing
yet oily at the same time?
this stick does the trick
the product does not work so well if you apply it after wetting your skin
changing how often i do or don't exfoliate
if you use a clarisonic it helps if you just wet the brush
it can get a little messy but i don't mind it.
that they're literally applying it like a glue stick to their skin — no
will be good for traveling since it's not a liquid
i don't mind the stick form.
i don't think it's that messy
both of us tend to break out myself occasionally
i do recommend using your fingers
if it's not wet enough
i've had blackheads for as long as i can remember
it is a bit hard to just apply it as a stick so you should wet your face before using the product or else it will be thick
kind of stick to your face like mud
this stuff sticks where you rub it
sometimes i have congestion on my nose
it kind of just smushed the actual product around
while it looks like it is the size of a tube of chapstick that would easily maneuver around your nose
it's not so easy to zip round the nose
this stuff cuts through makeup
i don't rub it directly on my face
it does seem to minimize pores too
i think it's pretty genius for application--compared to the charcoal liquid heating cleanser from boscia
the only annoying thing is that the suds are grey
not like a bar of soap
this moisturizer gel literally melts into what feels like a water as you apply it
thick creams didn't seem to do anything
maybe it's because i love to look matte.
if you wanna glow, get this.
moisturizers usually break me out horribly
it's the perfect moisturizer for my combo oily breakout prone skins type
finally a moisturizer that doesn't irritate my sensitive
i don't know how this watery gel works
the scent doesn't bother me the way it has some other reviewers
doesn't take much to smooth on
your complexion will love it too
the smell is a bit alcohol-like
you won't want your face to feel heavy or clogged up with a thick moisturizer
doesn't leave my face tacky or too wet
it won't make my face look oiler
seems weird to apply it like an aftershave
first of all it comes in a pump so it's hygenic.
it doesn't have that sticky feeling
i can see oily gals
refreshing when you pat it on your skin
i can't get over how great my skin texture is
it's just enough moisture
doesn't feel heavy on the skin
it's perfect for my skin because it isn't heavy
doesn't feel heavy or greasy at all
it doesn't smell like other lancome products
it does not clog pores at all.
yet somehow non-greasy
it doesn't make my skin oily or break out
i didn't notice it to be tacky at all
maybe on oily skin it feels like this
the tacky feel never went away
it doesn't break me out or cause overproduction of oil
as it was light enough to not mess with my bb cream
i would recommend this oil to those who are super oily
i don't think any topical products can do that
i just don't like the feeling or appearance
don't like the greasy texture that takes forever to absorb u must ask for a sample
love that it isn't too greasy
it's not greasy at all
does not feel oily after applied
the only con is that my face feels sticky
like ithe oil never completely sinks into the skin
even after my moisturizer my face is still tacky
it's true that it leaves a little bit of tackiness on your skin
i also like the feeling of having a little layer of honey on my face
t's hard to find a facial oil that doesn't make my face feel oily
t's hard to find anti-aging products that dont aggravate acne
who is usually quick to complain about any strong perfumy smells
it's become a part of my skin care routine.
you don't have to slather this stuff on
i sometimes get dark spots
leave it on for the 30 minutes your skin will look georgeous
can't rave enough about this mask!
it's great if you have a bit of dry or dead skin on your face
it also smells like candy so that's a plus!
you want ridiculous soft
i wouldn't consider this an instant brightening mask
it does take the dullness away
it not only brightens
which is fine i don't expect it to be a miracle worker where my freckles will go away
this may seem weird
i don't have to use this often on my bottom
it didn't irritate my skin at all
this mask does work
you wash your face like normal.
i never did my research on what each glam glow mask did for you
i didn't really massage it into my skin
worth a try if you want to brighten your skin
if you like the algenist mask
i would recommend this to someone who is looking to lighten dark spots
it doesn't irritate my skin
this mask is everything!!
it's all thanks to this mask
my skin almost craves this mask now.
even your skin tone
as you rub it in
i don't typically like this sort of mask.
however it doesn't really target pimples or acne
this is a quick way where you can get rid of oil
not to be confused with a make up remover
these wipes make it sooooooo easy
be sure not to let it contact your lips as it does exfoliate
did not rinse it off
i didn't know what to do to stop the dryness i used my normal moisturizers
now my face feels as smooth as a baby's bum
chest to avoid body acne that he gets if he doesn't wash the sweat off
it has one side that's smooth
because of my dry skin i don't think they'd be good for everyday use
love using it when my skin looks dull.
i didn't like the smell or feel of this mask
at first i thought there is no way this tiny foil packet will do everything it says
you can feel your skin stretching as it dries
don't expect some sort of life changing de-wrinkling
i don't usually see results from any face products
it's just way too pricy
i took a star away because it's a very expensive moisturizer
doesn't leave my face greasy
it does burn a little bit on my cheeks when i first apply it
washing it off can be hard sometimes
i think it's because i use a thick layer
would recommend to anyone who has any type of textured skin
even though i don't struggle with texture
this is the mask for you!
it doesn't strip your face
does clear out your pores
i really like the little beads that help exfoliate when you wash it off
it's like a 2 in 1 because after using the mask
is not harsh on your skin
it's very easy to wash off
now that it's in my beauty routine
it's works with my skin
it does not irritate my skin or makes it look red whatsoever
i love i this face mask because it's not super expensive
if you go about your normal skin care routine after you'll be fine
just after one use this mask made my skin so soft it's ridiculous
after putting on my regular moisturizer i didn't have any bumps or texture at all
doesn't leave my face feeling desert-like
i only have two pimples that are kind of there
this mask did not irritate my skin
i can't wait to try your other masks!
fresh without feeling like there's product trapped in your skin
it doesn't leave my skin dried out like lots of other masks
it's like clear improvements girlfriend <3
this is not necessarily hydrating
it didn't burn my skin
you'll see it for yourself once you see the smooth
this mask not only smells amazing it also draw out impurities without making my skin feeling tight
it doesn't irritate my skin at all
i typically hate masks
although it does a good job of clearing my pores
it doesn't do much for softening my skin
my skin gets really dull sometimes
just washing it isn't enough
if i want to exfoliate a little more
it leaves your skin really even and clean.
i can't stop touching my face today
it's a staple in any collection
every time i use this mask my skin looks
it's doesn't make my chin break out here
you don't feel any dryness at all
i feel like regular use of this would lighten that discoloration
you're suppose to gently rub it off to exfoliate after you let it sit for ten minutes
this mask is everything you need in a mask!
now my boyfriend won't stop kissing my face because it's so soft
although the description is for smoothing fine lines i use it because it sucks out all my pimples
did help the pores out a bit
makeup tends to just sit on my face
i am so used to using a washcloth when i use the 10-minute problem skin mask that i was using a washcloth with this one too
their stuff maybe pricey
not a big fan of anything scented
doesn't leave a shiny finish
it has a tendency to get shiny as the day goes
i don't wear make-up most days
you don't smell it all day on your face
does not make my face greasy/shiny at the same time
it works great on combination skin without overdrying or making my face too oily
i usually wear it under my foundation
it does not leave any sort of white tint that sun screen can sometimes leave
it is non-comedogenic which is great because my skin gets oilier as the day goes on
sometimes it's best to stick with what works
otherwise it feels like oily
when i do use it all over doesn't make my t-zone too oily
doesn't make my skin look too shiny or oily
it is the only spf that doesn't clog my pores
it's great to wear under makeup or alone.
doesn't add more oil to my skin
the smell isn't bad
don't need anti-aging just yet
the only moisturizer with spf that doesn't break me out
it's a little bit thicker than moisturizers that i usually use
yet not comedogenic spf lotion is one of the only ones my skin doesn't resist in the morning
can't wear anything too heavy or i break out
does not break me out or clog pores
even with spf not greasy and sticky at all!
love these little pods!
if you don't apply it thick you'll be able to get a lot of uses in
wouldn't leave any residue on my pillow
after a few days the product becomes a weird sticky/tacky consistency
what it does i loooooove this product it's become a go-to in my beauty regimen
if you put too much mask on your face it will remain tacky
t wasn't prone to drying up so easily
for those saying it's too sticky
you're applying wayyyy too much
it didn't have an overpowering
i didn't usually use it as a sleeping mask
kind of obsessed with this.
it's super lightweight and does not break me out!
i recommend buying if you don't mind overnight face masks
one little tub gave me 5-7ish uses
it wasn't sticky at all
combination skin so for me to find a product that doesn't irritate me is a huge plus
as long as you avoid your pillow
it's not that sticky compared to other sleeping masks i've used
i even use it as moisturizer in the morning too
i don't use all of the formula in one day because it's rich enough with small amounts
even though it isnt even really marketed for acne/bumps
it's good for at least 3-4 uses
try this mask if you have dry skin or if you need soothing on the face
night masks so you dont have to peel or wash off a bunch of clay
even though i am not a fan of rose scent
(you'll get about 4-6 uses out of each).
usually it's somewhat oily
i didn't break out with my normal to oily skin.
this mask works wonders for me without feeling super heavy
it's not resealable so you need to put it in a ziplock or put a item on top of it
you can't beat the price of $4 which is probably why it's not resealable
i wouldn't nessecary call it a typical "mask" though
there's about 3-4 uses per container so a lot of bang for your buck
it's the only thing i have found that has reduced my pores
there's zero need to wash it off the next morning since there's no residue
it's a gel formula that isn't greasy at all.
the only ones i can tell a difference with tho is the green tea
it doesn't feel cakey or slimey.
they give my skin just enough moisture
it dried my hormonal breakout that was going insane
i keep it in a little ziplock
can't wait to try the pore minimizing one
there's a lot in the actual container
it's really improves my makeup application
the next day my skin was not as oily as usual
if you're sensitive to smells maybe avoid this particular one
doesn't feel sticky on your skin
definitely recommend it for anyone with oily skin
does what it says it will do without clogging my pores
after a long day of work my face was not oily.
it's cuts down on the shiny appearance.
i know longer have an oil slick t-zone by lunchtime
my makeup stays on all day which is not easy for someone with extremely oily skin like mine
like an hour after you do your makeup you're blotting
using powder you need this in your life
i wear this as a primer
you have to rub your eyes a bit
the oil does not irritate
i don't even feel that a second cleanse is even necessary
this oil takes all of my makeup off so easy
it doesn't burn the eyes
it can leave eyes a little blurry
i don't need "special" "curated" ingredients for something that's literally being washed away
it takes off all my waterproof longwear makeup.
it doesn't rinse totally clean
it doesn't leave any residue
you only need 1-2 pumps of this stuff.
i just wish the spf version wasn't so greasy
if you're sensitive to smells you may want to smell it before you purchase
it smells amazing and doesn't irritate my skin.
takes off all of my makeup including anything waterproof
anyone who wears it knows it's stubborn to get off
there's no residue or tight feeling after
all lipstick for that matter
it doesn't leave a film once you wash it off
doesn't burn your eyes
there's no pulling on the face like i felt with the josie maran one
the oil turns into a lotion-like substance which honestly i was skeptical about
doesn't feel too thick compared to the boscia br
i do prefer the boscia makeup breakup as i find it actually removes more makeup
with both products i find that i still need to use eye makeup remover no matter what
as the oil just doesn't have the power to remove it all
it isn't bothersome either
needless to say it's probably one of my favorite cleansers on the planet
even though i have oily skin i like for an oil to be my first step when i clean my face
you might think an oil cleanser will make your face oily
i just wouldn't use this as my only face cleanser because it's not that great at cleaning out pores
although it's an oil
it does not leave my face feeling oily
it makes my skin feel so good that i don't need to follow up with any facial wash after rinsing
i love how it turns into a lotion consistency when you add a tiny bit of water
i usually follow with a cleanser, too.
i feel like it really dissolves all my makeup esp my long wearing foundations that don't move with regular makeup remover wipes
it does not irritate my eyes
doesn't irritate my skin
sometimes i apply with a sponge
it doesn't leave a residue
its not really filmy
i rub it over my eyes even though i have sensitive eyes
this melts your makeup right off!
didn't leave my skin feeling the least bit oily
i like that it's a thicker oil
it's less likely to come shooting out of the pump
although it's not so great at completely removing long wearing eye liner
this doesn't foam up as well as some other oil cleansers
the biggest drawback to this oil is that it doesn't remove every speck of makeup from my face
does not burn my eyes
it does not require me to scrub my face to remove any product
doesn't even irritate my contacts
it's enough to remove all of make make up including eyeliner
it does make my contacts a little blurry if it gets in my eye
it is pretty pricey for a make up remover in my opinion
two pumps that's all you need.
fyi----you need go with a regular face wash after using any kind makeup remove oil
so in love with this cleansing oil!
doesn't leave my skin tight
it's the first product that actually made a difference in my puffy undereyes
i truly cannot stop touching my skin.
even without makeup i'm looking goooood!
this is one of the few eye treatments that didn't burn or make my eyes water
must buy if you have dullness or dark circle / dark spots issues
of course i didn't expect my pigmentation to disappear
i didn't even need moisturizer after
mouth are definitely not as droopy once i apply this
the trick is to not layer many products over it because just like regular tape it can cause the product to slip
this oil does wonders for my skin
doesn't make my face feel greasy when used under makeup during the day
my skin breaks out or gets irritated immediately when it doesn't like the product
it goes on oily obviously it is an oil
knew my skin wasn't oily everywhere
didn't even break out during my hormone cycles
i don't have to pat my face during the day to absorb excess oil on my t-zone either
it doesn't feel heavy
doesn't cause any shine
this stuff actually plumps it up
i always found them way too greasy for my acne-prone face
not so greasy that my oily patches shine like the top of the chrysler building
just make sure your fingers are super clean before you dip them into the product or else you'll leave bacteria in there for the next time you use it
this product can be applied multiple times a day without feeling greasy or overdone
my face is basically a cute baby's bum.
this is the only moisturizer that i can use twice a day without making my skin feel greasy or oily
you only need a little bit because your skin will simply eat it up
this moisturizer has not let me down
it is a little to rich for my skin as i get adult acne
however my only qualm is that it feels like there is a thin film on my face even after about 30 minutes post-application
is you do have to have a skin care routine for this product
it will clog your pores if you're not exfoliating your face
two areas that i can't use body moisturizers because of break outs
there are a lot of moisturizers that do as soon as they touch my skin
my face doesn't feel tight
it do leave your skin a little dewy
i simply love this moisturizer.
i still get some shiny areas on my face
it's not too heavy
doesn't roll up with serum underneath.. love it
it's not greasy and absorbs quickly.
it's has all the things i love about the lotion formula just slightly thicker
acne prone if i use the wrong product
doesn't make my skin feel greasy or oily
i no longer have flakes when i wear makeup
do not have any problems with my skin besides some dryness
if you've gotten crows feet it will take longer
it does sting when you're using
don't let the stinging feeling or redness turn you off
it's quick and easy in my opinion.
i didn't have wrinkles
it's kind of like micro peeling so you can't see it
my dark circles weren't that bad to begin with though
you will feel some burning after a treatment
it did sting a bit
moisturizer or just use it alone
i simply drop the oils on the surface of my face
doesn't make you look super oily by mid-day
could mix it with my coverfx foundation since it's so thick
my undereyes always look chalky even with high end concealer
if i don't use powder
t doesn't weigh my skin down whatsoever
it's not greasy either!
the foundation does not crack or have that greasy heavy cake
it's not greasy & absorbs nicely.
don't leave a greasy feeling afterwards
it doesn't leave a greasy finish
it doesn't feel like i have a "mask" on my face
they do not leave my fave feeling oily
that even applying more moisturizer was not helping my flaky skin
with the oil infused my foundation isn't drying out my skin anymore
it seem to help me with my redness
adding it to my cc cream thins it just enough to avoid that weird chalkiness that emphasizes my pores
doesn't look oily at all
it's not a heavy or greasy feel at all
it's just less messy that way
doesn't make my skin greasy
the smell is amazing and it's so cooling.
it doesn't irritate me
red skin you need this in your life
potions have done you wrong
not oily love it love i can use it in place of a primer
it's also really soothing to my skin when it's irritated from acne treatments
i mean i am oily like even after 2 hours of applying my makeup
it just doesn't feel like my typica moisturizer that i'm used to
how it's got natural ingredients
i would rarely get any pimples
it didn't leave it feeling oily
t doesn't really have a fragrance which i love because i tend to get headaches easily from that kind of stuff
doesn't leave behind any residue
it does go on a little sticky
i probably wouldn't reccomend puttung underneath makeup unless you have time for it to dry
i woke up not oily like i usually do
i couldn't put makeup on them
it's clears my breakouts though there are no acne fighting ingredients
does not feel sticky at all
doesn't give me the "wow" dewy look i was hoping for
does not make me oily or cause me to break out
the sephora i was at didn't carry the moisturizer i use
i hate greasy formulas or formulas that do not seem to absorb
some days i even skip my primer!
mine was i wish i could find a moisturizer that would hydrate my oily skin without any problems
le anything too heavy
dont need a makeup primer after applying this
i wear it alone on lazy days or under foundation.
doesn't leave me shiny under my makeup
as usual, philosophy doesn't disappoint.
finicky skin means most spf creams leave me a mess
don't even wear foundation everyday now
this is the first moisturizer i've ever used that didn't irritate my skin or make me break out
it's on the pricey side
i don't mind the smell
it didn't clog my pores
the reviews on here saying it made you greasy are untrue- you only need a pea size amount to cover your face
doesn't irritate my skin
i don't like the hope in a jar
i don't think it's caused new breakouts
my skin usually looks dull
i do not use one ounce of makeup
i do not like strong odors
i like that it is not greasy and thick.
it doesn't weight my skin down like some face creams
cheap skin to try to fix the problem
can't wait to try the eye cream
how many products have you tried that supposedly "melt" into your skin?
i don't really have issues with puffiness
she uses the face cream too
the line seem to fade
if you want less wrinkles
this stuff hydrates my skin like nothing else.
yes it stings if you are not accustomed to glycolic
to those who complain about it being greasy
the moisturizer is a bit tacky right after you put it on
sure it feels like snot when you scoop it out
not oily like it usually is
it has never made me oily or break out
if you use to much it will feel oily
this is sake infused so don't be surprised if it smells a little boozy
it's supposed to be white
it doesn't sting on my skin
always struggle to find a moisturizer that doesn't break me out
i can't blame the cream for my sensitivity
it's changed my life!!
it can be a little "sticky" or tacky on the skin after immediate use
i've gotta say it's even better as a warm weather
i do not feel it's sticky at all
it's a jelly type moisturizer that goes on very smooth
i think if you are normal to oily you should give it a shot
if i feel like it's too dry i put another moisturizer over it
it's not sticky whatsoever
never notice anything sticky on my face
doesn't leave it oily looking even with the extra moisture
it's so light weight
it is hard to find one that doesn't leave your face like an oil slick
really sinks into your sink which is great for oily skin
this product does not irritate me or make me more oily
doesn't leave any residue
it can get sticky if you use too much
you'd have to wait for it to completely dry
it's not sticky and a bounce back formula.
so light weight and not sticky.
i think it would be great alone on oily skin.
pat it on, don't rub.
it does feel sticky
protects your skin all through the night no matter how often u tub your face on your pillow/sheets
it's way better than those oily face lotions.
the only thing to be aware of is that it is a bit alcohol-y in that it burns if you put it on any sort of broken/cracked skin
it's usually really oily when i use moisturizer
i am not a fan of thick creams that sit on my face
it doesn't have an spf which i like
doesn't leave a residue or heavy feeling
creams because they always make me more oily
face creams suck to try out
i don't think it's the most hydrating product out there
that it's not greasy
i love this product -- it doesn't leave me greasy
it is not sticky5.
looking bright enough to not have to wear makeup
it's really light and not greasy at all.
buy this if you have scars!
it's no longer red and it's super soft.
know skin products can do very little for you skin cells
those superrr annoying little tiny bumps
it doesn't irritate my skin at all
nothing so bad that it make my makeup patchy or my face stick to my pillow
may feel a bit sticky on the pillow at night
doesn't feel like i am just layering more product on my face
yes it is a bit sticky for awhile
i usually hate boscia products
those folks who say that this product is sticky
yes it is a bit sticky at first but abates.
i probably use about a teaspoon for my entire face
i applied before bed as when you first put it on your face the texture may feel a little sticky rather than slick or greasy like other facial moisturizers because of the gel texture
have been careful not to slather my face in this product
it is heavy, but i am in love.
i do notice if i don't wash my face in the morning it can look a bit shiny
it does tingle going on
it doesn't leave it looking oily
it's like my pores have been blurred.
it's a night time product
#cheap but a girl does not need puffy eyes!
i didn't find this eye cream sticky at all.
i did not like the nighttime gel in this product line
there is no eye cream that can provide instant gratification when it comes to eye wrinkles
this cream will tingle a bit when you put it on
it doesn't leave behind any unwanted texture
thankfully i don't have any deep crowsfeet or eye wrinkles
it absorbs really well and doesn't stay greasy.
work full time so tend to get puffy under the eyes pretty regularly
it's said to be a morning eye cream
i mean tiniest bit
i can wear it alone or under makeup
otherwise it does have a tendency to be a bit heavy under makeup
it's fine for day under makeup
my normal moisturizer wasn't doing jack to help the condition
non-greasy feel when i apply it
it does tingle a bit so might not be right for those with sensitive eyes
does not hide the wrinkles
it takes so much concealer to cover them
now i deal w/ puffiness too.
it's not a miracle cream
did not experience any makeup smudging that other reviewers have experienced
so don't be afraid to ask your sephora sales person for a heaping sample
today i can actually wear a little mascara without my eyes looking all creppy
the cream does not sting me at all.
i didn't even wear concealer over this!
i don't think it does anything for wrinkles or fine lines
it's thicker than other night creams i've used.
i don't have to deal with wrinkles or fine lines yet
can't comment on how well this cream works for fighting aging
i would try this cream before going to any super expensive creams to see how it works for you
not sure if it's reducing darkness
i don't tend towards dark circles so can't comment on that
does seem to fill in the wrinkles
it is so hard to find an eye cream that does not use cucumber to depuff
it's got a subtle scent so that might be what irritates the eyes
it stays where it's supposed to while you're sleeping
what i like most is that it doesn't seem to cause too much morning puffiness
not too thick or too watery
i wouldn't skip a morning or night.
sometimes i decide to change my eye cream
this is the first eye balm i've found that doesn't cause my eyes to itch
i require that it not make my eye area look greasy or shiny
i will get probably 100 applications out of this little tub
i don't think it does much for under eye darkness or puffiness or wrinkles
not sure if it's preventing wrinkles
some products that i have used actually leave my skin feeling dryer
if you don't have sensitve skin
t doesn't make your eye makeup smear
doesn't have much of a scent
it's not sticky at all
dark circles seem to be hereditary as i always get enough sleep
my eyes don't look so drawn
may be too light if you need moisture around your eyes
also it doesn't burn like a lot of eye creams.
this is not the balm for you
make-up doesn't smudge
i don't think there's any product to completely rid someone of dark circles
i wouldn't describe it as a balm though
i don't have much wrinkles around my eyes
when i don't get enough sleep
i can't go to sleep without putting it on!
they either sting or they don't work very well with my makeup
it is not filmy or scenty
not sticky after you message for a while.
for years i couldn't use any eye cream.
not sure if it's actually been reducing puffiness
everything you want in an eye cream: easy to apply
my dark circles disappear even though i don't get a lot of sleep
doesn't irritate my eyes or contact lenses
i surely can see the benefits: my puffy eyes are gone
i don't recommend it if you have oily skin
i do not have a problem with dark circles or puffiness
i would think this balm would perk these problems right up
or it will produce a pimple on the spot
i don't beleive greasy heavy eye creams necessarily deliver results
they can be irritating to my eyes
all of the skin care products i used made my skin freak out
other eye creams that i have tried were so thick the cream would actually start to form little crumbles
it's nice and light and not too thick.
i love this cream is not greasy at all
there are many creams i can't use on my face without breaking out or feeling greasy
i love that it comes in a glass jar too.
i'd use it as a night cream because it can be a little thick for under makeup
i really like thicker creams now that i'm into my forties
you'll feel too lotiony/slick
it does feel a little sticky
am sure it's because i am using this precious cream
it's a little on the pricey side
did not make my combo skin oily at all
it's rich but not heavy.
i even use it on my lips
a quick fix for any rough spots you might have on your face- for me it's the sides of my nose
the ingredients are good at fighting the wrinkles too
it just plain works
makeup can be applied over it without the cheesy residue
it's not greasy and stays on long.
it's the only moisterizer i've used that really lasts all day
not greasy at all
if you cake it on
one layer of this cream does what it takes many layers of other creams to do
this is the only creme i have found that actually balances out my skin
the store has lousy visuals for it--they are constantly moving it around
pick this one over the precious cream with the spf added to it--the spf tends to make the cream a bit "sticky
it isn't too greasy for daytime.
my skin drinks this stuff up
i seem to break out with every anti-aging moisturizer i've every tried-dozens of them-until i tried this
immortelle precious cream is going to be my "forever" moisturizer
otherwise tend to be oily
it's light enough to be a day cream too
i dont want anything to thick
also dont want anything too thin that won't do anything for my semi dry skin
even though this product isn't labelled for acne treatment
feel like they're clogging my pores
it's probably too soon to see the antiaging benefits
my skin does seem to be glowing more
it doesn't irritate my skin
this product also doesn't have any fragrance in it
t doesn't irritate my already sensitive skin
it absorbs quickly and does not feel oily at all.
doesn't leave you looking shiny
it's light, but not too light.
doesn't leave an oil slick on my skin
doesn't cause my skin to break out
it's not greasy, or drying.
very light-- beware the product goes bad easily in the heat as i've noticed from some of the testers in a few loccitane shops without a/c
while it did help with my flakey skin a bit
it wasn't heavy enough to withst
not greasy even for combination skin.
even my oily/combination skin just sucks it in
eyes seeming not as deep
everything irritates my combination skin
isn't enough for winter nights
great formula - doesn't clog pores or get oily.
normally i don't like really scent-y lotions
it is not greasy
this stuff is like a miracle in a jar.
it doesn't clog my oily spots
this doesn't leave it looking red
it's weird--putting on as mask
it washes off so easy because of the mask to cleanser aspect
doesn't feel at all harsh
this mask is perfect for you if you're in a rush
did an okay job with my blackheads
sometimes they irritates my skin
my blackheads have proven nigh impossible to get rid of
the blackheads would not leave
sometimes i use a makeup wipe first
it does not burn, sting or cause redness for me.
let it sit for a few minutes then add splashes of h20 to make a nice froth to remove makeup
i feel this is almost the lazy girls' way to wash your face while receiving additional benefits
it smells like baby powder if i had to describe it
usually wear makeup everyday
if i'm too lazy to hop in the shower this stuff does an amazing job of taking off my makeup without over drying my skin
you barely have to use anything to cover your entire face
it's not too harsh on my skin
it's a quick mask for those days when your skin just isn't having it
i love that it even removes makeup.
which a lot of clay masks tend to do to my skin
i don't know of a lot of mask to cleanser products
it's like a mask and wash in one.
i tend to be messy over the sink
doesn't make my face feel painfully tight
i don't wear that.
i rarely need a primer
for those with milia ....you will love this !
i don't think this mask makes a huge difference in my skin when i use it compared with other clay masks
sometimes i'll use it as a mask
the pink one everywhere else
i love that they're gentle and remove oil.
it's nice to not have to spend a bunch of time washing the mask off
my face doesn't feel irritated after using any of them
once my moisturizer is on theres no more problem
they're a little bit drying
this doesn't even irritate it
didn't find the pink mask to be that effective
just like a clay mask should.
clean it zero oil cleanser on my t zone
it's like a mini indulgence every time
this is a long time for me as my pores clog very easily
it doesn't feel like this painful chemical step system it's a very quick natural remedy
if you dont have acne
annoying ones that you can't even squeeze out
somedays my skin is so oily that i can blot a lot of oil off throughout the day
i like the fact that you have 3 cleansing masks in the package
i would've wanted this to be more like a rinse off mask
don't irritate my skin
i really like these cleansing masks
simply used this product instead of my typical face wash
i think everyone should try this product because it's inexpensive
not too much that it makes your skin super greasy
don't know what possessed me to buy this mask-to-cleanser set as it appears to need more effort than your usual cleanser
it's like a mini mask for me!
so your face doesn't get all sucked out of moisture
it makes it easy to mask
i don't really thinks there's much of a difference between the 3 masks besides color
i feel like it's just a face wash you apply-a little does a long way btw
these masks aren't going to change your skin's life by any means
work well and don't irritate skin.
so easy to wash off
the only con i can think of is that it seems to sting my eyes
this foams up you can see it working feels lite
it's not overpowering enough to stick around
doesn't interfere with the rest of my routine
it doesn't strip skin further or irritate it
after a while i noticed that it's just really cleaning your skin
doesn't break my out
this cleanser foams a ton with very little product on just a few drops of water or even just rubbing it in your h
i mean instantly less red
you don't really need to actually splash your face it's more like keeping your fingers wet while working in the product more
does not irritate my combination skin
it's not necessarily hydrating
it doesn't irritate my skin.
it makes your face feel squeaky clean
just a dab will lather up your whole face
does get all of your makeup off
i believe that's just part of the ritual: feeling you're pampering yourself
i notice that it doesn't look oily
rice enzyme polish have literally transformed my skin in a way i didn't think was possible
doesn't sit on top of your skin
it made my combination skin look
i would get flakey patches when i use foundation
i actually use this product to smooth the lines on my lips
my skin seemed dull and not as plump.
it's not at all noticeable once you apply it on your face other than that you look really dewy
not sticky like some serums can be
doesn't feel heavy or sicky
this is not irritating
the dropper doesn't do a good job at picking up any of the product
so you have to dip like 3 times to get enough to cover you face
i tend to get chapped skin too
it never tried me out since it's like a lotion
can usually get one drop out
wasn't using a serum anymore i noticed a huge difference
the bottle dispenser is quite annoying
or remove the lines like this does
it's expensive but it does work.
except for my moisturizer cream which i sometimes apply either more than one layer of or one out of a few that i choose from depending on how my skin feels dryness-wise that day
is not just sitting in some sort of layer of products on my face
i can even say that i feel it slightly reduced my large pore size in the area around my nose scrunch lines
i know it's important to have a delivery system that isn't contaminated by fingers
i seriously can't believe how gorgeous my skin looks
i can't speak to the deep wrinkle-fighting properties as i don't really have any
does not leave me looking shiny
didn't feel at all sticky
i sometimes forget to use moisturizer
these pads seem to really be softening the lines around my eyes
my face doesn't look greasy
it doesn't smell artificial
i don't find it overpowering
the only downside is that the smell can be a bit overpowering
it does really melt into your skin
t ends up feeling more like you are applying a liquid
i love how it comes out in a foam
i can wear this cream alone without foundationit makes my face look really healthy plus i no longer have dry skin
not as a night cream
my skin does not feel dry anymore
$35 for an eye cream isn't bad either
don't forget each morning when i drink my orange juice
this is the only thing that helps with my puffiness
dark circles seem less dark.
it isn't greasy at all
unlike the image it doesn't come with a brush
even a mild moisturizer makes them look greasy in couple of hours
does not make my skin look greasy even after hours
what i love about this is that it helps with the flare ups
i can wear pink-based lip gloss again without it making my whole face look pink
i don't even wear make-up most days
however my t-zones occasionally get oily
as i usually get a pimple once in a while
in the ginormous pile of once-used products that were a no-no for me
it does indeed work against redness
which isn't so much oily
bottom line, it's healing.
it's now a staple morning and night.
it takes me forever to find products that my skin won't react to
it doesn't feel thick or heavy
with this a color correcting primer i finally feel like my skin looks semi-normal
my skin is not as red
never irritates my contacts
this is the only thing that keeps my acne at bay
this cleanser does not make my face feel over cleansed or dried out
just seems a bit pricey for a face wash
i would imagine people with oily skin would benefit from it
it doesn't lather up so crazy
not heavy or greasy
i like that it's okay to use around the eye area
doesn't clog my pores
my only complaint is if you're lazy like me
don't wash your face in the morning you can look a little shiny
usually if i don't use a moisturizer my skin gets really bad
does not have yucky ingredients i avoid
i love the name nourish because that is exactly what it does for my skin
it is not sticky
i noticed that my makeup doesn't cake up when i use it because my skin is so hydrated
with that i guess you don't get the glow
you need it in your life
i didn't love it or the weird texture my skin developed
it's so much better than any topical acne cream i've tried
it goes on like a primer
it doenst irritate or cause redness for me i use it twice a day
it tingles a little when you 1st apply
i gave 4 stars because i can't really speak on the anti wrinkle i'm young
my face does still tingle when i use it
i can't tell you how many eye creams i have purchased over the years
this is the only one that doesn't make my eyes water
my makeup doesn't settle in my wrinkles either
don't love it under makeup
it would come off in like a weird paste
making me even more oily
the gel consistency is what keeps my skin in check when it's still oily
i don't necessarily love the thick feel of the original cream formula on my face during the day
i stopped getting those little bumps from clogged pores even though i wear makeup everyday
stinging after a bit too much aha use
that doesn't aggravate breakouts
jart's moisturizer is several levels beyond that in amazing-ness
it's like my face took a drink of water.
you wont feel like your skin is moisturized because it absorbs very quickly if applied correctly
hate having heavy feeling moisturizers on my face that leave me feeling greasy
feels amazing on my sometimes irritated skin from retin-a use
i didn't use this over the ceramidin liquid
most moisturizers either make me break out or don't moisturize enough
t doesn't clog pores
when not wearing makeup
it definitely doesn't leave me shiny tho which is a big plus for my combo skin
is not at all greasy
doesn't absorb right away
doesn't feel thick or heavy at all!
i can't judge how well it works on wrinkles after just one packet
this product doesn't have a scent to me--it doesn't smell badly at all
it has a distinct scent that i can't quite put my finger on
it's not greasy yet takes makeup off smoothly
i usually use boscia makeup breakup
it does not sting my eyes
it's more conditioning deep without being sticky than sk-ii clear lotion
it becomes like an oil it actually smells goood
the fact that it doesn't lather means that it's not stripping my skins natural moisture
can feel it's using natural ingredients
since i'm oily i can only attest that it works amazingly for me
i usually don't like gel masks because i feel like they don't do much
it doesn't strip my skin
or leave me with any filmy feeling
it is not a cleanser i feel like i can't live without or am head over heels in love with
this product really is just a basic mild cleanser
doesn't foam very much
it's hard to find a product that works
i didn't have rough skin to begin with
it does not remove eye makeup well
doesn't contain all the chemical nasties i try to avoid
doesn't feel at all tight
since cleansers aren't on your skin for long before you wash them off
since you shouldn't need to cleanse away any makeup
the hydration in this mask always gets rid of any flakes from my skin
i didn't find this mask to sting or irritate it otherwise
i cannot use this product every night because it tends to over-moisturize my skin
it didn't irritate my skin
everyone's skin is different
so there might be less of a tingle if you don't remove layers of dead skin immediately before using this
that sort of talk borders on pseudoscience.
it is gentle but it will give you results.
i love that it's fast, and easy to rinse off.
if you need a way to get a mask routine
could be too much for some who don't like the scent or who have reactions to perfume
i also liked the fact that it isn't at all drying or irritating
it's not drying at all.
this some how gave me a matte glow it's hard to explain
not in a greasy way
given that it's the winter time
i need something to pull out all the junk in my pores
i don't mind the price because it's hard to find products that work my skin
i do not get pilling
can't believe how quickly it absorbed
yet somehow manages to keep my face moisturized for the whole day
it's perfect for day use which is what it's made for anyways
typically use this after i shower or wash my face
t doesn't take long for my skin to suck this stuff up
it is the only moisturizer that actually absorbs into my skin
have struggled with moisturizers that are too thick or make me too greasy
it's a game changer from my usual moisturizers.
there is no sticky feeling after i put it on.
it's thick but absorbs well.
it's not too greasy
it's sort of sticky, but in a good way.
t allows your base to easily cling to your skin without attaching to any dry patches or anything
i don't think i would recommend has your nightly moisturizer or anything
i do tend to break out easily
doesn't break me out or irritate my oily sensitive acne prone skin
i do dish it wasn't in a jar
i then use a touch of nars blush
maybe because of my age i use my makeup very sparingly
since using this product it's all
didn't clog my pores
didn't "ball or clump up" like others are saying
i suggest you try it as a night cream if you don't like the feeling of it as a day moisturizer
must be people's make-up or dry skin if it does on others
it does meld into my skin or i wouldn't be able to apply silicone primer
it doesn't leave my skin sticky
it also doesn't burn like a lot of moisturizers do on my extra sensitive skin
if you're wearing make up i found that hourglass veil primer along with those two work products really give you a flawless skin complexion
i don't put it on before makeup cause if i did it kinda clumps up
doesn't work well under makeup
can usually use anything
i will say that it stays tacky
doesn't ball up on my skin
dewy3- skin brightes has increased 4- lips volume has increase yes i use them on the lips 5-it balances my combination skinover all i give it a 12 out of 10 the smell is not good
other have said it's too thick
if you do use it as a day cream
is that it's in a jar
didn't irritate or cause my skin to break out
this sinks right into the skin without making it feel greasy or oily
i struggle to find a moisturizer that doesn't make my skin oily or doesn't do the job
it doesn't contain perfumes
t doesn't irritate my skin
it's a relief as i rub it in.
i wouldn't say it's fast-absorbing because i can still feel a very slight tackiness after i apply it
i like that because i feel as though it's providing a longlasting layer of moisture
this doesn't have a nasty scent to this like some moisturizers out there do
try this one it's great especially for sensitive skin you won't break out i promise
i can see my tub lasting a long time.
it's not heavy at all
the mud/dirt/oil/i don't even want to know what that is that i contend with i searched
not heavy moisturizer that also didn't make my face breakout
still feel like a luxury experience not a thick goop
it isn't heavy whatsoever
my face doesn't feel tight all day
it doesn't have much of a smell
until my 30s has always been oily
dark spots weren't terrible
the redness just didn't disappear as quickly.
it's lightweight and doesn't just sit on my skin.
you should definitely try this product if you're looking to correct redness or acne scars
i do recommend it to any one with dark or red spot
totally worth it if you are ready to get serious about treating your sun spots
i love that it's easily absorbed
most importantly it doesn't clog my pores
this doesn't quite do the trick at cutting down on shine
i will not recommend to use more than two drops or maybe just use it at nights to avoid oily-looking-skin during the day
i don't know if i'd recommend this to someone who has trouble with an oily complexion
doesn't leave a residue or leave skin feeling oily or tacky in any way
don't make me look oily either
actually squeaky clean after i use it
it's still the same size of soap
acne-prone skin that tends to break out or get inflamed when i try new products
i can't recommend this cleanser enough!
not just cleaning the surface
i normally don't spend that much on a bar of soap
the brush head helps it lather even more that it does on its own
there's never any make up left on the cotton pad
it doesn't irritate my skin at all or leave it feeling tight
i love the smell because it is not overbearing.
it doesn't seem to clog pores
doesn't sting the eyes
it's hard to find products without all the chemicals
it's on the small side if you are used to cheap soap
they need to realize it's natural
i can't even describe the smell
nothing would get rid of the bumps
it doesn't sud too much
it's easy to get product
this bar has completely gotten rid of my breakouts
it doesn't overdry or feel sticky.
it's nothing that can't be fixed by a little bit of moisturizer
i am not into bar soap because most are not good for your skin
as it can be used on your body too
i've never found a bar soap that doesn't completely dry out my face
i love knowing that it's all natural
this is one of the only soaps i've found gentle enough for my face
you can't beat herbivore's natural ingredients
i hate all the cheap fragrancy body washes out there
don't mind that there isn't much scent to the soap
it's a normal sized bar soap 2.
what i love about this soap bar over others is the smell
it doesn't leave much foam/soap on the face to allow for good lubrication
great soap without any nasty or unknown ingredients
the soap wasn't so drying on my skin anymore
over time, the smell does fade a bit.
however i do like this soap since it helps with my breakouts
it does seem pricey for a soap, though.
doesn't leave your skin feeling dry or like its sticking on you
it's so hard to find luxury products that are clean
this oil somehow need us the oiliness of my t-zone
i wasn't able to use this oil for a long period of time since the smell makes me nauseous
this instantly reduced the size of very big annoying pimples even my prescription gel wasn't getting rid of
my t-zone is usually very oily
it's change my skin from being red
this oil does wonders for my skin.
if i had some sugary food or dairy i would break out the next day
yes there's a scent to it
this will not banish your redness alone
helps even out my complexion
it doesn't make my skin greasy / inflamed
it does not clog my pores
i don't have much acne just on my chin
my makeup is usually a hot mess before lunch
whatever the ingredients is inside this oil smells exactly like when you walk into a teavana store
there's less redness in my face
i can't get over the smell it's a dream
now i don't have acne
can't seem to shake them
only lasts for 5ish minutes before it completely disappears
i did notice that little bumps would pop up on parts of my face where i don't normally get acne
i don't have much acne
somehow they are disappearing
it's made out of natural ingredients -- plus it's cruelty-free
it does make your foundation slippery though.
when i wake up my face is pretty much matte instead of oily
they weren't pimples or a rash
then you'll see the balanced effect
i don't feel it clogs up my pores
there's no worrying about it looking greasy or anything
the scent does not linger
don't know how it stacks up
little did i know that evil adult acne exists
it's seriously a magical little miracle worker.
it's too heavy for day for me
when they say it's oil balancing
was really hesitant to try a facial oil
this stuff will last you a loooooong time
this oil is truly a game changer for those with oily skin
don't be hesitant about applying oil to your face
i do not become oily throughout the day
it's light enough that you can layer it under sunblock without feeling like an oil slick
i can't get enough of herbivore botanicals' products
picky skin which changes its mind about products on a dime
doesn't make me greasy at all
even though i've never liked the idea of putting oil on my oily skin
which often happens on my chin in particular
i don't mind the scent of this oil
i kept reapplying thinking i forgot certain areas of my face until i realized that my skin was practically inhaling this stuff
seeing as it's oil after all
this oil does not clog my pores
something i haven't been able to do with most oils since they tend to leave you shiny
i don't wear foundation or any kind of concealer on my face
make sure it is fully dry before you do so-you'll feel like a rich housewife when using this oil btw-dark spots are gone
the smell is the thing i like the least
soft i just can't get enough
doesn't irritate my skin or eyes due to fragrance
i don't feel a heaviness or greasiness that other oils can leave
bad habit i know
already noticing my concealer doesn't have fine lines to settle into under my eyes anymore
that it's not greasy
i actually use it under my makeup
creams are full of things you should never put on your skin
i can go without makeup
it's really helping get rid of my awful dry flakey winter skin
i feel like it's even softer
can't wait to try the lapis oil next!
i shy away from oils that aren't advertised for the oily among us
though i don't know if i can detect much change in appearance
even a hint of coconut oil breaks me out
it also doesn't cause breakouts nor is it greasy on my skin
it's still not heavy
smell is maybe the most personal of the senses
people seem to have mixed feelings on the smell
i love it when skin care products are so luxurious you can't wait to use them
you will want to wear less since your skin will look more youthful--if you are looking to simplify your skin care
i think you can't go wrong with oils containing jojoba
it's so relaxing that i use it on my hands also.
it's a completely luxurious way to take care of your skin
most days i don't feel the need to wear face makeup
i love that it's all natural skin care
something i dislike about many oils
the sent fads fast so don't worry if you are averse to fragrance
whatever the magic is
the packaging is so beautiful that i it can be left out in your bathroom
it's also not too heavy or oily.
it's light enough to apply in the morning under your make up
i couldn't stop smelling it
every night i have trouble deciding if i want to use this or blue tansy
if followed as directed this mask will turn your skin from blah to radiant in a matter of a few days
i can't wait to add more of herbivores products to my beauty routine
they'd often leave me with itchy
you can make them as thin or thick of a mask as you want
i do remember a slightly unpleasant feeling on the skin when i first used it
i do get the occasional spot
though he's not fond of the smell
well even though i don't have acne or oily skin
sometimes it just r
you really only need a thin layer.
yes it's a little messy
it's not a horrible smell
it's hard to clean off sometimes
i did get occasional pimples
i hardly have any blackheads
like i find myself touching my face all of the time because it's so soft
the spoon that comes with it is useless.
changes in my diet just didn't agree with me
it's kept the breakouts at bay so far
i didn't find that it burned or tingled either.
only weird part about it is that it's in a giant glass jar
the super cute packaging doesn't hurt, either.
it's a bit hard to apply
it does sting a bit
i don't know what kind of witchy magic is in this
would also not make my oily combination skin act up
takes of all the surface dead skin so your pores can actually breathe
it's not too harsh also!
scarring is gone and i simply love it.
buy this, it'll save your skin.
after that there's no more stinging
doesn't irritate my skin
i don't mind the smell.
it shouldn't drip off your face.
my skin texture is pretty much smooth besides the occasional small pimple--even my friends have noticed
just remember a little goes a long way cause it asks for a "thin" layer that stays on for 15-20 min
it does dry, you just don't need to use a lot.
maybe because it's a super thin consistency
it did not help with hyper pigmentation at all
oh cannot forget the forever clogged pores
it doesn't irritate me at all
especially if it's already irritated from washing off my makeup
pros:-your skin feels as soft as a baby's whenever you use this mask-a little goes a long way -does a great job of decongestant skin
yes, the smell has made me gag.
nothing i used could get rid of it.
it helps even out my skin tone.
it does tingle a little
my face tolerates it just fine
the mask did feel stinging
it's a bit hard to wash off after it dries out
i found that repeated usage doesn't irritate my skin at all
the only downside is how long it takes to rinse off
it's so easy to use and brings results!
this hydrates my skin so much i don't even put on moisturizer after
it doesn't linger on the skin
if you're like me you'll appreciate the smell
super lightweight so you won't break out!
the mask is basically a mini chemical peel
it never irritates my skin
causes break outs or anything
non-dull skin you have
i didn't experience any tingling
i usually am one that likes to mix it up
i love that you don't ever have to expose it to the air
prone to breakouts if my skin barrier is messed with
this does all of those plus i am left with an even complexion
cooling while it's on
i don't even have to use as much concealer as i used to
i can't say enough about how amazing the blue tansy mask is
it's a little tingling to start
lots of products don't work right with my skin
be sure to check that yours has the spatula
i don't love the scent---it's not unbearable
every time i have a bad skin day i use this
it's especially good to use around my time of the month when my skin is hormonally freaking out
not only does this work within 3-4 days to clear up any acne or small pimples you might have it even improves the over all physical texture of your skin
doesn't cause me to break out in irritated red bumps on my extra sensitive cheeks
the smell isn't too bad when you apply it on your face
sadly it doesn't stay on your face when applied haha
usually this irritates my skin
i didn't experience any burning or eye watering.
it didn't tighten or crack on my skin.
didn't cause any redness
not sure it minimize wrinkles or dark undereye
it's made a big difference
i don't ever feel like i'm tugging on the skin
not too sure about the anti-aging aspect of this cream
my concealer doesn't slip around
i usually neglect buying eye creams because they make my eyes sting so bad
when i apply at night i just don't dab it in as much
it doesn't have a scent which is nice
it doesn't cure crows feet
one of the only creams i don't react to.
yes it's a little pricey
i tend to get pretty puffy under eyes
it is not irritating
can't say how it wears under makeup
this doesn't make me breakout or itch at all
it's light on the skin.
there's good heft to this
there's no fragrance that i could tell.
i don't have wrinkles around my eyes yet
can't speak for their effectiveness in smoothing those out
it did seem to lighten my dark circles
that it didn't irritate my eyes or skin
that's enough product for both eyes
i wouldn't describe it as ridiculously thick
it doesn't give me milia
it doesn't irritate my eyes
the bulky packaging doesn't bother me so much.
doesn't burn my eyes
not just an eye cream
my makeup doesn't turn oily
not too greasy or think
it's definitely not hurting--i mean i don't look older from it--lol--it's very moisturizing--love that it's all natural
often have trouble using any creams around my eyes
i only wear this at night because it doesn't wear well under makeup
if you put it on your lids
it didn't fully get rid of my dark circles
becuase i like how lightweight it feels when it's on my skin
doesn't leave the skin feeling super tight like other products do
my eyes water at the slightest thing-even the clinique eye creams couldn't get too close to my lash line
not to mention my wrinkley lids
i can't wait to go a few weeks using the eye dew
the smell it's horrible
i don't feel greasy in the eye area
i strongly recommend this for someone who doesn't need a heavy cream
sometimes dont even have to put moisturizer on afterward
i don't really have puffy eyes
at first it didn't seem to sink into my skin
i can't wait to use their firming masks.
i've noticed that my skin doesn't look as fresh
it does have a licorice smell so that may be a turn-off for some people
whatever is in there packs a wallop
it's one of those products you put on
can't say i've noticed any smoothing of wrinkles
they have either done nothing or gave me contact dermatitis
it's non drying, and doesn't leave a film.
i usually have to use plain raw shea as everything else causes breakouts or flaking
there's nothing super special about it
this product does have a smell to it
after you put your other products on it doesn't smell as bad
if i don't dilute it
it's pricey, but lasts a long time.
one pump is enough to cover your face.
or else it will get tacky
doesn't mess with my makeup
it leaves my face feeling a little sticky feeling afterwards
i think it's very simple.
it's all due to this line
can sometimes burn the skin
if the color is dark or the product smells bad
you may have gotten a bad batch
doesn't really get a deep enough clean to remove makeup
it's a great addition to my skin care regime.
apply with moisturizer you can wear under your make up
yes, this product does have a weird scent.
oddly enough that bottle did not smell strange
i wish they could add a little more scent to the serum to cover up the strange wet-dog odor
otherwise it spills down the side
doesn't remain tacky like other serums can
i don't smell anything
this thing smells like a can of corn.
my skin looks even
you certainly can't smell it after applying moisturizer
especially if i sweat
so my skin isn't in bad shape
goes on kind of tacky
i can't speak to how well this product moisturizes on its own
out of desperation i would pop my breakouts
it does got on tacky
have never felt it's too thick
just make sure you watch out for oxidation
i find that i barely need moisturizer after this combination
i didn't find the smell irritating at all.
it doesn't seem like it has lightened any of my acne scars or dark spots
doesn't leave an oil residue
the smell is nothing bad it simply means there's no perfumes in it duh
everything seems to give me pimples
this product doesn't smell bad.
wrecks my skin like so many products i have tried
first of all let me just say that yes there is a smoky scent to this serum
that's because it's all-natural
if you wash your h
you won't smell it at all
i don't mean the my skin is so oily it could be glowing glow
i wore this under my mattifying moisturizer because i can see how it could make my skin oily if i didn't
a lot of people say it's tacky
which tends to stick with you on your face
that doesn't tend to bother me since i usually layer it under other products
it's important to note that this product has an orange color not because it's gone bad
this doesn't sting my skin
you don't even smell it once on face.
this can make you look shiny or make your skin feel sticky
nothing else i've used makes my skin as glowing
no the scent doesn't smell like a creamsicle like some other c serums
that's because they don't add artificial fragrance
does have a slightly tacky feeling when applied
did not leave any sticky texture
struggle to find the right moisturizer to use before i do my makeup
a primer before i do my makeup
it's not overpowering at all though
doesn't leave my skin shiny or greasy
it's so smooth when you put it on
i can't get over the smell of this moisturizer- it smells so good i just want to keep putting it on my face over
this one's a winner for me.
there's this nice cooling affect
i do not like sticking my fingers in a tub.
i used it as a primer and it wasn't half bad.
i love the way it makes my skin all glowy.
even out my skin
when you overuse it
try it out, you'll love it!
it's not heavy whatsoever.
it's even great to wear under makeup.
i usually don't wear primer since i don't like silicone
it doesn't moisturize as well as i hoped it would
it doesn't leave my skin oily.
this doesn't irritate it at all
doesn't leave any sort of residue behind
i compare it closely to boscia's sake gel except erborian's moisturizer doesn't give you any sort of tingling sensation
i struggle to find a cleanser that doesn't dry it out or irritate it
does not irritate my rosacea
i don't wear a lot of product on my face
don't like any of them i realized i should just buy more egg mousse soap
it doesn't irritate my skin at all!
people keep saying it doesn't remove makeup
this is k-beauty in which you're supposed to double cleanse
your makeup will melt right off
what's more important is that it washes off all my makeup
i find its the only cleanser that really cleans my face
a lot of reviews read that the product doesn't provide a deep enough clean
this makes me feel like mrs doubtfire when she dips her face in whipped cream
gives me a deep cleanse which was exactly what i wanted
t's hard to find a product that doesn't irritate my skin
i don't wear a lot of heavy makeup
which i always remove with micellar water anyway
they should omit the part about hydrating your skin since it doesn't really
the only bad thing is the smell.
because it doesn't removes makeup
something about the foam makes it feel extra effective haha
you won't feel any film or residue on your face
it's super non-drying
it doesn't remove eye makeup very well
my boyfriend is a low-maintenance person who doesn't like a lot of steps
who doesn't like a little k-beauty?
it is a little messy, but i love the scent!
you will freak out
it doesn't leave it tight or taunt after using
i feel like its a bit gimmicky with the foam
it doesn't get into your eyes
i wouldn't say it hydrates at all
it doesn't make your skin feel stripped
if you wear makeup
it doesn't make my skin feel tight
i massage it in some more until it totally rinses off
the only issue i have with it is that because you're supposed to apply this to your face before rinsing with water
it makes your skin to breath after using it
it's also fun to make foam beards
it doesn't make my skin red
reminded me of those foam soaps i used to use as a kid
this cleanser actually makes my skin look
washing your face at the end of the night can sometimes be a boring task
unlike other "sensitive" cleansers it doesn't irritate or redden my skin
it doesn't strip my skin at all yet leaves it feeling very clean
i always use a gumball amount rather than the egg amount that's recommended
it does not make your face "squeaky clean"
you still need makeup remover
a lot comes out when you dispense so be careful
it's a thick foam which is nice because i hate when foam washes just dissolve in your h
because of it the consistency it didn't provide enough lather
it's very light and doest have much of a scent.
it doesn't remove makeup
i can't wait to try other products from too cool for school
it is a bit strange at first because it does feel like you're putting shaving cream on your face
note: this cleanser is not made to take off makeup
it's not like any other facewash i've used.
it doesn't strip your skin
they say egg sized amount and it's way too much.
do you want to have a party while you're cleansing your face?
my skin tends to look dull
i just want to clarify that i use this after i cleanse my skin thoroughly
whenever i use it i always see my pimples/troubled spots shrink
if you suffer from rosacea you'll underst
it is easy to wash off.
one of my major pet peeves with face packs is how difficult they can be to rinse away
as i don't use it often
it's not sticky feeling like a foam
it's also the only mask i have found that makes a difference in 5 minutes
the bubbles kind of tickle as they pop
something that comes out as a thick foam couldn't possibly do good things for my skin
use it sort of like a face wash
i don't really see differences in masks beside the ones that leave my skin super soft
try it for yourself!
didn't look greasy, fell heavy, or break me out.
i don't find the scent overwhelming at all
it doesn't ball up my makeup either.
also doesn't clog my pores.
it's all the time
while it doesn't give me the instant eye lift like shiseido
i also love that this doesn't contain any fragrances
i literally don't have to use concealer anymore for dark circles
the first time i used this i didn't pat it in so my concealer creased really bad
not irritating to my eyes
an eye cream that actually works!
swear my dark circles weren't as bad as usual
it does not irritate my eyes
it's light enough for use under makeup
i don't have dark circles
they never burn or get milia
i remembered that the bottle says you can use this on the lips
most everything else didn't even touch the puffiness
i can't speak to puffiness or dark circles yet
i don't have to use another eye cream
does not feel sticky or tacky at all
doesn't leave any tackiness behind
does not leave a greasy feel
it's not greasy, yet seems to moisturize well.
it de-puffs pretty much instantly
if you've had filler you know the feeling.
no lightness or reducing of my dark spots what's so ever
no need to have my chemical peel done
if you massage it in for a couple of minutes it doesn't stay noticeably sticky
even if i don't touch a pimple it still leaves a brown spot
you have to moisturize like crazy though
it hasn't entirely gotten rid of them
i used it as a spot lightener too
i am worried that it will get rid of my freckles
even if i don't pop a pimple
feels tacky for a while after you rub it on your face
it works it's magic
and they're not so cute and freckly anymore.
the only con is that it seems to clog my pores a bit
i can't wait to see if it helps dark spots
if you are expecting your skin to do a 180 then turn your attention to laser treatments
this bottle lasts forever if you are simply spot treating acne scars or brown spots
otherwise your dark spots can get darker
tacky if you use to much
one of the only lightening serums that works on my horrid dark spots
the murad also seems to tone my skin somehow?
shouldn't use it all over the skin
yes it does have a bit of a strange scent
skin treatments shouldn't be judged on how pretty they smell
make sure you use sun screen though because it does make your skin sensitive
it's lightened them a ton
you just want to be sure to wear spf to keep your melasma at bay
it doesn't act fast
works pretty well if you can stick to a nightly routine
as long as you wash your h
the smell will not linger
you don't smell it once it's on your face.
it doesn't smell good
that does soak in
the scent doesn't linger
longer you will notice your dark spots fading
yes, it is slightly sticky.
some freckles do not show through
it's a tad tacky, but dries down well.
you don't want to overly dry out your skin.
even out your skin tone
now only if i would stop getting hormonal acne every month lol
i am 36 and have some ugly age spots.
i can't recommend anything more for dealing with the aftermath of zit city
the only thing is when i use it was a spot treatment i get that halo effect
it doesn't make my skin feel dry
the texture of the cleanser makes if feel like you are really cleaning your face
really do not want to dish out the money for prescriptions from the dermatologist
my stress acne is almost non existent anymore
do not irritate skin
i even think it's helped lighten some of the hyper pigmentation left behind from my skin picking habits
not to mention clears my pimples away!
you should never use a face wash that has beads or granules in it with one of those
even though this is not labeled an acne product
cannot wait to try more face washes
t doesn't irritate skin from chemicals
oils i couldn't get it right
it doesn't lather as much like most cleansers i'm used to
it does foam up slightly if you rub it
i think some fade away like literally 95% i can't barely see it
it doesn't irritate my skin either
i felt like it wasn't cleansing
gentle enough to use every day
that are gentle yet they really clean
pricier than what you'll find at the drugstore
i suppose it was just polishing away the bad layers
i don't find it harsh at all
the eyes are a part of your face so wouldn't it make sense for a cleanser to be safe with the eyes?
i would never rub hard or use with any kind of abrasive pad or even a clarisonic
somehow evens out my tone
my skin doesn't get irritated at all
it's nothing moisturizer can't fix
it's easy on the skin
you'll be hard pressed to not find a cleanser with sulfates in it
it's not abrasive and i use it daily.
my skin doesn't feel too tight after use
now my face looks it's age
i occasionally try other cleansers
this doesn't show results overnight.
it's helped with her breakouts
this works well as it doesn't irritate my skin
as a bonus it's also helped my acne
it does not make me feel like i am scrubbing the skin off of my face
i guess that's the anti aging stuff
it doesn't irritate my skin at all
it may be overkill
can never find a face wash that helps
my skin is not flaky at all
the aha/bha in it makes it possible to rid of those little bumps on your arms
it's gentle enough to use each day
gentle they don't bother my eyes at all
not irritating, so i can use it daily.
it's also mild enough that it doesn't irritate me at all
it doesn't have a strong odor like clarins
when you wash it off it foams up into a cleanser so really its a 2 in 1
avoid your eyes until you're done with your face so that your eye make-up doesn't get rubbed everywhere else on your skin
it does not irritate my skin
know it's safe to use around my eyes
it doesn't leave my face feeling greasy
doesn't burn your eyes
you don't have to scrub
i no longer need to use makeup wipes before cleansing as this stuff literally gets off every
not only does it completely wash off your makeup
you need this just for the scent.
doesn't sting my eyes or make them blurry.
doesn't leave a heavy film or residue
this doesn't exacerbate any of these conditions
only some of benefit's they're real
only burns or blurs my eyes when i really mash it into them
typically will wear what i like to call a full glam face lol
makeup wipes often irritate me
more often then not i just want to peal my lashes off
it's just an oil after all
that's when i will go in with my murad cleanser
that's not to say that you still shouldn't cleanse your face because you literally just used an or oil on it to remove makeup
it always takes my mascara right off
and it's not too oily for my skin.
it's something i can tolerate or wash off right away
this product does not irritate my skin
i don't even wear makeup everyday
sometimes all the makeup wouldn't even come off.
i can even do my eyelids
does not irritate my skin
needless to say that i need 2 wipes
be careful not to get it into your eyes
normally when you think "oily face" you don't think "add oil"
it didn't burn my eyes.
although i still followed up with the foam because i like to be sure there's no residue/oil left
oil that doesn't make my face go haywire
i feel that this oil removes all of my heavy makeup
does not irritate my eyes or my contacts
doesn't feel gross afterwards, love it!
t doesn't break out sensitive skin
i break out easily when there are too many wacky ingredients
it doesn't all come off my face unless i'm using the cotton
the fact that it doesn't irritate my eyes
doesn't strip my skin
no need to use a facecloth
i started using cleansing oil to remove my eye makeup because it's easier on my lashes
sometimes it even got into my eyes
i love this cleansing oil because once it's mixed with water
i don't use much makeup other than some concealer
this also doesn't irritate my eyes like other oils
it's not drying which i was hoping for.
doesn't drip off your face like some of the other thinner oils do
mascara without much of a struggle
doesn't leave any residue
doesn't cause break outs
nothing that your regular skin care regimen can't take care of
she suggested trying this out since it's no rinse
not so with this cleanser.
doesn't irritate at all for me.
any redness they want to get rid of
it actually becomes a nice lather
also this doesn't leave my skin tight
i've started having pretty bad hormonal acne since i turned 30
i don't break out often
what product can actually reverse oily skin
it doesn't completely remover heavy liner or mascara
when i tell you this cleanser
its god's tear drops because that's the only explanation for how amazing this stuff is
was having some issues with breakouts that i couldn't kick to the freaking curb
i still get a pimple now
i put up with it because it's effective
i am not one to sugar coat stuff
cant use anything specifically made for acne because it drys my skin out way more
when i do get a problem area it never surfaces to a real pimple
i still am obsessed with this cleanser
it doesn't irritate my skin at all
is that it does make your skin dry if you've been using it for a while
i hate when some cleansers make my skin feel like a desert afterwards
definitely would recommend to anyone who have oily
unless you don't wear a moisturizer of course which would be with every cleanser
it's made my skin feel new
my face does not have the texture
the moisturizer does not leave a greasy feel
if i don't wash with it every night
my skin was no longer flaky
i highly recommend to anyone with acne or just a face wash that makes the face feel clean
you will need a good moisturizer because it's pretty drying
it does give my skin a little tingling feeling when using it
however it's nothing that my moisturizer can't h
it does not cause my skin to peel or flake.
would definitely recommend to those with oily
you don't see instant results
it's somewhat acne prone when i used this on my face almost 90% of my acne went away
f you have normal or oily skin this should be fine for you
i do not feel my face getting oily throughout the day
i noticed that you really don't need a lot of product to clean your face with this- all you need is a little dot
not skin deep so as for clearing up my skin like any product i have tried it does not clear my skin
i still get the odd pimple
my makeup goes on flawless when i do wear it
as for it's affect on my acne
nothing a good moisturizer can't fix
it's a bit odd for me though
this product doesn't really strip my skin dry
i can take a makeup wipe
i don't really have bad acne i get make 1-2 breakouts occasionally
i just like the fact that it eliminates bacteria that can cause acne that's my main reason for usage
definitely a must have if your skin is prone to breakouts
it doesn't work quickly
doesn't clear up all my acne
doesn't have much of a smell.
my breakouts weren't as red anymore
my breakouts don't occur as often anymore
you'll be right as rain
it's not good for taking off makeup
it cleanses so well that it doesn't bother me for the extra step
it's good for my acne prone oily skin i guess
it did not plump wrinkles or smooth fine lines
my skin dries out very easily even though it is greasy
i don't have terrible acne
i do get some zits often
you can't rub this product in at all or it will peel on you face
i don't recommend using it under makeup because it tends to peel
make your makeup look rather terrible
other than that i think it's a great product to add to your anti aging weapons if you don't mind the hefty price
i noticed to that it pills unless you put it on when your other treatments have dried completely
they are superficial so as long as i use this they go away
don't expect your wrinkles to completely disappear
there is no problem with putting moisturizer
it doesn't smell pretty at first
occassionally it would still do that balling up thing under my makeup
it is not an instant fix like the "plumpers" on the market
you would think a balm wouldn't be good for oily skin
it didn't strip my skin of it's natural oils yet removed all the make up
it not only removes all makeup
does not irritate my skin
it's calms my skin
when you smell it in the jar
nurish like no other balm does
this does not irritate my skin
not only do i feel like a glamourpuss old fashioned movie star putting on a frickin' beauty balm on my face
seriously buy this is you have remotely dry skin
it is rare for a balm of any kind to anything on my combination skin without giving me blemishes
i love to use this at the end of the day even when i don't wear makeup just to smell that amazing scent
it does have little sugar crystal chunks in it which some might find weird for a balm or might not work well for super sensitive skin
gets all the gunk off of your face while not stripping it completely
when i use my other cleansers there is always a little bit of residue left when i go over my face with a cotton pad
it's a little treat for removing full face make up or heavy foundation whenever i need to feel like a princess lol
if you put it on your eyes your eyes will have an oily film on them which is a big drawback for me since i hate that feeling
i don't seem to get the foamy milky reaction other comments say
it's also gentle enough to use in the morning.
won't bother your eyes too much if you're looking to use this balm as your "one cleanser for all areas of the face
when you're done cleansing your face
it's not a bad kind of "oiled"--i'd say it's moisturized with whatever ingredients are in the balm
a lot of products can seem to irritate it
don't let the texture fool you
once you rinse it off your face will feel like
anyone who feels like they just need a little extra glow to their skin
my skin always gets some sort of allergic reaction to that br
this stuff even takes off my waterproof liquid eyeliner
it's gentle enough not to irritate my skin
i don't generally wear makeup everyday so this balm is perfect for most evenings
i definitely wouldn't use this to remove makeup.
the little blue texture doesn't hurt my skin at the same time feel like slightly exfoliating
i usually don't like that
it's a nice treat for yourself
because it doesn't overwhelm my sensitive skin due to only being wax beads
it doesn't take much to remove all your makeup
it was not like grinding makeup into my skin
you're probably not massaging firmly enough
it doesn't feel oily to me at all
the "grit" i see mentioned in other reviews isn't harsh on my skin
i am usually one who loves the "squeaky clean" feeing on my face
others mention the smell
sorta does smell like a donut
i do still need to use bioderma to remove my mascara {not waterproof either
although i really only wear mascara
it's light and not overwhelming.
my skin doesn't take to physical exfoliators very well
it's working like a charm
it doesn't irritate my breakouts
this cleaning blame is expensive yes
you can use this as a mask too.
you feel like you've had a facial just by washing your face
although i don't use it as a wash lol i have a smaller jar of this
made it so glowy
just a note: i don't wear super heavy makeup
i love it because acne washes really irritate my skin
it melts all of your makeup off
it does not burn or irritate your eyes at all.
as you rub it turns into a milk
the only downside is that i found it would irritate my eyes which isn't good when you want to use this to remove eye makeup
this cleanser definitely takes off your makeup however
really can't speak for how to removes heavy or waterproof eye makeup
i really like it as a makeup remover
it literally melts all my makeup
it's used like most balms are
love that it leaves a dewy finish that doesn't irritate my skin either
i can't use it on my eyes because it really irritates them
it legit melts my makeup off
because you literally need less than a pea size of this stuff to get the magic happening
i don't mind that there's a little make up left because i use a korean skin care routine
i don't need to use a cloth to remove this
it never leaves my skin irritated like most exfoliants
i would not recommend this product as a makeup remover because it does burn when you get it near your eyes
otherwise you'll have a residue
yes love a good cleansing balm
this balm doesn't have as greasy/thin consistency like other ones i have tried
it's a bit pricey in my opinion
it doesn't strip my skin
that the scent is a little odd-- neither is a deal breaker though
this balm doesn't do that
you have to use some cotton or a wipe to help it
this doesn't smell like much in the pot
oily skin girls please do not be afraid to try an oil
it really does clean your skin
it even took care of my mascara without having me look like a raccoon
my skin didn't sense any level of irritation
ok, so i've tried a ton of cleansers.
i like the fact that it doesn't have added perfumes
alone cleanser no problem
it takes all my makeup off so easily!
it's also a nice thick balm so when you massage it into your face
you don't need a moisturizer after unless you want to
give it a try if you're an older woman.
does not clog pores
i notice my eyes are not as puffy anymore
struggle with trying to not let my concealer crease
it doesn't irritate my eyes
i know it's expensive so use the product sparingly
needs just enough hydration to not leave me shiny
it's non greasy and makes my skin feel great.
this has not made me break out or shiny
this stuff burns my eyes if it gets anywhere near them
no because it burns my eyes maybe if they made it without the spf
i really like this moisturizer it doesn't leave a white residue
it does not clog my pores
i love that it has spf in it as well since it's hard to find it a good moisturizer that doesn't clog your pores
it's doesn't smell to strong which is a plus
wasn't greasy at all
didn't have an annoying fragrance
i feel like it blurs out my pores just like the porefessional does
it's non greasy, super light and sheer.
they're often triggered by scents
i do not feel like i am applying a heavy sunscreen to my face that just sits on the surface of my skin
i became a fan right away because it's gentle
i don't really wear heavy makeup
i don't think this can do much for waterproof eye makeup
it's a great cleansing butter.
do its thing before i sponge it off
the sponge does make a big difference.
mine didn't come with a sponge.
makes your skin look
i still use my rose cleanser too sometimes
it's not heavy either.
could be fine for other people's skin
and try the clinique balm it's cheaper.
doesn't leave a residue on my skin after i use the sponge it comes with
it smells kind of like cheap soap when it's ironically the opposite
the product does take off makeup
didn't do such a great job with my they're real mascara
it's the only skin routine item i've changed
it only takes a little dab in your h
sometimes i use the little loofah
if you use a toner after cleansing than the above doesn't matter
i do not use the sponge with it
that is not irritating or overpowering
i wear a lot of makeup
i like the sponge but i prefer with the foreo!
gel and doesn’t seem as tacky.
i hate having to apply the gel with my fingers it's a mess
easier to wipe or wash off if you want to
it did in fact remove all my makeup perfectly fine
the tub lasts so long
even looking afterwards which speaks volumes as i have yet to find an hg cleanser that does not irritate my rosacea
however it's too pricy.
i can't stomach the $110 price
it's not like those cleansing balms that can only be removed with a towel
your skin won't feel tight afterwards either.
i literately have all the erno laszlo masks
it's not messy on your pillow
i sometimes even mix a little dab with my makeup when applying
you need to be careful to not apply it around your eyes as it stings a bit
not overpowering in the least
yummy scent i can't get enough of
it doesn't necessarily make your pores look smaller or get rid of the bags under your eyes
it does make your skin look
it doesn't cake up or feel tight
what i love the most is it doesnt make your skin greasy at all
it's not too heavy and doesn't make my face oily.
i don't have to worry about setting the timer to remover the mask
i like that it doesn't feel greasy.
i hate going to sleep with an oily face
was unsure how it would stay on or not stain my bedding
i may even prefer it to the sheet mask
the skin around my eyes wasn't so dark
the product comes out like jello
this is great because it doesn't irritate my skin or feel heavy on my face or goopy as a lot of other moisturizers tend to feel
not greasy at the same time
it's like getting an expensive facial while you sleep
doesn’t cause a breakout because it is not heavy/oily
