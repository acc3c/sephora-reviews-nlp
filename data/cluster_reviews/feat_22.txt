literally have no idea why more people don't talk about this so hydrating makes your skin feel refreshed
i feel pretty again
i just am in love with the texture of my skin now
really helped with the mini acne i was having.
this one is pretty bomb
its really helped clear up my skin as well.
i feel like it looks
the whole line to anyone
love the whole firmarine line
i feel really clean after
i love that it came with instructions because i am a total newbie at this whole taking care of my skin thing
i also use on my body as well it's very refreshing
if lazlo was good enough for hepburn
this is obviously a luxury br
it felt nice on the skin
you definitely need this in your skin care.
i still love you sephora.
i'll be sad when i use them up cause this baby is pricey
this stuff is a life saver!!
normally i buy a nice face lotion from whole foods something i can know what is in there
this stuff made my skin feel comfortable until the next morning
i liken it to something like that
i've purchased this in the past when my skin was super mad at me from too much retinol
definitely some sticker shock
you definitely do with this product
would love to order, but nothing is that good.
i would definitely recommend
liked everything in it
i do feel like it has calmed my redness some too.
it is definitely a huge improvement than what i started out with
i feel like i need to put something that will soothe it for the night time
i love the say my skin feels
the rest of my face whether it be from a harsh mask i tried or really just because my face is naturally red
now i really really needed to try it
it did seem weird at first because of the tacky feeling
i finally felt like i didn't want to scratch my skin off
my skin honestly feels like a baby's
makes my skin feel great in the mornings if i wear it to sleep at night
i love the feel of my skin after i put this on
it does smell a bit weird
this is one of about 5 products of 45 i've tried that actually heals my skin
it also makes my skin feel so firm, love it.
i loved the way it makes my face feel.
you know it's good when 24 hours later you can still feel its effects
just made my makeup look really good
even my skin looked
24 hours after using this my skin still feels great
i really wanted to review it to share my experience
i always look for cream that really do the job
i tried so many things to have comfortable contacts
i would still find myself itching it
fab helped a bit but not like tatcha.
they always make my skin red
maybe she'd know a thing or two about catering towards my skin type
'm not just talkin' here
it's pretty crazy how well
this puts all of them to shame
the way this makes my skin look
i really like it
that gives u an idea on how nice the product is
honestly i have really sensitive skin
as someone who pretty recently found out they have psoriasis i have really started trying to keepy skin in better condition
i can definitely see a difference in the morning right when i wake up
the note inside that tells you everything about the product
it's really light i barely feel anything.
my skin feels so good!
i really like how dewy
they have always felt heavy
ugh i'm so mad that this is such a great product.
i've never had my hair look so great before!
so face oils are always of interest to me
actually makes me break out
this right here is your gem
put this on my dagger was amazed on how beautiful my skin looked she said i looked glowy
i really wanted to not love this oil
i really really do!
especially when i wear my foundation
i am now a true believer in the wonders that oils can do for your face
i love the way they feel.
just feels so amazing going onto your skin
as always it never disappoints
i always like to mix a couple drops into my foundation
it works wonders for me
this really helped with the texture
recommend it to anyone who has always struggled with texture problems under their eyes
love how it feels cooling around the eyes.
don't need anything very intense so this gives me the perfect boost to wake up feeling confident with my skin
my face feels so good
this made my day because i knew this stuff was correcting my skin
it also has really cute packaging
the peel is just so fun to do.
i noticed that it smelled so good
not a fan of sheet masks always have hard time to use them
it feels really good on your skin.
thought it would be cool to try
thought it was just a gimmick
i am not too sure if its really firming
just wanted it because it looked cool
i got it because of the fun chrome look
i did feel like my skin was firmer
makes my skin feel amazing
it is definitely fun to apply
i can really see the difference in my forehead where i forever have lines that never smooth out
it isn't for everyone but it really helped me.
most importantly love how amazing my skin felt
all the good things you hear about this mask are true
my skin feels so good after using this.
really like how this works
this mask really does work well
i makes my face feel better
did make my skin feel smoother
i love the way my skin feels after using this product
the only reason i got it was because of its cool color
which feels like a waste of product to me
i like doing this type of mask to prevent it
it's always a good idea to do those extra things to keep your skin looking young
i feel like my skin is still glowing
most people in the comments don't really like this product
totally agree it hurts coming off on the edges
super fun you look like a glowing tin man by the time it's ready to come off just make sure you apply a generous amount
really love this product.
after putting this on i’m pretty sure i literally said
even your boyfriend gives you a funny look?
which is super satisfying if we’re all being honest here
my skin actually felt really nice
feel it was a very good value
try it ~ it's fun.
this mask was so much fun to apply and wear lol!
the first time i used it i definitely felt the firming effect
i really do think my skin looks better
i read somewhere that this product is full of alcohol so your skin feels tight
it makes my skin feel amazing
did come off very easy
tight while also being fun to wear for pictures
really love effect of this mask
i really liked the way it felt on my face
which looks really cool
i couldn't stop looking at myself in the mirror
i think they are good products
where i really need firming
you might find this a nice mask to have on h
it worked really well!)
it smelled so good
i feel like this mask really does make a difference in the elasticity in my skin
i do not feel it helps with texture
i really like this mask!
i definitely know it works on fine lines
this product is so amazing definitely would buy again
was a bit worried as there is a bit of a tingle when i first put it on
once i tired it i loved how it made my skin feel
my skin looked so rejuvenated i couldn't believe it
love this although the price is kinda high
it really gives you a face lift
it definitely has worked for me.
my skin really has never looked and felt better.
this mask has made my skin feel amazing
this makes my skin feel so nice
they make me feel really uncomfortable
bought this serum which turns out to be my best "trying out new stuff" experience
this serum feels really good on my face.
i got this stuff for my skin
it dose make you feel really good when it touches your skin
this product actually being able to physically
i love how this feels on application
i know i'm doing something good to keep the skin around my eyes looking young
i really try to take care of it
so coming from someone that really takes care of their eye area i highly recommend this product
i actually have bumps that i am trying to get rid of
i recommend it to all hard working
i could tell i liked the texture
this stuff has done wonders
night i put this stuff on
now that i've started using this stuff
i really love this!
this made a difference for me
i feel that it really helped my skin along with my night serum from kiehls
it is hard for me to find good products
boy does my skin feel great
i know a lot of other people seem to love this.
my skin has never felt like this.
it is really healing
sinks into the skin really well
when you already have a good skin care it's difficult to see differences
i never realized just how much good it was doing to hydrate my skin
i've gotten a lot of compliments on my skin
one pump is enough to cover my whole face
it does make my skin feel great
it takes a little while to really get it worked into the skin for it to dry
even if i forget to follow it with moisturizer my skin still feels amazing
i feel like it's doing a great job of helping prevent excessive oil production
definitely a new staple piece in my skin care!
i hate things that feel like a blob of oil is on my face
it was just really really really bad dry skin
so sad because i really liked this one
i love it, too bad it broke me out !
am really loving the results
i always loved the cream
this stuff has done wonders
has really helped with my combination skin
it just really adds a lot of moisture that my skin really loves
liked it on my skin
i am definitely buying it
so i would still get really bad eczema breakouts.
nothing seemed to work for me.
i feel a big difference
i do feel this bar takes off makeup well
the way my skin felt after
i really enjoy using this product
can definitely testify that it works
this really helps with little wrinkles
it definitely helps tightening your skin
my skin feels so good
she continued to say that i have such great skin
i guess this stuff works.
about two weeks after using it once a day i really felt like it was helping my skin look healthier
just makes my skin look
when i went to buy it the guy helping me advised me the serum is much more effective
after using it for a couple weeks i can say it's really amped up my results in general
this really soaks in well
it actually makes my skin very clear
with no wrinkles really
you have to stare very hard
i personally love this stuff.
it truly is like a "corset for your face."
i wake up to super nice even skin tone
i love the feel of this one on my skin when i apply it
i feel like my skin looks younger already.
this one i don't feel like i have to
what are you doing?"
don’t want to feel like i am wearing a lot of product
i always thought eye cream was pointless
this product is so good that i had to buy one for my husb
i got a sample of this to try because i was sick of looking like a zombie
it was such a bad situation
definitely not good for my career
you don't have to put a whole lot because when you are rubbing it out it goes all over the eye area
i will definitely keep buying this product!
i genuinely feel that it gives my eyes more life
it was a bummer because i always felt like i had to put something on over the dark under eyes
i feel much more confident to go out into the world after using this stuff
it sinks in really well
i do feel like it does a bit of brightening
feels really good under my sleepy eyes in the morning
this was just okay for me
i really can see the difference in a matter of seconds just like it claims
i always notice a big difference
i do notice that it feels quite cooling upon application
which i personally love as i feel like my concealer really adheres to it
until i find it this product definitely helps
i am a big fan of this eye cream as it does wonders for tired eyes
i really like this eye cream
i can physically feel the skin around my eyes tightening after i apply
my one thing i hate about it is the packaging!
thats how good this product is
so my eyes are always very puffy
it also feels so nice
i think this eye cream is great for young people who are just starting to take more care of their skin
have some pretty bad dark circles
really does help me look more awake in the morning
that's good when i'm using before makeup
this eye cream is actually really good.
i think its a very affordable option for people who don't want to spend a lot of money for a good eye cream
as for the formula i think it's pretty good!
i fly a lot and this stuff really helps
i don't have really bad dark circles
i feel i have a good grasp on this product
even makes me feel more awake
it feels really nice
still love this stuff.
i've never really been a huge clinique fan.
it also makes me feel more awake in the morning which is an added bonus
this helps my long hard days at work look like they don't hit me as hard as they really do
it makes the skin around my eyes feel cared for
my mom actually gave this to me because i never moisturized before makeup
really bad i know
i adore the smell---it's incredibly comforting to me for some reason
it really does work!!!
finally i found a product that i can feel
see is really working under my eye
sad that now i'll have to keep on dishing out for it
this definitely helps to fight off the dark circles under my eyes
this product is really making a difference in my under-eye area
especially for us older ladies
i love how light it is
it feels so soothing when i'm getting ready
i think for someone with younger skin
i really enjoy this cream.
it's not very strong scent luckily
i think i am kinda used to it by now.
i like this product a lot.
i like it a lot
i wear very little makeup
it feels good not greasy going on the skin
i really liked how light the cream felt
i really enjoy the scent
i think the title of my review probably says it all
i really like it.
really like this cream
i love the way it goes on
then i discovered the power of a really good moisturizer
which is honestly pretty awesome feeling to someone who lived with bad skin for most of her life
it's definitely a winner for the summer time
it definitely has a scent
it definitely moisturizes really well!
the spf 30 is a great moisturizer if you know you're going to be outside
i really like this face cream.
i would definitely recommend it!
also needed other stuff
i really like it.
i got this for my man and he loves it!
it felt nice on my face
it has made my skin feel and look great.
i like it a lot.
i really like this.
i wouldn't be a very good friend if my skin was clear
you will notice the difference in the feel of your skin from day one
my skin feels very good
younger but i feel good.
i really like this moisturizer.
i still love the way it makes my face feel very soft
and i love how it feels.
especially with helping me with my lupus
really made a difference in evening my skin tone
it's nice and light, but it does the job!
areas a lot of us forget about
which works really well
i like the way my skin feels after i use it
i really love the light feel of this
love the way it makes my skin feel.
well, i was silly.
really seems to be doing everything it is marketed to do atleast for me
i feel it is just right.
really works on the fine lines
don't always sleep well so my eyes can look pretty tired
you will definitely feel a tingling sensation when first applied
they are definitely coming
great little treat if you were going out.
my under-eyes feel amazing
how they were really working well
said my eyes were looking great
this product really made a difference
this product tingles at first, but nothing crazy.
i really like this treatment.
you feel the tingle immediately
after the first use i feel it's been a positive experience
the pads stayed on pretty well
ive been feeling lately like i need a really good eye cream to help with fine lines around my eyes
i definitely feel a tingle that lasts for the allotted 10-15 minutes you're suppose to leave on
it actually worked really well
i feel like its just really hydrating too.
this did a pretty good job
i do think the eye pads are a bit big
it seems like you have to use a lot of product
this product really lasts
because i like to get on with my makeup
it works on me
i really enjoy using it
how wonderful to find a product that actually does what it promises
parties or any day you want a nice pick me up
wut i really liked about it was how my skin felt after using the product
i am really paranoid about the lines around my eye
i've waited 40 years for something to make my skin feel
i don't do mornings so that is quite an accolade
i especially wanted this because i don't like the way my chin looks
my makeup literally looks like i just put it on
this honest to god made my face feel as if there was no acne bumps
wish i can the full jar because it honestly boosted my confidence in my appearance
thought i'd have a quick look
it has done wonders for my skin
it really does fill out my face
it really wowed me how much my features changed
it was not like getting surgery
this product is great if you need a bit of a lift for your skin
i couldn't be sure it was happing at first because i was staring so hard
i felt like it
each day since then i have been amazed to how my skin looks so healthy
i swear this stuff is life changing.
you can feel it working
it gave a nice even tone
make it really smooth
i feel like this product really does help soften lines
i my complexion is definitely smoother when i use it
i feel like it's even healing some scarring i had going on
so needless to say, i still look fairly young.
i really liked how it made my face look & felt.
its not really something i can bring myself 2 splurge on right away
definitely give this a try
it's very new for me
i've just waken up & my face still feels great.
i think this product is what has given me this clear skin
i definitely saw a difference on my marionette lines
this stuff really works!!
which is a nice by the way if you're looking to get it in the 500 pt perk
it's given me a confidence i haven't felt in a long time
it worked so of corse i had to try this especially with all the great reviews
she gave me a weird look
she said no way!
i know everyone is different
i can feel what it does to my face.
think the key here is not to overdo it
you will definitely noticed results right away.
this actually works for me
i look like everyone my age now
try it, definitely try it.
i'll definitely keep using this product every night
this is the only product that i've tried that really fills them up
you really do see a different within minutes
have been getting really bad smile lines
my lines are gone my pores are gone my face have never look this good
it really does work to make the skin smoother
all i know is i literally could not believe just how incredible my skin looked
my skin still feels great when i wake up in the morning
i like the consistency
probably good for younger folks....
this stuff smells sooooooo good
my skin definitely looks
i really like it
it definitely leaves a film on my skin- which i don't mind
makes my skin look young
really what it does on the face is great
product really worked for me.
i love the feel of this night cream
let's just say i am in shock that for the first time my skin doesn't feel rough or tight
my mom has used lancome all my life so naturally they were my first choice
i get compliments every time i wear it.
no matter how great your foundation is
i really recommend this product for everyone
feel it will last me awhile
the entire line is really
really good for my skin
this needs to be known that you are definitely getting what you pay for
my skin has been going through some weird hormonal stuff lately
i can say it is a great moisturizer
it just feels good on my skin
really helped with the texture
i am going to shell out the money because i think this stuff is the bomb
am a fan for life-it works that well
it really truly minimizes my pores
this is also the first time i've ever truly had a "glow" to my skin that wasn't just the shine from oil
you definitely don't need to use very much
because it feels so good
the only thing i have tried in a very long time that actually works
it feels so good on my skin.
it was enough of a difference that someone else commented that i looked younger
yes i love it because it has a great smell
i also feel like i look a year or two younger
this right here is so goooooood
i can still feel the cream on me
there is definitely something different about it.
i will definitely keep using it
i really can see a difference
this stuff is honestly so good!!
then things got real
i think i'm going to have to buy this full size to see what a month or two can do because it's really gorgeous
the foaming thing is kind of weird.
this product actually has really helped improve the texture
but i added this in just to see and wow!
i love the dermalquench without retinol so thought to try this one for night time
with that said, i love this product.
first one that actually makes my skin look fabulous right after i apply it
now i do realize that my skin is very smooth
my neighbor ask me what i was doing different because my skin looked radiant
this is really the best thing that works for my dry skin
so that's always a plus
love, love, love, will definitely be repurchasing
it smells great and doesn't feel greasy at all.
it made me get into taking care of my skin because it was so fun to put on
this stuff is really amazing!
i breakout like crazy when i'm stressed
remembered how much i love it
i like how it felt during the mask application
it performs pretty well
it did do a really good job clearing up my skin
you get a lot of it
which i really love
i would definitely recommend it
i love that you can feel it working too
my face feel so clean without overdrying
my face actually feels clean after using this too
she loves it as well
really love this cleanser
overall i personally think that the price is okay for the amount you get
gets the job done
which for me is the only thing that helps them
this is definitely the high point of when i would get a cyst
never thought my skin could feel this nice.
this stuff has really helped my clear my face up
that i didn't feel comfortable being bare face
i love everything from how it feels to how gentle it is on my face
i really like this with my clarisonic.
it also smells so so so good!
i always find myself coming back to this one
definitely my go to cleanser.
i'll definitely have to purchase a tube of this stuff
works really for that
hearing good things from my derm
i've never truly noticed a huge difference with face wash
i honestly feel my skin has a bit of a glow
i absolutely feel more confident not wearing makeup some days too
i think people bought this thinking this was an exfoliator
the exfolikate used to really irritate my face
and you're actually getting a lot for your money.
really love this face cleanser.
it gets the job done
this feels so good
my skin always feels 1000x better after using it
it left my skin feeling and looking amazing.
made my skin feel
i know for sure it is this cleanser that beholds all the magic
does not make my face feel extremely dry afterwards
gets the job done
i love the feel of the product
okay, let's just start of saying wow!
i wanted to really care for my skin the best i could
i felt the need to for this one
i really like this stuff.
i really love this cleanser!
as we got to talking
my skin feels so nice
i feel like this is a nice alternative if you cannot afford the exfolikate product
it is never easy finding the right product to balance acneic/dehydrated
seriously tho, my skin has never felt so nice.
i am really enjoying this cleanser.
but this works really well.
this stuff helped me so much!
love how it makes my skin feel clean
it really works to clear acne
it really leaves my skin clear
i loved this cleanser so much
she too is purchasing this amazing wash
it might just help you feel comfortable going without foundation more
i really recommend it!
he told me that this stuff was amazing.
as soon as i felt the texture i realized that this was not an exfoliator
you don't need a lot of product to get the job done
something funny about me
i guess i am picky, but this stuff is amazing.
so this particular wash worked for me very well
my skin honestly still looked dirty
this leaves me really feeling clean
i loved everything about this
it is a little bit dry however my skin feels very nice right after i use it
i will definitely be trying more kate somerville products
oooooooooo i wanted to love this one so bad.
i really was running as fast as i could after using it to my moisturizer
i really like this face cleanser!
the ingredients make my skin feel great after using it
i like how much it lathers because it really encourages you to clean your face more
makes me feel like it gets it cleaner
my skin always feels so nice
this cleanser definitely lives up to its promises
my skin has never been so clear or felt so clean.
my skin has never looked so good
it foams up really well
i just feel that this one doesn't work as well for my skin
it really has worked for my problem areas
i could tell from the first use my skin felt completely different
this product makes my face feel amazing
definitely taking this baby on my travels.
this definitely did the job!
im really happy to find a cleanser that wow me like this one
they just kind of move it around a lot
this cleanser really does a good job of breaking down makeup
i really do enjoy this cleanser a lot it has helped clear
this product gets everything out
i definitely see difference in my skin
it was like i could feel the smoke
i feel like it gets all the dirt
my skin feels happier!
the results are so amazing that i can look past that
the results are so amazing that this is not a big deal to me whatsoever
i felt that there was a problem with my roller in particular
i am 36 and do have laugh lines around my eyes.
this stuff really works
i don't really have many to start with
this night cream is really great so far
my skin hasnt looked this good since my 20s.
was told have nice skin
which means you get a good amount of product for $40
i can already feel difference on my skin texture
my skin has never looked as amazing as it does with this moisturizer
which is just another thing i love about it
this face butter when i tried it is so nice.
this product has always suited me well
feels so good on the skin
i love the way it makes my skin feel
ever since then i have fallen in love with this particular product it works beautifully it's very hydrating it worked in the first application as the review says
definitely recommend this product
i never saw a real change in my skin's look or feel
i really like the way this feels on my face howeve it balls up when i use other products on top of it
if that makes sense.
because i just felt like it would work
actually my skin was just trying to makeup for the moisture i never gave it
it feels really nice on the face
definitely thinking of making the jump.
i actually got it for the oils
this product feels sooooo good on my skin after using it for a couple days i already love it
i love the texture and feel of this.
to me it has no scent which i appreciate
i think i have found it
it truly has helped my skin look
i really like it
since using it my skin feels so freaking smooth!
it's important to remember that it will take a few minutes for it to really absorb into your skin
sometimes i really wonder what some people are talking about when reviewing
really don't need a new cream
this is so good i'm seriously considering buying it
its just so good!
i could still feel the hydration when i wake up
this has done wonders for my skin
this is it for me
i really enjoy this product -- i am about to buy my second pot
see how it works
as i really need a new moisturizer
my skin does not feel tight after putting it on.
does not leave my skin looking really shiny
definitely a staple for me!
just amazing...you gotta try this stuff.
i really do love it
would definitely recommend this product!
my skin has never looked or felt better:
i knew i needed to find something
i feel like my makeup looks better too.
other than that, i love this stuff.
thought it sounded like it had real potential ads amazing
feels so nice going on
if i really want to get some serious hydration
i love this stuff so much
it gets really comfortable for me when it dries down
feel the difference using this cream at night
the price point is really nice for the amount of product you get
i kind of surprise how big it is
this one definitely tops them all
it is definitely a new favourite!
definitely a keeper in my skin care routine
it smells sooo good, too.
you can really feel it pull all that gunk out
this smells so good you could eat it.
i actually look forward to using it.
let me just tell you something about this mask really quick
everything looks soooo much nicer
i really liked it
it really does give you the most amazing glow
on days that i feel like my skin just needs something
it really does leave my skin glowing
thought i'd give this mask a try
you can instantly feel it working
this one sure deserves it
i really did like most of the masks
she said my complexion looked very even
it makes my skin feel soooo smooth
this really works to control my acne
my skin feels young again.
my skin definitely misses it when i don't use it.
i will definitely keep using it.
it felt really weird going on
the only downside is i feel i had to use a lot of product
this really exfoliates i love this so much
my skin looks so flawless after use that i get so many compliments with no make up on
i really love it!
this mask definitely does it's job.
i think this does a good job cleansing
it gets the job done
i over look it because it really works wonders
gets the job done
whenever i feel like my face has to much texture
i could feel them when i touched my nose
i really like the warming feeling.
you can feel it working as you wash it off
'm really picky when it comes to masks
so many things right about this product.
my face looked good
before getting this product i was very spectacle because of the price
big mistake on my part
it really gets off the dead gross skin which is a major plus for me as i have always struggled with this issue
i do think myskin overall looks brightner
i simply had to say how wonderful this mask is
this make really brightens
i would definitely recommend!
it feels like you have a new face everytime
i got this stuff with my points
this product is a game changer for sure!
i've never seen my skin look like this, ever!
not to the point where it is hard to work with
it made my skin feel so smooth i'm thinking i might have to buy the full size
even still this leaves my face feeling amazing
my boyfriend instantly asked me what i had just done
i will definitely be buying this mask.
my skin felt so smooth and looked great.
my skin feels like
sephora's samples have helped me discover quite a few ole henriksen products
it got very nice ingredients which don't irritate your skin
makes me feel like i'm pampering myself every time i use it
it feels so good on my skin
this stuff is amazine on my skin.
while feeling just like honey
this container can last you for quite some time since you don't have to use a whole lot
this is actuallymy first ever review on sephora so you can tell how awesome this stuff really is
even when i feel like i got all of my makeup off
this leaves me feeling
i really love it.
i really like it
cleans all the makeup off my skin which i found my last cleanser wasn't doing a very good job of
this makes my face feel really good when i use it
i've decided just to add this stuff to my skin care regimen
but it washes really well.
love the way my skin feels
it makes my skin feel so nice
i could feel the difference in my skin in two days
you really feel your skin clean.
it makes my skin feel better
skins feels good when done
done like the bottle
i really like it.
it really works well.

i already feel moisture coming back to my skin
just like all of milk's products

it does feel greasy going on
by morning that feeling was always gone
i feel that there are other

honestly it's all good
this stuff sinks right in.

it was definitely greasy
i say "heck yeah
i am not sure how this would work on oilier skin
they were both really nice
it's very fun to use
i really love the feel of my skin with this
-1 star because i think advertising it as something that can go over makeup is quite misleading
i really like it
it comes with me everywhere
i put it on whenever i feel like it
it makes me feel
i don't really like the smell
some people are saying it smells good
my inner product junky just says that it's something fun to have
makes me look younger!
they never really have been
those always look a mess on me
i really like this product
while it goes on pretty slick
i really hope this works well long-term
this product really does it for me
it actually looks fine
i also don't have puffy eyes to really comment if that worked
at the same time makes your skin feel cool
really cools me off
this really helps my under-eyes in the morning.
i always end up rolling this all over my face just because it feels so good
t is really easy to work with
it makes a big difference under my eyes
if you don't mind spending the money i think it's a fun product to have
i feel like it's going to last a while
it feels sooooo good on my skin.
it does make you feel better when the weather is really hot
i definitely recommend this to anyone looking to get rid of puffy eyes
it is so light that i love it.
i really like it
it is perfect when i am feeling really hot in summer or just want something refreshing
i love how smooth this was going on
i actually think it worked great as a primer under the foundation too
i think it's great for both now
it feels really nice on the skin
i really wanted to try this out
it definitely is cooling!!
that can get everywhere
wasn't sure if it would look good under my makeup
have really fallen in love with it
it feels so nice on my skin
it feels so refreshing
i love it for summer time especially on my neck area
i find it really easy to apply over makeup
i love how this makes my skin feel
it really does have that cooling sensation
i still felt like i could smell it for a while after
i love the way it feels on my skin
i honestly just bought this because it felt so cool
i think that it is a fun product
the way it feels is soooo refreshing
it feels so nice on your face and refreshes you!
it's also just a nice way to wake me up.
i really love the cooling effect on this product.
my eyes still feel tired
i would highly recommend throwing this little guy in the fridge
it definitely does the job of making my eyes feel refreshed
sooo good, just buy it already!
i definitely see a difference in her skin as well
on my whole face
he instantly loved it too
i really love this product.
first time i used it i thought it was alright
it even works really well on your lips
it makes up for it by feeling refreshing as heck
i imagine it'd also be really useful for women who experience hot flashes
it's just really refreshing.
the only thing that bothers me is the smell of this product
it really helps my under-eye area
i can definitely see an improvement.
what i noticed was after applying this my face felt tacky
i would definitely recommend it
also really appreciate it having the spf.
i've tried a lot of things from kheils to origins
i've tried other things here
this is the only thing that keeps my skin clear
i think it allows people like me to get an honest idea what a product is like before i buy it
i could see it perfectly in the summers
it is really good for night time
i already see an insane difference in my skin
it's seriously some good stuff.
i really like this moisturizer in the summer months
i always keep this in my routine.
pretty sure i'm on bottle 6 or 7.
my skin has never looked so great
i feel bad returning it
i got really bad chest acne that are so bad
i tried lots of stuff
overall i really like the product
something bad was happening to my skin
i've never felt this good about my skin in a long time
what it does have going for it is that it works really well
or very little-i love make up :
don't know that this lotion is helping anything really
i still love it
i really love this moisturizer.
i really love the texture
makes my skin feel really smooth
i decided to try this moisturizer because of the very good reviews
i feel like it does it's job
this has really taken such good care of my skin
had to do something to keep my skin clear
i love that it does not have a weird smell
i think this little tube of goodness gets the job done
hard to find another moisturizer that feels
thank you murad for keeping me in the clear!
wanted something that would help improve my skin tone
i already feel like it's working
it definitely has a smell
i tired a lot of products that are "suppose" to help control oil
none of them really worked cause i get oily in like 3 hours or so
it really does help control oil
it is what it is right?
it's very pretty for me
it really controls the oil as the day goes on
this really helped alot
i still keep a bottle of this stuff around if my skin ever feels not quite right
hope it works for me
although i've yet to find a moisturizer that really does a good job of that under makeup
i really like it
if you're just looking to add a little more moisture/ dewiness after you wash your face i think it works great
this stuff works really well with mud masks.
i feel like the mask goes on a lot better
it did feel nice on my skin
this is a really nice step for me.
it is a great idea for people who mask often
my skin needs a lot of help these days to look it's best
as a skin care fanatic i always look over products like this because i feel like if the mask is good enough it shouldn't need anything like this
it actually creates a really nice base for any face mask
...there is a primer for everything.
i really enjoy this produtct.
this one just seemed like
i can definitely tell that my masks go on smoother
they feel like they work better
this is a really great product if you have a mask that you dont want to use up too fast
definitely worth it especially if we both will be using it
i like the idea
i really like the texture
maybe but its still a nice mist.
i actually really, really like it.
nice things that make skin feel better
really origins, another primer?
but this stuff is really amazing.
i really like this product :)
i really did feel like my masks stuck to my skin more
it helps it all get in
i wasn't really sure what to think when i first saw this
after using it with a mud mask i really love it
i always use this mask
i definitely recommend this product.
i must say my face feels so good after using
really nice on acne prone skin
my skin feels really good after i've used it
ok so i really like this cleanser.
with this it doesn't happen my skin feels great
this is a great cleanser i use it every night i'm not sure if it takes makeup off
i go through it pretty fast though
now my skin feels great when i use it
not everything works for everyone
hopefully it will work as well for you as it does me
it really gets all of my makeup off
this has really helped clear up my face
really feels like it is cleaning your skin
was it really going to work for me
seriously the only thing that helps my skin.
my skin has always been kind of tricky when it came to cleansers because i never used them due to the fact that no cleanser was ever good enough
my acne cleared up very good too
all of those broke me out really bad in one form of another
it was hard to find
which i really liked for a while
the smell is really light
it does make my face feel a little tight.
the only odd thing i find about this product is it makes my skin feel dry afterwards
definitely recommend this product!
i am a huge fan of tarte's skin care lately.
this stuff has changed my life!
this product gets all my mascara off with very little effort
so,far this whole collection is really nice.
this product made my face feel amazing.
it helped make my skin feel nice
it's got so many positive things about it
here's the thing about this cleanser: it works differently for everyone's skin
how it makes my skin feel
i would definitely give it a try
honestly it changed my life
gets the job done
honestly picked this up because i thought the packaging was beautiful
the first few times i used this cleanser i didn't really get excited over the look
feel of my skin because i thought i was just having a few "good skin days"
my skin has never looked so good
it also takes makeup off really well
pretty normal everywhere else
i tried every product to help give me clear skin
this stuff works so well
it really takes all of your make up off!!
my skin has never felt or looked better
this stuff is life changing.
my skin has honestly never looked better
my only complaint is that it goes pretty fast!

this stuff makes my skin feel so good.
this has really helped in getting all make up off
this works so well on my skin
after a few times i decided i really liked it

feel a difference in my skin
after three weeks can say i really like how my skin feels
love everything about it!
honestly the moisturizer itself is pretty good.
you will love think
the first thing i noticed about this product is how lightweight it is
i really like the texture
the feel of it on my skin
i just started using this stuff this week
just something to keep in mind.
i love how they work together.
i love how i can feel it working within a couple uses
my skin right now feels smooth
it would be nice if there was more product in it however i will repurchase just because it's awesome
leaving your skin feeling just like the name says
it breaks me out here
the smell is really nice too.
this cream really does the trick
after it started to work really well
this definitely deserves one
i love how it feels
i also feel that this has actually helped clear up some of my breakouts
i definitely recommend this product!
i feel this product has help clear my skin
you don't always have time to do makeup when your step out
it kind of reminded me of champagne
i feel like showing off my progress
you really will see a difference
make sure you use an essence so that your skin will really absorb the product
i've always had oily skin throughout my whole life
oils really scared me
my skin has been doing some super weird things as i am getting older
it was definitely a hit
my skin loves this stuff
it makes my skin feel
never really cared to try it
my skin definitely looks more flawless
this has helped my skin to look and feel amazing.
i love how my skin looks
this leaves me looking great when i wake up
my skin is pretty
i don't know what kind of magic korres puts in here
after seeing what it does to my skin
this makes my skin look so amazing i haven't needed to put on makeup
thought that an oil was not going to work for me
so awesome to see an oil not break my face out further
i still use belif moisturizer here
now i kinda mix it in with my night time moisturizer
the good thing is that it also makes my skin stay hydrated long after i put this on
this has done wonders for my skin.
this stuff is a miracle
i love how it makes my face so so so soft.
i also like to mix a few drops with foundation for a really dewy
it is like someone gave me younger
it really made a difference
i really needed to do something!
comfortable the whole day
i really love it!
i truly believe it has done wonders for my complexion
definitely gives you brighter skin
i never look or feel greasy even though i have combination skin
it gave my skin a better look n feel in the am's
not only is the jar pretty
it does help create a nice base before i put my makeup on
this product keeps my face looking
i even went without makeup my skin looked so good
the scent is not really the same
my skin just looks
makes me feel legit
i feel like since i have added this oil to my routine its helped to minimize what i was using
this makes my skin feel
this oil has truly changed how i feel about myself
'm probably just being ridiculous here
that fact just makes me happy lol
complexion-correcting that i am just a tad excited every single time i use it
what's crazier to me is people assume i naturally have great skin
i liked how it felt when she used one
stupid me thought this smelled amazing
helps me alot on my under eye area
this oil really brightens my face
not only does it help to make my face feel really soft
i feel like if it's really working i don't care what it smells like
i tried a lot of facial oils and was never happy.
kind of like i'm trying to fill it in
wow i couldn't believe the difference this stuff made in my maturing under eye area
you really have to pat it on
it is pretty close to impossible for me to find a moisturizer that doesn't break me out
feels really moisturising on my skin
i got this as a point perk for me
this moisturizer has really turned my skin around
other than the scent issue this is a pretty great product
i love the way my skin looks
i really recommend it!!
seemed to work for my skin
my skin just loves it so much
my skin has never looked this good before.
i definitely recommend this for all skin types
it works wonders for me
i always find that it brightens my face as well
my skin has never looked so clear!
i also like how it always smell fresh
i actually really enjoy this moisturizer.
i don't know if it will work as well for me in the winter because i do get really dry in the winter
smells great and my skin has never felt better.
it's a cooling gel that feels so wonderful before applying makeup or even when not planning on wearing anything at all
no lotion ever seemed to work for me
i don't even have the words to describe how awesome this moisturizer is
i feel like this makes my makeup wear longer
have a really hard time finding anything that works
i like how my skin felt in the morning
this stuff feels so good when it goes on the skin
the way it looks
truly changed my life, as cliche as it sounds.
i feel absolutely no need/want to try out any new ones
i've always had a hard time with moisturizers
this product has really helped out
wasn't really into it
it's actually so good as a primer?
i think it's really great
when i put this on it feels amazing
has really helped clear up my complexion
i love the way it makes my skin feel
feels like it goes to fast
this smells really good too
ask anyone who has tried this the smell is hella good
this stuff is simply amazing!!
it feels so light
it works well for me
that is why i think it would be a great product to wear if you have oily skin
does not feel like you have something on your face
this i find you can use very little
but this stuff works!
definitely recommend this to everyone.
honestly nothing helps my face when i have rough patches or after i wash it like this
love the way it makes my skin look
at first i thought it felt a little tacky
it really feels good
would definitely recommend for all skin types.
absorbs pretty quickly for me
'm really not big on reviews
i loved this stuff so much i had to write one okay so for awhile i was struggling with all sorts of skin issues
it worked amazingly like honestly i was struggling so much
my face looks so much better like tarte totally saved me on this one because it was bad
i really do enjoy this product because of the smell
it works really well with my primer
naturally i was really nervous to try this out
not great for those who need a lot on the hydration scale
my makeup goes on soooo smoothly after using this
i feel like i could collect the ingredients myself
they really put a lot of product
i noticed my skin starting to feel really really dry
oh my gosh my skin has never felt so smooth
this h20 hydrating boost amazes me just like how i remember clinique amazed me when i was 18
yes i know it is pretty pricey for lotion.
pretty much know when i need moisturizer
my doctor recommended i use cetaphil which was really greasy
nothing seemed to be working
it really do work.
i feel i don't have as many people say i look tired
guess that's a good thing
my eye area doesn't feel fatigued which is great.
it's definitely a fun tool for just massages as well
this is a definitely must have =]
really sticks to the makeup
my skin is so clear now!!
hope this helps someone
my skin got as bad as it's ever been
make sure to wrap the product really well
you definitely get more bang for your buck with this product
fresh products are definitely my favourite ❤
it really does work
this is pricey for sure.
shifting to a new cleanser always makes me nervous
'm in that weird breakout/aging stage
i really like this cleansing oil.
the only thing i dislike about the fresh one is that the smell is very strong
i truly enjoy the two in sync
i really do like the scent
it really does do a nice job
i feel like the product will last
it has done wonders for my skin
i like to use about 3-5 pumps for my whole face
it made my skin feel amazing
really 2 pumps is all you need
i would definitely recommend for anyone with combination skin
i love the way it feels on my skin!
hasn't broken me out, seems really gentle.
secondly if you really want
you want a good product you can have
i don't feel like i need to with this one
it makes me break out a lot
have really liked it
and my face felt so amazing after using this.
the great part is you only need a little bit to cover the whole face
i really liked it
i love the way my skin feels in the morning
i really enjoy using this cream
definitely will recommend my mom
it applies really well
it wears really well under makeup!
i definitely notice the difference in my skin
it sure does a good job
it really isnt noticeable which i like because i dont like strong scents
i love the feel of this face cream!
the first thing i always do is smell it
it feels good right after i put it on
i really like that.
really think it's good
i find myself touching my face because of the difference in softness
it absorbs really well
i really liked this cream
the way my skin feels from using it
feels like nothing on
we are definitely not talking about hit or miss with your investments
was so psyched to try it since i heard such good things
i makes me feel.
pretty sure that's not possible
i can definitely see
my face just looks happier!
i think the results are very good
i've really enjoyed trying this out.
i really feel like my skin looks better
i even feel comfortable without makeup on
it makes my make-up go on nice
power essence really was
i am very careful of what i use on my face as changing my routine can cause havoc on my face
i even found myself going out without makeup a lot now
i really like how my skin looks.
i love how it sinks right in
it has made my face feel amazing after just a couple of uses
everywhere else was fine
this product is definitely a splurge
it was definitely firmer
it made my face feel greasy
i find myself having more "good skin days"
this really did work for me.
i think they work well together
i also really like the feel of the product
i loved them so much i just purchased them.
i get questions on what i did to my face "that day" ever time i use these because my face looks bright
these gel patches feel great when i'm wearing them
i really like these.
they do feel great on
i find this product definitely helps me with that
you just kind of stop thinking about it
my eyes looked pretty tired
the associate told me it would take a couple of months to really notice a difference with the gel eye patches
this was definitely a splurge for me
wish there was a whole face version
the only reason i left out one star is honestly i feel like the sephora eye patches does the same job
this is the best thing i have found to brighten my tired eyes
this is 'the one' for me
i feel like this product isn't necessarily making me look younger
i really recommend for anyone who has darkness
gave me the look of a good night's sleep
this product does not make me break out or give me any uncomfortable feel
the feel that put on my eyes is very comfortable
that makes me felt not secure
just feel amazing this morning
obviously improved my winkles under right eye.
i really enjoy this one.
it feels so nice under your eyes
i love the feel
because they felt so nice
they really do make a difference under the eyes
to really see a difference i would need to use them every day so $75 a month is a bit much for me
these are pretty darn amazing.
they feel amazing too.
anyways i've tried a lot of eye treatments
i hope this review was helpful because honestly this stuff is my holy grail
never thought to use an eye cream
i really love the consistency of this cream
it feels so nice under my eye
i definitely see an improvement
really nice eye cream for younger people
i really like this product.
i don't feel a burning sensation around my eyes like i have felt with other products
i would say this is the perfect first eye cream for us millennials
my eyes felt so smooth
whenever i put this stuff under my eyes it makes me feel way better
i really like this product.
i love how this gel feels around my eyes.
realize nothing is really going to make my wrinkles disappear
i've found some good ones
it feels nice going on
so this is a nice eye cream for times that my undereye area looks
i can say i definitely notice a great difference in the skin around my eyes
it certainly is for me
i got this by mistake so i said what the heck.
this is just a nice gel formula that stays in place
honestly so happy with this product it's so worth it
feels so good going on
i am really loving this eye gel so far.
definitely see such an improvement with my skin
my skin has never looked/felt better
anyways once i removed the mask my face felt so good
not only does my skin look great after the first use
i feel like everyone needs it
the lady working recommended this for me when i asked for a good mask for tired
really helping my skin look better on every aspect
my skin still looked amazing
every time i use it i see difference in my skin.
this is from someone who has had problem skin my whole life- acne
this is a great mask for when my skin needs a little pick-me-up
it really does leave me looking well-rested
wasn't sure that i liked the gel consistency since i would have to actually set a timer to tell when i had to wash it off
wouldn't be able to feel my tight face
i've never enjoyed a mask quite like i enjoy this one
my advice is to try it and see for yourself.
my skin feels sooo good.
only the things i feel i have to talk about or share
i actually really like the texture of it
i love how you can feel your pores open up
it really does make skin look brighter
you get a lot of product
just like it says!!!
won't to feel like i made an effort
i tend to see great results
it gave my face the perfect amount of moisture that it's been really needing
it really calmed my face
it's a nice mask to use a couple time a week for added hydration
i love the feel of the mask on
feels like i have nothing on
my pores around my nose didn't seem so dark which makes me extremely happy
i really love this oil.
i definitely recommend it
everybody's been really complementing my skin lately
it has been really looking flawless
as before i wouldn't even feel comfortable leaving the house without foundation
my skin has never felt so fresh i'm in love with this product
people keep asking me what foundation i'm wearing
i feel like my dark spots from acne are already almost gone
i really like this product.
it was very big
i really like the product
does definitely brighten over time
this is pretty legit
it definitely is spendy
scent not too strong, just right.
it is so good as getting all of my makeup off
this stuff is seriously amazing.
not making my skin feel stripped
i really feel like this refreshes my skin.
i really liked this gel like moisturizer
is starting to really smooth out
i love how light it is
think it helps some
it has a good smell to it too.
'm not sure how my skin will h
i really like it
i am not a huge mask person
i like it a lot
it's pink so the color is honestly probably my favorite thing about it :
once i washed my face my skin looked really nice
it hydrates really well i use it every morning
got this as a point perk and so glad i did!
highly recommend using your points to give this little dude a try
at the same time in all realness a product can do everything i want it to
my skin looks soooo nice i don't even feel the need to wear foundation anymore
this product genuinely worked miracles for me
i don't tend to put a lot on because it has a wet feel
i don't really want it getting all over my pillow during the night
it felt so good
this cream worked pretty well on my skin
i think it would not be so nice to skin
i wasn't really into it
makes my skin feel amazing
it feels so good on my face and on my hands!
it also makes me
which i'm really into right now
i felt the need to
am not sure how good it would be at that
this bar smells really nice tho.
definitely keeping this one around.
all in all its pretty good though.
i keep this with me to tell everyone about
i would definitely recommend to everyone.
it is great for those days when you don't feel like wearing makeup
i don't always use the bronze stuff in the cap
'm not sure how well it blends
i really love this product.
it definitely makes my skin feel smooth
i find this to be very pretty under foundation.
my sister is pretty fair
i realized that all things hydration works wonders for me
i really love this product so much for its hydrating results
i would definitely recommend this product for anyone who wants to achieve a natural glow
only bust this guy out on days when i really need the help
was nice for me to wear alone
really liked the ease of having a built-in highlighter in the same product
i find that this product is great because it's a hydration you can put on right before you start your makeup
i wasn't quite sure how to use this product at first
quite pointless although i love the idea of it
this moisturizer is nice, but not life changing.
it really helped to even out
i really love this product!
i really loved this product.
definitely recomend this to all skin types
this moisturizer is nice, but not life changing.
i think it absorbed pretty well into my skin.
the illuminator has caused me to get several compliments on my highlight so that's always good
after awhile of many uses i have really grown to love it
it really makes those cheekers shine
i really enjoy it to give my skin that extra pop.
honestly you could get away with just using it by itself which is another reason that i really liked this product
it's a 2 in one and really works well!
this product really works
i really liked this product
it is a really good highlighter is you don't want to over-do it
if it was the right color i would wear it everyday
would definitely recommend this product!
it makes my skin not only look amazing
really love this product a lot
not make me look like i'm an alien
it has become my go to product when i want to add a nice glow
definitely would recommend it to my friends!
but honestly, after trying it, i really like it.
the product definitely does what it said that it would do
i personally like to mix it in with my foundation for a glowing look
i think this would be great to mix in a foundation to give you that glow
it came out looking really pretty
i really liked the combination of this product.
it did make my skin look like it was glowing
don't really like to use it all over my face
it is something that sounds like it would be right up my alley- i am loving highlighting products right now
if you put it everywhere you might look a little greasy because it definitely is hydrating
it's really gives you a natural look.
all i really love this product
it definitely makes a difference
i really like this product.
i really liked the idea of this product.
made it look bad
i really love the stock in the cap as well
because my skin is pretty fair
i really liked this product!
estee lauder is obviously known for their skin care line
its so nice to see them br
at first i thought it was a weird product
wasn't really sure how to use it
when using this product i definitely don't
he was singing about this stuff
i definitely recommend this product.
it looks kind of crazy
i get complimented on my skin so much when i wear this
co-workers have commented on how nice my skin looks
people are always guessing around 32-40
feel weightless which is a lot coming from someone who is acne prone
which i actually appreciate as it warms up my skin
the beneficial ingredients are just a bonus because this is so pretty
this stuff makes me look so healthy and glowing.
was really surprised with how glowy my skin was
it feels really nice on
'm not sure how well it would mix with it or how well it will go on top as a highlight on the cheekbones
i love this highlighter so so much!
i love how glowy this makes me look.
you can build and it looks natural and pretty.
think this is a pretty good highlighter when used with a very light touch
definitely like that this is in liquid form
when i saw how perfect the glow was--not too much--i prayed the heat wouldn't ruin it
it isn't quite what i thought it was
got so many compliments on how dewy
for some reason i feel like you get a lot of product for the price
this is definitely the star of the line
it felt so good
it takes a lot for me to say that.
honestly i don’t feel any firmness
i am really enjoying this cream
even when i don’t believe i need really bad i might invest in it for just a great makeup day
i've pretty much never been able to find a cleanser that works for me
but this stuff is actually amazing.
as i love to try new things
i definitely recommend this eye cream!
this has been so good to my under eyes
has really made a difference in how they look
i guess because now they are well hydrated
i love the cool feeling i get when i apply it
you definitely don't need a lot to have that smooth
live by this stuff.
i like this stuff a lot.
have spent lots to find one that really works
the gentleman not only told me it was okay to have different items from different product lines
it seriously smells so nice
it leaves my skin feeling so nice
i love the feel
thank you for giving me my life backkkkk.
this was probably the first decent moisturizer i really used
this has honestly made my skin so smooth
i feel good knowing i'm putting clean ingredients onto my skin too
makes my face feel so smooth
this makes my skin feel and look flawless!
they're really good for your skin
no, really, this stuff is amazing.
it also does not have a greasy feeling so that's awesome
i felt like i'd tried everything to control my oil
the great thing about it is that it have no oily feeling to it after applied
it you put a good amount
my make up would look awful on my skin cause it was so dehydrated
it honestly feels like all three in one.
it works really well for my skin type and needs.
i like this a lot
i seem to have a nice
they always break me out
this one works wonders for me
i really love this stuff for winter
it has done wonders to my skin
this moisturizer worked really well for me.
i would recommend this to everyone who wants an amazing moisturizer
love how my skin feels.
my sephora runs out of this stuff quick
i don't know if this is for everyone as it is quite thick
what i love about this too is my makeup can grind right over this
whenever i use this product my skin definitely feels quenched
hated the way they dried so quick they never felt hydrating enough
this one i really needed to
i really needed a good moisturizer for my face
it really does everything that it says it will.
this is really not a hassle
it really focuses where it needs to
i really like this cream.
always go for said products
this is it for me
i feel perfectly confident not even wearing make up since this product has helped smooth my skin out so well
it always feel so fresh after using this product
makes my face feel amazing before make up application
she loved it too
i feel like i look more awake too!
i can tell i applied it by the feel
really want to try more de elephant!
my skin hasn't looked or felt this good my entire life
i think it's only good for summer because of how light it is
i honestly have mixed feelings about this product
guess that's a good sign
i love that you know what you are putting on your face
i love how it works with my makeup.
it works really well
the consistency is like nothing i've really felt before
i really enjoy it
this product is supposed to be paired together with something
i feel like i'm not getting as much moisture as i should with this product
i am constantly getting compliments on my skin
i would definitely recommend this product to anyone thinking about it
they suggested that this would be a good moisturiser for my skin type
for me moisturizer has always been something that i kinda loathe
refreshing when you put it on
i think that he likes that is blue too
i now use this stuff
this feels really good on the skin
feel it has balanced out my skin a bit
i just couldn't feel "wow!"
i realized this gel meant to be
it felt so good
honestly its great to mix with the clique gel if i need a bit more moisture
i got really red
definitely consider giving this a try!
inside there is a cylinder bottle so that whole thing is not actually filled with product
it's definitely grown on me
this is amazing if you're someone that needs hydration
well just whenever i feel i need some hydration
even if i thought the product was good
i do think it's good for the winter months
my skin does feel nice
mainly this bad boy right here.
my skin is like i said
not in an "oh-you-look-so-young" way
i feel like it also acts like a primer
after applying the tingle was really intense
i really like this product.
i really like this moisturizer.
i love the refreshing feel of this product
it has done wonders for my skin!
it hangs on for quite awhile
the first time i used it i couldn't stop touching my face it felt so nice
i really love it
i liked the consistency
how it felt on my skin
she seems to really like the product too
i really love this.
i really like it
i just needed something to put on before my makeup to make my skin look a little dewy
personally i kinda like it
it does a great job of giving me just the right amount of moisture
however i have to take away a star bc for me the smell is incredibly strong
the title says it all about this product: it really does give your skin a deep breath from all the toxins we take in from our surroundings
wonderful product for an always on the go person who needs hydration back in their skin
i like the light feel of this as well as the fresh feeling it leaves on my face
it makes you skin feel like angels have kissed it
i think this is it
i actually really like the smell of this product
i love how this works for me.
when the lady put it on me i feel in love it with makes my face feelso soft take thes red out
i recently had rich anger up how i did my skin care because of really really bad breakouts
this one works for me
i find this product amazing it has clearly help my skin i have sensitive skin anything breaks me out
the moment i applied it to my skin not only did it smell great
i love how it does not leave my skin looking greasy at all
she loves the cucumber smell so that worked out well
i really like this moisturizer.
was hard to find in skin care
would definitely recommend this to everyone.
it makes my face feel great
i actually really loved it
i really like using this product.
i definitely really like this product
how invigorating it feels when it's working
although i really like this cleanser
my makeup always looks terrible because of it
the overall result is so great i don't really care
my skin felt great afterward with no overdrying feeling
really saw some nice results
definitely going to keep buying!
so for me to give a 5 star is pretty special.
this is one that definitely does.
i liked it a lot
but this was okay.
i really liked this deep cleanser.
i've noticed that it really gets into my pores
thought i'd give this a whirl
i am really loving it for my combo skin
i know i am going to especially love this during the summertime
i put this stuff on
this is the only thing to use when you look tired
love the way it feels
it really does work.
he told to use to a little bit
the big misconception is that people expect it to be for moisture
it definitely does brighten the eye area
i never really had dark circles
i actually really like this product.
it's really great to see how my under eye area looks
love how this makes my eyes feel
i am a new mom and you know sleep comes last!
i am obsessed with rens eye gel so this was a no brainer for me
i think the big misconception people have with this product is that they think it is an eye cream when it is actually
this is the only product ever that i feel tighten on my eye
too bad i'm not sure if it works as a treatment because makes skin feel kinda dry
i am always in search of anything to make my eyes look brighter
neck that just makes me look tired
guys, you need to give this product a try!
we men need to take care of our skin, too!
it definitely keeps my skin "looking alive" without making it feel like i got a ton of product on
this is my go to essence.
i really think it makes a big difference
i do really like it
especially since i'm not really happy with my moisturizer at the moment
i think it would be great for all skin types
i loved it so much i went back
the combo seems to suit me well
it felt so good
what probably caught me the most was the smell
i wasn't sure if i really liked this stuff or it was just a combination of all the products i use in my everyday regimen until the other night i was extremely exhausted
the way this makes my skin feel
i got this as a sample because it looked kind of fun
i got this as a perk
i just loved how it felt
it is actually working.
i love how it so light and the smell is amazing.
i definitely notice it brightening up my skin
i feel like it just works for me on days that i don't feel like adding a lotion-like moisturizer
the oh so light citrus scent as you first put it on is really nice
i live in such a humid area i knew my face was going to start to feel weighed down
i really love the way this makes my skin feel.
i would definitely not call this a strong scent
i feel in love
this stuff has been magic for me
i just love this stuff
keep in mind everyone's body chemistry is different so what works for one will not work for another
my advice would be get a nice size samples to see how this works for you
makes my skin feel so good!
it is definitely something i am considering purchasing
i personally think the smell is amazing!
seems to compliment everything else i use
i love the way it smells too!
s for an easier application it drys kinda fast so be mindful of how you apply over your face
the very first day i could physically feel the difference it was making
the way it makes my skin feel
i like to use it before i do my makeup i feel like it really freshens up my face
'm bummed i couldn't use it fast enough without making this little mistake
gives me hope that i'll still feel that way 10
it kinda worked but not that great.
this stuff is insane.
love how it makes my face feel tight
i kind of liked it -- i thought it was nice
i got on to check what people thought
i don't think it's really that strong at all.
as for the smell, i really like it!
luckily i have my friends
and i really love the smell of it.
there really is something to this formula
i am so in love with this stuff!
'm sure the big bottle lasts a long time
i can feel the difference as well
can already feel a difference in my skin
i really do appreciate the results
it really just feels amazing
know that my skin will still get a good clean
i really love this product.
i've gotten so many compliments about how great my skin looks
i personally find it light
i really liked it from the first day it deserve every penny
it really gives you a chance to see the difference it makes in your skin
i, personally, like the smell.
it's actually very pleasant
t's a good idea to let it dry before you even put on your moisturiser
the glow everyone is talking about is definitely real
this has done wonders for my skin.
said "jesus- you look so young lately
i don't feel like i have anything on my face
the way it makes my skin feel
i know it sounds too good to be true
if you want to say good bye to fine lines
definitely recommend this product.
i never in my life thought i would be comfortable without makeup on my skin
interesting thing i noticed is it some how makes my makeup look seamless
so trying to find the right balace is sometimes tough
i also suffer fatigue from late nights so needless to say my skin can look really tired
even on days when im really tired my skin doesnt look so tired
i just love the youth it brings out in my skin
i always try to drink lots of water which can make a huge difference in my skin
can have this stuff
you can feel it tighten your skin as well
this is just a dream.
it feels so good going on
i wanted to really like it for how much i loved lingering scent on my face
i feel as if i am feeding my skin
this is definitely a must try!
just using a few drops, you feel the difference!
do my makeup for me
after using this my skin felt like
i don't wear a whole lot of makeup
it made me get tired of it
it seems to work pretty well
this product has evened out my skin tone quite a bit
pump however i feel like the pump
definitely see a difference compared with my old cleansers
i mainly got this product because i wanted something that would brighten my skin
i really love the results i get from this cleanser
my skin feels so feel after
i felt like all it did was just clean my face i wanted something more
so that is pretty annoying.
have had combo skin my whole life
after my dermatologist basically told me there was nothing we could do
i think that this is an okay cleanser
this was not doing anything good for me during that time
it definitely didn't make me feel as clean as i would have liked
i think the combination works well
it definitely takes off all the make up
this stuff is so amazing
this thing works wonders.
my skin does not feel tight
i love how it makes my skin feel
you can feel it working so definitely avoid eyes or open skin
i really liked the mascara
will definitely keep using it.
really like all the products in this set.
only started doing something about it just now
the first time i tried this i remember looking in the mirror thinking my makeup looked really good
this product made my skin feel amazing.
you gotta pay the price for the best stuff
they all have a bit of smell
it's still going strong
this product made my skin feel amazing.
my makeup goes on like a dream
it definitely helped with my under eye circles tremendously
my under eye circles are not horrible
your face will really see the benefits
i really don't care
i just thought it was doing ok on my mostly oily/combination skin
this is one of those things that may not work for everyone because everyone's skin is different
i also really like the smell.
my skin hasn't looked this good in over 2 years.
it has done a lot for my acne scaring
my skin looks so healthy when i use this that it's hard to go without
my skin always feel so nice after i've used it
my skin has honestly never looked better.
also love how cool it feels when i put it on my skin
i know how much it is to make this kind of stuff
people all the time tell me how great my skin looks
it just makes my skin really even
the poor folks at my local sephora are probably sick of seeing me return so many things i don't like
didn't think i would like it because my skin is so sensitive to everything especially moisturizers for some reason
my skin really loves it
people have commented on how bright my skin looks after using this
i like this just fine
while it certainly doesn't make my skin worse i also feel like it isn't doing anything amazing for me
a nice light moisturizer that does pretty well under makeup if you let it sit for a few minutes
it feels so good on your face
my skin had never looked so good.
hated it because i felt like it was just sitting in my skin all night doing nothing
i can tell you my skin has never looked better
this product really does a great job at adding moisture back to the skin
every time i put it on, i feel so refreshed!
i just love that it is very light weight
i always always always wash my face before putting this cream on
honestly my skin has never looked better
my skin has never felt or looked better.
i really liked it, it's just very pricey.
together it's been working really well to reduce redness
i've always had pretty good skin.
always have some on hand.
my skin started getting so flawless
it seems to work really well for me!
just to give you an idea
honestly this stuff is so good!
i really wasn't expecting a whole lot
really liked the way it felt on my skin
sometimes when we look at ourselves everyday
my light moisturizer just wasn't doing anything for me
call me crazy i like it because that makes me think it's working lol
my skin tone looks really even
i saw some comments says it goes well under makeup too
'm gonna try that
pretty much everything hurts on my cheek in winter
if you need nice finishing touch
i really like this product
that stinks too because my skin really responded to this formula
lots of really wonderful hydrating products do tend to break me out
not everyone loved the smell
if that makes sense
i love how it makes my skin feel
this is like that
i've honestly been trying to find a moisturizer that works with my skin for 15 years
heard good things about the br
i guess we really are all made differently
what works great for one of us might be terrible for someone else
i feel more people wouldn't feel so on the fence about purchasing this product
either way, i really love this product.
they really know what they are doing!
i definitely would love to purchase it
love everything about this product.
i am glad it is summertime now because the lightness
you don't need a lot of this cream to get the job done
it actually helped my unever skin
i really like it!
i've always been a fan of clarins because their products work
i really don't see any miracles worked on my skin since using this product
i feel like this product gave my skin just enough moisture
telling me how good my skin looks- after two weeks of me using this product
my skin looks just as great at 29 as it did when i was 23
try it out first i would love to love it more if maybe fragrance wasn't too strong maybe that's what it made me break out
this product is the only thing that works for me.
i get a lot of compliments on my skin
this works wonders for me
so so so great
it really did work miracles for me
i've always had a problem with acne
obviously no product will work for everybody
this little guy is for you
this definitely does the trick
i'll definitely be making this a skin care routine staple
it definitely calms down
i guess you can use it as a spot treatment for a really sore spot
it felt like my skin had d
it was just doing its job
i don't know if my hormones are just being nice
i wanted to see if it'd completely clear up my acne
i liked the idea of laser focus
i would definitely recommend this product for anyone who has acne prone skin
i don't think it has really cleared up my acne.
afterwards my skin to not feel tired at all
i feel like my face is smoother
the small area for the product to come out of is really annoying
my skin hates everything, but it loooves this.
i definitely recommend it.
it never feels greasy
did not make my skin feel heavy
you get a lot of product
i really like this product
just what my skin needed!
i hate that especially when i have makeup on
i can honestly just wear this moisturizer day-to-day
i just really love this moisturizer.
which i still love
my makeup went over it really nicely today.
it very helping me
i loved how this felt on my skin
had a light refreshing scent that i really liked while not clogging my pores at all
this stuff is just so amazing
let me tell you this is amazing
it feels like it probably has silicones in it.
i think i will definitely continue to use
what it did for me was amazing
i loved this product because it really did hydrate my skin
when i do its so refreshing
my advisor told me i needed a different kind of moisturizer now
really love how my skin looks
i like how light it is.
it does have that water feel to it
i got this stuff in my sephora play box
it makes my skin feel so cool
which i really enjoy
it really does feel like a drop of water on your face
definitely try this out.
will buy again when i'm done because you get a pretty good amount for the price
wanted to try something different
seriously so lightweight it feels like i have nothing
nothing too wow wow
i really like it and it is very light weight.
it also made my foundation look so smooth in my problem areas
'm always hesitant to try different moisturizers
it really does help my skin on these really cold days
did really like it
gives me all day
it's hard for me to find products that are actually good at providing moisture for me
personally this is the first one i have tried that goes on light doesn't feel like a lotion it's nice
i look forward to using it every morning because it feels so good on my skin
wears really well under makeup for me as well.
it really feels like water
love everything about this product!!
it is really light
makes me smile every time i put it on
i love the way it leaves my skin looking
it feels so good every time i put it on
i like that i can feel it working.
besides, can you really put a price on good skin?
i love how this makes my skin feel so plump
it would feel great after a day at the beach.
it really helped my skin
i really really recommend this product
i did quite a lot of research on different serums before i decided to try this one
i am not sure if this particular combination is what makes this so amazing
which i admit using it again is very nice
yet really keeps moisture in
people just say, "your skin is beautiful."
i've always had bad dark circles
will probably last a really really long time because a tiny bit is all you need
i noticed my eyes got bad really fast.
but it definitely feels softer!)3.
since i've also been doing a lot of other things like eating clean
i've had everyone tell me that my skin is glowing
it doesnt really feel greasy
i could feel the difference
give my honest opinion
it really helped to even out my skin
was honestly pretty skeptical to try it out because i'd had a lot of failed facial oils in the past
what it does do is leave my skin feeling very smooth
i am in love with the way it makes my skin look
actually felt like i looked beautiful
my skin looked that good
3-4 was plenty for my whole face.
this stuff is really thick
i'd always steer clear of all products because i was afraid my skin would break out
i feel like this product definitely leaves your skin glowing
the way it makes my skin feel is like nothing i have felt before
i loved that it didn't make my face feel greasy afterwards
the only thing i would like is if came with a pump because it was hard to get out of the bottle sometimes
've got this even
not really an oil
i really enjoy it
just a reminder you have to shake it very well before you use it
right to pretty much everyone
my skin definitely felt rejuvenated
like what i see
i hate using amlactin on my arms because it always seems to burn
kinda sits on my skin
it was really painful for me to buy this oil because of the price
this stuff is really gentle
it takes a lot to impress me
this stuff is a game changer for me.
it is doing something right
because i am now addicted to the stuff
i really like it
was scared it would make my skin like an oil slick
this product really lives up to the hype!
i feel like i should say that part in all caps since it is so awesome
this stuff is pretty pricy
i really like it
i love that look and feeling!
i feel like my face has never looked better since i started using it
i now feel like i underst
if my budget allows i would definitely buy this product to keep my skin looking beautiful
my face hasn't felt this good in years.
you definitely made me believe in you
in exchange i have to give my honest review so here goes
knowing that my skin does not look like a snake is good enough for me
since using this face oil my skin looks so young
it makes my skin feel amazing
you have to make sure that you shake the bottle super good to make sure that the product is well mixed
i feel like my skin is just glowing
my face has never looked so good!!!
it is always a great idea to buy skin care products with a pump or a dispenser like this one
never liked the greasy feeling
honestly the idea of an oil terrified me
great things to say about this oil
i truly liked the way it smelt too.
i really love this
refreshing scent that i really enjoy too
none really restore my skin like the way it used to
let me just say this facial oil actually feels great
i would definitely recommend this to all my beauty junkies out there
the first day my coworkers remarked on how great my skin looked
i really wanted to try this product after seeing it advertised
i don't like to waste my hard earned money
it's not perfume so who really cares what it smells like as long as it works?
commented that my skin looked really nice
thank you for backing up your claims with an honestly good product
have heard lots of good things about this br
i don't feel i need to
i really like this moisturizer.
i really enjoy the gel texture in combination with all of my other products
i actually enjoy the smell
then it goes away which was great because the smell was quite strong to begin with
once applied this stuff was sucked up by my skin making it feel extremely smooth
it does not make me break out, great product!
my skin has never look
this felt amazing i don't think hydrate is a word big enough
it definitely makes my eyes feel so much better!
it's taken me forever to find something that works for my skin
everyone always says the smell turns them off
you get a lot of product
i really like the way it feels light
this is what it would feel like
makes my skin feel amazing
even my girlfriends think my skin looks nuts
this is so cool feeling when you first put it on
anyway it just works great for me
i know it sounds weird
i feel like i sleep better when i use this mask
it makes my skin feel so cool
i literally said, "wow!
feels really light on the skin
it feels so refreshing going on.
i believe in this stuff.
i find that it is really light weight
i always look for a good moisturizer
over all it feels like i'm wearing no makeup
it has bothered me when i do my makeup because my lids are so different
i like this stuff.
you do not need 1 whole pump for both eyes
this is the first eye cream that's actually worked for me
it is hard to find something that can take away those dark circles
looking like you've just lost the prize fight is not a flattering look
this immediately made my skin feel better!
it's worked out so well for me
before i used this i would be looking pretty tired with some dark circles
i dont really have puffy eyes however there is a nice cooling effect
just used it because it felt nice under eyes.
i can definitely see the difference
it feels like nothing
i love this stuff so much!
i would say this definitely calms my eyes down
feel cooleness for a long time
which feels like it does work
this really does the trick.
i got this because i loved the feel of the tingle
not really depuffing or help with the dark circles
application is so easy i love the stick i wish more products came this way
it definitely helps wake me up
could feel it growing
have really loved it
it works so good on me
the feel is good just after you apply it on eye
it's not moisture enough for keep the good feel
if for just instant feel
i love how my eyes look now
i love the way it feels when i apply it
i kind of love it.
i noted how nice it felt when applying it
or this stuff works
have raved about it to everyone i know
this made me feel like i had just washed my face
it definitely has a bit of a menthol feel
i am going to carry it in my purse so that i can get that nice refreshed feeling all summer
i don't know if it really does make my puffy eyes look better
they definitely feel better
something easy to put on
it's really soothing and great under make up too.
it's become a really nice part of my morning ritual
felt so great on my easily inflamed
this is so so so refreshing!!
feels so good on the face
although a nice product you can use the laneige sleeping mask for the same results
i feel so great when i wake up!
i really love this product it hydrates my skin so well
i feel like my skin does look brighter.
getting to skip that step is huge to me.
i always make sure to have on h
i feel i went through it in not time.
but it smells so good!!!!
while it certainly seems to help with that
if that makes sense
it makes my skin feel
i pretty much use this for my back
i really do like this product if you're a college student
my fiance thinks it makes his skin tight
definitely going to keep using
my face just feels so smooth
i am really loving this whole line!
this product is so nice on your body
which i find really pleasant at the end of the day
everyone close to me is starting to ask what i use for my perfect skin
really makes me glow and no more breakouts too!
this mask makes my face feel so smooth
i definitely recommend if you are looking to improve blemishes
or just want to improve your skin all together
this mask is super intense and it really works.
my acne felt better
this product really does the trick!
i can see a huge difference with just one use.
i really love it i can see the difference in my skin
i am really enjoying the texture of the mask
keep in mind guys that this is a mask that has sulfur sooo with that being said
jelly like formula that feels great going on the skin
definitely helps clarify the skin no matter what skin type
so everyone is getting on the mask b
really noticed a difference in my skin.
it does feel nice
it definitely leaves me with more of a flawless finish
it feels like nothing on, in a good way.
i love all things bosica.
if your skin is pretty even this is enough
i really like this
i like this because i have tried many products that say they do the same- a nice soft glow on the skin
i saw a lot of reviews on here that say this product was not good for dry skin
i got this as a sample size just to try out because i love finding a good mask
honestly for how great my skin looks
you don't really get used to it
it makes my skin feel amazing afterwards.
it certainly took the pain
the way it feels
my skin feels so smooth after applying this everytime
really evens out my skin tone!
really confused why the reviews are so bad
i guess everyone's skin is different.
i wanted a good spf for everyday use
break out really easy
it definitely is very cooling
this really holds my makeup in place
makes ;my skin feel really smooth.
i don't feel like people do a very good job of explaining how to use it
i happen to be a person who appreciates fast
how i've been doing it works great for me
just overall is not the best for me personally
it was really refreshing to see a result on my skin in just a few seconds
i saw the other reviews about getting irritations so make sure you are using it properly
this feels so good when it's on the skin.
my skin loves this stuff
which is good because i feel like i ignore my neck a lot
i really do like this product
it also gave me this glowy effect
this made my skin feel nice
i feel like putting it in the fridge
it felt really good on my face
i do feel like this one is great for morning
i really enjoy this cream.
wanted to try it for myself
the scent is light and i really enjoy these.
i wanted to see what this moisturizer was all about
one bead was not enough to cover my whole face
this product definitely does what it says.
this product definitely helped my makeup stay on
this makes my foundation look
really hope it is good anti aging.
i also feel like me skin appears smoother
this one is definitely a keeper!
you must make sure your face is really damp
am always buying new things
this is it for me
it makes my make up look really good
this stuff is life changing
i love how this stuff takes care of my lack of hydration in my skin
they all feel basically similar-soft
that's ok with me since i have my own regimen to take care of that
i put this one and the consistency was weird.
my skin looked sooooooo good
i definitely notice a huge difference on my skin
feels really smooth on my skin.
because i feel like the makes foundation slide off my face
i don't personally feel a lifting effect with the skin
this one is the first product that i can actually feel a difference when i'm using it
none of them make my makeup look as great
i love how well it keeps my make-up on.
if you're older, this is a great product.
kind of hard to smooth around face
it really sticks to the primer
working with children just about perfectly
i would definitely recommend it.
liked that save me time in my skin care rutine when i use make up
it seemed too good to be true for it to really grip my makeup all day
my makeup really does last
i like the idea of this primer
seeing as how i have really really dry skin
it really does grip to my makeup
it made my make up sit so nicely, i love it.
definitely helps the staying power of foundation
it is definitely that.
this product did give me some shine
it really does make my makeup stay all day
i really like the innovation of it
i think that i'll grow to like it
it feels like you're wearing nothing
this stuff is so odd.
i feel like it helps my make up last for days
this stuff really does grip your makeup
loved it every time!
this stuff is seriously amazing.
this stuff makes my foundation last all day
this product makes me excited to apply my makeup because i know my hard work will last all day
when you learn how to work with it
my makeup looked so good even at the end of day.
said it would really stick the foundation on tight
and bit was he right!
that's very different from anything else i've tried
i don't really like to wear foundation/make-up
my skin is plumped up really well
i always recommend this product to my friends
i really like what this product does for my pre-makeup morning routine
saves soooo much of your time as well.
i really believe this has hugely reduced my acne marks as nothing else in my skincare changed
i love this mask and the whole concept!!
this product has done just that.
it has done wonders for my skin
i really like this product
i am definitely seeing some results
make my skin so nice
i feel like i'm breaking out less
this stuff is really amazing!
it really has helped to clear my acne.
i feel like it's helping with the healing process
it has a bit of a learning curve if you use it in the shower like i do
the cap that you measure it out in is pretty big
so you get a good amount to use
which is always a plus
it works really well.
i really like it and i am seeing great results.
i think they have also helped with my skin texture
i remember my skin feeling very firm
you get over that very quickly-- the results are amazing
when i put this on my skin feels so tight
i would definitely recommend it
definitely recommend this product!
never really considered estee lauder for my cleanser
estée lauder isn't really my jam
i would definitely try this out.
i love how it feels as it dries on my skin
i love the way it makes my skin feel
the first thing i noticed is how i love the way this mask feels on the skin
i hope this works for you too, good luck!
my face could definitely feel the mask working its magic
something seems different about this mask
how my skin feels
i feel it working
it was just very clean
that being said i am very picky about what i put on my face
and let me tell you it is amazing.
it leaves your skin feeling great after you use it
they smell so good
i feel that helped out
especially with all of this heat happening
it really helps to keep things matte all day.
really helps make up to stay in place
it works really well for me
these drops are pretty cool.
wow this product really did my foundation justice
my skin will come out looking so smooth
it work very well for me.
no matter what it is it still beautiful
they feel amazing on your face
i would definitely recommend!
my skin mattified just as it said it would
i don't know how it would work with very oil skin
i am going to try keeping it with me
all in all i really do like this product
i always get super excited when something new comes out because i have never found something that will control my oil
maybe i got a bad one
some things really are not too good to be true.
this is just crazy!
hopefully looks like my skin
i mix two drops of this stuff with my foundation
i really can see a difference
t's hard for you to notice
your skin just feels good
the lotion is quite nice too for every other day use
i can really see how it's evening out my skin tone
definitely added to my holy grail collection.
it's always good to early to take care of yourself it is smoothing
it's not to bad being 50 when your skin looks great
love how it makes my foundation look
i feel like i use way less makeup
the way it makes my skin feel
i feel like i literally look younger
really like how fresh my skin looks when the makeup is off
i really liked this eye cream because it was not greasy in my undereye area
this eye cream really does the trick!
none of the products really worked for me
i definitely don't get enough sleep
try this stuff out!
makes me feel like it's actually doing something
i feel like i'm already seeing results after 3 uses morning
i really enjoy this
it is definitely making the skin look plump
i think this is the type of eye cream perfect for women who want to prevent lines
i really love this moisturizer!
goes on so easy
this stuff feels like a dream
definitely makes a huge difference in how my products go on
they work together very well
love the feel and smell of this.
i really like that you get all the multitasking benefits in one cream
i think this is a really good moisturiser
certainly would've loved it in my 30s
this felt good on my skin went in well
it makes my skin feel great, and not greasy!
especially if you want something oil free
i really never thought of a serum until i was talking to the cast member at my sephora who recommended this product
i really like this moisturizer
it goes really well under makeup
i definitely want to try more from this br
leaves my skin feeling so plump without the oily feel which is something i never thought i would find in my life
this feels so good to put on after i wash my face
i quite like this as a night cream
feel it is the "real deal" in its ability to get moisture into my skin
it just makes my skin feel so good
i feel like i can't put into words how much good this product has done for my skin
a lot really goes a long way
i find that this suits me very well
before talking to my wonderful senior skin advisor i always thought i was oily
honestly, my skin has never looked better.
it works so perfectly
this cream helps me in that sense
i wake up with my skin feeling nice
i never had a greasy feel to my face
because i swear this stuff softens your skin incredibly
it's definately worth a shot to see how you enjoy it
i really wanted to buy this at first because of the cute packaging
my skin feels really good in the morning
i am most definitely buying the full size being that it has done wonders for my dry skin around nose
people have commented on how young im looking
i do really like it
i feel like this is the moisturizer either you really love or you really hate
i definitely love this product
had heard good things
and feel very nice on the face too!
i just love how light it feels on my face
second the product is really great if your someone with oily skin you would probably like this better than the oil
this makes my skin feel amazing!
it sinks into the skin so nicely i absolutely love the stuff when you run out will be re-purchasing a little pricey
let me start by saying i have really
that really did help
i've gotten compliments on my skin looking nice since i started using it
another thing is the weird smell
this stuff has transformed my skin.
wow my skin feels so good
i really enjoy this moisturizer.
hard to find products that work for my skin
i am amazed that a rich cream like this does not break me out
i find it really hard to find a product that targets
you don't need a whole lot.
it feels like a dream on the skin
i really do feel that it resembles my happy summer skin
the eyes are the most fun part to really glam up
i really loved this moisturizer
i love how my face feels after this.
i want to start trying it in the mornings too
really like the new
i like to try a lot of different products
this product really helped turn my skin around
i wanted to try something different
still felt lousy but my skin looked good.
it really does transform my skin
i assume that it is very good
the price tag made me a little sad
my skin has never felt softer
i really like the smell
it's pretty much exactly as described
my skin always looks great after i use it
i really like this mask because it really does mattify the skin in a few minutes
i love the way my face feels after
so glad i took a chance on this stuff even though i have normal to dry skin
it really worked wonders for me
because nothing has been so over-the-top amazing like this stuff is
really love this for summer!
i feel like this gives a great deep clean without leaving my skin overdry
this moisturizer is definitely worth a try if you want something to even out your skin
it's definitely not super sheer
my mom tried a little
i got her obsessed on it too
i don't think it's really much of a moisturizer personally
i really liked this product
my only complaint is it makes me feel very oily
i want it to get all up in my skin
every time i wear it under my foundation people constantly comment on how pretty my skin looks
i do feel it gives me that very glowwy
definitely will recommend this product!
i don't think anything else has worked as well on my combination skin
i see a lot of people have an issue with the scent
my skin has never looked better honestly.
it wears well and looks really pretty.
it'll be a sad day when my sample runs out
i kid all of you not
not only did this product keep my skin looking great throughout the entire day
it just looked strange
i've loved every one i've gotten.
so this moisturizer is just right for me
my face loves this stuff
but i think its good.
all the hype definitely left me wanting to try it
just really like the way my skin feels
i really love how this looks on my skin!
i really like this moisturizer
it smells really, really good.
a very hard time finding a good moisturizer
told me how amazing my face smelled
i really like it
i really, really want to buy it.
so this is obviously not everyone's cup of tea
i really like it.
i just wear it by itself and i love it.
glowy i was amazed the whole day
honestly the smell is so amazing
really enjoy the effect
on days when i feel like i'm super tired
even liked how it looked with out any makeup
with makeup i like as well it made my face look really smooth
i am pretty in love with this product!
definitely evens up my skin tone a bit
really love the way it feels light on my face
the only thing i don't like about it is the weird smell
love the feel and smell of this product.
to me i think it looks better
i don't know the last time my face makeup looked this good
nothing bad to say at all my skin looks beautiful
i don't feel like it really moisturizes my skin more than any other product
which is really saying something because i have very dry skin
i really am a fan.
i don't think my under-eyes have looked this good since i was a teenager
any improvement that makes us feel
it smells really bad?
it looks weird but it really works.
i wanted a product that would brighten my skin
this stuff feels so nice on the skin.
it seems like it is pretty pricey
i think this would work on all skin types.
i love the smell, the feel, the results.
my skin really likes all the goodies
i really love the consistency of this
not really going in
she looks years younger honestly.
i really do like this oil
i can look past that because this oil is so nice
but i always get one.
it is sooooooo good!
i always wondered how her skin looked so flawless
this face wash is sooo good.
i absolutely believe this cleanser is a key factor in my skin getting better
really helps keep my skin clear
this face wash has honestly changed my skin.
i feel like it does a great job at cleansing my skin
i definitely recommend trying this
i love it because it takes off all of my makeup
i got it in my mouth so that wasn't good
it cleans everything very well
if nothing is working for you this is definitely the product that will
this is a really nice cleanser for getting rid of the day
i really like it
usually love everything they put out
i will for sure keep using this stuff
this leaves my skin feeling so nice
made my skin feel amazing
this product made me try the whole pep start line
the way my skin felt after using it
which a lot of people look for
man i really wish it was healthy to use this stuff everyday without over exfoliating because girl i love it
i love how my clarisonic makes my face feel super clean
definitely not for everyday use
get the job done
ok so love is an understatement for this product
flaky it honestly was just terrible
my face feels really smooth after using it
does a good job at removing all my makeup.
overall, i really like this cleanser.
nothing would seem to really help my face
definitely does what it says it does
i wanted to try something different to help with dullness
i think it's pretty amazing
i really like it
my skin has never felt or looked this good!
it also doubles as a primer for me because it really helps my foundation stick
it really does blur pores especially if you use a primer as well
can be used with a primer on top if i feel like i need it
wears really well under makeup
if you're having trouble finding a good primer fit
can definitely tell a difference.
this does a pretty good job keeping my face matte
it really makes my face matte looking after applying
i feel in love with it
i've tried a lot of samples of primers that weren't very good or were ok
loved it so much i got a big one
received in my sephora play and really loved it.
i think this would be great under a bb cream or for a no makeup day
i am definitely going to purchase this.
making it nice for travel so you don't have to bring as many products
so this is a win for me.
really like the texture of this
i noticed something that day as well
i really enjoyed trying this product.
it works just as it says.
it really makes your makeup stay put!
using this before i put on my makeup makes my skin look so good
what i love about the product is how it absorbs into my skin
the consistency is a little weird
i do really like this
i still love it
really like this as primer.
i really like this eye cream!
it smells so good i'm going to be sad when i run out of it
if i'm going to spend good money on a moisturizer
i’ve always had pretty clear skin
it was also always
this stuff makes my skin so smooth it feels like velvet
love the texture and how it feels on my face.
feels really amazing going on
i've tried so maybe different creams
i needed a moisturizer for awhile
a lot of them made my skin break out or feel really sticky
i love that it is okay to put around your eyes
there is just something different about it
it really makes a difference in how my face looks
you really need to know how to work with this product
my skin has never looked or felt better.
the smell is very nice too
some people thing the smell is too strong
you can really feel it tightening your skin
this really did the job
feels so good on the skin
omly told me my skin looks "amazing"
he's not big on compliments at all so that's like telling a girl she looks like her most envied celebrity
it felt amazing applying it to my skin.
this stuff seemed to be a life saver.
i really like the smell
i feel like it helps my face not become an oil slick
it really helps with the lines
that means my shin is really getting what it needs each time
how my skin feels
one pump is enough for my whole face
this paired with a gel primer gave me that glowing-not shiny- look that i never thought i could have
never really liked them
keep that in mind when you are thinking about this product
always wanted to try some of their products
i really dislike the smell
i definitely recommend this to everyone
i honestly feel like my skin feels firmer
i honestly noticed a change in my skin right away
being 56 i see what creams honestly do for skin texture
always loved how that felt so this was right up my alley
made my skin feel like a baby's bottom
my face really does feel softer
i'll definitely keep a bottle around
i don't know how i feel about putting eggs on my skin still
i felt weird about the egg part of this product
it left my skin kinda
i don't feel that way about this one.
this moisturiser feels so good
one pump is enough for my whole face
i love the smell and feel of it.
i liked the feel of it
it soaks in really well
this is my first time trying from too cool for school products
i really like this moisturizer!
have to say i love how this feels on my skin.
i love the way it looks.
fresh aid beauty for making me feel pretty
definitely meant for fair
love how it feels going when applying.
i like the idea of it
this is definitely a different kind of moisturizer
although the packaging is definitely not as cute
after one use this stuff made my skin look great
this stuff will change your life
i genuinely feel this has been a true blessing for my skin
i always look forward to using this
you only need one pump for your whole face
i really like this product
i really have had success with this one
i really love this moisturizer!
you guys i am telling you this is money well spent
about half way using it i felt my skin was so much softer it was incredible
this made my skin feel like a new skin
it kind of helped with my acne
this stuff right here
this was the product that made everyone ask "why does your skin look so good
honestly the packaging spoke to me
i definitely recommend it to people with similar problems or even if you have dry/combo skin bc it works great under makeup as well
i truly love it so much
also super glad it worked for me because it was so expensive
it makes my skin feel amazing.
i feel application is easier
definitely my go to morning time moisturizer
i feel like the tatcha line truly repairs my skin to do what make-up is covering up
seriously my face looks amazing
seriously good if you have bad pores!
i think you should definitely try it out
if you want something really glowy
$68 is a pretty big price tag for the amount of product you do get
i really love it
the gold also made me feel super spoiled
i really like this moisturizer
love the way they feel my make up stay all day with a glow to it
i love all things tatcha
i admit this one is just a like for me
don't get me wrong, it's a very nice product.
very different to anything else i've ever used

it really is too-notch skin care
i would definitely recommend this.
bottle feels big but it's not really.
love how it has made my skin look
i really like the light weight feeling.
i cannot believe how great my skin looked at the end of the day
girls who don't want to always look completely matte
which is easy to do because it feels so smooth
i really love this product
it really helps contain my oil
ladies lets face it summer is here
i love a lot if the tatcha products
so that's why i think it is this product that makes my skin feel smoother than before
absorbs really quickly and feels so nice.
this stuff has been pretty amazing
i do feel like you get quite a lot of product in the bottle
then my face feels amazing
i believe the charcoal really helped some of my pimples
it is really nice to use when my skin is extra oily- it feels like it gets my skin very clean
i love how easy it is to use.
it definitely does the job.
i definitely recommend this!
it's still going strong

i do not feel like this irritates it
i love how clean my face feels afterwards.
always leaves my skin looking
just enough to get the job done
this one does the job perfectly
make my skin feel amazing
then i let this product sit on my face so all the awesome ingredients soak in
it really helps clear up my face this has been my favorite exfoliator pretty much since tarte released it
ok let me first start by saying that this product is a savior for drunk nights/hungover mornings when i just don't feel like putting the effort into my routine
it gets 5 stars just for that purpose.
seriously in love because nothing really works well for my skin
everyone that i have had try it loves it as well.
feel like i'm wasting it
how it really gets in there to clean out your pores
effort into their products really show
it's a great little stick i love the application.
i really liked this product

we both agree that our skin feels softer after use
he especially loves to use this after he shaves because it really makes his face feel extra soft
my skin feels really smooth
i definitely need to look in the mirror when using this product to see where i have put the product

always makes my skin so smooth
i definitely noticed a difference in my skin after only one time of using it
your skin is definitely left feeling softer
i really like this product a lot.
my skin just loved this mask.
but, as they say, beauty is definitely pain!!
'm not sure what everyone is complaining about
my face felt so smooth
the colour was just so darn pretty
i feel like a lot of peel off masks do
just moisturizer afterwards made my face look so nice
the colour is so pretty.
i really like this face peel!
i really like this.
it's a shame because this is a really nice product
yes it's definitely strong at first
over all i really like this mask!
seems like a lot is needed to cover the whole face thoroughly
it makes me cry a bit
it always leaves my skin feeling great afterwards
so you don't smell it for the whole twenty
i would definitely recommend this mask to anyone who needs a pick-me-up in their skin regime
i really like it.
personally i like that too
love that it has a good amount of spf too.
i think it was just the acne i was going through
i really like this moisturizer.

one pump is all that's needed for my whole face
i love everything about it
it burns my eyes so that's why this is my go to for the morning
when i pair it with my spinbrush i get a really great deep clean
i feel like is nice
works really well with my skin
it seriously feels like i have just taken off a face mask
i seriously love this stuff!
i really love this cleanser!!
i heard great things about this line from a youtuber
this product really helps with acne!!
my skin always feels so tight for days after using one
i got it in the mango scent hopefully they keep it permanent because it smells so nice
it's definitely been helping me with my breakouts too
look so good afterwards
it works wonders on my skin
would definitely recommend this mask.
this feels so good on the skin
this mask is everything is says it is!!
as i don't always have a lot of time to do masks
i do feel it did only s tad better of a job then cleaning timer
so for that it's good so deserves 5*
i really enjoy this mask.
i love how easy to use it is.
even he admits it's amazing
i can definitely see the difference.
i always hated how dirty my enlarged pores looked
my skin felt amazing afterwards
it makes me break out alot
this was definitely a life changer.
i love the way this mask feels on my face
i really do like the way it feels
makes my skin feel
gets the job done
i don't know how well this has helped my skin
it feels great on the skin as a mask- i prefer to use it as
my skin feels insane after using this.
i got this as a 100 pt reward just for fun
this moisturizer definitely gets the job done.
i break out really easily
with this amazing product i look forward to putting this stuff on i have combo skin dry on cheeks
that's no fun so you buy a product to dry you out in hopes of balancing
i wanted to see if this stuff really works
this stuff will most definitely be my no
this product is definitely not just for men.
the price point is so good that it works perfectly for what i wanted
it's definitely more for oilyskinned people
i never knew a men's product was so good!
you don't feel it like greesy or something
it feels so nice
this stuff is so light
my face feels like a baby's face.
this product is a feel good item for me.
i really liked this eye cream.
i did really like this product
you can really see a difference
loved how this product felt going on my skin
i also really like that its one product for the face
tighten really well for me
instantly i felt a nice cooling sensation on my face
my skin felt and looked great afterward.
i felt like my skin actually improved over the days i was using this
save myself a step when i just want a light bit of color
container is really nice too.
i really love this product
it feels all right on the skin
it really is doing very well for my skin
i know that sounds weird
for 46$ thats a great deal especially when a little goes a long way
honestly the texture is a little weird
i definitely prefer this product to the azulene gel
this felt really great on my skin.
it's actually really nice
what's so good about this one that beats all the rest?
you get the idea.
t feels weird putting it on your face
honestly a little bit will take off your whole face
feel this is a good investment
not really sure how i would feel about it
it really does take off everything.
every cleanser i've tried so far is horrible
overall, it does everything it says it does.
have always had a hard time removing my long wear foundation
this really takes off all the makeup you have on
when it was all gone i could see a huge difference in my skin
it also gives this tingling feeling which makes me suspect there is a great deal of alcohol in the product
this oil makes my face feel great upon application
this stuff is seriously amazing!!!!
i don't know i just feel brighter when i use it.
this stuff works wonders on tough to remove makeup
'm scared something might be different
i would definitely recommend for youthful skin- i am in my twenties
i really like the way my skin looks while using this product
my face was really really dry
it works wonders for me
i can also tell a difference in my skin
my skin's been really dull
make up stay nice too
it has a really fresh but really light scent.
here is the thing
i really love how great this moisturizer makes my skin look
its enough for my whole face
i really like this product
i feel really good after i put it on
i feel like i look more youthful when i use this stuff
i feel this would be an awesome light day moisturizer for my oily skin type for almost year round here
got in my play box and it's really good!
i do think it makes my skin look better.
alcohol is not always a bad thing
which feels so refreshing
i really love this formula
i really love the scent
this is a really good product that i may purchase
it feels nice going on
this stuff is so great to put on before make up application
i feel like it makes my skin look very smooth
the texture makes you want to continuously rub wherever you touched on everything else
definitely give it a try!
i do experience the matter finish
this stuff really works
asked one of the people working for help finding a good moisturizer that would help keep me matte all day
it works well for me
you think "this is too good to be true
you don't get a whole lot
this first time i used it under my bareminerals matte powder foundation i was extremely happy how flawless it made my face look
was amaze how it made my skin feel
great product, don't think i'll ever change.
it keeps my face perfect for hours honestly don't feel the need to blot
really does go on matte
thought the mattifying aspect would be a nice benefit
this really does the trick.
this is the only moisturizer i've found that keeps me matte pretty much all day
this product works really well
i get shiny pretty quickly
it's really hard for me to find a moisturizer with spf i can actually use
my makeup still looks good by the end of the day
have never had "good" skin
like i said, i need this in my life.
my skin did feel a little tight
i love how it makes my skin feel
i also find it does have a nice matte finish.
from the very first time i used it i knew i was going to love it
it's really hard to gage how awesome this product is since it's humid in hawaii right now
to me it kind of leaves the feeling of a primer on my skin
you can use on whole face
it feels like you're wearing nothing
i really like this product!
the use of dimethicone really helps, i think.
i just feel like it works for my skin best with another daily moisturizer underneath
this one really works!
it really does a great job of mattifying my skin too
i would definitely recommend.
with this product it keeps me matte pretty much all day
it makes my skin feel amazing
i feel like i use up a lot of this trying to cover my entire face
i love the way it makes my skin look.
i always get super shiny with foundation so sunscreens are always a challenge for me
i love how it feels
it feels like a moisturizer when you put it on
i want to love this so bad
think i'll be getting this whole line!
i really loved it
i really loved every drop of this
thought it might make me look too shiny
am okay with it
was worried this would make me feel stretched out
regardless of if i have makeup on or not as i feel it genuinely removes natural dirt
my face felt pretty comfortable
i loved it so much i had to order one for myself.
i put this stuff on them 2x a day
i've never had such terrible skin.
i like how the solution itself is a pretty green color
have really bad acne
when i say i've pretty much tried everything
this stuff is so so good i had a major breakout
it has a natural smell to where you know the ingredients are really good in it
this product really changed my skin.
i feel like i've tried every mask
up until i was 25 i always had really clear skin
always felt like i had to wear makeup every day
for helping me feel comfortable in my skin
i find that i wake up with my skin looking nice
really felt the need to for this product
i feel this has really helped
smell is interesting but is not a problem for me.
which i guess is pretty lucky
it's definitely getting there
this is the stuff i've been dreaming about to combat it
it has a weird smell that you have to get used to
i like it because it makes me feel like its actually working
after reading great reviews on this product i decided to guy it
while i don't really see this doing much for my pores i will definitely repurchase
i only use it when i feel like my skin is congested
i know that adding an oil has been a great addition to my routine
i just dont' have a good reaction
i actually like how it smells
this stuff really works.
i think like many people who love this
make me feel like i'm living a life of super luxury?
i really really like it
i learned that the hard way.
really wanted to love the line
i found myself one morning going to work with no face makeup
it really works too.
heard a lot of people complaining about the smell
so the breakouts were horrible
when you put this on it kind of tingles
this stuff works like a dreammmm.
my skin has cleared up tremendously
has helped really clear my acne!
the products have been a really great experience so far
i wanted to make sure it was for me
i get pretty bad breakouts
i get compliments all the time now how clear my skin looks
since i was a kid i have always had normal-oily skin
i did purge pretty bad for about a week
any breakouts i had were basically gone as well
it really works wonders.
glowing i love how it makes my skin feel
my face looks so clear now!
it has seemed to clear up my skin quite a bit
mainly it just makes my skin feel
that this oil at night is something she likes
while it definitely is not something i would use in the am
end up looking really shiny
the smell is definitely something you have to get used to
this product is everything to me.
i've even been comfortable enough to go without makeup which is a huge accomplishment for me
you all have to know how amazing this is
i would cry because it was so awful!
the smell is really not as bad as a lot of people are making it sound
i really recommend this product!
who cares when you going to have nice skin
i actually think it smells a little good
it makes my skin feel amazing
my first impression of this product was wow that smells bad
this stuff has to be made out of gods tears or something
initially this made my skin feel like it was burning
feels like your really pampering yourself
overall it feels like a really nice way to treat yourself a few times a week
i want to love this mask so desperately.
i do believe it does great things to my face
!i rub a bit on my face, really massage it in.
i think i'm going to because i love it that much
i loved how this made my skin look afterwards.
like other fresh stuff not sure it does much for my particular skin
im not sure about the negative reviews because of the tightening feeling-that means the mask is doing its job
always making me feel that i'm actually feed my skin with some real food xdit helps brighten up my face a bit
i think they are a very good product
it really hurts my heart to say this
so i am going to purchase the whole jar!yeah!!!
people who like the smell is going to love it
i love how smooth and clear this makes my face.
the thing is that hate the texture
i really don't like it
definitely recommended to my friends!
couldn't believe how smooth my skin felt
my cheeks felt exactly like my son's
it was enough for both of us
it really helps me with my combo
if this stuff is right for me
each time i notice how different my skin feels
i take care of my skin very well
my skin has been feeling tired
it brought some nice colour to my cheeks too
sometimes they have a weird consistency
i definitely recommend trying this out
it just feels like it works.
but my skin loves this!
i really love fresh
i really hoped i was not going to like this mask because the full size is 80$
my boyfriend commented that my skin looked nice
it really felt like i put fruits on my face.
my mom uses it too
sure the price tag is a bit up there
you see the difference every time.
i really love this mask.
because i've never really felt they did that much for my skin
it really does make my face look more vibrant.
you could probably just crush a bunch of fruit together
really like the br
i feel like putting the stuff in a blender ....
definitely not loving it
the smell is definitely amazzzzing
it does basically feel like jam for your face however
glides on super pretty i love it
glow with this stuff right here.
say it with me.. great stufffffff.
i think i noticed the difference after maybe using it two times
the sephora guy told me this is the solution for me
i will definitely re purchased this if i am feeling rich though
ordered it after all the compliments on how nice my skin looked
i super excited to have added this to my skin care routine especially for the winter months
since i really like the sugar
because it is really easy to get it off
which was okay with me
makes your skin look that way too
after one use i already had compliments on how pretty my skin looked
the tool with the product seemed a bit hoaky to me
my skin looked so good
feels so comforting on my skin
this moisturizer does not give me amazing results
my younger brother's skin also looked amazing as he started using my moisturizer as well
anyways, it actually minimizes the look of it.
honestly love this product!!!
i really love it.
i really do enjoy it.
i actually really like it
it makes me feel nice
it does give me some help in not looking as tired in the morning
the only thing i really don't like is the strong scent
first impression is that i love this
omly tell me i look pretty
this stuff really does do a good job at hiding dark circles because of the diamond dust
you feel good knowing it's not just hiding your dark circles
actually doing good for your skin
'm going to really stretch this sample out
love how my skin looks
usually people tell me that i look tired or ask if i'm feeling okay
it takes a little getting use to because i agree with another review that it feels like it disappears
it does really brighten my skin
it is so fun to peel off
takes all my puffyness away and i feel pretty
that is ok with me
just remember everyone skin is different so your results may be different from others
this made my face feel amazing after.
this really does brighten
my skin isn't left feeling tight after however i still need a good moisturizer after doing the mask
i still enjoy every bit of it
i've always been the type to just use foundation
i really enjoy using it
makes you look so cute when you wear it
it felt so smooth
i love peel off masks--i think they really help with acne
like some other people on here
i really liked this face mask.
when my skin feels bad it really gives me what i want plus more
it's great to use before make up because it leaves your skin feeling more prepared for the day
this mask really does what it says it will.
not to keen on the scent it smells like sake big time
it's not as pretty
it has done wonders for my face
it's really hard for me to find nice skin products that actually work
although its very nice i would not pay that price
i like it a lot
it looked pretty good afterward
it's tough to find one that does all of that together
there's something amazing about it.
if that makes sense
that stuff was way too heavy for my eyes at this point
they work really well together
my face feels so clean when i'm done
this cleanser works really well!
if that makes sense
i definitely made sure i got everything off
i still have this feeling on my skin
this weird feeling on my skin that made me doubt wether i got all the stuff off is gone
another thing i love about this is the fact that it definitely calms breakouts
my skin definitely feels more balanced
love the way this
coming from someone who really does have troubled skin
i love the way this product makes my skin feel!
i also like that it just takes a very tiny bit of product to get a very nice thick lather on my face
i really like this cleanser!
this is one of the few cleansers i have actually loved
go try it and see for yourself :)
if you do have a foreo is this a great wash for that
i really feel like it sucks all the excess oil
it can be so hard to find a great moisturizer that won't break you out when you have acne
love that it has good ingredients they kept alot of junk chemicals out
it works well for me
my face got very greasy
really works into the skin
it definitely made my face feel so clean
i love it and will definitely repurchase.
this cleanser work really well with that
really nice warming effect on face- left it feeling smooth
knew i was gonna love it
after using it all up i can say this mask is great
it does have a tingle but it feels good.
which seriously nothing ever really accomplishes this
pretty much kept up this really interesting sticky texture for the entire time
i'd say that it helped me feel cleaner
this product definitely lives up to the hype in my opinion
my combination/starting to mature skin loves this stuff
it also wipes off easily which is always nice.
i really like everything about it
it is definitely warming
the way it made my skin look and feel is amazing!
mpressed with the way it makes my skin feel after
he looks so young
it looked like i was wearing a sheer highlighter on my whole face
but i am getting off topic here.
i know that i am definitely getting the full version of this
still, it's not comfortable.
i love everything about this product from the way it feels to the way it makes my skin feel
i've always had a few bumps here
i always look forward to how great my skin will feel the next day
i love the warming feeling when you put it on
i know some people said it burned
made my skin feel softer when i was done using it
after you are finally done with the mask your skin feels totally renewed
i feel like it also has helped with my acne too.
its really just one of those products.
i wish the smell was better
let me tell you amazing
it works darn it
loved the warming feeling on my face.
i love everything about this stuff.
you can just feel it working
this mask has done wonders
make sure to do my research on a product
it's really hard to find something that doesnt make my skin have a stinging sensation
really just feels freak when you're applying it on
i really recommend this product!
at first i didn't think that it really gives me the moist
i did notice a nice change in texture of my skin.
it's warming and feels so good on my skin.
really started to think it was all a gimmick
i could really feel how warm it got on my skin
this has really helped my skin
truly start taking care of my skin
my skin has never felt so smooth
look forward to getting my h
i really like it for smoothing
you get a good amount or product.
not sure if it brightens my skin
this mask is definitely a must have for me now.
it gives me that really youthful
i like this a lot
makes my skin feel amazing.
i couldn't believe how good my skin looked
i really love this maske
what interested me was that there are no "bad-for-you" ingredients
ok so i'm 33 and have had acne my whole life.
've tried sooo many skin care products
not tight like many others made my face feel
this does really well to prevent them from coming
it did clear all the little bumps i had under my skin that just looked bad when i put foundation on
i can tell is is doing a good job of cleaning my skin
takes off makeup really well
this has really cleared my skin
i honestly see a big difference i don't really get pimples now
this product is seriously helping my scars go away it's amazing
i tried it out and it works perfectly.
i've gotten compliments from friends telling me my skin has never looked better
so make sure you have a really good moisturizer
it is a really good face-wash.
i actually really like this cleanser.
just like it claims.
as i feel like there is with any acne treatment
i felt like i had tried everything
he uses it when he feels a big one coming on
products like this work differently on everybody
this really worked for me
it really did the job
that is nothing when you think about how good it is
i love it there too
it does seem to heal any spots on my face pretty quickly
i've tried just about everything.
this worked really well for me!!!
wasn't expecting it to smell good
i really love this product a lot <3<3<3
it really does work!
i used another skin care product that broke me out really bad
i really like it
want to feel a little special
i really like this one as well
especially when my skin needs a nice pick me up in the morning
i feel like it just smears it all around my eyes
for some reason i just feel like that means it isn't really "cleansing" like it's supposed to
so you should always start with some kind of remover
i noticed that a lot of people don't like the smell
it's actually very pleasant to me
hopefully i see good results with this!
i wanted something that would foam up better with my clarisonic
i still really like it
i think i've found it.
i could definitely see the difference in my skin
it also doesnt feel greasy after application
i really like it
this stuff works so quickly.
i like to mix this with my essence
i love trying new things
that's okay still love it
definitely give this a try.
it's bring life to my face especially in the morning
my skin loves it as do i
when i feel it
whenever i use it looks like how i would look when i have slept well
the price makes me think :
it really does make your skin look glowy
the product is so good that i can definitely get past that
my foundation goes on like a dream over this product
it definitely makes a difference in the moisture level of my skin
i literally feel my skin's plumped
she knew her stuff
really liked the fragrance and performance.
honestly love this product.
its so good i just couldn't wait to let everyone how amazing it is
i really stress on that
this one is definitely a keeper!!
i am definitely going to buy more from this line
it worked very nicely it's a little greasy
this is a keeper for sure!
to me that is 3 in 1.
i feel like my skin looks brighter overall
really does remove all make-up
i absolutely love too cool for school
they really meant it
i am a big fan of too cool products.
not a great first impression that the guy in the video pronounces "jojoba" wrong
the real perk is how it makes my skin feel afterwards
it does not feel like an oil
it also works really well to take off my makeup
i do think this product keeps my skin balanced
there was enough product in here to put on my cheeks
even though it was fun at first
keeping the box to keep everything together is probably a good idea
i feel like i'm always bringing a new one home every time i shop for beauty products
my bf is just as addicted so he's always one to try them too
both of us had really good results
it does leave my skin feeling good
it feels oh so smooth
i think this mask is really amazing.
just feels very cool
it's so much fun to use
i loved how my skin looked afterwards
better part is it didn't feel like it dried my face out like most do it actually left it very soft
but the thing is, this stuff really works for me.
and my skin feels so nice and smooth afterward.
she likes a gimmick too
it's everything you could want in a mask: crazy fun to use
i take very good care of my skin
glowing it feels so good i don't want to put anything else on it
the lady did up my whole face with products i wanted to purchase
just to see how well they would work together
makes you feel like you have sooo much less makeup on
so fun to use and i saw immediate results!
fun to use and no need to wash it off.
it's really cool how well it works/takes off the product once you have had it on for 5-10 minutes
love the after feeling of this mask.
not only is it fun
it makes your skin feel amazing until you wash your face again
bring me hidratation to my skin
make sure you get educated on it
very little mess, very fun!
my face not only feels amazing
the mask was super fun too.
i totally bought this just because i thought it was cool
see if it works for you because it really worked for me
honestly if you have really dull skin
in the winter it's pretty bad
my mum asked me the next day what i used on my skin because it looked a lot better
i must say there is an element of fun to this mask
love the way it makes my skin feel.
i liked this lot.
it looked so cool that i knew i had to have it!
this mask is so fun to use!
this helps me skip that step
went in knowing about all the good
not only is it fun
plus it is as fun as a face mask can get!
not only was this fun to apply
i still loved this product
to be honest it's pretty mind blowing
so this is definitely a night time product
not only was the mask so cool it made my skin feel amazing
it worked exactly as it says and felt amazing !
however after i did all the fun application
i felt a big difference
its actually really cool
i played around with the magnet because it was super fun
put it to the side thinking it was clearly a gimmick
that the tissue they suggested would really be doing all the work
i will say that it definitely smoothed
work wonders on my skin
wow my skin was like
having always been a fan of interesting masks
it can get pretty messy if you don't.
i tried all sorts of things
i really like this.
mixing and applying is fun too.
i am telling you my skin was having a terrible day
i feel like i can face today.
makes my skin feel
this is really helping with my freckles
i really love this cleanser.
talked to me about my skin etc
she said this would help me with my skin looking dull
as i am getting older i am glad i started very young
love the feeling it leaves you with
this stuff smells sooo good
the smell is actually really nice from what i was expecting
i loved the ingredients here
it cleans really well
it did a really good job in removing most of my makeup
its got a really good smell to it too.
wanted to use a product that was good for me
have always had problem skin
in fact i'll always keep it on h
yet smells so good
she was so right
which i still love
one suggestion that i learned the hard way
i really like this stuff.
i really like it
my face felt amazing after just one use
it makes my face feel so clean
and the cleanser works really well.
i really like it.
which i also really love
they were making my skin feel scaley
this cleanser does a really nice job of leaving my face feeling clean
don't really have skin issues besides using some cleansers that make my face feel tight
my whole face feels smooth
i do feel like it gets the remainder of what is left
the scent is alright
you can definitely smell the green stuff in it!
i really like the glass packaging
i can tell my skin is starting to look brighter
my skin has never felt so good.
when i use this product i feel that my skin becomes very clean
anyways, face has been feeling clean and pretty.
skin wasnt doing very well
it still really cleans your face
getting a good cleanser is important if you where a lot of make up
keep doing your thing
i definitely would recommend this to my friends.
this product definitely shows results
i really like this line of products.
i'd definitely recommend this product
i feel like it has done wonders for my skin
it smells pretty good too
not sure how great it will be for traveling
i know i am hard to please when it comes to skin care products
makes my skin feel
makes my whole complexion feel balanced
retinoids pretty hard lately
felt little difference in my skin
together our skin looks amazing even after lots of time in the heat
i got this as a part of the mini duo just to give it the good 'ol try
sensitive skin so this cream really would not be great without the other products in my routine
after having moving to the us then having a baby my skin went really weird
it feels so light
in fact i really think it helps balance the oil production in my skin
i really decided i should start taking better care of my skin
i love the consistency of this too.
it bothers me in winter
i just love everything about this moisturizer!!!!
i don't think my skin has ever looked this good
i really recommend this product
this stuff is seriously liquid gold to me.
it gets the job done
i actually enjoy the smell quite a bit
at first the smell wasn't something i liked
now i find it refreshing
now that i've made a good dent in the container i feel like it's time to write a review
while i doubt it works for everyone
i know i needed this in my life.
i spent some time trying to find a good moisturizer
this being said, i do love this for what it is.
i really liked it
makes my skin feel nice
i do like this a lot
loved the way this moisturizer made my face feel.
i guess most "good" moisturizers are
i really am in love with the way my skin feels after using this
i felt like i was having a bad skin moment
that's when i really started seeing my skin transform
really screwed me up mentally for a bit
so our lives were pretty intertwined
this stuff just makes my face feel
luckily yttp takes care of one those thangs.
if my skin isn't feeling so "tight" as i like it too
feel it's time for the review
i really love it
works so well together
you will fall in love with the way it makes your skin feel
you will thank yourself when you see
i really like this moisturizer!
since starting this stuff my face has completely even out
this still really absorbs into your skin
on days where i'm not really going out
that's because it really does work
i like the consistency
this so far is really good for my skin
since the other products are working so well for me i really want to get it
it's really helping me calm it down not to mention i have very combination
it really calms my skin down when i use it consistently
i feel like this is a good way to keep my skin healthy
i love it so much i feel like i should stick pile it "just in case"
this stuff is no joke!
i love the feel of it and i love the ingredients!
i look good right now
a dab really goes a long way!
that's going to ring true for pretty much everyone who tries it
i loved this stuff so much
she loves it too
it feels really good to be using products from a company that doesn't test on animals
i get some pretty bad breakouts
it makes my complexion look so even
as i feel it's a little too dark for my skin
its really the only thing i aim to cover up every day
super awesome！！i really like it！it makes my skin looks pretty young
i love it as a foundation on days when i don't want to wear a lot of makeup
that being said, i love it as a foundation.
was like owell luckily sephora returns everything
however in natural lighting it looks really pretty
just looks like my skin
i realized it does this weird thing with my nose pores
this really did a nice job of covering it up without it feeling heavy at all
just keep in mind that you have to blend this out pretty quickly
honestly i felt like it minimized my pores as well
my cheeks are always quite red
have no idea why it got such good ratings 0/5.
it really just feels/looks like any mid/full coverage foundation
am not sure how this cream works on different skin tones
this product definitely does what it says it will
it works really well
it pulls everything together very well
i really do love this though nothing else has worked so well for me
yes i am super lucky that this is basically my shade
despite having pretty fair skin
to be honest i don't even need to wear it with this cream since this product is so good
i feel that when it comes to this product
a pretty freakin good one
he just thinks i am having a "good skin" day lol
it looked pretty bad
i am pretty fair
really does last all day
definitely recommend this product!
you have to prep your face like always
coworkers are always telling me that i 'look like i got a lot of sun this weekend
it give a great finish that's not too heavy
it goes on really great without using a lot.
i still can get by with just wearing it or applying foundation over it for a great smooth
it works really well
it matches really well
the only con i have is that there is a weird smell at first
before all the good stuff like foundations
my skin is very fair so it looks good.
still love this product!
before foundation to really create an even tone
it actually blends in pretty well
doesn't last all the day tough
this is the only thing i wear on my skin now because it works
at first i didnt like this product because im very fair
but when i want to look "perfect", i'll go to it.
really like the coverage
it really is an important part of my routine
it really covers redness really really well!
i really haven't found a better working product for my skin
this truly is what i've needed the whole time
'm still going with 5 stars
does pretty good though and i would recommend it.
this is definitely a product i love.
it really does help with the redness
it worked perfectly for me
which makes my skin feel like it still can breathe throughout the day
this stuff covers so well
is really light on my skin
now t is very nice
want your skin to look flawless you have to try this
you can actually feel it going deep into your skin
i love how this product goes on & feels.
i especially like i can use it for my eyes too.
can be left on as long as you don't mind the feel
i'd like to try it with my clarisonic, too.

i really recommend this product for people of any type of skin
i love the feel

this is one of their not good
my skin has been looking the best it has looked in awhile
i think this would be especially good for removing long-wearing makeup
my face also feels so good after washing with this
this one puts them all to shame
i find myself wanting to do my makeup
i would definitely recommend for all skin types.
this is definitely going to be my go to
i love the feel of this on my skin.
this stuff is awesome i used to hate taking my makeup off because i felt like i was rubbing my skin away with the makeup
this stuff makes it so easy
until i got this stuff.
it kind of reminded me of crisco
i do feel the need of a moisturizer after
it made my skin reel really nice after using
i know i've always left stuff behind
with this stuff once i massage it to my face omgoodness i love it
i get so many comments on how beautiful my skin look
makes my skin feel afterwards
just make sure to moisturize really well after using it
i wear quite a bit
applying it felt so weird
it did do a great job in removing my makeup
i think it's really important to remove all your makeup for a flawless face
i certainly found that in this one
everyone tells me my skin looks flawless !!
'i'm not a fan of a lot of it products
i am definitely going to exchange this.
i love how it feels on my skin
i really like this primer
very hard to find the perfect primer that won't break me out or dry me out
i could definitely see the difference
this primer works really well
very little it all you need.
all i can say is that it definitely works for me
and there are so many great ingredients in here.
noticed that this product really helped even out the skin color under my eyes
has really helped with the fine lines around my eyes
i feel like face cream can do the same stuff.
it just felt good to put on!
it definitely helps with dark circles
i hate it when people comment on me looking tired
this really goes the trick with my bags
i got this thinking it would be a good moisturizer for my undereyes
while i like this eye cream a lot
i wanted to use something like this as a preventitive for the under eye wrinkles
i really like it.
for me this one is it
makes my eye area look
it has done wonders
i would definitely recommend this product to anyone who has dark under eye circles
it seems for plenty of people this one is a miss
i do feel it has improved the look of my eyes
i look like a whole new person
never really noticed any difference
i am really seeing the effects of using this product
i don't really have dark circles
this cream has just the right feel
i can actually feel a difference with the hydration
this stuff actually works.
i do think it does a nice job
wow this thing really works!
i just really like this eye cream!
which have always been very bad
my eyes feel amazing
i think my eyes look smoother
it really depuffed my bags
i just loved them
seriously just so amazing.
i feel like after i started using this stuff i didn't have the dark eyes i used to have
sooo the years are starting to show around my eyes
you can actually see a good portion of my eyelid with my eyes open which is amazing
he loves it as well
i really like this eye cream!
but i feel like i notice a difference.
i feel like it's actually doing everything it claims
it works so well for me
numerous allergies it's been difficult finding a nice product i can use so glad to have found this one
i really like this product!
was able to get a good idea of the product
this has really helped
after using it i have really enjoyed the results
i can say it definitely has brightened my dark circles
i tried this because the skin under my eyes always seems to be tender
i must say i am really impressed to see that my dark circles have significantly lightened up to the point i don't feel i need to put on concealer on a daily basis
i've always had horrible dark circles
even my mom commented it on it!
i see no real difference in getting rid of my dark circles
i never do get good sleep
even so i feel like the formula is so-so.
it comes pretty close
i know everyone is different
i really love it
i really recommend it.
so far i am really loving it cosmetics bye bye under eye cream
this i cream is really the deal.
it's a really really good
i can definitely tell it's working
thought well if that's good
it makes my skin truly transform i feel comfortable not wearing makeup my skin has improved immensely
s look just as good as my face
2 sisters because it is so freaking great
it does feel like you have something on your face bc it's pretty thick
it feels so good on your skin
it makes my skin look so healthy and pretty.
my skin has honestly never looked so good
for the first time i think ever i felt like my skin actually looked too good to cover it with foundation
i also actually really like the smell of this.
you can still feel how nice
'm not sure it would work for oily skin
there really isn't a fragrance
i've never been able to find anything that has really helped my skin cracking or my burns
not greasy left my skin feeling amazing
you know that feeling you get when you're really thirsty
you feel that sense of relief?
i swear that's how my skin feels when i put this on
'm always careful about what i actually put on my face when it comes to moisturizers
it honestly reminds me of that
i never feel greasy
this stuff is so so good!
as i thought for sure it would feel too heavy for me during the day
ive even started to not wear foundation because my skin looks so great
it makes my skin look and feel great.
really hoping i don't jinx myself
not a big fan of the scent though.
let the whole day
i really enjoy the scent
and it looks soooo good under makeup!
i would definitely recommend this product.
t has always been difficult for me to find just the right moisturizer
this stuff has helped out a lot
i try a lot of products
lately i had been feeling like my moisturizer wasn't doing it's job
i really love it
i definitely prefer it confidence in a cream
this stuff feels so great on my face!
i love how this cream feels on the skin
not really deep at all
hope this helps someone out there
so happy i did- this is perfect for winter/those using harsher items
full i really love it
i can feel and see a difference 2 weeks in.
feel a difference in my skin
so far i am really enjoying this cream.
i really like the texture
how my skin looks
it feels very slick when i put it on
i really do believe it "rejuvenate
don't let anyone who says all natural is always better
love the way my skin feels in the morning
this is gonna last a good amount of time
i will definitely keep using it for good.
i can tell it is making a difference in the appearance of my skin
i really like that you can also use it on your neck
my skin loves confidence!
it really works right away
i feel that it does smooth out my wrinkle around my eyes
i really like how this calms my skin
i feel good about this lotion
sensitive skin it feels really nice
it really is changing my skin
it works really well for this purpose.
once it has sunken in it feels pretty even with the softness of the rest of my products
have tried sooo many products to help tone it down etc
so nice for night time especially
it really really calmed my skin down
i really like this product.
it really does help tone down redness
really encourage trying this if you are an acne-prone
i think that a good amount of my
after trying this product my skin is so smooth
i couldn't believe how fast it worked- just 1 try took away a lot of my dry skin
this one was so raved about for redness i had to find out myself
it's a bit too think for me to use all over my face
but everyone is different.
i honestly think it helps clear up my breakouts
it definitely helped get rid of my husb
i really like this cream
i am obviously going to have to use it for as long as it's available
this cream helped me immensely until i was able to get to the doctor for an rx ointment
im actually kinda starting to like it.
i wear this cream at night and i really love it.
this really helps to just calm everything down
it works wonders when i get a breakout
i think i've found it with this product
and it was great but a bit too oily for me.
it's been working well
nothing else had been really helping.
you know the kind
after using it for a week i think this stuff is really amazing
i think it helps my pores too!
someone else described the feeling of this as "healing
that's how it feels for me too
my face feels so smooth i just want to run my h
how this stuff has healed my face
basically my face is a mess
how you can basically use it for anything to heal
i love how it makes my skin feel
i definitely recommend this!
really lifted the stress that my acne was giving me
sorta wrote this off too
be totally good on foundation if you still felt you wanted foundation for a more made up look
actually feel good about what i am putting on my face knowing it won't clog my skin or take hard cleansers to remove
i also like the smell of the product a lot
it made me break out :/ obviously everyone's skin is different
feels like i'm wearing nothing
we dont have too put that much cause its really greasy
i just put a bit for a primer
it is pretty light
i like this a lot.
it definitely made her young skin look fresh
i shop here a lot
i am done for an easy summer look.
this is the only thing that has worked that has actually made my face look good
this has seriously changed my make up routine in that i can now wear blush because i don't have my natural red coming through my foundation anymore
sometimes i use it in replacement of foundation if i just want something really light
i really love that there is spf 30 in it
honestly, this stuff is amazing.
it really works miracles when it comes to my red patches
then just make sure you always apply a layer on top to restore your natural skin tone
i put this on totally diffuses the situation from bad to better i still put foundation over it
i am pretty much out the door
some things would work
this guy camoflauges my redness
i feel like it's very drying.
it's definitely something that needs to be washed off
i am good to go
this product really works wonders for me.
which is why i always where foundation
i actually think it helps my makeup stay put.
well it's just too amazing
it works really well to smooth out my complexion
i feel like people are actually looking at me instead of me behind a layer of product
the only reason why it got a 4 from me is that i'm still pretty dry
it definitely helps with my red complexion
at the same time has a pretty natural look to it
it was too orange for me
it really does even everything out
i especially love that i can use it on my chest which is always red for some reason
this really evens out my skin tone.
because she's always striving to use products with better ingredients i'm always keen to research
said "that stuff is magic you will love it
it's definitely all i need on the weekends which is nice
trust me, it really works!
because it really is a game-changer if you struggle with redness
i feel like it gives coverage
i still love it
this stuff is magic.
i always felt the foundation was too heavy
i honestly thought putting a green moisturizer on my face would not work out well
shout out to the guy at sephora that recommended i try the travel size
so my face is pretty much a wreck--i look like a clown
tried this sample they gave me loved it sooooo much i came back to buy the big jar
always have to wear a lot of foundation to cover it
im rating it a 4 because it can make your face look pretty dewy
it covers really well
this really helped with that as well.
my skin always feels so clean
i definitely recommend buying this!
i learned that it takes very little
i now feel and look like a new person!
my skin would always be red which is why i felt the need to wear foundation every day
i think you really get a lot for the price
it feels like i have nothing on my face
not only does it make my skin look great
has spf making me feel better about going out for a day in the sun
this product really does work!
as well as something of a greasy feel when you wash it off
feel in love with it
it will definitely do the job
for me that just feels like moisture
i got this as a 100 perk
so far i think it's adding a nice step into my evening routine
i truly feel like it removed makeup
it also makes my face feel greasy but works
it does make me feel greasy when i first put it on lol
i really loved this.
i felt like it really took off all my make up
got this as a reward and i love it!
not really get anything off
'm careful about what i put on my face
i really really love that you can use it on your eyes because i am lazzzzy
i saw a few not-so-great ones for this cleanser
wanted to throw my experience out there
at the end it makes me face feel so smooth
it will feel greasy at first
just be sure to really rub it in before washing it off
i love the way my face looks afterwards.
i would definitely recommend this product!
i'll definitely think of purchasing this product!
plus this does the job of a cleanser as well so your really getting two products for the price of one
i like the consistency of it.
i like how it smells.
i really like the way it felt on my face after
it never seemed to get the job done
but it really does work!
i wasnt really sure it actually removed everything
this stuff feels great after i use it
i think this product is really good
too much works, huh?
i personally recommend that just in case you wear a heavy make up
i always have a hard time to remove my waterproof makeup with this one everything really melted
it really worked for me
it really does take off everything including water proof makeup
i definitely recommend this.
my skin feels amazing either way after using
i really am enjoying using this cleanser.
my face felt really smooth right after
this stuff does a really great job of removing all traces of makeup
this stuff takes my make up off no problem love it
i really like the smell
i love how easily it takes off everything
this stuff works really well.
this stuff gets off every last bit of my makeup.
i really love it
my skin is really looking good
leave a weird film on my skin
it really does take all your make up off
i really think it's been helping with my acne
knew i'd like this one
even using my mia my face never felt truly clean.
it was a wow moment for me.
really does melt off everything
it makes my skin look so nice after i use it too.
it actually helped balance my skin
i while skin products don't work for everybody i do recommend this product to everybody battling with dry spots
definitely notice a difference with it
also really great for right after a peel or acne masks that really dry me out
see what you think
i really love this!
i feel like this works better for me
i loved how it felt on my skin
the difference this has made right at that time of the year when your skin starts getting yucky from sleeping with the heat running all night is just incredible
i personally like the smell it is a little strong
this is just so amazing i have to
i don't mind the smell it's actually quite nice
that is a bummer for me as i really loved this cream
love how it feels
i would definitely buy this
thinking another greasy cream doing nothing
and by really works, i mean really works.
this feels how it looks that's the only difference
i don't know if i'll repurchase it because i have a routine i like that gives me great results for a little less money
something tells me i will miss it.
it really does everything it says in the description
this felt good on my face.
i think some may have been expecting that smell instead of this wonderfully natural smell
as we get older i think we can all do with maintaining the density of our skin too
i really like this cream.
you don't really need a lot.
i've really seen a difference on my face at the end of the day
i encourage everyone to just seriously feel it!
plus it's obviously very anti-aging which is great since i am now in my thirties
never have i felt a cream so light
i've tried them all trying to find one that made my skin look amazing
just enough to make you feel like it will keep you hydrated
it feels so good on the skin
i like how light it is.
the neatest thing i like about this moisturizer is i can actually feel it absorbing into my skin
wold highly recc as not only is it nice
i really like this it's a great product i would recommend it
lxmi is doing something different
you need very little to do your whole face
when i wake up- it's like a whole new me
i really like the way it feels on the skin
t worked really good for me
the smell kinda reminds me of my childhood.
i felt like my skin was more glowy
it's so weird that it just came to me by chance.
i continue to get so many compliments on my skin
my skin has never looked or felt better!
sadly this is something that's out of my price range so unless this lil guy goes on sail he'll always be a memory to me
it always irritates me reading people knock a product based off of its smell
i could feel the product on my skin
this product made my whole face balanced
i don't agree- it just smells very natural
best of all it makes my skin so dewy under my makeup which is important especially in the colder months
this is the first product i've used where i can really see a difference in them
leaves me with a 'dewy' look
it makes a huge difference on how my makeup goes on
i've never had a moisturizer feel like this.
my skin has never felt so good
i honestly look forward to putting it on every day
i feel it on my skin all day
my skin is pretty clear for me right now
i seriously am in love with this balm/oil/whatever it wants to be
although i loved how light it was
still want something that improves my skin tone
it makes me feel like i'm doing good for my skin
they aren't my favorite because they make me feel greasy
feels so good going on
for sure recommend this for everyone.
six month in it definitely feels like it makes a difference to how 'fresh-faced' i look
i liked their ethics so figured i'd try their products
most of them are just ok.
and that packaging is just so pretty!
don't feel like the effects are gone in 10 minutes
feel good about supporting this company
i love that things like water
this stuff has been a lifesaver around my eyes
i literally can't begin to express how amazing this stuff makes my skin feel
it goes everywhere with me.
you can feel a little tingle when you put it on
to me it feels like the magiccnof this tube is working
everyone needs to know it
thinking there was no way in he
oddly i thought my fine lines would improve if anything
this stuff is magic!
am starting to develop fine lines under my eyes that really started to bother me
and i must say...this stuff is amazing!
this really makes a difference in the firmness
the only thing that works for me.
it's the best stuff out there.
it also just feels really nice.
i think the moisturizer works really well
you can definitely still feel this stuff on your skin after applying it
my lips have never felt better
you can feel the product working with step one.
still do need to learn is
used to the smell because i want my skin to continue to look this good
plus it is really lifting.
to me it just shows that there is no fragrance used
if i am going to put something on my face for 5-7 hours while i sleep i really need it work
feel like i am at age when i need products to deliver
this stuff is so nice
is making my skin crazy
if i could i totally would because it smells really good
then would start to make the skin look very dull
which i actually like cause it has this very natural smell
my skin has been even and looking great.
now i'm gonna have to buy the big bottle because this stuff is liquid gold
this cleanser actually worked pretty well
it can break down some pretty intense eyemakeup
i do feel like i need this product off my face asap
it really does take off all my makeup
it feels so good!!!
it does the job perfectly.
you only need one pump for your whole face
i think this is it
it was not very good at eye makeup
it makes my face feel so smooth
luckily i'm beauty savvy enough to pick up on this change
i really liked it
at first i wasn't sure i liked it.
after using it for over a week what i have really noticed is how great my skin feels under my make up
it didn't make my skin feel tight which is the best
definitely glad i picked this up.
it only took me 24 out of the 25 years of my life to find out that i actually have really dry skin
i always use this to prep my skin before a night out
i absolutely love that i can see these impurities because it gives me a gauge on how my skin is doing
my face felt nice
really helping out the big
definitely a keeper for me.
think to myself "well i'm going to have to buy this mask for $100 a bottle now"
also love that stuff
this left my skin feeling so good
bought this on the first night i couldn't really tell it did much to my skin i would say the product definitely has a little bit of a learning curve for the makeup remover you have to truly massage this product in to the face to fully have your makeup removed
it really does work well
i couldn't thank her more ☺️ now my face feels
especially my gosh darn mascara
i also had quite a bit of texture around my nose
i love how they feel, smell, and work.
i wanted to try both of these products so this was a great way to do that
it gets the job done well
this stuff is so gentle
makes my skin feel amazing
i really loved these products.
here is why:i think this product would be great for some
it is really a cool product
gentle is the name of the game here
frankly a little *too* gentile for my particular needs
it does make my skin look nice!
i really like this set i really wanted to try the oil
this little guy has a ton of product
my skin has never felt or looked this good.
am always on the hunt for something that will give me a healthy
which is always a plus
this really has helped my skin improve over time
if anything i feel like it helps any issues
for you young ladies out there
smells great and doesn't feel too greasy.
not easy for me to find a moisturizer that i love
gosh do i love this one
still wanted to load my skin with moisture this stuff was the ticket
i feel my skin gets better each time i switch to a new product
i feel my makeup applies a lot better with this as the base
i definitely feel my skin is smoother
samples are just a great way to try before i buy.
i feel like this helps seal it in to work better
i can still feel the lotion on my face as if i had just put it on
stick to this one for the whole family
this stuff has worked wonders for me
i wouldn't definitely give this a shot
once it does your skin feels amazing
feel good using it
the two together are truly a match made in heaven
overall, really loving this stuff!
it feels really light
i really like this product!
i really love it
that feels good to apply
i definitely see improvement in my skin tone
i love how it feels on my skin
with enough moisture to make my skin feel great
so the stuff is the bomb
i truly see a difference in fine lines
always have lots of compliments
love the fact that this moisturiser can be felt on the skin
without a doubt get ask what i'm using everytime as it feels so good on the skin
i love the way this smells too.
nothing was working so when i got this sample from sephora i thought mine as well try it
it definitely feels more of a gel in my opinion
this is so good at removing stuff
my skin has been so soft since i started using this stuff
this feels so good that it keeps me inspired to commit
my skincare products i had been using also left my skin pretty clear so there wasn't a lot of work that needed to be done
figure out what i was doing different
i do feel like it got my face very clean
i really liked this travel set.
i also really liked the packaging.
my skin has never looked nor felt better!
i definitely enjoyed the whole 2 step
i really liked the way this really gets down to the nitty gritty
it really gets rid of everything
i know thats a given however when i would get just a little in my mouth it was a very strong nasty taste that would take a while to wash it out
i really enjoy this cleansing set
i really liked this product.
i think my skin looks brighter
which is always a plus
i honestly think this cleansing duo has deeply cleaned
i think this is good as a travel kind of set
definitely not a 'you need this!'
whenever i wear this people comment on how great my skin is
it was definitely a little weird to use black bar soap
i definitely messed up
it would be nice every now
i think the product cleans the face very well
i felt like you need a good moisturizer afterwards to make up for the squeakyness
i think it works pretty well
i really enjoyed it being that it left my skin nice
it feel great on my skin
think the combo works well for my skin type
i definitely feel like this would be a big hitter in the winter time
my skin honestly felt like it could breathe!
my skin has never looked or felt better
i overall really like this duo!
it took of all my makeup really well
i like this part.
so using a 2-step regimen was a bit different for me
i also feel like it really exfoliates because you use the bar directly on your face
which for me i also found really fun
i really feel like the bar is what does the most
i really like this product
i think it is a fun
i feel my face has no oils left on it
the combination of these two products has definitely made my skin feel softer
it definitely makes my skin feel clean
i really feel like my skin has a great base before i apply makeup
i would definitely buy this.
i will be buying this after i run out because it makes my face feel really great
i love how clean my face feels after i use it!
i love how my skin felt after i used this product
i am really loving this set.
i really enjoysed rying this product it made my face feel really clean
this is really helping to calm my skin when nothing else did
i love the way my skin felt after using
the formula it really loves on my skin
i feel like it's more fun
when i got this i was kinda nervous to try it out because of my dry skin
other than that it was very good definitely would recommend
i left my skin feeling really fresh
not so good to my liking
like the way they make my skin feel
but really like the products!
the two step system really makes my skin feel clean
the first step does a great job getting off my makeup
i most definitely recommend trying whatever products first your skin type
definitely removes all my makeup
it has help my face clear up tremendously.
i would definitely recommend this product!
it makes my face feel really clean
would definitely recommend this product!
i would definitely recommend this for those who have oily skin like me
i really have enjoyed this product!
unfortunately i have bad skin that dosnt like to be pretty from good products
it did however remove my makeup quite nicely
it definitely isn’t going to replace any of my holy grail products
i’ll have to use it more to really see if it is doing anything for that
kinda like a mask for about 2-3 minutes
i know what my skin likes
initially you feel like you skin is very clean
i also really like the idea of two ingredients working together on your skin
bar leave your skin feeling really good
it really helped to brighten
my face does feel really clean
i think it's awesome because if you've ever had a charcoal based bar soap you know that stuff gets everywhere
i really like how this left my skin feeling
this did a good job of making my face feel very clean without overdrying
anything that worked for audrey hepburn has got to be pretty lush
i definitely enjoy the feel of these products
it's very old school, but certainly effective.
i never really expect it to improve my skin quality
i just wish it worked better in my eye makeup
i just wish it worked better in my eye makeup
it has done such a great job of getting rid of them
now how did it work, i really loved it!
i remember why i loved it so much
i did notice my skin feeling a little tight afterwards
i did enjoy how clean my skin got.
it makes me feel very clean after which i do enjoy
i really really like this product.
i really didn't like the idea of putting oil on my face
i actually really enjoyed it
it burns really bad.
do what i need to do i wasn't the least bit annoyed that i had to use 2 products because my skin felt so great afterwards
like others have stated i don't feel to good about the soap bar being rubbed on my face
felt like rubbing a bar of soap afterwards was not going to do much
i am not sure if it is good for healing acne
overall i really like it
i actually really like this duo
i really liked the oil on my skin, felt great.
i really liked this cleanse.
works really well with the soap bar
i would definitely recommend it to friends/family
my face hasn't felt this great in a really long time
all in all i really enjoy this set.
i think this would be a great gift for someone who wears makeup on a daily basis
at first i wasn't quite sure about the product.
the oil freaked me out a bit
i definitely recommend this product
it helps me feel that my skin is getting truly clean
i loved the whole experience
upon trying the product i really liked the oil to remove my eye makeup
i really enjoy the smell
i really liked this
i really enjoyed the way this cleanser left my skin feeling
i will say that i could definitely see myself using it in rotation or in dryer months for an extra bit of glow
this takes the guess work out of finding the right combo
i've realized that they are great
i love the way my skin feels with this product
it feels amazing when you put it on your skin
in that sense, i love it.
... i would definitely recommend it.
i really like this cleanser.
i can already feel a positive difference in the way my skin feels
the rest of my face feel balanced
... would definitely recommend it.
my skin has not felt this good in a while
it has definitely grown on me
watch your face go wow with this product
this product makes me want to get better at it
it did a really good job of cleaning my skin
i don't feel that it does a very thorough job as my second cleanse
i would definitely recommend this one
this product not only makes you feel clean
which i really hate
i really like this product i feel like it has worked really good for my dry skin
i like that the soap feels like it lathers really nice
this is right in between so that's so nice
this is definitely a product i would recommend
i really love this product so much!
adding this duo into my night time skin routine has really helped to make a difference
leaves your skin feeling very good
t's hard for me to find products like this
out of all honestly i love this product!
it's been really hard trying to find a product that would help with my combination skin
i am definitely going to continue to use it
i gotta say i'm in love this is my honest opinion it left my skin feeling clean
the soap made my face feel so light
is not dull looking at all
i think soap is one of those products that people don't put a lot of thought into
it has done wonders for my skin
i really do like this product.
perfect for travel like everyone else said.
8 actually got in on a.voxbox and it works great.
made my skin feel a little relief
i definitely reccomend this!
i really like how the product performs
i definitely recommend this product!
even when my skin is normal it felt sooo good when i used it
it really removes every bit of my eye makeup
however after using this i didn't feel that immediate urge because it left my skin feeling quite hydrated
other than that i think it was really good
i really like the feel
i feel it does not take off all of my makeup as well as other products
it has done a lot in my face
i also liked it because everything that followed
i find it hard to find things that don't burn my skin
it really is kind to your skin
it's not that big of a deal because i always follow up with a moisturizer
since everything seems to make my eyes water
really liked this product
this was actually really nice!!
i felt like the only thing that was awkward was actually putting the bar to my face
i really love this product
i really like this system
i still prefer a cleanser that can remove all make up because i need something that saves me time
and i have to say i really love it!
it's definitely a different concept than i've used before
great things to say about it
it's weird to be traveling around with a "bar
definitely recommend these products to you
i feel that the bar of soap will last for a very long time
trying out new face products always makes me kind of nervous
it's a pretty big hole
it really helps me with that
as i did not feel comfortable with rubbing oil on my eyes
i love how this product makes my skin feel
it felt really nice.
i loved it so much i had my mom try it
i really love this travel set.
i really liked this product it left my skin really soft
so there is the right one for all skin types
love the duo works so beautiful on my skin i really like it
this product makes me face so smooth
cleansing bar work really well together
so, that makes it not as pretty.
i really like this set.
this worked very well for me
i really like this product.
my skin has never looked or felt better.
watch your face go wow with this product
it's very interesting and i love it!
it makes my skin feel really good and clean.
other than that i really do love these two products together
feel as though the combination of the oil
it's definitely going to become a beauty staple for me
although my skin has always looked fine
these two products work sooooo well together
it's actually fun to use them together
i never really used a cleanser
i really enjoy using the cleansing oil
i really enjoyed this one from erno laszlo
i want to start out with wow!
i feel like these products must be used together to really see the benefits
i can definitely feel it
t's definitely hard to find a good cleanser
i would say that this product works pretty well in conjunction with one another
well maybe since it's a very nice travel set
comes in a hard case
it really does get all of your makeup off!
it honestly removed all of my makeup
i recently have been having really sensitive skin no matter what i try i breakout from it
that being said, i do like the product!
i liked this soothing feeling oil gives you after using it
paired with soap for "clean feel" i think it's just great
for me it was really gentle
leaves me skin feeling good not like if i have a ton of products still on it
places i really like so more people will want to try it
this is the only mask i've found that really helps
very much enjoy the smell of this
it looks a little weird
even told me i look younger
i gave it 4 starts because the smell isn't exactly pleasant
it works really well
would definitely recommend it
you actually do get a good amount of product
my eyes feel very much alive in a matter of minutes
really looked instantly brighter
you get a lot of product
no wonder this is always sold out!
i now feel comfortable to run err
this one really takes the gold
you really don't need to use a lot
i would definitely recommend it to a friend)
i really wanted something without all the parabens
if your like me
it does not foam but for me thats helpful
can trust that all it is doing is helping my skin
making my face feel really clean
i like the dropper so that i always get the same amount i want
i can really see a difference in the tone
i just really love belif products in general.
'm still getting used to this
i know it's good
it feels really good
really really sticky though so be prepared.
not the whole face or body
this stuff is just that good
don't think it is great to use during the day as a h
i actually quite like out
it feel pretty oily at first
had no idea how great it would be
got this as my 100 point perk
i'll get right to it: this product has been like a miracle for my skin
unfortunately that took me awhile to do
i also love the feel
i'll definitely keep purchasing it.
this stuff is good for everything.
i imagine it's just as amazing on the skin
it feels so good to have a moisturizer that works so well after being scared to put anything new on my face
you have to rub it into your skin very well
i think this would be great to do at night!!
and 2) i really like this stuff.
yet this stuff seems to be clearing my skin quite well
i like this stuff!
figured it would be nice for my h
this stuff is like the holy grail to me because of that
nothing else i've tried worked this well.
this stuff works wonders
this is the only thing that truly helps.
i love everything i've tried from them
it is a bit greasy but my lips, felt happier.
out one of a kind product that really deserves recognition
concentrate it mainly on the high points of your face it looks very pretty after applying you're foundation
that would make the makeup around my nose look terrible
it would also get really sore
i honestly love that feeling
something i had never felt having dry skin my entire life
this stuff really plumps up your face too
once you feel how nice your face feels
things that i find myself constantly conscious of
would be very flattering on the shoulders or legs also
especially for big events where you want to really glow
so thank you for that
just because i like it
i think this is helping
my skin just feels so refreshing.
i never feel any different after using masks
i really did with this one
i actually exclaimed "whoaaa" when i felt my face
i think a lot of people don't like this product because of the smell
i actually really love this product
personally, i love this stuff.
i would definitely recommend wearing it under foundation
i also feel like this is easy to over use
every time i have had this on my skin i am always told that my skin looks really fresh
very surprised it how much of a glow this gives your face
i love using it with a very bronze summer look.
not a good look at all.
means that hopefully my natural looking highlight will stay in place for a really long time
i can really just use normal highlighter in the place of this
definitely makes me feel like i look my best
this felt light going on
my skin looked so good
like pretty much everyone else has stated
not "disco ball" as some have said
it honestly just gives you a nice glow
anyhow it's really pretty
maybe it depends on the skin tone?
i love the highlighting aspect as it did not make my face look greasy
i honesty like this for everyday work wear .
it definitely does that without making my skin feel oily
it made me giggle no matter how awful those movies are
it's actually a pretty good product
feel comfortable wearing in public
i do think it would look fine on any skin tone
i see a lot of people saying how glittery is
i really like this product
it makes me look just a little bit dewy
i love all things highlight
definitely not to be used all over like a lotion
i instantly see the difference-- i literally just got this
i really like this.
the only reason i did not give five stars is because i felt it i was a little too old to have my whole face glittery
feels like it primes my face
i am ok with this it isn't the best for sure
i really like this moisturizer
it makes my face look like i am actually alive
it made my face feel so good
this stuff does such a great job at brightening that it looks a little silly right after washing my face because my eyes are so bright compared to the rest of my skin
he said it's great under makeup and it is!
i really liked how silky this made my skin feel
i would definitely recommend this product
like i said i love it for before my eye makeup as well
i'd definitely recommend this product!
i imagine it would be great for others
i definitely recommend this eye cream!!
i love that it makes me look less tired!
i really liked using this eye cream.
it felt smooth but not greasy at all.
it felt like a primer.
it felt smooth but not greasy at all.
it felt like a primer.
i really liked the texture of the eye balm
the way it made my skin feel after application
i really love this.
it goes on so smoothly it definitely helps how it looks under my eyes
if there's one thing i know is that the formula in vissionaire does wonders so when i got the chance to try this new eye cream sent complimentary from influenster i was super excited
for my mom too
my eyes always look so tired
i definitely would recommend this product to help make someone less tired
i really like the feel of this eye balm.
my eyes always show how tired i am
i would definitely recommend this product to anyone in need of a great eye cream that moisturizes without a greasy look
i really love this cream.
i really enjoyed using this on days without makeup to help brighten
this stuff feels really great on
i feel like it fills in the fine lines
i really like it.
i really liked the results i received from it
i really like how light this product is
this product definitely makes a difference
it felt nice under the lids
luckily i don't need a lot for my eyes
i always feel like i have dryness underneath my eyes
felt nice but i didn't see a difference.
i really like this product.
so far it's pretty good with puffiness
i want to recommend this to everybody who has dry
not sure if it really firms plumps or brightens
you will love this stuff
it just seems like a st
i dont know if it really firmed my face
it felt sooooo good to put it back on my skin
absolutely love it i can actually feel the tightness on my skin
the way it makes my skin feel
good bye laugh lines.
in the morning my face looked so good
seeing it's results makes me look forward to using it morning
this is a very effective cream that sucks in your face really like a corset would
at first i really just loved how soft my face was after using it
that's when it really started to make me think i should consider purchasing it
i really love this under my eyes
it works for me!
i love this stuff so much.
i decided to give wrinkle warrior a shot after trying other products that did nothing for me
i hope it works as well for you
really like the way this smoothed out my skin
i really like this product.
it's the same feel
there is something comforting about it
nothing has helped them relax
i know it smells
this stuff did a lot of brightening in 5 days
the smell is definitely something that you get used to
makes your skin feel better on application
am getting amazing results with each use
so after i have acne i get pretty bad dark spots
i feel like it really brightens the sun damage i am trying to eradicate
i love the way my skin looks
really see a difference already
i really liked it.
i would definitely recommend it.
i imagine if i had wrinkles it would definitely fill them out
i love everything about it.
it's usually hard for a super dry gal to find something to get excited about on here
i really love it
haven't found anything quite like it
the feel of it under foundation
i really like this!
it feels really good on my skin
however it is really good
i don't really like first aid beauty products
smells so good too.
although i always wear full makeup
i think this may be the best primer that i have ever used it works really well as my moisturizer as well as evening out my skin tone
this stuff is what dreams are made of!
i want to look like i have great skin
i think it works well
i do think it sits nicely under my makeup
suppose it's doing a good job of priming
which i think helps even out my skin
i felt great just wearing this out
you guys have to try this one if you really like coconut because it was so little in terms of the smell
that's okay because i'm more interested in how the product works
not only does it smell nice
i love the way this makes my skin look without foundation on
i love the way it leaves my skin looking when i wear it by itself
i feel like it comes off white strikes on me i have to rub it in a lot to make it work
i feel like i can wear this anytime.
my skin looks so good
i think it's a great price for the amount that you get
it is just good enough
i swear every time i wear this without makeup everyone either asks me what my skin care regimen is or tells me that my skin is amazing
it definitely helps my issue
this product is definitely not for everyone
my skin feels and looks great once it's on!
i think this makes a really smooth
i think it's pretty good
i got this because i wanted something that was nice on my extremely sensitive skin
even ones that i don't like or have looked bad in the past look great on top of this primer
i feel it does lighten the tone of foundation so keep that in mind
definitely check it out.
as a primer it works really well .
this is definitely it
i love the way this feels on my skin smooth
it definitely does feel like more of a moisturizer
i felt like i was never going to get the look i see on others
it kind of just smells like nothing to me
it's a pretty big tube
it's sooo smooth going on the skin it feels really nice
it does feel really nice
this is definitely a must have!
my skin seems to be really enjoying this product
it's always been a struggle finding something that will work with both
i also like something a little glowy
i personally like the smell
i really enjoy this stuff.
it was the kind where i tried literally everything
definitely recommend the charcoal one.
i do really enjoy this product for light makeup days
has really helped with oil
i loved it right on the spot.
definitely feel the need to rinse after using
if you're a fan of micellar waters i would definitely give this one a go
'm still going to use it
i got this because i wanted to try "micellar water"
i really like it
it smells really nice too
it makes my skin look so good
it seems to really be helping the redness i have in my cheeks
it saves me a lot of time
makes skin feel so nice
really evens skin which i thought was a hoax tbh
it makes my skin feels so great i don't even care
don't feel right after or like i need to add moisture which is nice because my skin does not need more oil than it already makes
this little guy will be staying in my routine
i really like this
i love this so much i want a huge bottle option!
left my face feeling really nice
'm always a little shy when trying new things
it did not leave my skin feeling tight
it did the job very nicely
otherwise i really loved it!
i still felt like there was residue
makes my skin feel so nice
it really makes my skin feel clean
makes your skin feel great after
make it feel tight
i find these products work pretty good
i really love everything about this except i wish it came in a bigger size
they take off makeup really well
don't go too hard on my skin
it has done wonders for my acne
other than that i love this stuff
i really like this product
maybe just when i have really dry patches lol
liked it just as well as philsophy
i definitely want to try the charcoal one too!
definitely recommend getting it.
after one use i can definitely feel a difference
good stuff right here!
i really like it
i love the way it felt on my skin and the scent.
someone even complimented my skin
maybe this product works wonders on fine lines
it felt sooooo lovely on my skin that i'd definitely consider re-buy someday
thought i'd give this little love a shot
(and i always wear foundation!)
this made sense now!
as it is a pretty penny
my dermatologist told me that we tried everything she had possible
you could tell that the primer aspect of dreamskin made the makeup look smoother
when the rep at sephora told me that this was a primer my first reaction was that's a really expensive primer
i think i need this in my life yesterday!
it really makes a difference
i don't think younger women need it.
i've never had a moisturizer do such an amazing job
she only told me this is kind of a primer-ish thing
it does not leave a tight feeling.
i would definitely recommend this
got talking with some of the lovely ladies about my skin issues
this product has done wonders for me!
i loved when a product works right away that you can feel it
it goes on nice, i wasn't sure how much to use.
t's always a bonus if i can find something that makes me look flawless
i mean i look great!
it really does work.
my skin is always red
my skin was definitely calmed
this stuff is really a life saver.
it was really uncomfortable
after i use this, i really can see difference.
i get really red
try this- i think it's very healing.
the whole idea of this mask has been very exciting for me especially as a girl who suffers through many unexplained reactions
now my face is pretty normal
definitely going into my medicine cabinet!
my skin has never looked or felt better.
this works wonders for me
your skin will feel amazing
i really want to thank the employee at sephora!
she really knew her stuff
i always go see her every time i need help
peels if i go even one day without a really good moisturizer
i still enjoy it
i appreciate that because i feel that my makeup will stick to my face
i always have a hard time finding a moisturizer
i spend my time seeing which ones had good reviews
what i needed for my skin
my makeup still looks really good at the end of the day
plus, i really like the smell.
less makeup because my skin tone is really evening out
my skin has never looked or felt better
it has definitely contri
this primer makes my make up sit so beautifully.
my face always feels so smooth
i know a lot of people weren't too keen on the smell
i could feel my skin thanking me
i literally feel as if it makes my skin happy.
i feel like this helps so much
and it feels and smells sooo good !
well i do in fact love it
it does not feel heavy at all
i really love this!
i deal with it because this helps my skin a lot
you feel the difference instantly
all they have done was give me acne
feel it gave my skin
i actually really like this.
it definitely tightens nice without it being annoying
my skin looked so nice
you do get quite a bit for the price
i always use oil at night
this one was actually really nice on my face
definitely like how it makes my face feel
this really helped even my skin tone
it makes my skin feel amazing
my eyebrow lady asked me if i have been doing something to my skin because it looked way better than last time
i gave it 4/5 because i really loved it when i had it
i really liked this product.
i love how it makes my skin feel i'm so sad i used mine all up
this stuff has seriously saved my skin
used it at night and it really did help!
seems like quite a challenge
you don't need a whole lot
my skin is sooo good now
i love this... it's really good!
i actually really enjoy this moisturizer
this is the only thing i've found that helps
i really haven't found a moisturizer that i loved
this has a little bit of a weird smell
it feels so light
this cream works really well
not only does this feel nice gliding on the skin
it's really great for me in the morning because
i liked it a lot.
i am not sure how well it will work on wrinkles
i would definitely recommend this
how it literally looks
i instantly felt a difference.
the texture is like nothing i've ever felt.
my skin has never looked this smooth
this cream worked really well for me
it works wonders on my skin!
feels like nothing's on your skin
there are a lot of good ones
this gives me just enough
it feels so nice
this would be really soothing
i honestly can believe how soft my skin felt
i feel it did a great job nonetheless
i really love it.
got this in my play box so glad i did i love this stuff makes my skin look so good
my skin looks great in the morning might buy the fullsize not sure cuz the price tag
i like this product a lot!
makes me feel like i'm getting my face really clean
i wanted a new moisturizer because the one i was using i was told was actually worse for my skin
i actually really like it but wish it had spf.
this works well and i like it.
imo not quite as good
love it makes my skin feel really smooth
i like the way this product feels
i do like that it's very light
my boyfriend couldn't believe how smooth my face felt
i really love this product.
have never found a foundation that i'm comfortable with because i don't like seeing it on top of my skin
i am always on the look for spf that is "easy
love to wear it to the gym as well to give my skin a little color-
this stick is definitely coming with me
i would think for those with fair skinned this wouldn't work as well
i really liked the formula
i really like it
but lately everything seems to break me out.
this is everything for me
it did not make my face feel greasy at all
it definitely evens out my skin
you really only need the one pump
especially when i'm about to take pictures with friends
id feel terrible if great product like this were not shared by my fellow glamours'
it works really well
i keep my look fairly natural so this isn't a huge setback for me
i feel like this product definitely deserves one
this is the only thing that keeps me looking matte all day
it's just now starting to feel a little dried out
the only reason why i took off one star is because the pad it comes with looks really gross because it gets makeup on it
i didn't feel like it worked as well as when i use it just after i've applied my makeup
my skin is pretty normal
i don't know how this works so amazingly
if you are someone who has very oily skin this will probably be a great option to mattify your skin
'm constantly running around which
you will love this product if you want your skin to look like it has life in it
it really helped me go on with a long day at work without feeling miserable
i feel like packaging could be a bit nicer
it really does what it says only need to touch up once or maybe twice if the day was pretty rough
i love the way this feels!
always take some makeup with it
that was literally the only thing i was worried about
thank you murad for making this!
so maybe that's why i had such a good result
working all day with a greasy face was not the look i wanted
so of course when i saw that this product mattified your make-up i did not really truely believe it was going to be as great as it was
it is not $40 dollar good.2.
i try not to wear makeup everyday to avoid my skin getting too clogged so this is what i've been dreaming of
this product really works
which is hard to do
i also don't feel like my skin is losing moisture
it was seriously like magic.
i would definitely recommend this.
gotta say i really love it
it is my go to product as a mom!!!
i wanted a product that would give me moisture
to me, it's a really great travel option.
i really like this moisturizer!
this does protect my skin so well
liked my skin when using it
leaves it feeling really smooth
i am really enjoying this eye cream.
it worked really well
now i am in love with the eye cream as well
it was really annoying.
this has really helped keep my skin clear!
however i do think it is a good daily cleanser
i really love this face wash!
i think it smells just fine
my skin is normally pretty clear so this was terrifying for me
knew it was some sort of congestion issue
thank you origins for helping me fix my face!!
it is definitely not what i was expecting.
this is such a cool product that really works
i've always loved the checks
was pretty excited to see they made this cool powder cleanser too
i've always loved how the mask makes my pores super tiny
it does feel nice
i really wanted to find a good one
you get two ounces of product of which you need such a small amount for it will definitely last quite awhile
really recommend it to everybody!
my skin really is brighter
cant believe how smooth my skin feels after
am definitely gonna repurchase
it's made my skin look so amazing
i just can stress enough how good this has made my skin look
i think this is it
good when i use it-- my skin just feels good
i really love this product
makes my skin feel
it makes my face feel so clean
if i feel a breakout coming
with the high price tag i kept putting it off one of the guys in sephora was telling me how when he tried it he couldnt believe how good his skin looked
always wanting to find something thats going to make my skin look great being in my early 30's now ive been trying to invest more in my skin lately i loved this product it made my skin so soft
it will always be part of my skin care routine
i am pretty young
'm like ok i'll try it
not even a month in my skin was just beautiful.
my skin has never been this good
all of them have done wonders for my skin
as i was doing so
i love the way my skin feels after i use this.
i think it's important to keep in mind that this product does tell you that breakouts as you start to use it are normal
i really love this product.
this works pretty well to smooth out my skin
have been getting compliments on how nice my skin looks
it really stings when first applied
my skin has never looked or felt better
something that you can literally see amazing results from this is it
definitely tingled putting it on
that i actually thought was refreshing
my face felt so amazingly even
it definitely brightens my face
after that i don't feel it
bha so after seeing the ingredients i just thought it would give me the same effect as what i was getting from my other products
looked like a really really bad sunburn
because of that i have really bad scarring
i definitely saw a change in my skin
not an unbearable feel though
leaving me amazed at how much it lives up to it's name
have really enjoyed everything so far
which is really something let me tell you
i really had no idea what i was getting into.
let me tell you, it is so good.
my skin hasn't looked this nice in almost a year.
what i really notice now
is that really my nose??
taking the time to really read up on what products are beneficial for my skin
your face feels like nothing special
just kind of feels normal
how my face feels
this is definitely not an 'instant' skin fix.
have seen my skin do things i never thought it was capable of
not so good that i had to go out
i got so many compliments on my skin!
so this is basically my goodbye letter to all my money
it's been nice having you
i can actually feel
i also got a lot of compliments on my skin now
but this it really deliveree results!
i love pretty much all drunk elephant including this one
this mask works really well for me
love the way it feels!
love the way my skin feels and looks afterward.
i got this as a sample and i mean, you guys.
everyone gave me compliments
so far i'm in love <3 definitely a product i'd recommend to anyone
this stuff really works.
all of these products sure do work
for people like us
one little thing can completely screw up a clear streak you have going
i will definitely be recommending it to all my friends
give you a nice clean feel.
i want to use this daily because of how amazing it makes my skin feel which in return gives my makeup a better appearance of being flawless
feels really good on the skin
i like this cream a lot
the only downfall is that i seem to have used this up pretty quick
i can definitely notice a different throughout the day
i love it at night at well
say my skin looks so young
plus it's pretty to look at.
my skin has never looked so good!
i tought the idea of both products in the same jar could work for me
i really love it
this has definitely helped with my dryness
i really like this product a lot
which i like a lot
i feel like i'm giving my dry skin exactly what it needs when i put on this moisturizer
while the speed that it dries initially made me nervous it seems to be doing great
this has been really making my skin feel nice
that being said it looks good before putting on foundation
'm on the hunt for another oil that works just as good
though they felt nice to put on
some sense in me noticed it did make my h
never felt like a product deserved holy grail status
when getting ready for bed i don't want my skin to feel irritated even if it looks amazing in the morning
the price point is quite fair for what you get
so here it goes
to be honest i thought this product was going to be gimmicky
you can feel the result after a couple times using it everyday
i definitely found it
obviously my skin was screaming for help
the reserve just feels so great on the skin
yes, it feels that good!
when i use it i know i'm doing so much good for my skin
i always get a zit at the first use of anything on my face
i need to tell you that this product is amazing
my skin finally feels like normal human skin is meant to feel
i actually liked it ;)2.
it felt very light
this one works for me
only really just liked the pure argan oil until this reserve
just feels so good for my skin
this is definitely a product i want to keep purchasing
it really helped my skin.
i really like it
it is really nice too
you really do see a difference over night.
had really treated my over all complexion
i think it's a pretty good cream.
i can tell a difference in my texture
it truly goes a long way
it's just crazy how good it feels.
i think it's a nice night time cream
i kid you not!
i really have to say i've found the perfect moisturizer for me
i can definitely tell my skin is more plump
she loves it as well
i really really love this product.
not a typo our humidity is really at 2%
i've tried several other moisturizers that i really liked
my skin has never looked so plump
really enjoy using this moisturizer at night
i definitely dispute that this jar says never greasy – i definitely could see this is being greasy to just about anyone
i still need to find a good day cream with spf
you really need very little.
i love really love the smell
makes my skin look so good
a little really does go a long way with this stuff though
i feel like it evens out my skin tone as well.
i liked the way it goes on
all i can say is this stuff is amazing.
although i really don't have a lot of darkness
leave them looking nice
i would definitely suggest this product to everyone who has dull
my husband always knows when i'm wearing it.
he tells me i smell like a creamsicle when he is close to my face
i really like the result
this stuff is like magic to my skin
skin care isn't a one size fits all so good luck
they really hurt my skin
my skin has never looked so flawless.
felt amazing after just one use
the way my skin looks
it really made my skin sting
it definitely does not break me out.
this stuff works magic on it
my face feel very smooth
i am sorry if you get off my the scent
it smells sooooo good
this stuff smells so so amazing.
it makes my skin feel really smooth
it doesnt feel very greasy like alot of other moisturizers
use as you feel it needed
i think it is too strong
i feel like it would be too greasy.
can't really see a huge difference
the one thing that bothers me with this though is the added fragrance
actually really liked it
i really like it.
i said to myself what are you doing?
it made me think it was greasy
i really hope they keep this because i finally found my perfect night moisturizer
doing wonders for my skin
they just dried the heck out of my skin
not playing nice under makeup
they really do a good job of hydrating my skin all day long
hard for this whole product line
i always look forward to washing my face.
i really enjoy this cleansing oil
this is staying in my bathroom always
so, i work for sephora.
none make my face feel so smooth
this stuff is very nice.
this cleanser really does that!
my skin always feels great after using it
you don't need much product at all to get a nice foam
my face feels really clean
it something i will definitely buy
and he really loved it.
i would recommend this for just about everybody
feel like i need more heavy duty products to really clean my skin
i really love it
makes your skin really softit has all the pros i could think about in a face wash
i don't want to get too ahead of myself here buuuut this face wash is amazing
i find it to be really gentle.
this seems to do a good job of keeping my skin just right
i love the smell of it, too.
i really like this cleanser.
i feel like it does the job well
i also think it's a great price for the amount of product you get
definitely recommend trying it!
my skin did not feel tight
i wouldn't recommend if you have dry skin as personally i feel it has a bit of the opposite effect as opposed to hydrating
well here it is!
this is the first cleanser i've ever used that has not left my face feeling uncomfortable
oh my... where have you been my whole life?
this one was really something else.
you actually feel clean
this stuff goes a long way.
it does really clean my face
my skin became totally different after i had my little one
it's definitely given me back confidence regarding my skin
it was hard to get it into my skin
remember that you wear your face everyday so take care of it
all i can say is wow.you.guys!
this stuff has quite literally changed my life.
if you suffer from rosacea definitely give this a try
my skin has never felt softer!
this cream has done wonders for my face.
it really is the real deal
i really wanted to call it hype
if you really follow the directions
i really love this product.
i really notice the difference.
it also gets me all the great luna effects without the smell
i really hate the high price tag
i do really enjoy how it feels
if you suffer from eczema/psoriasis this is most definitely worth trying to see if it works for you too
i feel they are in control
i feel so luxurious after i put it on
i started to see my skin just getting dull
finally my hubby felt bad that i was so upset about my skin that he got me the 1 oz
you gotta use some pressure to really get it in the skin
overall i just looked tired
they were pretty bad
one star off because i am worried the kind of tub it is in might not be good to keep bacteria out
nothing has ever really helped my skin
worth the money if you really want to see a significant change in your skin
'm seeing the reviews saying that it is too oily
i really really don't think that's so
it's so good that i feel bad for the others.
it feels so comfortable
my face always responds well
it really makes your skin softer not just after you apply
sometimes got irritated after a whole makeup day especially in spring
which really helps me a lot
to see if my lm was really all it's cracked up to be
then i feel like i have a whole new face.
up until the age of about 26 had really great skin
i know it is hard to fit in a budget in this day
samples are fun for trying stuff
so happy sephora is carrying these products now- because it'll def help me keep my vib rouge status
the price is ridiculous obviously
this never makes my eyes water
that helps me to feel better about the insane price tag
for my age that's pretty good since i see a lot of young youtubeers with the same lines
for skin if that makes sense
it is really small though so when i first got it
it just heals my skin this is so amazing
i really like it
it goes pretty quickly
i quite like using this cream.
really love the texture
disclaimer: i have very bad dark circles.
not so pretty face
and: this stuff actually is magic.
this really turned around my face i don't have fine lines
definitely get this if you want to minimize eye wrinkles
i am pretty sure i won't use it all before the 3 months is up
how my makeup looked
after using this product my skin really hasn't looked this good in years
i work a very physically dem
i can really tell that it is repairing my skin like it says it is
my very dry skin felt better overall after using the whole eve lom line
i really love this product
hope to always have it
i like the way they look
let me start off by saying i sampled this to see how i felt about using it for my dark spots
will use it up though because i hate returning stuff
i put this on as a primer pretty foundation application
definitely does everything it claims to
it has a light powdery feel which is great for those like me who hate that heavy
not all day but pretty close!
it looks like i just facetunned my face-
i got this stuff from influenster
i am really loving it
i got my mom to try it out
am kind of in love with it now
i really really really enjoyed this product.
i really love this
it also has a super lightweight texture so you feel like you are wearing nothing at all
i really loved the way it smoothed out my face
it is a very neat on the go product that i love to use for a mid-day touch up
thought this product wouldn't sit well with my skin type
this stuff does a great job if you like matte looks
my skin looked pretty awesome even without makeup
leave my skin feels good
so, this stuff is like magic.
it really adds that extra-flawless finish to your makeup look
it definitely does the job
it keeps me looking like me
i would definitely recommend this product
love it and i will definitely recommmed it.
love how it makes my skin look
i like to use it especially on those days when i know i'll be taking pictures because it just makes your face so photogenic
so for me this product was definitely worth all the excitement
made my skin feel pretty great
it's a good product for people with dull combination skin just like me
my skin has never felt so good
looked so good in my life
i feel like it's really helping
i started to really like it
it really does help to create a sort of airbrushed finish
i really like it
i've used this product when my makeup was really not doing well
it definitely created a smoother complexion which made me not require to use a primer which made me very happy since i believe the key to a solid makeup look is to have good skin
i've become so addicted i just wear it without any makeup as well as it simply just gives me a great healthy looking flawless skin
it also really helps me during the wear
i guess that’s another positive because you can feel that it really does work
let you guys know how it works for me
it really blurs out my skin
it feels really nice
it does get a little bit try so be sure to put moisturizer on first
what's really nice about this formula is that it leaves my skin matte
what i loved most about this product was what it did for my foundation
i really liked the product!
this stuff is perfect for helping me feel good about no makeup days
it really does give off a blue effect.
it reminds me of another product i love called porefessional by benefit
seriously looking flawless skin.
i personally have combination skin
it really does smooth out you skin
i really don't see it not working just as well
if you really want to treat yourself
this product is definitely meant to go after your foundation
that really make a different
which is something i look for
this product definitely gives the coverage you need
i loved how this really blurred some imperfections on my skin
have been really enjoying it
also love how light the product feels on my skin
i really like this oil cleanser.
i think it's great for getting face make up
i definitely recommend it
it really does wonders
gives my face a photosfinish look.
i really like this product!
i does help my face to look flawless
it takes a lot to really impress me enough to make my "must have" list
i really really love it
you're actually getting a really good deal
i would definitely recommend it.
every time i use it i feel like i am treating myself
the scars got so bad i just decided to give it a shot since it has some repairing features
but it really has an affect on the skin.
it's been doing great with my prescription skin care
my skin looks so good that i can get away with no foundation
even mentioned how it looked like i was wearing makeup because my skin looked so clear
not only did i notice my face had a nice glow
it goes on pretty smooth
thought what the heck
the smell omg so good never smelled anything better in any skin care
it still feels weird at first
at first i admit this is feeling weird on my skin when i applied
this takes my makeup off so well i love this!
i really really like this product
does a very nice job removing makeup
'm not sure about heavy makeup
after a week i guess my eyes
the smell has really grown on me
so this is definitely my new go to oil
because i always feel like it will reduce my skin elasticity
everyone has noticed that my skin looks great while using it
i love how this looks on my face.
i really, really like this product.
okay guys need moisturizer too.
just a moisturizer that really works
ladies if you want your guy looking smooth
i am pretty sure he'll like it and use it.
just what men like.
it pretty much does everything it says
i really love it
nothing compares to this stuff
this does work pretty well with my puffiness
this eye gel really works.
i wear glasses, so that's a big deal for me.
this stuff makes me look like i've been sleeping for years
this stuff is seriously amazing
'm pretty picky about what i need in an eye moisturizer
i can truly already see some sort of a difference
to already sincerely see some sort a difference is astounding to me
f that is really important to you i would recommend maybe using another cream in the morning for hydration
i can even feel comfortable going out without makeup
decided to give it a try since the reviews are really good
t was defensively worth the buy
this is probably the first eye cream that i've tried that makes me think it is doing something
the skin around my eyes feels so nice
to be honest none of them really work
being at that "fun" stage of battling oil
i felt like my eyes looked brighter
this is definitely going to be my go-to secret weapon for bright eyes for years to come
i always felt like i had great skin
it's one of the only eye products i feel works for both morning
which is really all you need
does wonders for keeping the skin looking young
this oil worked really well on my skin
i know that everyone's skin reacts to products differently
bonus i can feel good about what's in it
not only does it feel softer
it's very different from say
this is the one product i always make sure i have
but this stuff is a miracle in a bottle.
skin actually loves this product
love the dewy look it gave me as well
i can definitely see a difference in my skin
i will definitely try more of their stuff.
i can definitely notice a difference in my skin already
i especially feel good knowing all the ingredients that aren't in it
that is definitely not the case.
in a few weeks i honestly felt like my skin was brighter
thought i was going to peel a lot
i cannot say enough good things about it- it's awesome
i like how light this is
i really enjoy this oil
it's really hard to find something to help both.
you get a lot of product
i've never had my skin look so healthy.
i love that i can put it in my hair as well as on my skin
unbelievable since i have found this line of products i do not bother with anything else
so this stuff is my one stop shop
this is the stuff you need to buy
dont actually feel as if i've put on a moisturizer
could take this with me everywhere
trust me, this product is everything.
it makes my skin feel so moosturized
i do feel like it's evened my skin tone
it's funny that sephora literally just started carrying this today
it's honestly that great.
i wish i had words to describe how wonderful this stuff is
it made my skin really smooth
all i need are 2-3 drops for my whole face
the product spreads really well
think it's great even for guys
so for the price i think you're getting a quality product
pretty much everything else i've tried it on
i think it's genuinely a good value despite other reviews
this made a difference for me
i am trying to make him take better care of his skin
i really like it
something just told me to try this product
this products really works!!!
i could tell that this stuff was the real deal
really helps my pores stay small
which is honestly fine with me
i just do my eyes
i would definitely recommend.
really makes my skin feel amazing
my skin still felt great
so there are a couple of things i look for in a sunscreen: it must be lightweight
i always get compliments about how my skin glows when wearing this
i want something that is going to hydrate
i truly feel that i am putting products on my face that are good for my skin
i really enjoy it
it's pretty much good for all skin types
i've always had issues with my acne.
definitely sure about the treating part
it works great my skin break outs have dissapeared
'm sure thats whats also helping my skin to clear up
which is something i really liked
has really helped it stay clear
but i love how my face looks after wearing this .
after adding this, i don't feel dry anymore.
i've tried a good amount trust me
i live in south florida so things can tend to feel heavy very easily
i always love to try new products
it does feel great on the skin
love the feel of this on my skin!
it worked well for me now that it's summer
feel that it does a good job
overall, i feel like i look less tired.
is changing my mind about a lot of skin care steps
this stuff really makes my "tired mom" eyes look refreshed
as a new mom i'm always tired
you feel how cooling it is
i felt very comfortable going very close to the inside of my eyes
it's hard to tell how fast it worked.
i am lucky to only really have some fine lines under my eyes
which i think is really nice
i like how it goes on very smooth
i do feel like the skin around my eyes is smoother
it made the skin around my eyes feel so smooth.
i like the feel of this when you put it on
i personally feel it makes my eyes look a little brighter
i really do love this eye cream
i think this cream is so nice
things tend to break me out easy
foundation go on like a dream
the skin around my eyes is definitely firmer
you get a lot of product
i've never had a eye cream work so good on me before
this really changes my life because i've always had really bad dark circles
i still have pretty great skin
i will say they definitely feel well moisturized since i've been using this products
i think my eyes will be back sexy in no time.
i definitely feel it has reduced some wrinkles
all in all it's a pretty good eye cream as i do feel it made me look less tired
it really helps with the around the eye area
plus a little goes a loonnngg way so you're definitely getting your money's worth
i really like using this product.
have definitely made an exception with this cream
did not feel or look greasy at all
i definitely recommend this
i can really see the difference
i love the feel of this cream
i definitely recommend giving it a try!
however i feel when i wash my face with this
when i wash my face i actually feel it working.
pretty normal everywhere else
nothing really seemed to be working
this definitely has helped get it under control
i felt like i wasted a lot
i tried it out and it smelt so amazing!
it really helps with oil control
i feel it helps me prevent breakouts
i still get pimples here
this may help some of you who feel that the product is too drying
i've found what works for me
i definitely recommend this.
to my surprise my face seems to love it!!
im so excited to wash my face at night now it feels so relaxing
it works very well to control oil whether i am wearing makeup or not
the price point on this product is awesome too as you only need a very small amount to do your face
i love this whole line!
it drives me crazy
you can tell it's doing a great job deep cleaning
i loved getting this
you can feel a difference from the very first time you use this cleanser
i really liked it.

i do feel like it cleans my skin very well
love how it makes my skin feel
i do love the sense

i can definitely see a difference in the texture of my skin
besides making my face feel nice
i think this is one i'll stick with

i really like it!
this cleanser it's really good.
this cleanser did a great job at making my skin feel fresh
it's actually really nice it's refreshing
i really like this cleanser.
i've never found anything so good at getting rid of the oil
i really like this cleanser.
it really does control oil.
nothing was really helping
the whole regimen has really helped clear up my face
i love the way it feels
i'll definitely be buying more as it totally clears my skin of all make up
this is just right
a little definitely goes a long way which is something i really appreciate in this product
it really helps control oil
i especially love this cleanser because it really leaves my face feeling fresh
it really doesn't do that good of a job with taking eye makeup off
you will definitely want to do that first
i love how clean my face feels
i loved this cleanser because it doesn't take a whole lot
in addition, it really cleans your face.
i really love this cleanser.
my skin has literally never felt or looked so good immediately after cleansing
i am really enjoying this cleanser.
luminosity of my combo skin has never been as good as it is now
i feel like it gets my skin really clean.
i think it's because my skin is still adjusting?
work really well together
thought it did a good job of cleansing my face
it really helped to control the oil on my face which then helps with my acne
i wasn't really sure how i'd feel about it
i really like how refreshing this cleanser is
it's very smooth going on
i really like this product
it still felt amazing
i love the smell and feel of the product.
i feel it helps with the oil control
i really enjoy both
i've found what works for me
definitely helps control the oil
honestly i didn't feel it was a good substitute for sheer transformation on those days
noticing after a few hours that my face felt incredibly greasy
felt like it did nothing
they're the dream team
i definitely recommend this!
works really well to prevent my face from getting oily
there's also a nice cooling effect when u first put it on
this stuff works just fine with it
this stuff does a super job at keeping my shine at bay
it needs to be feel light
not really having high expectations for it
i feel like getting the set gives you the max results though
i really really enjoyed this product.
i like everything about this lotion except for the part that we don't get along to good
it causes me to break out like crazy
it makes me sad because this stuff works wonders!
genuinely like it so much that i can honestly review it as a product that i love
it is really tough to find an oil control lotion that feels great going on
to give my honest opinion about it
the oil control really helps.
i am so happy i received this product as a free sample because i can't live without it anymore i am impressed how nice my makeup looks when i use it before i apply foundation
i do feel like after the cleanser
this is my honest opinion
i really like this moisturizer
keep my face pretty balance
controls the oil really good!
i really don't like the scent
this goes on like
get very shiney throughout the day
i think it could work for all skin types
it really helped balance out my combination skin
i love the way it makes my skin feel
i knew there was something very special about it
my skins been really really dry lately
it does give me a feeling that there is a layer of protection on my face
overall, i really like this moisturizer.
most nights it feels light which i love
this whole line feels really good on the skin!
i really love how this makes my skin look!
it really does work
this stuff really helps to diminish them as well as improve the overall look of my skin
i think this stuff actually works
i am really liking it
it's so fun to push the little
you can feel your skin tightening as well as incredibly smooth the next morning
i just wanted something for that extra oomph lol
my skin likes this one :
i honestly think it has helped with the milia
honestly its really great
you can definitely tell it helps with fine lines
there isnt anything thats really game changing about it
it hurts really bad
it works so well i can still feel the cream at work after washing my face in the morning
i love this stuff but it makes my eyes water.
really don't like it
this cream sits really well under makeup.
i've always had horribly dark
after using it for about two weeks i can honestly say my under eyes have never looked this good :
i really wanted this to become my new holy grail eye cream
i feel like it also helps calms
i liked all the other ingredients i decided to give it a try
friends say my skin looks like it is glowing.
especially if you use a good setting spray with it
it works very well for me when i don't want to take the time to put on makeup or just around home or out doing err
she loves it and wears it everyday.
i am good to go
it definitely evens out the skin tone with
two layers of the product do not really give a big difference
i don't even feel it on my face
loves the way it looks on me
it works pretty well with that
using a concealer with it when u want to go pretty light on your face it works pretty well
hope in a jar on its own without the tint is great skin care so not only us it pretty
i am so surprised that it gives you such great coverage
feels great on my skin i don't feel like i'm wearing any makeup at all
i don't feel like i'm wearing any makeup at all
i think it looks really nice
everywhere else the coverage is really long-lasting
feels like i'm wearing nothing
feels like i am wearing nothing
it makes me break out
this stuff is the real deal
i've never had "good" skin
this stuff actually makes it look normal
i will continue to love this stuff
i really want to find them.
can i tell you all how many compliments on my skin i've gotten from my friends from within a week?
my face is really truly combination
this stuff is magic.
this concentrate looks crazy
i love this stuff and suggest giving i a try!
it feels so nice going on
it feels so refreshing
okay, so i have true combo skin.
found this combination so great that i don't feel the need to use anything else afterwards
feel like i've tried everything
feel like my skin is brighter
surprisingly this stuff works really good.
i definitely feel like it's making the skin tighter
honestly i wasn't really excited to try it since i'm 18
i don't really know about the "glow" part
my skin has never looked better in my whole life
she said it was nice
i think this one beats it
my mother loves this too.
i loved the idea of what i was putting on my skin
which really bummed me out
i really see a difference in my skin with this product
you get an ounce which is a lot for how little you have to use definitely will repurchase on my sample runs out so excited to find something that works so well for me
i feel like it does go away 10 out of 10 for me
this gets the job done!
i will definitely be adding this to my everyday skin routine
i really believe in caudalie products
i always put it on right before my moisturizer
my gosh my skin loves this moisturizer!
you'll definitely feel happier
thought it was okay
this stuff is seriously amazing.
got the whole bottle
just may not be a good fit for me
definitely a must have product!
really helps hold my foundation in place
i love that it literally makes all make up go on easier
i've never felt comfortable not wearing makeup
my skin looks so good and it has done wonders.
whenever i have a place to go that i want to look flawless i wear this primer
this stuff really just helps make all my foundations go on so smoothly
i feel comfortable wearing just this
my coworkers tell me every time that i have a glow or look healthy
i get compliments every time i wear it
i personally feel my face looks greasy with this on
this is truly one of the only things that works to hydrate
my skin was starting to look awful
i really tried not to like this
plus it's so pretty!
a bit greasy i'd be giving it 5 stars because of how nice my skin looks
i gave it 4 because i've put it to good use
i definitely bought this from seeing so many people praise this item
it's definitely up there in price
i really like wearing this with no makeup.
let me tell you this works as a primer so amazing
i've always worn a pretty full coverage foundation
makes your skin feel amazing
my skin has never looked so glowy
obviously thought this product wasn't for me
this definitely lived up to my expectations
i will definitely buy this stuff over
first off can i just say i'm pretty positive that the bad reviews are from people who got a fake
always expect a breakout if i change up my beauty routine
really work it in
this makes my skin feel and look great.
it's the one thing that has ever been a great product that was all over instagram
it's pretty darn good
it's good for many things...
definitely will keep this in my routine!
this stuff is magic.
lately my skin has been having really weird reactions to certain products i use in my skin care routine
my makeup looked great after applying it before foundation
this oil was definitely a win for me.
i personally love the smell by the way
this is the first thing i put on when doing my makeup
was kind of scared to use it with my skin type
it has done wonders
i feel like it helps my makeup set
you need to create a good canvas if you want your makeup to look good
love how it feels when applying.
none of them really impress me that much
this feels so good on the skin
i really enjoy this stuff.
only really liked it for the scent
i love using this as a primer because it feels really tacky on my skin which makes me feel like the product stays on longer
it reminds me of something from my childhood.
if you want a flawless complexion like you always see in those youtube beauty videos buy this
every primer i have ever tried in the past always has separated my makeup this however works amazing my makeup goes on smooth never separates give my face a smooth finish which is amazing since i have a lot of scarring the best primer out h
i definitely like it this as a makeup primer
i really liked this!
i've always used smashbox, which i still love.
don't really know where the acne is coming from
for awhile my skin was doing amazing
'm really not sure
it works well for me
i definitely love this
i definitely recommend this product
was happy when i read this is basically a combo of the two
it makes your skin feels so good.
i really love this product!
i think it smells good, it's not over powering.
it makes my skin feel so good
so basically what i do is i was my face
i also really love that the glitter in the product shows through my foundation
i always in the getting a lot of compliments when i wear this with my make up
i love mixing it with my foundation it really does stay on all day
i am not a big fan of the smell.
i like how my skin feels after the product is on
love everything about it
but this holds my makeup sooo well!
at $54 i really tried not to like this
thought that this might not be good to use on my nose at all
i am so in love with this product!
this serumn has honestly changed my skin.
it works so good with my skin type.
this is a really greate product
great stuff, sephora employee suggested i get it.
it works really well
i definitely recommend this product!
i just love it, you will too!
using this product to wash your face is an experience i actually look forward to as it feels very gentle
all of the great ingredients packed into this product definitely makes you feel like you are doing something great for your skin
'm always scared to try something new
definitely recommend this product.
this really takes everything off, i use it daily!
it breaks my heart because this balm feels so good when you use it
which was nice because i also sometimes deal with dryness
it's really sensitive this stuff works great for me because i don't mind leaving a little oil on my face
it definitely helps to brighten up your skin
truly gets all of your eye makeup off
just want my makeup off
this guy does a great job
i feel like i'm doing something good for my skin when i use it as well
and let me tell you, it is amazing.
it is a little greasy feeling when you first put it on
i love this stuff so much!
i think it is a big part of it
i found that it was actually soothing
also so nice that i am not going through a ton of cotton rounds
i feel for those who say this product made them break out because they truly are missing out on an amazing make up remover
i really like this balm.
it goes on really smooth
make sure i am getting everything off
it's so fun to apply this also.
love love love love this will be replacing so many of my products in my bathroom
never feeling like my face was really clean
nothing ever really wows me to the point that i have to have it again
i am pretty amazed and that almost never happens!
texture that i really love
it's the little touches like that that give it that high end feel
i always did feel like i had to cleanse my face afterwards
the sink was always pretty messy after all was said
which i feel left me as an oil slick
i definitely recommend trying this cleanser.
really well done product.
this got everything off
and it feels so nice.
thought i would try for myself
i feel like i went through it fast
it just makes my face feel so good after
i really love this balm.
i really enjoy this balm.
was enjoying it however my issue with that one is that i have to work really hard to remove eye makeup
the other thing that i love is it has a really subtle smell
personally i like it
i think you really should wash your face after using this
it really is that simple
i love everything that farmacy makes
first of all, i love the way it smells.
without even really trying
i will say that i have pretty decent skin
so for me it gets all of my makeup off
this stuff work wonders!
this stuff is the best stuff i have ever put on my face
i've tried just about everything.
my only problem with any of these products is that after taking off my eye makeup i always feel like my eyes are a little filmy
now i get little pimples here
my goodness it worked so well
wow has it made a difference in my skin
i liked this one
it is perfect for people like me who do not love to wear so much make up
just got this, and really like it.
i am usually not super excited about cleansing my skin
also helps me to not shine for the whole day
it has always been hard to find the right product
have never been able to find a moisturizer that feels as good as this one without making my skin feel more oily
this product is really really great i love how it's not greasy
it actually keeps me pretty oil free for around 8 hours
i've always struggled with my skin.
just in any week i can see a big difference to my face
the only down side for me is always that they smell like tea
love how smooth this feels on my face
s first i feel like it goes on really well
my throat felt weird
i could not get that taste out of my mouth for awhile
i feel like my skin can breathe now.
one thing to be aware of is that initially my skin would look a bit oily when using this product
how it helped my skin
they always gave me little bumps all over my face
has to be rubbed in really well
just happy to have spf so this is definitely a keeper
the first time i washed my face i could actually feel
and the way you 'popped' them open was so fun.
it's way more than alright - it's amazing.
bought the bottle because it is just that good
i really like this moisturizer.
i personally think it smells really good.
it also feels really cooling on your face
it honestly smells the same to me
i love how my skin feel every day.
that one is obviously not as good as this one
i truly do feel like my pores look smaller
the plus is it does feel
this made my skin feel so good
i really enjoyed it
were just not really cooperating with my skin
definitely don't have a problem with my pores
it sounds way too good to be true
it makes me feel very feminine during use
really feel good about pampering myself
learned to take care of it i always like to try new things although i'm not easily impressed by most products
wow my skin feels so plump
this worked really well
first of all like anything in dior it smells so good
i really like this one.
makes getting my eyebrows off so easy
one pump of this stuff
it really does a good job
definitely give you that burn
love the way it makes my skin feel!
this product has done wonders for my skin!
i would definitely give this a try
i think because of a foundation i was using
i would recommend this product to absolutely everyone who suffers from the huge pore problems like myself
i can definitely tell a huge difference
i definitely recommend it.
it really makes my skin feel firm
i can't really complain as it does awesome things
this mask definitely makes a difference
this stuff is the only thing that has ever worked
seeing that they created a mask i was hoping that it would be great
you feel that pull!!
this stuff work like nobody's business!!
you can feel/see a difference in your skin
i could definitely see some blackheads were gone.
i really love this product!
it definitely lives up to the hype.
already love what it's done to my skin
i really like it
best of all i saw results pretty quickly
my skin definitely looks brighter
where i really noticed a difference is under my eyes
always look so tired
something i have not done in years because my skin looks so good
this stuff is seriously amazing.
honestly if you need something to really plump
i am usually good to go for the day
my skin has never looked or felt better!
i travel a lot so to have this treatment bar allows my skin to look young
this stuff looks like a gel
"glowing" it let my skin feel
good stuff for my second purchase from them
also because i really didn't feel as if i was seeing any real results
it really has been a game changer for me.
my skin felt great after words
my skin is is always so even
i enjoy using this mask because it smells so good
everything gives me some kind of reaction
with yttp i found that my skin is really balanced
was actually a lot of fun to apply
the way it makes my skin feel
it's really calming in my opinion
perhaps it was the spf in the foundation that really gave it it's staying power?
i wear quite a bit of makeup
always have issues finding a cleanser that really does it all
i really love this moisturizer
it really helps keep that at bay
it comes out really easy
really loved using it year round because of how lightweight it was
it does not give me that feeling that it "sits" on top of my face
am glad to find a decent moisturizer that does not cause acne
i really love the texture
so that's an added bonus
i really liked this product.
got really really dry skin
it makes my skin feel so nice
my skin feels like new
this product made my face feel amazing
i love it especially for the summer
the mask itself stays on your face really nicely
it feels so nice
it definitely does help
i really like that it is in two pieces so that i can really contour it to my face
it felt nice on my skin too
so good on your face
my face felt great afterwards
also obviously you're not gonna get results after using it one time
love this whole line.
feels so good while on
i did really like this mask.
my skin felt so amazing after using it
there is also quite a bit of stuff in the ampoule pack
this mask is everything ✨ make my skin so clear ❤️
t's kinda hard to get your skin to absorb it all
not only was it fun to do
'm not sure which one contri
it's also nice the mask is in two pieces which makes it easier to put on
overally i really liked this mask.
it was really cooling
it did leave my skin very very shiny
so yeah this helped by clearing my pores
i did really like the experience of it
make sure i have a good amount on my problem areas that i want to focus on
it really makes a difference that lasts!
this one i use when i really need my skin to clear up
this really helped relieve the spots
while i do feel like hannibal lecter with this on
definitely adding this to the routine.
i really like this mask.
i just knew my skin would drink it in.
how my skin looks
it was really refreshing
i am definitely trying the other ones
i felt that it kept the ingredients on my skin very well
my skin felt tighter afterwards
it definitely tightens my skin.
i can feel it right after using it.
my skin felt so amazing from the moment that i put the mask on my face
after you take it off you can really see a difference
my skin felt amazing after just one use.
it was definitely strange
asked for help with my dark spots i would get something different recommended for me
my skin felt really amazing
it really makes my face brighter
its been really hot lately
feels so good while using it
knowing i saw a difference
i love this entire line of masks they are fun to apply
they make my face feel amazing
i really wanted to hate this mask as it was an impulse purchase
not to mention is super fun to have on
honestly it was really nice
i loved the feeling of the mask while on
really felt more awake
so glad i didn't- when i woke up in the am my face felt so smooth
he loved it too
i definitely recommend it
my face is really really dry
i honestly thought this wasnt going to be good based off some reviews
i definitely going to buy more!
laugh with it on
this really helped my skin!!
this one definitely did wonders for my skin
how it feels on my skin
the way my skin feels with it on
another tip, this cream really goes a long way!
i really, really, really love this mask.
feels so amazing on my face
i really like it
let me tell you this stuff is amazing
as i apply my skin is screaming thank you as i feel how it absorbs so quickly adding all my fav ingredients into one product
you would feel better knowing that as you buy/bought this
all the ladies in my family were really amazed how great my skin looks
this feels refreshing the moment i smooth it on my face
i love this whole line of tatcha skin care
it really seems to be best for those with oilier skin types
not only does my skin feels great from the moment i put this moisturizer on
this was so pretty i've decided to keep it out
so now i control myself
i liked the feeling of this
i got this as a 100 perk
it absorbed really well
one important thing is that we have to remember that all skins are different
my skin feels really smooth afterwards too.
i just really love this stuff!
works pretty well with me.
let me tell you this moisturizer is amazing
i wondered how it would work for me as a nourishing primer for foundation
i love everything about the consistency
this stuff truly gives your face so much hydration
felt the need to do so for this
with a good routine you can see results in 5 days
this felt really nice on my skin
not the case as all, it's truly been good to me.
i wanted to see for myself
i really love this cream!
i am always scared to try anything new or different
not only does it make my skin feel amazing
it smells really good the consistency is nice what caught me off guard was how watered
it felt at first lol i know that's not a good description
this is definitely a splurge product
break out really easily
i immediately loved the way it felt.
it feels so amazing on the skin after the shower
so this made me really worried when the sample said it was for oily skin
i really wanted to love this cream
i love the way it leaves my skin afterwards.
i am totally comfortable not putting any makeup on my face
my skin looks so clear and it feels amazing.
however, when i put it on, it felt amazing.
i don't think my skin has looked this good since high school
i know everyone's skin is different
that stuff was awful
this product got really good reviews
i don't think i look as tired
this product really helped bring life back to my under eyes
i wanted so badly to give this cream a 5 star rating
i've never really seen a difference
does all the right things for my skin and more.
hope you guys give it a try
i wasn't sure that something so lightweight could hydrate my skin the way it claimed
wow my skin looks so amazing whenever i use it
my skin has never felt so good.
what a difference in my skin
i am about 3/4 of the way done with my bottle
i love this stuff i have just begun to use it under my good genes at night
i think i found it
i really dislike cleansers that feel like an oil.
i truly do feel that i see some improvements after the last 10 days of use
i feel when she does something
big fan over here!
i wonder about added fragrance because of that
so far it's been very nice
my skin was so freaking smooth
if you really want a great combo
that is the farmacy cleansing balm so when i ran out of that i was pretty bummed
definitely a holy grail now for me.
my only complaint is that it stings your eyes really bad if it gets in there
never had good luck with any kind of oil
this stuff has helped transform my skin.
i feel like it makes everything really clean
she was raving about how great this would be for me
you really get what you pay for
once again she has created a product that my skin really loves
've always used cleansing oils before because thats the only real way to get off your makeup
i think oranges smell good so why not
it's also really nice
i feel this mask does what it claims
one for me this cream is amazing you can see the water
you feel the skin like a baby
feels like water going on
this stuff is seriously amazing.
definitely give this a try!
also put it on right after a shower there really is no bad or perfect time to use it i love love love it
it also feels really refreshing when you apply.
what a game changer for me.
i like how light it feels
i feel like it's a good moisturizer for the summer
i don't think it will necessarily be great for my extremely rough winter skin
i definitely feel like it is 50% of the reason my skin is looking so much better
this stuff feels like absolute heaven on the skin
so i really love this product.
otherwise though, this stuff is amazing!
could really tell a difference around my eyes as well
can definitely tell the difference in my skin
it smells and feels so good
i really liked this
it makes you feel glowy
i think all of these nice oils are overpriced
i rub it in really well with my fingers
which is great because i hate greasy-feeling stuff on my face like some moisturizers
not sure how well it works with foundation
it makes for a really even application
this stuff beats all!
this instantly makes my skin feel soooo soft
this is actually really amazing.
it does smell really good
i find you don’t need a lot of product
this oil i got because one of my friends told me about it
feel amazing smooth when i wake up
my skin is stressed right now
so always have acne on my face
already love how it makes my skin feel
it seems to have made my skin feel smoother
i always seem to keep going back to this one as a pore cleanser
i really do love this mask.
this makes it look like i've never had any issues with my skin
you can't beat the price for a really nice clay mask
i couldnt believe how great it made my face look after just one use
after your skin may feel a bit tight
hopefully my eyes keep getting firmer
it really makes a difference in my face
you can definitely see a difference in the firmness of your skin around your eyes
a great product to try if you have fine lines you want to tighten up
i can feel it instantly lift
the way my face looks
i never would've dreamed that this method would make my skin feel so clean
i definitely notice how healthy
i definitely recommend giving it a try if you have normal skin like me
i don't think it's terribly different from the clean energy
none have ever made my skin feel instantly smooth
i really like this product.
things will still go well for me
definitely not a good eye treatment for the mornings underneath makeup
would say definitely use this for dark circles
i definitely see that my under eyes look brighter
fun little treatment to use once a week.
so you can use it perfectly under your make up
i do use the whole line
this has really helped the lines under my eyes
this makes my eyes feel good
this serum has really really made a difference
i really do like this eye cream.
if you do the research on the ingridients you'll find how truly awesome it is
i felt like my skin was brighter.
i'll certainly use it all
this is so weird
my mom honestly looks like such a different person
i really like everything about this eye cream
when something works for my needs
working too hard for 1
i love the way this makes my under eyes look
it's just a fun step of the process
i love how quick it is
you can definitely feel it on your skin
i love how my skin feels after using one
've figured it out so everyone can calm down
it never ever really seemed to remove all of my makeup
i really like it
it gets the job done
it works really well for me personally
it's really not a big deal.
really enjoy using this cleanser.
it works well everywhere else
so this cleanser impressed me in that aspect with its ability to truly take off my makeup
love this soap because it makes my skin feel great
i gotta say i'm kinda obsessed with this one now
this is an alright cleanser.
i love how it starts out as a gel
maybe gotta use a bit more cleanser
this is a really nice cleanser that does not strip the skin
which is really what some people need
your products have done wonders for my skin
i wear lot of makeup at work
just makes my skin feel amazing
anyway, i think it's awesome!
it takes off my makeup very well
its the only one that hasn't made my skin feel weird or break out
the way it makes my skin feel
would probably be great for shower!
was really excited to see that de was going to come out with a gel/jelly cleanser
also for those who are saying it didn't foam make sure your face is really wet
i found this worked pretty well
i actually really like the packaging
it does make my skin feel quite tight after
also my face didn't feel dry afterwards like i experienced with the d
cerave in drugstore does the job just as good
my face always feels really fresh when i've finished with the cleanser
it smells really good like you just gotta try it.
i know everyone's skin is different so may not work well for everyone
that's what she said
it's made my complexion really nice
i actually think it's nice
they work really well on skin.
it does leave my skin with a bit of a tight feeling
this cleanser is so good beginning with scent i find it has a watermelony smell at first
then an after smell that's not that good
the product it self feels so good on the skin
i really like this cleanser.
my makeup looks so good every time i use it
i can definitely see it help reduce my pores
i will definitely keep using this.
give it a try really works
it lets you get a really good scrub going
the exfoliating aspect really makes it feel like it's waking up my skin in the morning
i no longer feel ashamed looking in mirror of a public restroom with the awful flourecent lighting
it feels so nice on my eyes
i love how it makes my skin feel after
i feel like it really cleans my face without being harsh on my skin
it really helped minimiza my pores
this make my skin feel soooo soft
i got my dad to try it with me
he loved how smooth
the clay mask is definitely good for clearing out your pores
there is a lot of product in here for me
it get's super tight and you can feel it working.
beautifully packaged yet the only downside is that there isn't really a lot of product in each side
i love the mask both of them feel amazing on my face
i'd definitely want my full face to get the benefits of hydration
it really does work
you can really feel it too
not sure what another reviewer was talking about because i thought this was a great size
it is hard to know if it is going to work on my face when i get only 2 uses
i really like this mask.
that's just not fun
what i love about the product is definitely the sonic factor no lie
really does make my skin feel firm
haven't really noticed a difference in my skin.
yet i think was fun to tried it when i saw it at the store
try it for yourself to see!
i do think it makes a difference in my pores
i do feel like my skin is smoother after using.
i really enjoyed it
i honestly thought on social media people were editing the mask color to look more vibrant
i definitely notice a difference!
comes off pretty welll
this stuff makes my skin feel
this stuff actually works
i never really had problems with my skin before
gave me a look that makes me feel comfortable to go outside without any makeup on
not only does it make you feel like you are laying in a field of honeysuckles
fresh has great stuff so i'm not too surprised.
this hand cream smell so good !
yeah.. the smell is strong but it's not bad.
i really like the scent
how it made my skin feel smooth afterwards
i do this a lot so for me that's a plus
my pores have literally never looked so good
i swear my skin has never felt so good.
my face looks a lot clear.
this gets 10/10 for me.
it made my skin look
it's not often i feel this great right after a mask
usually i'm on the opinion that if something will work for you is gonna affect your skin in a positive way right a way
feel like ive tried everything under the sun to clear it up
number two the cleanser actually works really well
i really like the smell, eculyptus is my thing.
couldn't believe how my skin felt afterwards
you feel the mask working
i love how this feels on my face.
not gonna lie, this stuff smells pretty gross.
definitely going to continue to use this!
its very hard for m to find a product i feel working
i really like this cleanser.
seriously the most fun thing i've ever gotten to wash my face with
i feel like it does a great job cleaning my skin
want to get good use of it
i would really recommend it
i found this cleanser to be very fun
i really love it
it really gives my face a nice deep clean every time i use it
i love this little thing
my skin loves it too
i definitely felt like i get a nice cleanse when i use it
also, so fun to use!
it's fun to use would buy again.
i really love this product.
it cleans my skin really well
i would definitely recommend it!
not only is this product fun to use
it does clean your face quite well
you get the right amount everytime
it's so much fun to use
definitely seems to be clearing my skin.
you get a lot for your money
i loved this product it has helped my skin sooo much i couldn't believe it
my only complaint is that it gets really small real fast
i think it's not only really cool
but this product is so fun to use.
she always always had little red pimples on her face
like the way it feels
i really like this face wash
really cleans my face and fun to use.
it's really fun to use
it takes off my light makeup very well
not really expecting it to cleanse well
the fact that this was a ball made it really easy
takes off all my makeup very well
unlike other reviews it does leave your skin feeling really clean
it's so fun to use
i love this thing so much
i find myself wanting to use it
i feel like my nails dig into it when using.
even if you're not blown away by the results it's still extremely fun to use
if you are trying to find something like the one-step cleanser
i don't like the smell very much
except it is kind of hard to hold a ball
it does have special scent which i dont really mind
not to mention super fun to use
i wanted to let all the girls know that this is an amazing cleanser it feels so so silky smooth
if you're a good girl you know to always add your moisturizer
it really was fun to use.
i really like it
from opening it to actually using it is a fun process that i'll never get tired of :
mostly it seems fun
only first time but my face felt really good.
probably a great idea to start your older kids on a skincare path so they want to wash their faces
it almost feels like a stress ball
not only is it fun to use
it's so fun to play with
i love the way it feels on my skin
it really helps my pores i love this i will be purchasing another one
it feels really nice on the skin
i know that the green one is sooooo good
it makes it feel so fresh
this mask was really fun to try.
really like this face wash
great for problem skin i can really feel this clearing out my skin
the mask it self is amazing the only reason it doesn't have 5 stars is that it is very small
this mask felt like it was working instantly.
i love the way my face feels after wearing this mask
i would definitely recommend this mask to anyone with problem skin
they feel very nice
they were both really nice
they feel good on the skin
it says "4 uses" you can definitely get more out of it :
my skin felt amazing afterwards
here are my thoughts
it still worked well for me
luckily this mask was just as good!
it i do like it a lot.
it feels very nice on my skin
i do feel like my skin is brighter
i guess what i am trying to say is my skin texture has improved dramatically
that's saying something considering my skin hates me
as a matter of fact my face felt great with this on it
or they make me feel greasy
i know everyone says this product smells good
on top of that i was using acne products that were doing really great things for my acne
i love all things fresh
definitely a new go to for me!
definitely feels like i'm giving my skin a drink of water when applying
i love the way this makes my skin feel!
i love how light this feels on my skin
i enjoy the product a lot!
this stuff feel amazing when you put it on
it's fun to apply and it really does work.
i usually have a couple breakouts from that oh so fun time
this product gives me life!
the real good stuff you have to mix a little to get
i really like how my skin feels after using this mask
i love the way it feels
the consistency of the mask is kinda weird
so we both tried out this mask
that being said, my skin loves this mask!
love it both ways!
the mask felt great going on
the smell brings me back so many memories from my childhood
you definitely feel it on your skin
i definitely thought my skin was softer
thought it must be amazing
this looked weird going on
am prone to having breakouts here
i really like this product.
it was always out of stock
i love how my skin looks
everyone needs to learn patience
i love the way it feels going on
i do feel a difference in the texture of my skin
then it really absorbs
multiple customers at my job told me i looked beautiful
i wanted something to couple with my tlc framboos
made my skin feel amazing
you know it is that good
they were obviously raving for a reason
to take it easy at first when layering to see what works for you
i really didn't think this would do much for me however applying this before my moisturizer really increases the suppleness of my skin
really hope it'll help with my acne scars too!
i really enjoy using this product both morning
i can already tell a big difference
i am really into natural products
i find it really nice to pat on to my skin every night
it's definitely do something.
either way it's definitely a good investment to your beauty regime
i love how they both work together
feels like my skin is improving with every use.
this stuff has transformed my skin
i really recommended them
i am not sure about the "brightening" part though
i honestly feel like it has helped to clear up my skin
you get a lot of product
it did definitely cause my skin to purge a bit
you get a lot of product
keep looking in the mirror thinking- wow girl- something you have used made your skin look fab today
give it a try if you want something gentle
it's pretty good at removing makeup
really good product made my face really soft.
i think my skin was craving something to balance it
reminds me a lot of the cosrx cleanser
it feels so good!
i love how clean it makes my skin feel
unless i want to for fun
is not really that bad
my skin looks pretty darn good without makeup on
that i personally like
it feels like water going on
to me the benefits are well worth the wait plus it has a refreshing feel on my skin as it sinks in
i really like the way this protect makes it look better
i liked it well enough to repurchase
i've always had good skin because i do take care of it
keeps it looking good for my age
have been using it for about 1 week now it really makes your face soft
i feel like it tightens
i see and feel a different in my skin.
it goes away in a couple of minutes so thats good
this product really works.
i feel in this case i am getting what i paid for- vitamins in liquid form- they don't smell good-
skin looks great and you can feel it working.
thought "no way this product works
they're just trying to make a good sell"
i would definitely recommend this product to everyone
it feels so refreshing
this stuff is a miracle
using them together really makes a difference
keeps me looking young
i feel like i'm now beginning to see a tighter
i love the feeling of this on my skin.
definitely makes my skin feel smoother
it does feel good on skin but am waiting.
i really like this set.
it is helping me along with the aging process- people who find out my real age think i am lying
i've decided at my recent age of 30 that i should probably take really great care of my skin
loved them all with an exception of hope in a jar
but this stuff went on like water.
i wasn't quite sure if i saw a difference.
to have these results in just 7-10 days is pretty great
i constantly get complements on how young looking my skin is
can tell a difference in my skin tone
i just like the way it makes my skin feel
never feels greasy, always feels amazing!
really, that is my only complaint.
there were 2 philosophy think beautiful thoughts giftsets left over from christmas
thought i got other things
it really works for me.
very into the "no makeup makeup look"
my friends always compliment me on how well my skin looks
my skin started looking more dull it just didn't feel as good as when i used it
feels so so smooth
i wonder why i look so tired
it really does something good to my skin
but it loves this product.
this stuff does what it says
this is coming from someone who takes very good care of her skin
ok this is a serious game changer guys.
the whole line is like this.
this mask feels so cool on your face when you put it on
it's a really good size for the price, too.
it's been really difficult for me to find products that work for me
i love the way this mask makes my skin feel.
i think my skin looks less tired
the smell is okay
t is a very full container so you really get what you paid for
definitely recommend this to all the people who underst
it is so so good.
i actually got one of my guy friends hooked on this haha
'm still suffering with acne
definitely a must have mask!
everyone loves this product
love how my lips feel n look the next day ❤️❤️wud totally repurchase it
it makes my lips look young
it makes them softer and they just look so good.
so i gave this baby a try and it is amazing!
really not sure what it was
this stuff is so so so so good
i would say that the packaging is pretty
i really like this product.
'm definitely about that life
'm the kind of person that puts foundation over my lips when i am doing my face
my very last step is always lipstick
i really like how it works with my lips.
this stuff really lives up to the hype!
you get a lot of product for your money
was very tired of all these masks saying would help my lips
this little guy has helped my lips out a lot
the consistency feels a lot different
i still used it in the morning because it feels great
i would definitely recommend this
i am never sleeping without this stuff
i reapplied this morning just because i loved the way it made my lips feel while i'm wearing it
couldn't believe how great my lips looked
definitely helps with application
whatever magic this stuff is
this stuff really works.
i love the little spoon too to get it out so you don't get anything in it
you get a lot of product for what you pay for
really has staying power
usually for everything that everyone raves about is not for me
this one actuallly truly works
it is going to be my bff for the rest of my life.
you actually get lots of product
my lips have never looked so good
i never felt like i experienced amazing results
when i found out about this stuff
makes my lips feel nice
which i really appreciate
feel like there isn't a chapstick in the world that can help
it really does work!
this honestly has made such an amazing difference for me
've been on a hunt for a great lip product i've seriously used everything
i feel it will be lasting for awhile
i think the price is really fair since you get a big jar as well
my lips feel amazing as soon as i put it on
my lips have been so hydrated throughout the day that i don't even feel the need to use aquaphor anymore
i feel like it's a good amount of product for the price
i really like this product.
it looks polished enough that you could totally wear it during the day
really working it in with the little applicator
they're always top quality
this product really moved me
if you put it on during the day it makes for a pretty ok gloss too
'm not sure i'm ever going to run out of this
i see good things happening with this product
it looks like it would be kinda hard to get out of the jar
honestly that works just as good or better
this stuff is so amazing!
my lips feel great after using it.
so glad sephora got it too
i recommend this strongly to anyone who has bad habits to pull their lips very badly
i put it on throughout the day too- i like its' texture
it gives me life
it really helps as a sleeping mask
it leaves your skin feeling really good.
it feels very good on lips.
this mask feels like a dream going on
this stuff really works!
i feel a bit indulgent when i use them.
this moisturizer is one that i will definitely be adding
it was really good
i got a lot of use out of it
i'll definitely repurchase after i'm done
i can totally see myself using this in the winter as well by just adding an extra layer
i love the way it makes my skin feel
however, i loved this!
this stuff feels great is light weight
i actually think this is a really nice night cream
if i 'fix' my redness problem somehow in the future i'd definitely use this product
i love the way my skin feels immeadiately after application
helps me to feel like i have a product that actually works
you can feel confident in the phrase "a little goes a long way
you get a lot for the price
i feel like this is going to last me forever!
my boyfriend even started using it because it felt
i actually really love this face cream
i am really weird about putting products that have a scent on my body
it works for me
my foundation always goes on super smooth
i think the product itself on my skin works very well
i can really see myself continuing to use this product
i especially would love to try the eye sleeping mask once it hits the us
it doesn't really feel like anything is on your skin which is amazing
i like the texture a lot
really enjoy this moisturizer for night time use.
love what it has done for my skin
i like to go pretty natural during the day in the summer time
i feel like the consistency is just right!
i really have enjoyed this.
i personally like it
i love how it feels
i really really loved this one
i honestly have to say that this stuff is incredible
go all day with out any weird separation
this product really makes a difference in the way my skin feels
just feels like nothing is on your skin
i notice a difference in how my face feels
i can honestly say this stuff is awesome
so far, im really liking this moisturizer.
i love the way it made my skin feel.
i am so in love with this product!!
i really loved it
it makes my skin feel
i personally like my skin care to smell more fresh
i gotta say it has worked wonders on my skin
i love how quickly my skin absorbs the product an how i feel my skin afterwards
do feel that this has helped
i really like using it as a night cream
this stuff is pretty good!
i'll definitely keep it around
the way it makes my skin feel
every time i use this my skin feels amazing all day
i think what i like most about this cream is out light weight it is
i've always heard good things about this br
i am only giving it 4 stars because it did make my skin a little too moisturized for my liking
i heard so many great things about laneige
this stuff helps with fine lines too
it always left my face greasy
i would definitely recommend this product
because i feel it does make a difference
i really enjoy it
found this really nice almost a little to rich for my skin
nothing has really helped.
you can literally feel the moisture all day
i really liked this one because it was lightweight
i definitely think that this cream has it beat
it does feel a bit heavy on the face which i'm not a huge fan of
i also really loved the smell of this cream.
makes my face feel
i love how light it feels
finding the right moisturizer that really works
i like be this stuff!
i will definitely recommend this
am always on the look out for products that are soothing
really does feel similar to water in terms of hydration
i can honestly say the moisture was definitely still there
i would definitely recommend to others!
i would definitely say it is neck
it will feel very fresh
i think i would definitely want try their water bank sleeping mask since it is a gel
i make sure to bring it with me
otherwise i would have obviously picked a moisturizer for my skin type
so from that aspect
i don't think it works well under makeup
a lot of things break me out
this stuff helped clear it up
so clean that sometimes when i'm really tired
i decided to give this stuff a shot
i definitely have to put moisturizer on right after using this
it really does make your skin look brighter
this just works wonders on it
it left my skin feeling really smooth
i really love this moisturizer
my skin has never looked and felt better.
i feel like the bottle is begging me to drop it
overall i really recommend this product to anyone
i am pretty combo
i work at sephora trust me i've tried everything
i really like the packaging too
i noticed pilling which is never fun to deal with
this is definitely it
it works really well with my makeup
the glow i wake up to the next day is unreal imo compared to the other products i've used in the past
it works like a dream under makeup
i've really been enjoying this
lightweight texture that i think will work really well for all skin types
my skin hasn't felt this good in years
i really felt like it helped my makeup stay on
honestly i'm in love with this moisturizer.
my skin feels so great after using it
i personally really see the difference in my skin the morning after i used it
i think you definitely have to keep using it to see the effect
my go to was always glamglow flash mud which is great
would have to consistently use it to really see a difference
my skin looked so good
only giving 4 stars because i really hate the smell of it
i really just wanted to try it because of the color of the mask/bottle
i would definitely get the full size when i run out because i felt like my skin looked all around better after using it
i definitely notice that my skin is brighter
tells me that i'm glowing when i have my makeup on
haven't really seen results
it also feels really good on
this is definitely a staple in my mask collection now
this mask is so so soooo good
it really helps even me out
how it feels on my face
it's definitely not as cooling as glamglow
which is really all you need
didn't feel like the lochness monster wearing it
i will definitely buy
i felt like this would suit all skin types
i will definitely be purchasing this product for myself
t's really hard to find something that my skin likes
my skin felt so soft the whole day after i used it
every time i use this i see a big difference.
i love the way it smells and feels.
you also get a lot of product in this jar
it'll definitely be a part of my beauty routine for the summer time
it feel smooth after you applied it on your face
i really enjoy it
amazing, made my skin feel so smooth.
putting this mask on was really nice
which is not good for your skin
i don't really use a lot of make up
this is good news for me since i am horrible at using an spf unless it's built into other products
i've always been a fan of origin skin care products so when i heard they came out with a tinted moisturizer i had to have it
really loved the smell
however, i really really love it.
put this stuff on—it feels cool
i feel better instantly
this really helps me in so many ways!
this stuff works wonders on it
it feels like nothing on the face
nice if you want to use this as an spf
as a teenage who doesn't wear a lot of makeup thing is the perfect thing for me
it is so natural looking which i love!
feels like you have nothing on
feels really light on my skin
made me look really oily
my skin loves this stuff!
it felt very nice
i felt like i didn't really need moisturizer
i didn’t like the fact that the serum felt like it was just sitting on top of my skin
i would definitely recommend this product
i do feel like i've seen a difference in my face
i'd definitely recommend giving this a try
i honestly liked it a lot
my face felt good
i got a lot of compliments on my skin for using it
makes my skin feel so good
i loved the way this made my skin feel.
i still really like this
i really liked it
it leaves a very nice feeling right after the fist use
thank you influenster for letting me try this product
loved the way it made my skin feel
i really liked this product
while this product made my skin feel nice
i did love the smell and the feel!
i really like this product it absorbs into your skin very quickly
make sure skin feel awesome
i definitely liked the idea of this serum because i liked getting two different serums
i definitely noticed my skin feeling firmer
not overpowering that i really enjoy
i really enjoyed using this one
it just the right consistency for my skin
the 7 day trial packaging wasn't very good because it was hard to exact the serum
all i can say is that this is a really nice serum
it really did improve my fine lines
i could definitely feel a difference in my skin
because i am obviously not going to use it
i feel my face skin a little tighten
i've never felt so beautiful naturally in my life
i would definitely recommend it
a 7 day trial of this is hard to really judge.
this product did leave my skin very smooth
after the 7 days i really liked it
my roommate complimented me on how i seemed to be "glowing" lately
i could tell my skin felt tighter
i love how my skin feels after using this product
would definitely recommend this to others!
i can definitely see a difference in my skin
after the 3rd day i really noticed how my skin looked less dull
honestly the first thing i thought was
i am going to break out like crazy
think it would be tough to use in the mornings
i do really like what this does for your skin
my initial thought about the serum was how much i personally love the scent
i would definitely like to continue using this product
the way it felt on my face
i think my laugh lines need some serious help
i am dying for a whole bottle because it's a game changer
i don't think it make my skin look any younger
it did make it smoother so that's always a good thing so overall it's a great product
to me it's very smooth for me
it definitely evens out your skin tone
it felt really good going on my skin.
i would definitely recommend this product
it's always refreshing to find a product that lives up to all of its claims
i really liked it
it didn't make me feel greasy at all
i feel like i left product in it
yes my skin does feel smoother
it was pretty easy to use
it sunk in really well
which i hate seeing in my face
would definitely recommend to everyone.
honestly, it coulsnt have come in a better time.
i would definitely recommend this for dull
at the end of the day when i'd remove my makeup i couldn't get over how great my skin felt
i'd definitely recommend this product!
the one thing i truly like about it is the fact it's not very think at all
i think this such a good product after i wash my face with it i feel so fresh
am seriously considering buying a full size since it seemed to really agree with my skin
i think this is a nice little product!
i really like the scent as well so that is another bonus
my face looks so good that i left the house without makeup today
i've always thought that i've had good skin
loved that it did make my skin too oily since that is a big problem for me
i am very picky about what i put on my skin
i don't really have fine lines
i love a lot of things about this product
could be totally honest with no expectations with how it worked for me
this really takes a toll on my skin.
i loved this stuff
i like it a lot.
my skin seems to love this product
overall i feel like this product did what it was advertised to
don't know if really would work for me in that aspect
i love how it feels on my skins.
it really does wonders for dark circles
as for as brightening im not sure.
i don't wear much make up so this stuff is amazing
feel of my skin would be an understatement
it's actually the very first ingredient
my skin is in pretty good shape generally
my foundation look afterwards
i love this product for the results i'm seeing on my skin
it's definitely my new must have.
when i do it's going to be one of those big under the skin ones that look like a huge cyst is about to pop through
this stuff really is amazing.
this stuff really works!
i got this in a murad kit so maybe it's everything in conjunction
so like 20 because my life sucks
definitely recommend if you have an important event in a couple hours
thank you so much to the lady at the store that recommended i try this product when i came in with a horrible hormonal break out
seriously, this stuff is amazing.
it only makes my skin softer i guess.
so this mask is really amazing stuff.
it helped me be able to feel the mask actually working
hey we think the power peel is amazing we gonna start selling every step separate
i guess i'm just a girl who enjoys it getting dry
i will say that my skin did feel refreshed
it feels so nice on my skin.
i've definitely noticed that it's very plumping
i really like this moisturizer.
my skin has never looked so clean
this mask really works!
i definitely have healthier looking skin
another great things about this mask is that you don't need to use very much
this mask also never makes your skin feel tight
i really like that they use natural ingredients
just does something amazing to your skin
i seen on their website all the good things
i really feel like it clears out my pores
this mask truly has changed the way my skin feels after using this product: smooth
it's either really good or it's really bad
i really love this product!
i want to clean it out without feeling like my skin is going to crack
i love how this feels.
it's hard not to when you're so amazed by how smooth your skin feels
i love how i feel after spending a weekend getting pampered
it is also great for spot treatments if i get a pimple
active ingredients make me feel like the product is working hard for me to have the best skin possible
i love the way it feels
i really struggle with my skin
i pretty much can't imagine my life without this gel now
it give a nice cool feeling too!
i love how this product makes my face feel!
i wanted something light
i love the way it feels on my skin
i like feeling like i have younger skin :).
definitely allowing yourself to get your money's worth of product
it feels like nothing
it never really worked
'm glad someone has thought to put these two products in one
this will definitely be my everyday eye treatment
that is huge for me because i always crease.
makes my skin look amazing even after a night out
i love how light it is
feel more alert looking you know you have found the right product
say good bye to the tired look
i've just never really tried them
i know that sounds crazy
which for a 30-something mom of two is hard to come by
all of my father's children share one thing we all got from him
really like the consistency
does that cream feel so nice
this product feels so good on my under eye area!
it definitely makes my concealer go on a lot smoother
i've definitely noticed my under eye area is not so dry anymore
it's just the right weight too which really makes it very comfortable to use
because of the gel like feel.
i really get annoyed when people come on here
i liked how my skin felt afterwards
so tired of reading "feelings
if this still keeps up the great impression after a month
this is the only thing that works for me
definitely recommend this product
didn't feel there was a huge difference
she asked me what i was doing to my skin because it looked amazing?
this oil feels so nice
i feel like i've been searching for something like this for my whole life
i also want to try the eye cream heard amazing things about that too
i really enjoy this one
letting it soak is important too
it also makes the eye area look dewy and pretty.
i don't have to mix anything together
it tingles a bit but it does wonders for my skin!
i think this is one of my new favorites that is going into my skin care rotation
it really left my skin feeling
it feels nice on and not too heavy.
i really like using this in the morning because it helps give my skin a glowy base for my makeup
the smell really perks me up
i really like it
the feeling of your face feeling
it does remove face makeup really well
so you have to make sure your face
i really like this cleanser.
this sure does come a long way with helping your skin
overall i think everyone should give this product a try
the jar is really big
it's saying a lot as i am a kind of person who keeps changing the skin care product lines
being that i'm 27 now i think it still works good for my 20's
i recommend it for someone just getting into skin care or who has decent skin
even my doctor commented on how alert my eyes look
you can really feel the difference before
can use it on my whole face
can't believe how good this thing worked.
it works wonders for me
this is the only thing that's ever worked for my acne scars
especially anyone over 30 looking to really care for their skin as it ages
i honestly feel like it improves my skin
this stuff is really magic.
the mask smells so so good
it's seriously sooo good.
my face always looks so smooth
i felt sooo good
you won't feel it
i think this gel heals them because i don't feel that stingy feeling the next day
this stuff made my face so smooth
i find my makeup goes on so much better especially on he tops of my cheeks where i place highlighter
nothing really helps it go away
when i tell you that these two are my dream team
definitely something i will repurchase.
it really looked like my skin was smoother
purchase all ole henriksen products because they always work for me
only one i really noticed a difference with was this one
i'll be using this stuff for life
being a mom i needed something that is quick
omg in just little time i've never seen my skin improve so much
i do think this product works well
hopefully the new formula doesn't smell so bad.
nothing else helps my skin quite like this.
makes face feel so clean and love the light sceo
especially when i have bumps which is what i feel it works best for
this stuff has helped my breakouts
has really transformed my skin

can definitely see an improvement
i definitely recommend it
ok i had a big break out
this stuff is magic.
it makes me feel great about my skin
this product has honestly changed my life.
small bumps on my face which i thought i thought i would be stuck with all my life
this combo has done wonders for my skin
this product has done wonders for my face
i really didnt like it at first
i didnt like how it felt going on
i've always needed stronger glycolic acid to stay clear of all pimples so that's probably why i still got one here
i feel like it's really working to help clear up some stubborn blemishes
i probably always will
this one really works for me.
i get compliments on my skin a lot
it seemed to work wonders on my skin
some nights it really stings my face
i would definitely recommend.
together they have done absolute wonders
definitely give it a shot!
everyone keeps asking me what i'm using
feels makes me believe it's doing something great to my skin
i think this product works really well
my doctor told me at a very young age there was nothing i could do
this stuff keeps those at bay
i can definitely see improvement in y skin.
even my friends commented that my skin looked smoother
you will also feel a weird sensation.
im excited to see what my skin will look like after an entire bottle
i also feel like its helping with the appearance of wrinkles
i find this product to really smooth my skin overnight
i always try a different aha product thinking it'll be better
i love the way this makes my skin feel!
t's always a go to for me
i grabbed this honestly because it smells so good
it turned out to be a nice choice to add to my routine
the two together have made my skin looking very healthy
this product did a really good job at keeping my skin looking doey
it feels like its really going to stay on for a long time
ive actually even gotten compliments on the wonderful smell this product gives off even though it is very suttle
this feels so good on my skin
i really really really love this product not only is it great for my skin
this stuff seriously softens my face & i love it.
i really love this stuff; it is very calming.
does a lot for my skin
i like them real well
i took one star off because the smell is pretty potent
oh my gosh i love this much more then the other moisturizer
it makes my foundation go on like a dream
this stuff works wonders
that being said i love the smell
even my boyfriend comments on how good my skin looks
i reccomend placing in fridge for an amazing cool feel
i always get nervous when trying new skin care products
this is definitely my new got-to moisturizer!
i really like it.
this stuff helps immensely.
i truly recommend it to everyone i see
i really love this moisturizer.
this product honestly smells like orange creamsicles
have to be pretty careful what i use on my face
i know that sounds like a lot of product on your face--
this literally nurtures my skin like nothing ever has before
definitely a must-have product for the beauty junkie
not only does it do a great job on keeping my skin moist
everything else makes my skin break out
i only know this because i can feel them
honestly that was enough to heal my face
i feel like this one takes the w
i love the way my skin looks after applying
i really feel like this product somehow cushions my skin
i wish it worked with my skin because i really liked it otherwise
it seems really thick
now i kinda look forward to it in the morning
maybe i'm a tough case since i use retinoids
it does a very good job
i can instantly feel a difference the moment i put this on my skin
again, it feels so nice!
it smells just like creamsicles which is a little weird
it really lasts a very long time.
as far as the smell goes, i think it's great.
sometimes i feel like you don't need much
there is definitely a creamsickle scent
now it is just a very light pink
never have i had a moisturizer work so well on my skin
you should really try it
it felt nice on my h
i noticed that it broke me out in my t-zone area as i am very sensitive there
when i tried this i was pretty hesitant to try it because of the smell
love the way it feels
i really like it
gets the job done
it took me years to learn that your skin shouldn't feel tight after you wash it
i can really see a difference
i feel like not all cleansers are for everyone
sometimes you just find one that works perfectly for you
has really helped to brighten up my skin
my skin looks so clear
i really felt like i had to
i already feel this product working wonders for me
i wouldn't say it really brightened my complexion
i feel that i can find something better
i love the smell of it too
i would definitely recommend this product!
i felt like i needed to review this product.
no matter what type of water my face feels sooo clean
always getting one at a box-store
this gives your face a really nice clean look
maybe 2 pumps if i have on a lot of makeup
gets it really clean
she said her face has never felt that clean
just feels good on the skin
it has definitely helped my skin
the only bad thing is that i think my skin acclimated to it
i still think it's a great cleanser
this cleanser did a nice job of getting my face completely clean without making it feel dry or tight
i feel confident enough to go with out makeup if i feel like it
really liking this cleanser.
you know what this cleanser reminds me of?
very foamy so a little really goes a long way with this product
loved the results so far my skin feels clean
i am getting compliments on my skin all the time
thought it was ok
my face feels great afterward
wow my face is looking so good with these products
it actually makes my skin feel clean
i've tried a lot of different cleaning products i really like ole henriksen
my face feels really clean.
i really like the face soap
not too moisturizingits just right for my combination skin
makes me feel very clean
refreshing my face always feels after i wash it
never forgot the feel of it--clean feeling
i do like it a lot
i can definitely tell the difference after about 2-3 weeks
my skin has not felt this good in a long time.
which is really weird
i really recommend it
in the last 8 months i developed pretty bad acne
my makeup would look good in the morning
it is definitely a staple in my routine now
it took me a bit to actually like this moisturizer i wasn't sure if it was helping with much
my skin also feels great in the morning when i use this at night
it goes really well under makeup as well!
what amazes me most is how instant i've seen a change in my skin
makes my skin feel good
i really like the smell also!
it is really the bomb diggity.
this is really helping to clear it out
i feel like a little goes a long way for me.
it always looks smooth
my skin always feels the guilt when i try to switch it up
i love the way it feels on my skin.
i really like the feel of my skin when i use it
feel good on my skin
i decided to go with something of a gel consistency
remembered the sample of this guy
i really liked this moisturizer!
after using it my skin looked really healthy
really makes a difference in my skin
i definitely recommend this product
especially for those who feel constantly let down by moisturizers
enough to make my skin feel amazing
i really think this had a big part in it
i am not sure it is really doing what is says for my skin
thank god this cream exists because every other one i've tried has been terrible
when i wear it under my foundation i feel like it sinks into the skin perfectly
using it every day i've really noticed a change
i've started to get compliments on how good my skin is looking
i really like how light this feels on my combo skin
this worked really well for my skin without breaking me out
it really does what it claims
which this one definitely is
this one really works
this stuff stays on
i've definitely seen a difference in my skin
i am pretty young
i feel glowy after using this
it feels so good on my skin
i really like how it has a citrus
it always makes my mood better
my family asked me what i did to it to make it look so healthy
nice because they noticed the big difference on my skin
this is definitely different- light
spend 20 min doing everything else before adding my spf
it made me look young when i was wearing it
it absorbs really well
i guess everyone's skin is different
i must say this stuff definetly works for me
makes my face feel so soooo soft
i really love this stuff!
i think it works really well
i really enjoy it
i really feel it makes a difference in my skin care routine
i've definitely noticed the difference it makes when i go without
smells very much so like oranges and i love it.
definitely has helped bring my dull skin to life!
i really like this product.
feel great i have been using the serum for about a month now
everyone always think i use foundation
i instantly knew i was going to love this product
the first thing you really notice about this product is the smell-- citrus
i definitely recommend this product for you
definitely in my loved items
i got so many compliments on my skin
i realized what really works for me is just squeezing one pump in my fingertips
i think my skin is brighter.
i did feel like my skin seemed brighter, though.
i always get asked what i use on my face
i really liked it
just trying to keep my complexion young
i already saw a pretty big improvement
this stuff has really turned my skin around
it feels great when you're applying it
the smell is good too
my face feels so nice and smooth in the morning!
this stuff really works.
so amazing i got my mom to buy it
i really love how it makes my skin feel
sephora folks- feel free to put in my play!
it feels so refreshing
i find this really balances it out.
after using this stuff my face feels so moisturized it's actually an amazing discovery for me i'm so happy
i definitely suggest this.
that says a lot for me!
i always see quick results with everything i've tried by this br
while i still love this stuff
i cannot believe how great my skin looks
i am afraid to change the combo up because my skin looks better than it ever has
i guess i have to keep purchasing more of this great stuff
i've gotten compliments on how young
have a really hard time finding a moisturizer
the products in this line have seriously done wonders for me
does not feel like it is just sitting on top of your skin
i gave 5 stars cause the price is really good too
i really would recommend this if you were thinking of getting it
i love the way it feels as i put it on
really liked it so decided to buy the full jar
i actually really enjoy it
it really is amazing in this cleared my skin
gets the job done
my boyfriend always tells me how good my skin smells
i think this is "the one"
t's not too big of a deal for me
this definitely takes the cake.
just has done wonders for my skin
feels really fresh on my skin.
i think it was just my skin getting used to the new products
i dont think i will go back to a different moisturizer
i think it smells really natural
as a teenager i had really bad acne
calming so whenever you apply it you feel like you're doing your skin a favor
great alternative if you miss this product like me
i really love it
this really helped regulate it for me
it works really well under my foundation.
made my skin feel
doesn't leave my face feeling greasey which is nice because i have combo skin
no matter how great they are
i cannot get over how much my skin loves this stuff
it makes my combo skin feel so great!
the smell is different but i really enjoy it.
this product really helps with the shine problem
i really do love this moisturizer
this stuff is pretty good though.
it actually absorbs and feels nice.
i don't really think so
i prefer to use it as a night creams just because it really stays on
guys on how nice my skin was looking
it feels so good on the skin
and it smells and feels so good going on!
it feels like a treat to put on.
i actually look forward to it.

i learned that switching from product to product is not good for me
and it really helped my skin.
i definitely recommend this product to anyone.
i like the way that it makes my skin feel
i can see the difference in my skin.
at first i thought it is really thick
it gets so bad

i want to look real as i live
is just a feel good product
to scream did everything they told me would do my skin looks amazing to look younger fermer radian hydrated everything i wanted
a nice young man showed me how to use it
now i love it my results are amazing i used it on a burn
with no greasy after feel
this is definitely a great answer
it felt very thick and did not really sink in.
this cream is really thick going on
it's not like some products that you can feel "working"
feel like i have finally found the perfect combination of products
i texture is very think
i try to pat it in good
i mean never looked so good
always feels like i just applied it
i really love this cream for my face
definitely not a good daytime moisturizer.
i always use it at night
really stays with you all day
i just had to get down in writing how much i adore this product
tend to leave a feeling on my skin -- like something extra is on there
when it does it makes my face feel amazing
this moisturizer is definitely not for the timid.
i'll probably love this cream
say how great this product is.
i wanted to make sure that this creme didn't do funky things to my face
so it is alright.
i really prefer the fresh repair
it does last forever because you need very little to use on your whole face
my skin was really smooth
i unfortunately had a bad experience buying this product at a different store
this one stings my eyes pretty badly
there is also something weird about at least my jar
it definitely works for anti aging you can tell the difference in a little over a month
it truly is like giving your face a drink of water
always makes it feel smooth
i love the way my skin feels
people are really exaggerating about the scent.
i personally think it just smells like all other philosophy products smell
the product still does amazing things for my skin
i really like how the product felt on my skin
it may feel like you're working at it a bit long
personally i just feel more comfortable knowing that the product itself doesn't contain unnecessary fragrances
a lot of times i can be bad about taking care of my skin
also, i might just be strange (and that's okay!)
made it feel very smooth
definitely worth a try if you have really dry skin
i really like the "old" formula.
it feels so light
truly believe that my skin's texture has become smoother
i love everything about it
i really, really do.
i really really love this moisturizer
because it is pretty gross
there has been a lot said about the smell
my face could really tell the difference
it is always a saver
my skin looks so good in general now
i understood why everyone is obsessed with this
pretty much everything you want from a night cream
it has really improved them
said "where did all my pores go??"
i feel like it's just as effective
it's really helping him out too
i think this is working on my skin.
works wonders when i feel a pimple coming around
i'd definitely recommend this product.
definitely in the fine lines
it really works:) it does what it says.
my skin hasn't looked this good in years
you should be good to go
so here it is!
this stuff really works.
you tried pretty much all kinds of acne treatments/routine
my skin has a flawless, even-tone now, love it!
i can tell a huge difference in just 1 month.
i get comments all the time at how young i look
i think that philosophy's help me is a nice
it definitely takes time to see a difference
help me help myself is right!!
help me has definitely helped my skin.
i can see the difference in my skin
my skin loves this stuff.
i really like this product.
most of the time i don't feel like i need a moisturizer after
've added this to my routine
after trying other stuff
okay so for starters i know i am very young for a person who uses this product
been playing around with it since i was 10 so my skin wasn't plump
eventually i started bc which really screwed with my skin
even after i learned how to take good care of it
my skin had been pretty clear for years
i really love this product.
i really wanted something for anti-aging as well
it really makes my skin looks better
honestly i don't have much wrinkles really
i liked this price point
this stuff works like wonders!
my skin has been pretty bad recently
this stuff makes a difference in my skin big time
i really like this one
this cream definitely is
definitely something i will repurchase
have to make sure i top it off with a little moisturizer
love that stuff too
didnt need a whole lot of "help" a side from a good moisturizer
nose look expecially good
i really like what the product has done for me so far
i know that it helps the fine lines on my face
feel like everyone 40+ can benefit from using it
it worked really well
it really worked wonders on my skin
this stuff changed my life
feel like i needed to wash it 4 times a day
really wanted a non-birth control way of keeping my face clear
whether it has smoothed my fine lines is hard to tell
i feel the philosophy product just does a better job
feel a difference when i don't use it
keep doing what you do!!
i really like it
it definitely delivers what it promises
i see myself having it for a while
i feel like i need to use a moisutrizer
even when i was a kid
it feels really nice
the feel is good
i gave this four stars because i love the way it smells
feels on my eyes
after using the whole bottle i couldn't tell whether it was really doing anything that beneficial besides moisturizing
i work 8-9 hours a day looking in a microscope so my eyes get tired really fast
i get really annoyed when a product is packaged in a way that makes it impossible to use all of it
when i love the stuff so much
i feel this does what it says
it is perfect for young girls who always stay up late like me
i really recommend it to you
my doctor even told me i can never have them go away because of my lack of sleep my whole life
also the way it feels on the skin
so sometimes i feel very awake
i just wish it did a better job on my dark shadows under my eyes
i do feel fresh
i believe it helps with my puffness
definitely a staple in my regimen from here on out
love using this stuff in the morning
it really helps me look more awake
i think this product helped with my dark circles.
however, ifind myself using a lot of product.
i definitely recommend this
i think it definitely works
it makes me feel good
i am a believer though in spending more money on something that is gonna give me the best results
you can really feel a difference.
i like it a lot.
so i love the way it feels on my eyes.
remember why i liked it
i love the way this goes on.
love how they feel on my skin
i think this is helping for both the dark circles
that's good enough for me
that's especially true for this one
i think it's helping a lot
it feels so good when you put it on
was explaining to one of the ladies there that she likes light weight
she said it feels like she was hardly wearing anything at all
that works for me
my eyes don't look tired anymore.
i feel like a new me
making you feel young again
my friend loves it very much
it feels nice and light going on.
i like this product a lot
this stuff is light
i am sad to say that i never did get the eye gel home
this product really does work.
wooowwww it's just so good
i can definitely see a difference in my complexion
i always use glamglow when i feel i need a mask to really get gunk out
by the 5 star rating you can obviously tell i loved this product
my skin had never looked so bad
i can honestly say i have never seen my skin so nice before
this kind of thing being a bit out of my price range
definitely after two uses i saw a difference
after your skin may feel a bit tight
this stuff helps with my pimples so much
i still love it
i do not remember the last time my face ever felt this smooth
my skin looks so clear
this mask honestly changed my life
always feel nervous when i use skin products
this stuff worked right away
definitely love this stuff
whenever i feel like my skin is acting out
i truly believe it has helped to keep my skin clear
my boyfriend and i used it and we both loved it.
this is my first review because this stuff is so good
i actually really love this mask
just try it out for yourself
i've always had good skin
it's honestly an amazing mask
easy clay mask this is your guy
my skin feels so nice
i really liked it
they both seem to work great together
the great thing about this product is that it can be used as a cleanser as well as the mask
wow - now this was a mask!
i really enjoyed it!
it felt like it was really penetrating my pores
this mask really did the trick to help refreshen my skin
it did feel like it was getting tight
it definitely does help to control the oil
gets the job done when my skin if just feeling gross or having some r
which was honestly an odd experience
i liked that it came with a spoon-type thing
i do like the way my skin looks
i could see my skin looked smooth
i definitely recommend it.
i will definitely recommend this product
not greasy- really like this
the best part about it is that i often get weird "bumps" on my face that is not really acne
this product is perfect for when you're not sure why your skin is reacting/breaking out
this guy really helps with it
my skin just feels like a baby
you can definitely see a difference on my skin.
this is just so gentle for me
i always enjoy this mask
really is a game changer.
doesn't smell very good
obviously there was a lot to get rid of
i love masks that you can see working
pretty good value too considering the size of the bottle
while this mask does make my skin feel great
i love it... you can feel the clay working.
i still love the product
i actually look forward to my am/pm routine because this stuff goes on like a dream
it worked really well
this seems to be working for me
for me it does breakout my face a bit
caudalie has always been my go to moisturizer.
and i get compliments all the time.
the smell is very pretty
working for sephora she gets to try alot of samples
it makes my skin feel "new"
it's too much of a good thing for my skin
i love this because it really does moisturize!
i hope it works for everyone as well as it is working for me
this moisturizer definitely does the trick
it gets the job done
it goes on the skin really nice
whenever i used that i didn't really feel like i had moisturized anything it was so light
my skin always feels comfortable.
not only does it make your face feel unbelievably soft
i love all things caudalie
the fact they uses grapes makes me feel i trust their product
have had a really hard time finding a moisturizer that doesn't make me break out
never ever feels greasy
how it feels on my skin
just the change in climate helped me change my mind
she said it was a good cream for night that works like anti aging without the stigma
would definitely recommend this to everyone!
we have very different skin types
t has always been tough for me to find a balance
not heavy at all i feel like i'm wearing nothing.
just love this product
so we tried it for a week and loved it.
i like the way my face feels after i put this stuff on
never makes me feel itchy or irritated
makes me face feel great!
definitely going to check out more products from this br
i really like this cream.
i really liked this
it feels really nice on the skin
no idea how it got there, but i'm glad it was.
as others have expressed i just don't feel like it's truly cleansing enough for my acne prone areas
this definitely helps that area
smells realy great too!
i love how my skin feels during
good to use right after work or school if i'm wearing no makeup
removes the make up pretty well
it just doesn't do that great of a job getting makeup off
we both love this
i am not one to wear a lot of makeup
you will definitely want to try this out
this milk is wonderful for removing makeup--maybe not for hard core waterproof products
it feels nice to get everything off
not have your skin feel like it was stripped
i really enjoy using this
my face did not feel greasy.
it takes a little getting use to the feel of the cleanser
so gentle and just right.
felt like very smooth
felt like it was doing nothing for me
i 'm very tired of using makeup remover
which really says something for me
which i thought was strange
all it was doing was messing up my ph balance on my face
i love the smell and feel of it.
i really love this cleanser.
this definitely gets the job done without being harsh
after i started having some pretty awful hormonal breakouts
i feel this made a huge difference in my face.
thinking it wouldn't be good
found myself without any
never have i owned a cleanser that truly helps the condition of my skin--they've all just been "meh
it cleans really well
actually recently switched to something else that's also quite amazing
i feel like my face just looks really refreshed
i actually really like that one too
it just gets the job done!
makes my skin feel amazing
my skin is usually very dry so this product is great help of me
i loved how it made my skin feel
after using it your face feels nice
it still does me good
love how it feels on the face too
i definitely notice the difference
my face always feels a little sticky afterwards
the feel of this product on my face
i instantly felt a difference in my skin
i do feel it is a bit stripping, though.
always follow it with a moisterizer
this just really cleans my skin!
my skin looks really good
really work it into your face
how clean it makes my face feel
love this one even help me with my breakouts
knew it was a good br
of cleanser on my clarisonic is enough for my whole face
makes me feel so clean
did i mention that it's pretty affordable?
left my skin so nice
definitely something to invest on if you want better skin
it made my skin feel great.
i really liked it
i really like this cleanser.
i really like this face wash.
lathers up really well
works really well to take all of my make-up off
i really do love this product
it feels really good on the skin
it does leave my skin feeling
i am not a huge fan
i am so happy to have finally found a cleanser that does everything i need it to do
feels really good on the skin
everything about this product has me obsessed
i definitely recommend it.
it has kept my face so very clear
buy another it works so well for me
it also doesn't have a strong scent which i really like
i really do love this cleanser.
this stuff is great for those pimples that come out of no where
it works so well for me
it works for me
it helps me that way when i use it.
it really works, and it really calms my skin.
i feel like i'm loosing out on half of the product
it's done a really good job of minimizing my acne
it worked really fast
when i see myself getting a little bump i put it on
this stuff really does work!
this stuff actually works
i can say that this one definitely helped my skin clear up
i really like this product.
if anyone gets stress prone acne like mine i would definitely recommend this product
i feel like it takes a while
so when i feel a bump under the skin
we love this product!
:) i definitely would recommend this product
i always take this little beauty with me when i travel
i really like using this product.
i never feel dried out.
this stuff worked soooo well!!
i used it really for breakouts
i really like this spot treatment.
this breakout treatment really really works.
'm always very concerned about acne products that will dry me out even more
could't get to sephora for a whole week
this really does work well when applied after washing my face
just goes away like it was a bad dream
i still really love it though because i think it really helps to calm those monthly angry pimples i get around ya know
make sure you rub this in
i am definitely a lifer now
gets the job done
it was working pretty fast
this stuff is like magic.
the is certainly an as needed product so that is something to keep in mind
i am ok with that tradeoff
i really like this boscia breakout treatment
i felt like my eyes didn't look so tired in the morning
i really like it
this really does the trick
and my eyes do not look so tired.
i feel like my eye area is brighter
thinking a good moisturizer should be all i need
i would say that it is a great under eye treatment
i like the way it goes on
it works for me
all i can say is that my skin really really likes this product
i really enjoy this eye cream.
actually i feel it's more like an eye gel-feels smooth
i like it pretty well
i love how it felt around my eyes.
i feel like i'm starting to look old.
they're pretty messed up from some autoimmune skin problems
it makes my eyes feeling nice.
refreshing when you put it on
this stuff keeps my face clear
it definitely makes a difference in the firmness around your eyes
soaks right in & really does the trick.
it took me so long to find such a great eye cream
was told it is ok to use latisse with this eye cream
i am a little biased though because i literally love their entire line
it comes with a lot of product
definitely give it a try!
really aids the skin look the way its supposed to
i can feel a little tingle when i apply
which assures me it is doing its job
i feel it works very well.
while my under eye circles are definitely not gone
obviously i love that boscia makes products without preservatives
even after i had used the sample which was pretty great
i really liked it
it really is light
i really like the texture.
plus it had a bit of an older woman vibe i didnt really like
very bad acne for years
overall it's worked very well for me
it really just takes a dab
make sure to drink a lot of water ladies
from that perspective this eye cream seems to do well
i really do love boscia products
i think all gels do not fair well under makeup
this has really helped with dark circles under my eyes
i've always had dark circles
this obviously shows that these products are working
i love how it feels after you rub it on your face
i feel like it never absorbs
this product really helps my skin
you really only need a little tiny bit to cover your whole face
it actually feels very light
this product does have a strong rose smell to it that i actually really enjoy
i loved everything in the set
you see real results.
i always try to get different moisturizers with my points
i definitely see a difference.
which i consider a good thing
i love putting this moisturizer on--i get this child-like glee whenever i do as if i'm really treating
i do tend to just use this at night after cleansing since it makes my skin look great when i wake up
because i'm terrible about not picking at them
i felt this product did help to lighten them
i really like this cream!
my skin just simply feels amazing with it
honestly, it makes me smile every time i use it.
long story short--i'm soooo glad i did!
i think this is growing on me to love it
i also remember how beautiful my skin was that year
my sister convinced me to try this stuff because she said it helped to clear up her skin
i still get a lot of acne
i am so happy to find this great cream that moisturize the face over night
i really like this product
really wanted something that would brighten
it does have a weird smell to it
i don't really think it smells like roses
my skin always feels
had to make an exception for this stuff
this product is amazing it tightened my skin on my forhead in a matter of 5 days it's like i'm getting younger
i really like this cream.
love it and i will definitely repurchase
i always feel so fancy after applying!
i really like the consistency of it
i also liked how it layers under my foundation.
so try for yourself
it really worked well for me
really gave a me a glow that i've never had
i love it, makes my skin feel great!
it honestly does brighten your skin
the smell is just great i always take a minute after i apply the mask
it makes my skin feel amazing
it works very well however the consistency is so thick i feel like i'm applying paste to my face
this winter was very bad on my skin
i love the way my skin feels
it lasts forever cause you get so much ans it really does make your face feel clean
the reason i like this a lot
has a lot to do with the scent :
this stuff works wonders
i like to try new things
all in all i really love it.
just keep to what works
does a great job of getting the makeup on my face
it was a good price too and you get a lot.
also tends to feel really tight after washing
you do feel clean after
always go back to this type because i feel it does just as good of a job as a similar product for double the price
really is a great cleanser glad i was able to pick it up during the sale will definitely repurchase
that i still have some left is amazing
i also love how it just feels so clean & natural.
it definitely removes all makeup
the smell is okay for me.
realized that this product can definetly make your skin a little dry
(my acne was really bad on my checks)
it really works for me
the fragrance does not break me out which is a huge issue for me
its pretty good at taking off all my makeup too
i think it's a good option
didn't make my skin feel tight
you don't need a lot of product to get a good clean
i've always heard good things about this cleanser
i've noticed how it's always winning awards
if you really want something for sephora this is a decent cleanser
honestly stuff from the drug store will do just good of a job
i always wash my face twice so this is good as a first wash
think the price is really good
really removes my makeup also
definitely not harsh on the skin
i really enjoy using this face wash when i'm on the go
it has done wonders for my skin
or lack there of anything pretty
definitely my new forever cleanser.
i really liked it !
feels silly soft going on and coming off.
i feel like a lot of them are scented or they just do not do the job
my make up looks amazing when i am done
finally i have found something that makes me feel
i think it has actually helped get rid of some of my acne
i noticed that it's very light
i really like it
it's still sooooo good
i love the way it left my skin
i actually get compliments on how smooth
if i'm wearing a lot of makeup this definitely removes it
i guess this would be a great choice
it had a weird smell kinda like alcohol
it really is a great cleanser even though it's so gentle
my skin looks so great love it so glad i got it in my box
i actually see it making a difference in my skin
only reason i'm not giving it five stars is that it just seems pretty basic to me
it took pretty much all of my makeup off
that all the pulling on my skin couldn't have been good
i love how my skin feels after using this product
nothing seems to work for me
it was really peeling
now she loves this cleanser
after just one use i could feel the difference
keeps my skin pretty clear & even tone.
i would definitely recommend it to a friend to use
i will continue to use this as my cleanser because nothing has ever felt so good on my face
your skin will not feel tight
it is really soothing
feels like nothing at all is on my face
i gave it 4 stars b/c i feel if you skin was super dry it would be great for you
the bumps had been there my whole life
it feels -good- when i put it on
friends have remarked that my skin seems to "glow" more since i started using it
make sure you get your face nice a wet
you are good to go
definitely helps with my blackheads too!!
probably the best thing about it is that you need a very small amount
i really like this product.
spot treatment have done wonders to my skin
this makes my face feel so good
really evens out my skin tone without making it feel too dry
i like it a lot.
i really love this cleanser!
the combination seems to be working pretty well
this cleanser is really getting things under control
murad has always worked very well for my skin
it made my face feel soooo much better!
i really do think it reduces redness.
my skin has not looked this good in years!
really helps with those pores
i figured it was just stress
i would've liked to have tried all of them
every product i ever used always irritated my face
it's also the only thing that has ever worked for me
not really sure how much this product has helped
this stuff has really changed all of that
i can tell it makes my skin look calmer right away
i feel like it keeps my skin "normal"
i great for guys who don't like "that kind of stuff"
he likes it lot
he truly walks around feeling face saying how he can feel it tightening his pores
he said "please get me the good stuff from sephora' it's well worth it
he loves the pump on this product
my skin was ok already
i actually really like the scent.
i find it amazing that i noticed a difference so quickly after i started using this product
i know its hard to get guys to wear face creams
i would definitely recommend this product
i really look forward to using the face cream before i go to bed -- it spreads very smoothly
this actually works for me
picture porefect is the only thing that has worked consistently to keep my oily
i decided to really get serious about getting rid of them
i first purchased it because i was tired of my skin looking so bad
i love love love how this transformed my skin getting older changes the skin
i've always had bad skin
i come back to this guy
i like this product a lot.
i really recommend trying this.
my makeup looks better will definitely purchase when this runs out
i really can tell a difference in my pore size
thats what this product does- it brings everything out
you really need to try
picture porefect really does what it says
this is definitely worth trying if you have been bothered by large pore
although my complexion is pretty clear
the consistency is really great- not too oily or serum-like
i can already tell a difference in my pores
this product really works!
it kind of has that smell/ feel
you need very little to cover your whole nose.
you will really notice the difference
i just started using it again because my skin really looks better when i use it
thank you dermadoctor- glad i tried your products-was tired of trying so many products that have not worked for me even with faithful use
which i thought would work for me
i knew i needed to use something to improve the appearance of my skin
nothing but good things to come!!!!
this product is definitely now a part of my routine
i really like this product.
the product also makes your skin feel really smooth
the things we do for beauty!
so a lot of products don't work well for me.
this product really works!
... did i really spend $40 on this?
this stuff works like a dream
skin does not feel too tight after use.
it honestly has made my skin so smooth and even.
this is definitely not a miracle product
because i feel i am not 100% clean
it is ok if you really want to get rid of your pores
i really feel like this product is very effective
this stuff really works!
i think it really works.
i really love it
as it really gets every drop of oil out of my skin
i feel like the container makes it
it is really a treatment
i really like this product
i know this is helping
i am in love with this stuff.
after using this stuff
i really like the way this product feels on my skin
it really does help tone down the redness
it really works for him
he loves this product
this product really helped
it is the only thing i have ever found that really helps
it also worked really well before makeup.
i really like this moisturizer
this feels so good going on.
she saw me and how clear my skin looked.
it sure worked for me!
esp when seeing my skin in the car when its really bright
i really like this for my face.
my skin got very bad again
it really helps me a lot.
this stuff is magic
i think this product
because it really works
this seemed really soothing
i am sure it works great for some people
for me it was just ok
is so much fun
today my face is not very red at all
they always perscribe me with products that dry out my skin terribly
it made my skin look so good
it actaully made my skin feel softer again too!
i guess now is when i'm going to have it really bad
that really sold me
is feels so good on my skin
this cream really does what it says
it is actually a little weird how well it calms
even in the summer this product does not make my face feel greasy at all
this is everything i want in an eye cream.
it works nice under makeup too
when i haven't gotten a good night's sleep
it really dimishes dark circles
it feels like it's doing something
my mom has also commented that she noticed they're lighter
feels so good on your skin
i really like this product as i work deep nights
i am always trying different products
not only is the eye cream seem to be working great
especially if your born with it
i really enjoy this eyecream as i work deep nights
the tingling means it really working i think!
my eyes are always dark
i really like this eye cream
i feel like this is the first product that has actually made a difference
just make sure you use a good moisturizer after use
this definitely has helped with that as well
my skin looked horrible compared to how my skin used to be before cancer
which is really annoying
it definitely works to clean
this stuff is amazing, it makes my skin so soft!
this stuff works miracles on my skin the day after
i really like how it treats my pores.
you really need to try it yourself to see how good it is
it is really strange to get used to though-- you have to get your entire face wet
you have to try it yourself to see how amazing this bar is
really paranoid about what i was putting on it
i stopped using it because my skin was looking ok
it was actually starting to freak me out
but i really like this one.
okay so back story: i have very fair
angry breakouts then this guy will be your savior
i always wake up with happier skin.
everytime i use it my face feels extremely smooth
i do think that it played a part
very hard to get the right consistency for the mask
i started getting really stubborn
this is really saving my skin right now.
"this bar really helps to get out any
my skin just feels so smooth
my skin always feels 100% better
try to only use it on my body sparingly- such a shame 'cause this stuff is great
i am still not believing how wonderful this product is
i wanted to make sure i gave it time to work
like maybe my skin is just really bad
i think using it daily really does help
it really helps clear your skin
i am not as big a fan of the bar
i am glad i found this because i am tired of putting chemicals on my skin that do less than what this does for me
i personally hated the stuff
i like the way it feels on my skin
this bar has done wonders to my skin.
that broke me out really bad
i feel like this product is going to last me a long time
my skin has never been horrible
i truly feel like this product helped with acne as well as the overall health of the skin
it definitely lives up to its name- as it leaves your skin looking
love how it makes my skin feel
my skin broke out really really badly
i think it works pretty well
my skin recognizes it and knows what to do!
everyone should try something that is natural
could it really work for me?
it works amazing my skill has never looked better acne is like gone
i really liked it
it left my skin feeling really fresh
i never really went big on cleansers
i am definitely stocking up on this one
i definitely suggest giving this a try
this worked so well for me that i could stop using my moisturizer
this stuff smells sooo good and feels so nice.
the smell is pretty good too!
definitely recommend this product!
never found a face wash thats done a better job
it makes my face feels like a baby
you truly feel like you're improving your skin with every wash
with other products i feel my skin like paper its feel really dry
i still feel my skin hydrateded
i think this would work for all skin types.
definitely removes all my makeup.
i would really recommend it to all skin types
feel like i just had a facial done
i kind of disliked it because of the smell
this works for me
i think i've gotten maybe 2 pimples since i've started using this
this is my everyday am
my face always feels clean
it feels like it's doing something for my face since it smells so fresh
and not to mention it smells so good!
makes my skin feel really good after using it
i actually quite liked it
after using this stuff i'm honestly so excited to wash my face
definitely recommend to all my friends
i'd definitely recommend this to any skin types!
it's a bit expensive which really saddens me because i have to save up for it
the good news is it doesn't take much product to work up a nice lather so hopefully it will last a long time
i personally don't like really harsh cleansers
i definitely recommend this product :)
it may feel as if it's too "light" to be doing any good
this just feels really cooling
it gets the job done cleansing-wise
don't use moisturizer i get so many compliments everyday of people telling me how smooth
love this product a lot.
it makes my skin feel really clean
7oz just to try it out since i've heard many good things about it
this stuff makes my face feel great afterwards
fresh products really agree with my skin
i often get compliments on how nice my skin looks :
now i actually like the fragrance
definitely not my am/pm wash
feel the need to keep it in my line up
i really do like it.
i will always recommend this because it works.
never a product has been so good to my skin!
i've tried everything there is
definitely give it a shot
i really don't see the big deal with it
there really is no down side of the product to me
i really like this product.
i will say that it definitely stings pretty badly when you first apply it
it works wonders for me
always helps clear my skin
enough to make my eyes water a lot
honestly.. it burns like a son of a b*%&#!!
you can see it working!
i would definitely recommend this product
this mask does tingle quite a bit like the other reviewers have said
it works for me too
i can look past that part because i love the way my skin looks
i like that feeling
this is definitely my new go to.
the color is pretty cool too
it certainly gets into my pores
similar to the algae cleanser that anthony makes you can feel the this stuff doing what it says its doing
he liked the smell
i think it definitely does everything it says in the full description
i love it too!
it seems to do amazing things for my skin
this product worked very well for me.
which he really likes
my guy is wearing this mask
this stuff really sucks up the oil
it is working well for him
he also said that he could really feel a difference in his skin after using the mask
this stuff keeps my skin in check
it also tingles just enough so you know its working
definitely notice the difference it makes
i enjoy it too because it is funny to watch him wear a mask
really sucks up the oil
this is pretty good at taking off makeup.
it's makes my face feel great
i also think that my skin looks brighter
wasn't terribly crazy about how it left my skin feeling a little too oily
it seems to do a good job in getting most makeup off
really special in this effect.
i like this cleanser because it does a very good job of taking off all makeup
it is always in my cabinet
you can always trust this one
i can definitely say i love the smell of this product
worked really well for getting rid of oily forehead during the day i would mix it with my foundation for a light weight kinda of feel
it does a really good job at giving a nice glow without being oily looking
it helps keep my face matte with makeup over it which i really liked as well
i really like it
it really does smooth everything out
i decided to treat my skin to a good primer
it is so so so amazing
was kinda worried because it says matte
trying this product was a very bold move for me.
this stuff smells so good, i could eat it.
feels really nice on my skin
i will definitely use it all
another reason i'm thankful i went with this one is because it's matte not shiny
i am definitely a new glamglow fan
but it really does work!
i always use it now!
all in all i really like it.
this product leaves my skin feeling very nice
i like how this has good for your skin ingredients in it
you kind of have to use a lot to get the 'matte' all over
it really made a difference when applying makeup
it really is for any skin type!
i've still got plenty left so for the price tag i definitely feel like it's worth it
i guess it makes a pretty decent make up base for that reason
the scent lasts all day too which is very nice.
i really like the texture
it feels like a primer going on
my makeup has never looked more amazing.
just falls :/ i love the smell of this as well
it really works deep
can i give this stuff 6 stars?!?
made my skin feel the best it's ever felt
i love to wear this when i am not wearing make up because it absorbs fast
my skin looks so pretty
i get really shiny so fast
im like girrrl how can these ladies be getting bad results????
it makes your skin smell like a cake in my opinion which i feel could be slightly off putting
i really really dislike it
am definitely not going to stay away from this product just because it smells weird
i really like this product
i can totally see this being awesome in the summer after i get a little tanned i don't use foundation
i guess you gotta do a little something for yourself every now
this is everything i wanted it to be
have really liked it
i really love it
i really enjoyed trying this out
would definitely recommend, it does what it says.
the only thing is you need to make sure your fingers are super
this product gives me just that
i also don't feel as though my skin looks as dull
it feels really nice on the skin
constantly read the ingredients before trying anything
this just works well with me
they too strong for me so the guy from skin care suggest this
nothing compares to this because it helped me with my acne
it has literally changed how i think about myself
this stuff is magic.
i now find myself going out without makeup on all the time because my skin looks that good
really made some spots appear on my face
this stuff has really helped my spots
definitely give it a try
this helped me when my skin was going through a tough time with hormonal acne
one of my big toes got a really terrible
very good, i must not forget to use.
this made my skin look so amazing this morning
i really hope this continues to work for me
honestly i could the whole bottle on my face
i mean to the point of i'm always so scared to try a new product because 97% of the time it will cause me to breakout or have super dry skin
i will definitely consider this product
this product has made my skin so beautiful after just 2 weeks i barely recognized my skin
i love how it makes my skin feel.
it just want doing it for me
after i applied caudalie on my face it just feels so smooth
because it's so yummy i was totally using too much at first
there is obviously sorcery at work here
i feel completely comfortable going out in public without makeup
my skin still always looked dull
my face has started to glow so much that i feel like i don't need makeup
people have been commenting on how good my skin looks
for the first time ever people are asking me why my skin looks flawless
it really helped with my texture
i love how my skin looks after use.
i am so confused about the bad reviews because i love this stuff
this serum is the only thing i am doing differently
not very good with a skin care regiment i went out of my comfort zone
follow up we me i would love to know if my review helped you alot
they're really good together
this little guy did the trick
honestly i loved it on myself until i start breaking me out
as i had heard amazing things
i just didn't feel like it was a useful step to add
although everyone has different skin im aware of tht
it already made my skin feel nice
obviously depends what you're using it for
my face is definitely brighter
i swear my face looked better at the very first use
definitely can see the results of brightening
definitely notice happier skin
i actually had someone get angry at me when i made a joke about being "old like us"
she thought i was making fun of her 48 years because i couldn't be older than 30
this is definitely great for those lazy days where you've had your makeup on for too long
really noticed how nice my skin looked after applying it before my makeup
guess you have to test things out for yourself sometimes
'm not a huge fan of that
feel the differencein my skin
plus, it smells so freakin good.
i am so in love with this.
this exfoliator brightens my face as much as it cleansesi really like how my skin feels afterits an amazing productworth to even stock up on
i think this would be great for all skin types
at first i thought this product was just too gentle
my face feels really clean
'm really picky when it comes to cleansers
obviously with a light h
really made a difference for my pores
love the way my skin felt after using it
really gets inside my pores
which i actually liked
that's really one of the best things i've found about this product line
good investment if you ask me!
people have told me so
for something to use everyday try this
i like to try new things
right out of the box i liked it
and the price is definitely right.
this cleanser really did wonders to my skins
i feel it really gets into your pores
i am definitely getting the full bottle this week
i really do like this for cleansing
for something to use everyday try this
i don't feel like this product is very special
something i am still trying to get used to
i love this stuff and need to get more.
i really like this
honestly unless i actively put my nose to the face wash the smell isn't really too noticeable
i really like this.
see myself using it for a really long time
i really notice a difference in my skin
its actually a really good value
it pats in really easily
i'd feel lost without it!
i love the refreshing cool gel feel when i put it on
i am always trying new eye creams
realized just how well it was working
i am sure there must be something better for puffiness
it really makes a big difference.
makes my eyes feel brighter
it still works great because it's not greasy
it has lasted me a really really long time
not a miracle worker, but a good start.
it feels refreshing when you apply it too.
this is one of those which made me feel great!
i hate to think i'm getting old
figured this would be a great eye cream to try
if you're really dark under the eyes
now i might buy a serum for my whole face because this worked so well
i actually think i look weird whenever they've been covered with makeup
tried it just for fun
i like it a lot
the texture and feel is everything!
i love the way my eyes look with this product
i've tried many products, nothing really helped.
i kept getting "wow
you look really tired"
"are you not feeling well?"
i hate that i loved this product so much.
of course loved it so much i wanted to buy it
my eyes do look a whole lot better
i am 57 & trying to stay looking younger!
well for me, this is it.
it didn't feel most riding or cooling
i take really good care of my skin
have tried a lot of good eye creams
few i really liked though.
this stuff feels nice
my eye area is truly smoother
just moisturizer for my whole face
'm already seeing lines
my eyes seriously look like a kid again!
so that was cool too
i can tell you that i definitely look more awake in the morning
eye skin does not feel tight at all just smooth
i know it sounds odd
one night i was looking at my eyes under some really bright
i really noticed a difference
just get this: it really works
your eyes we are talking about
i love how this cream feels
i think i need it because my skin just soaks it up
i find that i've been using it after work when my eyes are super tired
my skin got use to it
i will definitely keep using this product.
now i know why all those ladies in paris look so good
she also made my day by telling me how beautiful my skin was
tired you're just not going to feel real great about the way you look
yes, it is made to use around the whole eye area.
i think is really important in an eye product
i still haven't found the perfect eye cream that really shows results
this does give a little lift when i use it which is nice
maybe even my big cheeks
all i can say is it's got a really nice texture
people told me i looked rested or "really good"
i love the feel of it
that's just what i've been told over
people at work would always ask me if i was tired all the time
every time i use this balm i always get compliments on my skin
it really makes my skin feel great.
he thinks it gives good moisture to him
i don't really have a problem with dark circles
it makes everything so smooth.
i always have trouble getting my foundation to stay flawless even if it looks great when i first apply it
i wanted to make it work so badly because i wanted that dewy glow
what really sold me was realizing how smooth
feel great about how my skin looks
we need all the moisture we can get
i don't think there is anything better really.
i think it really depends on your skin type
for someone like me who has normal skin
it really does brighten
i really love this moisturizer
my face also looks
when i do it's really amazing
my skin looks like a dream.
every client i use it on comments on how good their skin looks
really helps makeup last all day
personally i was hoarding this for my especially tired looking days
today i was told i looked really healthy.
i definitely feel it improves the appearance
it really does tighten the skin.
my skin hasn't look this good in years
the effect is so good that i can get away with it
i do use this stuff
especially when i use it with my clarins foundation
i hate when you find a great moisturizer
it really does transform your face in minutes
i'll certainly say it's great on puffy morning eyes
one beauty product i always like trying are primers
i love how this makes my skin feel
this just adds a little extra something that's hard to describe
it just made everything look... even.
wow i am really loving the look it gives my skin
this stuff is just so yummy!
it also makes my skin feel amazing
wasn't really surprised that i feel in love with this one
it really does what it says -- instantly moisturizes
i think that method really helps to rejuvenate the skin
i literally sigh when i put it on because it feels so good
it really does just make you look great!
i feel sorry for the pople that didnt like this
at "over 50" i think i'm doing pretty great
i really love this product.
told me how much she loved the product
my skin still feels great by the end of the day
makes my skin feel healthy-- a great work hour pick me up when starbucks is too far
i really do like this product
this stuff is light
for my skin it really is an amazing pick me up
i like the way it feels under my makeup as a primer
it just give that nice little face lift.
i would just like to say this stuff is amazing!
i wasn't sure i liked it at first
i always wanted to try clarins
my skin has never looked or behaved so well in my life
i feel like it does tighten my face
i really enjoy this moisturizer.
thought it would be great to test out
it definitely does what it says it does
i could feel me skin tightening
it makes me look younger
not sure if this "brightens"
it has made my winter skin feel like its just had a drink of water
i liked it very much
i definitely recommend it.
i really like it
really didn't think this stuff was for me
a night so it helps a lot)
never used a product quite like this.
it's nice when you need a little lift
my face actually feels amazing for the first time in 15 years of suffering with acne
this really works for combination
see how i like it
within just 24 hours it has done great things for me
i really love it
i've always had issues with pores
you have to really use it everyday tho to see the results
i never really got around to using it
i just got around to trying it
i gave it 4 stars because it really dried my skin out
it really works well for me
i work hard to keep this product only on my t-zone because it is wayyy to harsh for other parts of my face
the only downside is that if you get any in your eyes it stings pretty bad
if i stop using it i definitely notice a difference in the condition of my skin
do not get it near your eyes as it does sting very badly
it hasn't really helped with my acne problems
it stings soooo badly when it gets into your eyes
i still love the product
the only thing i dislike about it is that it foams up quite a bit
now after accutane i really enjoy this product
what a great way to try the whole line before having to commit to each product
my face definitely feels clean after using this product
some how this stuff gets in
i quite like it
i love the way it makes my skin feel after washing--very tight
it works really well with my clarisonic
i love why my face felt after using this
this past week i haven't been eating very good like i normally do
i honestly have never found a product that works this good
my face feels really clean after using it
i would definitely recommend it!
for my type of skin it works just fine
it is not overdrying and my face feels clean.
i hope i get good results with it as well
i still love it
it really didnt at all
i feel like i can actually feel it clean my skin.
so be sure to have a good moisturizer
i can really feel it cleaning deep in my pores.
he said, "mom, my face is pretty now."

really does the job
i felt like i still had a residue on my face
i will definitely listen

just make sure not to get it in your eyes
it definitely does the job

this has definitely helped
i found it refreshing actually
this product works really well for me!
you definitely get a nice glow to your face as well
i've gotten a lot of compliments on my skin
it feels a bit greasy, but works really well.
i can definitely see the difference
i really love it
it really works because it controls oil on my face so well that my face is clean
i do not think it really can help me tightening my pores

with it helping with heat it helps to smooth my skin as well not dissapointed with this purchase at all
we always have some on h
its really a skin saver
the sun is very strong during the day time so this item is really needed during the night
it did not feel greasy
thought i did not like the texture of the gel at first
this was something that i could put on my face without an awful

i am sure i will find another way to enjoy the benefits of this good product

i burned my face really badly
i really like this as a night time lotion for my face
it works for me!
this provides exactly that and i am a big fan!
he was really reluctant to use "girly stuff
they recommended this stuff
over father's day i got another really terrible burn
throw myself on the ground like a toddler if they ever discontinue this stuff
feels good when you put it on
for really really bad burns this helps only with the pain
this gel really works
it really did heal the burn i had on my shoulders really quickly
i would be totally comfortable using this on my face
this stuff is so amazing
no matter how much sun screen i put on there always seems to be a spot missed- you need this
this is definitely a keeper
i know i'm not going to peel now which is good because i was worried about my skin being a wreck for prom
this product really helped when i got sunburned really badly while swimming a 15k
glad i picked this stuff up!
not only does it make my skin feel instantly better
sometimes it feels like i just step into a nice cool breeze
i guess some water got on my face
i really liked this product.
i knew downtown disney sephora would have just the right thing
even straight off the counter is had a nice refreshing feel
would definitely recommend to anyone.
the sweet guy working there gave me this
i also really enjoy the scent, it's very yummy.
it's great products like this that keep me being a devotee to the korres line
really love this cream.
i happen to like the scent, too.
this definitely does the trick
this has done a good job so far of making my skin feel very soft
i've tried just about everything
which i thought was ok
i can tell my skin is a lot softer when i use it!
i really love this moisturizer
i really liked how my skin absorbed it
really recommend this product !
i really love this cream.
i really like the scent as well
beautiful my skin felt when i woke up so extra work in the application seems worthwhile
i've found this winter it is just not doing the job
as i think it would feel too heavy with my makeup
love everything about it!
this stuff works miracles
don't feel like my face will crack if i smile
the most amazing thing is happening
it is definitely my go-to moisturizer
i always like to try other products out of curiosity
i've felt that it never quite got to where it was most needed
i really love this cream.
really good base for the foundation since it didn't show my flaky skin during the winter
does all the hard work without feeling like a mask
i definitely would recommend to anybody.
this stuff is really good
my mother always stressed taking care of my skin.
this does an okay/good job of that

we just love it
he smells masculine now uhmm so good
he loves this product
s are always so rough
he actually loves it
i both love the smell too
he loves this product
this lotion is for guys guy !
it really does have a cooling sensation
he says this lotion is really good for him in the summer after working in the garden
he said it's especially kind to his knees
which is a very bad habit
the other neat thing about this is that my husb
light enough just for me to smell when we cuddle.
since we bought this lotion he is itching a lot less
like most men he has that great skin where he can use this for body
very light consistency and absorbs really well.
he and i both love the smell.
he said he likes that it is lightweight
my girl much prefers that when i'm not off doing those sorts of things that i smell
has had a difficult time finding a good body moisturizer that has a light feel
so the scent of this product was really appreciated

it really has never looked better texture wise.
citrus smell- someone else here said it's relaxing
feel on my face
i really see the difference
i love the way this cream makes my skin feel.
feels so amazing in the morning now
i think i have finally found a great night moisturizer
i get many compliments on my skin
feel this product has helped keep me from over-aging

i did see a difference in how my skin felt
when youre at the end of the tube its very hard to get all of it out
really makes my skin feel great
works really well and my face always feels soft.
i feel good knowing that this moisturizer has spf
although it does have that greasy feel when you first put it on
feel good about my skin
i never knew that a moisturize can do this much for my skin
you have to rub it in quite a bit
it really helped my dryness make a quick recovery
i remember not liking it because of breakouts
it's not the best match since its pretty thick
does feel a bit heavy on my face
to let it really soak in
i would definitely recommend it
the not so young
i love this because it really helped my overly stressed skin after exposure to the sun this summer
i love how the products work together to make my skin look
feel like a woman's 15 years younger
so many that i tried felt really heavy or greasy or just weird on my skin
its nice and light and i actually use it.
i don't feel like it has made me breakout or feels heavy
i would definitely say that this absorbs quickly into the skin
i don't think i've ever been sad for long when applying this moisturizer
i really like this moisturizer !!
this stuff keeps me protected
i feel my complexion has really improved since using it
still love the way it makes my skin look
know i'm doing the right thing for my skin
this has really come in h
my makeup has never looked so good
think it may be helping my acne as well
i like how it feels going on.
i like the way it makes my skin look.
i like the way it makes my skin feel.
not consistently or offensively
i love how this stuff seems to balance out
i feel it is because i use this product everyday
loved how my skin felt after
don't really see it improving my skin quality to any degree
i also thought my sample smelled a little weird
i've never felt that this made my skin greasy
not only does it make my skin feel great
i feel like it brightens up my face
i wanted something that was going to actually help brighten
you get a lot in the bottle
it took me a while to really like this cleanser.
i always come back to this cleanser.
love the feeling way my skin feels
i liked it well enough
you can feel a truly deep clean
i wanted to start being really gentle
im just mad at myself why didnt i buy it right away
it takes very little product to get your face clean
trust me when i say that this cleanser is amazing
it feels so nice
definitely helps with breakouts i sometimes get from make up
i really love the smell of this product- it's light
i feel it does a very good job of removing makeup
i really like how clean my face is
takes just a little to wash your whole face
i think for anyone with normal or especially combo skin would adore this
not sure why b/c it's really very good
i just got it agaiin
it's still really good
it cleans my skin really well
i then needed a product for everyday to keep my skin in good condition
i love this whole line really
only really need this
the way it makes my skin feel
he loves it too

this is the only one that i really like
at 43 i don't think my skin has looked better
is always telling me how pretty my skin looks
which i think is the real test
very dry this change the way my face look don't need a lot of make up it changed my skin for ever
i really liked this face wash.
this is not really for you
really do like it
people constantly think i am only 40
you really need to consistently use the product every night
your skin really does change when you use it.
what i really hate is that because i am a mature woman
getting kind of sick of it.
is not a product guy
he loves this stuff
i think it really makes a difference to the condition of my skin
he said its a good product for him.
i told her just to pick something
this is what she got me
ever since i tried it, i loved it too!
the scent has a refreshing feeling like you are applying something good on your face
i take great care of my skin because age is just a number
you skin is something you have control of
i myself think it's a better product
he likes it a lot because it smells nice
i love the way it makes my skin feel
the cream seems really nice otherwise
i feel like i'm doing something good for my skin
my skin is always so soft that i find myself just feeling my cheeks sometimes
it might feel heavy when you put it on
just leaves my skin looking young
i love the way it feels on my face
i really needed a do-it-all product
makes my skin feel amazing
really do love this- goes on smoothkeeps hydratednoticable texture improvementthe ony thing i wish
the make up/foundation doesn't really smooth over it as well as i'd like
which is pretty amazing too
i decided to try this moisturizer because i am seeing more fine lines
she was so right
you can see it pretty much right away
i love the way my skin looks in the morning
i still love the way my face felt when i put this on
my gal said my skin looked great
'm trying to just use it at night
it seems to brighten my eyes up quite a bit
really bad dark circles
the skin around my eyes is definitely brighter
i think it has done a good job.
i would definitely recommend!
this works really well
it does its job pretty well
i literally get excited to use this every morning when i put my makeup on
obviously there's no such thing as magic
i really like it.
i will see- i might go back to dermadoctor- it gives me a better feel
i think these help
i really do like this stuff
feel like this really works
i always make sure i've got it on.
i definitely recommend it.
lifted like i had a really good night's sleep
this eye cream feels good going on
i could not find anything that was as wonderful as this
have really had a hard time finding an eye cream that's hydrating enough
pretty sure dark circles are just meant to be covered up
really don't see a difference
this definitely does what it says!
this is so nice to use that i have enjoyed using it am
i really love it
i never thought i really needed it because i still felt like my face is still pretty young looking
but i really like what it's done to my eyes.
love the way it feels going on!
talked about how much we loved this
it really works on dark circles
especially those who are just starting to see fine lines
how i feel safe about putting everywhere in my eye area
i feel myself wanting to try something new
it really helps with the dark circles under my eyes
which is what i really needed
i really like it
the things i like about it are
really does seem to reduce my fine lines
too bad, as it is a very good product.
i really like it as an under eye moisturizer
whenever i cry my eyes start to form a weird texture around my eyes
finding the right eye cream can definitely take a few tries
definitely not as much as i want it to
this is the only eye cream that actually works for me
although i dislike the price i always seem to come back to this product
hope you listen here or you will miss the mark of a very important eye cream
how do we look our best at any age?
i always get compliments when i use it.
i honestly forgot all about the eczema around my eyes because it was completely gone after about two weeks
it's also really cooling
finally i found a great product that works to help me to reduce dark circles
i do think my eyes look good since i started using this
my eye area definitely does not look as lined as before i started to use it
for my purpose i've found it to work really well
this is the third time i am buying this product so obviously i like it
it seems like a waist of a whole application
it just keeps on happening
everyone thinks i look 25
feels nice going on
not even using concealer anymore which is unbelievable for me
this product definitely gives me an all around brightening to the the undereye area
i really do like that it isn't greasy
it is definitely pricey
it feels nice and i have no complaints.
however, i do like it, it feels refreshing.
this one really works!!!
i really like the eye cream
it feels nice and i use it day and night......
it really has helped a lot with my dark circles.
i needed a new cream becuase i was getting really bad under eye circles
this product really helps in that area
i keep doing it because it works
i really believe my skin looks great around my eyes
it really feels good on the eye area
love the way the skin around my eyes feels after using this product
it works really well on my dark circles
you can really feel it sinking in
i actually had someone tell me that i looked more like a twenty-something-year-old
i can feel it tightening
definitely give this product a try!
this helps dimishish them a bit
is definitely my new go to
they are always different
i really love the way this smells.
i definitely recommend it
a good way to keep people guessing how old you really are
he really likes this product
he decided he really like the line
he loves this product
we bought it because all the review here says it is a great product
and my boyfriend likes it very much.
feel the difference on my skin for days
i think they are other masks that provide better "wow" results for me
i really think it help me to recover from it.
when you first put it on you feel really really cool tingly feeling which i love
my skin felt amazing after just one use
love the fact it can be used under my eyes too
i love the feel and smell of this mask.
i really like using this on it as it is a gel like consistency
it's a really nice treat every now
bumps because i knew it was gentle
it has a very refreshing feel.
if you want something calming
people are always telling me how nice my skin looks
really would recommend giving this a try.
my face felt nice
i really like it!
i love how it feels on my skin
i feel like i never have to wear much makeup
i always feel so pampered when i use it.
i never used a mask that made me feel more refreshed that this
also leaves my skin feeling baby soft something it hasn't felt like in a few years
this is something you should not pass up especially for the great price
this is a funny little mask
the only other downfall to this product is that it's a bit difficult to get this stuff off
i like the way my skin feels afterwards
i usually use this when i feel like my face needs a pick me up
even my low maintenance guy loved it
i normally have pretty good skin
really that's the word.
i've never had good skin.
one of my favorite products because it really deep cleans my skin
i feel like my face had a big drink of water.
it tasted good believe it or not
i feel that it works
i feel so cool
my skin has never felt so smooth
which i was told would be gentle enough for my skin
it has a refreshing feel while wearing it.
my skin does feel renewed!
i think some people might find it to strong
i've had people comment on how nice my skin looks every time i've used it
really love this mask
this is a great refreshing mask for a pick me up when i feel like my skin needs some attention
definitely a good mask to have to get smooth skin
it's a really nice treat for the skin
love how this mask feels going on!
something i have done for years
found that my overall skin looked more even definetly hydrated
which would make anyone feel good
it is definitely brighter
i already feel a huge difference in my skin
feel like my skin benefits from this attention
you want to get it nice
definitely a must have, especially in winter!
it's got a good tingle on it when you put it on too
you're pretty much guaranteed to get up feeling refreshed
i realize a lot of that is genetics
this whole line makes it so easy for me to decide which one is best for my skin type
i really like this mask.
it's really helping to lessen both of these
this is definitely in that category
this really helps sort it out
i think makes it look younger
i think this is a good cream, just not for me.
this cream has everything you need
it is doing a good job at keeping the wrinkles
this cream is so good, i can not tell you!
it really worked around my mouth!
my daughter who is very picky about her products loves it too
my daughter who is very particular about her face products loves it too
i really like this cream and trust the brand.
it feels do good
i definitely need extra moisture
love my skin, the way it feels, the way it looks.
he said my skin is so dewey
i will definitely buy this product.
it makes your skin feel soooo good
i love the feel on my skin.
bought the whole thing
this is a good moisturizer, but not for me.
i really like it
"what are you using your skin looks amazing?"
she is 34 and i am 39...now that is a compliment.
trying to get that softness back is tough
this stuff for the money is just the best
i think this is my new face cream love.
it totally takes away that tightness feel
really found a difference in lines around my eyes
my skin has never looked or felt better.
my skin feels so cool after i put it on.
i always look forward to washing my face
i felt like my skin could not breath
it just did not feel good
it has truly diminised the fine lines around my eyes that bother me the most
this product helps me remember
makes me skin feel great
i really noticed the other day how good my under eye area looks
i feel the only place that shows my age is my under eye region
now that i've been using this i feel l look younger
i can never find an eye cream that really plumps up the lines as well
i swear i can feel it working
had started to really hate the skin around my eyes
i love this eye cream because it really works for me
love this eye cream, especially for at night.
i imagine this eye cream will be hard to beat
i am a big fan of this eye cream as it does the trick
definitely buy it today!
maybe not, but it is a really good one!
i like it a lot!
being over 50 i am really starting to show signs of aging
i definitely have not noticed any drastic difference which leaves me a bit bummed out
so that is a good thing
getting compliments all the time that i do not look my age
i am constatntly told my eye area looks great
i believe this is what has kept my eyes looking young
i think it's amazing; my eyes feel great!
i really think that i found a great eye cream!
i always wish i had just stuck with what i know works
honestly am noticing a difference
i feel my skin has improved immensely
i can see a real difference
this cream is really really thick.
really like knowing that i'm doing all i can for the thinnest skin on my body
it makes them feel so smooth.
i really like this eye cream.
without a film or greasey feel
no product really is
i definitely recommend this product!
not feeling like they are pulling
this product is definitely doing it's job well.
i really love the stuff!
i love how light it is
the cream goes on around the eyes soakes in very well
my eyes have never looked so well
have looked for a long time for a product that really works
it feels so good when i put it on
i really like this product.
it's really working for the first lines
i can really see a difference in the fine lines around my eyes
it feels great when you put it on
is a great pick-up for those mornings when you're a little over-tired
i only use it at night but it is really nice.
i really think this is the best one so far
this is an eye cream that really works!
i love how you need just a little product to feel the difference in your skin
i also think it's helping with my breakouts!
it has taken me forever to find a moisturizer that i love
it's a bit weird at first
i like the product now my face feels nice
trying to find stuff that has good value
it goes on like a dream
i noticed results pretty much right away
i love this moisturizer so very much.
i love the way it works
i know that sounds weird
definitely not the case
give it a try its helped me immensely this winter
nothing i've ever felt in a moisturizer before
because of the consistency i think
feel the difference when i stop wearing
i love this stuff, i feel like it really hydrates
which is really strange
it smells a little weird at first
my skin just feel really smooth
this moisturizer felt really nice when touching it
i really enjoy this moisturizer.
i really like this!
thank you so much to my local sephora skin care beauty advisor she works at the one in culver city
this mask has really helped my skin.
the way it feels on my skin
a lot of people says the smell is awful
i really love this product as a day
i really like the smell
we have a pretty similar skin type
i really like this cream.
it makes my skin feel very nice
it worked really well
i am in love with this stuff.
makes it feel like a baby's bottom
would definitely recommend for both off
my skin type is one of the weird ones.
it works really well with my skin
for me it was just ok
i feel like it kind of "layers" on top of my face
it does look very good with a liquid foundation though
it has done wonders for my skin
the texture/ feeling after application was a deal breaker for me
i always love clinique's eye products
"we just have to know what you use around your eyes
definitely saw the difference when i did
i swear it makes my make up look better
i can definitely see it firming up too
this really helps to tighten that up!
i am just like you
after reading the reviews i wondered if it was going to be as good as they said
when the reviews are too good it makes one wonder
it really is that good
i really love this product.
this really does a good job keeping my eye area smooth
i really like this eye cream.
truly i see a huge difference when i don't use it
i really love this eye cream.
it feels really nice.
i definitely see improvements in lines
everyone asks me about my eyes
why they looks so great
i'd say this is a good one to start with
your lips always feel
other good stuff in it
t's a big climate change for me
when i do it really helps smooth out the lips
it really works like a miracle
i really like the texture
the way this one feels around my eyes
i think i tried everything
my eyes haven't look this good in years
this cream really helped to get rid of them
it really is amazing stuff.
i can see a difference in my laugh lines
feel it has good coverage
it certainly makes me look
i 'm not sure about it's firming abilities
lips feel so good
i personally use it as a night cream.
learn a lot from the makeup artists who work with me
i really don't like hope in a jar
make sure to pat it on
i think hope in a tube keeps my eye
people often tell me my skin looks great
i definitely see a difference
tell all my friends about this.
it is the only one that i have found that really hydrates under my eyes
i really love it
under my eyes was getting very papery so the light cream i was using just wasn't working anymore
it really makes both look better instantly
this is what i expect when i use it at night to get a nice skin barrier
this stuff works wonders!
the tube is great too since its easy to put exactly the amount you want to use right on your finger tip
cuz i always get too much
other good stuff in it
i think that says it all.
this is not really a "treatment"
it really works after about a week
you can feel the moisture if i make sense
relatives commented "what are you doing to your skin this is the best it has ever looked"
strangers tell me that my skin is so great i look 15 years younger than i am
it feels so good going on
since using this i get compliments all the time about how great my skin looks: not to dry
it really does give you just the right amount of moisture
it is definitely a staple
it makes my face feel so clean.
it turns out i really like this!
felt like everything made my skin worse
it find it does the job perfectly
i make sure to wash at night as well
whenever i'm at the clinique counter the sas always give me loud compliments about my great skin
i've worked hard to take good care of my skin throughout my life
trust me i am in the 50s now my skin is good .
it is definitely a must for me
i always have a clean feeling afterwards
just the after feeling is different
it is working well for me
this soap only does good things to it
i always get comments about how good
my face does not feel clean without it
my face always feels fresh afterwards.
i really like this soap/ it does not foam too much
i always try something different
i still have a really good amount left
because it just got to be messy for me
obviously follow with moisturizer
i like it a lot because it get the make up off
i think the soap bar is something works better for me
i think it is really good
so many people comment on how nice my skin is
i really like it!
this really seemed to do the trick to help manage my extremely oily
so because this bar is so huge
it makes my face feel very clean
i think i will always use it
feel good and it like look nice too
i really like it!
everyone tells me i have the most beautiful skin.
that i really like
he loves the stuff
because it does work good for my eye makeup as well
it definitely helped me clear out my acne
when you use it with the other two 3 step products your skin will feel awesome
the whole acne line actually.
it's the only thing i have found that really helps my skin
it really really dried out my face
it feels especially good right after a long workout makes your face feel totally refreshed
i recommend this product to everybody!
my skin is so nice now!
i every time i try something different
i wanted to review it here as well
i found this to be very good for using after washing my face
i am very satisfied with everything i have tried from clinique that is suited for my oily skin type
i got this for my boyfriend who has very large pores
i like this a lot.
i originally bought this product a couple years back when i was having a really terrible time with my skin always seeming super dry
it's great for guys that just want a moisturizer without a bunch of added ingredients
to try since taking care of his skin is important to me
i’m finally convincing him that these products really do make a difference in how his skin feels
didn’t really impress him very much
he said it felt nice on his skin
he said this is not a bad moisturizer
he really likes it
his skin looks really amazing now
i do a lot of traveling
especially since i still love doing a smoky eye
i think this is really good.
i always use it with a bit of moistureizer
if you like clinique you will definitely like this
it works for me
which i am sure works just as well
i feel like my make up goes well over at first
the best part for me was that it does open my eyes up a little bit
it really does work
i must really like it.
i appreciate what it does do as i feel it does it well
it does feel really good
i am not really sure if this lifts my under-eyes or keeps the skin particularly taught
not really meant for under-eye usage
i love how you really only have to use a very small amount to get coverage
i feel like i couldnt go a day without it
my eyes do not look old
is hard to get out of it
always have it on h
people always remark about how young i look.
seems to be doing the job
my eye wrinkles are definitely looking better
i really like this product
the skin around my eyes is definitely changed
i'll keep using this as it makes my eyes look
it really seems to smooth out the fine lines by my eyes
am really a fan now
i always look like i've had a good nights sleep
it keeps my eyes from looking as tired as i often feel
which is really the reason for eye cream
it is very good and i use it twice a day.
i really think it helps keep the area around my eyes softer
i've always really liked them
it really brightens the area around my eyes
i really like this cream.
it really keeps eyes looking younger
he uses it every night and loves it.
he says it really makes a huge difference.
he loves everything about it.
he hated breakouts of any kind
all guys should have this stuff
i really like this product from clinique
whole is too big which makes it really easy to spill
that really great tingle feeling when you're done
they're pretty much solid on everything they have banged out
guess what that first step is, homegirls?!
not the tight feeling this does leave
just purchased this stuff
myself that all wear makeup
even without it feels just as good
you really need very little product to get results
when i was it off i do feel an odd feeling on my skin
i really like this cleanser.
i really love this cleanser.
after using this i can truly feel my face getting clean
has done wonders for my face
we all love it
my face always feels fresh
i love how my face feels so clean
i put on a lot of makeup everyday
its been very hard to find a product that not only gets all the oil/makeup off my face
would definitely recommend to everyone else!
it really gets everything off.
i love this product and always return to it!
always go back to clinique for my skin care
it works great but i feel too dry after using it.
feels like it does a thorough job of getting everything off
you don't need much as it spreads really nicely
this cleanser actually helps with it a lot
you feel your face nice
it is pretty much the only face cleanser i really trust to do a good job
it leaves my face feeling really clean
it cleans your face really well
it also works really well with my clarisonic.
i really like this scrub for my skin.
i love this stuff so much!
always come to this because it works
i feel like this product really cleans my whole face
breaks down makeup really well
i really love this product.
which i am sure isn't good for your skin
never makes my skin feel tight
every time i use it i think my love for it grows
it takes of all of my makeup really easily
i always come back to clinique's all about eyes
that's a good thing though.
i wear quite a lot
will definitely continue doing so
i make sure i follow with a good moisturizer to avoid the tight feeling
but for the rest of the face is just great!
i always liked it
it leaves my face feeling really clean
it has a nice texture going on my under eye area
this is definitely it
said i love your eyes
hopefully my review helps you.
i really love it
it also wears really well under makeup
i always seem to come back to this one
it makes me look like i got about 7
it also feels really nice to apply
this stuff is honestly the best eye cream.
for someone who gets very little sleep
decided to use it for my eye bags even though i was really young
i don't even know where i got the idea of starting to use eye cream at such a young age
it really does brighten up my undereye
definitely recommend trying this!
this is a go-to product for me.
i always come back to this eye cream no matter what other eye cream i try
i always come to all about eyes
my eyes always feel fresh
they work well with my skin
i love the feeling - not too greasy.
thought it would be useful for tired mornings with puffy eyes
it does a great job in depuffing the tired under eye bags
my skin feels so good after i massage this in!
i noticed my concealer wasn't sitting as nicely as it had when i had used this
i really notice a difference
this cream feels so nice on right out of the shower
i really like it
i like the way it feels
i definitely like the bit i have
i am always asked what i use
my undereyes love this stuff
i think it really works if you are in your twenties
that's what led me to this little gem
know for sure that it works for me
feel comfortable writing all of this
i am pretty sure that this is the exact same gel cream in the rollerball
i really like this eye cream.
i still love it
nothing has done the trick for me the way this has
goes on really smooth
i really do think it helps with darkness
not sure how well it actually works at removing dark circles
my eyes feel really tired
i really like this eye cream
it just really makes my under eye area look smooth
i love the way this makes my skin feel under my eyes
i always put this eye cream which i always borrow to my mom
i love the way this feels at night
i would say it does a pretty good job
i personally think this is designed for younger skin
i enjoy it a lot
none have done as good a job on my looks in that area
my husband really likes it!
he really likes it
he is super picky and really likes this product.
all guys should try it!
he seems to like it
he likes that there is no fragrance to it
my skin has never felt
love it help me with my dark spots life saver
although he said it felt nice on his skin
good enough for a guy
my guy likes it!
and i like the way it smells!!
it feels good going on
he likes that it makes his face feel smooth!
he said this is a good daily moisture especially for guys like him who wants their skin care to be as simple as possible
he hated breakouts of any kind
simply amazing a must for my everyday life
to try since taking care of his skin is important to me
i’m finally convincing him that these products really do make a difference in how his skin feels
didn’t really impress him very much
he said it felt nice on his skin
he said this is not a bad moisturizer
i think this product has definitely help to balance my tone
my husband likes it because it is not greasy
the two things that matter most to a guy!!
he loves it and uses it every day.
this really helps his face not feel dry
now he makes sure it is always on hand.
i love the way it makes my face feel fresh
he says its really good!
he just loves it
really enjoys the feeling not just on his skin
love the smell and how my face feels afterwards!!
obviously i didn’t read the label well enough because my husb
talked about how he didn’t like the way it felt on his skin
clinique’s products are so good that this would probably work very well for someone with dry skin
it really takes that tired look and banishes it.
it sits really well under makeup
i really like the gel formula
it gets dried out really quick idk how to feel about it real let down
it is a good working moisturizer it gets the job done
i really enjoy this moisturizer as it feels light
this gel really works well!
i can already see a big difference in the way my skin looks
this is really a game changer.
this has really done it for me
this stuff has done wonders for my skin.
never have liked their products
i feel like i have tried them all
not really any smell either which i think is great
i always see people saying great things
thought i'd give this a whirl
live in new york so the winter is really rough for me
i did like both however i am very weird about my face feeling like there is anything on it once it is cleaned before i go to bed
i can definitely see myself using this for a long long time
it makes me skin feel really soft yet is still very light
they weren't kidding when they said dramatically different because that's how my face feels
i just love the way it feels.
its pretty basic which isn't a bad thing
my mom both use it as well
this stuff was great all year because it doesn't feel greasy
<3 worked really well with my combination skin
it sinks in really fast
i feel like it's sitting
it makes my face feel
this truly sinks right into your skin.
i will definitely keep it
i noticed my face wasn't at moisturized as i really wanted it to be
it makes my skin feel suuuper.
hopefully it does for most what it has accomplished for myself
i am in love with this stuff!
my skin just feels like it has the right amount of moisture
it's the first department store moisturizer i have actually liked
i never thought i'd rave like this over a moisturizer
i never feel greasy afterwards
i actually seen a difference so quickly i love it
definitely leaves my skin baby
my skin has never looked this good.
i like how light
i really like this moisturizer.
that seems to be ok
my face is really oily so this mask wasn't really for me
i really like it
even tough i love the smell
it also feels really nice
it felt very cool and smooth going on.
i really think it's helping my dry spots
so of course this would be my dream thing!
because i feel prettier when i use them plain
afterward i asked him if he felt prettier.
he answered, "remarkably so dear, thank you."
it feels so good on my skin it leaves it feeling smoother then a velvet peach lol
it made my skin feel great
i really enjoyed using the mask
i definitely recommend this product.
the effects were quite nice
just be aware it smells like real roses
am very funny about what i put on my skin
it makes my face feel amazing
this made my skin look
was worried when i got it that it might irritate my skin
my skin thanks me for it
i think it smells just fine.
my skin looks good after i use it.
they were pretty obvious.
seriously, i love this thing.
i am definitely buying the 3
honestly the product is so great just close your nose for ten minutes lol
it was so good
plus something else i can't quite name that smells really weird
after applying the face mask you get a nice refreshing feeling
i really can tell a difference!"
not only that it has rose petals which i think is pretty cool
get it and your skin will thank you!
i kinda like that
it really does work
this works wonders for me
i think it works wonderfully to give some life back to my skin
i love everything about it
although i don't really see much of a difference with my acne
not thing like big difference
i love the feeling of my skin
i really love this face mask!
you don't need a whole lot to cover your entire face
i really recommend this face mask.
i don't find that it really helps with my redness
i love the way my skin feels after i use this mask
really massage it in with it when applying
makes your skin feel so good
love the smell and feel of it!
removing it for me makes my skin feel even
it looks like i take 3 years off of my face when i use it because my skin is so bright
don't feel bad about buying this because i also use less makeup when my skin is happy
my skin feels so good
instantly felt my skin just relax
i really love this mask!
i definitely recommend this product
it is the only thing that helps my skin
it is just the right consistency
i do feel like my skin looks a bit brighter when i use this
i also find it sometimes makes my eyes feel a bit watery
smell very good too.will definitely buy again.
seriously this stuff is good.
this has a great smooth even feel to it.
every one i tried made me break out like crazy
i feel good knowing that there are face benefiting ingredients in addition to the spf
i really love it.
neck so you definitely get your money's worth
i would definitely recommend buying it
loved the feeling of this going on my skin!
here i found it
no mask-like feeling at all
we agree that we love the lightness
i really like it
i even look forward to putting it on everyday
i love that you don't need a lot to get great results
i really like this one!
although i do really like absolu also
i really like this moisturizer!
makes my skin feel really smooth
i am definitely hooked!
obviously sunscreen is so good for you too.
my make-up goes on over this very well.
s because i definitely feel the difference on my skin
well i ran out of my stuff
just hate a greasy feel
just makes my skin feel good--
it looks good too
it is definitely my official moisturizer now!
unfortunately it has gotten pretty bad on my face
he really likes it.
i definitely think that it has helped in keeping my skin clear
she was right when she said it would make my skin smoother
even friends have commented on how good my skin looks
im not going to lie his skin is alomost looking healthier than mine
my husband likes this product very much.
secondly he likes the way it makes his skin feel soft
i think he likes how masculine the product is
i mean that my vision is a little blurry because i think a lot of the product is in my eyelashes
felt i needed to with this
it alsmoat gives the feeling like its gonna come off greasy
i will definitely repurchase this product i love it so much
just because it's hard to take everything all at once
the makeup goes off really fast
it does a really nice job of taking off all my makeup
this balm seems to take off my makeup pretty well
you have a lot of product
you do get a lot of product for your money
really helps me get makeup off which helps prevent breakouts which i'm pretty prone too
i feel like i got rid of all my bad decisions in life
this one truly takes off all my makeup
i love how it feels
'm not sure what those people are talking about
this product is so good it gets all my makeup
leaves my skin feeling really nice
makes it sooo easy to take off
this stuff just goes on
it is really a balm
you feel very clean after.
i do like it a lot !
i love this stuff it does a good job taking my make up off
it honestly removes everything on your face quickly
it actually takes everything off
i do really like this
i feel that it does remove makeup very well
it just seems like a hassle to me when makeup wipes do the same job just as well
you get a lot in the container
basically i was a total snob thinking "look at all those people spending more money on the same thing
i am not good at using cleaning oils-they are always in my eyes
i love how it gets ride of all my makeup on my eyes
i am giving it 4 stars because if it gets in your eyes you will have blurry vision for a bit
i love how it feels
okay i actually had a lot of eye makeup on
it took everything off so easy
i would definitely buy the big jar of this :)
mascara off my eyes i feel like i'm just tugging too hard
so, this stuff has been a great help there.
feels so good on your skin
have really been loving this to take off my makeup at the end of the day
at night this stuff worked wonders!
it's really difficult to remove
i always get compliments on my makeup
it makes me feel so pretty.
definitely buy this if you wear lots of waterproof
i am still just as in love with it as always
this stuff is down right amazing!!!!!
thought to check it out myself
my eyes thank me for using this!
really does get off every trace of makeup!!
this stuff is seriously amazing!!!
i love this stuff it takes off all of my makeup.
i feel in love again
what was i doing with my life before this product
there's not really a film just a super healthy softness i'm cryyyyying
n my opinion you really do get your money's worth
this product is definitely one of those.
which is really hard to remove
im still pretty young
have always taken care of my skin
i think eye cream is one of those things where you just have to find something with good ingredients
i really like this product.
i feel my eye are is brighter too!
i hope that makes sense.
especially my laugh lines
can really see a major difference
it really takes care of my eye area.
i like the way this feels on my skin
liked it enough to purchase it
this stuff goes a long way
overall i love this stuff
people were constantly telling me i looked tired everyday i went to work
i really liked it
i really like this eye cream because of its consistency
i really wish it had a nicer price tag, though.
this eye cream works really well for me because it helps clear up some of the white dots i get around my eyes
t's really hard to tell what it really does
i really like the spf it's really great to use during the day
i love the way it feels on my skin
what i like most of all is that it makes the skin under my eyes look just as great as the results i see when i use philosophy- it smooths out the look of fine lines
definitely makes that area look younger.
definitely would recommend this toall my friends
this stuff has everything i wanted in an eye cream
he loves it as well
i really love the murad line
i like how this makes the are under my eyes
it really does make the skin around my eyes seem firmer
i still love it
i love how your eyes look after using this a while
i actually feel the eye area fiirmer
i've really seen the difference
do be careful about getting it in your eyes
my eyes never look tired
it makes my eyes feel so nice
i really like it
you should really give this a try
i like how it helps alot with puffy eyes
then this is a pretty good product
you can feel the tingle of the cream working after you apply it
this is really mild
just got the big bottle.
i wouldn't say its the best but it's pretty good.
face didn't feel too tight afterwards
the smell is a bit too strong for me
i really love this cleanser!
i liked it a lot this summer.
thank you sephora for helping me find it!
it feels really nice when i'm washing my face
just making you feel pure :
it sure gives a luxury touch
i never thought a foam cleanser could be this great
my skin has never felt softer
i love how it feels on my skin
i feel like my skin is healthier thanks to this product
it changes my life i just love ithelps with acne
i love the way how it feels after i use the cleanser
i felt like it wasn't really cleaning my face because the foam disappears really fast after you apply it
does not make my face feel tight after using
this gets the job done
i would definitely recommend!
just like every other thing caudalie makes
i feel it's a great morning routine to freshen
just what i wanted for a cleanser!
it does not do a very good job in taking off makeup
the only negative is it seems to go really fast
i defintiely think a little goes a long way
definitely a buy for me
everything seems to break the bank if it is any good
it does a really good job at cleansing my skin without drying me out
i feel like it cleans my face well
is enough for the whole face
after trying quite a few truly "luxury" skin care br
this has been working quite well for me
it gets the job done
my mom always told me clinique made the best skin care products
he told me that my acne was caused from me washing my face too much
i always get bad break outs when i change products
i really like that it gives a good clean feeling without drying me out
i think i am going to purchase the mild face wash to see if that works better
for most of my life, i've had pretty great skin.
it takes off makeup pretty well
i really enjoy both formulas
this is the only thing that evens out my skin
truly makes me feel comfortable without makeup
maybe the sun had something to do with it
it feel so fresh when you use it
i feel it is very mild
cleans my face really well
i really believe it is because of their line.
using it always make me feel like my face is clean after a face wash
i find just one pump is good for my entire face.
i really like this face wash.
it has definitely helped keep my face clear
i can see the difference in my skin
my skin does not feel tight.
i love how it leaves my skin feeling.
it really made my skin feel great.
which i really like
i love to us this with my clearasonic
i liked the pump
also really good price point
i think this just might be my go-to cleanser when my skin starts acting out
i also like the smell of it
i would definitely recommend it
the product gets the job done
it just feels that it is lacking something
i think this is a great face wash for someone beginning to take care of their skin
so yeah you can be sure it will remove every bit of makeup off your face
i always had bumps
although i normally have pretty good skin with a pimple here
it really helped to fill in my pores
always return to this primer
i makes my make up look so flawless
it also has a great finish even if you aren't wearing foundation
hey guys give this a try.
this stuff is like magic
it really does fill in my pores
it'd be nice to read in these reviews to know the weather of one's environment
the moment you put it on you skin
has to be amazing in order for me to do so
sometimes i feel like it balls up
just as good, maybe?
wanted to really emphasize just how amazing this primer really is
it smells weird at first so that's why i gave it a 4
seriously this stuff i amazing.
real talk, i am in love this primer.
this is obviously pricy
i find that you have to shake it first so that it comes out nice
this is definitely my go to
this stuff made my make up look so smooth
i wasn't very fond of the smell at first
i even like how my skin looks with just this stuff on :
you can literally feel it working right away.
i definitely think it's been controlling my shine
my advice is to give it a try — the beauty of sephora is you can always return it
had a tough time finding a primer that worked for me
i love the way this product makes my skin feel.
it's feels really good in the skin
with this product i feel very comfortable going out wearing only a pore minimizer
this right here did its job i put it on right away didn't see pores very soft to your skin also made my make up look matte
it truly think i see it working over time
i love how it makes my skin feel
how my makeup looks
i did my normal "just how i thought-awful" mirror check
i really love this in combination with my benefit porefessional
it really works for what it's for
i think it works really good.
it kinda smells bad
it seems to give me some brightening
really the only simple
every time i try to switch over to something else my skin gets irritated
i need things that truly help my skin
just work really quick
i find this guy works really well
i don't think this product would really benefit people with dry skin
myself put together has me looking 10 years younger
this stuff balanced my skin like nothing else has
so definitely try this product if you have problematic skin
this product definitely does not
i can really see the difference when i wake up.
otherwise, a really good product.
it has a light feel
which can be very hard on the skin when you are not used to it
definitely does what it says it does
i love this whole line
it works really well on my skin
i didn't feel like that was getting all my makeup off
it works fine for me that way
using this was so comforting
i make sure she's always stocked with this as she is hesitant to spend this much on herself
omly about how good her face smells
will keep doing so
i always come back to this comforting cleanser
i would definitely recommend this product.
it does a pretty good job of removing
this is what got me hooked on really great quality cleansers
will definitely stick with it-especially in the winter months
i liked this product pretty well
it also smells very pretty.
i really like this
love the smell of this stuff!
this is one of the few cleansers i have tried that is really good at cleansing
i can see that my skin is so smooth after just one day
so this works really well.
even though college life got me down
my skin seems to genuinely love this one
i love it but not that makes my skin brighter.
i'll definitely keep using this!
i guess this is the brightening effect?
it does improve the look of my skin
i really enjoy this product!
feel free to check it out if you want to see this stuff in action
people at work keep telling me how "refreshed" i look
then they make akward comments about how i look good
or really maybe specifically my overuse of it
i can tell a difference in my dark spots
someone at sephora helped me find this
i think i have found it
it has really made a difference in my complexion
i think with time
people tell me i look brighter
this stuff actually works
does not make my face feel greasy like some moisterizers do
i felt like i'd gotten to the point of getting my skin looking good
it is a really good product, tho.
this product really has done what it claims to do
i wanted something to brighten both my face
i see my skin really brighten
this stuff has really improved my skin
it is so nice to be able to wear something that has is not fragrance free
like how my face feels with it on
which i really appreciate that this br
feel like i should tell everybody how fantastic this makes my skin look
really does give me a brighter
it is really light
the dispenser is what got it a 4/5 for me.
i do think it makes my skin brighter when i use it
it really does smooth out my face.
always loved the benefit
i definitely recommend this for anybody who is looking to improve the feeling of their skin
it really does seem to have lightened my under
this seems to work well for me
had a lot of acne scars that made me sad
i think it's a great product for young women to use for their skin
the smell is nice but doesn't last very long.
i really the results.
i don't have to wear makeup if i don't feel like it because this has made my skin look that good
feel as good as if i were wearing it
"i still don't think this serves as a good primer though
thank you korres- i really cant say enough great things about your products
it makes me want to look at the mirror every day
not see a tired person
can see a lot of difference
i guess they work well together
i really feel like it has helped my dark circles
very little faith in skin care products
i like the way it feels
i really took a good look in the mirror
this is definitely one i'll keep buying
i initially wanted something that will really nourish my skin
this stuff has put an end to those things though
i definitely recommend it

i love how my skin feels after i use it!
i really like it
it makes my skin feel moisture， match the price！
feels really nice on your skin

this works so well, i use it everyday.
my skins never looked
i really enjoyed using this moisturizer every day under my makeup
felt and looked great, would purchase again!
we got what we wanted
lancôme has always been my go-to moisturizer.
overall feels really good going on
i think it works well for winter and summer.
since i have been getting this i have received many compliments on how nice my skin is
my son's teacher told me my skin is so nice i look like i am 12
just the fact that this had 30 spf was appealing to me
really does help those fine lines
i really liked this product over the winter to apply to my face
i can definitely notice the difference between this cream

its so good that my boyfriend is using it everyday too
makes my skin look really good
i really love this product
like the multi-vitimins are doing its magic mojo thing
my mother has always been picky about anything
everything especially anything she puts on her skin
everything this brand makes just works for me.
the consistency makes you think it will feel greasy
it really does work well
it definately works very well you just need to use it consistently for a couple weeks :
it goes on like primers and feels really smooth.
it really helps when you are breaking out
this stuff actually works!
it is definitely helping my skin
just love this stuff.
i've had problem skin my whole life
'm not sure what it is about this formula that's so different
i think it has really been helping to reduce blemishes
i really do love it
i've had really bad skin for over 20 years

i love the texture of it too!
started thinking it wasn't working that great anymore
thank you so much!
it feels so good to feel acne scar free
this stuff has a odd consistency to it though.
this stuff is pretty expensive
so just think... this one is 1.7 oz.
so it will last a really really long time.
makes your foundation go on so smooth
this product really works.
yes it is great but really ?
feels like it would be greasy
it never feels heavy or greasy, amazing stuff!
i can definitely see the difference whenever i wear this
definitely pick this up
it never leaves me feeling greasy
i really like the feel
going through hormone change you will see amazing results with absolue
skin feel really better
if my skin looks this good after only a week of use
am seeing a lot of things i don't like
it really does a great job with keeping the wrinkles at bay
i really like rejuvine better
great if you really want to zap those lines
you can see and feel the difference.
even he likes the smell
so don't feel bad
this is the only cream that really works for her
everybody thinks she is 58
this makes my skin feel so good!
my face still feels nice
definitely recommend using it.
can speak only good things for every product
love the way my skins feels/looks
it is very soothing and i can tell it is working.
the cream is definitely pricey
my eyes started to feel the relief

this stuff is so smooth
reaaaallly liked it it made my skin so nice
this is way nicer it also feels nice to put on haha so smooth
love the consistency too!
you don't need a whole lot
so saying "burned my eyes" isn't really fair.
it burns pretty bad if you get in your eyes.
honestly i really disliked this compared to the balm version
but i really love this product!
stings my eyes really bad.
i really like this product it leaves my skin feeling great
not so bad but the smell was not so good
i really like this
it really helped my skin clear up because i didn't realize that just because i washed my face each night
it hurts really bad
it really helps get all my makeup off
my skin definitely looks better for it
i liked it a lot
it gets the job done
my skin does look a lot better where i am able to use it
i think it does a great job of removing face makeup
after 3 days people said how great my face
someone asked what i used to have such a great glow
i would definitely recommend this product!
it works well for me
the sephora rep that helped me pick it out said it would work as an eye makeup remover as well
helps my skin stay young looking
t's quite ok for me
not really off your eyes
i love this moisturizer it feels so good on my face
it feels so good
so will you when you feel how soft your face

i can literally feel my skin drinking it up!
i really love this product.
she asked "what are you doing to your skin?
it smells so pretty
i feel like using this definitely evens out my skin
i really love this product.
i really love the smell of it as well.
i just don't see a lot of difference in terms of moisturizer with other br
i feel like i can smile
i buy it just because it makes you feel pretty
it works really well
i love everything about it
we baby our skin out here
i think the product is really doing what it says it does
stop using it all together cause i felt it was to strong
makes my skin feel amazing as soon as i put it on
love everything about this..smell the feel.
makes my face feel so smooth
i love the feel of this cream it feels so luxourious on my skin
okay now i sound like i represent this cream
definitely not for day use
i feel i have to use a lot of the product to get the best results
that is always a bit of a turn off.
my skin looks and feels so good.
i really see a difference
this will really help you
i can feel a difference even after a couple of days
i just turned 50 and have always had good skin.
i just love the feel
makes my skin feel good
people have commented how good my skin looks since using it
it just makes my eyes feel good
hopefully it is doing what it's supposed to do in regards to age-prevention
i love how this makes my skin feel so much that sometimes i cheat
it is great stuff for the character lines around my eyes
obviously i haven't been very quick to start using them
it works for me so well.
i want to second-guess myself
i like the feel of it
think it will be good for summer too.
i really like how it feels
i still love it
how it feels going on
whenver i got tired of looking at the same bottle
i got it and guess what- i love it!
us older glams need all the moisture we can get
my complexion simply looks good.
i love this enough that i felt i should let others know how great it is
i definitely recommend this.
this stuff helps my dark circles
feels so freaking good on my face
use this at night because it's really really thick
this stuff really works!
my eyes feel really good after using this
my eyes look good in the morning
i love when i look like i'm not wearing makeup.
it was really aging me.
it really works well
i do like that it brightens my eyes in the am.
great product for winter, not sure about summer.
it is definitely greasy
really focus on them
this cream is definitely helping me still pass for 30 yay
something to keep in mind
i feel like i'm looking my age
indeed it is pricey, but it really works.
i decided to try this out when i began to get what i think we're stress/tired wrinkles under my eyes
im having a really great experience with it
i feel like i really see a difference as soon as i put it on- i also think it helps with brightening the eye area along with just firming my creases
they really stayed looking the same
i like it a lot
she loves using this stuff
she saw results pretty fast!
consistency of the product for sure
it's working so good on me!
i always had fine lines really pronounces dark circles
this is definitely intense
i really like this eye cream.
it will make you feel greasy
i really like this cream
i really appreciate the price
this is really more than amazing actually because it worked immediately
nothing has helped me like this product
love it definitely going to purchase
no matter what i tried nothing worked to hydrate my under eye area
i shall say that this creme is very good product
i am 43 and my tired eyes was telling on me.
i really wanted to find something that would really deal with my under eye wrinkles
never seen something work like this!
the packaging is also really pretty.
weird i know, but it works!
this cream just feels really nice
one wipe really goes a long way
t's great for someone who wears more makeup
am too tired to do the whole cleansing routine in the am
they are so refreshing
my face feels clean and it smells nice too!
that said, i love how great they work.
so many others must agree how fabulous they are
is that i don't always find it takes all the makeup off
these are also great for gym or when you are too tired to actually wash your face
can't really feel it is actually cleansing all of my makeup
does a good job at taking makeup off.
probably a good face scrub
just one sheet does an phenomenal job of thoroughly cleaning your face without making it feel too dry or tight
they really get the makeup off well for me
i am so happy i didn't give up on finding the perfect cleansing wipe
take off all of my makeup really fast
it makes my face feel so clean afterwards
it also make my face feel very fresh
they are really good
these are very nice
it cleans really well and leaves no film behind.
these are great for camping or for those nights i'm too tired to go through my whole cleansing routine
also great if you simply want to freshen up.
do a great job of getting the make-up off
they do a good job of removing makeup
they are great to freshen up when you travel too
i would definitely recommend them.
my skin felt really clean
i am definitely going to buy the bottle of pureness as well as restock on these travel sheets
they really are a timesaver.
they make me feel clean
are so easy to use that i buy them anyway-- hopefully no one will find out how much i spend on stuff like this
they do a great job of thoroughly removing all my foundation
i love these little things to death!
i like that it feels really fresh
do a great job of not only removing makeup
was only too happy to go back to these amazing cleansing sheets
what seems like every
you get a lot for your money
this is actually really great!
it really helps keep you matte
feels very refreshing going on
this feels so good going on.
so on myself works like a dream
i love how this is so light
it definitely keeps you matte
this has light feel on my skin
i really love how the moisturizer makes my skin feel
shiseido has always had a good rep from what i hear
it really helps with makeup application
combination skin this would seem to be a good fit
it really helps control shine.
i can tell a huge difference in my skin
it feels very soothing when you apply it
it really does its job of mattifying
this moisturizer really does what it says it does
which is what a lot of shiseido products do
all three products together have done wonders for my skin
i feel fresh for the whole day
put on makeup and good to go all day.
they work perfectly together.
feel that it helps with the oil a little.
i feel very comfortable
this product keeps me matte the whole day
it does not feel heavy at all.
there was no new pimple saying good morning
i hate the heavy feel on my face
i think that it is great both for people who are prone to breakouts
especially i have to work in the office for the whole day
i also really love how a little truly goes along way
i really like this for the summertime
i really like it.
i really like it!
it makes my skin really smooth afterwards
compliments from guys too
my boyfriend's mom just so happened to get him one
it really helps with the shine
really love the whole purness line from shiseido
it makes me feel like i am using way too much
it just makes my face feel fresh
i definitely recommend trying this out
i definitely don't think that's a bad thing
i really do like this
my skin is looking so nice that im purchasing my second bottle it feels lightweight
i think it sinks in pretty fast
feels like nothing is on my skin
love the way my skin feels
i dont even use a primer with this because i feel it also holds my makeup so well
it is really good to apply
it is so lightweight if feels like i'm wearing nothing
you don't need a lot to cover your face/neck as it is really light
i tend to come back to this moisturizer whenever i try a new one because it's really just that good
pretty much my whole life
this cream does everything as it says
i always get compliments about how great my skin looks
am always on the lookout for a good moisturizer that won't cost me an arm
i do feel like my skin is a lot softer after
always look for cream that is pure
you should definitely give this a try if you have sensitive skin
this product worked really well with my skin type
the smell is pretty good too.
i like the way it feel on my skin
it's really refreshing too.
i think i made a good choice.
and most of all, it smells sooooo nice!!!
i really like this gel moisterizer.
it goes on very cool
i love how light this feels
my skin felt like it could breathe -- seriously!
it felt so good.
the way it makes my skin feel after
and it works really well with my face wash.
it's very light and feels cool on your face.
it actually feels good putting it on.
it feels good going on
that's all it really does
dont feel its working
this is really work for me
i like how smooth my skin feels after using this
pretty good if you were to ask me.
i really like this moisturizer.
i guess especially in summer
he really likes it too
i loved the way this shiseido pureness felt on my skin
i usually am told i look around 40
you don't need a lot of product to really feel hydrated
i feel like this does everything for my skin i need nothing else
i feel like it does plump my skin somewhat
i definitely notice a difference after using this product
my face hasn't looked this good in a while
not a big deal to me
honestly leaves the skin feeling nice
love to try every new thing
i know some people think it is heavy
since my work gives me lots of stress
not really greasy either.
obviously i'm doing something right with using this product
this will make sure skin feel like
i am pretty sure i will be using this jar for a long time
sure is nice to have
so that's always a big concern
i feel like my skin finally feels balanced after many years of possibly using moisturizer that was too lightweight for me
i realized that maybe a good intensive moisturizer was exactly what i had needed
because it's going to be hard to go back
it just looks so amazing during the time i have it on
i see why people keep this for life.
got this for my mom, she loves this cream!
it just feels so good applying it to my skin
it honestly feels like i got a face lift!
i will definitely recommend this to my mom.
see just how amazing this cream really is
ever since using shiseido i've been asked what i've done to make my face look so bright
i'd like to see it here, too.
added bonus: it makes my skin tone look even
this really works for me.
this is what a good moisturizer should be.
this one is always a staple for me
it sinks in really well
she gave me 2 little try me containers
i felt it on my face
it always fixes my skin no matter what i've done to it
it just looks really healthy which makes me happy
this helped tremendously so after my sample ran out
you truly only need just a bit
i really like it.
i guess you can my skin is pretty sensitive.
take such good care of my skin
right now it works wonder for me
already love how my skin feels
it moisturizes really really well
i am always a little nervous trying a new face cream
what out shisedio here i come :)
it has revitalized my skin to where it looks the best it has looked in as long as i can remember
it seemed like my face was pretty shiny by the afternoon
my skin feels great when i wake up.
though it looks really thick
it seems like it would feel really heavy on your face
once it is absorbed it feels really light
it worked wonders on me then im sure the girls will love the results as well :
i actually feel like it's quite rich
esp when your friends tell you how nice your skin looks then ask what product/s you use
for this one i feel like i should
i definitely see some improvement in my skin
i love the way it feels
i feel like i am pretty even-tone
oh yeah i look very different
i feel it makes a big difference
maybe she does not want everyone to look beautiful
i definitely found it
my skin felt softer and looked great.
sheseido produces results with their moistrizers they really do
i really like this cleanser.
i agree with some reviews that said it feels like it sucks all the moisture out of the skin
for those saying it feels tight
in an amazing way as my pores are basically gone
i think it really cleanses well
make my face feel
that's not too strong
t works really good for me
i see the difference of my skin
i think that is the reason that some people experience dryness after using it
it made my face feel so clean
especially if you have makeup on
you really want to make sure it's all off your skin at the end of the day
i normally get a really bad breakout right before my period
i felt like i needed something that had a little muscle
feel like i've finally found the one that works for me
it does clean my face very well
i also like how i need a really small amount to use on my skin
while i love trying new stuff
it helps me keep track of where i've been
it really works on brighten up my skin
you feel so clean
i love the way this feels on my face
the way my skin feels afterwards
lolmy only gripe about this product is that it'll get my face all nice an clean
i definately realized my face has been brightening a lot other than my regular cleansing foam
what i felt after trying this foam my face looks more clean
it makes me feel fresh
i can really see my face getting brighter after using the cleanser
i like how light it is
yet it lathers up really well
this one is definitely one of my favourite
if you're skin is oil, this stuff is good.
definitely goes a long way as it lathers really well
i found it to be a very good value
it really isnt that foamy to me
i know this tube is going to last me a long time because only a tiny dollop on my clarisonic mia goes on my whole face
it makes a really nice foam with just a little bit of product
it makes me think it's working better
i think it works!
i really think my face looks more even after
this cleanser really does leave your skin a lot brighter
your face will feel tight
whenever my skin feels horrible in the mornings this product brings it back to life
it just leaves my skin feeling so good!
i definitely see a brighter
i definitely see a difference in my skin texture
i may not be the best judge of this quality since my skin tone is pretty even through countless serums
it was funny too watch, though).
really goes to work on those darn sun
i lost all hope in finding a product that really does
it really cleans so well
this really is a must-have
'm pretty sure this product will last for many months
need something that really work
it's part of a great line that i've experienced works well toward giving you an even skin tone
love the way it makes my face look
i really love this cleanser!
i can feel the difference right away
my skin responds really well
hopefully the cream works better for me
makes my skin feels so good
my favorite thing about it is that it really luminizes my skin
i just like the way that it feels and smells.
i tried this lotion as i felt like i needed a change
i don't feel a great change after using shiseido
as i don't think a big change is good for your skin
i love how light it is
i really like this product
makes my skin feel
this stuff worked for me instantly
i love how this product goes on smooth
i just hope it evens out my skin tone
it feels like i have nothing on under my makeup
i really like this moisturizer!
this is definitely a keeper
for a few days i was not sure i liked it
just wanted something which would lighten
my skin definitely looks
really works at evening out my skin tone
i really like shiseido products.
the combination has really helped even out my skintone
it feels great on and even out my skin tone.
i love the feel of it when it goes on
i really like this cream.
it gets the job done
i will definitely recommend it
it looks like i had a great night's sleep
he wanted to know what i had been doing differently
this one feels very good the second i put it on
i really loved it
it feels good going on and absorbs well.
my concealer started to crease really bad while wearing makeup no matter what i did
you definitely want to spend the money
plus you always get what you pay for.
i especially like this for when i travel
this has been the one to truly improve the look of my eye lids
it gets the job done
m not sure about the brightening factor --
my whole eye area is smooth
this one is definitely that
didn't really notice a huge difference in my under eye
she loved it too
i feel it does help in that department as well
my eyes can get pretty puffy
this cream has definitely helped reduce them
i now feel comfortable using just a light coverage foundation without feeling like a raccoon when i go out
it feels really smooth on the under eye area
less buffiness, and my eyes do not look as tired.
i really bought this cream for the hydration anyways
i never feel greasy because it absorbs
i really like that this cream has no fragrance or anything that would hurt my eyes
i tried a lot of eye products
i do feel the softness under my eyes
this one definitely hits the spot for me as i wear it all the time
i personally like it
the rich one formula is obviously more nourishing which i really like
i think it offers good value as you don't need a lot
i really recommend this product
it feels great going on my skin either in the morning or at night
i do not have really dark circles under my eyes
this stuff really does the trick
i always look forward to finishing my skin care routine with this
why not give it a try since i was feeling pretty darn desperate
so yeah i'd recommend this product.
however i really enjoyed this eye cream
i am 24 with pretty good skin
always good to start young
i really like this product!
ok i'm not sure what is working because i'm using this plus algenist firming
i can tell you this or this combo has done amazing things
i feel like i have the best looking eyes while i'm using this
i feel like my eye area is really cared for
this one is your guy
the price is pretty nice as well compared to some other br
i can see a big difference
this stuff really really helps with the puffiness it dies take a couple of days yo start seeing results like any produce out of all the eye creams i've tried this one works i use it before i go to bed an in the morning
you honestly need to try this product- i guarantee all it will bring you is healthy looking
honestly, this cleanser is so freaking amazing!
this stuff is the real deal
what can i say it definitely works!
i really like this product because when i first apply it to my face
i decided to buy something expensive since thats what it takes to get good quality
it controls my oil so good.
i really dislike the slippery gel consistency of it so be careful
hopefully they come out with a good toner!!!!!!!
the consistency was really iffy to me at first
after a few times using it i found it to be really nice
this has really helped the breakouts
this product really works for me.
i really like this product because it leaves my face feeling super clean
my face feels really clean afterwards.
i also love that you get a good amount of product here-great bang for your buck
i really like this product
i think the lack of chemicals in this product is really helping my skin
sometimes i forget to use a moisturizer after it because my skin feels great without it
it is controlling the oil so now i feel confident in trying to wear other makeup products over it to see if the oiliness will be held at bay even when i use foundation
i really like it
i feel that this product
it really does leave it feeling balanced like the name says
thought it sounded like it wouldn't cause me to breakout
they make my skin feel like it should
've tried a lot of products
i think the difference really is the use of all natural ingredients
even though this is marketed toward people with combonation skin it works great for my weird skin
this is the first cleanser i've found that works well on my whole face
feels like it really removes dirt/makeup/oil in my tzone
i really like them both.
i think that it worked well
i really like the way it cleanses
i really feel clean
there is definitely a smell to this product that i do not love
it took me a while to get used to the gel consistancy though
my skin is doing "ok"
not sure if ren is too gentle for me
i felt like i could tell a difference
said she really loved it
: it must be doing its job pretty well
i love the way this cleanser felt on my skin.
it makes washing my face fun again
makes my skin feel nice after washin
many of my friends have asked me what i've been using that cleared my face up so nicely
it is great at getting makeup off too.
it's great it leaves my face feeling very clean
would definitely recommend it.
it is light, but gets the job done.
it is also so sensitive that i have had a horrible time finding skin care products that don't make me break out
a sales person at the store said her skin seemed alot like mine acne wise
it has really helped my skin clear up
i really like this product
it did dry my skin out a little--other than that i would call it great stuff
i really needed something
wanted to find something that was going to give me control on breakouts
my face does not feel tight
my skin has never felt or looked better!
my skin feels nice after i use it.
it does not do a very good job of removing eye makeup however
so never feel like my face isn't clean
this has been very ''soft'' on me
i find it smells really good
it turns out i loved it
i am going to be honest
after washing it i always feel it tight
now i can touch it whenever i want this was a great find for me
i really enjoy using this cleanser
besides that it makes my skin feel great
i always look forward to using this product as part of my skin care routine
just the way it feels on my skin as well as the way it feels afterwards
i tried a lot of things that would just dry me out
i seriously love how soft it makes my skin feel
this stuff just helps is break up
i really appreciate that
not tight like some products do
i really like it because it was gentle
so to save myself some money
i can`t believe how quick it worked
not sure about makeup removing qualities as i don`t really use makeup
i will definitely be sticking with this product.
it was just ok
definitely great if you have sensitive skin.
i feel like i'm doing something good for my skin when i use this cleanser
i would definitely recommend!
this product is definitely it
you do need to be generous with the application to feel like you are really cleaning your face
i really love this cleanser.
does not make my face feel tight
now that i know how good this cleanser works
my skin has never felt or looked better!
all that other stuff that is horrible for you too
it is really good at the cheeks
that's how i knew i am so obsessed with this!
it says it all!
i like how is has a lot of ingredients like coconut
i really do like it.
i really like this product
i really love this product.
every other day for my skin to feel really clean
i always come back to this cleanser
let's just say i've never been so happy with a cleanser in my entire life
does not feel like it is stripping my skin of good stuff
it really seems to be the final umph!
liked something about each of them
i swear i feel younger in the morning
while i liked something about each of those
when a sephora beauty specialist got a hold of me she quickly let me know that i am having some sort of allergic reaction
this facewash seems to get the job done!
i get so many compliments about my skin
it feels really nice on my very
this does feel nice on my skin
which was a little weird
she said yes this would be a good cleanser for the acne
i really love this cleanser.
i really like this!
i really encourage you to give this a try.
makes sure that eyes are not puffy after no sleep great product
which is always a good thing
she recommended this product because i told her that i was not liking what was happening around my eyes
i do like how it feels.
i can definitely feel the uplifting effects of it
i would say that it has definitely helped with the dryness
it really works wonders
i really like this eye jel.
feels really good and makes my eyes look younger.
i realize that nothing is going to be 100% satisfying to me
it feels refreshing to put on, too.
when i first started using it i can really see a difference in my under eye circles
what i love about it is that it's very light
i always hang on to that hope
i really love this eye gel
it also really helped with dark circles.
i wear it at night so not sure how well it goes with makeup
i really think its the best product out there for re-hydrating in the middle of the day
started getting really bad dark circles
makes me look younger
it really gets rid of my dark circles
i really like this product.
i really loved the way it opened up my eyes
especially for those like myself that are getting fine lines
i do really like it though and it works!
this gel helped me feel better about my skin
i enjoy it though.
the dermotoligist told us at a skin consultation we went to together that there was no product that really works on undereye puffiness
still wanting to help my mother
makes them water up really bad so just watch out for that
obviously lose quite a bit of sleep during the year
i loved this stuff from day one!
i think i look brighter
my fiance even commented on how great i look.
it feels really good too.
i see a difference with my eyes
i really enjoy using this eye cream
it absorbs really well
but this certainly helps.
i really like this eye gel
i love the feel of this product on my skin.
the only thing i don't really like too much is the smell of the cream
all that bad stuff it is okay
i honestly wake up with my skin looking
i've never really liked using night creams because they often felt so heavy
this one absorbs really well
i really look forward to putting this on at night
felt i had to mix it with quite a bit of oil at night to get enough moisture
so for the winter i treated myself to this little beauty
this consistency just right
i really like it!
i feel a difference in my skin
i really like this product.
i don't feel that with ren's product
only if your sense of smell is crazy strong like mine
i really love this night time moisturizer.
i feel good knowing that there is no parabens
this make me feel relax
seems that the product finishes pretty quickly
my skin always get rash
honestly i think it's pretty mild
i feel like it has helped lighten
my skin feels really smooth
its pretty amazing how little amount of this product you really needed to moisturize your face
this product has done wonders for my skin
obviously i love the easy to use pump!
my skin does look amazing when i wake up
i really enjoy this moisturizer!
always reminds me of the beginning of twilight
so that i can feel it work
i can already feel my skin getting softer
i really enjoy using this product
my skin literally feels like something else in the morning…
i am on my second bottle of this stuff because i love it so much
this does not feel heavy at all
you know your night cream must be working if you wake up to skin so good that you feel like all you need is just a splash of water
you know your night cream works when you actually wake up to skin so good that you feel you can just splash some cold water
i do see it does make my skin look better in the morning
one thing i couldn't get pass was the smell for me it smelled like some type of medicine
my skin always looks
her skin is obviously mor emature
i liked it a lot.
i got used to the weird smell
i feel like it helps my skin feel
everything went very right with this
this stuff is a miracle
is very light on your skin at the same moment
i just like everything about it
doesn't feel like it is just sitting on top of my skin
i would definitely recommend this to any one.
this mask is a little weird at first to get used to when taking it off
im not sure if it helped with my pores
my face does feel good after using it
i like how it feels light
nterested in ren mask products at the moment since i heard lots of good thing about them
my favourite thing about this mask is that to take it off
really does the job
this mask makes you stay pretty between time frame without wanting to reuse
your skin looks pretty after you use it
the guy at the sephora store said that this is a great detox mask if you have stress in your life
it actually looks really gross once it starts to come out
yeah you can see it
i could really see how the mask draws the oil out
it definitely says what it does.
this stuff i loved
my face felt so smooth
i feel amazing after using this product
i put on a lot
i definitely know its working because when i use it consistantly my pores stay clear
so i know this is working.
i really like this mask
t's not too great with oil control
i loved how easy this mask was to use
i love the way my skin feels after i use it it deffinately helps
i really love the product.
like the product a lot
it makes my skin feel
i feel like i have to use a lot to get my desired results
i make sure to follow up with a good moisturizer
you still feel clean in the morning i just love ren i need to get a job for them
i am always worried she will break the bottle in the shower
since then i've tried a whole bunch of other things
this definitely has a bit of a sting to it when you first start using it i attri
i did feel like this product cleared my skin.
my skin hasn't looked this good since i was a 14!
this product did a good job keeping the acne under control
it's very good for helping keep skin clear.
that's actually a good thing because that means it's working long after you're done washing
really wanted a wash that works on its own
really love this wash.
really helped clear out my acne.
it was seriously screwing with my self confidence
this stuff really seems to be doing the trick
this one definitely st
the packaging however is not so great.
it really does help with my adult acne.
you can even feel it working
i started getting hormonal breakouts really bad when i was 23
i really do love this cleanser.
i definitely think this product helps
gets especially bad right before my period
it does really work
this seems to be the only thing that worked me
to me i feel like it means it's actually working
the other ingredients really make it different
everything else works wonderfully
it's hard to find something that really helps clear up my acne
i don't even feel like i have to wear foundation.
my skin is usually pretty clear
made sure to get lots of sleep
is really saying something
acne has never really been a problem for me
i never knew my skin could look this beautiful
i would definitely recommend this to someone who has a sudden breakout of adult acne
spot treatments that have done nothing for me
the combo has really helped my skin
i think i have found the cleanser for me for life
i must say it has cleared up quite a bit of my acne
i do know that my skin feels super clean after using this product
feel like i'm putting the medicine my skin needs into it
i love that i can feel it working on my skin
on the 8th day he created "ain't misbehavin'" for all of us out there who thought we'd have to struggle with acne for the rest of our lives
it just got all chunky
definitely recommend this face wash
really suited my skin well.
you know the tightening feel you get after cleansing your face- not a good thing
it feels so good
really bad acne since about 13-14
it's pretty fast acting
i've always had very clear skin
my only issue with it is that it smells horrible.
i don't feel that it gets off all of my makeup
i didn't know how good my skin could feel
i recently had a really really bad breakout for months over the summer
would avoid seeing friends because i felt
i feel comfortable enough to not wear makeup when doing err
this is works wonders on my skin
i think that is just my skin
i felt it definitely deserved one
omly started looking up good skin care that actually targets
just wish my face felt clean after use.
this stuff works wonders!
i like being able to feel it working
a half i guess i started noticing that my skin actually looked like it had life
i couldn't believe how fast it worked these spots have been here as long as i can remember
my skin did feel greasy afterwards
my skin looked really nice
my acne it's not so bad anymore i'm very happy
my skin was never really "clear".
i can feel it working with each use.
changing birth control really made my face go crazy
my skin hasn't look this good in forever
check out my may favorites video to see what else i’ve been loving
i can feel it fighting it
this is the only thing that has truly stopped pimples in their tracks
s this little guy
if i feel a breakout coming i pat this on right away
i got a few samples of this product as i wanted to see how well it worked
i know it has a lot to do with my hormones changing
honestly when i read other reviews about the smell etc i was thinking "i've had bad skin all of my life
this seems to be the only thing that really keeps it at bay
it seems like this product is really working for my oily
really needed something for my adult skin
it has this refreshing feel to it that i love
this product takes a week to really start to see results
now that i'm in my 30s it's so frustrating to still be getting breakouts
it really keeps my skin clear
for the past 6 or so months i have been breaking out very badly not sure whether it was diet
my right side did break out pretty bad over the past few says
clearing everything just enough for me to look good on my prom night
this product is honestly one of the best things that's eve happened to me
because i never felt that it really worked
this stuff really does work!
have tried sooo many different products
really cleared up my face very fast
it is working really working
you can feel it working2
i feel better about my skin
really felt like i got every last drop.
it just felt good
it's honestly really great.
i know everyone's skin type is very different
i really think it would be a good idea to give this one a chance
i feel like a lot of other people would be too
i ordered this one night when i was feeling really ugly
i can feel it working the moment you apply it on.
there is a lot of product inside
i will always have this in my skin care regimen.
i never really had acne growing up
really took care of my acne
sometimes these things take awhile
this is the only thing that helps me stay clear
i can honestly say that this stuff works amazingly
my acne is really improving
as others have said, this stuff really works!
its even hard for me to believe
i love this product i just hope it keeps working.
then, i got a nice glow, and now i am clear.
because it worked very well for me when other products did not
it really does work
it took about a week to really notice any difference
i always have acne problems
thank you dermadoctor for giving me my beautiful skin back after so long
whatever it is, this stuff is amazing.
it really has worked wonders on my skin
which is not a good thing considering the price
years i've had pretty bad acne
he still loves it
i really wanted something that would make my skin smoother
to see how i liked it and i love it so much.
what it has done for my skin
makes your skin feel really clean
i definitely recommend it
i absolutely love this product i use it 3-4 times a week it is gentle enough to use a lot
my skin does feel a lot smoother
which has always been a really big issue for me
either way i still feel it doing its job regardless of the beads not being as present
that is why i gave it a 5 star review even though i would like a pleasing fragrance
i definitely recommend trying this product!
really very little struggle with acne
this face wash feels so so good
i really like that it's safe to use every day
to really get the job done
you truly get what you pay for.
i love using this every night because it really works hard at getting all the dirt out without being too rough on my skin
my skin always feels so clean
it gives your face a really nice feeling afterwards
really every product from the line
-the smell is pretty bad
the seems to work really well for combo skin
my skins is exactly how i have always wanted it to be:soft
i feel like my other face products go on better
also, my make up looked very polished all day.
you feel the formula working hard into your skin
this is the only one that leaves my skin feeling
it was hard to find something that was gentle
i really feel a difference in my skin after using
which i feel like i need sometimes
also you only need to use a dime size amount for your whole face which is great because it lathers so well
i always had really clear skin
the product was alright.
it feels light and it gets the job done!!
yet i feel it really cleans your pores well
some have mentioned it smells bad
n doing a comparison i think the purity is very nice
this is way better this actually makes me feel like i am getting that full exfoliation
i feel like when this is paired with my clarisonic it's the cleanest my face can get at home
i would definitely recommend
honestly my skin has never looked better!
this stuff changed my life.
itching i always got on my cheeks
my cousin actually asked me what foundation i was using to cover up all of my redness
especially knowing you will get such amazing results
this product really actually changed my skin.
hopefully it does not grow dull at me.
thank you for changing my life.
makes my face look
really does smooth out the skin
've tried a lot of products
i said i wanted it for my whole body
you better believe i'm going to keep it
this works for me
i am taking off a star for the texture of the product that always seems like a gimmick to me
i really has changed my skin.
i could see myself working my way through that bottle way too fast
i bet it would work great for someone under makeup
not sure yet if i want to part with my $90 for this product :/first impression is that it's very oily for my combo skin
it really drinks this up
it was such a bad experience especially because i never even got acne in my teenage years
makes my skin feel amazing
i definitely recommend this product
feel like it is a must-have
the price scares me a bit
made my skin feel a little funny
really gets a chance to work on your skin
healthy looking it has ever been my whole life
this definitely helps keep that under control as well
i think that the main thing this product has done for me is that it makes the other moisturizers
it felt super strange on my fingers
on my skin-- it made everything feel like plastic
i can really feel it "feeding" my skin.
definitely helps with fine lines
after using it my face not only feels great
paula's choice actually recommended me something good for once lol
it's always my go-to when my skin needs some r
i think it's very important that it's in a tube because if it was in a jar
it feels really good on
it's my entire routine that's been keeping my skin in decent shape
i actually do really love this product.
it definitely does it promised
it looks just as good now as it did at 22
my skin has been in pretty good condition
this moisturizer is just the thing when you feel like your skin needs some help
i can go and on how amazing this is!
a great product for prevention i guess
i am now a true believer of using the right products making a huge difference
neck feel so good
it does make my skin *look* beautiful when i wake up now
my skin tone was definitely brighter
think it works perfectly for me- it's not too much
my face is pretty messed up to say the least
i really liked repairwear intensive night cream too
i do not feel the need to reaply moisturizer during the day
i want to like other products because i am always attracted to great smelling product
it feels like going on
it's nice to know it's got antioxidants in it to help me out at well
i feel that in the long run this lotion well benefit my skin
i feel that it is helping my skin to be more clear in terms of skin tone when i wake up
people have actually remarked on how good my skin looks
you got it right!
i really like the way this moisturizer smells
i really love this stuff!
i really love it
i am suffering through it though because i feel like everything does
i don't have a whole lot of choices because of my sensitivity
i knew i need to go get myself one
yes my derm said it was ok
it seems to be making a big difference
i've always had really good experiences with clinique products
i really like this moisturiser
really help my skin stay clear
i find i do not need very much to moisturize my face
this is a great night moisturizer that will do what you want it to
very good for those whose skin is starting to show fine lines
that is definitely my number one worry
that stuff really lasts
i really like this texture
it feels like it really sinks into my skin
i really love to get these ptr sets because they have a perfect sized deluxe jar of that stuff
i hope my sort of quite long review helped somebody
i find this product to be very good
am really starting to love it
i really like this moisturizer.
it works really well
it works for me.
really don't like the packaging
it feels nice going on
i now feel like my eyes look like they did when i was younger
it feels so good to know that
none of them have really done anything
my under eyes dont look so old
i am 55 years old so i definitely need eye cream.
this product is great because it really does help with the skin around my eyes
this is just ok really
i can definitely see a difference
it does have a weird smell to it
who is amazing at what he does recommended i try umbrian clay
it is really important to do your research
this honestly after years of trying every type of moisturizer
my only complaint is i feel like the product runs out quickly
that's how much i loved it.
fresh products always work well for me
i can actually feel it firming
i felt no different
don't know how well it performs underneath foundation
i really love it.
they do work well together
nothing really ever works
it works for me
really like this product!
i know some people have commented on the smell
it does work well for me.
so i needed something to really make my skin pow.
also where a lot of my acne is
it works so great that i've found i really only have to use at night after i cleanse
which is wonderful because then i don't have to worry about a moisturizer breaking down my foundation throughout the day
it is very hard to find a moisturizer that doesn't make me break out
it does kind of have a weird smell
it feels very refreshing when i put it on
this one is pretty darn close.
years of my life trying to find a great moisturizer that can h
i feel like it has been helpful
i do feel like it leaves my skin a little on the dryer side
you definitely need a different moisturizer for days when your skin is really dry
at first i didnt like this moisturizer because i was trying to wear it under my foundation
it makes my skin look very nice
it has worked really well on my oily
this regimen is really helping with this

i like trying different ones all the time
i love how light it feels on my face
i love how it makes my face feel.
i really like this product.
see how my skin likes it
i find myself using more because it seems to dry pretty quickly on my skin
i feel like all skin care products deserve a good 6 weeks of trial
since i started my night routine with this cream everyone tells me that my skin looks great
my mom always used lancôme when i was growing up so the scent is very comforting
i really like the smell
makes it feel so enrched
i always find myself returning to this night cream
one of the perks i was not expecting with this product is that it evened out my skin tone entirely
i really like this cream.
it honestly feels like i am putting silk on my face every night

everyone always comments as to how great my skin looks
so i just smile and say thank you.
this has helped me a lot.
the whole acne fightig trio actually

it felt really good
i always get compliments on my complexion.
i guess everything wants to be a gel.
perfect for that pimple you feel coming up because it takes it away

it made my skin look so horrible
i feel way more comfortable with my skin
i would definitely recommend this product.
it took quite awhile
it's also really helped the overall ph of my skin
this has really helped with those
'm not sure how it'd work on old spots
i would definitely recommend this product
being this stuff was pricey
not really for old scarring
definitely something you should get a sample of if you just need a couple of spots treated
some things have helped
if you're like me then this stuff works like a charm
i know it sounds like a lot
your skin is something you have with you for your entire life so take good care of it
i am so glad i found this stuff!
feel like i don't need to cover up my face so much using tons of foundation
this stuff works amazing, and pretty quickly too.

i think this is what helped majorly as well
i actually get compliments on my skin now
it really has transformed my face.
the price is not so good
really works at getting rid of those dark spots.
then i feel invincible
that's where this stuff comes in!
really know if something works
i wanted to write this because i really think the product works :
getting dirty would usually break me out really bad
i find it really hard to find reviews for darker toned individuals
one good thing is that it makes your skin look really hydrated when you wake up
i really recommend this product
not sure if it would work as well if i were tanned
they not only smell but feel amazing.
make my face feel amazing
this stuff, it works.
mainly whenever i feel a breakout coming on
this works perfectly for him.
so not only are they wonderful for the toning step
he seems to like it
they smell pretty good.
says this helps out a lot
the pads are pretty big as well
always saying how refreshing they are.
easy gift for him too!
i recommend it for any person on the go who needs to feel a clean tingle
speaking for most guys
we’re pretty lazy when it comes to taking care of our skin
they get the job done
i really like this product
it makes my face feel great
also has a refreshing feel.
got these for my husband and they work great!
says these really work
he notices that his face really looks
they never seemed to work until a very nice sephora worker told me about anthony
my husband love it and i do too.
it feels good too
recommended for any guy
i must say this product makes my face feel smooth
these astrigent pads are really nice.
they are definately made for "guys."
it's a hard feeling to describe
these are great if right after you you shave
i loved it so much i brought the pads.
my skin feels so smooth after just one use
i feel that there is less texture on my skin
i loved the way it made my skin look.
maybe i'm just psyching myself out here
when i wake up i am always content with how my skin looks
yes i am a huge product junkie so that is saying a lot
im someone who likes to have really smooth clarified skin
i obviously cant exfoliate everyday so this allows me to do just that
feels good, light, not greasy.
my skin has never felt smoother in my life
i will always use this cream!
i felt as if my skin looked better in just one use
the smell made my eyes water something awful
it was definitely not a matter of getting product in my eyes
i've never had smooth skin quite like this in my life
my skin bounces back -- if that makes any sense
this product just fits my skin
i get compliments about my skin
feel i can attri
have always struggled with acne
i do think it has made some of the spots
'm sure the heat
you need very little to cover your face
wow, does this product really work!
i've never really been of the belief that you need to use a line's serum
as long as you feel it spreading, you're good.
it has really worked well on my skin
i definitely recommend it!
i would still get this for my night routine compared to anything else due to how good it has been working for me with everything else
this stuff smells soooo good and feels great on!
feel like my skin has been renewal
i really like this entire line
i felt like i needed to applications of this product to get enough moisture
i am still quite young
it makes my face feel so smooth
so this cream really isn't for me
without really knowing all the benefits of the cream
i could feel this cream at work
really evens out the tone and texture.
i never really paid close attention to my skin
i got quite a few compliments on my skin
i really like this.
i love how it makes my skin feel
i love the way the cream feels on my skin.
i really love this product.
i can see as well as feel a difference when i use it
i feel like i can blow through it in no time
people have been remarking about how good my skin looks
it's very good product i ever been used it.
my skin looks very even
this comes pretty close
look younger than everyone we know
i really love it
it has worked really well.
definitely sticking with this one!
couldn't be happier i love this stuff
loves the feel of it for night time.
it takes something special for me to feel like my dry skin is being helped
her skin looks amazing i'm deffenetly buying it again for her
i love the way my skin feels after using this moisurizer
my skin has never looked this good
my skin looks like i need no make up
i can definitely tell it’s been hydrated all night long
really love the feeling of my skin in the morning
it pretty much does what it says
i feel revitalized in the morning
really helps me fight it
i like the bar of soap because you really get quite a bit of product for your money
have never really found anything that helps
i personally like this better then the cleansing foam
all those fun things i like
i got off the soap just to try something different
it's a really good feeling finding something that actually works
i tried a whole bunch of products
it worked great for him and okay for me.
i really like the soap
i would definitely recommend it for body acne
would definitely recommend this product for everyone to use
this stuff seriously works
i can feel my face more clean afterwards.
it works really well
you can always count on clinique.
you can feel it dry out your skin right away in a good way
we both love it
i love the way my skin feels
this stuff is the bomb
it's awesome totally worth it it's gonna take me a while to finish it
my skin has never looked this good!
it will give you a good idea of how the clinique br
i really love this
i still love it
i really like this bar.
this being in a bar form was really convenient
i didn't really start to develop acne on my chest
every girl deserves to feel pretty in her own skin
it worked, but not very well.
i've just been very afraid to try products because everyone's skin is different
it really does help
i've always loved clinique and now i know why.
it makes my skin feel great all day
who knew a bar soap could make such a great face soap?
so this is actually a really great product.
this has really worked well for my skin.
it also works really well on my acne
this really helps for me
does a good job at getting rid of bacne
this product works really good it keeps away all acne
shoulders go this does the job wonderfully
i do not use this on my whole body
yes i have bacne and it makes me sad.
it's still working well
really helped my acne
it really does make a difference on my skin.
i think that it is working
my face always feels fresh
it is really frustrating because i have tried so many products that end up doing nothing for me
at work i've had several people mention how great my skin looks
this really helps my complexion
they pair really well together.
it really did help clear his breakouts too
i feel like my acne spots are fading too
it makes your face feel really clean
this product really works
this is such a good product it left my skin feeling so smooth
i really like this cleanser
i felt like my skin wasn't looking to great
it also removes make up pretty well.
thought i was destined to always have bad skin
every good thing said was true for me
now my skin looks
i really recommend this
this product really works!
it really isn't a big deal
i am in love with boscia products plus i am a product junkie i have been wanting to try this cleanser for awhile
in general, i really like this cleanser!
i always find my way right back to it
when people ask why does my skin looks so great
i do enjoy this product a lot.
i feel like it does a great job thoroughly cleaning my skin
it feels really refreshing
boscia keeps my face pretty clear although i still get occasional break out
i really got this on a whim
i felt like spending money
that's how i like my make up
i've always had a problem with acne
found it to be an amazing cleanser so she told me about it
my face feels very clean after i use it
it feels so nice on the skin
only one pump is needed because it foams up a lot which is nice
gets the job done
i liked how mild this cleanser felt.
i really like it!
i feel there's something even better
i really like this cleanser!
one thing i do want to point out is that it leaves it kinda dry after
really see the difference
she was searching for good skin care things
i've had a really difficult time finding a good cleanser
it really helps make my skin feel really clean
i would definitely recommend this!
i really like this cleanser
definitely give this a try if you just have mild acne that needs to be gone for good
'm going to say that it was a very high factor in the changes of my skin
it leaves no residue on my skin while still getting it nice
really helped with my acne
i definitely recommend this product!
my skin has never looked so good.
so finding a great cleanser can be a bit of a challenge
it really helps balance out the oil
we have very different skin types
this really helps with my acne.
it works like wonders
it really seems to keep my skin in check
honestly works very well on my combination skin
it still got four stars because i know it is good for maintaining clear skin
it's done a really good job of minimizing my acne
i feel like this product definitely helps maintain clearer skin for me
give a bit of moisture at the same time i think this is definitely worth a shot
really worked for me
i think it's amazing that i finally found a product that works
there isn't a whole lot of product in there for that price
i finally feel like i have control of the blemishes on my face
honestly this stuff deserves way more recognition more people need to know about this
i finally feel good about my skin
-i really do like this one
my complexion looked so different
it feels good on my skin like its tighter
i really like the product.
i really like this product.
it really mattifies my face
now keep my skin looking pretty good with use on a daily basis
i've learned over time that those things cause a breakout for me
this just makes my skin feels so plump
on spots where i feel like a zit is coming on
it feels really light
it will be nice if it does
the fact that its made with natural ingredients makes me feel all the better about it
i really thought that the pesky time-of-the-month breakout i always get was just a part of my life
i am definitely starting to see an improvement
i really do notice a difference in my skin after i use this
one star off because i'm not a huge fan of the smell
what i didn't like was that it felt tight on my skin
one of their friends always seems to know that is better than what they're using
the friends make a great suggestion that really works
i always had some kind of breakout
my face has cleared up tremendously.
finally, and acne product for someone like me.
my skin is still "trowing up" as we speak
it has definitely helped clear my skin
i love this acne treatment because it helped clear breakouts pretty well
i feel i can face the world with less worry as to who sees my face
this is saying a lot.
i'd always had pretty clear skin
the whole combo really works well to keep my complexion clean
always find them to be of good quality
i always had problem skin.
has kept me pretty clear since using it
it is nice to know it is not so toxic as well.
i stopped using this for a while because my skin seemed to be doing really well
i've tried so many different things to deal with my breakouts
works really well as a spot treatment
definitely will keep using.
this stuff works well
this is the only cleanser that i've found actually makes my face feel cool
i also tend to feel like i'm using a lot of the product each time i wash my face
i would definitely recommend
if i do wear makeup i keep it pretty light
i think this cleanser does its job well
i really love it because i find it really convenient that i can apply it to my dry skin
this cleanser do a very good job
really love this product!
i feel like i'm going through the bottle fast
i hate the way this product feels on my skin while i am washing my face
not sure it removes all foundation
this cleanser definitely does what it claims to do
it has really helped my skin
i do feel clean though
i definitely recommend this!
i know i probably need to go to a dermatologist to really get the redness diagnosed
it really does work
although this cleanser does a pretty good job of minimizing redness right after you use it
you can expect it to do a good job of removing makeup
it really is soothing
but always after i have worn makeup.
i love how it makes my skin feel fresh
really like this cleanser
which really feels nice on days when my skin is just angry
it does a pretty good job
if i do feel a pimple coming on
it just kind of sits there
which might feel greasy to some people
i am a big fan of this cleanser now.
i think it works better when you use the kit together
got so tired of trying other cleansers that made my skin feel tight
i honestly feel this cleanser can be used not only for redness
this stuff feels sooo good on the skin.
it feels sooo good
i feel that this
it works well, i love it.
feel that it's a good value
it has really helped quite a bit
you really do not need a lot.
not quite sure about this product
it did kinda work
i feel like i can actually live my life
this stuff really works
i never feel greasy afterwards
let's hope this clinique product gets the job done for a long time because i like it
i truly have tried a bunch of different skin creams
i will definitely buy something else when i'm done with it
i personally think those with rosacea
even in my good skin day i like to use it
pricey, but it really works.
this product helps me a lot.
obviously love this product
i truly feel like this stuff works.
would definitely recomment this product to someone with rosacea
i’ll definitely keep using this cream!
really feel it is making a difference
finally feel like i am using the right products for my skin
this product has really helped my face.
i feel like it does absorb well
never makes my face feel greasy
i always travel with it.
because of how sensitive my skin is i totally messed it up using different creams thinking i needed to treat the acne
this works for me.
my skin feels like a baby after using this.
i used the whole thing
makes my skin feel really good
can really notice a difference in my skin
it really does make a difference
i definitely recommend this to any one with rosacea
i feel like it runs out pretty quickly
this really works on roseca
it has a cooling effect that feels sooo good when i put it on while my skin is in a "flare up"
i feel like if you put it on after you wash your face
it feels so nice
have definitely seen a difference
this cream makes my skin really smoth
it makes my skin feel nice
it does feel nice after you put it on.
just like the product says
i find i can tell a difference if i use the whole redness solution line
my face is really red
well i'm glad she didn't because this stuff works like a charm
so getting to try it beforeh
i feel as though i'm already seeing results
feels good going on
it seems to be just as good
i really put the research into it
i'd definitely recommend this product!
shiseido has always helped my skin.
feels good going on
this product works like a charm for me since i had a hard time finding the right product for my skin
my mom really loves shiseido
my skin really try skin in winter.
i really like this cream.

i could feel how smooth my face was
ok this stuff is weird
when he came home the morning after i used it he commented wow your skin looks amazing
i don't mind because it makes me feel like its working
definitely keeps my skin looking nice
i finally feel like i can go out of the house without face makeup bc my skin already looks so good
hopefully it keeps working.
it seriously helped soooo much
other parts of my face i don't really see a difference
who doesn't like to feel like a product is doing its job?
nothing really seems to work too well
it's really close to being a five star product
it's really nice totally brightens your face
my skin feels so good for days
whenever my skin starts to feel rough
i really like this product!
oh wow my skin has never looked this way before
it works for me
i liked the consistency of it
it cleaned my face really well.
it's actually kind of mindblowing how my texture is always gone when i wash it off
she said i have a lot of texture so she told me to put this mask on there
now i knew i loved this mask
i feel like i'm "resetting" my skin when i use this
this product definitely lives up to it's claims.
i feel that my skin looks amazing each timei use this
you will definitely see results
because you can clearly see a difference on your skin instantly
while it definitely does make my skin feel smoother
this product really worked for me!
people tell me my skin looks great or that i'm glowing---r

my skin actually likes them
i really like this mask
i tried this and really liked it!
this stuff was so gentle
i definitely recommend trying a sample if you can
my face feels so smooth after using this
i feel that the product goes a long way
i feel like it does everything a mask should do
ok guys, this stuff is amazing.
it makes your skin feel so nice after using.
as i believe it could really help you if your skin is at all like mine
it feels amazing on my skin when i apply it
my skin has not looked very good
i wanted to praise this product because it has worked so well for me
i know the benefits go exfoliation are really important
this product does a really good job of it
it definitely does what it claims to do
i feel like there are better masks out there
i felt like there was still a lot of stuff on my face
not really a big deal
i feel this has really evened out my face
in the am only if i'm going to be pretty bare-faced
i never really notice it on my face
this really does help
since it has helped keep my skin looking really clear
the other thing about this that's fantastic is that you can add it to the lotion you use on your face or body
i will put up with it because it's that good
people have said my skin looks nice
i can feel it working
it seemed like i used quite a bit more of my moisturizer then mixing them together
i am hooked and will keep this product always!
your skin looks brighter" at that moment i knew it was working
this has definately lightened it just after 1 month of use
nothing really worked for me 100%
i think the product is doing everything in the description
skin feels great-wonder why i waited so long to try
it's very versatileits very hard to find products that get rid of spots on dark skin
this stuff is a miracle
i definitely see a difference
who see me everyday

i really stuck with this

he's said wow you look so youthful around your eyes today
told me that my eyes look better
i liked it so much i got the eye cream
basically getting no sleep
i really, really love this cream.
i can say that this cream has made the area look very smooth
this is the only thing that's actually ever worked
this eye cream works really well.
have really bad green
it really is so brightening.
now i don't feel self conscious about my dark circles when im not wearing make up
i feel like i've always had dark circles.
they know their stuff
i wanted to make sure this wasn't going to make my eyes water like some under eye creams do
literally on the first week of using this product i saw improvement specially because i have bad dark circles i've always have since i was younger
really helps my dark circles
this stuff really works.
ok so like most of us on here i am a product freak
here is what works for me
see what you think.
guess it's obviously doing something
that's alright because i have another eye cream which takes care of that for me
nothing i've tried has done anything for the dark circles under my eyes
i gave this stuff a shot after trying a different shiseido product i really liked
i just know it works, and it works quick.
i really miss it
dark enough that i feel like i want a lightening product
i always have dark circles
this is definitely the product you want
after about 5-6 weeks i really started to see a difference
i like the smell as well.
this product really does what it says
:) oh and it smells pretty good
it has really helped my dark circles especially during the holidays
i love the way your skin feels after
i don't look like i'm always tired
i've always had dark circles
thought i'd give it a whirl
wanted to find a cream that was good under makeup for the day
i liked the feel of this eye cream
it's probably best for young people to keep the dark circles light
really works on my dark circles.
this eye cream really helps with my dark circles
it definitely helps brighten my eyes
only gave it 4 stars because it's a bit expensive for what you are getting -- a great eye cream for sure
the best way i can describe how my skin feels after 20 minutes
that's how my face feels.
i think you will appreciate this product
love the way this feels on my skin.
i love how my skin feels after applying.
this one is really good light weight moisturizer it's helped my skin improve a lot
really need to be careful as to what i put on my face
absorbs well so makes skin feel like there's nothing on it
it's so refreshing on the skin i feel soooo good when i put it all over my face
i never thought i needed a moisturizer
feel such a huge difference in my skin i can put it under my makeup
thought it was good
i love feeling my face after this stuff sets in.
i really like this moisturizer.
it makes my face feel amazing all day
this stuff actually worked for the first time ever

everyone needs this if your skin feels dull
personally this is a great daytime summer moisturizer for me
sometimes i feel like i need a stronger one when my skin is really dry
i still love it
my skin just feels right when using it.
(she love it too).
i never knew my skin could feel this baby soft
i will find myself touching my face because this goes on wonderful under all the makeup
i wish she hadn't because now i have a harder time ordering it because we all know once jaclyn likes something good fkn luck finding it
she only mentioned great things about

it definitely gives me the moisture i need
it is hard to please me
this always rescues my skin
it has done wonders for my skin
love how this feels on my skin.
i went through it so quickly because i loved how soft my skin felt
i've always had a hard time falling in love with a different moisturizer because it never felt like it truly sunk into my skin or actually helped the dry issue until i found this little piece of heaven
makes my skin feel softer than anything i've ever felt
since zero part of my face is oily i was a bit nervous to try
i still keep going back to this one because it's so fast absorbing
i really like this product!
it feels so good
it absorbs really quickly so you can use it day
i always get nervous with trying new products because my skin is prone to breakouts
i actually enjoy putting it on because i start my morning feeling refreshed

it is definitely lightweight like it says it is.

i am always hesitant on trying new things because my skin is pretty acne prone
is it just me??
my skin don't really do well together
my face feels so nice
because my skin is looking
it not only feels good when applying
fell in love definitely something to invest in

your face is something you look at
i feel like i've discovered a miracle

i really like this
i am one of those people who thinks the face cream without any scent is a little weird
my skin feels so smooth even when i get up!!
i feel like i could burn through this
and i actually love the smell of it.
t's very hard for me to find a good moisturizer to wear on the daytime underneath my foundation
so you can imagine my surprise when i ended up liking this product

it would have been pretty miserable
i personally prefer moisturizer with scent so this one is perfect for me

i am so in love with this product.
i tried this because my moisterizer needed a little pick me up
i used this for a month before i saw a really big difference
for now my skin likes it
my skin looks like i’m in my 20’s and i’m 30.
they think i am 35

there are definitely other cleansers out there at a better price that can do the same thing
don't like how they feel
a couple people commented on how great my skin looked this week
i really like it
i got the last bottle on the shelf- thank goodness because nothing else works on my face now
the other good thing is that you dont have to use a lot of it
this definitely takes that into consideration
its still pretty new to me
i love it and really have my acne problem.
not feel like i've stripped my skin
let me begin by mentioning how incredibly smooth this makes your face
my face always feels amazing

i really like it
it stays in place really good
i just love to put this on my eyes.
this one really works for me.
i feel like i look 5 years younger!
seemed to lose the good effects of this one
i really liked it
however you have to be very careful when you apply this stuff because if you get it in your eyes
it gets the work done
need all the extra help i can get so that i don’t look so tired
i think it was working
i suppose it was great for fine lines, etc.
i like the way it makes my eyes look.
actually felt the product working
i am now a huge believer in this product
sure the are still there
you can actually feel it in your eyes long hours after you have applied it

which seems to be okay
both really do work
when used together, i noticed big difference.

but it really cleans!
i never feel like i'm getting really clean with cream-type cleansers
my skin does feel nice
the smell is not that great, but it is ok.
this doesn't really feel like it works when using it
i really enjoy it.
i definitely recommend this product
this is my 4-5 bottle of this stuff!
love the product but not a big fan of the smell.
this face wash really makes you feel fresh
was not getting the job done
don't feel too tight
my skin really does look more clear
seeing how it works for yourself
i am here to tell you
this product really helps to balance my skin
i really am loving it so far.
i dont mind the smell that others have commented on
it really removes everything on my face
it's nice to know all my makeup is off between the two products
it really cleans your face
really hope that goes away after awhile
i really enjoy using this product.
although didn't smell very good felt like it was cleaning my skin
the products last quite awhile

that something is happening
i really like this product.

i really do feel as though my skin is firmer
have found myself loving most of them
which i think this moisturizer has a lot to do with
you instantly feel it working
you can actually feel it working.
i like the smooth feel
i am always asking my husb
my mother to feel my face
also always touching it myself
thought i'd try it to see what was so great
it really does peel off the years
the skin care specialist told me that i should only use a tiny bit
i figured it had to be great
really struggling with my complexion
for the first time i'm comfortable going out without makeup of any kind
am really seeing good results
i always see something on the cotton pad.
i noticed that sometimes my skin looked extra good
you will definitely see a difference in how your face serums
this stuff feels so good on my skin
i can see a big difference
i definitely recommend giving it a try
i feel comfortable going out in public now with no makeup on
amazing things to say about this br
i've heard a lot of good things about this br
really helps get all the oil
i cannot describe how great it makes my skin feel
love the smell and everything about it!
you really need only about 1/4 pump
i wanted to challenge my skin
even takes off my usually really hard to take off make up
my acne has gone down tremendously
that said, i still love it.
we both get a little acne here
i feel like it doesn't last very long.
gentle on my skin i love that the only problem is the smell i got it because i loved how it smelled

so far this stuff has been great for my dry skin.
how it leaves my face feeling
i definitely recommend giving it a try.
i also really like the container
my husband even said something about it!
i wanted to love this cause it smells so good
i felt that they can be too hash for my skin
i barely have to use any and my skin feels great.
i also get that "tight" feeling
very light and does everything it promises.
ren is the first moisturizer that really feels like it is making a difference
i feel better about my skin
because of the great quality want to try other ren products too
'm always on the lookout for something that will not make my skin feel like it's not having moisture sucked out of it
i love how this feels on my face
i feel good about putting this on everyday :)
it is really light on my skin
my skin is pretty normal
i really love the way it feels on my skin however
i would definitely keep this
definitely not off- putting in any way

have liked them all
so basically, this stuff is amazing!!
this stuff is genius!
this product really works to balance the shine i get in the t-zone area

so far it's working pretty good on my skin.
i really like this as a moisturizer

an hour later you are looking fresh out thedisco shiny or it sried you out so bad you feel super tight
it helps to keep me mattified all day!
it also feels so nice
anyone who struggles with oil control or breakout issues this is a really good one to try
continued to use them simply because i like the feel
it feels really refreshing when it's on
i find it really does leave my skin glowing.
it just feels so nice
making the mask all the more fun to use
my skin feels nice of course right away
to be honest, my skin is pretty good at baseline.
i am not a big fan of skin products
my skin looked so tired
come on, just treat yourself.
this makes me look like i have young
it was definitely cooling
without prompting he actually said my skin looked beautiful
when it got here
it truly feels as though it gets down deep into my pores to really get the dirt
it makes my skin feel
it felt nice on my skin
left my skin feeling so good
have only great things to say
it has done wonders for me
you can literally feel the difference on your face--my skin drinks this stuff up
i liked the feel of it
i feel like this really comes close to comparison
i don't use this on my whole face
i do put it around my whole eye area
so so so pretty.
i really like this product.
was wondering why my skin felt so soft
it is definitely a night cream
i think this would be a good choice for someone who lives in a dry climate
i really love the results.
my skin feels really good after applying it
i really like the way they feel
feel that these products are helping me to not look my age
it's perfect for when i haven't been especially kind to my skin
it appears very tired
my make up looks flawsless i received many compliments on how my skin looks
so much so that friends remarked on it.
i can see a difference in my skin
the only negative about this cream is that i keep wanting to touch my face to feel how soft it is
this stuff truly works
i said it is my miracle in a jar because it is like a dream come true for me
i know that everyone's skin is different
make me look like a greaseball in the morning
'm doing what i can
'm gonna have faith that it firms too
i always take samples with me
love the way my skin looks
this is one of the few products that really works well on my skin
the first week i started using this cream two people told me "you look great
i am in love with how it has made my face look
i even look forward to the smell
she loves it and uses it everyday.
at 25 i want to treat my skin right
my face feels amazing after i put this on!
just really wish it wasn'tso expensive.
if that makes sense
love how my skin looks
my skin has never looked or felt as good without it
serums just makes my skin feel so good
i can honestly say it's made a huge difference in the texture of my skin
my skins still in pretty good condition at this point
feel a difference in my skin after one application
i must say that i do wake each morning with very smooth skin
this one is really quite good
my major complaint is the smell--it is so horribly off-putting to me
i really enjoy this product.
it feels good when i put it on
this one is so nice i often just tissue a bit off
i am constantly trying to find products that leave my skin flawless
my skin looks nothing
my skin has never looked so good
it is very cooling when you put it on
just feels so refreshing
afterwards my skin felt amazing.
it gave a really nice lifting sensation as i had the mask on my face
so your skin feels unirritated all day

it feels so refreshing on your face.
it felt so nice

it actually makes it feel healthier

it feels really nice
this mask gives you what you need
it feels refreshing going on
i love everything about it.
the way it makes my face feel
that's obviously a personal preference
amazing if you feel like your skin is looking/feeling dull
my skin is definitely smoother
loved the cooling feel it had on my face
my skin feels like
which helps me a lot
i would definitely buy it if the price was decent
make your face feel uncomfortable
the smell kinda bothered me
people who i see everyday
commented on how pretty i looked
i did just like how it made my skin feel smooth
a hint of bananas so when i applied it i was surprised that it actually felt cool
i really enjoy this mask!
i really like this stuff.
it also smells like something from my childhood that i cannot quite put my finger on
it would work better for occasions when you really want your skin to look good
i love using it before a big event too.
it made my skin feel great
i wanted to use it everyday
shout out to sephora for always coming in clutch with the promos
has a little bit of a nice tingle to it
too scared i'd fall in love!
my skin feels so great afterwards
definitely makes you feel like you're giving yourself a nice spa treatment
i liked this, i really did!
i think the smell is what made me fall in love.
because i thought my skin was burning until i read that the mask is supposed to feel cooling
'm going to provide both her
when i first tried this i thought the texture was weird
i also find that it works great if you are feeling exhausted
my mom steals it from me too.
i couldn't believe how soft it made my face feel afterwards
i've noticed better looking skin for sure.
first off let me say i'm a college student with lots of stress
what is in this stuff?
it's a pretty huge container for how little you use in a go
it's been great so far in making my skin feel smooth
there are other masks out there that do just as good a job
i always get compliments on how clear my face is
also makes my skin feel tighter
this you can feel by h
i really like this mask
pretty sure it cleared my acne too #flawless
it really feels amazing on the skin.
i truly love this cleanser so much.

i've always struggled with acne
i always come back to this cleanser
this stuff really does what is says it will

why i choose this product because it really cleans surface of my face quickly
i think for winter
i can actually feel it
oily skin: this is the only thing that i have ever found that leaves my face feeling really clean

it is just very good
this really does what it says.
this stuff is magic-
my skin feels so good after using it
this seems to work for me.
it feels so good
trust me you need a very little amount of the product

i really like this product.
it leaves my face feeling so nice
i wear quite a bit
this is seriously a really good cleanser.
definitely my go to cleanser.
i always use this after a long day of wearing my makeup from work
my only complaint is that my boyfriend steals it because he loves it too
he loves using it
it does a pretty good job at removing it all
one thing i have to do this one justice is that a little truly goes a long way
have always struggled to find the perfect cleanser until now
all you need is a little which cleans a whole lot
i really loved how it left my face feeling.
keeps my skin from going crazy
i really like this stuff.
this does a great job of getting my skin squeeky clean
i really love it
i find that it cleans my face really well
it seems to even me out perfectly
it's also really good at taking makeup off.
i do think it leaves my skin brighter
t shocked me to find a product that's not only wonderfully gentle on my skin
it is seriously just that good
just love this product.
it does a great job doing it without drying my skin
i like this a lot
i can believe how clean my face got with so little product
it gives me what i want!
really like this cleanser.
this stuff really gets your face clean.
i really like this cleanser.
(literally, you can feel lit).
that's the whole point of a cleanser right?
i definitely love this cleanser
this is a cleanser i will always use with my clarisonic
although i really do enjoy it
it does a good job at removing makeup
we have very different skin types
it has this really light smell that just wakes you up
makes you feel really fresh
i love the way this product feels on my skin
i love the way my skin feels after using the product
it actually feels like water on the face
i don't really see a big difference between this one
it was a pleasant mistake since i tried it anyways
though there has been times where im very tired
he loves them too
feels like it keeps my ph in balance
i felt like i really enjoyed this
this stuff is awesome if you are lazy like me
i never liked wearing makeup
because it was always such a pain in the
it smells really pretty too
it would take quite a lot for it to completely make my face clear of all make-up
for the most part it is a great product because it makes your skin feel clean
it gets your face pretty clean
you can actually feel your skin breathe after you use it
i really love it
it works for me.
i really love this product.
the oil is very versatile so you get a lot of worth for what you're spending
it makes it look like i take good care of my skin lol this is the product of my dreams
it truly has worked wonders on my skin
this stuff works so well
i tell everyone about this stuff
definitely you need it regardless
pretty much everything in between to help with my acne
i really do think it hydrates my face
quickly learned that it was great on my skin
my first impression on it was that it really did not affect my sensitive skin
this stuff must come from the heavens because it is honestly the best stuff i've ever used before
have not found one that really improved my skin
the first thing about this face oil is that i love is that it is pure
definitely try it out
my skin has never looked or felt better
getting to know what works for my skin
my skin has never looked or felt better
this oil however makes my skin look so pretty!
this oil makes my skin feel so hydrated for pretty much the whole day until it's time for me to wash again
lasts me whole day
turn things around for me
i am sure it will work there as well :
he was so excited to see the change of my face so he started using it too
everyone tells me how 'perfect' my skin is
my face was pretty much mate
where to begin... i love this stuff.
was worried that it wouldn't be well-suited for my skin type
how weird is that!?
i mix it into everything
- just something that doesn't make me feel the greatest
this product really made a difference
even if the packaging is nice
i am definitely hooked
i really do like it.
it really makes a difference
it makes my foundation look so good
hopefully it works for them as amazing as it's worked for me
just like my skin
neither are as good in my opinion
i really wanted to find something that would deeply moisturize my dry areas
it has no fragrance which i really like
not look like i changed my car's oil with my face
it felt so nice
it really makes a difference
i love this product because it works well on my skin
i like this product because you can actually feel it working
its also really nice to use as a base before foundation
this stuff really is as good as people say.
this stuff is too good to keep to myself
honestly this makes my skin feel like a baby skin after continual use
feel like a lot of it has 2 do with how this oil makes my face so moisturized
doesnt really help my skin
wow i cannot stress how good this stuff is.
if you feel weird about putting oil on your skin
look like i feel i should
i actually liked it
which was nice for mornings or before makeup
it didn't have a strong smell which is always a plus
i will totally buy the big bottle when i'm out
this feels amazing when you put it on
i like it a lot.
this one is really amazing i do like it!
it really made a difference
although i never write reviews this serum make me feel that i have to share it with the world in one week of used my skin looks so much radiant
makes my skin feel nice
i've always had problem skin
what a difference it makes.
it feels good going on
then my primer really helps my make up stay on
i love the feel of it
think that depends with what you clean your face how the other products are gonna work
i think there are other great things about this product
this stuff was a miracle.
i love how it goes on so light/smooth
it is a great partner with whatever night moisturizer you may use
this stuff was a life saver.
ps: feels kinda like i got a little filler added to my face all the way around so happy i found this line
it really helps my night cream to work better since it captures
that is definitely not the case
applying it only makes you look good for the day
she was very right.
feel as if it is doing the job to lock moisture into my skin
i feel it's working
you can just feel than after you put it on your face
you can feel your skin really tightening up
i am seeing nice smooth skin when i wake up
it absorbs really fast and does not feel greasy.
another benefit is it seems to plump up your skin so you look younger
i love it because it feels like my skin is getting a drink of water
i love how my skin looks
it definitely seems to help.
have always heard how good hyaluronic acid is for your skin
i feel already my skin softer
i think it is helping my moisturizer perform better
that is enough for my whole face
i love how my skin looks
i've tried a lot of different things
really like the texture
how my skin feels after using it
gives me just the right amount of moisture
i always find myself coming back to this moisturizer
i still get a great color without ever burning
my personal beauty adviser suggested it to me when i was complaining about the dull complexion of my skin so he told me about how i should try this moisturizer
i gave it 4 stars because not everybody has my super sensitive
and it definitely does not feel like sunscreen!
having combination skin makes it hard to find the right moisturizer
it feels amaing on your face
i really like this moisturizer.
this probably isn't a good choice as your foundation will probably slide right off
my other review will tell you more on what i think of this awesome product
it helps me look fresh when i'm stressed out of my mind
so this is a dream come true
i really like this moisturizer
i love how light it is
a lot of products make me break out
i really prefer a squeeze tube.
this product really protects my face
it's pretty darn good stuff
don't like how they make my face feel
i am pretty picky with my day face cream
which is really what my skin needs as i don't have wrinkles
would definitely recommend to anybody
it makes my skin feel amazing
makes me feel a little too greasy
the only thing i really don't like is the smell
i really like this product
this is the first one that i hve used that actually didnt make my skin feel real oily through out the day
this stuff makes your skin feel so dewey
it never feels greasy
overall i really love this moisturizer
my only concern is that it leaves me wondering just how long the spf really works
i am not sure if it really makes your skin look younger
because that's hard to see on yourself
love how it works on my skin
clinique is really all about skin care
it really holds up well on my skin
i feel good about the spf 20
i really do love it as a whole
it's definitely a must-have in our home
i get compliments on my skin a lot
always find myself coming back to this one
i really think it has helped keep my skin young
there are definitely other moisturizers that work better for me
still, i think it's a good product.
it feels nice when put on
this is definitely a keeper!
i really despise putting this on just because of the smell
how it felt so good against my skin
this is the one thing i can not sacrifice in my lean living
this makes your skin feel amazing
i really don't want it to come back
not only is this a great feeling product on my skin
i really like the superdefense.
i still love it
this did the job and without feeling greasy.
which is great if you feel really dry
i love everything about it!
this really protects my skin
leaves just enough moisture to feel like you've actually done something good for your skin
not good enough for a day at the beach
this stuff works very well.
it really goes on smooth
makes me feel better about the sunlight i know i get
this moisturizer is amazing it never broke me our or gave me little bumps
it's always different tone everyday.
i love it, beause you can feel you skin so soft
it feels like it's really sinking in
my skin definitely feels healthier
i really love it
so really when you think of it that way what do you have to lose
yes even at my "young" age
it's amazing, and i will definitely buy it again.
this for the most part has really helped to sort that out
this product has definitely helped with all of my issues
i can definitely say that i look forward to the smell now
definitely not overwhelming like others stated
my skin does not feel tight
just wasn't doing a great job
makes it hard to travel with it
you make me feel good
i love how it feels after
i definitely recommend it to everyone.
which means its obviously going to smell green
it is $40, but it lasts really loooooooong time.
i'll definitely keep using this!
said it was high quality stuff as she used it also
wow was she right.
i feel like my skin is soooo clean after
i really like it
still get the job done
i always find myself going back
in order to really experience
you really need to use all products from this line
some work pretty well, some not at all.
this is a good product to use it hasnt irritated my skin at all
make your skin feel amazing
the best thing i have done for my skin is to stop doing this
it really gets the makeup
i love the way this cream makes it feel
because he didn't have a moisturizer he really liked
i happen to like the texture
little did i know what i was getting myself into
can feel how amazing it is on my skin
like everyone else said
my skin hasn't looked or felt this good in a long time
i love the way my skin feels now
really what i need was a good moisturizer
love the way it looks with my foundation
i am really glad that i discover such a great br
i make sure i never run out because my skin is addicted to it
even my boyfriend was amazed at how baby smooth my skin feels
i always get compliments on my skin when i use this
the smell is a little weird at first
i really love this !
finding a cream is really difficult for me because i break out easily
this is the first product i've found that hydrates really well
i really like the smell
i think this product would be great if you had extra dry skin
my skin hasn't looked this good in a couple of years
like what others have said
i think it definitely has the right amount of moisture
think it helps even me
i always look really hard at the ingredients of the products i used
it is really hard to find a good eye cream without breaking the bank
i can genuinely say that my eye area feels very hydrated
i would say this cream is good for a younger person looking to maintain good skin
luckily i have no sensitivity issues with jurlique
this is soothing and never bothers my eyes.
has done wonders for my eye area
this really fits the bill
this winter i have been waking up to what i call "thirsty" eyes-- basically a horrible look
i really like the texture.
i definitely recommend this to everyone
it felt really good when i put the cream around my eyes
it is strange how things are
i also think it is an awesome value for its money since you only need a tad amount
i really like this eyecrea
so, this could just be my personal taste.
i always looked tired
there are two small problems- one is that it smells bad to me
you actually feel your skin tightening up around the eye
i think my eye 'issues' go beyond this cream
you could almost feel it working
i can already see a big difference in the look
biodynamic i really feel like i am doing something great for my skin
what others say about the consistency is true- it feels thick
this works for me
i feellike this has really helped clear my skin.
& it keeps me matte for my whole work day!
i feel like my skin is normal
it gets the job done
fall where i am not quite my oiliest
this will definitely always be a part of my daily routine
its great that its not horribly girly looking so hes not ashamed to carry it around
he said it worked fairly well for him
this works really well.
it helps everything stay put
my face is so shiny you could probably see your reflection in it
really controls oil on my face
that's how i was after finalllyyyyyyy finding something to mattify me
my makeup stays exactly how it looked in the morning
my face always got shiny in my tzone no matter what until i got this
so that says something
so over all i love this product
initially thought the consistency was too weird
said i should start with basics like moisturizer
i really like when my moisturizer has spf because i am a student
my one complaint is that it sometimes feels a bit burny
it really does mattify your skin!
i love how it makes my face feel
tried pretty much everything
- it really does make your face look that smooth
we both have really oily skin
this really helped my foundation stay fresh.
she scared me when she told me the spf would make me break out
a couple of things i'd like to point out:1.
you really need to work this into your skin.
8 hour shift i don't feel like i need to was my face
it makes my face feels so smooth
making it hard to find a good moisturizer
would definitely recommend this product
and it really helps me not breakout.
this stuff has helped tremendously
i start to look oily i never feel like i have a ton of oil on my face
for now it does a great job keeping the greasy feeling at bay
so foamy and works really well with my clarisonic
this stuff is actually really good.
oh my gosh i have never ever had a product as great as this
helps me not to touch it
does a good job at making me look less like a grease ball
this one really does control the oil.
it really does work
definitely keeps my make up on all day
i really like how it instantly mattifies
i feel like it has made my face a lot softer
a lot of times mattifying i know right away it is not for me
it still was just as amazing
have received many compliments on how good my skin looks
it is definitely true for me
it definitely was mattifying my skin better
it does a great job keeping me from getting shiny during the day as well which is a huge plus if i'm not wearing make up or bb cream
my face feel really clean after i used it
this stuff has seriously changed my life
likes the way it makes his skin feel
it honestly amazes me.
this stuff will clean your face so hard it might actually sting afterwards
how great that is depends kind of on what "clean" feels like to you
gets your face really clean
it always worked well for me
when it comes to face wash there are a few important qualities i look for
i found myself really liking that feeling so that it absorbed all of my skin products well after
makes your face feel really clean
but i still love it!
knowing that going from wearing nothing
i really like this it cleans my skin
it foams up really well so you don't have to use very much at all
i feel like this is going to last me a long time
great at getting rid of makeup as well
i love the way it makes my skin feel.
i love this one since i have concern about cleaner which can really do the work
i honestly would prefer this with a nice rose scent or none at all
it certainly makes your face feel wonderful after a wash
it feels so fresh after you are done
i really like this cleanser.
it foams up quite a lot
i do really like this cleanser
i don't feel like it's very mild.
after i use it i can feel zero oil on my face
clarins is definitely the exception
now he loves it too
makes my skin feel nice
this clarins product got really good reviews
it foams really well
thought it was just my genes or stress
i feel that my skin is more glowy in the morning as well
guys might love this for shaving.
it was really good
he also loves it
my skin has never felt so clean.
i do a lot of treatments on my face
how fresh it makes my face feel every time i wash
i'd love to try that one as well.
know it is working
i truly believe this helps keep my acne under control
that's really what it is
it makes my face feel very clean
feel like it gets all the days oil
it keeps the ph balance on my face feeling nice
got all my makeup off, and my face felt great.
i love the smell, the feel, and the results.
i love the way it makes my skin feel
they work so well together
it really does make lines
i never get compliments on my skin
this gives me nice hydration without being too heavy
love this - wear it every day.
i can definitely see a reduction in my fine lines
luckily i think it smells fresh
my skin feels better the moment i apply it!
loved the way it feels on the skin
the fact that it contains spf makes it pretty much perfect in my mind
'm always on the hunt for a better moisturizer that combats both of those issues
feels good going on
it absorbs pretty quickly to make up for that i think
i really love this product!
my professional face still looked good at the end of the day
does not leave my skin feeling tight
i think it keeps my skin nice
however, it did make my skin look great.
skin feels really good
everything makes me break out
im not sure about firmer.
it really does make lines
i never get compliments on my skin
it took me awhile to find the right product
it does very good work to your skin surrounding your eyes
it feels nice to have such a smooth cream on my tired skin
it's good enough for me to see the difference :
it really works for my skin
i could already feel the product working!
my makeup look's so good
decided it was time to get a good eye cream
it feels very nice on the skin
it really seems to have calmed things down
guys, don't think this product is just for women.
very nice product have only been using it for 2 weeks it does noticibly reduce puffiness
the way it makes my skin feel
i'd definitely recommend it to everyone.
i love how this product keeps my skin looking young
already have very good skin
this product really works!
there is definitely one
this stuff is so amazing i want to share it with everyone
love the way my skin looks
i really liked this product
really liked the product
people always say how good i look
you can feel it working
doesn’t feel greasy because it soaks in so completely that i can’t tell that i’ve even put it on
it certainly is working on de-puffing
really does lift the eyes
i really want this to work...it is pricey.
i can really see a difference!
i pretty much buy everything perricone comes out with
i can feel them now
i do feel like it did a really nice job on my dark circles
love the feel of this.
so many things are happening.
right now my skin definitely feels better than it looks
i feel it will last me quite a while
dark spots that make me so self conscious i feel i need to wear foundation at all times
my face deserves it
this really does seem to improve the texture of my skin
i really like this product
this really helped controlled my acne without hurting my skin
i would definitely recommend this product
though when i have it still seems to work as good anyways
was really tired of all the flaking
i would really encourage
as i age my once tough skin needs babying.
this is definitely that
i like the way my skin looks
not only does my skin look amazing
i never really had bad skin
since i have been using this i actually get compliments on how nice it looks
its nice to hear at 34
i will definitely keep buying!
first few times using the product i peeled pretty good
just know that it is very powerful stuff!
i hated the way they felt
this one feels like it is working
i can definitely see
feel a difference in my skin
really think it works as advertised
like the way my skin feels
would definitely recommend it
it is the only thing that makes a difference in my skin
not really useful to my eyes
i't's really important not to mix it with anything cause that can mess up how it works
this stuff makes my face very smooth
good things to say about poetry in lotion
people keep asking me what i'm doing with my skin
i honestly haven't been able to find any retinol product quite like this
i feel pretty comfortable after a week going out with only a little mascara on
i prefer the feel to dermadoctor's version
what i really noticed though was the smooth texture
i really love this product
i really like this product.
it does just what is says it does -- makes my skin look healthy
you will always look younger than your real age
the very first day i could see a big difference
this product is really irritating my face
it definitely does what is says it will
i am trying hard to follow the directions
this product works really well before applying my makeup
no weird film is left over
this feels so good
'm not sure how well this works on mature skin
i really like this moisturizer.
it works really well under make up
i feel like i look younger using this product.
it feels so light on my skin
helps it feel so smooth
it feels so nice on the skin
love this product- definitely going to repurchase
tough to find a product like this which can do it all
nothing feels as light
packaging is so pretty.
seriously have struggled forever to find a moisturizer that actually works without making me breakout/greasy
this moisturizer really really really helped
feel good after using it
asked me what makeup am i using because my face looked flawless
you definitely get results with this
my skin really must've needed this--it just drinks it up
it does feel like it's very basic
this is the stuff
my skin always looks better in the am
i feel this moisturizer does a really great job after cleanser at night
seems to do it's job quite nicely
very nice for the price too.
i love how it makes my skin feel.
alot of moisturizers i tried using always broke me out
the light fragrance always makes me feel like i'm pampering myself
i do notice this really tightens it up
when i seen all the great reviews i figured i was going to try it
it smells sooooo good
have to be careful about what i put on my skin
this really changed everything!
i love everything about it
it does nice things for my skin
not sure there is enough retinol to really make a difference
makes my face feel really spa like
it also does a great job at not creating an oily feel or look
pretty pricey for what you actually get.
i like this product okay.
i felt i wasn't getting enough hydration
i really like this cleanser!
i feel like my skin is actually healthier
overall, i liked it, but it is very pricey.
i think i've found the "one"
this stuff right here is the truth
this does the job of cleansing really well
honestly there is no going back for me
the feel of my skin after using it
i feel in love with it
i love how it feels clean
it really helped my breakouts
my skin has never looked or felt better
i liked it a lot
it's definitely something i will keep purchasing
started with drug store products it was no use because my skin got really bad breakouts in the end
i just have a nice clean feeling afterward.
really gentile everyday wasy.
i really wanted to love this product.
makes my skin feel really clean
i feel my face is very clean.
i love the way this smells and feels!
what really makes this one st
never makes my skin feel tight or really dry
just avoid getting in your eyes obviously ;)
even when i don't use the appliance i still feel like i get a good clean face
i am sure it would be wonderful if used on its own
i will definitely be trying other kate products.
it really gets all the oil
does a good job at taking off my makeup
i can definitely tell a difference in my skin when i don't use this
my skin actually cleared up really well
and your face really feels clean after i use it.
while the cap is weird i've gotten used to it
i also really wanna try the new eradikate cleanser that just came out
together they do wonders to my skin
i really love the scent
i feel like it really gets the dirt off
my confidence is through the roof because i'm not worried about the condition of my skin
my friends are looking at me
it's definitely doing its job
this product is amazing if you have a few blemishes here
it's way too strong for me to use everyday
i really love the twist cap!
anyways yes i will definitely be repurchasing this product
physically touching it didn't feel so great either
other than that this cleanser is soooo great
i feel like i'm late in the game of trying to figure out acne products
every time i try something else i always go back to kate's cleanser
it does an amazing job of getting off makeup
my acne started to get really bad again about 3 months ago
i really really like it.
i definitely recommend it
my skin just wouldn't feel as happy without it
my boss always gets free stuff.
keeps my skin just right
this has really helped clear up my skin
i feel like it wastes product.
this stuff works for me
really don't care for it because i feel like some of the product is wasted
i feel like it really helps my acne
its definitely helped my skin
i really do love this wash!
really liking this cleanser
not too harsh, love it love it!
i like both of them.
it comes out quick i always feel like i get too much
i love the way this product makes my skin feel.
my face still loves it!!
this cleanser addresses pretty much everything!
i am still in love with it
i really like this cleanser.
few products really make a difference
i tried all kinds of stuff
love how it makes my skin feel
it works wonders for my skin
it really feel clean
it works wonders for my skin
i love it its pretty light feeling as well
while i liked the smell
i definitely recommend it
also the tub it comes in is so weird.
has felt like an impossible dream
what it has done for my skin
my skin can go crazy
you don't need a whole lot
kate somerville really does have great products.
this makes my skin feel
i found that it really helped out the flaky
i would definitely recommend this!
i love the light texture it has when going on
it feels like i'm wearing nothing at all.
i really liked this product.
i think i'm going to try the nourish lotion next just to see how i like it
lately i've been breaking out like crazy
this is truly the only moisturizer that has worked for me
always struggled finding a good moisturizer
my skin has never felt so smooth.
i really love it and recommend it!
some other issues my skin started to do funny things again
i love the way it feels
i definitely recommend it!
that is just a opinion some think smells good
i would definitely recommend this product
really like this one
the one thing i'd like to see added is some spf because i'm going to need to switch to a different moisturizer for the summer
this stuff has changed the game for me in the moisturizer department
so the product is definitely not for everyone
like all of kate somerville's products it works really well
felt good on my skin
i also really like the packaging
this stuff is great because doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy after use
i am a little worried that it won't be able to hydrate my skin well enough in the cold
i love that it made my skin look
this one really checks all my boxes
i literally feel like my skin is glowing in comparison to how it was before
i like to try new things
for my combination skin i felt at first that it would make my face tacky
my pore thank me very much :
it just feels like your skin
has pretty much cleared up my acne
whatever this stuff is amazingggg
my skin care regimen is pretty simple because for me
i am lucky enough to get very few pimples
've tried a lot of products
it gets the job done for sure
my skin looked good after my work out
this product has really helped keep my oil at bay
this product has done wonders for my skin.
nothing else has ever worked for me the way this has
if you are better with benzoyl peroxide then this is a really great product
so great that i had to take the time out of my day to make sure i wrote this review
this product works really well.
don't feel like i'm wearing a ton of product
i always had clear skin so when i broke out i got really upset
now this stuff can be a little drying so definitely moisturize well
i still have some pimples here
i think it's been working pretty well in keeping my skin clear
definitely glad i have it a try.
it really helps keep new ones from getting bad
i've tried everything it seems.
i think this product was okay.
i just want you guys to know that i go through one bottle in 45 days
if you feel like your face is out of control
this keeps my skin pretty to where i don't even have to wear foundation anymore
good things to say about it
i am so so so grateful to the wonderful saleswoman at my sephora who showed this to me as i has a mild breakout of a few pimples on my chin probably from stress of travel
this has literally been the only product to keep me pimple free for pretty much everyday that i use it
my skin has never looked so good
this seems to keep it really nicely under control
i kid you not.
because obviously it hasn't cured my skin or anything
i felt like i needed to write it because ever since i started college
i've always struggled with acne
my skin would always be red
always had a ton of breakouts
i feel like i have to
because it could really help someone
i don't really have a lot of acne
this stuff works miracles
), but it definitely helps keep my pores clear.
this stuff gets close
this product truly changed the look of my skin
definitely helped out with my acne
definitely a staple in my skin care routine
this stuff really works
or when you feel something starting to come up through your skin
this helped me a lot
not to mention my skin tone has evened out perfectly
i’ve actually come to enjoy the physical sensation of putting it on
this is definitely the one to go for
now my chin is really clear
have found some stuff that helps
i find it is especially good for zits that i have popped
i spend so much $ to trying to find a perfect skin care line to help me fight this breakouts plus acne
nothing was helping me
i needed something to really help keep my breakouts at bay
i also don't really like the smell
this product has done wonders for my skin
i really like the pump because it offers a lot of control
i always know how much product will come out
needless to say super frustrating.
it's pretty much kept my face clear
kate makes some very good products
this is definitely one of them
i liked wearing it underneath my makeup to help keep me clear
it has done wonders for my skin
i liked this product because it cleared my acne really quickly
if i feel something starting
this stuff seriously works
ok, a little background for you!
this product has done wonders for me
hope it helps you like it has helped me!
i really love this lotion
my face has never looked so smooth
a chance against this stuff
i feel like my skin is finally moisturized- which when you have dry skin seems like it's never going to happen
one pump really does go a long way
the price is just really heart breaking.
i cant remember the last time that i loved a moisturizer so much
so good to just put on
i decided to cash in points because i heard good things about this
this is just the thing
my skin has a different texture/feel
one thing that i don't really like about the product is the container it comes in
it's amazing and i definitely reccomend it!
it's actually a very nice product that leaves my skins feel very smooth
all of her products work so well for my skin
i really like that you actually feel like its nourish in your skin
my makeup goes on so nicely over it.
i really like this product
the only thing i really don't like about it is the smell
it has done wonders for my skin
i really liked this moisturizer.
i liked it a lot
there really is no scent
i am not quite sure will it work out for me
but the smell is really not good.
as well it does not feel heavy or like anything is laying on top of your skin
works so well for me
my skin looked so good the next day
i definitely can suck it up
i'll admit it feels great on the skin
my skin is looking like it did
with a really stressful time at work my skin changed
so glad i found this stuff!
i liked it this time
four stars because i really don't like the container
'm happy with that given how hard it is to find the right moisturizer for my skin in hot weather
i always find myself coming back to it
it has truly helped my face stay moisturizer
'm trying again since i love this stuff so darn much
i love it so much my skin feels so good in the morning
he put a little on my hand and i just loved it.
he told me that it would help with my dryness
this product work very well without giving me problems
i really like this cream.
i really love this moisturizer.
really makes my skin feel fresh
the feeling of this after i wash my face feels amazing
i really love this product
i definitely saw a different in about a month.
one thing you do need to know about this cleanser is that it's pretty powerful so make sure you have a good moisturizer
and this is my honest opinion.
its really good at removing eye make up too!
i really like this cleaner
i really like how clean my face feels after using it
i think it smells nice too
it really works and has a greeaaaat smell.
it cleans really well
it's very hard to find something that works.
i really love it!
the only thing that's keeping me from giving it 5 stars
this one seems to be really gentle
usually i can keep it nice
i especially love how my skin feels in this hot
this will definitely help you out w/ that
my skin has never felt or looked better.
it reminds me of when you just get out of the shower
your hair smells really good
this product has really made a difference
love the way it feels
my skin always looks nice immediately after application
i really wanted to hate this because of the price
it works wonders on my skin
my fine lines are definitely fading
this product definitely works without making my skin flush
makes my skin feel great and it looks smoother.
honestly feels like a child's
chest looks good still
the problem with this is that it is extremley heavy feeling
maybe not evern dailty use for those of us with very oily skin
i really love this cream!
while i thought it was a good moisturizer i was not sure if it was worth the $150
said my skin was looking better with kate's products so that's enough for me
this is good, just not for me personally.
for something that helps
i felt that i needed to voice my opinion.
find it really was making a difference
it made me feel very pretty.
wanted to try it out for myself
i definitely notice a difference
so do my friends
love the effects i am getting from it
this one is lightweight but really does the job.
i haave very dark cirles under my eyes
it feels really nice
i kid you not guys, my skin is cured.
it does feel like a bit much when you're first rubbing it in
after trying many moisturizers i stuck with cetaphill because thats what worked the best
the price point is pretty high for me
so, this stuff has seriously saved my skin.
will definitely be keeping it in my routine
at the same time it really likes to have cloggy pores
i would definitely recommend this to everyone to try
so that's always good
nothing about it really bothered me.
it felt a bit hard to absorb
it feels really good on my face
this stuff has gotten me compliments on how clear my skin looks- i love it- no unnecessary ingredients
everyone always asks how i keep my skin perfect
it works pretty well.
it is good stuff though!
this has been so good for my skin this winter
i immediately feel in love with both.
this product really works!
this stuff is proving pretty amazing so far.
it feels a bit like oil to the touch
they seem to pair well together as my skin looks great
loved everything about it
it always felt smooth to the touch
i heard about this stuff
the other thing that made me uncomfortable with it was that it felt borderline sticky
a lot that right with it
i never feel greasy.
i definitely recommend it
really love this product.
my skin never looked so good.
they look great too
the combo really seems to help
it felt like i was putting oil on my face
really like to moisturize at night like most of us
i love that too
it feels sooooo good on my skin
this product definitely did the trick
it makes my skin just feel tighter
definitely give ks a try if you have tricky
everything with any kind of oil breaks me out.
still having acne is just not fair
this stuff is the bomb!
love the way it feels
i can feel a difference in the way my face looks
but i do like the way it feels on my skin.
youth as we know it
i like it a lot
not only does it make my face feel super clean
best thing out there, so glad i discovered this!
seems to work well for me
i didn’t feel like it was really cleaning my skin
that obviously isn’t going to be enough
the thing is this is just a really good cleanser
i like that clean feeling it doesn’t necessarily feel “dry” to me
i really liked the product
i love this as much as it pains me to repurchase it every time i run out
i really love this cleanser!
this stuff is really good!
really makes my face feel clean
my skin enjoyed how the product made that b*baby softeness efect
but not this guy.
i always felt cleansers were the one thing i could cheap out on
smells really fresh too!
the price is definitely up there
i honestly thought there was no way to get rid of the little bumps under the skin that weren't quite pimples
my skin hasn't looked this good in a really long time
looked so good since i started using this cleanser
i really like the results
(my skin is not always smooth.)
t's really hard to find this balance between the two
i really like it.
i loved how it felt
i really love this cleanser
i always have a backup of this
i think this is a really good treatment cleanser.
for somebody with a combination skin i've had a hard time finding great skin products
it really does help with any breakouts
i really like the smell as well.
i really enjoy the smell too.
i really feel like this gets every last bit of makeup off of my skin without drying it
their products are just so nice
it literally feels like baby skin.
so with that said
has been going through some weird transition stage
i really like this a lot.
right now my skin is really nice, not so dry.
i really like this line
so glad to have my very own!
i really like this product.
in fact i love the whole amorepacific line.
that is what i really want in a product
i really liked it
we are in love!
i gave up thinking that's just my skin
my skin has been doing good since
definitely try this out!
so for this kind of things you need to be patient
i really love this cleanser.
it does not leave my skin feeling tight at all.
this thing removes everything for me
what a lot of people forget is that you always have to keep your h
what i feel about it <3
overall i really like it
my face definitely feels clean afterwards
the price is definitely up there
my skin has never looked or felt better
i really don't mind the scent
really helps with application- otherwise i was feeling like i was losing a lot of it from the pump to my face
i always like to try new oils
it smells so nice, not overbearing at all.
i feel as if this product really does a fantastic job of removing makeup
let me tell you this stuff is amazing
" which sounded too good to be true
which has always left my face really oily afterwards
definitely recommend this as a great oil cleanser for those who are into double cleansing like me
i know the thought of putting oil on your face sounds crazy
definitely all my makeup
i really liked this makeup remover.
it does feel very nice on skin
it's really made a difference in the texture
also like how it smells.
which is always a plus
which is so hard to find in a product like this
i felt it was too strong for me
is probably great if you like the scent---personally still on the lookout for something better
i really love this cleanser.
it actually feels amazing when you massage it into your skin
i love that it gets everything off
it always made me feel like i was having a mini-spa moment
so you know your skin is getting really clean
my skin definitely looks brighter
it does a darn good job
i keep coming back to ap's cleansing oil because it really is the best
i definitely recommend this product.
this is definitely part of the 'routine' now
:) i also think it makes my face feel softer.
to think a old cleanser would be good for me skin right
i really like the scent
my skin actually feels good without having to re-moisturize right away
mother used to always told me to remove the oil completely you should use the same ingredient
my face just feels comfortable after using this
i love the way it makes my skin feel.
you might have to use a bit more of the product than what the directions call for to really feel like you are covering your whole face
i really love it.
i feel this is a quality product
it feels so nice on the skin
i really like this.
i like it a lot.
everything that comes with
i sure hope i find an affordable option that's similar in what this stuff does because this has been the best gel moisturizer
it feels so good to apply- it has a cooling sensation
it is as good as everyone giving it a 5 star says it is
actually the area around my nose feel hurt
my skin is pretty hard to please
it works really well in both areas
however i think you need to make sure you are washing your face with a good cleanser too
there are so many things i love about this moisturizer
i do think it smells nice
i really love what this has done for my skin
not very good for winter time actually
i really love it
i know people think you are crazy to spend $100 on a moisturizer
it really really helped my acne on my neck
this stuff is the real deal
i think i would consider it worth it to not have to continue searching for something that makes my skin look amazing
plus, it feels really refreshing to apply.
not only does it feel great
loved it so much i'm going to purchase this ridiculously priced gel because it felt like heaven on my skin
my skin feels so good after applying it.
i get so many people saying that my skin looks like porcelain
it always felt so gross.
it works really well
my skin is very weird
my skin looks like i've always wanted it to
made it really oily or made me break out a lot
it's the first moisturizer i have really loved
does not give you break out adding a nice smooth texture to your skin
it definitely leaves me with a fresh face
everything else makes my skin break out
have a hard time finding a good moisturizer
the formula truly feels weightless under makeup yet keeps my skin happy all day long
i definitely recommend it to anyone with combination or breakout prone skin
this stuff works wonders
that kinda makes up for the price.
the first thing i loved about it was the smell.
it does not have the horrible gel feel.
i like everything about it
every time i put it on it feels so refreshing
girl who does my facials says my skin just keeps looking better
people tell me my face looks cleaner
it definitely absorbs well
this is a good product for younger skin especially
i will definitely keep this in my life
i could definitely do without the scent
the moisturizer is so amazing i'll take it any way i can get it
it honestly helped even out my skin tone
this has helped me pretty much completely get rid of any old dark spots from acne
when i've run out i definitely noticed a difference
feel amazingwill use this for life
we know what kind of horrors we face without our much needed beauty sleep
this one really made me believer
i felt it working
could really tell the difference in the appearance of my skin
my skin looks so good that pharell could be singing about it
i truly notice a difference in my skin when i use this
it actually works really well
i think this product will definitely help
i think it also helps balance out my skin
they feel slick on the skin- not this one!
i will definitely keep using this product.
also looks really even
i feel like this product definitely deserves it
i love the way it makes my skin look and feel.
this product has really helped me keep it in great shape
i can feel it is been absorbed by my skin
really notice a difference in my skin tone
i did notice that in my clear areas there was a nice smooth
amazing is the only way to describe this stuff
so, it works for me.
it really does brighten up my skin
definitely recommend for people with damage like me
i love the smell and the feel of it.
somedays i got up
this will always be a part of my skin care routine
this really helps with that
what i can tell you is that my skin feels smoother
i really like this product line a lot.
the results i have gotten has been so great
if it is doing what i think it is doing
it is helping my complexion a lot
it makes my skin feel amazing for like so long
it really improves things over time
there are a lot of products that i like
curiosity got the better of me
one of my favor it was acutally this one i been use for like one months it makes my skin glow
i mean really bad.
'm not sure if others work better
i gave this one a 5 because it really did work
loved how it made my skin feel
it really works for me.
my skin is definitely smoother
i really don't like the way the bottle is designed
it does feel good onm my skin
i've had really really bad acne for years to the point where i had to go on accutane
will definitely recommend it to my friends!
feels good, not too thick.
i am sooo glad i came across this for free because it's one of those awesome discoveries that i never would've even considered purchasing
i really see a difference in just 2 weeks
just some redness here
i guess that i looked in the mirror
i will definitely keep using this
i didnt know what it really was
now i have really bad acne
i really like how it makes my skin look.
it is not unbearable for me, i actually like it.
i love all things murad!
it is hard to tell when you are running out of serum
this stuff really does work.
they really tightened a lot when i was using this product
i don't it really benefited that
my face is honestly so smooth feeling.
she said she asked me because my face really glowed
this product really works
this has really helped
he felt tightening but it wasn't uncomfortable.
obviously i had to try it
so everything i've used in my face has always broke me up
good skin everywhere else
never feel like the results are that great
chin have never felt so smooth
i am very hesitant about skin products because i have had bad acne for as long as i can remember
this product definitely worked for me.
i'd say this is a really good product
so that's fine with me
thought they worked pretty good
this is really good stuff!
but a girls gotta do what a girls gotta do!
i get spots on my face pretty easily
i can feel the product really cleaning out
it really works to pull my blackheads right out
i guess thats because it's a great product that i use a lot
you feel such a great clean sensation after you wipe the product off
my makeup seems to stay on really well after doing so
have definitely noticed a difference when i use this product
it feels really good to find a product you can really depend on :
it has really helped clear up my skin.
some people might find it refreshing
finally i found a great product that helps me keep my adult acne under control
very smooth after you take it off
i like to think that this is helping with the oilyness
i feel like a lot was wasted with the pump
it really worksi always have those blackheads on my nose
nothing worked very well
my skin has never felt so clean.
this stuff is awesome-- i try to use it at least once a week
you know its working
especially without sensitivei really like that!
it does have a bit of a 'slick' feeling during application
im really considering buying it
it really doesnt take a lot of product to cover the whole section
this sucks them right out
it really does the job
it works really well
i tried it myself
so, decided to purchase a guys product.
maybe guys can h
he swears by this stuff
has everything i wanted in a face product
i love the way my skin feels
it works pretty well and i like it very much
really likes this product
feel a difference with this one
it was hard to convince my husb
he loves this stuff.
i really like it
like it looked in my 30's
see what happens to my eyes
great product if you want something light
yes, this is the consistency of water.
maybe the reason why this is sold with the eye lift cream is so people will think it is doing something when it is really the cream
want an eye product that really works this is it
they used to be really bad
i started using this product because i was sick of people telling me i look tired
it definitely is not meant to be used on its own so be prepared to purchase a good eye cream to really see results
my skin has never looked or felt better!
i can tell that my other products really do work better
if you want great looking skin
my eyes haven't looked this good in years
it seems like my eyes do not look as tired
i would definitely recommend this product!!
but my eye area does feel smoother
i do feel my eyes are smoother looking
i love the way this feels
i can really tell the difference
i will always be brutally honest so you get a great review of what the product claims
so far out of all the crazy products claiming something amazing i have yet to find amazing
even with a brightening aspect the problem always is
this is something i have always come back to for under moisturizer
this product does everything pretty much that it claims
the way it makes my skin feel
love the way it makes my skin look and feel.
people cannnot believe how beautiful my face looks
i get a lot of compliments on my skin.
i love how my skin feels with this item
i can honestly tell you that my skin looks ten years younger
my skin hadn't been looking nice in some time
think that i am going to really like this product
overall i definitely look younger with these products
see what you think
i really haven't used this for long
feel these products will help even out my skin tone
told me that my skin looked really good
which is a pretty wow review
her opinion made me positive i wasn't just imagining those improvements
if i wasn’t already using the other perricone products i’m sure that i would have found this to be a really good product
it really does lift your face.
for me i'm in love
i love just about all of the perricone products i've tried
it feels like my skin is just drinking it up
my skin always gets compliments because of this product
i certainly see the difference when i run out
definitely can feel as well as see a difference
i love the way my skin just absorbs the product.
i can literally feel a difference from where i apply this product
this product really works.
i expect a lot out of my products
i really do feel that it's helped to stop the signs of aging
this has really helped to turn around my skin.
as i use a lot of perricone products on my very old skin
i still feel like my face just drinks this up
i feel like it just works magic while i'm sleeping
this never makes my skin feel dirty
it really does feel like its "repairing" my skin after all the harsh medicines
i feel like my skin is saying "ahhh, thank you!
i love the way it feels
has always seemed out of balance
believe me i have tried a lot of different br
i think perricone has made a real difference.
i really like this!
love the way it looks
it's a really nice treatment lotion
after you read the directions you will fall in love with this product because it works amazingly on every thing wrong with my skin
if i wasn’t already using the other perricone products i’m sure that i would have found this to be a really good product
especially when they tried that awful new packaging a while back
i always come back to what works
let me start off by telling you that i have consistent acne breakouts
i can feel this stuff working it's magic on my face
love this stuff and will continue to buy.
find it really works
so although it worked great make sure you have a good moisturizer
it has really help control my oil
this really helps to control my oil before a day of wearing makeup
i think this is because it is taking out all the dirt
i definitely recommend doing so
this mask has really helped my skin
it does make my face feel tight
definitely get the clinique mask
i love the way my nose looks right after because it looks so clean
will definitely always repurchase this mask
i like the feeling of this mask after i use it
it really gets all the dirt out of my pore
i feel like my mace is so smooth
if i feel a breakout coming
i make sure to use a good moisturizer afterwards
will use this whole tube to see what happens
when i was younger i didn't really care about my skin
i got this as a sample and it worked pretty good.
i love the improvement i see in my skin in just 2 days
it has really helped me
it literally makes you feel like you have a new face afterward
it makes my skin feel amazing
it has done wonders for my skin
i think it really helps prevent acne
i can definitely tell a difference after i use it
i can definitely tell a difference the day after i use this mask
it really gets deep
i would definitely give it a try
i recommended this to everybody!
this stuff does work
what really helps is the sulfur in this product.
i really enjoy this mask.
the good: when i put the mask on it has a nice tight feeling
it really does get your skin very clean.
i really hated it
would definitely recommend this product to anyone
which is definitely saying something
it really works like a dream.
it feels kinda weird when you put it on
i liked that it was easy to see where you put it on
my skin felt really
point out that this is a pretty good deal
the good this about it was that it was very drying in my problem areas so new acne wouldn't show up
wanted something to balance my combination skin
not sure about the "healing" part of it though
it really keeps your face clean.
it worked really well- i saw a huge improvement in my skin the next day
i really like this product.
i still have a pretty oily face just not quite as bad as before
that is really saying something
it really seems to speed up the healing process.
definitely nice to avoid that smell
i don't find the proudct to feel good when it's on my skin
it leaves my face feeling really nice
so that's a big plus for me
this makes your skin feel amazing
it felt so good on
when i started using this i could instantly feel the difference in quality
i feel it makes me look so much younger
i really want to keep using this
i really wanted something that was going to "do what it says"
this stuff really absorbs into the skin
i like how it feels on my skin.
i do not see a big difference in my skin
i am going to try a different cream for awhile
i definitely see the difference of my skin
i wanted to love this as much as i loved the eye cream
i started getting compliments on how nice my skin looks
this really is"the creme".
you only need one pump for your whole face
i think since my skin looks so good that also makes it look younger
it plays very well with my makeup
when the riche version came out in the jar i felt like i liked that better for some reason
since coming back to this i kinda feel like i'm seeing better results plus i dislike always sticking my fingers into a jar
on nights when i don't feel like doing every single step
one thing i must also add is that i have really been making sure to keep myself very hydrated with water
this product really helped balanced my skin
i honestly think it made my skin glow
i would definitely buy this cream just to use for that
this cream definitely feels like i am pampering myself when i use it
i felt really beautiful when i looked at my reflection
i really love this cream.
together i think that they do wonders.
my face quickly absorbed this stuff like crazy
my skin actually felt like it needed it!
i loved how my face felt right afterwards
don't really get why people think it smells bad
face cream in 1 so your getting a lot for your money
i can really see a diference in my face
my skin really loves this one
will definitely make room in my beauty budget for this one
i got a sample of this after reading about it on a beauty site i knew that it was really expensive
this is what i thought a
i feel like it reduces the look of lines
i love what it has done for my skin.
at first it seemed to just be a good moisturizer
my skin has never looked this good.
the smell was a little weird
your skin will thank you for it
i feel i have found what i want in this cream.
are you really not going to use something that is great just because it smells for a couple minutes?
because it truly stays with me all day
this stuff is really expensive
probably because the product is good
'm sure with continued use i will see even better results
which is great because i really love the results i've seen with this cream
you know there is still quite a bit in there
for sure a wow cream.
i wanted something that would balance my skin
i feel like i have a new face
i feel like this was the skin i was meant to have
the skin specialists at sephora have told me they feel it's better than la mer
my skin never felt better
luckily, the product is working well.
this one makes my face feel great
this made my skin feel amazing
this works so well for me
i do get so many compliments
ever since i have been doing this my skin looks amazing
$30 there trying different things
leaves my skin feeling so nice
soooo i go to see how much it is to order it aaaaaaaaa
im so sad too because it instantly became a huge part of my morning regimen
im so sad but i will save up and get it!
when i think of the dozens of things i've tried
i can see the difference in my skin
i can feel myself age 20 years every time i step outside
people have also been asking me what i'm doing differently because my skin looks so great
i knew it was too good to be true
maybe my skin even drank this stuff in
will definitely try to make this part of regimen from here on out
the gal at sephora talked me into trying this wonderful treatment that did 10 things in one serum
i really think it's helping to calm my red
yes smells pretty bad
but it always goes back to the blemishes.
some people say this stuff has a strong odor
i know everything looks
love what it has done for my skin
my skin wasn't looking good
everyone i know who uses it loves it
it made my face feel
there is a faint smell that honestly
this one really is something i could not get used to the odor
i never get great results from anything
going on week two and it's still amazing.
so some people smell it
it definitely does not smell like fish.
ok i just had to write this because i was really scared to try this because of all the talk about a terrible odor
i like to think my sense of smell pretty reliable after all i did work for a high end fragrance line
who thinks everything smells funny
honestly the smell takes about 5 mins to wear off
i already love the way my skin feels
i feel it works best over night making my skin softer
the other cool thing that i discovered is that it works quite well on my son's acne
this really works, no doubt about it.
this stuff is so good
it certainly has smelled better
i am definitely sticking with this one.
thank you so much for recommending this amazing product
i personally think the product had a pleasant smell
i feel like this product balanced out my skin
you will be in for quite a treat
plus you feel a difference.
makeup is only as good as the foundation you put it on
it has really helped clear my skin up
for my skin it just feels good when i put it on
so first things first...it does not smell good.
know that there is something on my skin that is hard at work making my skin look amazing
been using this product for over a month i have a nice glow fine lines have been disappearing love the smell love the product you need to try
but it has done wonders for my skin!
this product has really changed my skin!
my skin is getting everything it needs
it took me awhile to really get into the concept.
i feel a whole lot prettier
i made a big mistake because my skin started to look terrible
feel a change in my skin
really, really good stuff.
just good stuff in there that my skin soaks up
within a week or two my skin tells me that it was a bad idea
but keep a couple things in mind.
hard for me to believe that this one product completely balanced my skin
i needed something for all of those things
i do not like a lot of stuff on my face
so what may be great for some may not be great for others
t was a very nice surprise to see this product actually work
because i am a person who likes to keep my life simple i wanted to keep my skin care regime simple as well
this comes pretty close.
s i looked in the mirror expecting to see a tired old hag like i normally do -- you can imagine my surprise when i actually liked what i saw
this stuff is life changing.
have always gotten compliments on my skin
well i tried it and there was a smell to it.
although i have never really liked it
this ceam makes my face feel so smooth.
now that my skin has changed a bit i don't feel it absorbs as well into my skin
if i feel i need a little kick i'll buy the serum as well
see what you think
i think these things make it pretty special.
it goes like this.
so i tried this moisturizer and i just love it!
because you're pretty much just putting in bacteria from your face
i don't really mind
not sure about the brightening part though
so we will see how it evens out her skin tone
when i was younger i had really bad acne.
i do feel that it's working
we want to see results fast
i really love how this product is not oily at all
i would definitely recommend it.
i think its working very well
so yeah night cream for the win!
this stuff does what it says.
my skin is so dry that i feel like i still need a
i think it has actually made a difference in my skin tone
this works really well
so deal with the smell cause this stuff works!
since i have been using this i really have seen a difference in my skin
it dosent smell bad and it goes on really well.
this stuff feels great going on!
definitely what i can feel
i wanted something with spf
i see myself using way less foundation
really like the outcome
i also got a lot of compliments that my skin looks brighter
love how it feels going on
i find this moisturizer really does even me out
love the feel of this.
and i have tried a lot.
this stuff really does the trick
believe me i've tried everything
this is one of my go-to products, for sure...
over your whole face because out does the work for you
i really like this moisturizer
it makes my skin feel
i liked it because it was light
it definitely helps even skin tone.
i would definitely recommend this product because of the feel of it on your skin
feels so good when you put it on
so when i wash my face at night i still look good for my bf :
i really liked the moisture this produce provided
felt good that it has spf 20 in it to protect my skin on days i chose not to wear foundation
i am looking foward to seeing how much of a difference it makes with correcting some sun spots
this cream definitely even your skin
i really love this.
i really like this cream
can already tell a big difference in my skin
my boyfriend who also loves this stuff
my skin looks very even
it really evens out my skin tone.
it has not really done anything to improve the few light brown spots i have
i really like this moisturizer!
i think this product makes the skin look heathier
it sure isn't hurting it
liking what i see
i really like it
it is doing something
but, i feel like otherwise it's a good product.
it took me 3 years to really see results from eye creams
i really like the way my eyes look with this
i got a little scared
there are some that aren't so great
i would definitely recommend it
seriously everything i have tried always does a great job of moisturizing
the reason why i am giving it 4 stars is because i do enjoy the texture
my whole eye are feels so smooth after.
i really love this.
it feels so good when i apply it.
it definitely helps with fine lines
i will say this is nice product
that's when i really noticed the difference genifique had made on my skin
i can't believe how great my skin looks.
i am not sure if it is the product or me because lately i get irritated under my eyes no matter what cream/serum i put on
i love lancome, so i am sure it works.
you can really see its effects
looking at people my age who don't really use eye creams i can see a huge difference
i think this product is really helpful on my fine lines
it was such a great compliment when i wasn't wearing any makeup to have my mom tell me my eyes looked brighter
i really needed something good!
i can see a difference especially right above my cheekbones- which is where i see the most lines
i really love this stuff.
i really like it
it brightens the under-eye area really well
i don't really notice a difference with my dark circles
i just love the way it feels on.
thank you so much!
i really like it.
i take like 4 weeks to really see the result
this concentrate has been very good
they are there always
i like it a lot
i do like the product a lot
this is definitely the one for me
this is a very light cream that feels good on the eye
this one really works
am definitely going back
i love the feel
i would definitely try this product!
it does make my skin feel more hydrtated
i really like this product
love how this product feels going on
was working to take away that uh-oh-i'm-getting-older look
boy does this stuff work
plus, a teeny bit goes a really long way.
make me look tired when i'm not
i love this stuff and will continue to buy it.
so definitely don't give up on this if you try it
i really liked this cleanser
i've found it has been really foamy
it seems to be really cleansing
my face feel really smooth
it is seriously amazing is helping my skin out so much does not dry it out
gets the job done.
but my face did feel clean after i use it.
has really helped clear up my skin
this cleanser keeps me oil-free for a very good amount of time
my whole family uses it now
there definitely is a product for any skin type.
my skin feels truly clean after every use!
it takes off all of my makeup very well
you really don't have to use a lot
i do not have to rub hard for my makeup to come off
i felt like my skin was very clean after using it
i am pretty lucky as far as not ever really having any blemishes on my face
i always struggled with breakouts
with this product my face is always so smooth
but my face would always end up super irritated.
it makes my face feel so nice
i like to use this with my clarisonic
i can feel how clean my face is yet
my skin has been pretty clear
you should be good
my skin has never felt so beautiful
to me it just smells kind of like a clean baby?

i look forward to using this in the morning it's a nice pick me up
it's really helping my dark circles
this immediately makes my eyes feel tighter.

i do not feel a sting as others have said.
this really breaks it down
always just above it
this product really works for me.
i love that i can feel it working
i really like this product!
i definitely notice a difference.
i get a lot of compliments on my skin
this product is part of what i can thank
of course if you have a very poor life style
never found one that actually gave me great result
that this stuff "tingles" a lot when you roll it on
this product really gives love
finally this really works
i get very little sleep
this really makes me look better
best thing to do is place it in the fridge to let it cool
feels so nice under the eye
this is the first eye treatment i've really liked
feel like it's worked great for any issues i had
love this stuff, it rolls on nice.
he liked it as well
my resolution i made to myself was to take better care of my skin
they just looked horrible
i does an amazing job at doing just that
this product made quite a difference.
even when i have a great nights rest i look super tired
his eyes are actually getting better every time he uses this stuff
refreshing plus it makes my eyes a bit less tired looking
he loves it as well
just shake it really well
i really don't have issues with dark circles
get it now if you want to look young!!!!
i really like it
not sure how to feel about that.
love the way it feels
i still use this every day because i think feels really nice with the metal ball
i like a lot of things about this product
you'll come to really appreciate this little bottle
you can feel your skin tighten.
this stuff is it
really does the job!
i can definitely see some improvement the circles aren't that deep
it does feel good
this has worked really well for me.
feel like it tightens things up
this feels good going on
that's how much good it does me
really works well for me.
i only use them when i feel like it
that i still see a refreshing benefit
it does give you an awake feel
i don't really get very dark circles around the eyes
so heavy creams under my eye make me look like i have been crying
i always regret it
definitely needed to after using a whole bottle of this product
this makes my face feel so amazing
would definitely recommend it!
t's really hard for me to find products that don't irritate my skin
it can really lack oil
i definitely recommend this
you definitely need to use it at night
when i got this as a sample i was having a really bad reaction to shaving
this cream has really changed the game for me.
patting this product really sink in my skin.
it really is the best stuff
leaves my skin feeling really hydrated:)
how great it made my skin feel in just one use
then i thought that maybe i should get a better quality moisturizer
so when i get reactions on my body it helps tremendously
like my whole life
this is what my skin needs
reviews made it seem too good to be true
this stuff really is amazing
this stuff is healing it so well
you get a lot of product
it is great because you can put it on before bed
so definitely recommend it
it actually goes on really nicely
always leaves my skin looking
my skin felt so amazing
i need it every day especially in winter.
i tried different things
makes one of those too, and that, i love).
wish it had a funner
i put this stuff on it
i also use this stuff on my face as well
t's really hard to find something that works
i still love it
my first impression about it was not so great
this stuff takes the cake!
i definitely recommend it.
i wanted to get something with simple steps he could follow that was easy since men are very inconsistent with taking care of there skin
this stuff is life-changing!
this product really works
i really wanted to love this product
you get the idea
starting feeling the difference
so that was good
so, these two products work very well together.
really have noticed a nice change in my skin in only a week
i really do feel a difference in a matter of a few hours
you can feel the difference after 12 hours.
makes you feel like your sweating in some way lol
it also gave me acne which thank god i always been lucking not having any
at the beginning it felt weird because of the heavyweight
just to see what would work well for my skin
it really does live up to its claims
i love how i feel like it almost heals my skin every single time i use it
i can feel a difference already.
i like that i can really coat my face with this
i need a really good moisturizer
i'd imagine it's life changing for people who need the intensity
so there is no real need for me to have a product like this
it just leave me the whole bunch of textures
during the time my skin is not feeling so great
it is so amazing to me my skin always looks amazing after i use this
i honestly love it and is one of my staples.
also burned really bad
:) i'll try to always keep it handy
it really does help with redness.
i really love it
what i really needed was calming
when i do results are just as amazing
when the lady recommended if i just thought what the heck
in my younger years didn't take good care of my skin
oil crazy lately trying a lot that will help
at this price, this product did really good job.
the combination really helps to even out my skin tone
i know all skin is different
cortizone is my go to for bad reactions
i like my make-up kinda natural
my real use for this product- my legs
it's really not a huge problem for me
the smell is really odd to me
used this product exactly like my sephora rep told me to- a little dab will do right after cleanser
since using this stuff people have commented on how i look less pink
it has always bothered me
you look so different!!"
it felt so good
i am new to serums, but i really like this one!
this really calms it down
what i first noticed about this product was it felt really good on my skin
i've always been a really ruddy person
very nice price for something that actually seems to work
always try to find ways to get rid of it
new brunswick likes pretty skin too
can you tell how pumped i am about this!?
at times i can feel a bit of a tingling feeling
i can tell you that this cream is most definitely changing the appearance of my face
i am very embarrassed by it which causes me to cover it up with makeup most of the time
laugh lines that are making me mad
because of the hard water here
so finding something that works this well is a miracle
i've never gotten so many compliments on my skin in my life
about to tell me i have really nice skin
i told them it's this retinol for sure!
i very much love this stuff.
could definitely tell a difference
i really like this
i love the way this feels going on my face.
this has helped basically all my skin issues.
this works really well.
i really find that using a good moisturizer
they feel very smooth
i just feel like my skin looks better when i wake up
personally love this stuff
this product is really a miracle worker.
my skin feels great after i apply it.
the best thing about it is that it really works
it makes me feel as if i have new skin in the morning
i feel like buying a case of it
i get breakouts here
it seems to not be working as good as at first
i will definitely keep using it
when i wake up i definitely notice better skin
to really notice any big changes
i really love this product!
it does feel nice
me skin have never looked so great!
i started getting all this texture
lack of sleep has really been getting to my skin
i can always tell a difference when i use it.
my skin has never looked or felt better
this is basically all i use at night
i definitely recommend this
definitely give this product a shot!
i love how it feels on my skin.
though i can honestly use just a warm
i definitely recommend asking for a sample before making the big purchase because it is quite pricey
i wake up to good looking skin
i love how it soaks right in
i can definitely see a change in my fine lines
i feel a zit coming i use it that night
i would say this is a very powerful product so really 1 drop is all that's needed
it's working out well for me
i wanted something to help treat breakouts
when i wake up my skin feels and looks amazing.
a change to a pump would be nice
i can really see a difference in my skin
i love the way it makes my face and neck feel.
being that i did have good skin
i do think my skin looks younger
i loved almost everything i have tried
so here is my honest opinion.1.
if that makes sense
i think it has done some good for my skin
yes, it smells awful, but it works so well.
you can start to feel the difference after applying it to your skin
the 3 together are doing amazing things for my skin
said it definitely did not smell nice
sure enough i'm doing great with no peeling
i keep getting compliments on how good my skin looks
in the morning my face was really smooth
well, literally over night you see a difference!
know what i am seeing
my husband can really tell the difference.
nothing ever really rocks my world
it actually feels really nice going on my skin
just as most of us have very fine lines under the eyes when you smile
i started to break out in really weird
i really like the texture
i really see a difference in my skin
i really like it
you can feel it working instantly.
makes your skin look young
who pretty much never disappoints me
if this is basically the same thing
my face always feels so clean
who used to have a blog called stuff i put on myself- bring it back girl
i really like it
i really like this face wash.
really love the shiseido cleansing oil.
you can really feel the oil getting into your pores
my face has never felt so clean
that's a very long time
it's doing its job well.
i like how this smells
but i was definitely wrong!
this one actually smells nicer
as i don't think this is enough to keep my skin balanced
i like this because it makes my face really clean
still works pretty well
the scent is alright, but it could be better.
i never really thought about it before
my face feels really good when i put it on after washing
there are things that
was so happy at how it performed on my skin that i actually re-purchased which is not something i do very often at all
'm not going to take off a star just because i personally have way extremely oily skin when this product is so easy
it is so nice on my skin absorbs quickly
i love how it feels light on my face
how about a break guys
i hope it helps some of you
felt like it wasn't helping my very oily skin
this is a really worthwhile buy for anyone who has oily skin
love the way it looks on my skin
my skin has never looked more amazing
at first i was kinda on my toes about trying this since it is pretty expensive
this really helps my skin stay oil free
the first time i took it off because it made my skin feel awful
this one really works!
it really does a nice job going on my skin
it really gives that matte look
does not break me out and is great under makeup.
i liked this a lot.
i feel like it makes you skin feel like it's gonna crack
this stuff is super
this is definitely a keeper
i really like it.
everyone asked what i did differently because my face had a nice glow
i really like this product
this really does what it says
makes my skin look and feel great.
it definitely gives me a smoother appearance
i really like this product.
this has really helped clear up my skin
this stuff really controls the oil!!!
i really needed something to keep my skin from getting so oily so early in the day
it is definitely helping to mattify my skin.
the stuff really works
i feel like i have tried everything
i love this stuff so much
i think that is really working wonders
i really like this product.
its hard to even remember
she looks gorgeos her face is very lumicent
it's really hard to find a good moisturizer.
that i've noticed my skin just feels nicer
especially not for any face products as i have never found a product that i truly love
i really love this product
this stuff really is amazing
i really didn't have to use alot to get good results
i think it's helped my complexion improve.
at least i think i look like i've been getting sleep
i can see a big difference in my skin when using this product
love the way this makes my skin feel.
was pretty sure it was the miracle
i am just now at that age when the wrinkles really start to show
i can almost feel this stuff plump my skin up when i put it on
i can honestly say that my skin has never looked or felt better
the results for me were pretty quick with miracle worker
still gives you the right moisture the smell is nice too
i mix a bit of my foundation with it
i love that it feels light
i like the texture and feel.
it does look a bit "wet" when you put it on
my skin definitely looked brighter
i needed a really good moisturizer
said "you look like you're in your mid 40's
whatever you are doing, keep doing it".
what am i doing?
found it so good to my skin
feels so good on my skin
i keep being told i look 28,26, even 25!!!!
my skin has never looked this good!
so i knew itd be special.
i like the feel of this product on my skin
yes it may feel "greasy" at first
love how my skin looks
when they see my complexion they tell me about how my cheeks are "glowing"
this moisturizer is the one i always come back to
non-greasy feel and my skin feels great!!!
just seem to sweat right off particularly for day
this one strikes a good balance between doing all the hard work
really massage it well into my skin
really rub it in good
i think you may end up loving it
i feel like i don't need to wear makeup when i put it on
get lots of comments on how good my skin looks
i feel like this is the only moisturizer that i can use day/night without breaking me out
i feel my skin looks good for my late 30's.
philosophy has done that for me.
i just turn the big 50
specially now i really need to take better care of my face
it has been really through a lot
i found something that works well with my skin
love how it feels
i can tell a huge difference in my skin
can tell the difference in how my skin looks
i do think it's improving the feel of my skin
i always had acne
love the texture, and feel of it on my face.
this stuff definitely helps with that
i think it is because i use miracle worker that my skin looks so good
this comes pretty close
makes my skin feel good
it really does pay off
this is definitely going to remain one of my go to products for good
i truly see a difference in my skin.
it does not feel greasy after it is refreshing
i sometimes wonder if it truly takes everything off
it really gets off all your makeup
really does take off the day
it really makes a difference in my skin.
my skin has never felt so clean
i love everything about this
this feels really natural on my face
since i don't find it really helpful when it comes to my eyes
even though i know everyone has different skin types
i feel like it helps my other products soak in better
actually feels quite smooth
make sure your h
it leaves your skin feeling so nice afterwards.
this is amazing it really gets your makeup off.
i always use this when i get my makeup done or when i have a lot of makeup on because it does the best job at getting the makeup off
this one pretty much breaks up your make up
really hoped it would help my skin
i really like this product
definitely a staple product in this skin-care fussbudget's routine
it feels so nice
all day foundation like nothing
i think it takes off a good 95% of my makeup
i am definitely repurchasing as it only takes a little to get the job done
i really like this cleansing oil.
this product beats them all for me.
everything else seemed to irritate my eyes
would definitely recommend it to anyone
never got a "cooling" sensation, but it's amazing
i really like this cleansing oil.
but it gets the job done.
definitely recommend this product!
i loved how it felt
still do a great job at removing makeup
honestly it kind of feels warm when i put it on my face
i do love how well it works though.
it leaves your skin feeling so nice
i really like this oil it takes off makeup so well
my only problem is that every time i use it no matter how well i keep my eyes shut theres like a film left over my eyes making everything blurry
maybe it is just me.
it always remove all my make up even the water proof stuff since this is oil based
i really love it
this stuff does a great job at removing my make-up
she loves the feel of it
i've had a hard time finding a face wash that actually works
bought the little guy to test
dang does it work well
really cleared the acne i tried plenty since as i like to try diff products as a beauty advisor
i switched from my regular murad cleanser to this when i started to feel like i wasn't seeing results anymore
i can feel it working
like i said it feels refreshing
i think i'm going to stick with it for awhile
it is so gentle that you might think it isn't working
especially around that fun time of the month
that combination is doing pretty good
i never had horrible acne
i honestly think it took away my acne
this stuff is seriously amazing.
feel like there is no help in sight
had breakdowns because my skin looked so bad
this stuff is amazing it makes my face feel tight
the only thing that i wouldn't give it 5 for stars is it really dried out my skin
this product actually don't feel that way.
i am always very hesitant when it comes to using products that are specifically for acne because they always dry my skin out so bad even though i am oily/combo
this cleanser is really helping to get it back on track
honestly i think this cleanser was made for me!
in a nutshell this is what you need to know…my skin before i was 19 had:- a good complexion
it works for me!
doing nothing for the breakouts
my skin looks so beautiful i wish i took before/after pictures
even my mom started to notice i was gettin a little crazy looking again
i guess it just wasn't made especially for acne
even though i'll always have a few pimples here
it really has helped
ok i love this product and will always use.
it has really helped clear up my problem skin.
this stuff is honestly amazing!
it works so well for me
the product itself is really making a difference
and this has really helped with my acne!
the lady at sephora thought my skin was great to begin with
definitely give it a shot!
my breakouts were not terrible
and this time i really love this face wash.
she informed me that although it was a good cleanser it just clarified my skin not treated it so she in turn recommended me time realease cleanser
my boss said "you still look sick
i already see quite a difference in my skin
nothing made my face feel really clean like this does
i feel like it gets it all off
this really turned it around
i really liked this product when i first tried it
this really helped with my mild acne
i definitely recommend this one
whenever i get a compliment on my complexion
it is so nice to finally have clear skin!
i can definitely see a difference
never really had bad acne
this has really worked for me
really does help with my acne
felt it was too strong for me
still cleans your face pretty well
this product gives me everything i want while tackling my acne
my skin hasn't looked or felt this good in years
'm curious to see how it would perform on someone 20+ years older than i
mom just to see...).i use it every morning.
take very-very good care of my skin
it is smooth going on
i looked way too greasy
really makes a difference in your skin
because of the good reviews i decided to try it out
finally something that really works!
i really like this stuff.
i really like this cream
think i must be doing something right
i still love it.
bags around my eyes which really bother me
my boss at work both told me that i looked liked i was getting younger
something in it really works!
what the heck, it works.
i am ok with spending quite a bit of money on products if they work
so what the heck
i get a lot of compliments that i don't look 50.
i definitely feel this has tweaked my complexion
you can feel it working
love it made my face feel great have been using it for 2 weeks
hopefully it keeps working and they do!
but it does feel good.
they say my skin looks great
i forgot to add a very important factor.
i've really loved how balanced it keeps my skin
i've had quite a time trying to get my husb
does not feel at all heavy on my face
the fab products have made my skin feel
goes on very smooth so you don't need a lot.
loved the feeling of it
i heard so many great things about this product
i hate the way cream feels on my face
this one feel so nice
i realize everyone's skin is different
i highly recommend this to someone who is at their whits end with their skin it really helped me
it's great under make up too.
really great for those who need to get out the door quick
both products work really well together
this seems to work for me.
i really love it
one pump gets my whole face.
i think people with really dry skin will not like this because it is a bit on the light side
i do recommend it to everybody :)
feels so good on my skin in the morning
it really is great to balance out skin that has been abused with all different kinds of heavy messy moisturizers
i love this stuff so much.
thought it was skin care
but i just needed to hydrate myself.
i love how natural it is too.
a lot of things break me out
this definitely did the trick for a long time
it's definitely my go-to for the winter
i could already feel the difference in my skin
its so light, it just feels good to use it!
so it just depends what you like!
this guy will save you from a bad nights sleep
i don't think it was as good as some of the reviews
its not just relaxing yet depuffing very well
this really has helped me when my eyes are puffy
it works for me
it is a wonderful 2 minute routine before applying makeup if you want to feel refreshed
i really love this product!
i really like this eye roller.
my mom got this for me
it works really well
i don't really have bags under my eyes
i like the feel of the roller ball around my eyes
it feels amazing on tired eyes
also, really there is no glitter in this.
it really does work!
it actually makes them feel better
the cool roller does feel nice under the eyes
definitely helps my eyes look women up
this stuff works miracles
it feels great on tired eyes
it's very relaxing at the same time
dang it makes my eyes feel amazing
it feels so good.
i think it has made a difference there
i always look exhausted
thought it was just stress
the feeling is also very refreshing when you are just waking up
always a drugstore shopper it was my time to get real
i really love it~~~ good for eyes
this has done wonders for both
'm giving it 4 stars
it feels so cool on my eyes
i really love it
this stuff really works, no kidding!
they certainly have done it this time
i really can see a difference
they always look tired
i do like this as it feels really cooling to help with my tired eyes after long hours at a computer
this product really helps
who knows if it does any real good
at least i use it all the time because it feels so good going on
i think it does make my eyes a bit brighter
my eyes always get puffy
my eyes don't look tired in the morning anymore.
i need to use lotion with it as well or my eyes feel a little tight
i don't think it brightens very well
i always get puffy eyes the day after i cry
dark circles that make me look really old
my face looked like i actually had a good night sleep
love how it feels.
i already love the feeling of how it makes my skin
i *am* doing something different.
i suppose my skin looks better since adding shiseido into the mix
i loved the feel of this on my face!
the texture is is hard to explain.
this stuff works all day.
in one week, i really noticed a difference!
honestly one pump is plenty
she kept saying my skin looked really good.
i just knew it was going to be amazing
it always makes my skin look like i got a great night's sleep
sample i received of this product has been doing some pretty amazing things for my complexion--which has a tendency to be dull
i just love the way it makes your skin feel .
maybe because the refining essence had my skin in a good place
together they have worked quite well.
have really seen a difference in the way my skin looks
i received a few compliments that my complexion looked really good
that's all i needed to go buy the whole bottle.
my skin really does feel lovely in the morning.
i think it's a really nice product
felt a difference with my skin
my skin looked lightened somehow in a good way
i love the way it makes my skin feel
with a "primer" type of feel
i still found it to be a good product
i really like this product.
it doesn't work very well
i don't feel like i have anything on my face
really needed to cover it
this product just makes my skin look
itdoes everything that it says it does for your skin
it works really well under makeup
has it looking like i think it should
that my skin looked like porcelin
the first thing she said was wow
what have you done different??
i don't feel the need to wear makeup every time i think of leaving the house
i feel like it has tightened
love the way it makes my skin look
you really do see results almost instantly.
i feel like it could be worn under makeup really well
i really love how my skin look every time i wake up in the morning
it feels so comforting
it feels so nice to put it on my face
i've always been on the more oily side of combination skins so the sudden change in my skin thpe really threw me off
i knew it was amazing
my skin has never looked so healthy.
i really like it.
heavy enough for me to feel like it is there
it makes it feel so smooth
i really liked this product.
i like it a lot!
this is just right
i can barely feel anything on my face at all
reminds me of eternity in some way ?
i really love this product
i felt it was hopeless
decided to try it since her skin looked great
even during the winter, my skin felt great.
makes my skin feel great even after a long day in the sun
i can still feel it on my skin in the morning
which is always happen to other moisturizer
it is the only thing that has helped with my acne
it's tough to switch around between different products finding one you love
i read enough reviews of this product to think that it was going to be a great night cream for me
i really am in love with this product
sephora staff is not a big fan of this moisturizer
it also works really well under makeup.
it makes my face feel so good.
it feels so good on the skin
so for me it was very good product
the fact that i noticed it working made me fall in love with it
it seems robe making a difference for sure
it was patchy and it did not look pretty at all.
i found that this cream really helped to even it out
which is definitely a plus
i gave it four stars because i feel like there is a possibility of something better out there for the price
this really helped to minimize
just started using this product and loved it!
especially helps when you work long
the only thing that truly works on puffy morning eyes
really like it as well
after trying bliss' "youth as we know it" night eye cream
this cream can do everything for me!
i feel like a super model when i use it
made me believe eye cream really does make a difference
this one does both pretty well.
especially on those mornings when your eyes look
because you can feel it lifting
it feels refreshing too.
its really a miracle it lasted me about 4 months really does help with the dark circles
you get a pretty good amount that lasts awhile
i also really like the texture
i feel it lasts agood long time
i never really thought much about eye cream
i must say this really brightens my eye area
the title of my review says it all really.
i really like this eye creme.
i always have trouble w/ the skin around my eyes: almost everything makes them burn
i really like this product.
it is really refreshing when it is cold.
it seems like some people are having a reaction to something in this
i definitely did not get burned
i actually love a certain aspect of this product- it is perfect for mornings when you are going to apply makeup
feel i may actually buy this product to use in the am
it makes it hard to get my contacts in
it's a bit pricey but i definitely recommend it.
my eyes look pretty normal
it's definitely a sorbet like feel
try it and love it.
i can see a big difference in my dark circles
this has made quite a difference around my eyes
this product is definitely pricey
i found myself trying something else
honestly, i really wanted to hate this product.
it always breaks me out
my pores just get a little congestion here
it didn't feel like my face...it was so lovely.
i remember i felt that it gave me vivid
i really milked it.
i feel it is sooo helpful for my skin
do yourself a favor ladies - feel beautiful!
it really does make a huge difference
my skin definitely wasn't the same without it
i don't care cuz in the long run it will keep me looking young
it's so great my boyfriend loves it too.
hard for me to believe too
i feel good when using it
well i can say this product changed my skin completely even my ex boyfriend was like wow
it really has made a difference for me
my skin really responds to this.
i told you she gave me a good head start
her skin hasn't looked this good in years
my skin was still pretty smooth
my skin has never looked or felt better.
as it is a pretty big spend commitment
felt like i was cheating by trying this
but it is definitely a staple for me!
it seemed like a good idea at the time
i really haved tried them all
this is actually a good value because it takes very little product for your whole face
never really found one that wowed me
i really love the way this serum feels on my face
from first application i could feel the difference in the texture of my skin
i only do it when i feel strongly about something
also really like the fact that this is a gel
every time i go anywhere i am complimented on how i have such nice skin
to know that it is protecting me from all the toxins in our air today is great
it is the first time i've used a product like this where i feel like i can actually see a difference in the brightness
never really felt motivated to review anything until this gem
this product really changed my thinking on what dior can really do
i tried so many things for acne
i really like this product because it makes my skin feel very smooth
nothing really works for my skin except this one
im pretty sure that if i would of kept using it it
it's been added to my am
it really is fading my dark spot
i would definitely recommend this product.
it just takes a drop to do my whole face
the way it feels
i love the way it makes my skin look
definitely can see improvement after use.
i knew that sephora had an awesome return policy if it did not work out for me
i wanted to try it so bad because of all of the great reviews
now i have found something that isn't even for acne that works perfectly
feels so good i think i am going to put my makeup on right now
although i have pretty good skin to begin with
pretty badly if i may add
it has really helped me tremendously with my acne
this stuff really makes my skin feel so soft
i really love it.
you use so little of the product to get a nice
just make sure to use a very
my skin has never felt so smooth
there is something about this cream works with my skin
that no matter how great the product is
it literally made me look younger.
this cream does what is says it will while feeling
this stuff is a miracle worker and it works fast.
i try to keep my skin as young looking as i can
because it's nice too for my job
the feel of my facial skin the next morning tells me without looking in a mirror how healthy it must look
i feel like i've already noticed a difference
i think this eye cream has helped
it makes my eye area feel really velvet smooth.
this stuff is magic!
i've always had a problem with the area under my eyes
never really noticed a difference
i do think the jar will last me quite awhile.
if i don't use it my eyes look terrible
i feel great that i am doing the best foe my eye area by using a product that addresses so many signs of aging without it feeling too heavy
everyone said it works
the first thing i noticed is that the smell is not as bad as every one says
my eyes feel so hudrated in the morning after
it seems to really work well with the other eye treatments i use
was hesitant because of the reviews that it smells really bad
this stuff works perfectly for me.
this stuff is the real deal.
this product really works.
it helps with everything
this stuff truly works.
i felt like it made my eyes a little puffy
all eye creams i ever used were not good
this stuff really helps minimize it
i can feel the difference from where this cream was vs where my other moisturizer
i can tell you that this cream really works
it is something i noticed works over time which is good because then i know it is really working instead of just faking it
this is pretty darn close
my circles always bothered me a little
i really really really suggest you get his cream--your eyes deserve it
it works really well
i definitely saw results
wasn't really doing anything to improve my situation
you see results really fast
it disappears pretty much right after you apply it
see this 48 year "young" woman's eyes yourself
feel that it has helped my puffy eyes
the added bonus is that it is cool when it goes on my skin
makes my skin feel tighter instantly
i liked almost everything about this cream
this product definitely makes the under eye area look smoother
i can see a big
if you can suck it up in the name of looking amazing
i don’t care how bad it smells because it has done wonders for my eyes
they tell me how great my skin looks
this product really does smell bad.
i think i do see a difference around my eyes.
which is important to me because i’m always in a rush in the mornings
all i know is that my eyes look brighter
i can really tell the diffense in my bags!
i love how you can put it all around the eye
it hasn't really done anything for texture
i really like it
i really recommend it if you have some dark spots
this stuff works like a charm!
after dried it is really nice
spf is always a plus
it does not make me feel greasy
this lotion has really made a difference.
i am really loving it
which is why i really like this one
i truly see a difference on my skin it also feels soft
i feel it takes awhile for it to set into the skin so a little goes a long way
literally say "i love this stuff" i feel so grateful that my daughter introduced me to this product
it smells really bad
so many spf products break me out that i'm scared of trying them
am not sure how well it wears under makeup
i both really like this moisturizer
so finding something that works great for really dry
i heard a lot of good things about this br
this cram makes my face feel great
i really love this product!
this works for me
it has ingredients that are actually good for your skin
feels like it has a light oil in it
love the way it feels on my face
it absorbs well and does not feel greasy at all.
i really love this line of products
gotta be careful with what i use on my face
i always broke out really bad since i was about 12
it feels so good when people now say oh you have beautiful skin you dont know anything about breaking out
i love this line because everything i've tried is gentle
i've always had a hard time finding a good lotion with spf
i know that i'm doing something to protect my skin
especially for busy working moms like myself.
i appreciate the spf, too.
just really good moisturizer
the solution is pretty watery which i don't really like
i love how it glides over my skin without me having to rub my face too hard
i like it a lot!
also, there is no weird smell, which is a plus.
i like this product a lot.
i definitely wouldn't say this product would be ideal for all skin types
really love this stuff.
to my surprise it worked really well
really got those toxins out
so that's a big deal to me
so for a start let me just complain about all the weirdest things that my skin is
some of them also made me breakout like crazy
i don't feel a thing after i put it on
of not really helping my skin clear
i found out that you really do need it
i feel like i am wearing nothing on my face
i definitely feel like my redness
i really liked it at first because it keep my skin moisturized
i like this cleanser quite a bit.
what i don't like is that it is pretty thick
i really love it with the gel cream
told me she was going to treat me like a sensitive client
said proactiv was really harsh for the skin
my daughter has very fair skin
this one did not making me feel tight or dried out
it definitely should be
you can feel the medication working
i still find that i will get a small pimple here
told the lady that i needed something that really needed to work as i was trying to get myself off of proactiv
was really afraid that my skin was going to have a freak out
even when i feel the breakout coming under the skin
heard great things about the ren line
it seemed a really good product
this stuff is so gentle
i see myself using this for a very very long time
it feels so nice on the skin
i feel like i am constantly trying new cleansers to try
so far i am really really enjoying this
i just feel that for my 40+ year old skin
i'd like to find a product like my old one that also helped my skin's texture/firmness
i love the way it feels
this stuff is ridiculously good.
my skin was freaking out
it really helps balance out all of the oils
i enjoy this product in terms of how it makes my face feel
am hooked on the stuff
has really helped me
it's really actually natural
this is really really gentle
i kind of like the smell.
my skin started freaking out on me
get it back under control: this product really helped
they all made me really oily
really keeps my oil under control
i really love the smooth
i just feel although my skni has cleared up greatly
i really like this cleanser.
making sure my h
this definitely helps keep that at bay
have to think that this cleanser is a big part of that
if you already have good skin
it finally feels like i've found something to help
it's really helping my skin clear up
it's definitely helped with my acne
give this cleaner a chance it could totally change your face
i've always had problem skin.
i really like this cleanser now
makes my skin look really fresh
i definitely notice a difference in my skin when i don't use this product
any age, guys or gals-we all use this now.
the combination is the skin i have always longed for
i really like it
the packaging is really nice too.
i like it a lot
now i actually really enjoy it
ren obviously knows what their doing
my skin has never looked so clear
everytime i try another cleanser my skin doesn't feel quite right
my skin hasn't looked this good in a long time
told me my face looks almost "perfect" now
i recommend you give it a chance because it's good stuff
even really high end stuff
it has really help my skin
just like it says
love this- definitely try it out.
i find that the combo of all three works pretty well for me
it certainly helps keep the breakouts away
i can say my fave looks calmer
and it's pretty high up there too.
i feel like it has not done anything for my acne
thought i would give this a whirl especially because it helps dark spots
think it works ok.
this stuff really works!
where this product has done wonders
so definitely pat it in.
i don't always use it bcuz i do feel like i wake up with oily looking skin
the amount you get isnt a whole lot
this product really helped me out!!!
which she told me a little goes a long way
i really like it a lot
my skin is in love with it
i can honestly credit the healing speed
have never found a moisturizer that i liked
i really love this cream
i like the way this feels on my skin
i like the way it smells
it made me feel clean as well
i really like this gel because its moisturising enough without feeling too heavy on my skin
it feels so refreshing when first applied
it felt really nice on the skin
i love everything about this
the smell took me quite some time to get used to
i find them to be a good pair for someone with problem skin
this cream really helps my skin out a lot !
i think it was a good value
after a long day of makeup my face really does feel more "comfortable" with this on
you still feel it's doing its job
t's really hard to tell what has worked
it has certainly helped me
i feel like this product kind of counteracts itself
i feel like i've tried everything since i was in high school
this definitely needs one
even though many people below me already talked about how lovely this product is
as that is when my skin gets really
this is definitely a must-have product for me!
i don't have words for how wonderful it is to look in the mirror
obviously still healing internally
i don't feel like i've really noticed a difference in terms of it clearing my skin
it's really, really great.
it really helps make your skin feel comfortable
it left pretty bad scarring
i love how my face feels after i use this
my skin seems to love them all
i like how the texture is
my skin felt really smooth after.
i think that this is a good black mask
i really love this mask
this mask really works well.
i can feel my smoothness of my skin right away!
definitely recommend this product
wow is it hard to get off my face
not giving it a bad review because it actually is a good product
it does sting my eyes because i am very sensiitive
this is not the mask that have been seen on social media lately which basically pull your face off
well i will say it obviously hurts like a donkeys
i really wanted a peel off mask
i tried this just for fun
sure enough it works amazing now
really pulls stuff out of my pores
i feel that it is a great mask i feel like with this br
the only reason this is getting four stars is i don't feel you get enough masks out of the bottle
really does make my skin feel smooth
i would definitely recommend it
after a few uses i think the product works really well
although i do love how it leaves my face feeling
i feel like it does help to smooth my complexion
blackheads allowing your face to breath for a whole new feel-good life
you can tel "boscia" does a really good job with all of there products☺️
it worked really well!
really good product to target whiteheads
really pulls them all out so well
i got it sample and wow... it felt soooo good.
i wanted this to work so bad especially for the $$
it does feel a tad bit greasy
this is it for me :)
will keep repurchasing this guy!
they work very well together
definitely keeps the fine lines
a lot of people don't think to protect that area of the skin
i think my skin looks brighter
actually smells nice to me
i really like this day cream because it makes your skin look amazing
you will feel this in your skin.
so not only does it do pretty well as a primer
i loved how it felt on my skin
i still love it
i really like this product
i could feel the difference
feels just oh so nice
this just seems to work for me.
i do very little, but i do us ole henriksen.
i can't say enough wonderful things about ole henriksen products for my very troubled
my dermatologist told me to give the moisturizer up for awhile
i felt like going back to ole moisturizer
my skin had started to breakout terribly
i do feel it played a role
i don't feel the product
i really love this for hydration
love the light feel
being regret because i tried to find another good one
smell like oranges i was hesitant at the beginning because i love my benefit moisturizer
i really like this moisturizer.
i also like the way it smells
it is hard to make changes
i definitely recommend it
i am very picky when it comes to what i put on my face
i love the way it makes my skin feel light
wanted something with spf
really makes my skin feel young
if that doesn't bother you then this really is a wonderful cream
i've had a tough time finding a moisturizer that meets all my needs
i love the way it makes my skin feel smooth.
this one is actually working.
i can say the face looks pretty busy
i look like i got some good sleep.
it instantly makes your skin look better
and smells just like it.
smooth this made my face feel after applying it
it definitely makes me look 20 years younger!
was so surprised to see that my acne started to heal very quickly
i find my skin does look
this really does help - and pretty quickly.
i actually feel comfortable for the first time leaving the house without makeup
i can for sure feel the difference in my skin
i like to think of myself as fair
i'd like to start using it on my whole face because so many customers love the texture transformation that occurs
i am 61 and this makes my skin feel like velvet.
this stuff seems to be doing the job
people keep making comments about how good i look
i really think it is helping
clinique is really coming though for me
i feel like i go through it pretty fast
seeing her skin made me think twice about how my skin looked to others
my skin hasn't looked this great since i was 15.
that was freaking me out
love how this feels on my skin
i can tell a difference in how my skins feels already
it really does reduce the appearance of fine lines
i would definitely purchase
i can assure you that your skin will feel softer
i would say that my skin has really never looked this good
i always wonder if i'm just seeing things or if a product is truly working
has said many times how good my skin looks
i feel that we made a really good choice
felt smoother for sure
hopefully it's not only the serum working
not only did my skin look a heck of a lot better
i also love how it makes my skin feel.
one of the skin specialists at sephora always helps me
i do feel my skin is looking better
for it wasn't really brightening my eye
i liked it as a primer for my makeup in the eye area
i do think this makes my skin appear brighter
this stuff is amazing -- i actually noticed a difference in my skin after the first night of using it
do you suppose the three of them don't work well together?
i do think this regimen has helped my skin
it literally feels like
felt compelled to share how great this eye cream is
definitely feel it's a major part of keeping a youthful skin
always have been a fresh product fan
this cream feels great once you pat it in to the under eye area
looks especially good first thing in the morning.
i really like this because it hydrates
they have never really worked on me
it is definitely soothing
it does feel good all day
it makes my eyes feel amazingly hydreated
i love this, and is here to stay.
i never used eye cream in the past because i never found a product that i really liked
the price always made me feel too guilty
just make sure it is the tiniest bit
it does a really good job of smoothing my fine undereye lines
sometimes i find that a product will quickly give me great results
my eyes look and feel great.
i feel decadent putting it around my eyes
really good for the winter months
the price of this hurts me to my heart.
i really, really like this moisturizer!
it's awesome honestly was talked into this product at sephora i'm all about the beat give me the best
it has honestly changed my skin so greatly i had to splurge
it never felt right
i feel like it was a very good investment!
never makes me breakout
it definitely has a scent to it
my makeup goes on so nice after applying this.
my skin will thank me for it
i will say it's the only moisturizer that has done the job for my skin i have very very dry skin
this really hydrates it really well through out my day
can show you guys
my four head area always felt rough
i feel my skin getting better after using this skin product
will definitely last you a very long while
investing in good skin care is something i don't mind
it made me realize how great moisturizer should feel
i love how this feels for a night cream.
i really feel like my skin got a good treatment every night with this product
i would definitely recommend.
i really love this moisturizer.
everyone here loves it!!!
it makes my skin feels so nice
if you struggle with dark circles you should definitely pick up a sample of this
it has done wonders for my skin
that's a huge endorsement since i'm pretty particular about what i buy
i feel the difference
this moisturizer is actually just like the description says
i could feel a difference in one day
yet still makes my skin feel plush
instantly makes your skiin feel sooo good!
the reason i gave the product 4 stars is because it made my skin quite shiny
it also really helped the lines developing at the corners of my mouth
otherwise i find myself always going back to this cleanser
it makes my skin feel so nice right before bed
i think it smells really good
never learned what it meant to really really cleanse my skin
i think that this product works perfectly with it
the whole being nineteen thing certainly helps with how soft my skin usually feels on a daily basis
my skin never feels tight which is a plus
this stuff really works
noticed my skin feel
this is a good product because not everything is for everyone
looks like it's more good then bad
this is also good if you don't want to wear primer
make up goes over it really nice
i feel like the results are getting me my money's worth
i gave it a good rating because i did love it when my skin wasn't so dry now
my combination skin responds really well to this product
it really worked wonders
it held up really well
i love everything about it
this cream is doing wonders
i never really have high hopes for moisturizers because most of them don't work with my skin very well
it really works as a base for foundation.
it would be nice if it had spf
it makes my skin feel really good
this always kicks it in the
returns my face to a really balanced place
i keep kicking myself for doing so
i really liked this moisturizer.
goes on quickly and makes the skin feel great;
it makes my foundation go on very smooth
this is a really, really nice moisturizer.
my skin has never looked or felt better
the truth is that it has very little scent which i love
i wanted to love this cream so badly
the smell was really light
hopefully few have this sensitivity because i think it could be a great cream for others
i really like this product.
she had me try it on my hand, it was amazing.
and i really really like it.
while i've been able to find a couple really good nighttime moisturizers throughout the years
you definitely get what you paid for.
still gives you the moisture that you need especially now that winter is almost here
it just wasn’t the right one for me
i definitely see a difference when i use this
i do not think it is very helpful for fine lines
feel it is good for people who are in their 20's or people who do not have many eye problems
it does very nice work around the eye area
this winter has not been good to my skin.
this is just the right texture
i don't really see big difference
i definitely recommend it
not your whole face
i always thought eye cream was snake oil in general
i just love the hydrated feeling it brings to my skin you can feel it instantly as you apply
it works well for me.
i always find myself going back to this one
really works well for my combo/normal skin.
was definitely looking into adding an eye care product into my regimen
my eye area most definitely is
it's definitely not as good as the extra cream
the value was always fuzzy for me
you can definitely feel that its doing its job
i really like this
my eyes bother me a bit
it definitely gets the job done in terms of hydration
so this stuff feels like it's doing that preventative work needed at this point to keep the skin around my eyes youthful
this is definitely a keeper.
i love how this cream feels.
i do really like this eye cream, but.
it takes forever to really soak in.
this one is it for me
see a lot of difference in my skin
this eye cream really helped!
feels really nice under the eyes
i love everything about it!
it really is a joy to use--makes me not hate washing my face so much
you will feel so clean
especially in the summer because it is perfect to get all the oil off your face
i still use this product because my face feels so fresh
it has really helped me reduce my acne
i would definitely recommend this product for any type of skin
makes you face feel clean does'nt irriate my sensetive skin love the way it really really foams
i will definitely keep using this
she loves it too
other than that, great stuff!
i've never found one that made my skin look any different
i love the feel
em with a very rich moisturiser has been then only thing that has helped me get a h
it has really helped me out
night because i am so addicted to how this makes my skin feel
can definitely tell a difference in the appearance of my skin
that is pretty awesome because even lotions meant for treating acne can tend to break me out
a big thank you to my mother who passed on her good genes to me
definitely notice a difference i use it around my eye area i am 50
i feel better just knowing i'm doing something good for my skin by using this lotion
i love the way my skin feels when i use it
i used the whole thing up on vacation!
my skin hasn't looked this good in years.
a co-worker today even commented on how great my skin looked
so it can really add up price wise.
the only thing bad about it is the smell
i go through it pretty quickly
i really love it
i really love this as a primer.
my face feels so refreshing
you don't really need a lot of product to apply to your whole face
thats cleared up because of this product because it really helps to protect my skin from my makeup
always regret when i try something in its place
i've had people ask me what i'm doing differently because my skin looks great
i don't break up anymore it's great definitely repurchasing
it always has a cool feeling to it.
just feels good knowing it's a primer
it makes my skin feel so nice
i am so glad i went with my gut
i love this stuff so much!
you don't need a lot to cover the whole face
i truly recommend getting a sample at sephora to see how it works with your skin type
since we all know we can return stuff we don't like
i heard such great things about this
but ugh so good.
like actually right now
i really like the way it smells too
it'll work very well
i know everyone's skin is different
it makes my skin so nice
i feel so bougie buying this but it's amazing!!!
this stuff works wonders for me
it helps my combination skin prepare for makeup like nothing else
i definitely love it!
i need to use this if i want to have flawless looking skin
you don't need a whole lot of product
it spreads really well
fortunately the smell doesn't really last after i've put on my foundation
it definitely helps prime my face for makeup too.
it made me look like a greaseball
my foundation has never looked so smooth
and makes my foundation application oh so good.
you can really see a difference on the skin
it's the first product that i can say i've ever really loved for my skin
as a primer this is just ok.
it isn't really a big deal
people always come up to me to say that my skin looks flawless
just the way it looks on the skin
everything i could've dreamed of for a primer to be
she still loves this one
it feels so good going on your face
it locks in my foundation for basically the whole day
liked it well enough
it works really nice that way
i can tell my face looks smoother
some days i don't even want to put on makeup because this product makes my face phenomenally smooth
i wish i could rub this all over my whole body because the effect it's had on my very sensitive
t help on to my makeup very well
he swears by this stuff
i love putting this stuff on my face
i love the way my skin looks and feels .
my makeup was still perfect like i just put it on
i honestly feel you get what you pay for
it makes it feel great on my skin all day long
it does feel smooth
makes my skin feel
which means it works as a barrier to keep all the good stuff inside the skin
kinda just sits on the skin
my boyfriend tells me he loves the way my face smells
it makes my skin feel really healthy.
it's also great when i put a drop in my h
really suits my skin
always appreciate bb's extra face oil
especially when you are on the go
this oil really really works
really want to bring it with me
it takes just a tiny bit to make my whole combo face feel divine
i think my title says it all.
i feel i look at my age again or younger
it gave me back that youthful glow that i hadnt seen for quite some time
seems a bit scarey at first
immediately gives it the feel
i've always had combination skin
i really love this face oil
was really nervous about putting an oil on my skin
this oil is really comforting
i always go back to this product because it really does work
i really liked this stuff!
the best thing about it is that it actually repairs like it says it will
don't worry about rubbing it in really hard
just really find it is the best
everyone liked to comment on how tired i always looked
it really works wonders.
i really recommend this product!
it takes a lot for me to give a cream 5 stars
this eye cream is just what it says!
i it is really helping my fine lines under my eyes
it really is the do-it-all eye product
this cream definitely does that!
i really enjoy this product.
everybody looks at your eyes
clean just feels like it is working
this product definitely works
this stuff does work.
this worked for me and i hope it helps others.
at 52, people have been telling me i look 35.
this is some good stuff.
really hate the little wrinkles by my eyes
feel this review is true
your skin looks so good no need for foundation
my skin was horrible in a very very bad condition before using this product
it was peeling so bad that even after make up my skin looked horrible
it really works if you know how to use it
some days i do use it on my whole face
i still love this stuff
i've noticed that even when i wash it off my skin looks so good
the last thing you want is to do something to your beautiful eyeballs
you could always ask sephora employee which they are really lovely to give a sample for the eyes
with that said it works and i love it!!
you definitely need time to play with this product
i really like it
this product really does the trick
'm not always looking as refreshed as i'd like
i am going to try it with a powder foundation because i feel that might work
he really complimented me on my skin
asking me how i stay so young looking
sometimes we feel left behind
this product truly made me feel young again inside
cool i thought, but then it got tighter.
all my friends thought i had work done on my face
i think i will keep getting this product.
after i use this i like to put the belief aqua bomb on makes me nice
the smoothness of my skin is so exhilarating to me because this product makes me look so young looking
this stuff works really well.
it works really well
this really is a miracle
is especially good when you've had a long isn't
i truly feel like it is a miracle
it's a great product that really makes your skin feel
my fiance' told me to use on my neck too
i feel years younger when i use this product.
i can feel my skin tighten
i finally found something that really tightens my face
i do feel the difference in my skin
i feel it a lot smoother
she says that this stuff is truly an instant firm
it sure looked better
this is definitely a keeper.
it made me cringe a bit
i like how this makes the texture of my skin feel
i am even comfortable without wearing foundation
would be good for people who like to layer.
for 30 days a months there will be 10 days i experience this kind of weird things
i really am a big fan of ren's line
it honestly worked really well for my skin
my redness is also disappearing so my skintone is looking pretty even
in summer i feel especially disgusting
done just what i've always needed a moisturizer to do
it's definitely something that i would purchase in a heartbeat
after i learned that the hard way
i would definitely recommend trying it out
i really like it
i really feel that this moisturizer helped improve my overall texture
i think it smells really nice
it's definitely not overpowering in any way
i really like it
that is what i really like about it
i feel like really did wonders to the my skin's texture
it felt too light
i love the way my skin feels i think i will continue purchasing this
it's awesome to be able to go without makeup for a long period of time
i am very prone to acne basically everywhere
not greasy, feels nice on my skin.
this is definitely going into my "fave" basket
how my skin is
sure enough i got myself a full size.
to say i love this stuff is such an understatement
i don't feel it on my face
i can feel my face tightening
i found it is very good on my skin.
so works well with foundation/glam face
i guess it really depends on your skin.
got multiple compliments on how skin looked
i tried a lot of stuff from sephora so this is # 1 for me
make me feel luxury.
i really wanted to use this product a few times before i really came to a conclusion about it
i can definitely have an opinion now
you'd think i'd have good skin
for now it does a good job
i still use it because i really like the texture
it made my skin feel so amazing.
not only does this product feel amazing
someone else's review said that it smelled bad.
this had been doing wonders for my skin
if you feel like splurging, try this out.
this stuff really makes you skin so soft
i love it and will definitely buy more.
i am really into this moisturizer!
this product is okay
box and i really like this moisturizer.
i think it works well under makeup
my skin has not looked this good in awhile
my skin feels so new
i believe this is a very good product
i really think the sun helps it work on your skin
so fast really says something
this product is the only one that gives me a "wow" factor
it's pretty much just like a bb cream
all the ones i tried seemed really thick
i am going to continue to use this product it's great
especially when i use it on my face
she also gave me a bit of hers for me to really try
people even made comments about how great my skin looked
i really loved the experience!!
i think it really improves skin tone
i honestly noticed a difference in my skin
i really believe this stuff is doing its job
i love what it has done for my skin
thought i'd try this lotion since it has good spf coverage
i really like how it makes my skin look--sort of dewy
i've gotten multiple comments on how good my skin looks
am constantly recieving compliments on how good my skin looks
i really like this product!!
i would definitely recommend this product as it leaves skin feeling smooth
love the idea behind this product!
i love how smart this product is.
but like i said i do love it!
"what are you doing for your skin?
plus friends keep telling me how great i look.
this stuff actually works!
really helps with the peeling
someone who has known me for 15 years just told me that my skin looks the best it has ever looked
this product really does what it advertises.
i really like it.
my face didn't look so great
i am just excited that my skin is doing so well without taking antiobioitcs or seeing a dermatologist
adding in some extra spf is always a good thing
especially for those of us like myself who are concerned with signs of aging
i don't know if it is really improving my skin
thought i should put all this sunshine to good use
so not really using it where i wanted to
this stuff is seriously amazing!
im in love with this roller it just helps me a lot in the morning it makes my eyes look so much better
wasn't really seeing much of a difference
asked me one day if i was doing something different because my eyes didn't look as tired or puffy
love the feeling on my skin!
what really feels amazing is keeping it in the freezer
nothing wakes up my eyes quite like this.
i can tell you that i'm not a very good morning person
it also feels nice rolling onto my skin.
i really was not giving this stuff a chance as my circles are purple
this one definitely made a difference.
i would definitely recommend!
i always look tired
however, this stuff really works.
it is hard to control how much product truly comes out of the tube when trying to apply it on the skin
feels so good under the eyes
feels good going on and my eyes are less puffy.
this stuff makes my tired
one trick i learned that really seems to help is right after you apply it
this product really works!!
feels great going on, too.
with my sllergies it has daved me
i liked this product a lot.
felt it did a great job of making my eyes look fresh
she loved it too
i like this stuff.
when you put it on in the morning it makes your eyes feel refreshing
i could definitely notice a difference
it was very refreshing going on because i kept it refridgerated
my eyeslids are definitely puffy
not only do i feel like it helping reduce puffiness
i do feel it is helping
this helps make me look like i got all 9 hours !
this worked pretty much right away on the puffiness
i love the way it feels
i kept the tube because i like the feel of it
i actually look forward to using this everyday because the metal roller feels very good on the eyes
i just slept hard type bags
i reallly have seen a difference in the puffiness
boy do i feel like a dummy
feels so good when putting it on
well i don't really have "bags"
it actually feels good on my skin
nothing has ever worked for me so that isnt a deal breaker
i think it really works to brighten
love this stuff it really works and east to use
i am actually enjoying this eye gel.
it is one thing that makes me insecure about my looks
know how tough times can be
not being a morning person this really helps wake me up as i'm getting my am makeup routine started
it works pretty well :
this stuff worker like magic!
that's i just like this stuff
i like the way it feels on my skin
my skin seems to be responding really well
it really does seem to catch the light
i do not like the way silicones feel on my skin
have really enjoyed it
leaves you feeling like you have br
my skin has always given me issues
has my skin looking
it adds a really pretty glow to my face
i guess it is a bit on the "greasy" side
you definitely get the bang for your buck
this is sooo so good.
i even got my mom one and she likes it too.
i really like this moisturizer.
i find that it really plumps up my skin when i put it on
and just love the way my skin feels!
who knew that such a great moisturizer was right under my nose all this time
i definitely recommend everyone should try this
i think this one smells just fine
it feels so good going on the skin
it really keeps my skin looking
it really works well with that
i could tell the difference the next morning when my skin felt so amazingly soft
the price is also great for what you are getting
that's what my skin feels like
you don't need a ton of product to get good results
i am good to go

i really like this stuff
i wish it came in a different bottle as i have a hard time getting the right amount
i really like this moisturizer
i really like how this feels on my skin when i apply it
this actually is just as good as it
this product proves you don't need to spend a lot to get a great product
love this stuff...will definitely repurchase.
love how it works
leaving that "overly hydrated" feel on your face -- you know what i'm talking about
probably will work wonderfully for other people.
i really liked this.

knowing it was such a good eye cream
i've always taken care of my skin.
it really brightens up the area too
i felt i needed to with this product because i have struggled over the years trying to find a good eye cream
it really does work.
i really do see a difference
when i saw the price i said..really!
any beneficial ingredients are at the end so that usually means there's not a lot of the good stuff
you really do get what you pay for here
this stuff is like magic.
i really like this moisturizer.
only 4 stars because it's really hard spending $99
i definitely do see the difference
this eye cream is the first that really works
too bad the first eye cream i actually like is $110
'm glad this cream at least helps with the darkness
you definitely don't need a full pump of this product for your eyes
when i'm using this stuff
didn't do a good job of making it look natural
it helps with the bit that i've got
you feel better the moment you apply
it just keeps working for you every day
i really like the texture
feels really good when you put it on
feels so good~~ i love caudalie
i truly couldn't believe my eyes looked so young
my always there dark circles were gone
really liked the way how it hydrates my skin making the wrinkles not so apparent
your skin will thank you for this as we age.
i always notice a difference when i use it.
i get very little sleep
so hard to find something that addresses fine lines
not only did this cream feel good going on
i noticed a difference with this stuff.
i really like this eye creme you only need a little to use on your eye area
i am always on the hunt for good skin care
is the look i am going for.
my eye area was really giving me away though.
i love the feel of this eye cream
this has really helped make a difference
i love how smooth it makes my skin around my eyes appear
it feels the difference
i still really like the cream
so it looks like i gave it 0 stars.
i needed to go to something gentle in a hurry
made my skin feel
this stuff does it.
have found this is really good at balancing out my skin
it really absorbs well
it really does smooth my skin out
for the results it's pretty good
i love how light it is.
would definitely recommend either product
you get a lot of product for the money
i love how light this feels on my skin.
she loves it as well
i really like it
so basically my skin isn't very forgiving
my skin has stayed feeling great even in the winter
it felt great going on
so that's just my skin
laura mercier seems to know exactly how to talk nicely to my pores
they are definitely quality
this stuff makes my face feel amazing!
a few minutes after applying it the skin does feel nice
i like the consistency
it feels great on my skin without feeling so heavy
not really getting your moneys worth seeing i felt i had to put more
it is not rich at all for my skin like i was worried about especially under my makeup
my face just feels so amazing wearing it
it's really a 5 star product.
makes my skin feel
people literally think i'm 10 years younger than i really am
it just seems to do the trick of keeping my skin looking
which i felt would fit my need
does really well with this moisturizer
this eye gel really works
i would definitely recommend this product to my family
this one is under $100 and it's pretty good.
i don't really mind if it sits there for a bit
this product works so well for me
it has mad a very big difference in my fine lines
im so so glad that i gave this moisturizer a chance
i really like this product.
the smell is light but pretty.
i can really see a difference in my lines
what it does do is give you that well-rested look you get after having been on vacation a few days--something i really
i love that it's very light
i definitely see a difference in my under eye area
i'd definitely recommend giving this a try
i just love everything about it
it really helps to smooth the lines under the eyes
i am definitely going to get this eye treatment gel once i finished my sk-ii
my eye area always looks the same
'm not sure if it really helps with fine lines or dark circles
it'll last you a good while
it definitely addresses fine lines
being like wow i like your eye makeup
they just look flawless
she was like nothing
my makeup is the same as i always do i just have been using this cream you got me
my eyes always look dark
nothing really worked as well as they claimed
people always think i'm younger than i am
i love the way it really softens
was so sad when it ran out because it's expensive
this stuff really works
one thing is that i personally don't think amore pacific eye treatments are great for dark circle
i really like that the way it goes on.
i could just sit and smell this stuff.
i feel in love with this product from the get go.
i love it because it makes my eye look better
i figured it was a big jar
can really see a difference if i get lazy
everyone tells me that i look like a college student
not in a good way
tried this eye product and love it.
this really brightens it up
all the good ones are
this cream really does make me like more awake
i don't really have an issue with dark circles
feel this is the one i will stick with
i really recommend that one
feel of it : it is not greasy
it felt like it was tighter around my eyes.
i am really enjoying the soothing effects it has each time i apply in the am
i love the feeling of it on my face too.
yes, it sounds pretty pricey.
i love how this feels
nothing i had ever used before made my skin feel so good
this product makes me want to use it all the time
my makeup has never looked so good!!
it kept my makeup looking nice
it also make my skin feel
'm definitely working on keeping wrinkles in check
i always believed the whole of there's something expensive there's always something just as good that's less expensive
this stuff is the real deal
it's quite a bit of product
i've always had combination skin
really gets the job done
makes my skin feel so soft that i have a hard time not touching it all day
this one really soaks in
my skin really looks younger
i love looking in the mirror.
i would definitely recommend getting it!
i think that there is still quite a bit of creme inside
feel like this will last me a really long time
i am really excited to see what else it can do after a full container's worth
i wouldn't really recommend this one since it can feel a bit "greasy" at times
what amazes me most is how perfectly it takes care of my dry winter skin when up until now
she decided to let me use a little bit of it
i think this is great for anyone who has o
i know my skin
this stuff is really amazing it makes your skin look more even
it's amazing how good my skin feels with this stuff on
it is the only thing that is working
it sure is making my skin look great
time on trying to make your face look like it is glowing
it is definitely a must have.
it smells and feels so good against my skin.
my skin did actually feel better
pretty sure this would be good
i just use whole set amorep' it really works if you can afford
the best way for me to describe this product is that it makes your skin feel comfortable
i can tell a difference w how my makeup looks now

makes the face feel so smooth
this product has really helped with my skin complexion
finally found something really work.

i started getting compliments on my skin when before i always had trouble with it
this stuff makes my face so smooth
mind you my pores are not huge
everyone keeps asking me what i have had done
this really works to me
---i am really not sure it reduces pores.
not a good thing for someone with problem skin
i can really see a difference
it has worked really well for me
never thought about it but it's a great thing.
my face definitely looks healthier
i definitely see a difference with my pores
it really worked on my skin.

truly worked for me
i think i have pretty big pores
i only really have been using it on my cheeks
i really like this product
it is always shiney
i think my results have been amazing
i am always sceptical of products
it's really good for making the pores on my face smaller
i am seeing good progress on the area around my mouth

it never happened to me when i was a kid
it has done wonders with my skin

i like the way my skin looks and how it feels.
i love this serum so much that it actually makes me sad to read negative reviews of this product
it's amazing how just adding this before my face lotion in the morning

the reviews of this new clinique product sounded too good to be true
do i now have flawless poceline skin?
this actually keeps them very clean
i honestly really liked this moisturizer because it definitely helps with healing both the fine lines in repairing collagen
she's been using this stuff for about a month now

i just had to try it for myself
i think that is pretty good
i already feel like a difference is being made
when i feel like some bump is starting to come out
i actually think it smells fresh
i could really see a difference in my skin--even under my moisturizer
i really enjoyed trying this trial size.
like the way it goes on
will keep using it to see if things really improve
this thing really works my face glows my skin lift

like the way my skin feels after i apply.
tired of not getting what you want out products try this
i really like how this product makes my skin look
i definitely see improvement in the fine lines around my eyes
so maybe they're working together
this is the only one that really
i like it for my decolotte
this stuff seems to work
well, i can honestly say my face is firmer.
thought it was my imagination
for a product that really works
i love love the way this stuff smells!
from what i can tell my skin is brighter
i didnt see nearly the results this stuff is giving me
it really does seem to be working
it goes on really lightly
i wanted to know what worked the best as skin was now dryer
who lets me spend this kind of money on my face
he said your face looks better everyday
i agree i dont think my face has ever looked so good
will definitely keep using
it's just so gratifying to find something that does make a visable change for the better
see my skin for yourself
i don't think i am looking my age at all
this stuff feels quite nice.
i think it certainly helps in keeping my skin looking good
"you look younger-are you doing something different?"
makes me feel less aged
this product is amazing i could see half of my wrinkles gone
am constantly told that i look younger
not really sure about sun damage
people always compliment me on how nice my complexion is
it really does what it says
i realize how very important it is to take care of my skin
i get a lot of compliments
with people thinking its my makeup
i really can stop using this cream
never really heard of the br

the bumps i was getting bothered me
family have been raving about how much my skin glows
this stuff really works!
this really does hve an impact
am always trying everything under the sun

saw results right away about the 3 day of use it's amazing my skin felt so smooth
i feel like my skin looks brighter
i love that because i feel my skin needs this at the end of the day
really loved how this made my skin feel
it makes my skin feel great the moment i put it on
does not feel greasy at all
spending a lot of money on something that just was not working
my skin has never looked or felt like this before
i've never loved my skin like this before.
i loved the sample but it just seemed so pricey.
really good stuff and well worth the money!
it goes on and feels so good.
smells pretty good too.
i can just feel the difference
i really like it
this cream definitely made a difference from day one
i especially love how it makes my skin look
i really like this cream
i love the way it makes my skin feel
i really like the algenist line
have had issues finding something that really works well for me
i feel when you spend $250 they shd attempt to make you happy
family told me that my skin hasnt looked this good in forever
this product has done wonders for me.
when i put this stuff on
i like this moisturizer quite a lot.
love how smooth it makes my skin feel
just realized that my skin does look different
with something so good
it seems to be doing everything as advertised.
i really love the texture of this product
i love the way this cream makes my skin feel
at the end of your day you make up still looks amazing
last of all eye makeup looks good too.
i did think that it made my face look greasy after application
it made my skin look really nice
people tell me my skin looks great
feel that it makes a differences in the texture
it works for me.
i feel this has helped with fine lines
i really really like that cream!
i think it is a very good value
i really like it--feels good on the skin.
i don't have horribly dry skin so maybe it wouldn't be so good for somebody who did
this moisturizer really makes a difference
it feels light going on
i love the smell of it too.
i really love how it feels
i might buy it once in a while anyway because it's pretty awesome
this stuff makes my skin look flawless.
i will keep using this though, i love the feel.
loved the way it made my skin feel
i can say my skin hasn't looked this great in quite awhile
i love the way it goes on
how it makes my skin feel
i just started wearing this so don't really know if it's going to be better than other moisturizers i've used
i like the way it feels
my face looks so good, and i will reorder.
my boyfriend asked me if i was getting a lot more sleep at night because i looked so alert
love this product feels so light
will definitely recommend anyone who wants an eye that work
my skin has not looked this good in years.
i love the difference they have made in my skin
i've found what works for me
i am thinking about getting the eye cream as well
i will definitely save
i love applying this stuff.
that was the case here too
found that it would always cake up
it's a really high quality product, you can tell.
and i always looked tired no matter what!
honestly i felt like i should have had a creamy lotion like eye cream because that's what i had been getting from all the other br
i got that cream feel
definitely feel a difference if i don't use it.
dark under eyes i always have
i never really noticed much of a difference
wow did it change the skin around my eye area
i am pretty sure i'll be buying it even though i have a full origins gingzing
i feel like my eyes look brighter
it makes my face feel great
the consistency is just right
this creme really works it make my eyes look so revitalized
i really love algenist products.
i really do see a difference in my dark circles
it's worked very well
i am very surprise that algenist renewal eye cream gives me a hope
while i don't have under wrinkles or really dark circles i feel like this is such a good product
it feels so nice under my eyes
i do feel like they don't get puffy in the morning when i wake up any more
i really love how this feels
i can definitely tell a difference when using this
hopefully i still feel the same way
i honestly always put this on when i go into a sephora location
it feels really rich
because of my terrible allergies i've always rubbed my eyes
i think this feels amazing on the eyes.
my laugh lines are pretty much gone
it really brightened my dark circles too.
this stuff is so amazing on any skin at any age
mind you neither of us have dark under eyes or really puffy eyes
am not sure how well it works with those concerns
they are both really really good
i would definitely purchase !
couple with this i've got pretty bad dark circles
i wonder if the cream goes bad after a while because the smell now is a bit off putting
it works really well with my eye makeup
something that happens after a bit of use with all products
i love the way it feels.
i honestly don't think it helped very much
if you really want to see a difference
made sure i used a very little product.
i look like i did quite a bit ago.
i always use primer beforeh
that always seemed like it would somehow end up getting in my eye
this stuff does work-instantly.
this stuff is insane!
it's something she really hates about herself
really wanted it to work
funny thing when you actually read the directions
i feel like my fine lines have really diminished
i feel like i look younger
very bad under eye bags
thank you so much!!!!!!!!!!!!
this stuff is what dreams are made of.
this was hard to get used to but i love it now.
it made me look like i had a good nights sleep.
yes, it works and it works well.
feel like it really tightens the under eye area
this one really works
if you use it very
it bothers me for years
it is definitely tricky figuring out the best way to use it
i feel like it makes me look younger.
everybody noticed the change
it hasn't been a big issue for me
makes me feel and look younger, for certain.
when you put it on you can feel the tightening of your skin
she wanted something to help her look really nice when she was going to a special event so she had me pick this up for her
she is quite please with it!
my mom has always taken really good care of her skin
you can feel it tighten
if you really want to reduce bags under your eyes
it's a very nice pick me up for those early mornings when i need a little help looking more awake
i knew this product would always be in my make-up regimen
new to me....makes my skin look "tight"
this stuff really works.
really works if you have big bags like me
a very nice male sales consultant told me about this product
i really like that this product actually works
useful that can be a dream come true for everybody
this stuff really works.
so bad that my mother said as a baby she noticed then how large my pores were lol
i've never seen my face or makeup look this amazing
you definitely hit it out the ball park on this one clinique
i really like this product
all the big ones with all the hype.
the pores on my nose have always been an issue
it also did a very good job of hiding my pores — paired with the foundation i use
this stuff is basically like a miracle
i like that it glides on really smooth
nothing else has ever worked as good as this product
plus i just hate the feeling of wearing makeup
no matter what i used it would feel itchy
it makes your skin look really good with zero effort
it really gives a nice cover across your whole face or just along the areas were your pores are most visible
makes me look even
where have you been my whole life!
this is probably my 5th tube of this magic stuff.
it makes my face feel so smooth
this promer does work reallly well
i really like this product.
i really love the feel
love this product, it works just like a primer.
it does a good job of making an even canvas before my foundation
you do not need a lot-a little goes a nice ways
feel clinique does a good job
together these work great at controlling my shiny t-zone all day
not a greasy shine just how it reflects the light i dont really like
i don't think it works as well as my primer
i always make sure i have this
it does even things out nicely
i almost feel wrong putting makeup on
since my skin feels so nice
i like the way this goes on
i really love this
i really like this product.
it hides them pretty well
i know it says you can put it on top of make-up too
definitely see a different in pore size
if you find that you need a little touch-up
it works quite well and i do like it.
i love how smooth it goes on
with no greasy after feel
i really like it.
it also makes my skin feel so smooth.
i hated the way my skin looked there
it sort of gives me some color
while this habit keeps my skin pretty clear
so my skin is always shiny, and i have school.
it really helped to minimize my pores too.
i really like this product.
it does apply nicely and is very light feeling.
i love how this is easy to use
i get so many compliments on my skin
it comes off really easily
definitely would recommend this to anyone!
i like it quite a bit
have not found one i've liked so well
i feel like my face is so smooth
i feel like it really gets in deep
so some will love it
the combo of the two gets the job done
i think the fragrance is what gives me a funny taste when the product gets in my mouth
t needs a lot of water to work perfectly
it works really well
you definitely don't want to get it in your mouth as it does taste horrible
either way, not so good.
only thing that i feel like really takes off all my makeup
(yes i said oily) trust me and take it home!
instantly my skin looked better
this stuff is the bomb
it gets the job done while leaving your skin feeling like a baby's
just for that i would buy this stuff the rest of my life
i don't feel like i got any skin improvements from it personally
it truly does help my skin
which is the whole point
this stuff is magic.
it works really well for eye makeup
if you wear a good amount of makeup this doesn't do a great job of fully removing it
this really does wonders
makes my skin feel so good
it does a pretty good job of getting all of my eye makeup off
i really love this cleanser!
i also love giving myself a nice face massage while working this onto my face
it works really well taking off all of my eye makeup including the they're real mascara by benefit
it can feel as if it i am tugging
for everyone else this should be a lovely cleanser
which gives you a lot of product
massage it in really good
never thought that maybe i should use a different cleanser until sephora beauty consultant educated me on the josie maran products
this stuff has made such a difference
thickness makes me feel like i'm wasting a lot of it
it smells so good i want to eat it!
i love the way my face feels after i use it.
my face loves this stuff.
my face loves this stuff
the whole oil cleanser thing always baffled
i am someone who has always liked to have a squeaky clean face especially after removing make up however i am someone with very dry skin
i love the way my face feels when cleansing
my skin loves me for it
i think its because of this stuff
i really like this product.
at age 55 my skin was looking not so great.
i swear my fave has never felt more clean
just like that all that makeup is gone
my skin never felt better!!
so this product is definitely great to use as your step 1 in your double cleanse
thought it was very nice
i break out really easily so finding a moisturizer that doesn't break me out is a big deal
when i do it works well with it too so all around great moisturizer
this is definitely my go-to moisturizer
this really helped clear up my complaction.
i also got tired of how heavy/greasy this product feels on my skin
oh my gosh this stuff is amazing!!
i really do love it.
it helped my skin a lot!
definitely try this out
my face just drinks this stuff in.
but this stuff is the business.
not greasy at all which i really love for my combination skin
my skin honestly does feel better after using it
i only gave 4 stars because i think it's pretty thick
after a bunch of treatment to get rid of acne about a year ago my skin has never really been quite the same
this moisturizer was just what i have been looking to find
i always feel cheated
the spf 15 is just right for me.
pretty good moisturizer although i would suggest only using in the morning or as a pick-me-up
i definitely wouldn't use at night
i love this stuff i was not sure how my skin would react to it
the first thing i noticed about this lotion was how incredibly it smelled
i recommended it to my mom, and she loves it too.
love them as well
personally i like it a lot
i feel like it gives great moisture without going overboard
there really isn't anything particularly special about this though
this made my skin really smooth
it feels so good going on
the packaging is really pretty.
i can really feel it working

it makes me look younger
the dark circles are definitely dimishing
i find it's very nice to use during the day
to be honest it kind of tingled

it works really well
so this really does the job
in the sense that there are a lot of
yes the packaging is not ideal as it can be hard to get out at times
when you get down to the less than 1/4 left of the product it's really hard to get out

it really does the job.

my skin has never loved me so much since this came into my life
she was so right!
that said, i love this line!
i love how my skin looks and feels.
t's always hard to find something that will moisturize
this was definitely it
if you've used proactiv you know how hard it is to get your skin off of that stuff
nothing does my skin good like this cleanser
as everything from perricone is
i do admit it looks quite nice sitting on your bathroom counter
obviously you are going to keep this in a place that is probably slippery
this gives me no trouble at all
not sure it really helps with aging.
everything makes me break out
love the whole line
the smell is okay
otherwise it is good stuff
just makes it feel really clean
i feel it is a

definitely have fine lines
it truly worked for me.
my eyes do not look so dull.
i really like this product.
i gave this product four stars because i feel like it isn't that strong by itself

someone asked me today how i was enjoying my twenties because i looked young

that is a big deal for someone who likes to try new stuff in search of what's better
this one is it for me
this product really does the trick
it honestly feels like face butter.
i knew i would like this because i love the eye cream
thought about trying out the moisturizer
is definitely one of them
i definitely feel my skin getting firmer.
i am so glad my search for the right moisturizer is over
it is not ideal to wear under makeup as it felt a bit greasy
let me start by saying i have young skin
this cream puts all others i have tried to shame
it feels like a dream when you put it on
that good when you look at the price tag
it never makes me feel greasy
it has done wonders for my skin
but you really pay for what you get.
i guess my skin was just catching up
works well, i see a difference in my skin
this product definitely does what it claims to do
come to sephora ask for a sample of it so you can feel it yourself
my skin is crazy.
i am sooo happy that i finally found a product that removes spots especially age spots from my face
the price kind of scared me
i could tell my whole skin tone was even
this bottle is definitely going to let me for months
my spots are definitely fading
i kid you not people thought i had a office treatment
i really liked this product because i felt it helped fade my acne scars
this product really surprised me by clearing my skin up
massage it in really well
i hope this helps someone
it really does work
this product worked really well for me!
i would definitely recommend it!
that is good enough for me :
i really like it
am definitely seeing a lightening
you do get a lot for your money

really seems to be making a difference
i also noticed this doesn't feel like it's just sitting on top of my skin like another similar product i tried
i would definitely recommend the product.
i really like it
i like the consistency
this is one of those products that makes you pause because it is obviously an upmarket br
along with some of their other products my skin has honestly never looked so great
the smell is alright
i really like this product.
i've never had skin that feels smooth
it does not feel tight at all
always want to use it
really easy to use and will take off eye makeup.
only cleanser i would ever consider spending $100 on--it's really that great
could already feel it working
it has done wonders for my face
i feel like people aren't using this product properly
or greasy how some people have said
my skin does not feel greasy after because i make sure to remove it properly
anyways though, it works well and i like it!
the first thing that i noticed is the smell because is not pleasant at all
i could feel some soothing feeling
it has really changed my skin
it is really quick
at first it feels a bit greasy
i recommend this to everybody
i think it smells kinda "healthy" if that makes sense
i think that's what amazes me the most
it really does leave my face glowing like the description says
why it is expensive because it really is a great balm
i could feel it in my pores
we love the smell
never feels harsh at all.
it works well and never irritates my skin.
not one has made my skin feel this good.
yet this product felt amazing on my skin
i always had combination skin
this stuff has helped with both
it works really well
you definitely feel the hydration act on your skin
this stuff is a miracle
yeah, it is very very nice!!!
it does feel a little greasy at first
after i felt my skin i wanted more
the eve lom is also lovely when you need your skin to feel extra clean
did a great job of removing makeup too.
you're doing it wrong if you feel greasy afterwards
i'll have to really think about it long
if you do it right you don't feel greasy afterwards
saw that many felt it was super greasy
i am definitely considering asking for this as a gift for christmas
makes the skin feel so good
i definitely recommend this product.
this cleanser makes my skin near to perfect skin if you're considering trying this please do it will change your life i'm so glad i picked up this cleanser i recommend it to everyone

i feel good about the ingredients i am putting on my body
i feel like it would work for all skin types.

was scared to do so as everything breaks me out
yes, ladies....it is that good.
this is pretty close
which is always a challenge
i would definitely recommend this product.
it makes my face feel nice
this stuff works wonders.
i especially like using it with my clairsonic.
i like to make sure everything if off my face at night
it makes the cleanser do the job it's supposed to do so here is what it has done to my skin: deep cleans

feels on my face
scared because my skin loves to break out
it has done wonders for my smile lines
i liked this cleanser a lot
that said it really did a lot to improve the overall quality of my skin
i just want to buy up the whole product line
i say it's the real deal because it really seems to have kept lines
i would be horrified if this lotion was ever discontinued because at this point i'm pretty sure it's the secret to my youthful appearance
it most definitely does that
the only thing it has a weird smell
love what this has done for my skin!
i gave it 5 stars even though it doesn't really work for me because the formula itself is great

this does not feel greasy
which feels like its doing something?
i really like this mask.
59 years old so finding something that makes my skin look good is important to me
i love the way my face feels after

but this definitely helps!
i really like this for spring/summer
once on it absorbs pretty quick.
when thinking of the overall big picture when it comes to my skin

definitely think my skin looks brighter
i guess with stress
i didn't realize how amazingly clear my skin has been looking
this is the real stuff
i always find myself going back to this night cream
realized how smooth it looked
my skin has never felt (or looked) better.
i am going to love it.
i really like this product.
they are fun to try
i did not feel like it was too heavy
the only thing that makes me cringe a little is the price tag
really noticed a difference in my skin
its really pricey so for all you vibs out there
you don't really need to use a lot of product for it work
that little jar made me an algenist fan for life.

i feel like you get a good amount of product for the price
however, i really enjoy this.
i feel like it does what it says

quite of distracting i guess
this stuff is wow!!

for $60 i am going to try other products before i think about buying this one for dehydrated skin
and your makeup goes on so good.
this stuff smells so refreshing
yet here i am to tell the world how wonderfully this product works
my face felt so smooth
this stuff is sooooo great.
it's great for someone who wants a pretty intense moisture punch
only when i feel my skin needs a little 'boost'
my face definitely needs a pick me up
i am sooooo glad that i did because i woke up with beautiful skin
a mask really nice you keep all the night long
i really love this.
this amazing night cream really started my love for skin care

nothing felt quite right
it goes on feeling super light
my skin felt "right"
just like it's supposed to feel
i will definitely keep using this
i find myself recommending it to everyone.
i should have listened to the sephora specialist when she told me this was too heavy in moisture for my combination skin
i feel like i'm really doing something good for my skin
this has already really helped smooth my skin
does have a pretty tacky feeling at first
t's pretty hard to find a product that moisturizers enough with out making me break out or have blemishes
i got it in my 500 point perk
i can see a big difference in my skin's texture
i felt really bad that this one from clinique is not in my favourites
i think i found "the one".
i can tell that my skin loves it
i feel that this one product has transformed my skin
i feel a difference for the entire day afterwards
i feel comfortable going out without makeup on
i really have noticed a difference in how my skin feels throughout the day
said to myself wow i look so clean clear

it seemed like a good enough moisturizer
i loved this stuff.
so much so that my dad said "wow your skin is looking way better" the next morning
if i feel that it would
very few things impress me overnight
i can definitely see a difference every morning
i would say the consistency is a good balance between a cream
the clinique rep told me it would deliver a more even skin tone
buy this stuff....now!!
all my girlfriends have mentioned that my skin looks amazing
has asked if i forgot to take my makeup off before going to bed because my skin looks so great
nothing has really ever worked miracles on it
this stuff is really nice
it last a really really long time
i feel a little bit greasy
also, you really only need a teeny amount.
thought it was just another moisturizer

it leaves me feeling kind of slick?
basically on the whole face

i do not find this scent to be too strong at all.
when i first started to use this product i wasn't sure if it was doing much for my oily combination skin
in the morning my skin looked really dull

i never really concerned myself with eye moisturizer or something to protect my eyes from aging
what makes me more happy about this product is that it smells great

i do think it is a good product
this eye cream is one of the first i've ever used that actually made me feel like it was making a difference

my skin is definitely brighter around my eyes since i started using this product
it does a great job of doing what what it claims
which i think was plantscriptions
has it done anything for my eyes?
liked it enough to keep it
it really calms me down
i guess cuz of this really cold weather
'm always worried about eye creams irritating my eyes
i think it's pretty good
i've even reached the point where i feel comfortable going out without foundation

this first of smells almost like you are in a salon it's very nice
what i like the most is that it really makes your skin feel clean
i definitely recommend giving it a try
this product is really good but its so tiny!
i like that part
this product does what it says it does make your face feel clean
'm always oily no matter what
really does reduce my oil
my face would never feel as clean as i wanted it
this works pretty well
it's definitely kept the oil level down.
i also really am not a fan of the smell
how it makes his skin feel
we definitely love the brand, too.
i really love this cleanser.

this is honestly my skin saver!
other than that, this is a pretty good mask.
made my skin feel
nothing really worked until i found this mask.
it smells really strongly of peaches which is great if you leave it on for 10 minutes
i feel like maybe my reviews on origins can be a little biased because they work sooo incredibably good on my skin
so obviously i went to sephora
after one time use i feel like my face smiles at me already
i can definitely feel the difference
my makeup definitely adheres better
i can see a big difference
it definitely helps it tone down
so good to use during the winter
i think it will be a great pick me up when my skin needs it
i loved the fact that there was loads of product in it
those ares not only feel great
it feels different just because i'm not used to feeling that part of my face moisturized
i knew my face would need some help with dryness
it does a very good job of what it aims to do.
this mask feels so good on the skin
i think everyone who has dry skin should definitely get one
however this is the only thing that has really helped
this mask does a very good job at helping those
i always forget about it
i will definitely keeping using this product
it just does something nice to the skin while it works
like other people said a thin layer is all you really need
my face does not feel greasy after i use it
it definitely works very well for that.
i definitely need that
this did just that -- after just a couple nights of using this my skin looked so soft
i even got compliments on my skin

i find it also cools down my skin which feels really nice
i can really feel a difference in my skin after using this product
my other skin care did great
that's why i always check for the ingredients
was having a tough time finding a moisturizer that doesn't cause breakout
you really don't have to use a lot to get good coverage
it really is a light
this product feels sooo good on my skin!
my skin has never felt happier.
all of them have given me weird reactions or made me dry
everyone it also helped my acne a lot
finding a balance has really helped.
it never makes me feel dry
i definitely don't see any shine after applying
don't really see a huge change
my mom got me this lotion because she'd heard good things about the br
it does also create a bit matte feeling
i still think it's a great product to get especially in the summer time
i get a lot of acne in a month
it does not ball up and feel gritty.
i feel that this along with my primer
not in a good way" look
i really like the smell!!
i love how little you need
i love the way it feels on my skin
either way i truly love the way this absorbs
makes my skin feel
it is really changing my skin.
really gets the job done for me
i think i have found the one
i found myself having to apply it twice just to make my face not feel dry
feels and smells good too.
feels and smells good too.
this stuff will help you be 'zitless'
this stuff works so well with checks
my skin never looked this good!
this moisturizer has proved to me that it is possible to take care of your skin if you have horrible
which in my opinion is definitely good for $4
you will obviously see the redness
i felt like it did help a lot
once i feel one developing
this mask definitely helps with my problem areas
i find that it never really dries
just the best face mask for when your skin is really in trouble
the beauty consultant at sephora told me this would work better for my skin
i truly believe it helped prevent breakouts for me
definitely recommend to those who have been struggling with their skin
i really liked this one
there is always something there
i think i will always keep some of this in stock.
it will do some good work
while at first i didn't 100% love it it's pretty good at reducing acne
definitely recommend this mask.
it feels so so so nice to put the mask on cold
this really does work.
sometimes daily if i'm really stressed
i always feel so fresh after washing it off
this is the only product that i can actually feel working
feel like it's working
this stuff is a miracle.
this mask really helps!
this mask is great if you don't have a lot of time on your h
it made my skin feel amazing
i can always tell when i've gone too long without using it because my skin starts to look bad
got this guy instead

because this product says it's better for oily skin it made me kind of nervous
thought it was nice
i would definitely recommend you get this
i really like how natural feeling
it really helped just ease it up
so this worked really well for me
not my whole face
but works really well!
kind of hard to wash off
it definitely works though
it loved how it made my skin feel
the smell is a littler weird at first
i definitely see improvements in my skin
i would definitely recommend it!

i loved how it felt
i also love how clean your face feels afterwords.
when i feel acne is coming on
definitely would recommend this to friends
this is definitely my new go to clay mask!!
i love the way this makes my skin feel.
i don't really like the smell, though.
this made my skin feel so good.
just make sure to follow it with a good moisturizer
thought the scent was quite interesting in a good weird way lol
the results are always good
it has helped my skin a lot
'm definitely going to buy the bigger one
it's really great for when you've been bad to your skin
it really helped my skin to improve
my skin is seriously glowing right now.
if you don't mind the smell i definitely recommend this product
if that makes sense.
so naturally i got here
my skin has been freaking out
this is saying a lot
it has definitely helped clear my skin
you'll feel better in the morning.
you can definitely feel it working
it always makes my skin feel super smooth
they did a good job
calmed it makes my skin just adds a whole other layer of obsession to how i feel about this product
i like the feeling of this mask on my skin
it's hard to pin point which one is working the best or if the combination of everything is the way to go
it's a great mask once you get over the weird feeling
makes your face feel very smooth
the feeling when you take it off is so refreshing
idk thought i think they are both equally really good
also the fact that i can feel it working
you can for sure feel it doing work on your face
i definitely notice a difference in my skin
i would definitely recommend it.
it felt really nice it was like a cooling gel feeling
the pump is really annoying
i will continue to use this because the product is so nice
my skin always feels so smooth
this stuff is so nice i got a sample of it in a set
it makes my skin so smooth i've noticed that when i don't use this my makeup down look as good
i feel like my skin looks new
i really like this product
the way it made my skin feel so smooth
i really liked this product
it makes my skin feel nice
the only thing that i don't really like too much about this is the smell
it has done wonders for my skin
i like how my skin feels
i don't feel i get all of the product out
i really do like this moisturizer
i feel that for the price
i love how it feels on my skin
always feel like there's product being left inside
gives a really fresh feeling
i've never worn moisturizer my whole life from bad experiences breaking out
several people have told me how beautiful
i really love this gel
it makes no sense
i still get little pimples here
it's the first moisturizer i feel comfortable putting all over my face
i can definitely tell my pores are getting smaller
the worry is real
stays that way the whole day
i feel like it has even helped reduce my acne.
how it's not awesome for getting every last bit of the product
it is certainly cooling
it would feel nice in the summertime.
i obviously love this
thankfully i still look really young for my age
i felt it was time for me to start doing more
it always feels so great-
i always wakeup with flawless looking skin
it has a nice tingling feeling when you put it on
i honestly love this gell on my face after a month going into two i love how my skin looks n feels i will recommend it to the whole world no lie i love boscia br
you will see a difference in the way your face feels when you use this moisturizer
this is the only moisturizer i have ever felt comfortable using under my makeup
this stuff is amazing -- my package cannot get here fast enough
hopefully someone reads this
this is the first thing that has made me stray because it is amazing
i love how it feels so cool when you apply this.
it really helps with the acne
i really like this moisturizer
i actually really like this product
i really like it
this does a good job keeping my face matte
i love the refresing feel of it
i really like this product
it makes my skin feel good
it's worked just fine for me.
definitely my new it product.
i find you have to use quite a bit of product each time to see results
i think it seems to be making a difference.
that's just because this is that good of a product
not just feel smooth
i would definitely try it out
this one is actually really good
i find this cream to be really good
not really to be honest
i can see a difference around my eyes
i really do like this eye cream.
i always find myself reaching for it
appreciate really no scent
after hearing great things about this eye treatment
this really helped with my under eye circles
it really does brighten.
people have told me i never look tired any more
now if only there was a way to not feel so tired
nothing really seemed to work
would definitely recommend it
i can really tell a difference.
i really love this product
it really just smoothed everything out.
i really enjoyed using this eye treatment.
it felt a little refreshing
i felt that it did improve my under-eye circles
so far i really like the way my eyes look
'm sticking with it
it does smooth things out a bit
you really don't need a lot at all
this comes pretty close
unfortunately i have that from rubbing my eyes a lot when i was young
i think it has helped
this is a nice eyecream it seems to be working okay
my eyes haven't looked this nice in years.
i really like this brand.
i really like this eyecream.
this stuff is cool
it makes my under eye area feel amazing
i am a pretty young looking mid-50's
i really think so.i wear eye make-up daily.
nothing can beat getting a good night's sleep
sometimes eye products really bother me
i feel like this is doing what it claims
well ladies these pads are not just for the guys.
feels like a baby's bottom
i always feel cleaner when i use these.
i really like these pads.
i do find that these make my skin very irritated
you get a lot of product for what you pay
those kind of reviews always slay me.
i really wanted a product that would help lessen the appearance of the scars
i definitely feel that this product helps the evenness of my skin
i would definitely recommend this!
i do really enjoy this product
a half in order to hit my whole face with what feels like enough product
it makes my face feel really nice when i wake up though
but every time they really do make it better.
definitely can see the difference.
the reason i do like the turnaround one is that it makes my skin feel soft in the morning when i wake up
think the combination of those two products make my skin feel good
it didn't make me break out which is always good
so during the day i just want something that will keep my skin balanced
this stuff has been like bootcamp for my face
something i've always thought was impossible
the turnaround system really got me in line.
i feel like this is the product i've always needed
it definitely helps a lot
that is saying a lot
i really do feel like it has improved my skins texture
definitely recommend this product.
i can say that the texture is great
everything has definitely reduced
what a difference this makes!
people think i am younger than i really am :
i definitely recommend this one ladies
it has definitely helped lighten
this one really brightens my skin
i decided to try this since it got such great reviews
i looked like that
the serum feels really nice when applying it
i really love this stuff.
my skin gets really dull looking during the winter
this helps a lot and doesnt feel slimy.
this feels smooth going on
i love the way this feels when i put it on
anyway, this stuff feels great.
it really makes a difference in the texture
when i'm using this my skin is always clear
this stuff has been like bootcamp for my face
something i've always thought was impossible
the turnaround system really got me in line.
i love how it feels on my skin
none of them really work for me
i really love this cream.
it can feel a bit "slick"
i love this so much i wanted to share the good news
i remember feeling that this might be too greasy
my first impression wasn't too great
that's how you know this product is working
not making me look greasy throughout the day
these two together are the very best things i've tried
this stuff takes the cake
in winter it's really bad
this stuff really calms it down
just want to share with you that this is my skin saver
this makes my skin feel very comfortable
am fairly normal everywhere else
how it makes my skin look
no matter how good it looks under my make up
i do really like this gel cream
my face starts to feel like a mask
this stuff changed all that.
before it dawned on me that a really intense moisturizer was what i needed to make my foundation smooth
make me feel really self conscious
it does leave a kind of greasy feel
i can say with confidence that this product is amazing
otherwise it's a very good product.
this is a really nice moisturizer for anyone over 70 as it makes your skin feel so soft
gave it a try as so hard to find something that is not greasy
if you use too much it can feel like it sits on your skin for a while
noticed none of my make up looked good.
it got really bad this past winter
really like how my skin feels after it.
i really like this product
still feel great the next morning
i woke up with my face still feeling great
if you touch it you can definitely feel it
so yeah it doesnt feel heavy.
my face has never felt more refreshing
it felt gel like at home
so far it really feels good on my skin not too greasy just the perfect amount of moisture
definitely recommend this product
i feel my skin can still breath
although i actually ended up returning this because it was really incompatible with my skin type i have to say for anybody that has moisture issues this product is absolutely fabulous
this stuff is seriously a lifesaver
now that i'm 50 something my skin
it's the only thing i've found that will work the whole day in the winter for me
i think this product is probably best for very dry skin
together they really do the trick
which obviously costs you a pretty penny
it makes my skin feel
love the way it feels
i wanted to lighten them
i really like this product
my skin has never looked so good in my life
you guys need to re-market this product
i feel like my skin really drinks it up
this stuff really works.
which made me look tired
this product is something truly new for me
this definitely is smoothing
i've always thought "you get more for your money with anti aging serums" this stuff is amazing
even my daughter in law commented how nice
i don't know if it removes or lessens wrinkles since i don't really have them--i have been taking good care of my skin all my life
it does feel nice
after the first couple of days my skin felt soooo much better
am not sure about how well this works
nice feel, skin appears to look better
i can really tell
but it really works!!
i definitely notice a difference
my eyes really poped and felt increadibly firm.
they absolutely look 100 times better even after getting out of the shower
definitely helped with dark circles
), and this really lifts and takes care of it.
i think it's actually working- which is kind of crazy
best part is that i feel it lasts all day!
it works for me
i love you use it all about the eye
my goddaughter even told me what a difference it makes with the crepyness on my lid
i really like this product a lot
got to see just how bad wrinkles are
the only thing is that i feel like i still need to put some other kind of eye cream after applying this
the crepiness was really bothering me
perricone's is working for me.
i wanted to be sure that the product worked
but this one really makes a difference.
for me, this one works!
it really has helped the crepiness on my eyelids
this is indeed helping my eyes
you can feel it on contact.
have always been told i look much younger
lately my eye makeup doesnt sit the way it always has
it really does open up the eye = making me look younger by 5-10 years
nobody told me i had to invest in a gentle way to remove it
it makes my eye skin feel tighter
very good product it really works, i love it
you definitely need to let it soak in
plus she told me she received compliments on how good she looked
no greasy after feel
my dark circles are obviously deminishing
i love how that it feels very light, a big plus!
i really enjoy using this product
i really like it
doesn't make me break out and feels nice.
i love the way it feels on my skin when i do this
i definitely found it with this product
i honestly don't know how my skin survived with just a moisturizer before i found this product
it just makes my skin feel so good
i really liked this product.
i find myself wanting to touch my face to see how soft it is
they've never been enough because i get very dry around my lips
i am so in love with this product.
it feels like it was made for my skin.
it looks so healthy that i don't really want to put foundation over it
i liked how smooth it made my face feel
this feels good going on under or over makeup.
my makeup lasts pretty well all day
i get compliments from everyone
this really does quench
i really like it
over the years i'm sure i drove some sephora skin care consultants crazy as i was not quite content with the results i was getting
feels like it is really cleaning deep down
it really works wonders
my skin definitely feels smoother
i really love this cleanser!
this stuff works wonders!
i think that stuff like this always works differently for other people
i definitely have some combination
i can really see a difference
i feel like my skin really gets clean with this
it's always a comforting feeling after a long day at work
boscia has always done right for my skin
it has been so hard to find a good cleanser to suit my needs
helps me create a better base for my makeup
is really hard to find a good cleanser
it really hasn't looked this great in years.
i really like this
he said it looked like i was wearing makeup that's how clear my skin looked
still powerful enough that i feel like my skin is clean at the end of the day
i will say that the smell is very different
the sales guy recommended it to me
just wish it really cleaned out my pores like i had hoped
it also feels really nice on the skin.
the first time that i tried it felt good after a few days i started noticing that my skin was getting better as i have usually get very bad acne on my chin area
i will say make sure to be careful it got everywhere makes whatever it gets on black
love this stuff , i always keep reordering it .
this makes my skin feel
would definitely recommend this product.
i feel like there is rarely an in-between product like this
you definitely get what you pay for
loves it too so now it's a must in our home
i really do notice my skin is better
i love the way the products feel on my skin
i feel like i don't even need a whole pump.
it's been a struggle to find something that can really clean my skin
this guy did the trick
this cleanser is really great if you want to break down your make up
it's amazing my skin is so much happier!
i would start getting crazy breakouts
now i feel like my skin can literally not live without this product
i really struggle with finding products that thoroughly clean my face
really helped clear up my skin.
t warms up when you use it which is not only fun
i liked the warming feeling
it's not fun to use
i love how clean it makes your skin feel
i've really seen a difference in my skin since i've started using it
i really recommend this product!
my husband uses it too and loves it!
i really like this stuff !
you can feel it getting warmer as you rub it around
this works for me
i think it is good because i actually feels like some kind of detoxifying is going on
he even said he liked it how it feels on your skin
we both loved it
kind of sounds too good to be true
it definitely worked on my skin
definitely suggest doing that first
it really messed up my skin
i started to get really bad breakouts for the first time in my life
my skin is definitely brighter
this oil has made my skin look and feel better.
which i liked a lot
i also feel like it does what it professes.
i really love algenist products.
you can really notice a difference in my skin within 2 weeks
especially if your 40 like me!
will definitely keep using it!
my skin does not feel tight.
i am so in love with it for my under eye area!
i can feel it working
literally after just one use i could feel that my face was tighter
over time my skin definitely feels firmer
really aged the look of my skin
they all last me quite a while
makes my skin feel really smooth
although i haven't noticed much difference yet i love how it makes my skin feel smooth
this product definitely works.
dark marks that really make me mad waiting for them to fade
my mom tells me to thank my greaseface for the lack of wrinkles
just makes no sense
really dealing with acne
this really delivers for me
i definitely see a lifting
this is a definitely maybe/probably because it is worth it to me
for $94 i feel it should do it all
always wanted to try this br
i am so in love with this product.
i could never find one that genuinely hydrated my skin
i feel as though it's already tightened my neck
i think it has done wonders for my skin
only plastic surgery is really going to lift your skin
okay for the cream they've got it right
i just love how this feels on my face
this product has definitely helped to lift my skin
it does work well for me
i really love it
i don't think i need a lot of firming
because i have some very fine
trust me i know heavy
definitely recommend this for someone with dry/combo skin like me
i really liked this cream because it smells like absolutely nothing
i will preface this saying i have pretty good skin for my age already
here is the not so good news: my commas only look about 15% better
so am i keeping this?
just want to find something rich
love how it keeps my skin tone even
love the way it makes my skin look
i can see an amazing difference around my jaw line
this has made one heck of a difference.
it was really out of my price range
i love how my skin feels
however, my husband's skin loved it.
every time i use this product my skin looks
i always look forward to using it
this really lives up to its name.
while i liked it a lot i didn't notice any huge changes in my skin
he really likes them both
i really do love this stuff
without making me feel greasy at the end of the day
i feel like i look younger
i've pretty much tried everything.
you can feel and see it working.
tightens skin and makes me feel great.
you definitely notice a difference
i love the way it makes my skin feel.
my neck is the only thing i really hate
i don't really think it has changed my skin
i am actually going to recommend it to my mom for her eyes
algenist is doing the job right for my eyes.
i can tell you this or this combo has done amazing things
have really liked it
it definitely helps to lift them.
so she knows what she's talking about
tells me it's doing something other than sitting on top of my skin
my eyes are obviously lifted i have always had heavy lids
i really like this stuff.
it helps my eye area look younger
this is not sooooo bad
i experience a lot of depuffing with this product
i really like this product.
seems to see some difference
i feel better about myself
i wasn't looking young that day
i am on my second bottle which is really saying something
his words were, "whoa, you look so refreshed.
have you been getting good sleep lately?
it just works for me
you definitely need an eye cream
this stuff works really well!
i don't see a real difference in my eye area
have noticed a definite---really positive---difference in my eyes: not only are the fine lines that i have pretty much gone
i can feel and see the difference!
can use on eyelids too which is really great.
if i need to perk myself up
if that makes sense
this product is still working well for me.
my skin has not looked so good in years!
it has definitely changed my skin
it feels great when you put it on
it also woke up feeling really greasy which wasn't my favorite
i think most people would really love this product it just wasn't for me
it smells so so good
when i wake up i get so excited knowing that i'm gonna use this product
it feels so great at night time you really feel like it's working throughout the night
i would definitely recommend.
i feel like it has a good matifying effect as soon as it sinks into the skin
my skin feels very fresh after i put it on.
definitely helped my pores
now that i've found this stuff
using another moisturizer was not a good idea
i put a nice amount of this moisturizer on my face every morning
who knew that a moisturizer like korres will work for a my face
i don't really need to use my foundation at all
putting it on each morning is so fun just because of how it smells
the lady who helped me out was so helpful
i love the way my face feels!
moisturizers have always been off limits although i know they are good for skin
with a nice finish -not greasy or heavy feeling at all
while i do love the consistency
i don't think it gives me a matte finish like i was hoping/expecting
it did feel lovely on my skin
maybe give it a shot because it's a great moisturizer in all other regards
this seemed like a good product to try out
i definitely recommend this product!
i feel like i'm treating myself every time i put this on
hope it makes a difference
this one really seems to help
i really like this.
i am not sure about the "matte finish" here as after a couple of hours my face gets a bit oily
it really does amazing things to my skin
maybe notice a real difference
i cant imagine how great my skin will look after
like everyone else it helped reduce my dark spots post breakout
hope it's just as good.
this balm works really well
wow what a difference it made!
nothing makes my face feel so smooth
i really love it.
it works wonders for my skin
this is definitely a splurge
this stuff has helped
i really love it
instantly made me think that it would make a great primer
i am still using it because it really makes the wrinkles appear to go away
i am sure it works as well.
it definitely did not soak in
i really wanted to like this product.
i dont remember my skin being this nice
my skin looked so nice.
the fragrance in this really bothers me though
so you will really get your use out of the jar
after just one use of this product i could definitely see great results
works really well for all skin types.
've never been a night cream kind of person because of this
it's very light, but i love it.
this has honestly been a lifesaver
i really love the results
i liked the way this made my skin feel.
it definitely wasn't bad at all
definitely love and would recommend to anyone.
known me my whole life
it does feel great on my skin at night
my skin has never been so glowy
in doing so makes my skin look younger
there is one negative: the smell is so strong that even my boyfriend complains about it
makes me feel really relaxed
this product is amazing because it works while i sleep
gives me just the right amount of hydration.
the brightening is really really works.
this is definitely a staple in my skin care routine
actually really love it
love how my skin looks
love the way it goes on
although i love the way this night cream makes my skin feel
i just love the way it feels going on my skin
it feels like it absorbs pretty well
doesnt feel like i have something on my face
it feels nice going on
i still love it
it goes on really easily
i actually really like the smell
i like how it feels on my skin
i will say this stuff is amazing
there really is something with roses
i really like this product
i feel like smooth
i really enjoyed what this does to the skin as it makes it plump
love from my very first try
i've always had problems with my skin
this one turned out to be a really good one
i always get compliments on my skin
i love the way it made my skin feel
i do love the way it smells
it really does brighten you skin
!it smells amazing, and it relaxes me so much.
really liked this product
this is one of those masks where i can genuinely see a difference when i wake up
would definitely recommend it to anyone
i love everything about this
i would definitely recommend this.
your skin looks really good
my skin just feels so good when i wake up
it makes my face feel great
which i feel leaves behind a lot of product
you can really feel it breaking down all your makeup
a bit pricey, but really nice.
after this process my skin just looks
(but i still did) this is just really good.
i got one for my mom too
this one uses the real thing
sometimes it really stings my eyes- i'm totally willing to put up with that though because i love this cleanser so much
you use so very little of this product for great results
really like how it makes my skin feel.
great if you want washing your face to feel like more of a spa experience
it did make my whole face very soft
i can see myself getting addicted to this.
this makes me feel like i'm at the spa when i take off my make up
this stuff is so great for me
this feels like the dirt
my face was always left feeling thight
this stuff is not pleasant if it gets in the eyes
you don’t mind not using it on your eye area then it could save you a lot of money since i felt i didn’t need a moisturized afterwards
my face feels so clean when i'm done!
this gives me just the right amount hydration
this balm is so perfect that i have to write something
the sense is ok
this works really well with my clarisonic!
i really like it
i personally couldn't use it for that purpose because it burns my eye area very badly
smells very nice too.
not good around the eyes
especially if you had a really made up day
i kid you not.
my skin does not feel tight
i find that my skin feels
when it's that good who cares
t really seems to work for everyone
this stuff is the bomb!
they could definitely improve on the cloth.
the way my skin feels
it really gets everything off
s does wonders to keep them looking young
respect very well how it is supposed to be applied if you want result
you really need to make sure it is completely removed or it will sting your eyes
it's also really important to use a cloth with this to remove the product completely from around the eyes
i feel like i treated myself to a well deserved mini facial
while the product has a lot of good things going for it
i really love this product!
it's nice after working a long day at work to come home to this product
i love how my skin feels afterwards
i really loved this it even takes off my waterproof makeup just fine
this works pretty well for me
i felt it did a good job removing my makeup.
a lot of them will cause my skin to get really flushed
smells so strongly of perfume that i hate putting it on my face
i feel like it's just too over powering to put directly on your face
think i will get a lot of use from one jar
she and i have very different skin.
everything makes me breakout
i like how it makes my skin feels
it really cleans super well.
it comes with a cloth that i'm not sure i like
so nice and so natural, can't help but love it.
leaves skin feeling so good
have always had great things to say
this cleanser feels a bit odd the first time you use it
this stuff is seriously amazing.
they really bothered me
i love the way it goes on
its a good to for me, when going out.
i still love this product
am constantly surprised when people tell me out-of-the-blue what beautiful skin i have
it honestly for me happens right before my eyes
am always looking to make it better
you really only need a little
it always delivers a notice difference
she liked it a lot
felt like a perk to the skin
my skin was pretty good
i can definitely say that i am noticing a difference with this product
concerns it is hard to have that one product that "does it" for everyone
i don't think i've ever seen my skin look this nice in quite some time
mostly because i don't feel like this is a "must have" product
definately looks more even in tone
it makes you look
i heard great things about this one
can definitely see the difference
that gives me that "glowy" look i've always heard others talking about
this stuff really works.
love the way this product makes my skin feel
i definitely feel a difference in my skin
maybe i just got a lucky bottle
i can definitely say my skin looks better
i can say that it feels really nice when i put it on
so are really good to fight off wrinkles
i feel like it's prevented more wrinkles from happening
while some say they " aren't bad wrinkles" we're always hard in ourselves
it has worked really well.
i love what it has done
i consider myself a face cream "afficionated".
ptr has always surprise me with real results
not a pretty smell, which is just fine with me.
i really like this cream.
ok, so it smells bad.
not always since i don't always wash it
that's also not a big deal to me because i'm just using this at night
really wanted to love this moisturizer since it makes my skin glowy
my 40-ish skin looked and felt nice.
it still bothers me
i find a good moisturizer that does what i need difficult to come by
my skin feels so great since i use it
i think it's great to put on before applying make up
yes the smell is pretty bad
i saw a lot of bad comments about the smell
i've noticed how great my makeup has been going on
my face always feels smooth
i am not sure how much i feel it has helped wrinkles
i do love the way my skin feels
instantly i felt a difference
it gives my skin the dewy look i've never been able to find in a foundation
i can definitely see that my skin is looking smoother
definitely liked the light feeling
i love how this stuff makes my face feel!
this has really helped
trying to get my skin as good as it can look
it is certainly enough that it gives a little tingle when i put it on
i love the way it makes my skin feel.
this product is the only thing that has helped me
it is really soothing
the sephora consultant did tell me that it is an amazing moisturizer
it is really doing the trick
thank you for a creme that really works.
been using for quite awhile
the smell is definitely something to get used to
what the difference in my skin is
this stuff is quite good.
a little goes a long way because it really does tingle
i hope she loves it as much as i do.
i try not to get it around my eyes or any place super sensitive because it really is that potent
it feels great everywhere else
it truly helps me relax
always feel the need to wash my clothes immediately afterward
this is great because no one around me can really smell it
just a nice product to have around even if you don't use everyday
i must say that this is a great alternative to taking medications everytime i get a headache
does seem to help me relax when i feel a tension headache coming on
it definitely gives your skin a tingle
i really like this product.
would definitely recommend to those who need help relaxing
this definitely helps me relax
goes with me everywhere now!
it really helped me to center
just an amazing little thing you can carry around with you to rub on your temples or neck when stressed
it smells so good and is relief immediately.
it really does help to destress
smells really refreshing too.
it works for me
lotion for a nice little pick me up
i've always had a problem with keeping my foundation in place
i don't think this would be great if you have dry skin
this product works really well.
my makeup stayed looking very good
when she applied this product on my skin it felt nice
i really like this product.
living in los angeles has really made my skin incredibly oily so this serum has definitely helped control that problem
the umbrian clay treatment was so good at helping clear up break outs that i thought i try this to prevent them all together
it has really helped clear up my skin
it really controls your oil
it has worked really well on my oily
this regimen is really helping with this
it has really helped with controlling my shine.
i love the way it makes my makeup feel "set"
they work so well together!
i would definitely recommend this product
this stuff really makes a great base
everything you need in it.
my skin has literally never looked better
you get a lot of product for the money
you don't have to use a lot to get great moisture that lasts all day
this really helped clear all that up
its really helped with my acne
my skin has never looked or felt as good as it does when i use this
it feels really clean
this lotion works really well.
this really does what it claims!
after i started using this my skin felt so great i didn't even have to use that
this really fixed that too
it does not tremendously brighten my skin
it does help with brightening my acne scars which i really like it
it does not get 5 stars because i felt that it did not really moisturize my face very much
this product really helps
love how it feels
when you first put it on it feels cool
after a few minutes it give you a very cool feeling that is very awakening
i love using this in the morning when i am not totally awake
i put it on my hubs too & he loves it too!
makes you feel it is really working to give your eyes a more refreshed look
the beauty of it is that it seems to last a fairly good amount of time
this product actually works for me
this feels so good going on!
this is my go to product for my eyes
keeps me from looking as tired as i really am from my work schedule
enough to make people think you got your beauty sleep
i work nights so i'm tired a lot.
it feels really amazing under eyes.
the only thing i don't really like
really does feel cool on your eyes
it really helps on those mornings when i feel extra tired- it gives an instant
i just got this and i love it!!
know it was working
my gosh does it pack a cool punch
this stuff helps make me look
it really did work
it really does depuff which i tested on a particular day when i had been crying
i like the refreshing feel.
other ones i have tried with rollerball tips tend to make me feel like i'm actually bruising my eyes not helping them
this feels so refreshing to me!
it worked so well under those circumstances that i found myself sneaking it into my regular routine just because it feels good
you can feel it right after you put it on
it really helps with little bags
i do feel like i see some de-puffing
this product is so nice if i apply this when i have bags in the morning they will be completely gone within 15 minutes or less make up applies very well on top of this the texture is gorgeous
refreshing feeling if gives my tired eyes
i love the way this feels under my eyes.
i really like the feeling of this product
this balm definitely feels cool as soon as it goes on
i do feel like there is some depuffing
i just know it feels good
it instantly makes my eyes feel better
i put mine in there and it feels so soothing.
it really is a good pick me up.
it definitely gives cool feeling when i put on
that being said, i really love this product!
this product definitely revives your tired eyes.
i don't physically notice a difference in the way my eyes look
but making you look more awake, not really.
i love the cool feel of this product!
it seems to work great for everyone else though.
i think it smells really nice
i think the light fragrance must just be because the ingredients smell good
this stuff seems to do all it promises.
this is definitely cooling
i keep it with me all the time to give my eyes a little pick-up whenever i feel like it
i really like this product to make me feel awake
i will continue to use this product because i really like the way it feels
i really love this product!
it really does work
i owe a lot to clarins to be honest
something i should've done from the get go
this is it for me for life
my skin always looks taught
thank you guy at sephora
'm glad it's a scent that doesn't make me nauseous since i'm pretty sensitive about that
my face definitely feels smooth
i love how my skin looks and feels.
it definitely makes me look more rested
unfortunately everything still breaks me out
that says it all.
i've always been a fan of clarin's products
this oil really does everything it says it does.
if you are young
i've noticed my skin isn't looking as good as it once was
and i love the way my skin is looking.
like it is for me.
i felt it was way too strong
this moisturizer feels so nice when i put it on.
i know it sounds weird
i can definitely tell a difference in my 49-year old skin
is not so good for the skin's health
i really see the difference after using this
i think the scent is particularly nice.
actually this is so freaking good
i am not one who is frequently impressed by "basic" skincare so to say this blew my mind is saying a lot
they do something really unusual for my skin
night after night i cannot believe how good this makes my skin look
i can definitely tell a difference in my 49-year old skin
i can definitely tell a difference in my 49-year old skin
my skin haven't feel so smooth
i can definitely tell a difference in my 49-year old skin
it does not cause uncomfortable feeling at all
this is definitely my "go-to" mask.
in the morning i can feel
you don't expect to always see amazing results
this is a splurge for sure
everything i've tried has made me break out terribly
i can definitely tell a difference in my 49-year old skin
all the ingredients are so nice i was looking at a video from omorovicza
always look forward to using it
it works for me
i know the price tag is really out there
be careful around the eyes because it always seems to get into my eyes no matter how hard i try to avoid it
after using my skin feel really clean
skin does not feel tight at all.
i can definitely tell a difference in my 49-year old skin
i am happy with this since it doesn't break me out- idk why it is soooo hard to find an oil free moisturizer with sun screen
in fact i always apply 2-3 layers under makeup so my makeup looks nice
i really do like this moisturizer
it sinks in really well i love clinique overall
my skin looks so good now
this stuff is so awesome i'm so happy i found something that targets both protection against the sun
i really love this lotion.
i really feel like it is evening out my skin
to the point where i'd feel comfortable going outside the house with only powder if i was just running out for something quick
think i have a pretty good grasp of how it's working
otherwise, really nice product.
definitely want the spf protection
this product really does live up to its advertitsing
i will recommend this to everybody
i definitely have combination skin
they work well for me.
you will definitely see a change in the appearance of your skin
when i was getting my makeup done recently the sephora rep kept raving about how well moisturized my skin was
i never thought face oils would work on my skin type
've been struggling to find a really good hydrating face oil
this stuff changed my life.
it was really aging my skin
i decided to majorly step up my skin care game
my face loves this stuff.
this has done all of those things for me
i can already feel
that's pretty spot on
why do i feel like i could have found this in my kitchen?
i don't see a big difference in my skin
it leaves my face feeling so nice
seriously, my skin is amazing right now.
i feel it would be off-putting to some
i never felt like i was getting enough hydration when i used it
i think juno does it all so well
i also think juno improved my skin quality in just a week
other than the not so plesant smell its pretty good
i would break out pretty bad
just when i thought i knew all about marula
i definitely recommend this product
always break out with just anything
always heard great things
but this stuff here is even better to me.
i feel good putting great ingredients on my skin that i know work
this oil definitely not making my skin dry which is a good sign
this has done just that
i really like this juno oil.
no problem w/the smell like others have commented
has done wonders for my face
i actually prefer this over good genes.
a weird ph that will cause pretty much every foundation to break up on my skin
i would definitely recommend this product.
it actually made my skin look and feel unreal.
my skin has never looked as great as it does now
which is always a plus
definitely up to you to determine if it deserves the price tag
right off the bat, the smell is not great.
i even love the smell- like a really good food grade oil
so hopefully this helps someone out there love what i think is otherwise an amazing oil
nothing else seemed to be working for my acne
i can definitely see a difference now
^__^ your skin will go with you your whole life.
it's best to nourish it now so you can look good later
juno has not irritated me one bit
i feel like it's actually balanced out my crazy combination skin
i actually really like it
so the smell is actually comforting to me
i really like this oil.
i feel like if i spend a lot on a face oil
this stuff really surprised me.
when you use it you can feel the luxury behind the br
i personally will not put a price tag on look-in good
this has really helped to rectify that
have noticed a big difference in my skin when i do not use it
le an intense treatment i'm sure you'd get very fast
bam issue fixed while still having great looking skin
you must purshase this stuff like now
when people say "you look so great
thought it wouldn't be good for me honestly
they've me hooked i now own 5 face oils along with good genes
anytime i feel like i might be getting some rough texture
i feel like it has seriously helped smooth out my skin
i kind of like that
i feel like it lets me know it's working.
my skin is thanking me so much for it!
this is a miracle cream, for sure.
always trying things to make my complexion better
i am definitely glad i made the splurge
it has genuinely changed the texture of my face
my skin has honestly never looked better.
i do not have any issues with this i definitely see a difference when i skip this step in my skin care routine for a while
it's definitely super "wet" looking
this stuff is no joke.
i always get compliments on my skin
i really enjoy this product.
i needed something that would brighten my skin
i love everything about it
definitely give it a try
i loved how it made my skin feel
i think it has just the right amount of acid
my mom keeps telling me how much younger i look!
it has definitely made a difference
i would definitely recommend this product!
for me to see results
my makeup goes on flawless i got so many compliments yesterday
thankfully i've never had to pay for this it is always gifted to me cause i ain't got the funds for this fam
asked what im doing differently
because it really really do a great job in minimizing pores on my cheek
this stuff make a helluva difference
i convinced myself it would just be an okay skin product
all my cast members joke around with me that good genes is all i talk about even in my spare time
this stuff right here is h
but i think it smells really good.
i can feel the product working after applying to my skin
this stuff is the real deal
have had acne just about my whole life
knew luna would be good for me
i really like this product
honestly...i've tried everything with my skin.
i always break out
nothing works for me
this is what really keeps your skin in shape
oh my gosh what a significant difference
i will start off by saying that everyone's skin is different
i've found some products that i love because they have given me good results over time
basically, it looks like it did 5-6 years ago!!!
like honestly it's so good
i feel that majority of the time
people still commented about how great my skin looked
had always wanted to try it
i must take good care of my skin because of all the makeup i would have to wear to all functions
the review were so good i had to try it out myself
i've always had a cream for my body
wished that good genes worked for me without making me peel
always just a zit here or there
i can definitely see the results and fast!
this still feels like strong stuff
when i get a bad breakout n i pick i have scares this stuff really helped even after 3 days
i think it's a good investment
everything i've tried has had the wow factor.
i wear a lot of crazy makeup
i struggled with really bad acne especially on my cheeks/jaw area
my gosh it's just so bad
it makes my skin feel amazing
my face has never looked this flawless in my life
tried it with good genes too
it does not suds up like detergent which personally to me makes me think the product is actually doing its job
decided to just stop everything i was using since it obviously wasn't helping
i will because i'm so happy woth how my skin looks right now
mouth it tastes so so horrible
the smell is different but not bad.
the smell is a little weird, but i'm sold.
i am so very happy i did i never usually notice a difference in my skin fromjust a cleanser
something that smells good or something that works?
i just hate the way it smells
i feel really clean
i got this in my play box i've only used it twice wasn't really impressed with the smell
when i need a really good deep clean
for the price is ok but not amazing
well, this stuff did.
i've had multiple comments on how good my skin looks
i scout honor mean when i say i am getting oily maybe 45 mins after i apply my makeup
this product does help a whole lot with that area
my whole face feels tighter
not only does my face feel tighter
i loved the way it felt on my skin.
it made my skin feel amazing
while i love the way this feels
i went into this with no expectations except to really clean my skin
feels after i use this
does it ever get my skin feeling clean
does not leave my face feeling tight
then i said what the heck
a half to really start noticing what it does
this cleanser was recommended to me by someone with a completely different skin type than me
i've always had a problem with acne
this is this is the first wash to actually give me amazing skin
every time i wash my face i feel amazing
it just makes my skin look
my skins texture feels like it did was i was 18.
my skin still feels that way
it has a little weird smell
that's okay with me
i really loved this cleanser
i feel like this product really cleans out
it definitely smells like mud
it really cleans my face
i liked the ingredients it did
you feel good about using it on your skin
although i still miss the great anti-gravity cream from clinique this comes pretty close to it
that is definitely not the case
i now find that my skin is so smooth
i just wanted a face cream
i still love it
i don't really see my face getting any worse
i really do think this works.
goes on like a dream
i do feel a bit of a tingle upon first applying
my laugh lines are looking smooth
i feel like my skin is brighter
took awhile, but i really enjoy this product now.
i feel there's better ones out there it's a shame though i loved the natural ingredients
thought want to try different oil that would help my acne scar
i actually look forward to it
people have actually said, "you are glowing!"
my skin hasn't felt like this in about 15 years i think
pretty much tried them all.
it's definitely evened out my complexion
my skin definitely looks younger
feel as though i can already see a difference
and i really love how my skin feels afterwards.
it works just like it says.
i really like that it does the job
i get compliments all the time for it
i would definitely recommend it
it's also nice to know that it has retinols in it
i love the way it just sinks right in
i feel like nothing has worked
i need to put everybody up on game!!
i would almost say i saw results instantly because it felt that good
it was looking like it needed *something*
my chest sure is
just very lose looking skin
it's hard to remember to use it every night
this stuff will really last!
it has really made my skin happier
this product is motivates me stay diligent about my night regimen
i love the smell of it, too, not too strong.

i need more time using it to really know
i really like this product.
although it isn't magic i think it really does make a difference in blurring fine lines

this works really well if you use a very small bit
i also appreciate that it is made in the us.

i love how easy it is to use
how you feel it instantly tighten your skin
i love this product -- you don't have to use very much
i think these people are on to something
it really makes a difference

i feel like this product did help clear my skin
its so freaking good.
there were always pros

this product really helps in controlling it
so this product works well for me
i would recommend this to everybody
if it smelled better, i'd give it 5 stars.

this mask is an awesome relief for tired eyes after a stressful day or just because you feel like pampering yourself for 20 minutes
the first is the one that really helps out

i really loved this product.
these eye masks really do feel better than a nap.

the day that she used it she said she felt relax
always keep them on h
i really loved everything about this masque.
its always nice to treat yourself
see if this really works
my eyes still feel better
it'll last me awhile, definitely worth the money.
have found that putting these masks in the refrigerator feels very nice on my eyes
i felt like i never wanted to take it off.
my eyes looked too amazing
when i had no make-up on i felt insecure
honestly changed my life!
it has really helped keep my acne under control
i feel like the people who hate this product are people who are expecting prescription results without going to a dermatologist
this stuff is amazing it comes with me when i travel
this has definitely kept them at bay
because this thing really works
i started getting really red
gets the job done
i still get some whiteheads here
why is this always "out of stock?!"
this stuff changed my life
gave me the glowing complexion i have always dreamed of
obviously this plus the glamglow super clearing mask
why my skin looked so good
probably saw very good results after a week.
i will cherish it now that i see my skin reacting without it
i take very good care of my skin
this is just so fantastic in many ways i cannot explain it
feel it works well
this really helped clear up my acne
it's really keeping my skin clear
i wanted to make sure it really worked before i left a review
this is what works for me.
i love this product and my skin looks way better!
i liked this stuff
when i remember to do both, my skin looks great.
it has really balanced out the oil
i really like it
definitely helps my acne
you just have to make sure your face is clean to get the best effect
i actually love the feeling of it on my skin.
this stuff has truly helped my skin.
so make sure you use a good moisturizer
wanted something to help clear up my skin
maybe because i was in a very humid
my skin also looks really smooth
is doing just as well as the old one for me
it really does control it well
anyway i think this is a good product
i like them a lot.
you can really feel
this is helping me clear my milia!
this stuff never let me down it so good.
i feel like the texture of my skin has changed
i could tell that it was really pulling the impurities from my skin
really like this product
it's a good deal for amount of product you get.
i work out a lot
which i thought looked good
my skin definitely didn't look good after a week of wear
feel like how can i possibly still have acne
this product truly worked for me
because almost all of them make me feel heavy
i feel it does better for my under eye
just started using moisturizer so nothing to really compare it to
my face feels good at the end of the day
you can feel the strech the firts times that you use this
it goes on really lightly
who need something light
it feels good on your face
to be honest i liked it
i always have 3 im fighting with coming
this stuff has helped to balance my skin so well
that is enough to do my whole face neck
he is not normally a "product" kind of guy
i really like it!
i spent years having either very good skin or very bad
there was nothing i could find that could consistently keep my skin looking good
it really keeps me oil free all day
it really does work
it smells nice unlike most face products i have had the oppurtunity to use
you dont need a lot of the product to get the job done
i really only got a couple of applications out of it
it makes my skin look so good.
really makes your skin look flawless
it really absorbs into my skin well.
really helps with acne
just because i get bored
the face wash is great it just really dries your skin out so paying $42 is worth it for me knowing that it will go a long way
i really like it
have always had a hard time finding a moisturizer that hydrates without making me look like a greaseball
you just might love it like me!
especially when i put makeup on
i'll admit, i gave her a pretty tall order.
it absorbs really well
i love the way this feels
i love wearing it by it self too!
no matter what i do my face is always an oil slick an hour after i put on my makeup
makeup especially if you want a flawless skin
it feels so light
this certainly helps control that
you can always put a very fine touch of oil free moisturizer where you need it
makes your face look great even without makeup.
i never really bought it for that concern specifically
it really really helps
i definitely recommend it.
as you know by having this type i get really oily around my t_zone
this product really works
lasts all day really
"stay matte" sounded like just what my skin needed
this has really changed my makeup routine.
but my skin never feels tight.
this works really really well
i feel like i can finally stop looking
do not feel any discomfort
i really love this product.
i really wanted to give it a try
feel of this cream on my face
my skin tone is sooooo even it looks like i'm wearing foundation
doing the job it says to do.
my skin has never looked so clear
wanted to get the product for herself as well
this one really works for me
it seriously makes your skin firmer to the point your skin feels different
i could actually feel my face "tighten"
not in a good way
you definitely want to use this only at night
you should definitely give it a try
eyes really seem smoother
i love how it makes my skin feels firmer too
co workers actually coming up to me asking what i've done different
quite frankly nothing has come close to this product
at work my coworkers say my skin looks healthier
i am flabergasted with how fast i noticed my skin feeling
this stuff makes my skin feel great.
feel a difference in my skin
i feel that it goes on light
the cream is a little think for my taste
i still feel like this "balances" my skin out
the only bummer is that my skin really only has that improved look right after using the mask
liked it well enough to purchase
very ligut on skin amd absorbs easily without leaving a weird feel on the face
i really love it
all in all i really enjoy this product
s is a really good word for what it does
i will say it feels amazing on my skin
i began to be able to see what it was really doing for my skin
it really does work
it's fun to get a few extra products with it for basically the same price
okay, i'm obsessed with this stuff.
a half to do my whole face
i will always love how hydrating this stuff is.
i already felt the difference on my face
you really feel this product being soaked up into your skin
it's feels really light
this works wonders on my skin
box that i really liked
my makeup always ends up looking awful because my skin is so flaky
no makeup was sitting right on me no matter how nice it usually looks
which i really appreciate
it goes on really light
it is really a good one for summer
i love how it makes my skin look
it works really well as a moisturizer
i really like how light it is
it made me skin feel very smooth
really made a big difference in my acne
i do feel like it has helped reduce my redness
it's working for me
i realized a month in that i wanted something to treat my light wrinkles
it definitely helped out
this stuff really works wonders
how my skin is
this stuff has saved me :) love love love it.
this will always be part of my beauty regimen.
i would still choose to use this in the mornings because this one absorbs really well
it really helped save my skin
everytime i see her we have a 5-10 minute conversation about how much we love this stuff
i loved it so much that i thought i would try caudalie's firming serum too
but this one, she loved it!
using the two together certainly isn't cheap
i really like this one
makes my skin feel, look & smell amazing :-)
as for the smell, i really enjoy it.
it reminds me of summer!
i see in a lot of the reviews people saying it isnt good for hair
my hair felt so good
it worked sooo well for me
i also use it pretty much all over my body when i want my skin to be soft
glowey summer legs here you come!
i love the way it feels
i love the way it makes my skin feel
i personally enjoy it
i couldn't stop looking at myself in the mirror
feel on my skin
i love the smell and feel of this oil.
this is definitely my go to when i hop out the shower
i can feel it absorb very quick
which makes me feel very uncomfortable every time
this definitely does was it says it is supposed to do
so this works for me
i really enjoy the scent too.
i felt so weird putting oil on my face
my skin is now so soft i get people to feel it.
i quite honestly think it is better
i swear my foundation never blended so good
i love the feel
definitely helps my foundation set a lot smoother
i really enjoy using this product.
i find it best to mix oils if you have a keen sense of smell
le this stuff- especially when it smells as good as this one does
what a difference in my face
i love how my skin just loves it
feel like i'm quickly becoming an oil junkie
really really love this oil so far.
i really like this oil.
i love how this oil makes my skin feels
she is always raving about it.
something about it feels really decadent
think i will continue doing so
this is my one line of products where everything i buy is always a big hit
always does what it says
never agrivatea my crazy skin
i love he whole line!
really love the scent
made my skin feel as good as new
one thing to note is that the fragrance is quite strong though i do like the scent
if you like smelling nice, just buy this!
this stuff smells so good i want to eat my arms after applying
how have i lived my whole life without knowing about this stuff?
love this whole line.
this mask definitely lives up to its name!
it really helps with the after-effects
i didnt think i was gonna love it so much
i think it's a really great value
i love this mask i really recommend!
feels so good after using it
if my skin is really acting up
this is the only thing that feels good.
so winter is pretty bad
if i ever overexfoliate or feel tight after cleansing
i really enjoyed it
this definitely took care of it
has always wanted to try a mask
i couldn't tell a huge difference with my skin
i feel like i have new skin
i will say that sometimes my skin starts to feel a bit warm
always have it in my drawer
t's hard for me to find beauty products that work for me
this always does the trick!
i love how my skin looks after this mask.
i really like this mask.
i still have pretty bad texture
this stuff worked wonders
my face always feels very moisturizer
so my makeup looked horrific everyday
my entire face definitely felt smoother
this definitely is basically the same thing for like 1/4 of the price
it has a very very light smell that even reminds me of the other mask
definitely recommend and definitely repurchasing
i wasn't a big fan of the way it smelled.
really this is tops.
this is definitely one of their st
i can really tell the difference in my skin's texture
in the morning my face would look so good
my skin always looks so plump
this stuff is a miracle
i think the price for it is great too
i like the feeling of putting this on my face
i could instantly feel the difference in my skin
my skin did feel a bit smoother
great addition to the collection if you are mask obsessed like i am
as everyone knows this past winter hasn't been easy
i put a quite a bit on
this mask definitely works!
this makes my skin very hard to deal with
i love how it feels
like i said i put a good layer on.
this helps a whole lot
i would like to say that we are sorry your experience was not positive when you tried our mask
thought i would try it to see if it would just calm the itchy feeling i had on my face
every time i use it i feel like i am treating myself to a special at home treatment
this product really does what it says.
for a mask i feel like the price is honestly not bad at all
this really does work
i expect that this will work great for awhile
i needed something to give me some moisture
i really like the feel of this product.
i think it definitely keeps the oil production down
you don't need to use a lot of the product to get great results
it is definitely my go to moisturizer
only moisturizer that i have found that i really like/love
is really amazing how matifying can be.
does a pretty neat job nonetheless
i really like this moisturizer for my t-zone as it really does mattify
you can barely feel it on my face
it feels like a dream on the skin.
i really like this product!
you don't need to use a lot as it applies very nicely
it makes my face feel very smooth
i really love this product
i really use very little
hate how i get shiny pretty quickly in the day
this stuff is great, but when used as directed!
i do like this stuff
so my face is loving me right now.
the nice lady that was helping me out at sephora told me this might happen
since i have a whole bunch of different moisturizers i decided against it
i get many compliments on how flawless my skin looks now
i really need to go back to sephora
thank the pretty blond girl who heard my plea because she knew immediately that it was not my make up that was making me look oily
it does feel definately light weight
this product has done wonders for me.
this really controls oil
t really does a good job acting as a boarder between your foundation
don't like to give 5 stars to products because there is always room for improvement
i definitely recommend trying it!
this really is a "rescue cream"
this moisturizer however really does the job
it also helped me figure out my skin type
this really helps to keep it fresh
overall i really liked this moisturizer
i've never experienced a product that tames it quite like this one
i always thought my skin was combination
it really works wonders on me!
it's been so difficult to find products that actually help my face feel good
it really does feel soothing.
at the end of the day it takes a pretty good beating
really enjoy this for the winter
my skin has never been so flawless!
i've always struggled with my dark circles
nothing compares to this stuff
it makes my makeup look really really good
it does make the skin there nice
this really has helped eliminate dark circles for me
really loved the finished look -- i do color correct normally
this really does work
i really like what this product does
i do feel like it helps my dark circles
i still believe in this product because it helped me
this is really quick to use in the a.m.
it does a good job when u look really tired.
so entails a lot of my job
though as fun as it sounds
in this case i basically wanted something that would help my concealer look better
it definitely does that
for me this is hard to believe
do use a lot of it
this stuff works wonders
overall i feel it does as it claims
so you should really take advantage of that
i would definitely recommend this product
it's definitely a giant step in the right direction
i do really like it
i really like the sheer
this is just a base layer i think.
i've always had dark circles
i don't feel it has
this has become a major problem for me especially when i am tired
has a nice feel to it as you apply it with a special applicator
i still look tired
they're not light enough for me to be comfortable enough to wear contacts
plus i feel like i have to rub it in a long time.
honestly can see a different in my dark circles
this dark circle corrector truly does for me what it claims to do
i really like this product--it delivers.
it definitely helps wake me up!
has done such amazing things for my skin after acne scars
feeling really down about my complexion
they used to be really dark
it make your face really good.
this products seems working pretty well.
i feel this product really soothes my irritated
i honestly feel like this product changed my skin for the better
very good i would recommend to anyone.
and this definitely suits my skin alot better.
love this company i love all the products especially this is a product i can't go without having it with me it makes me feel like i just spent a day at the spa
my face definitely was missing this stuff
i struggled for a very long time with what i thought was combination skin
it definitely packs a punch
my boyfriend started using it as well because it's been so great
just loved the results
i kept thinking about it
feels nice going on
if anything i think it helps my foundation go on smoother
even my boyfriend can see a difference in my skin
actually helped to even our my skin tone
my skin hasn't looked this good in so long
she loves it too
the thought of putting oil on my face freaked me out because the last thing i wanted was to look greasy
this oil has really made my skin look amazing without getting my pores clogged
some people have commented that there is a bad smell
i really felt it made a difference on my skin.
i always think i'm going through it too quickly
works great under any moisturizer i've tried it with too
it was just so good
it almost felt like my skin wasn't really absorbing it
was extremely iffy about putting oil on my face as the maracuja oil made me breakout so bad
one day she calls to tell me how great it worked on a burn
we both cook a lot.
this one really changed my skin
whenever i forget to bring it with me i feel mu skin tight
i just love the smell and the feeling.
i honestly feel like it has given me a glow!
i really like this oil
it works wonders for my skin.
i always wake up with a very tight feeling in my skin
i never thought that an oil would work wonders on my very oily skin
this has always been my favourite.
this oil is actually life changing for me.
the smell to me is not a big deal
order the big one because i wanted to try it so badly
someone told me to wear this under makeup
definitely give this a try for day
this is definitely the one
i love the feel of this oil!
it really moisturize it the right way
ill definitely buy the big size when its done.
i've really been enjoying it
this however really worked for me
under makeup it works well for me
one thing i really love is that it seems to smooth my skin also
this stuff is simply amazing.
my skin has never looked so good
together my skin is starting to look way better
this product really helps
i would definitely suggest giving it a try
i truly think this kept my melesma at bay
so trying out new skin products is always a challenge
i like how refreshing it feels on my face
i feel that it is making a difference in my skin condition
trust me this stuff will last you a while
my skin was looking really tired
truly save my face & confidence!!
one thing i have learned is that because it has a bit of oil
haven't found anything that can truly improve the situation
i've always had dark circles
nothing had really worked
and my face can feel so light .
this one works for me
definitely helps my skin look much
i don't care because the product works that good
continuously get compliments on how nice my skin looks
feel like it really makes a difference in skin tone
and it definitely worked for me.
i started using this stuff
good skin matters to me
i really like it
i like to use the included pads because i feel like i use less product that way
i feel my skin get quite better with this amazing products
this product works for sure
my skin is really looking flawless
this solution has definitely made my skin look like i've had a peel
i truly thought i would have to have laser surgery to remove my scars
i tried a lot of things
buy with confidence it really works.
then 2 people told me i had beautiful skin
so make sure you use moisture
secondly, my skin looks brighter.
this even makes my skin feel amazing
knowing i cans still look good without makeup
i started getting very bad brake outs
definitely helped my skin.
when you wake up it's definitely there
this really does help
see how that helps
overall, i really like it.
confirming that i just can never be one of those lucky people whose skin is totally cool with drug store products
i love this product, it has given me clear skin.
my skin is so clear now
feel weird when i don't have it on
plus i feel like it is actually helping my skin throughout the day
i must say i really saw a huge difference in how much this controls my oil production right away
it definitely helps clear up my skin
and my boss even said my skin looked amazing!
i really love it
how it makes my skin feel
tightening buy really does the trick
i took one star off because i really don't like the pump
it has definitely helped improve my skin
i've had acne my whole life
nothing seemed to really work for me
i definitely recommend this mask to people suffering from acne
this stuff works pretty well.
it does work pretty well
when i woke up the next morning i could not feel any bumps on my skin plus my tiny breakouts were gone which was unbelievable yes a miracle people won't believe
would really recommend buying this skin
would definitely recommend it
nothing was working for me
i found this on here
hope this helps someone else as it helped me achieve a healthy complexion after many years of battling acne
i honestly just want to give the sephora girl who recommended this to me a great
i've tried everything out there
wow were they right
it really does it a good job improving my skin in a short time frame
the only thing that really controls my acne
it makes me feel like it's working
you feel it working
really does fill in some stuff
it never really "sets"
i always seem to get breakouts around my "time"
if it reacts well with your skin go for the good stuff you get what you pay for
it really keeps my oil under control
this product works really well for me
i think it really helps control the breakout
is that you need to make sure you really wash of the mask
i don't really like the container
honestly i've tried everything for my dry
i really like it
it works for me
it sounds too good to be true
using this has really helped with my difficult skin
obviously not everything is going to go away because of my hormonal imbalance
i really like this product
this definitely does that
it always happens on my chin.
i am more confident not having a bunch of acne on my chin now
one small dab is really all you need
but my skin loves this mask.
i try a lot of stuff.
sulphur really works on my acne with no backlash
it has made such a difference to my skin that a coworker asked me what i started doing differently
so kicking myself for not bringing this with me!
but it definitely does what it says it does.
you really only need half a pump to moisturize your whole face effectively
definitely worked for me.
my skin hasn't looked this good in a while
i just love the pump though!
was telling me that you could use it as a primer to control shine as well as a mask
i liked the way that it felt.
this is my go to stuff
really takes care of the breakout
just make sure to apply a good moisturizer
the first time i tried this i remember looking in the mirror thinking my makeup looked really good
i love everything that amorepacific has!
preach to you on how good this br
this stuff really will last you
i am definitely in love
i feel as though it has definitely smoothed the surface of my face immensely
i feel like this actually skinks into my skin
just think about this cream
have to say this stuff is amazing
this feels really nice on the skin
i am definitely going to purchase this
i really love it.
yes... might sounds weird but true!
i really love this product
my skin loves this stuff.
when i found out the price i said good lord
it was crazy-making
right now i am a huge fan of amorepacific products
i'd always go back to this amazing cream when browsing the site
i got over it because it feels so great on my skin
using this in the morning helps my skin stay nice
definitely noticed that i have more of that "glow" everyone is always seeking
thanks to a young sephora cast i was finally able to find a creme that makes my skin so soft
i will definitely use this creme forever
you will feel you skin so smooth!
i loved how it made my face look and feel.
it really was that good.
when i saw the price tag i thought there was no way a cream was really worth that much
i got used to the smell pretty quickly

the way my makeup looks
how my face feels
think about what you spend on a sweater
people always tell me i look like i'm in my late 20s
love the way it makes my skin feel
my husband loves to feel my face!
a lot of people are talking about the smell of this cream
definitely check it out in the store
i always wanted to try amorepacific's products.
after a hard night with the kids
it really is a shame.
the weird smell people talk about: it's definitely there
the good thing is, it goes away quickly.
then wake up to skin that really does look younger
amazing feel to my skin after using.
because you know your skin is getting all
i"m not sure exactly what to say about it other than i feel like my skin just looks good when i wake up in the morning
there are really a lot of pros to this product.
i really loved it
one thing i would definitely say is somewhat of a con is the smell
just be aware it's not that great
since i am too young for those
yeah it's that good
definitely would recommend this product.
makes you feel pretty
my skin was just tired of them
it feels really nice on the skin.
i love everything about the use of this product.
i always had to think about how i was putting it on because i wanted the dior emblem straight
but i still love the product.
the container is pretty
it has a nice feel
so you don't need much product at all for it to feel like you are completely covered
i get so many compliments on my complexion
i really think my skin has felt smoother
it's really just personal preference
everyday you are going to wake up to better looking skin
feels refreshing when you put it on your face
make sure to shake it really good.
love the scent and how it feels on my face.
i really like it.
i learned the hard way that i wasn't taking care of my skin
it definitely does prepare it for my moisturizer.
i think it is working to brighten my skin a bit
this is one of the products that just makes you feel good
i do see a difference in my skin using it.
the water-like consistency of this product makes it a bit hard to apply
the color is weird too
so my skin is in pretty good shape
it did make a huge difference in the look
i still think the product helps with my pores
this product is good if you don't have many beauty steps before bed
it works really well.
really hasn't done anything for my areas of hyper pigmentation
basically this smells really good
people have commented on how smooth my face is
definitely making my skin look
it really did brightened up my skin
i love what it did to my complexion
you will feel like you're wasting a lot of product
i feel like it's doing the job
i can definitely tell the difference in the brightness of my face
you can feel it woking.
my skin looks like it did when it was 16
nightly use i feel comfortable not wearing foundation
i really like the feel
it does feel like it is a little drying to my skin
wanted to make sure i was doing as much for my skin as possible
said she's noticed a difference as well
can definitely see an improvement in my skin
the lady there told me i had beautiful skin
i can tell a big difference in my skin already
i could really tell a difference
i guess after each application of camu my face feels exactly what i feel when drinking one of those fruit energizing smoothies after the exhausting workout at the gym
i do think it makes skin look great
not sure about the brightening thing-
it's making me feel pretty
my skin has never looked or felt so good!
i truly notice a difference in texture
this one definitely takes the cake
first thing you notice is the smell.
it really does make you want to eat it.
i really like this
it has a very nice slip to it
i feel like i have always had dark circles
that's the thing with this product
it seems to be brightening over time which is obviously great
this has really helped my eyes look younger
it really does brighten
i love this whole line by korres.
really does instantly brighten as well as lighten over time
i love the way it feels on my skin.
i keep it with me and it keeps me looking fresh.
it really lightens my circles.
definitely feel like my undereye circles have improved
definitely can notice a difference right after putting it on
you don't need to use a whole lot
feel like this review is a bit early
other than thought it smells nice
it works so well it's ridiculous: it truly is both illuminating
this stuff really goes to work immediately
the nice moisture that it gives my eyes for so little amount used definitely makes it worth it
i pretty much love every single korres product out there
i personally have no trouble putting this on my eyelids
even though it was a great review
'm a bit of a pro in this arena
it really brightens my undereyes
especially if you have bad dark circles like i do
i definitely recommend it
only con is that i feel like i'm going through this product a bit quickly
it makes it feel
finding this moisturizer was a dream come true
i swear by this stuff now
i wanted something that would hydrate my skin without making me breakout
tried this and it really works well for me.
i loved this moisturizer no matter what condition my skin was in
it always left it smooth
i loved this product for so long
it has always caught my attention
i used that up in a heart beat because my skin absolutely loved it
this stuff really makes my face feel so smooth.
i like the way it feels and i like the pump.
i really love this.
imagine if you have really dry skin this wouldn't be for you
t has been a struggle for me to find a good moisturizer
how my foundation looks
it's also not really thick so i like that.
i really like this moisturizer.
i would definitely recommend this one
i honestly go back
forth on how i feel about it
this does feel great when you first put it on
so my face is pretty st
i felt like it didn't do enough to really moisturize my skin during the winter
this one was just okay
maybe 15 or 20 would be good
it has done wonders.
i really like this moisturizer.
i really do love this moisturizer
this alone is pretty huge for me.
and the pump is great so you dont waste product.
have a lot to deal with when it comes to my skin
never makes my skin feel heavy
everywhere else gets extremely dry especially around my eyes
definitely a staple in my skin care routine.
with none really doing enough for me to purchase again
at the same time it does a nice job of making my face feel moisturized
like the feel of it
this stuff is just amazing it won't keep you matte the whole day
so when the lady at sephora put this on me i was really nervous
i do feel it makes your skin a tiny bit "tight"
i really like it
she asked me what i have been doing to my skin because it looks so radiant
that small drawback is totally worth it to me because of the results i am getting
people have always said i look about 10 years younger
still feel the need to use that
i my skin truly looks younger
she just asked me what i was doing new for my skin
it's a little hard to do but it works every time.
i really just care that it works.
it really sinks in
my skin loves this stuff.
i really just liked the smell of it
have a really hard time with moisturizers
by the end of the day my face is always super greasy no matter what i use
have never had my makeup look so good
my skin was obviously lacking a good moisturizer this was finally it
overall i loved the way it made my skin feel…not greasy
i really did see a difference in my skin
you need so little i'm pretty sure this jar will last at least 6 mos
it burns pretty bad
maybe because i have combination skin
numerous friends have said to me out of nowhere that my skin looks like it's glowing
makes my skin feel great totally addicted to the product line would recommend it to anyone seeking moisture without the greasy side effects
i really feel like there's a difference in my skin
so far it's been really good
i took one star only because i do get that greasy feeling
i think my skin just neeeded to get used to it
ok so a while back i posted a less than wonderful review on this cream
thought they were just so-so
that's always been the case with my skin no matter what i use to moisturize
even i don't need a whole pump of this cream to get the job done
i really like using this moisturizer as a primer for my foundation as well
i've really seen results in just one application.
everything i use makes me break out.
she said "this stuff is great for people with acne
i really think it's because of this!
today at work one of the girls stopped me to say my skin looked amazing
it helps with my laugh lines a lot have to say
now that my face an neck are so happy to be moisturized i only use at night to give my skin the best drink ever
my skin definitely has changed since i use it
this really is a bummer
i do feel like it moisturizes my skin really well
it definitely helped with my fine lines
the only thing i wish it had was spf because i'm terrified of the sun's effects on my skin
smells so good you want to eat it!!!
feels like heaven going on
really like the pump top!
i really feel like this is tightening them
my skin feel great all day
i even get compliments from people about how great my skin looks
i really like this product.
that is the first time in my life i've ever been told that i have nice skin
i really love it
figured he has to have something for my breakouts
it felt really strong at first with a little bit of tingle
definitely not as shiny
it has been a extremely humid summer so even though i take extra good care of my skin i could really notice the pores on my nose
i never felt any "burning"
not a terrible burn or anything just enough to feel slightly uncomfortable
this definitely does what it says.
especially if it says it is going to tingle.
i'll start by saying i love this stuff
it says it tingles when you put it on
'm not sure if this would work for sensitive skin types
this did the trick so when i put it on for the very first time i fell in love because i never seen my skin so beautiful in my whole entire life
this one is a lot better i mean that one is really good
not as good as this one i think because what i need the most is something to exfoliate my skin
would definitely recommend this!!
especially when i feel like really clogged or my skins overly not pure looking
this is how i know its working
the pictures prove it... i never looked hungover!
initially, this stuff freaked me right out!
after applying i felt a really strong burning sensation
man this really goes deep
they drive me crazy
i really do love this mask!
when your face is oilier like mine it feels good to know its working
my face has felt so smoooooth all day
it really works if you can tough it out for a while
it does tingle for sure
'm pretty careful with my skin
all i really love it
this is definitely one of my favourite masks.
i personally love that feeling!
as weird as it sounds i really like the sensation
the tingling was a strong minty kind of feel- sort of like how your mouth would feel when using listerine
i wanted to try something different for a change
you will definitely feel a strong cooling feeling
to say it tingles is quite the understatement
my skin does feel a lot softer
'm not sure how good this is for sensitive or dry skin
if you do want to try definitely stick to 10 min.
good genes messed me up pretty bad
you def feel it working
'm so glad i tried youthmud because the smell is 1000x better
makes your face really tight
it really does brighten
i really liked it
as everyone has said, it definitely tingles.
really feels like it's actually doing something
i love that this mask actually feels like it's doing something
the one true thing i really disliked about this product was twin
just felt really cold
after you rinse it off your face will feel unreal
more of the good stuff
otherwise, it's really nice
overall: a great buy for when your skin really needs a lift
my friends always notice a difference in my skin the day after i use it
mother always said 'you have to suffer to be beautiful
taking it off will be amazing if you're like me
i feel like my skin feels
it does make your face feel smooth.
a friend was raving about how good my skin looked
when i told her i used this mask she said "well that's why
i love the feeling it has
it did have a very intense tingle
love it for myself
i definitely would recommend for all skin types.
i feel comfortable during my work week without foundation at this point
it feels like my face is actually burning
really evens out my skin
as crazy as it sounds
i personally recommend this because it has really balanced out my skin
this stuff is the bomb!!!
purchased it after hearing so many wonderful things about this mask
i know a lot of people have posted about how this burns a bit when you put it on
my only complaint is that i feel like you need to use a lot of product to cover your whole face
that's hard to do when they give you so little product
you don't need a lot to really feel the difference
get very little sleep
my only complaint about this stuff is that the bottle seemed to run out way too fast
this is the only thing that works for me.
this stuff meets all of my needs.
which i like a lot
i don't really have problems around eye area.
i think this product really did the major work
really can see the difference.
guess it is working for some of my eye area problems

trust me i have had heck with my acne-prone skin
the balance it gives my skin is good enough for me
ok this stuff is pretty amazing!
i've always had bad skin
it's been really hard for me to find one that doesn't make me break out or just feel gross on my skin
when i look in the mirror it's the skin of someone who i would say "wow she has great skin
my whole face just looks younger
hope this helps someone!!!
i know how frustrating it is to find a good product
who knew i could quite tinkering with my face?
i won't ever feel like i need plastic surgery
cleansing your skin is the most important step before doing anything else with your skin
it gets into my eyes pretty easy
after trying this for a week my skin said thank you
i feel like i've tried everything
needed to try something different because my skin was breaking out
plump like i wanted
but yeah the price.... :(
i've heard good things about the br
i really like this one
i really like this product.
it feels like a regular cleanser for me with nothing too special
it feels so good to use that i've come to really enjoy washing my face
if all you are looking is a good cleanser then this is it
i would definitely recommend it!
here is what i experienced
i definitely recommend this!
it still has that great feel on my skin
this is definitely a keeper!
i would definitely recommend
it does a great job getting off even waterproof makeup
i really like this cleanser
i love how my skin feels after using it
i am actually getting compliments on my skin now
i actually felt like it was cleansing
this gave my face a totally different clean feel.
without making it feel tight
as someone who had never used an oil cleanser before i was nervous it was going to make my skin break out
felt nice circulating it on my skin
so using an oil-based cleanser has always scared me a bit
it really does a great job removing eye make-up including mascara
she told me that my skin looked great
i am 40 so recently i started feeling "not so young
" so this compliment made me feel amazing
i feel this product will last someone a very long time
i would definitely recommend this product.
i think it's very important to clean your skin
i swear the first time i used it my whole face felt different
love how this makes my skin feels
this stuff is serious business
first off i love the feel of this on my skin.
if you feel like spoiling yourself then this is it
silky its absorb into the skin so quickly its incredible feeling after used i know sound like im too crazy for this stuff
the only thing i am not sure about this oil is its "oily" feel
it really works off all of my makeup
i really like the texture
i feel really refreshed after i use this to take my makeup off
i am definitely hooked on using this
i feel great and it lasts a long time too.
my face smells amazing all day long too
i definitely agree with this claim.
feel amazing with very little effort
have had to stop because of the summer heat was making my skin feel too greasy
told me that my skin looked great
she said it looked so smooth
she said that her skin is looking great too.
people i know have commented on how it's clear that my skin almost glows now
i love the way it smells and makes my skin feel.
i honestly do not like the feel of this cream
i feel this maybe good for a very dry
keep in mind that everyone has different reactions so this may work
just make sure you prefer a heavier feel to your products
feel of my skin definitely improved
i can definitely tell a difference between using it
i really love this stuff!
i really like the container it is in
the product is so pretty.
this is really wow.
i’m dying just thinking what my husb
will think if he catches me doing that
not really sure what is in this stuff
like you could go without makeup pretty
i looked up a lots of stuff
i really love it.
has even started borrowing some since it's making my skin look great
i found this product to be just okay.
really makes you feel like you are using a very high end product
i think you really are paying a lot for the look
my eyes did not feel uncomfortable
at first i wasn't sure how i felt about this product
love how my skin looks
i love how light it feels
people keep telling me i look younger
this is definitely a treat
feels like it did in my 20's
i really love the texture of this product too
i do see a huge difference with my skin tone
i really love this product!
i think it is making a difference in my skin
it really does wonders
i really want to like this br
definitely not for the faint of heart
i know good genes are part of this
actually makes me want to touch my face -my skin feels wonderful
the feeling of my skin after i use it
it has a pretty thick consistency so you don't need much for it to really work
it has a really rich feel upon application as well
i can really feel my skin start firming especially around my chin/neck area
makes my skin feel really good
the lancôme definitely leaves my skin feeling nicer
i can really see a difference
at first i didnt think i liked it because it had a perfume scent
now i actually like the smell
for some reason it doesn’t do well under my eyes
i will continue to use it since it feels so nice
i just wanted something to hydrate my eye area.
definitely recommend this to all skin types!
my eyes haven't looked this good in years!
i look and feel so great!
love this product, it works for sure.
like many of us here, i am a face cream junkie!
this is the only eye cream i feel has ever worked
especially after a not so great night of sleep
the really don't like the packaging
my make up stays looking good all day
it was hard for me to believe an eye cream that did what its described
really got me was it said you could use on the upper lids
that's just as important eye area to take care of in the long run
so you can imagine my skin
i got this and really see quite a difference.
i definitely notice a difference under my eyes since using this
i like how it makes the skin around my eye feel nice
none of them really work
are really looking bad
make up goes on smooth and has a nice feel.
once you take it off you really see a difference
i liked the feeling because i could tell it was actually doing something
she felt the same way
i wanted to love the sephora one
i think it overdried my skin a bit.
so that was a nice effect
i kind of like the feeling
it makes me feel like it's really getting into my pores
this stuff is the best honestly
i love the willowbark actually inside this mask!
i guess that's just my skin.
i would definitely recommend.
it made me break out like crazy
use it a few more times because it really will make your skin look incredible
obviously it's pretty pricey for a small container
this is the first one i truly see a difference in
it was really bad
it rinces off pretty easy
loves when i do this mask because he thinks it looks so cool lol
it gets the job done.
this mask definitely helps with acne
basically gave myself a chemical peel without really wanting one
that's a whole other story
s that were always pretty great
the leaves are a little weird
this product is definitely not overrated.
that being said when i first apply this mask it feels cool
this one really made a difference for me
you feel a bit of a tingle
the way i look at my skin
it is actually fascinating seeing everything extracted because it shows that it actually works
its honestly quite refreshing since it is getting deep into your skin
i think i said "wow" so many times
it definitely helped with my acne as well.
most things don't work for me
as i was washing it off my face i actually said "oh my god" because i could tell my skin looked better
knowing that this mask is doing its job
after 20 minutes of this mask on it it was ready to be popped thats what really made me like this mask
honestly love this stuff
i would definitely recommend this product
let me just start by saying that everyone's skin is different
makes my face feel after using it
really love the way it makes my skin feels
this is still the best for my really bad breakouts
this mask really works to pull all the dirt
they've all been pretty good
it does make my face pretty red for about 30-60 minutes afterwards
it was honestly really uncomfortable
really gets the job done
t is hard to find a good mask that will help control oil
i do really love this mud mask
clears up my problem acne fairly fast too i only need to use this if i feel like my face needs a real good clearing the only complaint i have is that this mask is almost too aggressive it does definetly turn your face red after using it
but it does feel like it's working its magic.
it felt like a burn
i love this stuff so much!
i feel that i really have been seeing a difference
whenever i feel that my skin feels really congested
when i tried this product i loved how it shows you all your little blackheads
have a heck of a time really getting it clean
i really let it sit in
otherwise it really is a bit of waste
after all your face is the first thing everyone sees
it's pretty effective and i love the smell of it.
i still love it.
am always nervous about trying new masks because a lot of them leave me red
this stuff is seriously amazing.
love the way it feels on the face
the way it makes my face feel after
if not i'll definitely continue using it just to clean out my pores
it is very hard to get all the product out without making a big mess
i've always had really big pores on my nose to the point where my foundation falls off because of all the oil
you should definitely give it a chance
i will probably talk myself into investing in the big jar
i can feel the tingling as the product goes to work
have found myself not wearing foundation as much
my skin really improved
it's really good as a spot treatment too.
i feel like i got a bad batch the second time though
i read that many people swear by this for `lifting` everything up a bit
all of that make my make up looked horrible
i wanted something that can keep my pro acne skin under control
just makes my skin feel good
you should do everything to make it beautiful
wanted to try something different after my clinique
love this product, especially in the winter time!
i really love this product!
it makes me so happy when i rub this product in
i would definitely recommend this product!
i really enjoy the texture
it does smell really
which i guess is different than others here
this stuff is pretty pricey
i definitely recommend this product.
but i love this stuff!
i am always told how beautiful my skin is
i think i have finally found the right moisturizer for my combo skin
when i put it on my face i can feel it start to work
since i started using this my skin looks flawless everyday
this thankfully has really calmed down my skin.
i can feel the difference in my skin
i love the way it feels and smells.
well i have tried everything from big br
my skin always feel really tight
said my face feels nice
i definitely recommend this
overall, i really like it.
works really well with my foundation when i go for a light dewy look
i really like this moisturizer.
i don't know how well it's going to work on very dry skin
this really did save my skin!!
my skin always gets difficult when that happens
i know everyone's skin is different
really keeps you shine free all day as well
i wore it all day nothing else and i loved it.
this has work so good it last pretty much for all the day maybe 10 hours if you never retouch your makeup like me
this stuff is for you
i love the feel of it.
i like this product because it has the right consistency
i liked it right away
i don't look like i just worked out
nothing makes my skin feel as good as this one
it works well for me
the only bad thing about this is the smell
i can definitely tell that my skin has been looking so healthy with a nice glow
i will endure the smell since i do think this is improving my skin
i will always thank her
it definitely helps with my dryness
heard really good things about this product from others
i've honestly received so many compliments from friends
even strangers on how nice my skin looks
definitely recommend, i love love love this oil
this stuff has certainly become a staple product
it keeps it just right
i think it does a good job of keeping my extremely dry
not to mention the big bottle looks pretty sitting on my makeup table
this stuff is really good
i noticed my skin looked so great
my skin has never looked or felt better
maybe i got a bad one.
it works really good for my skin and hair.
i feel like this product is good for fine lines
i always feel good when i use this.
but it still makes me feel so good!
figured out maracuja oil actually helps lighten them
i can really tell the difference
this stuff really is beyond amazing.
definitely buying my own
i heard a lot about this oil
some said that it has a bad smell, okay.
everything made it so smooth
i loved how my face looked
i would definitely recommend friends to get this!
i really loved this product
but don't smell really good
you've got to be creative about how
'm not sure if i've noticed any improvement of skin texture or fine lines
in one night this stuff helped my face.
this stuff is magic.
i honestly put it on after my moisturizer
i feels it really helps balance my skin
really important to see if it works for your skin
now my skin is like
i can definitely tell that my face looks
at first i thought maybe it was just the accutane that was making my skin look really good
i noticed that my skin was still looking amazing
sometimes other times of the day if i feel like my skin can use a little refreshing
i am very oily so that was amazing
it feels so good
this stuff makes my face feel amazing!!
minus the pretty packaging
they work pretty well for my skin
it has really changed my life.
have taken poor care of my skin because it was pretty flawless forever
i really don't think it could be a waste of money if you get creative
there is definitely a smell
i'll forever use this stuff

this stuff is the right consistency for both morning
i think it makes my skin look nice
this stuff makes your skin feel amazing.
i know all skin is different
i think it's great for all skin types honestly
it's definitely one of the products that's able to balance out my skin
i am not sure that i would use this cream every day since it is a bit thick
i really liked it
i wanted something a little different for my routine
i did recommend this to my dad who is trying to take better care of his skin
(he likes it - so cute.)
i would definitely recommend it.
weirdly i like this product so much i actually look forward to putting it on morning

over all i really liked it.

there is a perfect balance if you apply a little
i really love this product.
i just really hate the smell.
this stuff smells a little funny
then apply this to my skin it feels amazing
i can definitely tell a difference if i run out
i wanted a good moisturizer that had some anti aging aspects to it
this cream did something pretty amazing
feeling just as confident if not more because my "natural skin" is just as beautiful as my make up

every time "oh my gosh you're face is just so soft
definitely would recommend for people with oilier skin

because this stuff really works
i am only 23 so the "lines" i have are very fine
definitely too expensivefor my taste.
i kid you not- i feel like i just got my entire face plumped
this product really seems to keep its promise.
actually had a few comments on how great my skin looked the first day
it really does take care of those fine lines under my eyes
nothing truly makes them go away

the tube says it takes 3 weeks or something like that
never really saw results

my scars are so light now that they are basically gone

i feel it really helps with my elasticity concerns
i feel like i'm already fighting them off
this really is a product that does what it says it will
this is just so convienant

i find that my skin sucks it right up.
i feel like i don't have to wear as much foundation lately

im still young(24) so i just want to prevent.
i really love the two new products i have found
i would definitely recommend this product to anyone considering it
you definitely get what you pay for
i really can see a difference in my skin.
i really love how this absorbs so quickly.
i looked at what a difference what a beautiful change
doesn't break me out so overall pretty good except for the pilling
i can say it has made a great improvement in my skin
i really did see a difference in my complexion
i actually feel that this is working.
i really felt that i needed to post another review for this product as my first one was quite negative
feel the difference this cream is making to my skin
it just was not giving the very best results
at night time i always did cleanser
i really love this moisturizer.
so this has really helped me out
it's definitely helped with my break outs
i don't feel as if they've changed a whole lot
definitely helped change the texture of my skin
am always on the lookout for a moisturizer that will not cause me to breakout
i definitely recommend this product
and this one definitely does.
every time i get facials or i get makeovers done it sephora i get complimented on how nice my skin is
i definitely love this product
somehow controls my oil really well
i can really feel it working when i put it on.
honestly i'm in love with this product
the smell is so so
it feels really nice putting it on after using my cleanser
just what my skin needs
i really wanted to give it 5 stars
i also love the smell of this product, too.
i never feel greasy
ask if i was doing something different since my skin looked so smooth
you get used to it pretty quickly
my skin has never looked this flawless.
really balances your skin tone for an even
which is always a plus
i feel that at my age
always had a tough time finding any kind of cream or moisturizer for my face
it's been about 4 years since i felt good about my skin
this is what i've been doing
it's definitely getting better
so of course my face looks horrible
just love how this feels on the skin
as i applied it it felt as if it was giving my face a cleansing feeling i must say after having it on it made my face complexion seem a lot more shiny
i really like it because it keeps my acne
you can still feel smooth
i can feel the chemistry working on my skin
i really like it
you can really see the different
i really like it
i love how smooth it goes on
also, this stuff smells seriously amazing.
it really truly works
i really can see a difference.
i am actually loving this whole line of products.
it really helped my skin look
does not leave the skin feeling really quenched
i do like the way it makes my skin look.
love the way it makes my skin feel
i can tell such a huge difference in my skin
i've never seen my face so flawless
how nice i look since i started using this
when it comes to our pores us woman
really really struggle to find a product to shrink or pores
it was like a primer for me
don't know how well it'll be for people with big pores
this seems to really work.
the people that see me their often commented on how amazing the results were
this makes my eyes look less tired
you were looking really awful [nice]
my only objection is that it is pretty pricey
its probably as good as it gets for my situation
i feel like i waste a good bit of this product as it goes a long way
see i am right
it really felt like your bff saying
it's hard to know how objective i can really be
so love this product.
-- if you really want to see dramatic results in your eyes
have always struggled w dark circles
i love the consistency of this stuff.
it feels like it actually "stays" unlike some other product that feels like it slides right off
i feel my skin tighten after using it
i still have a good
this stuff is a win all around!
unfortunately by doing this
i heard that retinol is supposed to be good for dark marks
when i put this stuff on
would definitely recommend this product.
it's definitely helped with the lines around my eyes
i feel this is a very nice product
so definitely put a moisturizer on top
i got this in addition to my eye cream because i felt like i still had dark circles
this actually works on my dark circles.
i feel like i have tried everything…
this stuff actually works for me!!
feel it's worth the effort hoping my skin will adjust
i am constantly asked what i use on my skin because i am told i look much younger than 61
yes it's great and worked within 2 weeks!
this one is working really well.
eyes look and feel better.
i like how it felt when putting it on
this stuff really works for me.
the whole eye area really is so smooth.
i really like this
really feels like it's making a difference
i would definitely suggest using an eye cream with it
definitely need to use a cream w this product as i think it would be too drying w/ out one
so most really work for others to
this one specifically i have obviously been applying around my eyes
really helps with dark circles
i no longer feel like i have to have concealer everyday it has done a good job
i really like the way this worked with my skin
my genetics aren't too great either
i really love this product
i am the type i really like to take the product all around my eye
hopefully tarte can change this part!
i actually feel like the area around my eyes are instantly refreshed
i put this stuff under one eye
they look so good
it really does brighten my dark under eye circles
as you age stuff happens but this stuff is great.
it's just a good feeling cream to use
i feel this eye cream is a good value
this stuff really works!!
this cream really helped
its a great product i would really recommend it to everyone
such a nice eye cream both myself who is just noticing some signs of aging
i wear very little makeup
had to switch to something else due to a weird reaction
it gets the job done!
i didn't realize how good this eye cream was until i saw it work it's magic on mature skin
however i find that it isn`t really great under make up
especially if you love wearing eye makeup everyday
overall i really like this product
im pretty sure the oil will also be great to use
i really like this eye cream.
i do not have very dark under eyes
really like this eye cream very smooth
this has really made my eyes smoother
i really like it.
i really love the way this product adds light to my under eye area
it rubs in really well
it really, honest and truly works.
i think i have found my life-long buddy here
when i figured it out man it was great haha
but other than that i really really love it.
my dark circles are pretty well gone
i like this a lot
definitely softer around eyes.
sure will be great for many
it's great for people like me who likes to stay up late
since i don't really like the idea of having to buy two different eye creams
just knew i would love
love everything about it
a real struggle for me
it goes on pretty easily
smells so good - like oranges a little!
i kid you not... it was gone!
i really only use it for my face
i wanted something gentle enough for around my eyes
you should definitely see a difference
only have good things to say about this product!
this stuff literally is a life saver
it has really helped the texture.
it feels so good on the face
this is a great all purpose moisturizer that's not too heavy i especially love putting it on my lips before bed time
although it does initially feel greasy going on
it definitely left a shine
i think it's great as a step before applying makeup
great hand moisturizer too, especially at night.
even though it's a pretty heavy duty oil it still manages to feel really light on your face
the good thing is the smell doesn't really linger after you put it on
i like it a lot
this product is basically a do-it all!
i even use this on my kids!
it's definitely more of a night time moisturizer for me
it works really well during the winter
this stuff is actually healing my lips.
i never really used it much despite loving
my hairdresser said my ends look better!!!
i wanted to try this so badly
i might be switching to this for the winter it's so good
this stuff is a miracle
this stuff is intense!!
i really like it :)
makes me look like i've been on a vacation or a really good long weekend
i literally am in love with all things josie maran now
first- i am a guy
it keeps my face looking
i really feel the combo of this cream
i can see a huge difference in my neck, too!
i am in no way in love with it
this stuff is a life saver for me
easy to take with you everywhere you go
really recommend this product
i get compliments regularly on how nice my complexion looks
it really works for me
the smell is great it always makes me smile
i get compliments all the time about my skin
how young i look
sometimes you really do get what you pay for.
i don't think i will ever stop using this cream as it feels light around my eyes
my eye area feels
i love it and will definitely repurchase!
none have really done anything significant for me
guess what the puffiness was completely gone
have always worked well for me in the past
so maybe this product isnt strong enough for everyone
so the winter here is very harsh
that's the other good thing.
the kind that i hope says
really like this eye cream.
decided to really pay attention
i've never slept well my entire life so the bags underneath my eyes have always been a problem area
i feel like it's taken 5 years off my face
i really like it.
it makes the skin around my eyes feel great
it feels really nice
i can really tell the difference in the morning when i find my face so soft
it feels so good when you put it on as well
i would like to say it is definitely one of the bests
really does what it claims for.
my eyes love this stuff
i always am told i look younger than i am
it is your skin doing this!
anyway, my feel has been responding well to this.
i would definitely recommend!
no joke i can already tell a huge difference in the hydration of my skin
this is the best $8 i've ever spent in my life that's how much i love this stuff
it doesn't make my skin look great
the value is pretty good considering you don't need that much for your whole face either
this makes my skin look and feel so good.
be good to your face while you sleep ♡ you have to be consistent to see results
keep that in mind about everything in life
really evens out my skin
i really like this "mask
i really love this product
i could still feel some of it sitting on my skin
this stuff is like magic!
i like that you leave it on all night so your skin really has a chance to drink up the moisture
if feel like i need a little "umph" to it
this stuff does great things!
as all dry skinned people know the winter is the true test of a moisturizer: i'm happy to report that it is still doing a great job
this mask works really well.
i definitely want to keep using it
i definitely recommend it!!
now when i wake up my skin feels incredibly smooth
we have hard water
so things were really not going my way for moisturized skin
i really live this
you can feel it going to work
i've always had such a hard time finding a moisturizer that could help
so when i gave this guy a try i was honestly blown away
clinique really has a home run hit here.
i truly notice the difference in the morning
this stuff makes me want to return to my old moisturizer
come morning my face just feels amazing
which have done wonders for my acne
i know everyone is different
i hope this helps those who have my skin type
my skin always feels amazing after
decided to purchase the whole thing
could definitely see the difference in the morning
'm not sure about the cleansing part
my face felt pretty amazing after using it
i think i just really wanted this brush too
the brush is great for application because i do not feel like i am wasting it
leaves my skin feeling really nice
the next morning he said "wow your skin looks so nice
i just love this, it works so well.
it's soft texture make me feel so good everytime i use this mask
the smell is really appealing
it's very nice to not have to worry about them drying out
whenever i buy a large container i feel like i don't get a chance to use the whole thing before it dries out
in fact every time i can feel a littel pain
always feel fresh after using it
this is what my skin needs
it' still does an amazing job
i really like it
the blush is really good too
so you actually feel like something is happening
i can't wait to feel how smooth my skin will be when i'm finished
it does tingle a bit when you first put it on
i've got my mom hooked too
this masks is amazing my skin is always so clear
he really liked it too
i really like this product!
friends say my face looks like porcelain.
makes me feel like an artist with the brush that is included
the only downside is that it makes my skin feel burning when my face is not in a good state
my skin really feels healthy after i use it!
you feel and see the difference.
really good product as part of a type of treatment of your needs
i couldn't help but feel my face all day.
this was still very refreshing on my skin
i really recommend it to those who love masks
i would definitely recommend this mask.
i found out there's a huge difference of my face
applying this feels so good.
really there is enough product in a pod for 2 people
feel compelled to share this with everyone
i really love this mud mask!
love the whole thing!
so believe me, i went through a lot.
i literally felt a difference in my skin texture
really dislike the packaging
face looks really clean
see how it works
i do love the way it feels on the face
i definitely found it in this!
sometimes i feel like my skin is even glowing afterwards
i love this stuff and will continue to use it.
since a smooth layer is all you need to really get results
t is hard for me to find a good mask
i really do love the texture
hoping that it would not irritate my skin since it felt so smooth
this seemed to really give the blackheads a run for their money :
this stuff works wonders!
it helps tremendously to have that brush because i feel like i'm able to put the mask on more evenly
i really like it cause i can feel
then you feel it energizing
i like the feeling of putting it on
this mask is really smooth and fun to put on.
let me tell you of my pleasant surprise
makes it feel like true spa experience at home
i would definitely recommend this to friends.
boscia thought of that in this product
feels like a dream on my skin
i really love this product.
definately does what it says
this product works wonder for me!
i could feel my face getting softer
but it definitely does what it says it will
love how this makes my skin feel when i wake up in the morning
i feel like it does not absorb completely into my skin
my skin feels soooo nice in the morning
i think it'd be alright
the little laugh lines i was getting
i will definitely buy this again as i feel like it's my miracle product
it really does the job
i am not seeing a difference around my eyes
i liked the feel
how my skin felt after use
my felt like my skin texture improved quite a bit
the only reason i'm giving it 4 star is because i do get a bit greasy feeling
i really like this night cream.
i really love the consistency of this night time moisturizer
i really really recommend this.
some liked it, some hated, but no one loved it.
i felt like my face felt tight
nice feel going on.
this product was everything i wanted it to be.
i love the way my skin feels after i use it
my skin still feels like it's going to crack
i personally find it pleasant
wow, i really like this stuff.
this stuff really works!!!
after just one use i could tell an amazing difference in the hydration of my skin
this product is definitely going into my loves
still works for me
my skin feels like my 10-year old's in the morning
it is truly moisturizing though which is why i am so upset it didn't work with my skin
she loves it so this may be good as long as you aren't too sensitive i guess
it really helps to control the amount of product that you use
it makes your skin feel so smooth the next morning
i just love everything about this product
definitely recommended it to all my friends!
really like this product!
this one has made me change my mind!
the formula makes my skin feel good
they just aren't as good as boscia
i really am liking this!
i really like this product.
this is just the right amount of hydration for me
i think the smell is decent, too.
dewiness that is hard to find in a spf
honestly my skin feels firmer
for some reason it left my skin feeling tough
i see a lot of comments about this having a bad smell
to be honest i don't really notice much of a smell
i love it i kinda almost wish it was a little more hydrating though
has no smell which i love because i hate strong smelled products that i put on my face
maybe one of the reasons my ski loves it so much
i definitely recommend it!
it has a natural feel that i really like.
love how nicely it goes on my face
i love the feel
i really like it because it gives me a long day moisture needed
i really like this moisturizer because it does not feel heavy at all
still has pretty good protection is always a plus
the spf is definitely a bonus
i like the feel of this
it feels really good on my skin
i love everything about this moistrurizer.
honestly, my face has never felt smoother.
really wish i went with my instinct
definitely recommend this one.
i feel like i don't have anything on my skin
i really liked it.
i would definitely recommend this product.
did not burn and the product has a nice texture.
i really like that it has spf
i really enjoy using the product.
have never found a moisturizer that has made my skin look so good so fast
i do not use primer as i feel too many layers just make me so greasy
this moisturizer is one of the very few that does not give me breakouts
that says it all.
have been able to tell that my face feels moist
i tried this in-store on the back of my very hard-working h
i love that you're paying good money
especially when this stuff goes a long way to begin with
i felt like my skin was starting to feel old
its really really a good combo.
i really like this product
i really like this moisturizer.
i cant find anything better in any price range because the texture is so amazing
i've always been a fan of nars in terms of color
they worked well for awhile
i really like this.
my skin never once felt tight or uncomfortable even though this was the only hydrating step i used
when i wake up my skin feels amazing
it works for me
i gave it 4 stars because there's always room for improvement
will definitely try others
said she needed to add a good amount of moisturizer because my skin felt really "dry"
she said "now feel your skin"
i do know it makes my skin
i keep getting compliment
yes they are great
i tell everyone about this nars line because i am a walking testimony as to how fab these products really are
i love this because i can feel the moisture in my skin all day
this stuff does the job
my main concern was that it would break me out as i have quite oily
i'd tried a sample of it quite awhile ago
i feel like this may not become a staple product for me
to make sure it is a good fit for you before shelling out the money
it has really helped my face
feel a difference in your skin
it really brings my skin back about 5 years
i love this stuff for helping meblend in my spf in the am
what i love the most about it is that with just a little you can feel the difference in your skin
this stuff makes my skin feel happy
my skin was everything that i've ever wanted.
also do a bunch of other things
this stuff is seriously amazing.
i look forward to it every day because it just makes my skin feel so good
i feel like it helps even my skin out quite nicely
i love trying new products constantly its hard for me to stick to something unless i love it
this stuff is magic: i mix 2 drops with my am
then i also wanted to try out josie maran's argan oil because i heard/ read a lot of good reviews about it as well
i feel like it's helping reduce my acne marks as well
this product is every.thing.
it is just so pretty!
this oil does not feel greasy what-so-ever which really amazes me
i really loved it.
not only does it have a very pleasant smell
i always wanted to purchase a nice face oil from sephora
i feel like it evens my skin tone
2-3 drops is truly all you need.
makes me skin feel smooth all day long
it had such a weird smell
just 2-3 drops makes my face feels very nice
i really love this oil.
which leads to my makeup not staying very well
it also doesn't smell very nice.
i really do like the effect it has on my skin
i definitely recommend this product!
my skin is really loving it
i am now obsessed with all things boscia.
i really like this product.
it has really helped my skin feel softer
the scent really helps me relax
i would definitely recommend this product.
this stuff is a miracle product
now i swear this stuff is making me age backwards
my foundation now goes on like a dream
so the bottle really lasts
if i can feel them at all on my skin
this bottle is going to last me a really long time
just to show you how much i love this stuff
it was too hard on my skin
it makes it really hard for me to try products that will keep my skin looking young
my skin just feels
i think it's a great value for how little you actually have to use
it has really helped my rosacea
wanted to try something different
i just love this one
see how i like it
this seemed like a product for me
this absorbs well unlike some oils that feel like they sit on top of my skin
so basically my skin is a mess.
this product tho - helped tremendously.
great hydration and does not break me out at all.
you get a lot of product
this oil has been very good to me.
if that makes sense
i really love this product
it's a pretty big bottle
this stuff actually works, and it smells amazing.
my skin used to be really.... weird.
running around after kids all day makes me pretty oily in my opinion
if your thinking about getting this just get it.
i could always use it on clients for dewy looks
i really like the way the oil feels on my skin.
i really like this cleanser: it is thick
like to try different things
so now my skin
i love it i will always buy this one
it always take a my makeup off
i need very little product to get the job done
i also like the smell too
'm doing good to my skin
would definitely recommend it to friends
use a little bit of water with it to really get it to foam
i really do think it helps with my fine lines that i was starting to see
this has made me feel otherwise
except it was kind of hard to wash off
i really really like it.
after using i love the way a little bit turned into a happy foamy good smelling treat for my face
it feels so nice on the skin and absorbs quickly.
i really look forward to moisturising my face right now since it feels so nice on the skin
love the feeling it leaves on my skin
does not look good under makeup
can make sure i always use the right amount
this really felt like it repaired my alligator h
this stuff is was so nice
does a pretty good job against winter dryness too
i loved the way i felt
which me personally quite enjoy
especially the turn-out of my foundation
i really love this product.
so always need makeup
this product is definitely doing the job of helping me achieve nice
i also really like the fragrance
it's always a good comment
if that makes sense
i learned that the hard way
it was just the feeling of it
it just feels so lovely to apply it
that being said, it is a really nice gel lotion.
i will continue to use this product because i think it works very well
i am really liking the way this product quickly absorbs into my skin
it really does feel soothing on my face
it leaves me looking
i did not think that it would be very hydrating because it is so light
this definitely fits the bill
feel really good going on
that's how it feels when it goes on
it felt like water when applying
i don't think i could find anything more wonderful for my face
i really want to love this product
my skin felt a lot smoother
i really don't like that
i swear my skin has never felt or looked better
this one is really a good buy
this one is definitely a keeper
i love how my skin feels after this goes on
i love fresh products, they never disappoint me.
it has to be pretty awesome in order for me to write it
it gets a a++++ from me.
i could not believe how amazing my skin looked
i really feel like its benefiting my skin
i never trusted gel mositurizers as i've always felt they are too light to provide good mositure
they work together in a really light
the only negative is that i feel like i have to apply a lot to cove my whole face
it always did the job
i really like how there is basically no scent from this product
is really prepared for make up
i still love it
the only bad thing i think i can say about it is it smells a little strange
i really love the scent
this really is doing a great job for me
i really love it
mentally the gel takes getting used to if you are accustomed to st
makes your skin feel great all day
my face really does feel perfect now.
you really do see improved moisture overall
it makes me skin feel very balanced.
i really like it and it foams up really well.
i would definitely recommend this product.
this stuff works wonders on my face.
i love the way my skin feels after
it really isn't strong enough for that
i definitely recommend this product.
would definitely recommend it.
my face felt really smooth
it feels really clean
your skin will definitely improve
i would definitely recommend it to others.
this leaves my skin feeling sooooo good
i let the makeup artist know what i have noticed about my skin
what really made me happy was the smooth feel of the foam
even my husband said the same thing.
if that makes sense
i can tell a big difference in just a week.
this stuff is magic.
i am so in love with this product!
it really does what it says.
i can deal with that as long as it keeps making my skin feel like this
which i quite like because my skin still feels plump
i know a lot of people have complained about the smell
who cares about the smell.
you are getting a beautiful natural product that you can feel confident in putting on your skin
and i even got one as a gift for my mom as well.
as i do personally find it a bit too oily for day time use
if you feel dull during the winter
first impression is that it smells awesome however if you apply it wrong it does leave a nice tint of orange on your face because it is so orange
i think a big thing about oils is the way you apply it
this stuff worked miracles in one day.
i really like this!
love the way it feels on my lips too.
am always on the search for products that leave my skin looking very dewy
this does the job very well!
even on my light skin i feel like it looks more glowy
feel that it does a good job
amazing stuff, really worth a try.
i feel like my skin gets better each day i use it
my skin would look really clear in the morning
10 times out of 10 at least one person will tell me how nice my skin looks
i wasn't expecting to like this product just because i'm really picky
i love the way this oil makes my skin look
i actually like the way it smells!
it really helped with my scaring issues
it's worked really well for that too
i definitely recommend using it before bed so that you wake up to a great canvas for makeup
this product is amazing just like all the other ones of this br
really like this product.
i am really enjoying using this
i know "pretty scent" is big for some
that said if you know anything about rose hip its definitely earthy to say the least
my skin looked so good clean that i almost wanted to return all my make-up
like others have stated this oil is definitely orange
whatever else they added really worked for my skin because i wake up with seriously smooth
i live in a town with terribly hard water
because it helps with everything
plus i'm in my late 20s so hey the stuff in this is helping my wrinkles that are just beginning
basically looked like a terrible sun burn.
so basically this is for anyone who has dryness
saving you guys some money here if you like both :
the smell i know is a big problem for people
are still good for you
it's nice to have a product that is clearly naturally based
adapt enough to a new skincare product before you can truly decide if it's a good fit
still felt like my skin was missing something
but i still love it!
i always loved this cream
at first the smell is a bit weird
honestly this product is magic for me.
this is it for me.
on the downside, it really does not smell good.
you never really get used to the scent
nothing was working the way i wanted it to
this is the stuff
which is definitely enough
it actually works well with my foundation that i use
certainly,i would recommend it to a friend.
thought it's time i start taking better care of my skin
definitely would recommend this.
how my skin was looking
he said my skin looked great
i love that 1/2 a pump is enough for both eyes.
definitely a night-time only cream
doing this made my eye area feel very slick
many things feel as if they are laying on my skin
it sure feels good
making my under eye area feel great
something that goes on this well has to be doing something right
could give this a really good honest try
i will definitely look into the shiseido br
there is definitely a difference
my mom taught us to take care of our skin around 18 on
ill admit people always seem to think im younger then my age
i also really like the consistency of this cream
i take good care of my eyes
love the way it makes my eyes feel and look.
it's nice to not see dark circles as the most prominent look on my face when i look into the mirror
feel like i literally tried everything-- this is the only thing so far that's helped
definitely see an improvement
this really helps smooth the fine lines around my eyes
i really like the texture so smooth
see a difference with just one use
who cares if it smells bad
the other results are so nice that i might consider it
definitely need a moisturizer with it.
they loved it too
i got this thinking it was the same thing
especially for literally just having a baby
'm gonna knock off one star
makes me look like i just got back from vacation
i definitely think this product is good for your skin
how it felt on my skin
i get compliments on my skin now
really even out my skin tone
it really is a miracle to me!
you will feel your skin gets tight after you apply this
you feel the difference
i truly wanted to hate this thing.
"dark" lately so given the good reviews i decided to give this serum a try
thought "jeez i look pleasantly different for some reason
so my lady who does my facials said to get this!
i feel that it also helps to balance
i did feel like i got some benefit from the formula 15
this is the only one that my skin loves
i know that i look good in the morning
my skine just looks so great with the use of this
i am a man who really wants to stay younger looking
s so amazing that i can ever use it under my eyes
i feel like it really does perk up my skin
my daughter really likes it
giving my honest opinion
i honestly feel like it provides so much moisture to my very dry skin
i really love this!!!
make your skin look more awake i didn't feel like i got the boost i was expecting
i do believe that that was do more towards its amazing scent i did feel that it left my skin very shiny it had a wet look the didn't really fade out that was slightly disappointing
it always leaves my face feeling cool
especially to take with me on the go for when my face needs a little pick me up
i like it a lot
it is one thing i look for in something thats going to be all over my face
it doesnt feel like i have a 'mask' on like some others make my face feel
i really love that it has this front smell of citrus that has this refreshing property
i really like this whole line
i would definitely purchase
i really like this product
it really does wake you right up!
i really love this moisturizer.
i feel very refreshing after applying it.
which is always what i look for in a moisturizer
i love this product because it feels so light on my skin
honestly everything in this line
never really got the results that i wanted
pretty much every moisturizer ever has made me break out
makes my skin feel good
i really like this moisturizer
i also love how it tingles.
it's actually a very good moisturizer for all skin types
it can be awful trying to find one moisutrizer for my whole face
i really like this one
knew i was going to love the ginzing products
what i like most about this is that it didn't make me feel like as if i was just putting on lotion to my face
after using this gel mousterizer it not only hidrates my skin super good
love the way it makes my skin feel
i feel like it wakes me
i think the gel makes all the difference.
it really perks me up in the morning when i use it
this is so lightweight it feels like i have nothing on
i would definitely recommend this product!
it never felt harsh on my skin
it makes me feel so clean
yet it makes my skins feel so good
i really recommend it
it not only feels great on my skin
so i was so surprised when i used this stuff!
it has a very nice substance too it
immediately feels plumping which is not something i've ever really thought about a moisturizer
i would definitely recommend for anyone to try out since it seems like it would work for a variety of skin types
all opinions are my own obviously!
i am pretty sure that i've bought every br
it is definitely not overpowering
i really like this moisturizer.
ever since i started using it i can feel
another thing i love is that it dosen't leave your face feeling greasy
i really really enjoy this moisturizer!
makes my skin feel so
i really liked using this moisturizer.
i love the way my skin feels
it gives you a cool feeling when you put it on
which i love, especially in the morning.
'm always on the search for something that can help rejuvenate
i absolutely recommended this product for those who want to try something different
this stuff works miracles!
it makes my face feel great
before he knew the name of it he said it has a certain zing to it
the truth i have presented a wonderful change since i do not feel heavy
i feel like this has helped
honestly feels like magic
i really liked this moisturizer.
definitely wakes you up
the price point is great for what you get too!
i the smell definitely wakes me up
overall, i really like it!
i really like this moisturizer.
the fact that it's a gel moisturizer is actually really nice
my only complaint is that i thought it would have more of a tingly feeling to help "wake up" my skin
i love the almost gel-like consistency
the smell is just right, not overwhelming.
i think this would be good for all skin types
i really love this moisturizer!
this whole skin care line definitely wakes you up
liked how light weight this was on my face
it definitely does any sacrifice anything in the hydration department
i wasn't so sure about the gel at first
i would definitely recommend it!!
it is very light weight actually feels like water
i've actually seen an improvement with my skin i absolutely love this stuff i will repurchase when i'm out
ok i'll come right out
i can honestly say i genuinely love this gel moisturizer
it helps me wake up and feel energized.
even when i wash my face after a whole day i can feel it still on my skin keeping it moisturizer
my skin never felt oily afterwards which was great also
it smells so good ,just like oranges.
so appreciate that it doesn't feel heavy on my face at all
i love this product so much i feel like i need to
across my face because i love the way my skin feels
something i read in one of the reviews that i think makes a big difference is that i wait for my moisturizer to soak in a bit maybe 5-10 minutes then apply primer wait another 5 minutes until my face feels liked that absorbed
i really like the feeling of this primer
my skin loves me for it
i really love it
it wears very well under my make up too.
this is my go-to primer when i want my face to look flawless
good things to say about this primer
this product has made a real difference in how i look
i never look or feel "made up" or have any blending problems or cakiness like you can get with foundation
going to start by saying i have very oily skin
it made my aging skin look pretty darn good
i get told i look 25 all the time.
i definitely will be keeping this one a part of my routine
it makes my face look and feel like velvet.
this gives you really smooth
i definetly use it to give my make up an even surface
how it makes my skin feel
it's pretty close though.
my skin always improves when i use it
you truly get what you pay for
this works really well
this stuff has done wonders for my menopause wrecked skin in just 4 days
one pump is good enough for the whole face.
you get the feeling
after it dries creates a very nice even tone in order to put on your foundation makeup on top
i really hate my huge pores
this primer is amazing even tho i just noticed a little difference in my pore size it's still an amazing product
i also noticed that my makeup really lasted all day
this product truly does keep your makeup on
i wasn’t expecting a miracle… a lot of people think pores can actually shrink…guess what?
it really does make my face very smooth
feel there is something about the alguronic acid
t's good for your skin too
the pores are really gone
my make-up looked amazing on me
i do like it- goes on smooth
'm not sure how well this is doing as far as anti aging
i really liked it from the first day.
i don't think it does a lot to your skin as a whole
i would definitely look for alternatives
it does really work for my lines
sometimes i'm scared of trying new things bc of breaking out or my skin just not liking it
i read that many people swear by this for `lifting` everything up a bit
i loved everything about this
which is what i am really after.
just because it works like magic
needless to say my skin definitely shows the level of my stress
think that the retinol really is working today tighten
obviously the price is a big drawback
this type of product is definitely not in my budget

i feel like i've got my skin routine down
i think this product really takes a long time to finish off
i really enjoy using it in the mornings
since sephora has a really good policy for returning products i suggest you oily girls like me
i hope it works for you as good as it works for me
the best part of this oil is it smells soooo good
most of them do not smell good
pretty--i just love it
really changed my life!
so this must be good stuff
it definitely helps control the shine
i feel like i have different skin
however, it works really well.
my skin is so soft in the morning when i wake up that i really don't care what i look like at night

i think this is it
it has a bit of shimmer that looks really pretty
as a guy anything that is easy is appealing.
i really love it
i really like it
i am not sure it would be quite moisturizing enough for where i live by itself
i love the way it feels
nothing like this stuff.
it's especially hard finding one with a good texture
my go-to moisturizer --- love everything about it it
i never feel greasy
i feel great about protecting my skin every day
let me start out by explaining that i am extremely fair skinned
didnt like it as i felt it left me very shiny

now it looks like a baby skin
you can imagine my surprise when i put this on one morning to find that my skin was incredibly supple
was shopping for something that would really soak into my skin
makes my skin feel so incredibly good.
makes your skin look really good
can not say enough about the awesome change in the quality of my skin
i really like this product for an every day moisturizer
never stuck with it even though my fair skin really needs the sun protection
this is definitely one of them
which makes it feel super light
i really love this product
i liked the way my skin looked and felt.
i feel my face is smoother
to the extent that i don't feel comfortable putting it on my face
it works so well for me
make up goes on really well afterward
it feels like i am wearing nothing
i get many compliments when i wear it on how great my skin looks
it definitely took me several tries to get it right
and it really holds on to it.
i tried this and it really delivers!

this stuff is simply amazing.
i am often told i have great skin for my 60 years because i have few wrinkles
let me tell you guys that my skin has never felt this way before
it made my skin so lovely that i would just rock the no make up look all week
i never really used lancome products
the way it makes my skin feel
love this product and would definitely recommend.
it started to make my skin looks even
i definitely see a massive difference adding this into my skin care routine
i like this a lot
i can say that it has definitely helped with texture

ifeel my skin get well
this product is like crack to me

'm not sure how this works on aging skin
the sephora consultant really pushed this product on me
so i hope this review helps you as well.

i really love this product i saw a big difference in my skin after a couple uses
i feel like it did help minimize the appearance of my pores
my skin looked so good.
it made my skin feel
it is definitely a must have for me in my mask collection
it made my skin really smooth
felt very smooth after just one use
feel like i'm not wearing any after using this
it is absolutely amazing it worse it did not make my skin red
my pores are definitely gone after using this mask
not expecting much because i feel like masks
whatnot never really work for me
every time i think about it i'm going to be sad that it's not in my budget range right now
it felt nice like it was actually working
this stuff is seriously life changing
this seriously made it feel lielvet
after i used it my skin felt very smooth
i can truly feel
when i applied it, my skin was really tight.

putting it on was so weird
this mask really does work!
this stuff instantly works!!
i really love how clean this product is
you can feel it tighten on your face.
just honestly looks better
this is not a drill, you guys.
to be totally honest i feel like most of them don't do anything at all
would definitely recommend this product!
i swear there is just something about this that just makes me want to put this on my face almost everyday
here you get many treatments out of one jar!
this product definitely lives up to the hype!
i did not love the feel of the mask on my face as it was drying
i am definitely going to be purchasing this.
my face looks pretty much flawless
this one truly does what it says it does- reveals brighter skin after one use
i feel it works very nicely.
i've never had a product seem like it worked right away
this stuff seriously made a difference
this stuff worked like a charm
wanted to really like this product for the price
i will definitely be telling friends
i loved how it felt on the skin
it seemed like i could "feel it working" while it was drying
the only thing i didn't like was that it really takes some effort to get it completely rinsed off
my face feels really nice afterwards.
i really like it.
it does get a bit hard
i gotta say i really enjoyed it
i would definitely recommend for those with clear
also makes me feel better what is going into my skin
not hurt the environment
make me feel good
afterwards my skin felt amazing
'm always worried about trying something new
more of a mental "yay i'm being nice to my skin" feeling than an actual "wow my skin actually looks amazing" result
it instantly made my skin look better
can feel a difference in how those products absorb so well into my skin
nothing has ever made my skin look or feel more amazing
my skin is always glowing after i use it
i don't like things that are too hard on my face
when i use this 3 times a week it really helps to keep my breakouts at bay
i really love this
my skin is honestly glowing
i also saw that a lot of people have commented about the smell
makes me feel like my face is still clean when i wake up
it's really light and absorbs very nicely.
it absorbs really well
really liked this cleanser
it really makes your face brighten
really wanted to hate this because of the price
this stuff really works.
it smells sooooo good
does not leave me with any tight or uncomfortable feeling
others are just the right combo to do the job
i can definetly can see what kind of softness what other review talking about
my skin felt like exactly regenerate.
after one use i honestly noticed a difference
this stuff seriously is amazing, try it out.
made my skin feel
this is a great exfoliater that doesn't feel harsh on your skin
which when i use in the shower gets me a bit nervous
it simply feels great when i use it
smells so good too
the bottle is so pretty on my vanity
i love the way my skin looks
feels after i use it
i already feel a difference in my skin
just haven't gotten excited with any of the cleansers i've been using
use this cleanser my skin honestly looks better than it does with foundation on
i am so happy with this product i will try a few more tata harper products because i want to start using high-quality
so dealing with breakouts in my late 20's was something very new to me
the packaging is also really nice to look at on my counter
this is a skin care game changer for me
it's for sure going to be one of those things i make sure i always have an extra of in case i run out
we get our skin only once for the whole life plus what we use for our skin gets sinked it to our body
i love how this is so refreshing
how my skin feels
makes your skin feel so good
the price however is not my favorite definitely hurts a little to buy this product
now it's the first thing i want to do when i get home at night because this product just makes my skin feel so good
my only gripe with this product is that despite how beautiful it is
i really love the scent
i usually use it on the weekends- it definitely makes my skin 'glow'
i buy a lot of stuff
gets the job done
this stuff works wonders.
i love the way my skin feels so clean
feels really good when it is on your skin
i swear you can feel it working.
what i think makes it work so well is that is has a ph of 5
i really liked this cleanser a lot until a month or two into using it
too bad because they are really nice products.
if you use as directed you can really feel the enxymes doing their work
really notice a difference in my skin
it's nice to have products you feel so good about using
it helps me relax
i actually see a difference in how bright
it sounds like most people complaining got the sample
do feel a huge difference with this product
i really like this product
my skin loves this stuff
made such a difference that my esthetician wanted to know what i had done differently
you can actually feel it
this product really works!
my skin is really starting to show its age
s of skin products last year with any benefits that i started thinking that my skin won't look pretty any more
i always get told i look about 15 years younger than i am
this line has everything i want to give me a clean
i desperately wanted to love this product line
i always have tired eyes
i find myself reaching for this whenever i'm stressed or if my eyes just feel tired
the reason i am giving this 4/5 stars is because i can't always tell a difference in the puffiness in my eyes
it does have a really nice cooling sensation when applied
not sure if it works so well with puffiness though
this product really works!
gistthis such a nice product that you can use anytime
seem to always feel tired so this is such a great product for me
it feels like a treat for my eyes
i will say it does feel good
it really is a life saver
my eyes really look horrible
it makes my tired eyes
works great if you apply it right
this is definitely a long term thing
this is definitely a keeper for me
i can't believe it took me so long to find such a great gel
it works just as good without keeping it that cold
this feels so good below the eyes
it feels really good on the eyes
works really well, i would recommend.
i love how my skin looks now
he knows his stuff
it has a water like feel
i feel like it doesn't give me that moisture that i desperately need this winter
it feels really nice and is not oily.
i really enjoy using this cleanser.
i love how it feels when i apply it on my face
i will definitely keep using it!
it does feel cooling when applied which is nice.
it has visibly improved my skin tone overall to the point where i can totally go with no foundation if i want to
it still feels nice against the skin
i feel very clean after using this.
something no other cleanser has done for me
yet it still gets my skin really clean
can't tell you how wonderful this stuff is i will use it forever
definitely feel that it has brightened my skin tone
it still feels good
i am pretty have with the product
this works for me.
i definitely recommend this product
good for everything else
it is great for me in the summer when i don't want to look oily
my skin has honestly never looked better
do very good clean job
i love how amazing it makes my skin feel
how my skin looks so pretty
that really let you try the product
this bad boy goes to work
the feel is nice and i love the dropper.
i never feel greasy
in the summer time i notice it really brightens my face
just makes it feel balanced
says he "feels young again"
i don't like the way that feels
i am really digging this stuff.
im still getting compliments on my skin
it sure feels good
i really love the way it feels on my skin
but has a great feel and i use it twice daily.
i guess we will be getting younger now.
i just basically looked horrible without makeup
which seemed crazy to me like it would make my acne worse
i especially like patting this over my face
i feel like it lives up to its claims.
it did not feel greasy at all
he thought i'd gone crazy
we both just giggled like lunatics about how soft it was
pretty amazing to put oil on your face
it really does make my skin look
they said i looked very radiant without knowing my secret
i really like this!
my skin loves this oil and i do too!
truly love how well skin looks/feels after use.
nothing seems to really work
let me start off by saying i am not a huge fan of oils
love the feel and performance of this product.
definitely love the way my skin looks since i started using this product
i am really enjoying this oil.
in my entire life of beauty products i have never ever found something that has worked as good as this
feel so smooth each morning
i feel like i have younger
what i like about this is that it really does make my skin look better
the way it felt
going to get some for my mom
my skin also just loves this stuff.
it is definitely light enough to wear during day if you wanted
i've never had awfully bad acne
i feel that it has made a huge diff in my complexion
i can definitely see a difference in my skin.
since i'm using this oil i feel my face smooth
i really like it.
well-thought-out product that truly delivers
i must say that it is very nice
this has really added to my serum's reduction of my lines
when you are a very oily person like myself extra oil is not anything that you want from a product
pulls everything together to feel healthier.
my skin looks sooooo good since i started using this
i feel personally that this is one of the few that really did the job
i truly believe this bottle helped me staying younger as age 43
this works wonders for me
my skin needs a lot of help
just keeps working every time
i feel like it really helps with radiance
it always worked wonders
it looks like my skin is clear
best if suited for your skin-obviously
have to really watch which products i use
really love this product
look amazing if i forget it one night my skin lots dull definitely a must try
my skin feels and looks soooo good.
i feels it has help with skin my issues though.
i really believe it actually helped the collagen production to fill in my scars
i can definitely notice the difference in moisture
this product makes my skin look radiant that i am now confident to go out without putting on some make up
i believe that it has kept my skin looking beautiful
you can really use it night
we all have pretty good skin
there just really is nothing like it
my face does not look as good
obviously it's not just the serum
i really enjoy it
it also feels nice to do something for myself at the end of a long day taking care of a baby
literally the whole feel of my face
it really makes a big difference in my skin tone
i get compliments on how good my skin looks
you have to use it for quite some time before you see a difference
i can truly tell the difference in my skins moisture
i love that it is so light and refreshing.
i definitely recommend it!
i know everyone's skin is different
this stuff has changed my skin already
this is a pain i'll be glad to splurge on
i would say that this product is really good
honestly when i wake up in the morning my skin looks totally refreshed
to say my skin is a challenge is an understatement
i feel it has helped clear everything up
my skin looked even
asked what i was doing differently
he said how pretty i looked
good things to say about it
my coworker who is picky about pretty much everything everything told me she uses this one
this product really helps to clear them up
i am sure that it makes my face feel amazing
let me start by saying that i have some really messed up skin
well, it has truly changed my skin.
i felt like i had to
yes its tacky but it feels nice.
it goes on so nice isn't greasy at all.
i can always tell the difference when i forget to put this product on under my foundation
it feels and works like a primer!
it makes my skin look so flawless
you found it right here
i can really see a difference in my fine lines
its name says "perfectionist" and it truly is!
have found it here
always come back to estée lauder's perfectionist
it really helped to even out my skin tone
i will definitely keep using.
you will really love this product
i look pretty good for such an old gal
i think this helps
i guess i am an older woman now so here i am
work really good for me!
i feel terrible for the peoples who's pores are not minimized by this product bc mine sure have which is great bc countless high end serums
my skin always looks
trust me they were big
knew that it was making my skin feel smoother
i really love this product!
really does make a huge difference over time
makes my skin feel amazing
and i love the way my face feels and look now.
i can now feel a nicer texture to my skin.
i used the whole thing up
i realized just how much this thing had helped me
i am now a big estee lauder fan.
feels nice without being too heavy
said to myself lets go back to the basics
gets really greasy looking by the end of the day
i think it's pretty decent for my type of skin
day wear feels nice once you put it on
maybe it's just because of my weird skin
it gave my face such a healthy glow that i didn't think my skin was capable of having with out looking greasy
i like the way my skin looks
my skin felt good while i used it
definitely see/feel a difference in the brightness
i really like this product
it feels greasy going on -- in a good way!
love how it makes my skin feel
this is definitely not for you
i know, it says "oil free", well, maybe.
it's working very well for me
i should also mention that because i apply quite a bit of this it does feel heavy
it really seems to always be the right weight all year long throughout all four seasons in the northeast
i really love this one!
i really love this moisturizer
i get compliments on how my face looks for my age
always come back to this moisturizer
it goes on pretty smooth
before that i was using nars which wasn't very good experience
you guys this stuff is amazing!
my skin tone has never looked so good
it's definitely been bothering me
it makes me look tired all the time
i am not getting old, just my skin.
okay maybe we both are
maybe if i drink this stuff i can slow down the whole process
you can feel a nice tingle
great stuff i will also use it in the pm before i go to bed with my other skin care
i never really cared for an oil until my skin was getting really dry
always keeps my skin clear.
smells really good too.
i feel so fresh every time after i use it.
is this really doing anything?
you want something that feels amazing
you just have to be sure that you let the serum soak in really good
you will feel less bags every time you use it
my mom love it very much!
it feels sooo good.
but especially around my eyes.
seems to feel even better with this stuff underneath
it just felt like a cream
it goes on like
i love it because it really works to take away the dark circles under my eyes
i can truly see a difference when i am using this one
used it every night i'd be doing pretty well in fighting the looks of aging
because i can still feel a little tension every time after i apply it
it definitely gave me a refreshed look in my eye area
i don't really battle under eye circles
i really love this.
i do think that this helps me look a bit younger than i am
dark circles are not really an issue for me
i definitely recommend this product!
it feels so good when you use it
no one else really makes a cleanser with that consistency
thought what the heck
i mean really careful
i will say that i have pretty normal skin
am not sure how it would work with difficult skin
it works very well at getting all makeup off
i love iti even feel that this has helped my dark spots a little as well
using it as a mask twice a week is good because it really tightens your pores
you know its good
i know many people love the smell of our
my skin really did look better even after just one wash
that it was ok

this makes my skin look so great that lately i've been going without

keeps my skin from doing
my skin has never looked so great!

i always recommend it to everyone

i feel like this stuff provides the same level of moisture
i wanted to let everyone know that this moisturizer is great
it is definitely light enough to work during the day
i find myself wearing less makeup since starting this product
my laugh lines are still the same.
not sure how the natural ones work
my skin is telling me i am getting older:
i need a good amount for skin to feel really clean
this has done wonders for my skin.
this stuff is so light
this really works to take it off
i really recommend it
great when im too tired
i really think this is the one underneath it all
i think this product
taking off mascara has always been a challenge for me
i tried this micellar water out because the one i was using seemed to be hurting my face lately
i like it a lot!
i love how it makes my skin feel.
water to make sure i got all the soap
love the way these products make my skin look
works ok but the smell is weird so 2 stars off.
my skins feels and look very nice.
it's amazing what comes off my face with this stuff
i love it a lot not just for removing makeup
maybe my skin isn't getting the care it needs
sometimes at the end of the day i'll use this to feel clean when i don't want to start my whole routine
this is obviously getting pricey: eyemakeup wipe
how my skin feels after use
i am so happy i found this product because i was worried about causing wrinkles with all the rubbing i had to do to get my makeup off with other products
love that this stuff really does take off makeup.
when i am done my skin feels brighter
i surely have heard all kinds of wonderful things about micellar water over the course of the past year
everything he touches pretty much turns to gold
leaves skin feeling really really clean and pure.
the smell bothers me so much
:) i will definitely keep buying it :)
its really does make your skin feel soft however i dont think it completely takes off all the makeup
i definitely do not need soap
it feels just like you're using water.
always give me a rash
it even does a good job on eye makeup
this is really great when i'm tired
i really like it
don't do a good job on eye makeup
i love the way it feels and smells.
this gets the job done
this is the only thing that works for me
really don't care for the smell.
for the price it needs to wow me.
just generally not taking good care of myself
i honestly love the way my skin feels after
i like the smell, feels good after i wash if off
especially since i feel like a lot of “moisturizing” products just don’t do the job
this one really does!
the first thing you notice about this product is obviously the price
i can definitely tell the difference in the way my makeup applies
ever time i use this mask it leaves my face feeling truly amazing
for me it was okay
it really helps the recovery
'm starting see lines on my skin
waiting to see how i feel
it felt weird--that it didn't feel like it completely rinsed off when using only water
since i know all the good the product does
the texture was also great not sticky like i though it would be
really wanted to try this
skin care was never something i obsessed over
i feel like something is missing
this is a great lotion, don't get me wrong!
this was the first moisturizer to really give me what i needed for oil control
somehow i always come back to this product for my very sensitive skin
decided to splurge a little on this product since it had pretty good ratings
definitely a staple in my skin care routine
for sooo many years then it just stopped working for me
i feel like if you have dry skin this would be good
i've heard so many amazing things about this moisturizer
this is the all around moisturizer i always come back to
i wanted a good moisturizer that didn't feel heavy on the skin
almost daily just when i feel like i need a little moisture
definitely a must have product for me.
this worked soooo great for my skin.
've come to the conclusion that this product only works well in a duo with the pink stuff
great moisturizer, i just wish it had spf!
this moistrizer saves me everyday no matter what the occasion
it does feel pretty bare-bones
i'd definitely recommend this one
this is the only thing that has helped my skin
i feel it really hydrates well
so while in store an employee told me that it would be amazing if i layered over this because it's know as the "moisture gps"
it spreads out really well
love the way my skin feels after i use
i want to try the gel formula because i've read that that works better for everyday use
it doesnt make me breakout
does a really good job
here i am it turns out that this clinique classic does it all
it really does make any face makeup look flawless
my skin feels so good
i actually do see a positive difference when i use this
this stuff works miracles
my make up looks horrible unless i use this
my skin drinks this stuff up in a good way
you get a lot for $14
people tell me i look like i am in my twenties
it definitely brightens my under eye area
i love the feel of it when i put it on
this product has done very well for me
i find that i always get puffy
always look super tired in the morning
it's so nice to use it in the morning.
my dark circles are definitely a challenge for me
i feel like this is relieving some of the darkness there as well
personally, i love everything shisiedo makes!
i like the light feel
it makes my skin look so clear
after using for couple weeks i can say that the product is really hydrating
i really love this product.
i am quite happy with how well it takes away the puffiness from under my eyes
what i love about it is the fact that it dries up so fast
which i really need
overall i liked this moisturizer-- nothing mind blowing
so just covers me enough during my commute
my skin still looked amazing without it.
this product makes my skin look beautiful even if i choose not to wear makeup at all
i spent years without properly taking care of my skin because the results i wanted were always iffy
it would always break me out
it feels really fresh
realized why i had been getting unusually large compliments on my skin: that sunscreen by shiseido really did something amazing
i always find myself touching my cheeks afterwards cause they feel so nice
i am pretty fair
it is really light to the touch
i love that it is so light
it's always worked for me
i do like it a lot.
my face is definitely smooth
i wanted something to minimize my pores because that was all i really had to complain about
after he kissed me he said "oh my gosh you smell sooooo good
i feel like i made the right decision
i really love this moisturizer.
it smells so good too!
overall i feel it does the job really well for my oily bits
i would have given it 5 stars if it worked as well for my cheeks
i really like this product.
one pump is enough for my whole face and neck.
i quite like it
you can feel the magic happening
i feel amazing after applying it every morning
i really like how light
i can even see the huge difference it makes
i really like the smell of this product line~
this product really gives me that chance.
so don't feel obligated to purchase the whole line just to get good results
it just seems like they used some really cheap plastic
liked how it felt on my skin
i really wanted to get this for almost a year.
my skin never really became beautiful as in my 20s
makes me skin look even
it does what it is supposed to do with very little to start
love everything about it.
this has done wonders to my face
gives me just the right amount of hydration
i definitely recommend giving this a shot
i could really feel the difference in my skin
lets start with things that i like about it
it hasn't really helped with my acne
it was definitely a help to my skin
i think this product really works
that being said, here are my results:
i love the way my skin is looking
i will definitely recommend this product for all skin type
it definitely evens out my skin tone
have my skin look as good as it did when i would wear a full coverage foundation
after a few uses i was still sure if liked it.
i would always have 1
this stuff really works.
i almost dread putting it on because they do not make my face feel nice at all
there are no bumps my skin looks amazing i feel like myself again
which is very distressing because my job requires me to wear a lot of make up
i felt like they worked okay
they definitely burn when you use them
to me that makes me feel like they are really working
am sure they work for me
it made my face feel a lot softer
things are so clear
this product is truly a lesson in "beauty is pain
it was because the product was really getting down into my pores
my skin has cleared up tremendously .
nothing was healing it all the way
beware it really does feel super itchy when you use it
about 6-7 months ago my skin started breaking out like crazy for who knows what reason
lol they really are great.
my face does feel tight
my skin can take a beating so they're great for me
you can really see an improvement on your skin after a couple of uses
stuff you have on your face
the only reason i am giving this product 4/5 stars is because i would have liked to see the product take care of redness
this is what works for me
i love this it really works you can se the difference so quickly
these pads really work.
i feel like it has somewhat helped my skin in terms of tone
your skin will thank you for it.
so what i did was i added a moisturizer right away
i also think it's helping with old scars as well
it's been really bad lately
yeah these burn a little
they really clear up your acne very well
my skin started freaking out on me
this was definitely the root on my acne
they are definitely fading.
this stuff works wonders
chest feel every time i apply it
i can get over that my skin looks great n clear :
quite honestly have cleared my skin beyond belief
it's not like a nice tingle
you gotta' feel the burn to get the benefits
imagine ditching your foundation because your skin looks that good
not sure how good these pads would work on their own on acne
this product has definitely improved everything about my skin 110%
this is the only stuff that works for me
it really is helping clear my face!
now my skin is starting to feel smooth
your skin will tough it out
which tells me the product is doing its thing
they don't smell so bad right our of the package
everything he creates just works so well for me
i just love him *sigh* :)
be sure to put your eye cream on first because if you touch these pads then touch your eye it won't be fun
i feel like these do a better job than the peels do
tried just about everything
sounds like they don't work for everyone
they have really helped me
my skin has never looked so clear
at first these feel refreshing
this product definitely seems to have a good effect
they really do work
they really do work
this stuff really freakin stings.
i'll give these 4 stars because they're definitely potent
i can honestly see an improvement in my skin clarity
they really really work
it is really working for me
sure there is a bit of a burning sensation
i really like this product.
i feel like the salicylic acid is really getting down into my pores
i always find myself breaking out to other products
i find it especially great for when i want to use a face mask while getting things done around the house
obviously anything will wipe off your face if you go to bed
it feels so refreshing
angry skin will love this as it feels cool the second it touches the skin
that's a great way to see how dehydrated your skin may be
i definitely recommend this mask.
this mask makes my skin feel amazing in the morning
i really hope they start to do some research of skin care
it does what it is meant to do very well
did a very good job in hydration
it's a great way to give your self some me time.
really working the product into my skin
because not only it removes your make up good
this product definitely does the trick
everyone has been asking me what i've been doing to my skin
its pretty good at taking makeup off
i happen to enjoy them
honestly changed my skin
my skin has never looked or felt better.
i gave 4 stars because the smell is just okay.
i wish it smelled better.
i read somewhere that it works great with clarisonic brushes
let me just tell you, it totally worth it.
yeah that's what this smells like.
while i do love the way it makes my skin feel
if you're really on a super saver budget,
makes my skin feel amazing
i could feel my face was a bit firmer
however, i don't really enjoy the smell.
when i do i always feel like i've just had a facial
i find myself reaching for it everyday
it has worked very well for me.
i feel like i've tried every cleanser on the market
which i think is cool
i like to use it when i have to wear a lot of make up
i wish i just went with my instincts
i honestly look forward to washing my face now.
you really need to congratulate your marketing team
i loved the way it smelled & how it made me feel.
really want to try some more eve lom products
this stuff is different
definitley not for everyone
this stuff goes on to dryskin
my skin has never looked so good!
really want to get the job whose makeup i was washing off
my skin felt so smooth not just immediately
loved what it did for my skin
it's very pricy i think i'll buy it in the future for sure
i must say that it's the only thing that's ever made my skin feel so nice
'm not really disappointed that it's not the greatest eye cream/serum
the only downfall to this seriously cool
i am on this guy
this cleanser feels so great when you rub it on your skin
your skin will feel so amazing afterwards
i seriously feel as if i could go without moisturizer
believe me i have tried a lot
it really works not just for spots
i read a lot of great things about the dynaspot
it's given me very good results!
great purchase for those of us still getting breakouts in their 30's
my skin still breaks out with those things that i mentioned
what makes this product so great for me especially is that when i do use it all over
it just feels normal which is so hard to accomplish with a clay-like mask
my skin felt amazing afterward.
it smells bad for sure
the smell made me think
i personally like the smell.
i personally like the 1
it really does rescue my skin.
this one really works in 15 min
so for me to call a tingle refreshing is no small thing
i don't want to even put on my moisturizer that is how great my skin feels
i really like this one
it feels so good to apply
that's not how i want my face to feel in the morning
i really noticed a difference when i applied my foundation
for me i use it everyday
i like the scent quite a bit
leave it feeling tight like a lot of others i've used
it is something that i look forward to
leaves your face feeling so good
the smell is different but i actually like it!
this cleanser is pretty darn good if you ask me.
it takes off your makeup very well
i love everything about it
i do feel that it's best on morning skin
kinda love at the same time
i personally like the smell.
i can already see a difference in the way my skin feels
i love how this cleanser makes my skin feel
you will see something is really happening on your face
really does the job
this stuff is pretty much life-changing
i get compliments all the time
people are always asking what i do to make my skin glow
very nice base for makeup or wear alone.
i really wanted to love this product
i really want something to work
this stuff truly is something worth trying for a couple weeks
my skin has never looked so good.
i would say i am definitely a fan of this line
i am finding myself wearing way less makeup
i as well as others here got a pump that was not working
i really like the scent
i wanted something that would give me my glow back
this has really changed my skin
i would say i am definitely a fan of this line
i am finding myself wearing way less makeup
have always looked a bit young
i can barely see it if i look really hard where it was
i got so many comments on my face looking smooth
nice tone that i wanted to go home
know you're not going to get a lot of sleep
this stuff is just too good
people always comment on my complexion
i can certainly tell the difference in my makeup application
i guess it has a pleasant smell
one said 'what's going on with you skin?
this stuff is the real deal
love this by the way!
this stuff really does smooth out those "i'm 47 lines"
my eyes looked and felt tired all the time.
my eyes rarely feel as tired as they used to
this stuff burned a bit when i put it on
was thinking maybe trying something new
you got to try this combination.
fine lines never looked so smooth
ok i'm not sure what is working because i'm using this plus algenist firming
i can tell you this or this combo has done amazing things
this stuff is so good i had begun to take it for granted
i really think this makes a big difference in hydration
my skin looks so good from using the eye cream
i like trying different things
i do like it so far i do feel like it depuffs my eyes in the morning
i think what people need to realize is no product is going to completely take away under eye bags
this one is the first eye serum ever that makes me feel surprised
this is the only one that makes me feel it's actually useful
now i know why they were so excited this stuff is great
i love that you can feel it working.
you can feel it doing it's job
you'll start to see great results
after one use this really improved.
you will definitely see results.
i still see results so there really must be something to the claim that retinoate is uv-stable
it is working for me
i do feel that i am starting to see results as well
really feels thick enough to where i know it's protecting me
really love this cream
so there is a lot of stuff going on my skin every day
my eyes really look better with this.
i really wanted an eye cream with spf
it definitely did its job
definitely not a big deal though.
i feel like they drag along my skin
that's not good for the skin around that area
i really like this eye cream because it has spf
frankly i had never really heard of it
really liked the consistency of this eye cream.
i realized my skin is really smooth
ok, so i have mixed feelings about this product.
because it did work well for me
thought i would need tone one because i am so fair
i love how it helps even my skin tone
i only use a bottle beginning of each year when i feel like winter has made my skin dull
i can say all my dark spots are basically gone
to give you an idea of how bad it was
loved how it made my skin feel
i like to splurge when it comes to keeping my skin pretty :
well i didn't it is all my good skin care.
since i know it works i bit the bullet
love it the way it works on my skin.
i love this stuff so, so much.
my skin indeed looked flawless after using it.
it worked really well with my acne spots to
wanted everyone to know that tone 1 is for the fair skin individuals
so needless to say i'm pretty hesitant when trying new products
i would really like to know what the light/medium/dark means
i really like this.
just wanna to say it is amazing product that is definitely work
they really help this treatment to sink in
everyone says only i see it
this stuff is the the bomb.
i can definitely see a difference
when i am done all i need to do is just twist the head
all these together give me clear
because i used to have really bad acne
it works for me
i always thought i had dull skin
thats what is so great about sephora
i really love this product
this product really works
it is important that you go for the tone that is right for your face
this product has definitely made me a believer!
it also really helps the texture of my skin
i can feel it working
love how my face feels from this.
you don't use the whole thing right away
my skin loves this stuff.
obviously you get what you pay for
these resurgence products have really made a difference
always make sure to keep a product for that amount of time to really see if it works for me
i can really see a difference in my skin
we all know sephora's return policy is amazing.
so you really have nothing to lose.
it really does help the breakouts
it is definitely greasy.
this cream seems to balance everything out
my skin feels good on the outside.
look just as good too
feel great and doesn't feel greasy.
its pretty good i use it every night.
i gave this cream four stars because i think it's a good cream
i like the way my skin feels with this.
i really like this skin care system
for someone like me who has combination skin
it makes my skin feel so good
am always afraid to try new products
i find this cleanser really helps my skin look
i like this murad cleanser seems to do a good job while using the clarisonic
all of my friends have gotten hooked on this since i started getting such great-looking skin
i think it's a good choice for winter.
it is especially good at removing make-up
it does a very good job of removing makeup.
fine lines even thought i am still young
love the way this makes my skin feel.
i figured all their other products would be just as good
i really feel like i get a deep cleansing whenever i use it
it really gets my face clean
definitely recommend to anyone looking to restore moisture
it helped me clear out my pimples as well.
love the whole line of murad resurgence skin care
so i thought i had combination skin.
i always come back because there is just nothing better
never makes me feel dry
i really love this cleanser.
you get a lot of product for your $$
i am not sure what is in this stuff
my husband noticed how great my skin looked too!
has never looked this good or healthy
it feels good going on the skin
i love the way it makes my skin feel
especially in the summer so refreshing to your skin
it really got rib of most of my acne i had with in 3 uses
i definitely recommend this to everyone.
i like it a lot
you can really feel it clean out your pores.
honestly i love this stuff
tonight i put this stuff all over my face
this stuff is magic for my skin!
really wanted to focus on healing my skin
i do find it to feel very cool
it did not feel uncomfortable leaving it on
i feel like i am 14
glad to see the mask is still here
i definitely recommend this to everyone!
really good pick me up
great for making my eyes feel less puffy if i didn't sleep well
i really like this mask especially when i look tired
i definitely recommend it!
after use this mask i desist of do something so harsh to my face because look great
makes it feel brighter
i really like this mask
my skin just feels
my whole face looks younger
mind you i totally just expected it help with dryness a little
my skin has never been so smooth/flawless in my life
i know picking is bad
i definitely still have to use moisturizer though
it would feel so good if worn when it's 95 degrees out
right after i am done it actually feels cleaner
this stuff is pretty good.
when you put it on it is very refreshing
my skin is definitely smoother
this stuff really makes my skin feel much better after it gets dry from the shower
it felt a little weird going on
my face did feel cool
i can definitely see how calming it is
with that said- i love it
i think it would be very nice to use after an exfoliator
it felt so amazing
definitely my go to spot treatment
so far i think it's pretty good
this is really nice if you put it in the refrigerator before applying
it's still awesome even if you just leave it in your bathroom like i've been doing recently
i've definitely noticed that my skin is a lot softer
always works wonders for my skin
whenever my skin starts to get truly terrible
makes my skin feel amazing
i really do love the way it makes my skin look.
i really do love it
i would definitely recommend this product!
this really wasn't really a game changer for me
its really good for the cali summer
don't do any good against my big pores
it's pretty different to get used to since you don't use water
i actually really love it now that i'm used to it
it feels really clean
because it works so well for me
it works well to get off my makeup
it really takes off all my makeup
that's not a nice thing to do to your loyal customers
i love the way it makes my skin feel
i really believe it has to do with this cleanser
to give you an idea
really love this new cleanser
i really benefit from it
great at cleansing the skin especially if you wear makeup
it's the first cleanser i've used where i feel like i genuinely clean my skin without my face feeling extremely dry/tight afterward
i really only ever used water to wash my face
because soaps make my skin feel terrible
i do think that the price point is pretty high
it feels like a dream
i love this formula and everything about it.
i really like the smell of this oil
enjoying a few other kate somerville products i wanted to give this stuff a try
the product itself really works
just have a nice finish to my face
this oil makes my skin look and feel great.
it is just the right amount of moisture to make my face feel great
i really recommend it!
really does the trick
i honestly noticed a difference my first use
it truly does what it claims and more, enjoy!
i would definitely recommend it.
makes it feel so smooth
i really like this oil.
i really wish it were packaged differently
still love this product
only after one use the skin felt amazing.
i am not a big fan of oils
now i'll always think about my trip when i smell this oil
i like this oil...a lot.
this oil really gives results you can see.
it smells really good too.
this worked really well
actually helped with my acne a lot
it feels so good on the skin
really this is the product i have been searching for
i felt i had to spread the word of how good this cream really is
this definitely helps with all my skin issues
it definitely has a scent
my face felt like i just applied this cream
i actually feel like it's improved the look
the tube is actually quite big
so many people said it's perfect
it's more good for combination skin i guess
i love how it makes my skin feel.
this stuff is out of this world.
this one has never made me break out which is perfect since my skin dries out terribly in the winter
it honestly feels as though it has improved the texture of my skin with use
definitely give this a try
i'd definitely try this product out
not a big fan of the packaging
hope you guys can improve it.
feel the need to for this product
love everything about it
this moisturizer really helps to balance everything out
liked this cream a lot
i feel sorry about myself
without a really oil base
it is the feeling we touch a baby face.
so you can image how nice it is.
has helped me even out my skin tone
i actually really like the smell of the ceramidin line
not for everyone, but for me, a lifesaver.
always took care of my skin
when i went to my eyebrow lady she said "wow your face is so soft
this stuff is a miracle for me.
i know it's going to last me a very very long time
you don't need a lot of this stuff
this stuff takes care of both issues
this stuff is saving my skin.
i certainly think that this has helped in the recovery of my skin
really 10 years younger looking
really like the way it melts into my skin
i've always had a difficult time finding a moisturizer that kept my skin feeling good all through the day
on its own it's really nice
makes me look younger
i'll just stick to a good moisturizer for now.
my foundation also glides on really well
however, i seem to keep coming back to this guy.
this is just so good that i had to
which is pretty short i feel
it really helped keep my h
when i put it on i was a bit nervous about how it would match my tone
i really like this cream
my skin was freaking out
i find it to be just the right consistency.
i like the smell of it as well.
i really wasn't interested in it at all
definitely recommend for any and all skin types!
but this stuff...it's just as good if not better!
had to buy it because it felt amazing on my combination skin type it's a great product to add to my daily routine
this stuff makes my skin feel good
this stuff makes me feel beautiful
this is definitely my new favourite moisturizer
my skin has never looked or felt better
my skin gets really tight after i use any cleanser so having this serum during the winter months has been awesome
it's definitely improved the texture of my skin
it really is like a drink of water for your face
i see a difference on my whole face!
my make up never looked so flawless
they do complement each other quite well i feel that it preps the skin
thought i would give it a try since sephora is so great about taking back products you are not happy with
i felt the difference
she told me to just use this
i wanted something that off the bat had the wow factor
love the way it feels
can i just say i love pretty much everything that comes from dr
it felt very light
i've spent a pretty penny doing it
this stuff is the real deal.
my skin was definitely smoother
have also definitely noticed that it fills out some fine lines
it just does something so magical to my skin that it just helps my rosacea out
this stuff is really really good.
always hoping that something will actually work wonders
i do know that it makes my foundation look amazing
they really do wonders
she loves it too
works really well with my combination
my skin has held out pretty well
it's definitely become a new winter staple for me
considering you only need 3-4 drops of this serum to make your face feel amazing
so far it's really great
i like that you get a lot of it for your money.
i've liked it- it hasn't made me break out
they work together perfectly
love how it feels under the ceramidin cream
this stuff took care of it
they're supposed to work together
i most definitely will
this ceramidin really makes a difference day-to-day
i actually genuinely see results.
that said, it still feels great.
my skin always feel fresh
still see nice results
people have a hard time believing my age
i never thought i needed a moisturizer
i just turned 50,and my skin is good.
did wonders for my tired
while it is okay
i truly feel like this has made a huge difference in my skin
i love the way my face feels after using this
how pretty my skin looks since using it
they product goes on sooo smoothly
i find myself to be wearing less foundation now because of how good my skin looks
it is here where i have seen interesting results
my face looks and feels just as smooth too.
i don't think it wouldn't work well on younger skin
the push dispenser/top is pretty cool too.
it's actually really good
my skin looks really good
the exfolikate was really good too
i really like this product.
it does feel "tight" afterward
never really noticed that.
love this stuff for the eyes!
not a look or feel im going for
i also love how it smells.
i really love this cleanser.
my skin looking even
it's not been pretty
feels really nice on the face
this one has definitely left an impression
there is definitely an improvement
i truly believe this cleanser has helped
my face feels really clean afterwards.
really love this stuff.
my skin seems to like this
i really love the products i've tried from the ibuki line
although i think i'll continue to try other products just for fun
i love how this product feels on my skin
it's so gentle, i love how it makes my skin feel!
after months ago i used clarisonic mia 2 my skin got really really dried out
i got pretty bad break outs
before my skin was pretty much flawless
although i gotta say it does dry me out a little bit
anyway, i definitely recommend it .
instantly feel in love with this cleanser
my skin was a real mess before i tried this product
i also like how it smells.
but feel like the sample worked better.
i've really come to like it
use that on really bad days
it really is a miracle product for me
i love the scent, and it definitely cleans well.
when i first got it i felt like it made my skin feel a little bit tight afterwards
i can definitely see a difference in clarity
this one makes my face feel super
made me wonder what it was doing to my skin
it also really improved my skin tone
i love all things shiseido.
i do feel like using it all the time will probably make your face dry
i think i'm going to have my cake
i never felt my face got super clean
i feel like i get a thorough wash without having a tight
this is the cleanser i always use as night.
i just gave this ibuku line a try since i've heard such good things
today at 40 i truly believe i look younger than i did when i switched at 33
i can feel that the oil
it lathers really well so you only need the tiniest bit
definitely will always find this in my bathroom.
i think the smell is a bit too strong
it really has done wonders for his skin
good for using when you want to feel indulgent
always been a fan of the whitelucent line
my skin loves this cleanser and it loves it back.
this team gets the work done
the whole ibuki line does
it feels sooo nice when you wash your face with it using the clarisonic
everything makes me break out
the wash was doing nothing good for my skin
just i don't like the after feel of my skin
my skin feel really clean in the morning
i liked it a lot
i also think think some of the dark spots have evened out
i touch my face a lot
i also didn't feel like there was product on my face like some moisturizers do
the smell is light and pretty.
i really like this moisturizer!!
i do feel like this has helped to provide moisture without causing me to breakout more
really like the consistency
my skin looked really good in the morning.
it seems like it has a lot of fragrance in it.
my skin now always feels nice
wow this moisturizer really makes a difference
it makes my skin feel amazing
my skin was in really bad condition before i found this
i think it's good
you know some products just make you feel your skin is covered by something
definitely give it a try!
i've always been afraid of moisture
actually amazing considering all the damage i've done
it makes my skin feel amazing
i feel like i have a new face.
am soooooo glad that this community allows me to find out about products like this
you're buying for quality here
i also really loved the scent.
switched to this moisturizer after reading what it was suppose to do
it makes my skin feel amazing
this product has done a lot for my skin.
i do think it has actually helped lighten up some of my acne marks
i would definitely recommend this moisturizer to anyone with combination skin like mine
especially if you're like me
i definitely think you'll get your $ worth
other products with this it's nice to have everything you need in one product
it's really helped keep my skin clear.
the only down side is the smell of the cream make me feel like
what i like about this moisturizer is that it absorbs really quickly
i see this container lasting quite awhile
i even feel like my face is tighter
i am always afraid to try new creams.
i really like it.
i am really seeing a difference in my skin while using this
i think it does help the appearance of skin over time
really helped even things out
my first impression was simply, "wow."
i will definitely add this to my skin care regimen
am always afraid of breaking out
i really like this cream
i really like the way it soaks into my skin
using the softener with it definitely makes a big difference
i felt like i needed a night time moisturizer
think it's best maybe for just as a night cream
am not sure that this would be good for oily skin
i really love this stuff.
it feels very soothing going on.
i like the whole line
i really see the difference in my skin.
my face still feels mositurized
sometimes i feel like i have tried every moisturizer on the plant…
actually thought it was cheap stuff because of the packaging
truly making me look more alive
i would definitely recommend this product!!
all it did was make me face beautiful
when i wake up i really feel the difference
if my skin still looks
i think i need to try a different one
i love this cream as i can feel it work
i just need to get used to the feel of this or i may want to consider something on top of this cream
what a difference it made to my eyes
this really works for me
i pretty much boycotted specialty creams about a year ago because nothing really made a difference to me
i think this seems like it would work really well
makes my middle age eyes feel good
hope it contains all the good things it brags about
this eye cream really seems to be helping
am really liking it
very good product, will continue to use it.
i do feel my eye area is brighter
makes my skin feel soooo smooth
makes a big difference under my eyes
heck i'll say it- i think i really do look younger
feel about my appearance
my skin was looking really rough
i really love this product.
i feel like i have a new face every morning!
really liked the feel of it
my mom wanted to know what i been using on my face because it looks brighter

i am really liking this face oil.
it seems to absorb really well
and who knew, it was amazing!
i truly love how it makes my face feel.
a lot of them smell bad
i think there is magic inside this oil.
it also makes my skin look soooo good
surprisingly i really like the idea of face "oil"
there is no greasy feel
it is really important that i take care if my skin
it really does a good job locking in moisture
works really well for the skin around the eyes
i love the whole plantscription line
it looked so bad i was getting desperate to fix it
gotta have more of this product!!
perfect for my attitude skin
love the way it makes my skin feel.
love the way it made my skin feel the first time i used it
i really dislike produt scents that hang around.
i felt that this product deserves it
'm always afraid of anything that's too moisturizing for day time
especially because i am still nursing
i really like it.
i like the feeling
make me look younger
i feel my age shows mostly in my eyes
really helps with my dark circles
now this stuff is the bomb!
this stuff is magic in a potl!
made sure to get a jar of this
my eyes definitely look better again
y that you squeeze out of those little tube things if y'all remember how those little things tasted like lol
i still love this stuff.
don't look at that as a bad thing because once you apply your moisturizer of choice your face will feel so good
find myself always coming back to this cleanser
i guess it's good for face
my face never felt so good!
it seemed to do a good job removing my makeup
i definitely still had to use moisturizer after
my face feels nice even before putting on my night cream
t is actually a pretty good value too
i still love it
i feel like it cleans well
seriously saved my eyes, plus it smells so good.
that stuff is great too!
i like it a lot.
but this one is just fit for my skin
i just really love the texture.
it makes my skin feel so great
it really made a difference in my skin.
winter can be pretty hard on my skin
washing your face with it feels so great
i feel like this "eats" it off
this cleanser is really easy to use -- it goes on well
then i think this is a great option
i would definitely purchase it
it's very kind to the skin
my skin is pretty st
this really does everything it claims to do!
it always leaves my skin feeling so nice after i use it
i really like this cleanser for morning use.
it does a good job at removing makeup
thought this would be great for my skin
again, maybe bad marketing?
nice texture for someone wanting to try out something close to an oil
it makes my skin look really goodi notice a difference with how well my make up looks after using this too
getting that stuff off is hard
i really liked the cleansing oil by josie maran
i really like it
it really does make my skin feel softer
i think it is truly making my skin healthier
my skin says it all.
it reminds me of the sanrio store i used to go to as a kid
which is saying a lot for me
it definitely does the job
this stuff is good enough!
makes my skin feel good
i suggest really getting in there
this works really well overnight
this combo has really helped my skin plump up
i can't bring myself to purchase the full size because i'm just weird like that
yea definitely need this
smells great, it's not too much.
it worked too well on me.
really enjoy using this mask.
this mask makes my skin feel amazing.
i really love this stuff.
am always trying to find a good night time moisturizer
i love the smell of this one and the feel.
it is clever advertising to call it a sleeping mask when it is just a really great moisturizer
i really like this stuff.
when i do i always see a difference
i really love it
i really like this mask
i felt like my face was sticking to my pillow a little bit
my skin feels even
some have said it smells weird
it makes my skin feel so amazing in the morning
this is a weird review i know.
this stuff has seriously changed my skin.
i'll always have it around
this stuff really works.
i would definitely recommend this product
it feels good when applied at night
i definitely see the glowing
feel so healthy when i wake up
makeup goes on like a dream
i love that you don't really have to think to much about this mask
this stuff is serious!
does not make me break out, which is nice.
definitely something to try if you have dry skin!
thing to make it feel special like it is
my skin feels great when i wake up
i really love this product.
you really only have to use a small amount of the product to get what you need out of it
i really like this.
my skin is still looking
it is very rich so keep that in mind when wearing it to sleep
i really love this cream.
this seems to help me
not really soak in
this one really seems to sit so well with my skin
everything feels alright in the world
so maybe not the ideal scent
the older ladies i know who use el always seem to have great skin
i am definitely buying one for myself!
feels so nice on the skin
amazing product you gotta try it once
i think i'm getting old because i never thought i would love a moisturizer
it seriously leaves your face feeling so smooth
i did really enjoy it
it has been making my face feel great
i really like this stuff
i seem to use it up pretty quickly.
definitely not easy on the bank account.
i can definitely tell the difference when i skip this step in my routine now
although it feels very thick when i put it on
i feel as though i've tried them all
it is very good to use at night so you wake up
this works for me.
it works well when my skin feels irritated
i think the scent is just right- not overwhelming yet refreshing
so what i've been doing that works really well is put this on first
not with this stuff underneath
so in love with it!
definitely purchasing this guy!
however i am very interested in great moisturizer because that is the best way to fight aging is having a proper moisturizer
i really love the smell
this one really appeals to me
i obviously love this moisturizer
feels so nice on the skin
my advice is to always get someone in your age range to help you at sephora
only they know what your skin really needs since they are dealing with the same skin issues that you are
this one works really well
i always look like i have a black eye on my right eye
they're gone for good
this product seems to get a lot of hate
made me look a lot less tired than i feel like i look as i age
i definitely recommend it because nothing else has worked as well as this
i really love the idea of just wearing moisturizer
i hated having to wear so much makeup under my eyes all the time
i even received a compliment on how great my eyes look
i always look tired even if i get enough sleep.
not to mention it has a cool feeling when you put it on
definitely recommend if you have hard to manage circles
liked it pretty well
it feels really rich
i love this eye cream it really helps lighten dark circles
make your eyes look younger
guess i'll see in a few weeks if it helps with my dark circles
i think it helps me look more rested
am always stressed out
the most important thing is i do find my skin tone has been evened after 7 weeks
have always had combination skin
my skin finally feels like it's healing
you definitely just need to dab it on.
definitely helps with the lines
this is definitely the one
i see a lot of reviews on here of skin peeling
i really like this moisturizer
when she turned 52 i really noticed after being away for 1 year how she was not aging very well
i like it a lot
i really like this moisturizer
love the way it feels
i can tell that my skin loves this cream.
as i really find that many lotion smells can be too strong
friends would really notice
whoa does this stuff feel good on my face
loved the texture and feel of it going on.
i feel like i've struck gold here
the sephora gentleman who helped me was right about this product i do love it
my skin looks and feels really nice.
see how your skin looks
i think that it would really be great for all skin types because it has this amazing satin-like finish on the skin
day difference with the way my makeup looks on my skin
wasn't sure i'd found a keeper
tried it just for fun as a night cream
i actually got the 100 point size of this thinking it would be perfect as an eye cream
my eyes feel a little tight in the morning
this little guy evens out my skin tone
i still look young
it really does work very well with other products
this product keeps my skin looking young
i feel like i am constantly trying to balance the moisture in my skin without breaking out
i can say my moms skin looks balanced
i really like this product.
all i want is something that feels like dessert on my face
that's exactly how i feel using this cream
i really love everything i have tried from this company
i am still re-purchasing though as this feels great on my skin
i've never found another moisturizer that hits the balance of what i need so perfectly
skin feels really good when using this
feels just fine in the summer even when i should be getting oily it keeps my skin in check always
i just love this stuff.
i will know for sure how well this works.
how it makes my face look
i also really love the smell of the cream.
the texture does feel odd at first
very nice to know it is helping my skin through the night to maintain moisture
very light but i could eat it.
i love the feel and smell too.
i wanted to really start taking care of my face
it really does make my face look
if feels good when you put it on
it's definitely working some miracles
it makes it hard to use them
i am a combination and it works for me.
since i was using a really good
it makes me feel like i had dessert even when i haven't
felt wrong for my face
)in my opinion, this is a very, very good cream.
after receiving the 10 day sample i was pretty convinced this stuff is amazing
i came to conclusion that i was really spending a great deal of $
liked it so much that i am trying algenist serum
i just thought i'd give it a try
my laugh lines are there
i definitely felt it
it left my skin feeling really smooth afterwards
feel the difference right away
use the boscia only when i really need something strong
he commented on how clean his skin felt
not only is it incredibly fun to peel off
i really can tell a difference in my skin after i use it
right after i use it my pores do feel tighter
does a really good job when peeling off
my bf has remarked how my skin immediately looks better
i've never had so much fun cleaning my face!
really enjoy this product.
depending on how i feel my face
i love it because i feel like it does what it says it will do
really help's manage my breakouts
i actually think it evened out my skin tone
it really pulls the dirt
also try not to get any of the product in your hair because it is not so fun to get out
can you say perfect environment for dark spots!!!
i mean it was pretty darn noticeable
my complexion definitely looks better
worked really well for me, i like it alot.
i really like this mask.
picked this little guy up
there is something you need to remember
so you don't feel like you're pulling
it makes your skin look amazing right after you remove it
still, for what it is, it's very good.
i like the way my skin feels after using this
you do have to use a lot otherwise it is really hard to pull off
is really easy to take off
actually feels like it's working
this made my skin feel a lot smoother after using
peel off masks are always fun
it really helps clear up her skin.
then i always use s lot of moisturizer both morning
this mask works really well to control oil
i love the way it feels when i put it on
it really feels like it cleans out all the dirt from your face
i really like this mask!
i definitely feel like it cleans out pores
i've always had a love for masks
i feel so smooth
this works really well for getting that satisfying peeling feeling when you peel it off
it does also work really well at cleaning your skin
it comes off so easy
when i used the sample i had to use the whole pack so as others have said it does take a lot to really cover your face
i think that's okay
the way i feel it makes my skin look
i definitely would recommend trying it out
it isn't very easy to get off unless you put quite a bit on your face
i loved the way my skin felt after
the way it feels
i actually really like this peel off mask
i also really liked how this mask felt on my skin
where as this one felt quite nice
i am good to go
this particular sephora was pretty busy
my first impression was that this probably wasn't going to help my sore
this item goes on smooth but is hard to get off.
it is think out of the tube
it really has helped w/my breakouts
which is basically all the time
this stuff did it for me!
nothing seemed to be working.
my skin looked that good
in like the little area not really disney
i really loved it
it really makes my face feel clean
has cleared it up tremendously
i don't think my face has ever been so smooth.
i hope it keeps working
i really love this cleanser.
this cleanser works like it was made for me
has my face feeling really good
my skin never felt 100% clean even using my clarisonic
this cleanser to make sure i got everything
i really like how well it cleans
mostly because i feel like it isn't working while i'm washing
this stuff is magic.
i feel like it really deep cleans.
i really like the way it leaves my skin feeling clean
loved them so decided to try this peel
it did a good job getting my makeup off
definitely recommend this product.
she personally recommended this to me because it's part of her routine
it is really good at taking off all of the make up
i really loved it
not my whole face
did a good just at cleaning my face
i would definitely buy this product.
my pores were always a problem
it actually makes your skin feel clean
i really like this product.
really loved this product.
made me break out like crazy
i would definitely recommend it to people with problem skin
i tried this and this actually really helps.
my skin has never looked so amazing.
this one i feel like it deserves it
my skin really likes this.
i really liked this face cleanser!
my nose has always been red for as long as i can remember
i needed something to really get my skin clean without being too harsh
i love this and how it makes my face feel.
i did take off a star because it makes the skin on my cheeks feel a little tight
it sure works well for me
i don't really feel like it made a big difference
i definitely recommend this product
this product works really well for both of those things
it really cleans the makeup off well
my skin is really weird
it was making me feel really insecure
i think i found it!
i'd say it's a pretty decent face wash
i've actually gotten compliments about how great my skin looks
this cleanser really draws them out
definitely hooked on this forever.
so be prepared for a different feeling.
this is what i found was happening to my face.
now to see just how good it is
it genuinely changed my life
this sleeping mask helped my skin tremendously
i love the way the product goes on.
feel that others don't deliver
i've spent a lot of money on things i thought would work
i see a big difference today
this product definitely helped brighten my skin
told me that my skin was beautiful
the only thing i don't like is that it can feel heavy
i really like this.
wow do i look like i'm 25 again
it does certainly brighten the skin
this stuff actually works!
give myself over to magical thinking here
the whole concept is so easy to use
leaves your face feeling very mosturized
have asked if i was doing something different with my skin bc it looks great
in the morning my skin really is smoother
and let me tell you this stuff is amazing!
i really like it
i would definitely buy this product
it makes my skin feel and look good.
this actually kept my very
i really like this
my skin is definitely brighter
love the sound of what the ingredients can do for my face
i really like it
takes a while for the really dark spots.
my husband said something to me about the look.
if a guy noticed it must work.
very important when trying to get rid of dark spots
it works for me
purchased because i was told by salesperson that this product really works great on sun spots
they really bothered me
in the morning i was truly amazed that one spot could hardly be seen
i do really think it works well
it lost a star because obviously for 123$ that's about 20$ per eye patch set
it works so good, and trust me when i say it.
it really helps with the issue
it made me look way too tired
it wasn't really dark
i like the way it feels though
it works really good, but it's pricy
this eye cream is definitely for you
you know there is good stuff in there
it seems to make a difference
i honestly thought i loved my sheisido
have been searching for awhile for good eye cream
i really like this eye cream.
it is really light and not greasy.
this product really helps
i really liked this eye cream.
it was really good
something wasn't working well
i get very little sleep
this one really helps with my fine lines
i keeps me buying it
'm not really expecting to see actual result right now because i already have young-looking eyes
you need so little to get great results
i see some people saying it was not very hydrating
i really loved the deluxe samples i was able to try out of the face cream
i could really see a big difference in getting rid of dark circles
have never really found anything that helps get rid of them
i love the way the area around my eyes feel
i like the feel
i really think it makes my eyes look
nothing you put on the skin really does that
refreshing smell that i really like
i liked the consistency
go with all of my beauty products like most of us
have definitely noticed that the fine lines around my eyes have definitely filled in quite a bit
those guys are basically tattooed on
i really like this eye cream.
i really like this product!!
this is something you will feel you need to use
i also really appreciate that it's fast absorbing
this one is a life changing thing to me
also when getting into bed my boyfriend commented on good it smells
all i can say is that i have been searching for years for a great eye crème that does what it says
if you are a bit older like me you will not be sorry
wanted to see if it really worked
what really amazed me was that my dark circles
i think i like it because it feels light.
i would love to find a whole face moisturizer that feels like this
i wouldn't want to feel anything more on my eyes
i am in love with this stuff!
most products don't feel like they are working after a couple of hours
i feel like it goes a long way
it's definitely making me want to purchase the full product
i can tell that it is a good eye cream
i found that this really helped my eyes.
i'll keep using this product as long as they keep making it it's amazing
i realized how much i loved it
an employee actually stopped me to tell me how good my skin looks
even commented on how young my face looks right now
this stuff just balances everything out
nothing was really working
one product is not going to work for everybody
i really find it works well
this was just the thing
felt nice on my skin
i find myself touching my face a lot in the morning because i just can't believe how soft it is
i loved how my skin felt waking up
i started freaking out thinking that it was never going to absorb into my skin
then i was freaking out all over again because the texture was a soft yet greasy feel
it still felt a bit greasy
however i am nervous because a lot of reviews said theirs smelled like sour milk
i first got this as a sample not even knowing really what it was
i feel like my make up goes on better
felt nice on my skin
it also looks just like milk.
definitely do recommend the product
seriously dislike the bottle as there is a lot of waste
i kid you ladies not
i feel doing all three truly makes my skin stay hydrated all day long
this product definitely works
my skin feels really hydrated everytime i use it
it's great for when you put it on right before you go to bed
that's how much i loved the stuff!
i feel like my skin looks brighter
i think the added moisture just makes my skin look revitalized
it's too bad because the actual stuff is great!
i like this product a lot
it works for me.
weird combination, i know.
i would start off with a little at a time or else it will get to feel very greasy
i really think this stuff cleared my skin
definitely makes me want to branch out into more josie maran skin care
i really love this milk product it just makes you makeup
it always seems to enlighten my face
there was an obviously progress after each use.
definitely give it a go if you're experiencing a flare up in your skin
i think it actually helped clear my skin up
it just felt like a big drink of water for my skin
it's a nice little treat!
right when i put it on i instantly feel moisture
my skin all day was so nice
33 with 3 kids who are 7
this stuff feels so good on my skin.
i don't think it would be good for me all over my face
it is seriously the only thing that helps my skin
this definitely has that thick
that's what i like to feel on my face when i go to bed
definitely need to keep a bottle of this at all times
it has a luxury feel on the skin
after always having great results from their masks
she said it the most amazing moisturizer
as every girls skin is going to be different
it made it feel
so definitely, this is it.
actually left my skin looking
i could feel a difference in my face in one day.
it definitely does its job and then some!
every time i use this gem my skin feels so smooth
i feel like it made my skin more flawless
i really love his product
it's definitely gets the job done for me
this is my go-to hydrating mask when i need something that actually works
this stuff is honestly a life saver.
seriously love this stuff.
this mask is a godsent for me
i feel you should get more
it can be hard to treat
i love adding to my night time routine or whenever i feel my skin needs a boost of moisture
i've done both and either way, still amazing!
at first i was a little bummed because she thought it was the sonic mask
i always like to use a mask after i've been drinking to help out my skin
why people go crazy for this brand.
feel a little cold on my face
this definitely does what it says
the packaging is really cute
i feel like thats mostly what you pay for
i feel that this mask is all hype
honestly its gonna last me quite a while
it felt so amazing
there's this really nice cooling effect which i really like
this product feels so nice on my skin
i really like the smell too!
found it made me breakout pretty constantly
box and it has honestly changed my skin.
have had many compliments on how different my skin looks especially when wearing no make up
i take this with me, everywhere!
not really anything special in my opinion.
smells kinda nice but so does my face cream.
it really keeps my skin nice
so, yeah...need hydration?
it smells really good too.
it feels so nice on the skin
fortunately i used my points
and to top it off it smells soooo good!
upon first use i was a little intimidated because my skin tingled like crazy
my skin just looks so amazing
i don't really consider it a mask
it just works for me.
i really like it the smell
i really love this product!
got some for myself also
though as i love that stuff
i feel funny endorsing a product that is over a hundred dollars
i can really tell a positive difference in the texture
this stuff is so amazing!
i guess there is a reason this got the allure magazine award
i love how it makes my skin feel.
it makes my face feel amazing
love the way it goes on my skin
dark marks that really make me mad waiting for them to fade
my mom tells me to thank my greaseface for the lack of wrinkles
just makes no sense
really dealing with acne
after a couple weeks i definitely saw the difference in my skin's texture
have had a hard time finding a moisturizer that does the job
i try a lot of beauty
everyone i know makes fun of the fact i have anti-aging products
i still couldn't wear makeup without it looking terrible
my face feels like i have new skin
thank you caudiale for giving me the skin i have always wanted
i am a dire-hard fan
love the feeling on my skin
nothing was really helping
i just wanted to make justice to this amazing cream
i just wanted to make justice to this amaizing cream
'm definitely starting to notice fine lines
it has never balled up or done anything weird to my skin
i get nothing but complements on this stuff.
i definitely see my skin is more smooth
so very glad they have in a jar now as didn't feel got all with bottle
this keeps me looking put together
i really like this!
what i finally realized is the best thing i can do for my undereyes is to wear sunblock--it will be better than any crazy creme out there
i do feel i still need my regular eye cream
just to be sure that i'm really protecting my skin there
i want to really make sure my eye area is protected
i'd say this is a good eye cream to get
i really like this product because of how lightweight it is
it really helped to lighten my dark spots
so this product works for me
i especially love it when is traveling
it really is a 3 in 1 product.
i do use it when my skin is feeling stressed
i feel like it does the job without drying out my skin
this one seems pretty good
really love this product!
wow, i really love this product.
it cleans really well too.
it did a really nice job taking off my liquid foundation
i feel like bith do the job good
this really does 99% of the work
this works so great for me so don't be scared by the "oil" in the name
you should definitely try this if you like cleansing oil
it really does the job
it does a really good job of removing makeup
it really does a good job
i love how this cleanser really clean my face .
the reason i love this product is because after i used it it doesn't feel like i feted my face out
i never feel any residue afterwards.
this just makes my face feel so clean.
my face does not feel greasy
thinking that this would be great
i seriously really love this oil.
definitely takes off about 95% off the makeup
follow with a cleanser to really get all of the benefits
i really love this oil
it is really light on the skin
it really removes everything off my face
this did a really good job at breaking my make up off
my skin has been playing very nice with this especially since i have acne prone skin
this product has really grown on me.
even my mom commented that my skin just seemed overall brighter
that's why i was so thrilled to find this cleansing "oil" which is actually oil-free
it's really goodbut price is kinda high:(
it works really well
i would purchase again as it still works pretty good
making it good to use for my eyes too
i don't think this would be good for someone with very dry skin
this oil gets the job done
this one definitely does the job
it is definitely a cog in the wheel that got me to less breakouts
i also wear a lot of makeup
this stuff works so well for me
i think it makes me look about 15 younger!
quite often left me with dark eye circles unless i really worked at it
it does what it says- it takes off all the stuff we ladies put on our face so we can face the world
i am good to go
i always get a little bit in my eyes
anyways my foundation looks so smooth every time i put it on
really like the ease of this product.
works great, i can definitely tell a difference.
this product works really well for me .
it always looks good initially
it's pretty good in my opinion
it honestly makes my skin look flawless
all seems to be going well
you need to use very little for good moisturization
overall i still really like this cream.
really like this mask, i use it 1-2 a week.
goes on really smooth
i feel like this product makes a difference in those areas
it is definitely pricey
so am not really 'seeing' anything
it says ladies saw results in as little as 4 weeks so stay tuned ok girls
it work really well
i've never really used foundation
getting older i wanted something to make
the good thing is this tube lasts for awhile.
i think it blends in my imperfections quite well
i loved how smooth it made my skin
how flawless it made my makeup look
i can tell you this does amazing things for your skin
really thought it would be like every other primer i've tried
really smoothed me out
i feel like i am leaving so much product in the container
save your money guys :
the price kinda scared me
you should definitely try this primer out
that's not really a problem for me
i think this product is pretty good
one thing that really intrigued me about this is that it works best when you set it with a little bit of powder before applying a liquid on top
lately everyone i know has been complimenting my skin- not my makeup- how my skin looks
i so wanted to love this product
it does feel nice once rubbed into the skin
just when i thought lancome had all the best stuff for minimizing wrinkles they came out with this- it really helps blur lines under makeup
it's worth it when you want to look really nice
the smell is just like visionnaire
definitely not flowery like some have mentioned
i love the way it feels on my skin.
i wear it without makeup or with because it is a great primer as well
i feel good that i'm not getting the parabens
i really like this moisturizer.
this one really gets to me
i love the way it smells and feels.
it doesn't do much good for me now that i live in a very dry area
this works for me.
this stuff works wonders
i really love the product
that smell is not that good it almost made me throw up
my skin just love it.
everyone obviously has different experiences with this product
it has really made a difference
my skin has never looked so good.
especially like it when i use it at night
it was getting really cold out
i think people get duped into thinking a product needs to be heavy
it feels like your skin can really breath
then this is a good choice
i definitely feel it adds an extra bit of "glow
still makes my face feel
i really enjoy this one
i feel it makes my skin brighter
i would definitely recommend it to a friend
it feels so refreshing when you apply it.
definitely recommend this product to anyone
this is a fun mask to put on as you massage the mask
however my skin does feel really calm after using this mask
the funny thing is that i am not a huge fan of this line
it sounded interesting enough for me to try
i really enjoy applying it
i feel like my skin looks like my personal best skin for the next few days after using
i really like this mask.
i feel like i've had my little jar forever
this delivers something like that.
it definitely feels smooth
it has a nice menthalated smell if you're into that
my skin truly felt softer
i love the way it goes on.
gotta switch it up after all
you can actually feel your skin breathe following the treatment
i wasn't quite sure what i was getting when i ordered the small size of this product
not only is this mask fun to apply
this stuff is so good
this mask works so well for my skin!
wear it the whole time
it really makes a difference by using it even 1 time each week
it was definitely brighter
my skin was going through a "not looking so good stage
it was like my skin needed this.
i really like the results
i really love this product.
it's important to really massage it into the skin so those little beads break open
let me start by saying my skin was always normal
i like to think this mask helped
feel it still deserves 5 stars
i love coming from work
this is definitely a must have mask!
this stuff really works
it really blew my mind how well this product works
not only does it smell good, feel good, it works.
i feel like i have some redness on my face
everyone always tells me i'm too picky
i love the way it leaves my skin looking
my skin never felt so skin
my face usually get really red
skins looked so young
i like this mask a lot
thinking that i'll use it
but the first time i used it i really liked it!
it really did make my skin look a lot better!
as i have found you really get what you pay for
you can feel that your whole face got lifted
she loves it too
if you find yourself in my situation you should definitely consider this mask to help save your face
my mother always told me that taking good care of my skin is important
i absolute love the way my skin looked after just one use
was really feeling the green
had some really bad pimples
she said my skin looked better
sephora , you always have a winner.
i knew something felt different
i knew something felt different
i knew something felt different
i knew something felt different
i knew something felt different
i knew something felt different
this one really did something different.
have always wanted to use a mask
you can actually feel it working
people think i have on foundation
i really love this product
i actually had a friend ask what i was doing to make my skin 'glow
also it really does brighten the skin!
it also works really well under makeup.
this definitely felt better in the winter
the jar really goes a long way
i've always had pretty good skin
you will love the way your skin feels and looks
he knows his stuff
it does feel slick when first applied
adds some colour correcting which i really need for my dark circles
not in a scary way
i really like this product.
definitely feel like my skin tone has improved
friends say my face looks brighter.
this really helps even things out
whenever i wear it under my foundation it really gives me this nice shine without it looking like i'm oily or greasy
i didn't really pay a whole lot of attention to how much i liked it until it was gone
it feels just right
he loves this product!
it just hasn't been great for me personally
i would definitely love to try the hydration booster too to compare
i honestly love this stuff!!
one thing i can tell is the skin really glowing
i think this evens my skin out
i feel like it is working to help lighten spots.
i can tell that my skin is brighter
i swear i have never gotten so many compliments on how good my skin looks
just putting this on makes my skin feel all glowy
i really do love this product.
it really does brighten the under eye
i really like this product.
wanted to have something that kept me from looking like that
it genuinely brightens my under eye area
this product helps me a lot
i really like this product
it definitely brightens my eyes
straight talk- i had comments all the time on how tired i looked until i started using this stuff
it really does what it says
i like this product a lot as it helps with brightening under my eyes
so this product has help me look more awake than i really am
i think that is what helps with the bags
it really helps to wake me up
it really does feel goo
i still want to look presentable
so i got this thinking it was an eye cream.
i feel as if the dark circles under my eyes are intense
it amazes me every time i put it on
it doesnt affect any other make up that i put on which is nice
i just look tired
i really like the formula
i can tell very quickly that it is working.
i would recommend a concealer over it still if you have very dark under eye circles like myself
my under eye area has always been a problem for me
it is really easy to over use and waste.
the metal tip feels really nice
application is kind of hard
this stuff is so so so good!
really helps me wake up in the morning
i like that it has a bit of color to it.
it feels so good
seriously, i can't get over how lovely it feels!
cant get the right pressure to just get a little amount
i've always been told "you can correct color
it has done wonders for my under eyes
the only reason this product is not getting 5 stars from me is because of the horrible packaging
nice product to even out under my eyes
man this stuff works
sometimes the metal part just feels great on tired eyes
i also love this for when i'm too busy being a tomboy to care about makeup
feel like they look younger
i like this stuff
i feel you can get more bang for your buck with another br
this stuff makes me look awake
you use so little that this tube is going to last me awhile
you should use this mask because it seriously helps a lot
you do get a nice size jar
i really like this mask
this mask is frankly awesome if you have dry or sensitive skin
i definitely see a difference afterwards.
not only does it really brighten the skin
you can definitely see a difference after each use
this is really a must have
good thing i did or i would never have known what a great product this is
overall, i'm really please with this product.
now i didn't realize the product actually makes your skin feel very tight as it drys
it looks that way
my skin didn't feel tight
i would definitely reccommend it.
it definitely made it softer
i feel like this has ingredients to treat all of those issues
i can definitely tell that there is a difference
it eally did a nice
my foundation was feeling too heavy to wear- by the end of the work day i felt like a grease ball
am really loving the results
the moment i removed my mask i could feel a difference
it has a small tingling feeling that i really enjoyed
this mask really makes a difference
not a big fan of the scent
you are thinking about getting this product
it made my lips feel so good
this makes my skin feel great i use it under my moisturizer
i feel like this product is something i'm going to use for the rest of my life
i really like this product!
so overall it's good, but do be careful.
feel it is deserving of a 5 star review
the main thing i like about this cream is that makeup goes well over it
this stuff is out of this world!!!!
really should having said that
really work it into your skin
i noticed not all of my makeup was always removed
it does very well either way
kinda of like well, every other cleanser.
it feels really good to put a warm cloth on your face at the end of the day
i just want to add that my skin felt instantly softer
i find this to be a very soothing way to end my day
gets the job done
this really helped to clear up my super oily
satisfying way of doing it
the product pretty much does what is says.
i love how it makes my skin feel deeply clean
while i like to try other things
i felt something coming up through my skin
leaving a hot cloth on your face for a little bit is just so enjoyable
i literally have never felt this way about a cleanser
it does the job pretty well
while i do really love the smell of it
but it smells and basically does the same thing.
i really love how i applied two pumps
i really like this cleanser.
it was always too harsh for my skin
i even made fun of him for doing so
my skin looked even
i really do like this mask
it does some pretty great things
feels soothing when you put it on
this mask has been so good to my face
i definitely notice them
if that makes sense
like you have to really move the product around
makes me skin feel amazing!!
i personally enjoy using it
know that it is working
trying to find a good balance
we love it and we think it works.
let me know it was working
the only thing i didn't like is that it made my face tingle a little bit
because i really love smell of it.
i really recommend it.
i really like this product.
my skin really does look
it also feels very refreshing, i love it!
because it doesn’t look weird
i don’t know why the fridge makes such a huge difference
never feel irritation, either.
so i had to buy the whole thing.
'm starting to see some fine lines
when i use this my skin looks taught
i would really like to try it that way too
you can feel it sinking in
it really starts to sink it--
my skin looked and felt amazing.
i love the way it smells and it's not too strong.
this mask has really helped me combat all my problems
for me it works
it does feel good after being in fridge however be careful because my pot cracked all the way firm the side as a result of doing this
i actually really, really love this mask.
my skin has really transformed
i know everyone's chemistry is a little different
this stuff is amazing very soothing my face definitely looks younger in the morning
i definitely recommend this product!
either way i actually feel like its helped reduce my blemishes
i wish they offered something for the day that would make my face look/feel as great
it seems as though my skin is really agreeing with it
beauty hurts, right ladies?
you get a lot of product
my face always feel so clean after
makes my skin look so nice
because i feel like it can be too harsh to do am
i really like this
feels really refreshing after i wash it off
this cleanser seems to know how to adapt
i just make sure to follow it up with a good moisturizer
i love how my face feels after using it
something that's hard to do since he constantly sweats
this definitely helps maintain my skin
it was actually making me breakout.
i can honestly say my skin looks really good.
like how skin should feel
then it really does clean
i love that you get quite a good amount
so $38 every six months really isn't that bad
it made my skin feel amazing!!
everyone should really give it a try!
i really do like it.
i really enjoy using this cleanser.
it works wonders on my face
i notice that after washing my skin definitely does feel tight
i would definitely skip this wash
the nice scent what i also really like that it doesn't dry out my skin
i do feel my skin is brighter
i really like the thick consistency
i definitely recommend this product!
young skin doesn't really need it
this was jus a product i read so many great reviews on i had to try for myself
the only thing is it does make my skin feel tight
my skin is already pretty darn amazing
at first i really did not like the consistency
it's definitely a gel consistency.
anyways the benefits are good.
not only does it smell nice.
i really love this!
something tells me i won't have to for awhile since a little goes a long way
it truly does brighten up the skin
definitely wanted to try this cleanser out
like i got a good night's sleep
this really worked well!
this is an honest review as i never really leave reviews unless i really love something
some werent so great
i hate the feel of makeup
i love that too
this is the kind of makeup where people will compliment you by saying
i feel like no one should be happy about hearing "i like your makeup" because for me
i think i've found it!
people say my skin looks really fresh assume i wear no makeup
how it feels like nothing on your skin
i love it because it looks like i am not wearing any foundation
like wearing nothing at all besides good quality skin care
feels like you have nothing on the skin
thankfully i can make this color work for me
it definitely lives up to its name.
it is my go to whenever i want a very natural skin like finish
it just makes your skin look really good.
just love this product!
i hate that heavy feel
i fell in love with how it made my skin feel
yeah baybaaa, i like it like that!!
looks exactly like skin.
i love how light this feels
i've found it really goes on best using my fingers
i get compliments all the time wearing this foundation
the fact that there's only one shade is a pretty big problem
told me i was doing too much
i decided to give this stuff a shot
even feels good on my skin
this foundation always looks good on me
it gives you a nice amount of coverage on days you dont want to go full on make up
i love the idea of looking like i'm wearing nothing at all
everyone says that i know
i feel like it actually controls my oil production
i love the way my face feels and looks with this!
feels like i'm wearing nothing on my skin
this is a very nice product that i tried as a result of my daughter's recommendation
i hate those feeling
one of the worker in sephora told me that it gave a very very sheer of coverage
you really don't see it on skin
i feel like this would be perfect for summer
definitely not for you if you need a lot of coverage or have very dry skin
it makes my face look really smooth
am so in love with this.
goes on really smooth and evens out skin.
it's not a good pick for anyone with really light skin
feels like i'm not wearing foundation
wanted to share that i think this foundation is pretty amazing
i've never liked the way i looked with a full face of makeup
it just looks like my skin
even though i loved the way it felt on my skin
i really like this product
i always get compliments on my skin when i wear it
my one problem with this foundation is that it is very orange
i love the feeling of not wearing foundation
ohmygawd i love this stuff so, so much!
or feeling like i do
want something to even out my skin tone
regular foundation was too thick or just didn't feel good
makes me look like me
the bad news is that the color is too dark for me
i really like this foundation.
other than that i really love this foundation
i blend it well on my neck so not a big issue
i always get compliments on my skin when i wear this
that is definitely not how it has worked for me
noticed that my skin looked really great on camera
i've tried many foundations trying to find the right one for my skin tone
i told the person helping me that i wanted something to give me tiny bit more coverage to the bb cream i was using
t's making me look good *
this stuff gives me just enough coverage to appear naturally polished
i do that because i feel like all foundations
just makes me look like i'm wearing a mask
just beautifully evens out my skin tone without making me look like i'm wearing a mask
lately i have been feeling like it looked shiny
i like that the no foundation is really sheer.
i tried this product after i found out how much my boyfriend loves it
it truly does wake you up!
the idea of this product is to help you look less tired
i like the smell because it reminds me of my husb
it was pretty interesting (feeling).
although my face does feel kind of tight now i really love it so far
i really like this product
just makes you feel great after every application
regardless of how you felt beforeh
i personally feel more relaxed after the sensation
my daughter asked me what i was doing different
s-a nice side effect has been that it's made my nails harder
the smell is so pretty and it absorbs quickly.
i wanted to try this product because my skin was starting to feel very rough even thought i had been using the herbal recovery gel
this is the really nice for summer it's very light
my skin in 4 weeks feels like the skin i had in my 20's
when you wake up your skin will feel amazing
it helps me relax
the morning after using this product my skin always feels softer
this stuff has gotten it back into shape
i really had no expectations
i really love the smell.
i always wake feeling very plump
overall feel like my eyes are being well treated
i do feel that overall my eye area does look firm /plump
my eyes feel so good!
i love having a product that i am not worried about what i am putting on my face
knowing that it is helping my eyes
i can feel it tightening when i put it on.
probably always will be my go to for gentle
it is really helping with my dark circles
if your main concern is just having something gentle to cool
'm keeping that in mind as i review
how refreshing it feels under your eyes
so that is on me
you definitely do not need to apply a lot of product
feels so good on
people are shocked when i tell them my real age
which is great since before finding this cream i felt like my face/ eye area was not getting what it needed
it's still too new for me to say it makes an amazing difference
also, you really get a big bang for your buck!
i actually quite like this.
feel like the jar will last a long time which is great value for money
i really like this eye cream.
i can feel it tightening my eye area
ive seen a huge difference in how the product works since doing it this way
thats hoiw you feel after
this cream has made me feel human again in the morning
i feel like my eyes don't look tired anymore.
i love the way my eyes feel after
i am not sure that it was good enough for me
i definitely recommend it
i pretty much love all fresh products
not so good for daytime because it takes a lot of time to absorb completely
pretty sure i'll be ordering this product again
i love how my under eye looks
feel after using this
i love how this feels on my eyes.
it feels soooo good on the skin
this stuff really does!
you can really feel the moisture
i always switch up my products
you still feel the benefits
step 2 isn't really necessary in my opinion
i honestly find myself reaching for this over my other eye creams
i really do feel like it's a very awakening eye cream
honestly think this is way more hydrating
she told me this was an amazing moisturizer for your eyes
definitely feels like a high end eye cream.
this has really made a difference in the hydration
i really wish i had photos to show how well it works
), and this product really lightens them.
after using it for only a week my acne spots that i feel like i had for life start dissapearing
you can't put a price on feeling great about yourself
was excited to hear about something new to try on my sun spots
nothing has really worked for me in the past
even commented on how great my skin looked
this is definitely a keeper!
it's definitely working for me
they get the job done.
you really feel like your nose is clean in the end
they worked really well for pulling out my pores
make sure that it's very wet
i definitely notice a difference between these
it really gets in there
i definitely notice a difference
these work pretty good.
definitely a+ for my skin
2 really work together in an effective way
i really love these
it definitely has helped
i really really love this two-step nose strip
this really does work!!
this really helps to keep them down
they looked like fun
all in all, i like these things.
nothing really worked out
it definitely took a lot off
i can really tell the difference!
this stuff really did its job on my nose
i feel that this product done its job very well.
although you do feel little pain when using the first step one
which i think it's very good
we both love them!
i love these things.
they clear out your nose so good
overall i really liked it
i really like that they have the day
besides the dark circles i also have bags which make me look tired
i do love that the day cream definitely brightens my eye area
never really absorbed all that well
i do find that it gets in my eyes
i really love both the am and pm eye creams.
i am also fair with some pretty dark circles
i feel like i have tried every eye cream possible
'm thinking "this is it
i feel like i look more awake!
i can definitely see improvement in the skin around my eyes
my face has never felt this smooth!
the mask feels very intense when i first put it on my skin
my skin feels really good after washing it off so that's a plus as well
it seems to be just what i needed to keep my redness
we both recommend for sure.
it really helped oil control
it makes my skin feel really clean
i really like the smell personally.
and it felt so nice putting on.
that felt kind of weird
it was everything i thought it was be
i don't really mind the smell as it isn't super strong
this in my opinion does smell a little weird
my skin just feels like it can breathe again
when you use it, it gives you a very clean feel.
the product works really well
very nice mask you have to try
plus i wasn't really fond of the smell
honestly i really liked it
i really love this product--it definitely does not dry my skin out like most cleansers do
know there are a lot of bad reviews
this is the only thing that has helped my skin
my face just felt so clean
definitely recommend for those who want to try the supermud
i really enjoyed using this mask.
it literally made my skin feel so gooooood.
it feel as though it is really pulling out dirt from my face which is amazing
now i need a the real thing
this morning i can feel a huge difference!!
i don't really have much of a problem with acne
smelt a little funny but definitely worth it.
it definitely stings at first
like the feeling of my skin after
i really like it smells like green apple makes my skin feel tight only thing is price
it's definitely better by morning
i really love how little i have to use of it
it is definitely effective for someone who wears a lot of makeup
rosacea so when i first put this on i thought it felt like all other masks
love this product your face feels so smooth
you can feel it working.
all i can say is that this entire line is blessed
i love this stuff so much
you can definitely see a difference in your skin
i feel like this mask is really nice
it does feel nice
it smelled a little weird at first to me
not only does it moisterize my face perfectly without leaving it tight feeling
this is a good treatment for anyone who wears a lot of makeup
it really does feel velvety when you are done.
you should definitely try this mask
i started using this product because i wanted to start taking better care of my skin
you can feel it working right off the bat--makes your skin glow
i found that it really improved my skin
afterwards i didnt really feel like it changed my skin much
my vote is this stuff works
it made my skin feel amazing just after one use
it really worked for my skin
this made my face feel nice and smooth.
i don't think it's ever looked so good
i definitely felt a burning sensation upon application
wanted to take the day to really focus on feeling good
none of them really helped
my skin felt great afterward with no irritation.
honestly loving this stuff!
feel your face really is clean
when there’s always dirt you can’t see
i left it one for about an hour because it just felt so good on my skin
love the way my skin looks
my skin has never looked so good.
my face has never felt cleaner especially when i remove this mask with my clarisonic
it really improves my skin
loved how my face felt the morning after i used it

so glad i came across this little gem!
it definitely does not like anything on top of it
i really enjoy this product

love the smell and feel.
this stuff works miracles.
like how people said
also makes your eye feel tight in the morning
it just feels smooth
definitely a wow product for me.
i honestly can feel it working
who cares when no matter how tired you feel
i feel like i need a bit of hydration with it
i really love the way it smells and feels.
i am definitely going to buy it
the cooling of this product has really helped a lot
you're getting a lot for what you pay for
never seen an eye cream work this well!
nothing really worked for my puffy eyes
a very little is all you need to put on both eyelids
you also get a lot of product.
it works very well on depuff---- which i love it.
if this gel is not miraculous then this gel is most definitely the bomb
you need this stuff-it's amazing!
sometimes make me look like an alein
this stuff worked wonders even the first time i tried it
i would most definitely recommend this to everyone who has ever had bad morning puffiness

this stuff is a miracle.
this product felt so good under my eyes it relaxed me i miss having it tremendously it is thick
after a hard days work it is so good for your eyes
love the way it feels on my eyes
if you don't like products that feel like they sit on your skin
i think over time it definitely brightens skin
this stuff is really really amazing
my skin hasn't looked this good in a long time.
i can definitely look past it because of how amazing my skin felt
my skin always feels smoother after.
i truly do believe that this product has transformed my skin's texture for the better
i noticed my skin was definitely a lot smoother
so don't get nervous if this happens.
i make sure to massage it in well while i wait
ncredible that i really wanted to take the time to add to the other positive reviews on here so more people can experience it
this stuff it a little harsher on my skin-i definitely feel some tingling
really does what it says.
so, i like it that it works.
you can feel it working so the tingle is normal.
everything cause me problems in my skin
i give it 5 stars because it works

i am in love with the way it smells as well!
it feels like it's just going to work
it is a lot, i know.
i really do enjoy this product quite a bit.
honestly felt like i'd just left my dermatologist
the initial burn mellowed into a nice warm tingle that definitely was doing something
the science behind all peter's stuff is pretty sound
my skin has been really clear.
you can feel the burn
it definitely tingles a lot more than other aha masks i use
i feel that it's really hard to get off though.
knew pumpkin was a good thing
this mask really feels like it's changing my skin back to how it used to be
i love how smooth my face feels
right after i used it my skin felt amazing
my skin loves me for it
definitely give this one a shot
such an amazing mask especially when you put it before you're going out for a " special occasion " or something it leaves u with a great skin
my skin has been going through a freak out lately
this one was definitely the st
i just fan my face for that time
i can feel the difference in my face
this stuff is amazing it makes my skin so soft
i feel like i'm going to buy this mask simple because of how amazing it smells
you can definitely feel it tingle on your face
which is very hard to do
really glad i got this.
it actually felt very cooling
it really does work perfectly
it is everything it says i love this product.
i can honestly say that this stuff is amazing.
i can say that this stuff has already helped tip lighten them after just 3 uses
putting it on, it definitely burns a bit.
i feel like this has really helped my pores
tingles but really works!
i definitely feel my skin is softer
i really love this mask and i will keep buying!!!
this mask felt so good on my face
it was a bit tough to get it all off
i feel like this mask did everything those pads promise to do
the first time i ever tried this i thought o was having an allergic reaction as my face literally burned so bad
i feel like 5 years just came off of my face!!
my skin always feels so fresh after use.
let's me know it's really working
it smells pretty good too
feeling like it was really working
honestly my face has never felt so clean after using this mask
my skin felt and looked like a baby's bottom.
for me i barely even feel it- maybe a little tingle around my nose
definitely not too harsh either
it does feel very warm when you first apply
appreciate my skin now
if you're like me the burning makes it feel like its actually working
doing something for me
it was really hard to get rid of them
gets the job done
because it's honestly perfect for me
i also love that it's pretty gentle
this is definitely worth trying if you have dry skin
this has really helped tone it down love this cleanser
it's always my go to!
i love how easy the pump is also
like to wear a lot of make up
i feel like it'll last me forever
you definitely need a moisturizer after using this
i feel like it does a good job of removing my makeup
i'll still give it 4 stars though because of the great job it does in removing makeup
how my face feels
this stuff really works
my skin doesn't feel dry afterwards it just feels nice
i feel really clean afterwards
i really like this cleanser!
i really enjoy this one.
i love the way my face feels after i use it
i really prefer this cleanser
really helped me with my dark spots
really makes my skin feel amazing
i really like this as a night cream.
asked me what i use to get such beautiful
does only good things for my face
i always recommend it to people
i still love it
this stuff is simply amazing
this cream makes me feel
it is a product that actually works for me
how weird this might sound it honestly feels like you found the fountain of youth
love everything about it.
at 45 i don't feel like i need make up after i put it on
i love the way this makes me feel.
thought what the heck
i could definitely see how it would be anit-aging as well
felt weird on my face
i must say since i've been using it there has been quite a difference in the whole appearance of both my face
my skin really feels firmer
i never found a moisturizer that really worked for me until i found this cream
i dont really notice the difference of my wrinkles
i really love it
i personally really like it
i really dislike the smell
i love the feel of my skin in the morning
it feels so refreshing
i know that sounds crazy
but it just feels so good, i keep using it!
love the way it felt.
ive noticed it does a nice job of keeping my skin smooth even after washing my face
it just makes my skin feel better.
i've wanted to take my skin care seriously
clinique smart night gets the nod here
this smart serum has improved my skin in ways i really didn't think possible
this works really well for my acne.
i love how it makes my skin feel
i definitely feel like it's made my skin smoother
this stuff is like a miracle
this stuff is like magic
it really improved the way my skin looked.
all of a sudden 2 weeks ago everyone started to tell me how good my skin looks
i just thought to myself
my face didn't feel as amazing
honestly doubt i'll shop around for a different serum after having this
definitely helped dark spots
my face was definitely brighter
i will hopefully see a difference in my dark spots
with my skin feeling good in the morning
it can really transform your skin into an even
the texture makes my skin feel like it's getting the support it needs to avoid fine lines
i really like it.
this stuff is really pricey
it's definitely pricy but my skin feels amazing.
i think it's really important to use serums
my skin just started to look
…people started asking me what i was doing because my skin looked amazing
my skin definitely feels healthier.
keep getting told i'm too young to be doing my job
my mom asked me what i was doing different with my skin
feel of my skin is definitely improved while using this
another thing it does really well is get rid of the bags under my eyes
look forward to putting it on because it makes my skin feel like silk
pretty bad redness on my face
k have never loved my skin so much
it works wonders for my skin
2 x a day makes me breakout like crazy
at 34 i was really hoping
while i really love all of the products i've purchased this particular product just wows me
thought it was a good product
i am really starting to like my skin!
obviously everything is not for everybody.
i really have to let people know how great this serum is
my skin has never looked as good as it does now
definitely use some kind of moisturizer underneath
but i like it a lot!
it does not feel nice to apply on the entire face
at least personally it does not feel comfortable
it does a very good job of fading them
there are some products that just feel right on my skin
i feel my skin is changing
i felt it worked ok
this one really works
i absoultely love the way it makes my skin feel
i am not sure it really works in terms of repairing any wrinkles or damage
makes my skin feel it's best!
i love how it helps to take off my make up
i really like this cleanser
it makes my skin feel
i really love this product
if that makes sense?
my skin is all too happy to flare up over just about anything
i kind of love how it smells
i like the way it feels in my face
it works really well and smells good, too.
the only reason why i am giving 4 stars for this is because this stuff is really pricey
this eye cream is working very well for me right now
it will burn like the dickens for a good 5-10 mins
luckily don't really have crow's feet
i can for sure feel it tighten
does a decent job of "lift" but so do others.
this eye-cream really fixed the situation
after a week of using it there was something different with my eyes in a good way
really only expecting some hydration like all others i have tried
i definitely feel like my eyes look better
definitely a better product that bliss youth as we know it
this is definitely a keeper
really like this product
i think it'll last quite awhile
i noticed that my dark circles had gotten really bad
i can actually feel the lifting.
had no idea what it was for what it felt like or smelt like lol it's great
it was crazy really i try alot of oils to.
i see my makeup looks nicer a
the smell alone puts me in a great mood every morning
this time of year it's very hard to look fresh
i really like this moisturizer.
i never get compliments like this
have done wonders for my skin
gets absorbed in really well
although my face feels great after applying it
let all these wonderful ingredients do the work when i sleep
it must really work as someone called me a young lady the other day
i love the look, feel and smell.
i do enjoy this product quite a bit
it's ok for some products to be too strong for some people
really just enough to wet my fingers seems to be enough
you might feel a bit of burning
it didn't feel like the skin i've been living with the past 25 years or so
not really on the face
i love how this feels on my skin
i love how it makes my skin feel fresh
a lot of people are complaining about the smell
definitely do a patch test
i found out the hard way to not use it on 'broken' skin
i really like it
i really liked it
my face feel very smooth
this really helps brighten your skin when used a couple times
i definitely see myself getting the full size
it is still a nice treat for your face
i take good care of my skin
it's pretty strong stuff
i think my moisturizer works better after this.
it really feels like a real facial
we appreciate the advice of others like ourselves at sephora
my skin did feel a bit tight
i used it whenever i felt i looked tired
my skin did feel instantly brighter
really feel that it is probably effective for a certain skin chemistry because i believe both sides of the fence on this one
i can't believe how great this product worked for me
really love this item
it really does few like new skin after
i like this product a lot.
perfect skin pick me up when you just don't have a lot of time
feel some results afterward
just the best--makes your skin visibly amazing in just one use
like many have tried a ton of stuff
i really like this cream
i cant really describe how my face skin had improve
the bad thing is
thought this might be fun to try
i assumed it would be expensive because it really is amazing
not sure i expected it to be quite this expensive :o to be fair though you really only need a very small amount for your whole face
the downside is that the cream's texture is a bit weird
it's a little tough to get out so a spatula would be a good idea
my complexion has looked really looked great since i started using this product
it really made a difference in the texture of my skin
i really like it
after half a year of use i can honestly say my skin texture is smoother
my skin has never felt or looked better.
i really loved this product
whenever i use it i always see a difference in my skin
feels good going on
my skin is the one thing i always feels lets me down
it has seriously never looked so good!
it was the only thing different i had done
i would say it's a pretty good product
honestly this product has changed my skin.
i've never been someone who sees that big of a difference with products
not really thinking about it
literally made my skin look better
my skin has never felt so good before.
this product helps my skin look and feel better.
my face would get so stressed
this product has definitely helped with my crows feet
i definitely recommend it
have a hard time committing to things like this
as it plays well with anything you put on top of it
i feel like when i use my other products after this
took me a bit to see a difference
because my face is so smooth
really made a difference in about a week use.
this product really helps to prevent my skin problems
it seems really pricy
trust me this treatment is making all of my beauty products look a whole lot better
i would definitely recommend people try this out
it does feel light
this stuff was working
i love the feel of this concentrate
in my pores is just too good
i find that i am using less of my other stuff
it definitely helps control oil
i am really enjoying the way this makes my skin feel
i can tell a difference with this which is a huge deal for me
liked it enough that i kept buying it
what i find crazy is how many people are saying how amazing my skin looks
i really don't see any super crazy changes
hey if i keep getting compliments i'll be buying a bottle if this very soon
it definitely helped to lessen it
i feel like my skin looks
saying that everyone who has tried it loves it
she wasn't kidding--this product really delivers.
obviously trusted whatever they had
i do a lot already to take care of my skin
this concentrate has definitely taken things up a notch
i could definitely tell that my skin was improving
made me skin look
i hate when you use a product that makes your skin look good
this stuff really works to perfect your skin it blew me away its the best thing i have used so far
i love the way that this makes my skin feel.
i already feel a difference
it truly does make my skin firmer
you'll be really happy with the way your skin looks
i personally like it
i really like this stuff.
i really love this eye cream.
i really love the way it smells
it feels good and not greasy!
it honestly makes my skin feel really hydrated
thank you so much
this mask is too amazing not to
this is definitely the winner
you can definitely feel it working
the whole time i keep it on
it makes my face feel cool
they mostly feel great going on
someone mentioned this was a good mask
you can just feel it working on the skin
which i actually enjoy
that's saying a lot for my skin
i think it's really nice fresh smell
the trick is to really massage it in
i actually love the way it feels
leaves my skin feeling really nice
spent all kinds of crazy money
feel of how my skin feels
i always tone after to get anything left
really like this product.
feels great before going to bed!
i tried several samples of this product to make sure that i liked it
plus it really gets my make up
it feels so good!
i don't use this at night to take my makeup off because i don't feel like it gets everything off
it does feel really great to use
they love how it makes their skin feel
how it made my skin feel
it never feels tight after i use this product
i've always used the more 'soapy' style because i feel those remove everything
i really like the smell of this too
it is very good when you were makeup every day
i love this stuff- it goes on as a gel
i feel it does a great job at removing my makeup
making my skin feel overall clean in just one step
it does have sort of a weird smell
to me it kind of smells like
after using this a week my skin is truly brighter
this cleanser comes pretty darn close to making me use it
because i really liked the feel of the oil on my face
'm going to do just that
my skin has never looked or felt better
i really can see a difference in my skin
well... i think this stuff would be too thick.
my skin does not feel tight after using this
when you are done
that's what it smells like to me
skin is really glowy after couple uses.
i really like the scent, too.
takes off make-up very well.
this is first one step cleanser i have ever used where not only does my face feel super clean
i love the feel of it.
i really like this.
as i felt nothing was working
this stuff really takes off not only my makeup
this stuff is the bomb
it is hard to excite me
which is a very good thing
it's very hard to take off
i felt like my skin was suffering.
since it does such a great job at removing everything i feel that my overnight skin care routine truly does its job
it feels good going on
sometimes i'll go back over my foaming cleanser with this because i just love the way it makes my skin feel
i really enjoy it with my clarisonic.
my skin feel so good after using it
to my surprise it works really well
it really was the cleanser
it felt a little weird going from a gel to an oil to a milky
but this one i really like .
it all really works for me
i really loved it!
eyes really look amazing after about two weeks now
certain things really blow me away
i feel like i should :
to prove that this product really works
not kidding - this stuff is amazing!
my whole eye area feels tighter
the area under my eye is really smooth.
i always like to try new creams
i made the mistake of rubbing my eyes too hard
this stuff really reduces it
i am really liking it
i also don't eat all that healthy so my skin is going to reflect that
literally everything to help me with my very red cheeks
life changer for sure!
it hasn't felt this good in months
right of the bat i'm going to say this product is great
i really like this cleanser.
it really takes makeup
it just feels like you just put on a intense moisturizer
both feel so good topic on
this product actually makes me want to wash my face
i always use this first to get off all of my eye makeup
i really am in love with this product -- truly makes your skin glow
love the way it makes my skin feel post wash
i feel better about myself since i've started using this
i love how my skin feels after use
definitely a new product added to my beauty routine
i like this product a lot
it felt great going on
have looked past because the overall result has been truly amazing for me
finally gave me something that works great on my face
does what it says and very well!
my face feels so good
works really well to get all the leftover makeup
really great for winter too!
a great way to make sure that i really remove as much makeup as i can
absolutely hated it- mostly because i hated how greasy my skin felt afterward
really like this cleanser.
i think it works really well.
works for me in both way, no complains
i think it does a great job of removing eye makeup as well as my long wearing foundation
'm sure i could use it as my only cleanser in a pinch
i just feel like i need to see suds in order for my face to feel totally clean
i just love this stuff.
i like how easy it is to use
i like the feel and smell of this.
once you do your skin feels great
this feels so good on the skin!
so this is step one to do the job
it really works to remove makeup.
however i never found a decent oil cleanser that made my skin feel amazing
something i would definitely repurchase time
i always thought i had washed my face extremely well
love everything about this
i don't know what i was doing my whole life before this product?
its nice i like it i will continue to use it
it still gets my makeup off well- face makeup for sure
it also makes my skin feel good
so glad i spent my money on it
it really does thoroughly remove make up
i felt like it wasn't truly removing all my makeup
this stuff gets everything off my face
i love this whole line
just to see if it really did take everything off
am-my eyes are looking really good
a consultant sold me on this telling me what i really needed was a daily eye cream
it really has helped the dark spot
i can see a big difference
you can definitely see more of the lid when i use this product
the great thing about this product is what it's made without
night i really saw a difference
i think personally as a young 22 year old i can't see how this product would help with an older person who wants to tighten up their skin
i took one star off because i didn't really see a difference in terms of doing its job as an "anti-aging" serum
i really like it
i really love it!
she always inspired me at an early age to take care of my skin
my skin has really started changing lately
but it is working for me.
i will always take care of my skin if i plan to wear makeup
i feel it is a good time to start an anti aging regimen
this got kid of them very quickly
i never worried about caring for my skin
i do love the way it makes my skin feel
i am definitely enjoying mine while it lasts
this has really changed the texture of my skin.
it makes my skin feel good
i really do like the way this makes my skin feel
thought it only fair
t's always so difficult for me to find a great moisturizer to address both of the areas of my face
it really is great for all skin types too.
we all know how amazing hyaloronic acid is for hydration
i don't feel it on my skin
this stuff works so well.
immediately i could feel a difference in my skin
my whole family uses it
i am in love with this stuff!!!
makes it feel revived
first off, i really like this product.
it smells really weird.
again i really love it
it looks kinda dull in the am
makes me you look like you had a full night of sleep
the moment you put it on you feel
im always trying new things
the smell is also probably the best thing that i have ever smelled without being too perfumy
first off i love this stuff.
i got over it rather quickly when i realized just how amazing this made my skin feel
this mask shocked me how much of a difference it left on my skin
it actually really works
my skin had sooo much texture
i really think its improving my skin.
this really does hydrate my face like nothing else
i found it definitely works on me
so -1 star from me
i love the way my skin looks
definitely recommend this product!
it's very thick though in a good way
it hard to find products that really help hydrate my skin without making it greasy too
i love how smooth it is
i actually really like this mask.
this is a nice mask to give my skin a break from all those
been using this for years now it's definitely my holy grail
idk if it really improves my skin though.
like i have to stop myself from wearing this every night because i like it that much
my skin loves this stuff
makes your skin feel new
i am definitely buying another bottle
i would still wear it all the time just for it's amazing smell
my boyfriend actually looks forward to me wearing it before bed because he loves the smell of it too
they all loved this product too
i think it's because i'm getting older
after just one night was amazed at how much moisture was in my skin
oh, and it smells really good!
along with everything else, it smells sooo good!
this stuff is a necessity for winter.
i would definitely recommend if you have very dry skin
its pretty obvious when i wear makeup
it works for me
a nice smell once you get used to it
to start off let me just say that it's really hard for me to find products that don't break me out all across the board
not even kidding my face felt so smooth
my skin was so dried out i was physically self conscious about what i looked like with make up on
'm not sure if that's made a difference in how well it's working
this definitely has helped
this has seriously done wonders for my skin.
this thing is pretty darn amazing
this stuff has honestly saved my skin.
let me tell you, it is amazing.
well my skin anyways.
i love how it makes my face feel the following morning
am really bad about picking at my skin
my skin is looking a whole lot brighter.
i feel like it also helps keep my face clear from acne
i feel that my skin gets really smooth when i glide this on
i used up the whole thing
i find it a nice treat for myself before bed
this product definitely did the job
love this product would definitely recommend.
worked pretty well didnt clear up everything
there is just something i like about this product it is really healing to dry skin
really suggest buying the whole system
i really liked this creme
it definitely does what it claims
i think it smells so good
i feel this product can work for 99% of the skin types
this eyecream is really good for those with very dry undereyes like mine
then i realized this thing is great for taking off all my face makeup
this thing does wonders i'm just mad it cost soooo much
i definitely recommend this product
really love this cleanser: it takes all of my makeup off
however i feel like it doesn't really help with my breakouts
i really like it
this was a pretty good cleanser while i used it
i really wanted to love this cleanser
love the way this feels going on
it's definitely help make a difference
someone who has always taken care of their skin
this product is just ok for me
that said, it feels pretty good.
it does smell a bit funny at first
my skin always looks so glowy
just make sure you use it day
which is a little weird
my skin was always red
gentle on the skin yet does a great job getting the job done
i feel like i go through it fast
my skin feels really smooth.
little goes a long way makes my fave feel great.
i love the way it feels
this is a great cleanser once i tried it my skin felt like it could breathe
my skin definitely feels softer after using it
i really like this foam.
after looking at all the reviews about this cleanser i really wanted to try this
i don't know whether this cleanser is a bit too strong for me
to me this really st
i felt like my skin could feel more clean
add my love for this product to everyone else's.
tried this bc i'm always on the lookout for a good cleanser
this stuff does it all.
love the way my skin feels/looks after.
will definitely be re-ordering this stuff!
this has done wonders for me
the only thing i like better about the perfectly clean is that you can use it on eye makeup
it lathers on my face really well
my only negative is that my liquid foundation has a really hard time going on on top of this product
i am getting complements like crazy--different from any before i started using this
i can feel this product working on my skin.
it really freaking worked!!!!
definitely feel it gives a 'blur' to lines/wrinkles
what i've really noticed a difference in are the lines on my neck
'm only giving it 4 stars
this stuff really does work for redness
when i saw that it truly does relieve my skin
i really do like the product
my complexion has looked so nice that i haven't even had to wear foundation
it left my skin feeling nice
defintely going to continue with it for 4 more nights
i feel like it helps everything absorb better into my skin because when i wake up my skin is so soft
have definitely changed my mind about it
i knew it was something special
it's not just that my skin looks great in the morning
ok... lets get real for a second.
truly the only mask that i feel like makes a difference
i really started to feel like everything was mostly a waste of money until i tried this
'm always trying new ways to keep it hydrated
when i use this stuff
i feel like this is a great replacement that does more
i recently have experimented with the coconut oiltrend going around although it has worked very well on my hair my skin did not like it at all backstory on my skin i have very bad eczema
i feel it works very well
i've never used any product that left my skin as great as this mask
overall very good product that i would personally buy
love how my skin feels.
loved the product a lot!
love to try new things
okay this stuff is amazing!
this mask really helped my face's dewyness
to be honest i feel like i had my 8 hours of sleep
i feel good about putting this on my skin- that's really what it's about
let me just say it is amazing i wake up with super hydrated skin
it has helped my skin feel
makes my skin feel like i had just stepped out of the shower
i mix them myself based on what i think my skin needs that morning
my face has gotten really oily recently especially around my t-zone
i also really like the texture.
i really love this product
makes the skin look so clear
i've found it makes a real
my eyes do not look s tired
it is amazing that i actually get results from this
i am definitely a believer.
i am sure it had worked really well
my skin has never looked or felt better
this is the only serum i ended up loving it really does hydrate my skin only complain is it runs out so fast it can get a little pricey repurchasing every month other than that it's a great product
this stuff really does hydrate your face amazingly
is really great for those who cannot afford to use ampoules everyday
i've found it makes a real
i definitely noticed my skin
you could really tell in my face
this product is really a good product to shape my face
thought to myself yeah right this isn't going to do anything
it really really works
i can see a good difference
i can tell it hydrates my skin really well
it feels like it really plumps my skin up
how my skin feels after using it
i really like the way this feels on my skin when i first apply it
okay now that the important part is out of the way
you can definitely tell that my skin is alot tighter than it used to be
obviously not every product works w/ every type of skin
it's always good to change it up
this really does what it says
i really like the results
lately my skin has really been advertising that fact
this will definitely be kept as part of my beauty routine
you can feel it tighten a little so using moisturizer
it definitely helps my makeup stay put
it's definitely improved the lines i get under the eyes
i pretty much just use this in my laugh lines because my foundation just always seems to accentuate them
this stuff really is amazing
i really do love it
i don't really have issues with firmness
you know how great your skin feels after doing your favorite mask?
i love the way it makes my skin feel
i dont really have issues with firmness
my cheeks have always been naturally full
everyone can look a little "tired"
see a real difference in my skin.
that is saying a lot
one of my eyes has been getting this annoying "crep"
it feels pretty tight at first
i like that because i feel it is working
i definitely felt my skin was smoother for multiple hours after applying the product
when i first tried this product it kinda weirded me out
thought "hmmm do i really need this in my routine?"
it was then i realized what a difference this really makes on my 35 year old skin
this product does not feel tight at all on your skin
it really does firm my skin.
when you put it on you can actually feel your face tightening
good stuff though and will rebuy!
just loved the hydrating feeling of it so much that i had to go back to get the full size
i really like the way my face looks
it smells really pretty
the sephora consultant i spoke too told me that a serum was definitely the way to go
my skin really looks younger
my skin feels so amazing when i use this.
i definitely recommend this product.
personally, i like that.
that's when the scent really got to me
the sample i had issues with smelled strongly of icyhot so no idea what happened there
i love how this feels on my skin
treatment i wasn't quite convinced thought until my son developed a rash on his elbows
you should get this stuff it works
so this is definitely a good buy
people compliment me on my skin constantly
my skin just loves it
at the same time it was really refreshing
even though i was feeling pretty tired
so this maybe one reason that it seems to be working for me as i clean my skin with a salicylic acid product beforeh
i love everything about this.
it sure looked like i did before i used this serum
it's definitely an a+ product
that's a pretty big deal
those two products together just worked perfectly for my skin type
however, love this stuff.
and i do all of those things for myself at home.
i love the way this really does what it says!
also no greasy after feel
thought my skin had to get use to it
i like this stuff.
you go through the product pretty quick
when i am not feeling in the mood to do everything
love the way it made my skin feel
is just what i need to tone
i really love it!!!
it really takes off the makeup
i feel like it's really working for my skin
my skin definitely doesn't feel as dry
definitely a must have in my beauty process
it's really frustrating because i love it
it is nice to use sometimes
i really appreciate the lack of scent
your skin actually starts to thank you
i swear it helped even out my skin tone as well.
you get a lot for the price
it really helps getting my eye makeup off.
it calms me down and makes me feel so content.
i love how it is so gentle but so clarifying.
it really seems to get rid of all my makeup
i found this product too good not to
definitely part of my skin care routine now.
initially made fun of it
usually things like this never feel like they've cleansed enough
there was some stuff on the pad
i like this stuff.
it really takes off a lot of impurities
each time i use this it feels like my skin is br
my face does not feel tight afterwards
i am most definitely a fan of this product!
i kid you not when i say this product is amazing.
everything hurts my eyes.
wanted to try something different
honestly very rarely repurchase things
i do think my skin is firmer
i love how comfortable this is
you get a good amount of product for the money
especially how my skin feels in the morning.
size of this there are many things about this i adore
it is definitely firmer.
i personally love this stuff.
this stuff really works.
it makes my skin feel so amazing
i really loved how soft this made my face!
i always regret it
nothing has givin results from the very first use like this cream has
my sister asked me if i had my eyes done because she said they looked much more open
you can feel it sitting on your face
i can definitely see a difference in how refreshed my skin looks in the mornings
anything that helps my skin look
your skin will feel like velvet the very next morning
im already starting to see good results
love the feel of it on my skin.
i really like it.
i feel good every time i use this mask.
i got this because my skin was starting to feel dull
i instantly feel like my skin is 5 years younger when i apply it
loved the way my skin felt in the am
i do love how my skin feels
whether it really helps to lift
it definitely felt different from a regular cream mask
i think it helps alot if you massage it in really well before you sleep
i really like it!
when i feel my face in the morning
my skin just feels amazing after having it on all night
i feel that the overall health of my skin
feels so soothing going on
the next day he commented on how great my skin looked
it has done wonders for my skin.
makeup look really good
am definitely proactive when it comes to my skin
i made my purchase just loved the come out my skin feels great
my skin just felt good
it made my face feel great
then i felt what others wrote about it being slippery/greasy
told me it was like a baby's bum
i went to wash it off and my skin feels amazing.
i'd definitely recommend them both
when i really checked out the jar a realized it was actually a really generous amount
i personally find it really pleasant
when i smile especially
feel like this definitely softened it
now i don't feel like i need to
if i make really crazy expressions for a long period of time
i know this product helps me keep my skin looking young
can really see the difference
i truly saw a difference in my crows feet
this product really works
i know, i know too young to worry about wrinkles.
i feel like the '11' area
it really looked a lot better
i've had really sunk in under eyes lately so that's where i targeted it
love it, i can see an improvement in my skin!
love this stuff and it really works.
good things come to those who wait :
have always taken good care of my skin
this product has really helped plump the skin
worth the $ if you're wanting younger looking skin
i can honestly say that this product really really works
with that being said i love this product
i spend a lot of time laughing
this product is really working on them
this stuff does a really good job of minimizing the
love the way it makes me skin look
i am only 21 and have very deep smile lines!
that always makes a difference for me
it really bothered me.
i wanted to treat myself
wow thats just too much
got one for my mom and we are both obsessed!
i can feel the difference when i touch the skin above my eyes
you do feel the tightening right when you apply it
this product definitely does fit that claim
made my skin feel great so far!
i can definitely say it helped me clear up my skin
the pump is pretty bad.
it feels so good when i'm washing my face.
i've never had my skin feel so clean
i love this and would definitely recommend.
i wish the packaging was better than this because i really like this cleanser
the pump doesn't work really well
almost nothing would come out even though i knew there was still product left in the bottle which was really frustrating
i just kept thinking
this stuff is honestly a god send!
i love that i can feel it working
it works good, but i will stick to the mask.
i really do like this!
this really helps give definition towards your entire complexion
decided to try this because i have heard such great things about glam glow products
the really clean feeling
recently i was having really bad breakouts
i also don't think it will work well with my clarisonic
i keep coming back to this one because of how good it is for my acne
i would always get a few pimples here
it seriously sucks when i already look like a student
does foam up quite a bit
i started using this stuff
it makes my skin look really fresh
months of not using that i started breaking out in really bad cystic acne i tried everything i could think of
makes my skin feel great without overdrying
not quite with everyday use
it always made my skin feel clean without being overdry
this stuff works wonders
that really did work
nothing worked very well
my skin has never looked or felt better
she really loves this
i also got one for myself
so when i tried this cleanser i really just thought it would be like everything else before
not good enough to get my skin back on track
love this cleanser it makes my skin feel so great
my skin has never felt so smooth
so anything is really an improvement
it definitely brings things to the surface
makes my makeup look so good
your skin will feel a little too clean after
so you definitely have to use your fingers to put it on
which i actually like a lot
my skin felt a lot smoother
i would definitely recommend giving it a shot.
i really like this cleanser.
this cleanser deff changed my face for the better
that's what we need to clear up our skin
i always get compliments on my skin.
it's still pretty full that's my one complaint
this product works great especially if you have extremely large pores i kidd you not over niht my pores shrunk amazing i will continue to use glamglow i love this stuff
tingy if you like that feeling
i like how it helped with the texture of my skin.
making it really feel like you're getting into your pores
i feel like like i can really say i have tried everything
remember every skin type is different may not work for everyone
it really cuts the oil
so excited to find a cleanser that does such wonders for my skin
i think just moving some things to the surface
i really like this product.
have to say it's quite amazing
my only complaint is that the pump is awful!
the wash makes me want to be a better person
this is definitely my one
i meant it when i said this cleanser is a game changer
because i am an aesthetician i have tried so many cleansers in my career
i know everyone is different
you need about 2-3 drops it blends in so nice .
my skin has never been so beautiful
i honestly was very sceptical about putting oil on my face because i was scared to break out
it smells so good that i want to wear it like perfume
it is also very good if teh skin is tired of all the make up
after the first day i found myself really liking it
friends frequently tell me now that i smell really good when i'm not wearing perfume
as i have combo skin i didnt really want to use an oil
got this after hearing a lot of good things about clarins products
i really like this oil.
it's also hard to travel with
use a different cleanser i always regret it because my skin just isn't the same
the consistency is just right
it is definitely not greasy
you can only feel your skin left very fresh
i really like this product
it works really well at removing makeup.
i think i got a bad bottle
i really like this cleanser.
the way i think about treating my skin
and it will thank you for it.
have fallen in love with the way this makes my skin feel
definitely a repurchase for me!
my skin routine feels like a luxury rather than a chore because of the great feeling products that smell great too
i don't use it unless i feel like my skin needs a really good deep clean
really work it into the skin
this is definitely that
my skin seems to like this product
first it's not too harsh and smell is so amazing.
really does feel clarifying
i've really been enjoying this
i really enjoy this cleanser.
i wanted a morning cleanser for when my skin wasn't amazing
i still really enjoy it
this gives me just the right amount of hydration
i really do love this product
everyone always tells me i smell so good
it makes your skin look like you are 19 years old
it's done a pretty good job
i really like it
i really like this moisturizer it makes my skin feel great
i really love this moisturizer.
i've always had issues finding a moisturizer right for my skin
i tried this stuff
it has done wonders for my skin
i feel comfortable going out without makeup
it is really nice, though.
i loved this so much i went back
i really recommend both
i wondered if it would work alright in the winter
never really felt the need to moisturize a lot
really helps to clear my skin
i love how it sets my makeup
i really love this moisturizer.
really adds some moisture to my face
i love the way it makes my skin feel during the spring/summer/fall
you really should give it a try
honestly this stuff is this much better
definitely a great product that just adds a certain something to your skin
i really love it ever since i started using it my makeup looks way more amazing
i really like this product.
definitely would recommend for you to try out.
nothing has really seemed to help my acne.
i've always loved the philosophy line.
my face still feels amazing in the morning
5oz jar to make sure i really loved it
not to mention it smells really good too!
i love this stuff so much.
this stuff is so amazing
i feel so alive my skin is now glowing
everyone is already completing how good my skin is healing definitely sticking to philosophy's products
i got to say i love this stuff
you don't need much for your skin to feel amazing
she really likes it
it makes my skin look great- even tone
makes it look like i actually got a decent amount of rest the night before
i really like this moisturizer.
i always have trouble finding a great moisturizer to use
the way it makes my skin feel
it has worked really well under my makeup
feels light which i also love
finally a cream that truly works for me!!
i don't know how people are saying it smells good
made my skin feel a lot healthier
i definitely like it
love this product what a difference it makes
i feel like my makeup goes on well over it
it is truly hope in a jar!
the way it feels on the skin
i am curious to see what i think of it in the summer when the weather changes
like i'd actually gotten some sleep
she love the way that it treat her skin
make your skin feel
i love what this has done to my skin.
it obviously smells better
that's a good thing because i loved the original
i love the way my skin feels when i use it
this product is definitely not like its competitors
but this one... wow!
the next morning applications my skin feels so good
i taken very good care of my skin all of my life
i really like this moisturizer.
i am generally a big fan of philosophy
if your born with the dark circles you better just accepted or have some sort of surgery because nothing will totally take them away
with time i definitely noticed a difference
my skin looked so much more healthier because my dark circles really made me look dead lol
it also really brightens the area
not sure how well it brightens because i'm old
it's also pretty high for the size of container you get
anyway i'm glad i got this because it feels hydrating
my eyes have a nice taut look to them
i can honestly say i've seen a huge difference in my fine lines
this is a great one for someone who wants to prevent wrinkles
it looks like the feeling is consistent
it feels nice going on.
other philosophy products really work well
honestly i liked it for my eyes
feel in love instantly
i really like this cleanser
just love this one
this stuff is magic.
it's just so nice to use
for me one is just fine
i really liked it
did not feel like doing my nighttime thing
even all the hard to get off eye stuff
what a great whim it was
it definitely breaks down makeup very well
i am not easily impressed with cleansers because i wear a long lasting foundation that is hard to take off
pretty much an all-rounder.
i think it does the job well
i really do love this product.
it has done wonders for my skin.
then everything gets so hard
i though that was doing a pretty good job
i really think it's helping get extra dirt
i've always struggled with finding a cleanser that actually removes all my make up
i genuinely look forward to taking my make up off at the end of the day because of how great my skin feels
now i don't feel a thing
feel special when you open it
however, it's definitely out of my price range.
i really like it
i never thought i would found a product that would make me look at the mirror all day because i just love how mi skin looks
it's always nice when i find something new that works with sensitive skin
i really like this cleansing oil because it softens my skin in a big way
as long as you do it as part of a two-step system like i have been doing it works beautifully
i've always been scared to try cleansing oils
i am pretty full faced
i really actually look forward to washing my face b/c of how fun
so was worried it would feel heavy or would not clean my skin
i will say my skin felt pretty darn soft after it
if you do use oil cleansers then i feel this one is a good one
since i am on a budget i wanted to find something with great reviews
i especially love this for when i travel
if this keeps working like this
i honestly look forward to taking my makeup off at the end of the night because of this product
i definitely recommend this product because it has helped my face with getting over my acne
it also works really well to take off makeup
i swear it feels like 10
i always feel better after this cleanse
i didn't even know how to mentally process these results
so with that being said i had the bright idea to use the tatcha one
it does a pretty good job at removing the makeup
no matter what cleanser i use i feel tight
really gets the junk off my face
i love it and recommend it to everyone.
really gets all the makeup off.
i am okay with that
this is seriously a good cleanser!
i really loved this
this helps me a lot
i really love this cleansing oil.
i feel like it's great for dry skin.
it's always fun to try something new.
it really does an amazing job at getting rid of makeup at the end of the day
this stuff is like magic.
this stuff is so fast.
i think this would be good for both oily
it feels nice going on
my face never feels greasy
just might bring myself to splurge
the sensation felt quite different
i felt it got off all my other makeup as well really fast
i found something that works really great
my skin hasn't looked or felt this good my entire life
not with an oily feel at all which is something i was really hesitant about before trying this product
this product has done wonders for my skin.
i am so in love with this product!
do i love this stuff
i can always tell a difference in my complexion when i skip this step in particular
skin care industry has really done a number on my skin
you really only need two drops on your face
i see lots of people complaining about it
this stuff definitely works well
since i tried it my face feels so smooth
definitely felt the hydration afterwards
i decided to go with this oil because of the good reviews
i really like this oil
like i said i'm always shopping at sephora
you get a lot of product
let my co- worker see/feel how soft this product made my skin immediately
i definitely think this is a nice
i will definitely be buying the whole line
alone it was okay, very nice thick consistency.
i love how it makes my skin feel
when you put it on your face you feel nothing
feels so good on your skin
i found this out the hard way when i thought this was like a serum
i really enjoy this oil!!
i really like this!
which i learned about the hard way
i really love this oil.
i also really love the smell!
i can't believe how great this stuff works like
i get compliments about my glowly skin
yes, it is pricey but has really changed my skin.
i can honestly feel my skin saying "thank you" when i apply it
i really love how this feels
always scared to try one because i have combo breakout prone skin
i can feel the pure oil being absorbed that's how good this is
my skin looks great even on those days after my time of the month when my skin usually looks awful
wanted something that would give me the extra hydration
for someone who's always been really oily i think using this has really helped my skin to decrease the amount of oil it produces
just depends on how my skin is feeling that day
to me it smells a bit like the
feels really good in my skin, like honey.
smell really nice like nuts
i feel like my skin does absorb this one really well compared with the other 2
with the little amount you need i am pretty sure it will last me all winter
i don't really care for the smell
this is my favourite find in a very long time!
this stuff really helps calm my skin down when i make it cranky by eating too much junk
it took me a good month to believe that this product was working
felt like an beauty oil should feel
thank you i really appreciate this :-)
but for now i can see and feel small changes!
i feel like it's a nice break for my skin because is 100% all natural marula oil
your skin will definitely thank you in the morning so smooth
it makes my skin feel amazing
you will thank me.
2 drops is enough for my whole face
which have honestly made my skin feel amazing
it makes my face feel like a baby's bottom
i really hope these great results continue.
i really like how it feels
how it makes my skin look in the morning
my skin immediately felt nice
my skin has never looked this amazing!
what i like most is that this heals your skin with just one use
my skin hasn't looked or felt this good my entire life
this stuff really works.
which is kinda a miraclei loved it
they are really disappearing
i made the switch after a particularly difficult breakout that left me feeling like a teenager again
it makes my skin so clear
it sure has helped my skin a lot
i felt like the texture i had on my skin was starting to even out
good thing that i did
you only really need one pump for the whole face
when i was younger i had really bad acne
which left me with lots of really big pores
my texture definitely got smoother
my plan was to swatchety swatch makeup to my heart's content to make myself feel better
have been dealing with awful
which is really funny
i still get a zit here
can tell a good difference in the size of my pores
a half pumps you want to make this stuff last
seriously- buy this stuff.
for the first time in a long time i feel totally comfortable not wearing any sort of foundation
this product has really helped with my texture!
after using it i always wake up with my skin feeling it's best
not knowing when it is going to be empty makes me a little nervous
i definitely noticed a difference in my skin complexion the very first day i used this
this product makes my face look so young
i feel great not wearing makeup.
honestly my pores are almost gone now
it really helps with those chest lines too!
i always notice a difference when i travel since i don't bring this big bottle with me usually
it's just really really expensive!
this product was something that i just sort of looked at
was telling me how good my skin looked
i can see a difference in my skin
i will be sure to always keep a bottle of this in my nightst
i can definitely see a difference in my skin
sad thing is that this is a bit much for me to purchase
like but it works so good.
ahahha give it a try girls/guys.
like a lot of others here
if anything it makes me feel like it's truly working
i really like this product
my skin looks so good
i felt like my skin looked so good yesterday that i left the house w/o foundation on
really couldn't get over how good my skin looked
i hate spending a lot of money on skin care
i can feel my skin is was smooth instantly
this product certainly deserves one
just know that it takes time to see the best results
glowing as in i never knew my skin could look like this
my skin definitely did
that has nothing on this stuff
it really does work!!!!
my foundation goes on like a dream
my skin has never felt softer
if you are thinking of getting this, do it!!
i would definitely recommend this!
this stuff really works well for my skin
i felt that my bumps
really liked the results
this stuff is an essential for me now.
good things to say about this
definitely a must buy if you have skin texture issues like me
only cons are that it hasn't done anything for my fine lines or wrinkles really
felt like it really changed my breakout cycle
i felt good about my skin
i didn't feel like it was doing much on the anti-aging front
just knew there had to be something
so adding something in
this product makes me feel like my skin is dewey
it's taken me so long to find something that actually works for my skin
it does a great job of taking off my makeup after a long day
i really like it
for someone who is always on the go this is a great option for when you want a cleanser that is great for your skin unlike many stripping bar cleansers
i love the feel of my skin using this product
the one thing that i will say is that your face may feel a little dry afterwards
it was quite the opposite for me!
i heard great things about the pekee bar
definitely give it a try!
you get a lot of use out of one bar
your face may feel a bit tight after
i love the way it makes my skin feel.
i feel as though my skin looks brighter
i feel like they're very similar aside from that.
this product has done wonders for my skin
i just wise it didnt feel so dry
y i don't feel bad using this twice to really get the makeup off
it's good value for the money because my bar still looks new
it really helps even things out
with continued use it really does help clear your skin
a lot of products break me out
my skin feels so nice
my skin really seems to like it.
that is ok with me
you definitely get used to it
.... it's way too good.
it also works really well with my foreo.
i feel like they leave behind a residue
it actually feels really nice on my skin
did a pretty good job of removing my makeup
i take my skin care routine very seriously
love everything from this line!
i always have that problem
it's still going strong
you can feel the skin tighten after
which i really appreciate
it just has not been very smooth
is now getting really smooth
obviously my skin likes it.
i want this amazing soap all for myself
safe to say i really like it!
this product definitely met them
i feel that everyone must try it
it's healing my face very well
now i can say for sure this pekee bar is amazing
it has been a fantastic change to my routine that i could not be happier about now
i think this is why my skin is doing so well!
she can't stop telling me how wonderful it is
i really like this
my skin never looks irritated afterwards
none of them seem to work good for me.
just wanted to give everyone a little clarification
they make me feel beautiful
i really wanted to try this soap
i've always hated the feeling they leave.
i definitely want to try the other bar soap in this br
it just makes it feel really clean
this bar really cleans
my skin truly has a better appearance.
loves it just the same as me
this is what i wanted for my skin
that made me freak out.
mpressed with how they work with my skin
this stuff is so good!!!
definitely give it a try!
definitely see a difference with texture when i apply my makeup
just goes to show that everyone's skin is different
you can tell that it is getting stuff done
luckily this product has none of those bad ingredients
i noticed that using ph balanced product really does change the skin
use that to really get my skin clean
the first time i used it i thought "yeah right
i wanted to buy the whole line
okay real talk: i have crazy combination skin.
i really enjoy the fact that the bar has no harsh scent
i feel like this is such a quality product
my skin really loves it
my makeup really looks better when i use it
it's just so good
it's really been a miracle product for me
i truly see the difference in my skin
i definitely feel like my dark spots from acne are diminishing after using these products
it's so good for my skin & i love it.
it makes my skin so
this is definitely too harsh to use every day
i can really tell that my skin does not feel as tight as it did when i would step out of the shower
it sure feels good
maybe not noticing anything is a good thing.
go look at myself in my mirror
that works for me
first time i feel like to stock up stuff for this as i'm very fickle
makes my skin feel really clean
i would definitely recommend it :-)
i really love this
as for the product, i really love it.
i break out like crazy
my face has never felt so clean
my skin hasn't looked or felt this good in ages.
it really helps with tough blackheads
trust me- it is
they are both so amazing
the bar is not very big
the ph balance is what makes this so special
this isn't really going to give you that quenching feeling
it has done for me what it claims.
i feel like my skin just drinks this up.
have tried pretty much everything we carry
it really did make a difference- finally!
just give it a try... i'm sure you will love it!
got some for myself also
nothing has ever made my skin look like this.
which makes me hard to impress
you get quite a bit
my skin used to look so tired
i really love this oil.
this stuff has made my skin look like porcelain.
i feel like i have this lovely 'glow' even without make up on
it is also doing a great job to lighten my acne scars
i really love this product
i love the way my skin feels after applying this!
thought do i really need this?
it must have been something else that triggered the breakout because this is a beautiful product
what it has done for me
i love this i really wish when i got my #freesample it was just a bit more
that day my skin felt
i really did like the feel of this on my skin.
it does make my 53 years old skin feel like
anytime in between just because i love how it makes me feel
it does a pretty good job at cleansing the skin
it smells so nice there's a lot of product
pretty scent that puts me in a good mood every time i wash my face
has made my face feel soooo soft
it feels really nice when you first put it on your face
leaves your face feeling so nice
i actually kind of like the smell
recommended to everyone i know
everybody who tried loves it
leaves my skins so nice afterwards every time
i love how this really foams
it makes me feel like it is working better somehow
instantly felt in love with it
it is really nice at not leaving your skin feeling dry
not to the point that you feel your skin is gonna dry out
it gets the job done
to me, i like it.
the consistency is so nice that i just st
my make up is sitting so beautiful
i get so many compliments on my skin with i'm not wearing make up
my skin felt really clean
hopefully it continues to feel this way!
it's going to take something really special to replace this from my daily routine
i liked that as well
feel like it's also helping
i hate that tight feeling.
literally makes your face very smooth
then go in with my dermabrush to really get all of the dirt
my skin felt truly ready for the day
my face feels good for half an hour or so not putting anything up
switching to this cleanser has really helped
'm careful what i put on my face
it cleared up all my problem areas right away even though i'm not keen on skin products with fragrance it does smell nice
i really believe it's a great product no matter what some reviews have said
not so much that i feel it is stripping my skin
alcohol is so horrible for your face
i'll use it just here
really gets my face clean
has definitely helped my skin look clear
i probably shouldn't let hiw awesome this face wash is
i really like this cleanser!
i think it helped a bit with my redness
has a really nice feel
it seems to be good for all skin types
definitely recommend to try it out!
i love how it makes my face feel clean
as i don't feel like they really cleanse my skin well
i want my face to feel clean
there's always a small voice in my head that says
this has really helped to get rid of the acne
i think this is it.
that cool refreshing scent is really what gets me
it's works very well on my skin
rub it in really well
i love everything about it
this stuff is so gentle, i love it.
i really enjoy this cleanser
what i love about this is my skin feels full of moisture
i don't really have acne
still make my skin feel tight
takes off my makeup pretty well.
it does really well removing everything else
really gets everything off the first time
in other words my skin is very frustrating to work with
this stuff is bomb for my skin
this product has done wonders for my skin
it's really not great
i found this to be okay for my dark circles
i think it works pretty well
then once your done using this stuff on your face you skin feels hydrated
i really love all in one products.
hasn't really broken me after that
i don't think it has very good make-up removing properties
this stuff really works
it was weird to see my face clean
not feel like that
overall i would buy this again- it makes your skin feel amazing
i really do love this product.
my face feels so loved
i really doubt it
i love it, will definitely repurchase
it gentle because i am so scared of rashing out.
it feels refreshing going on
i think it works really well!
i liked this product a lot
it definitely helped with my puffy under eyes
as a young woman who doesn't always get enough sleep
i found puff off to be a fantastic addition to my "try to look as awake as possible" array of products lol i absolutely loved it
im realistic about these things
if you are tired
it really works at getting my under eyes looking more alert
i forget to put it on people tell me how tired i look
it lets me know this stuff must really be magic
i think they must have put some real thought into this product
i actually really like it
which is a big problem for me especially in the morning
i wanted to try this to see if maybe it works better
for a quick fix this really works for me
i really like this product a lot!
it feels so nice under the eye
the funny thing about the packaging of this product is it makes you either love it or hate it
it really actually works.
i really like to use this in the morning as an under eye primer
the product itself tingles so you know it's working
that gets the metal tip really nice
it also makes my concealer go on like a dream
this product helps if im going out after work
believe me this works!
take your time with the iron as it really helps.
it certainly hides the look of it well
this stuff has really helped brighten my under eyes
this stuff is pretty close
works wonders for me.
i feel like it's a little bit like an illuminator
your skin just isn't looking fresh under the eyes i think it works very well
it made my eyes look instantly better
it really does make a difference
works very well and feels good on my eyes.

it was not only fun
if that makes sense
i got this product because i liked the idea of having a little bit of luxury on my face

i kid you not right after my skin looks amazing
this has done a 360 on my skin.
it has left me in awe that my skin could ever be this clear
i can see this is going to help a lot
it's also a great way to scare my dog
i like to think of it as it working to get all the dirt out of my pores
'm excited to try his other stuff
hopefully i can remind myself to use more often.
i really like this mask.
while i like them all
my skin has literally never looked so good!!
it somehow always feels cool to the touch
really makes me skin feel less clogged
i feel i had to with this one
my skin feels so good afterward
but this mask really is truly something special.
just thought i'd let you guys know!
sulfur in it which you would think would be great
my face felt great after i used it all over even though i'm starting to wonder if i have a little rosacea because my cheeks are always red compared to my forehead
just see what you think about it
nothing was working on my skin.
man does it really help my combo skin
i really like this

i really love this.
this stuff changed the game for my skin.
it felt like my face got a much needed hug.
i love how it tingles a little
it looks really awful while it is on your face
i definitely recommend this product.
perfect for a girls night or just any day you feel like pampering yourself
it's also definitely brighter
you feel really silly wearing a black mask

i like it a lot.
i also don't like how hard it is to remove

it really decongests my pores
it never turns hard
in fact my skin is looking
i can remember after i used it thinking my skin felt really hydrated
i remember the next morning thinking my skin looked amazing
over all my complexion always looks clear
honestly i have kinda sensitive skin
this mask really addresses everything.
you never feel like your skin is cracking when you smile or move your face around
i just felt like they never worked.
i've heard a lot of good things about this face mask
have to be very careful on what i put on my face
i am not sure if it works since my breakouts are from deep under the skin
i love how my skin feels
it really brings out everything from my pores.
i really enjoy using this product.
especially those days where i have really bad breakouts
i would definitely recommend!

the less "tingy" feeling i felt
it is really cleansing

so make sure you follow with a good moisturizer
i like the smell of this as well.
am pretty sure this is the product that saved my skin
he or she will definitely want to follow up with a very good moisturizer especially in the winter months
it definitely is better for people with oily/combo skin
my skin feels exactly right after using it
my combo skin really took well to this
the only reason why i gave it 4 stars is because this soap is very strong that it really dried out my face
but this bar is definitely a big win!

i think i'm gonna have to have surgery to get kid of those babies
this product really did work for me
this one really works
i can honestly see a huge difference
this eye gel does everything it says it will.
i gave it only four stars though because i find in the winter it is not very hydrating
the moment you put it on you can feel a difference- i've never had a product deliver such quick results
i just got it :
it really works, i've seen results right away.
...it works for me!
i definitely see results

my hubby of 32 years remarked as i stepped out of the shower "did you do something different to your face?
'm excited to see what it can really do for me
it always a pleasure to use
i really like this product.
my face feels sooo good after using it.
this cleasner is definitely different
i do see a nice difference in my skin, though.
definitely trying the others.
would not call it an exfoliator really
i loved the mask so thought why not
have had the skin i've always wanted
admittedly i don't have great skin
the scarring i have to go along with that is pretty bad
i really think you will love this product!
it does make my skin feel a bit tight afterwards
i went through this stuff pretty quick.
it does the job of removing oil which is great when you need to
m not sure why it says this stuff is foamy because it really wasnt at all
m sure it is like that for some people
makes me look forward to cleanig my face
i really like the cleanser
although my skin does feel nicer after using this
i still use it every day since my skin does feel pretty clean with it
really makes my face feel very refreshed.
my skin has been looking so glowy!
i really liked this cleanser.
i feel like this product cleans my makeup very well
i really enjoy this product
i do really love this cleanser
i do think it is a good product
my skin is always red
if you dont like it sephora is great about returns
i really like the texture
i love this stuff i use it every night
always have had milia
think it'd not be a good idea
it does a really good job of removing the rest of my makeup though
it has made my skin look really nice
my face stings like crazy for a good 2 minutes
obviously that has nothing to do with the product itself as my skin is just fine afterwards
it has done my skin wonders
loved how this made my skin feel
because i hear such great things about their products
they've all made my skin feel amazing
still giving it a 5/5 because i love this product
second, my skin looks so so good with this.
i definitely look younger
i feel that this cleanser helped to clear that up
while it is also a great cleanser i feel like the youthcleanse is more gentle
it has definitely helped clear out my skin
washing my face always felt like a chore to me
this one smells sooooo good
you get a lot for the price.
i feel like my skin is a lot healthier since i started using this product
the first thing we looked at were cleansers- i told her i wanted something that wasn't crazy expensive
i loved the way it made my skin feel
the only thing that i am very bummed out about is that this company is not cruelty free
i think i got so excited once i finally found this i totally forgot to check the br
gets the job done
i really enjoy this stuff!
i still get a few pimples here
i picked the thirstycleanse for that very reason
the combination has done wonders for my skin
it seriously looks so glowy
it is definitely not drying at all
i really don't know where to start
everything from the smell to the job it does is just amazing
i really like this cleanser.
okay, so i love this face wash.
makes my face feel so fresh
personally i have really dry skin
my skin has never looked so good.
it feels so good on the skin
sure enough i checked my skin
my skin felt amazing after i used it.
it actually smells really good.
additionally my face feels really soft afterward.
we both love the smell
we both love it.
i really feel like it is getting everything off of my face
i personally enjoy this product a lot
nothing in my 29 years looking an trying new things i never thought i would find something so perfect an easy too use
yes i still get a pimple here
the pimples themselves are different in a good way
this stuff has seriously been perfect for it
mix in a little water so you can really get the foam going because if you apply it directly to your face first
i do love it for days when my skin is starting to feel tight
my boyfriend even commented that my skin felt so soft after i used this
i really like how it smells and feels.
good things about this br
makes my skin feel and look amazing.
it always left me feeling really clean
i also, love the way it feels.
this one does not leave me feeling so tight it hurts to smile before i can follow it up with my moisturizer
i think the smell
the consistency of this product really makes me like it so much
my skin has never felt nor looked so good
i will definitely recommend it to people who have oily skin like myself
almost all always give me a bad reaction as to why i never by high end
always loved the results i got from them
see how i liked it
after hearing great things about this
it takes off my makeup so well
makes my skin feel really good
look that i wanted it to
everyone i recommended to loves it!
she is in love with it just like i am
it really seems to make a difference in my skin
i only have great things to say about this product
really really like it
i love it.it smells really good also
i like the way this leaves my face: smooth
feel in love with this one
i actually really like it
it moisturizes well which is really all i want
they definitely have been dehydrated
i feel like it's really feeding that super sensitive eye area with everything it needs
it turns out she was soooo right
i do feel that my eyes are a little brighter
i think that the skin around my eyes looks smoother
i think it's great for young people who are concerned about their eye health
this good bc the cost is a pretty penny :)
it also made the skin feel really smooth
i love that it sits well under makeup
i feel like this has done a great job in hydrating my skin recently
it really makes the skin under my eyes feel great
that being said, i really like this eye cream.
this cream has really helped
really does seem to help my dark circles
i feel in love with it
i am 52 so my skin is a challenge
i really love it
it made my skin look
it has really changed the texture of my skin
i would get this sample to give it a try because it does smell a little funny
i just think it smells like how i'd imagine all those fruit oils
other than that it's nice!
the smell is a little weird but fully worth it.
those who are upset about the smell are making way too big a deal out of this
i think it took my skin 1week to adapt
now i really enjoy it
i like having ''no smell product'' so this one i think smells like the natural oils that are found in it
i will definitely keep using this
i’m very pernickety when it comes to what i put on my face
something that feels natural so at the end of my day
this stuff works like a miracle
although i love how clean it makes my skin feel
i apply this stuff afterwards
i am definitely a believer.
it isn't really that bad
this product did amazing things to my skin that i was starting to think would never happen
i really like this stuff.
this product has really helped
this product works really well for me
i will always, always use this product.
try it your going to like it.
until i'm pretty sure they changed the formula
i like it and i'll keep using it for sure.
it smells really good too
this made my skin feel good
it smells so good and feels so good on the skin.
i actually really prefer the l'occitane one
this stuff really cleans
gets all of my makeup off while keeping my skin nice
you need very little product to clean face
makes my skin feel amazing
i really like this product
it definitely does a good job dissolving long-wearing foundation
this will be a pretty big change for you
i only need 1 pump to do my whole face.
i feel this one really took all my makeup off even the gel liner
i've always felt like i need some foaming action to truly get my skin clean
never felt like cleansing oils were doing anything for my skin
i really like it
definitely my go to cleanser.
i think it works well
i also really love the feel of it going on
honestly i don't get the strong scent some people have mentioned
'm always freaked out to try new things
m always sceptical about what i use on my face
i decided to give cleansing oil a try because i've heard great things
i felt like i was giving myself a face massage putting it on
it's pretty great for the price you're paying
love how it makes my skin feel afterwards
i really love this product
it really struggles with eye makeup
i am so in love with this product!
this is actually helping to clear out my pores.
no joke- i felt a difference after one day.
she loves how nice it makes her skin feel
i think it makes her look younger
i felt like i have never looked better
very pretty on the shelf at home
well it did i am in love!!!
honestly i love most of them
this one is really a st
still get breakouts here
this guy on the other hand is a godsend!
i'd recommend this to any guy out there for an easy quick evening step before going to bed
i am definitely already a believer
i went to look for something for my pores
you can see how your face gets like a healthy glowy look
trust me i've tried a lot
then gets pimples i think this product is good for that
i would think that if you are young
really love this product.
all in all i really enjoy this product
as an experiment to see if this stuff really worked i washed my face with my origins a perfect world cleanser with my clarisonic first
either way my skin looks so pretty
perfect for days where you don't want to look made up
is also great for days you don't want to wear foundation
i love the way my face looks when i use this.
my makeup has never looked so good!
now i really like it
it really makes my face look gorgeous on days i don't want to makeup
several people were coming up to me telling me what gorgeous skin i have
once you do that you get a nice
i am so in love with this!
i feel like my skin instantly looks smoother
it also feels so good on the skin
just makes my skin look like it did 15 years ago
truly all your skin needs for the day
this stuff did run out fast for me
after using it for awhile i felt that my skin just love it
my skin never looked heathlier
remembered how good my skin can look
i am really in love with this
pretty much everything out there
really happy as it is not as thick as my caudalie moisturizer goes on nicely
definitely my new go to!
it is definitely a brightening
if you really want to stay with the algenist look up qvc
i own stuff from maybe 10 different skin care br
i think i am getting used to it
this stuff really works
seems like this is just the way it is
i am also seeing very tiny white bumps here
my mom said i was getting more
it really works for me
not to the point where you feel like you have something thick on your face
i do think it evened out my skin tone
it feels so good going on
i literally felt like i was glowing because it not only improved the look of my skin
my skin feels really smooth.
i personally think it smells like chocolate
everyone is talking about the smell
so weird that everyone is mentioning it.
i like how my makeup goes on afterwards
this stuff just works really well with my skin
have to say i like how my skin looks
i like how my skin looks
feels after i use it
i always recommend this one
i can honestly tell the difference in my skin's texture
loved how my skin felt at the end of it
i get so many compliments on my skin!!
i honestly think it's made a real difference in the appearance of fine lines
definitely made my skin smoother
everyone has been asking if i'm doing something "different"
it's very nice to me
cream i swear i can feel my skin "working"
that's pretty par for the course with me
hopefully she'll start to feel better about her skin like i have
can feel when touching it
not this one i can really tell the difference in my skin
i loved the way it made my skin feel
my skin looks so d@mn good lately i went out the other morning to run err
that's pretty much all i can say!
day 3 i was already getting "your skin looks great:" comments
i can not believe how smooth my skin feels.
have not found one i liked
that was hard to find
i could tell right away that this stuff was working
my face will be sure to let me know it by breaking out like crazy
this one works for me
i guess it just depends on what is important to you
can say my skin looks really nice
i can tell a huge difference in my skin when using this product
it was very visible but not really anymore.
i can feel it working.
it did pretty well removing my makeup
definitely need to tone afterwards to get it all off
after trying a sample i feel i have finally found a product that truly works for my skin
i personally feel a warming sensation when i apply it to my face
i just think some
thought it would be neat
as a cleanser i really like it
so you look like an oompa loompa
i really really like this
the sl there told me that it had great reviews
while i like it
you do kinda feel it on your skin.
but i think that's what makes it so great.
usually breaking out my skin pretty badly
i find that putting a good amount on your h
i can feel it doing its job with the foaming
made my face feel so fresh
i wanted to get a mask that really brightened by sometimes-dull-looking skin
its really fun to hear it bubbling away on my face
i feel like the mask is really getting to work on my skin
we gotta do something for you
felt like going with this br
i love the way it feels on your skin
that's really my only complaint
i really liked it a lot
the color changes indicating it's working is super great too
this is a great mask if you need a pick-me-up
i can definitely back the clarifying
my skin is already in pretty good shape
the price is pretty good for the amount of product you get
i personally try a lot of facial products because i have the need to find something that works
this is definitely a keeper!
it was really neat to see the blue gel turn into a foam
this stuff does work
definitely keeps my problem areas clear
it definitely made a difference in my
things have definitely improved
this one really amazes me because it workes for my acne in just one night
i still love it
this one really does help
it has helped clear up my skin tremendously
this is definitely the product for me
i liked what it did for my skin
how light it felt
its been pretty bad lately
the first time in my life i feel like the rest of those girls with perfect skin
i wanted to share just my quick thoughts on it
gly gel which did very little for me
but this is my life!
i really like this gel for those times when my skin flares up for no reason
the good thing about this thing is you can put it on your make up
it seems to really help with acne
only bad thing is that the jar is very small
my bf said my skin had never looked better
you know you're onto something good
i still love it
you can obviously tell it improves your face
i really loved it
i still loved it
this definitely is a light
i really recommend this product
this product made my skin look & feel amazing.
i found it instantly just made my face feel amazing the first time i put it on
this stuff has definitely had an effect on it
i believe the big bottle will too
it's not quite as good
i always get 27 or 28.
love the way this looks on my skin!
love that i found this brand here.
i really like this scrub.
nothing works or feels like it
you can most definitely get 2 uses out of one packet
i will always keep this in my arsenal when i want a quick fix for flawless looking makeup
i really like this product- i felt like it definitely tightened my pores
it definitely made my makeup go on smoother
i think it works well
i don't see a huge difference with my skin after using it
definitely helps to wake you up in the morning
the steam really helps it get into my skin
that being said i still enjoy this product because my skin feels very clean
this works alright on its own
your face will instantly feel
definitely try this out!
i really loved this product.
after a couple of uses my i've also noticed that this product really helps with evening my skin tone
it felt so nice on my skin
i really see the difference on my skin
i really do love this product!
this definitely had a learning curve
so finding a good product of any sort for my face is impossible
i swear by this stuff now because it has worked wonders on my skin
it does a great job making my face feel clean
have really seen a difference in my skin
it makes my skin feel nice
this stuff is seriously amazing!
that just means that it's working to just deep in there
see for yourself how good of a job it does
it really makes your skin feel amazing
we are pretty much always told to avoid anything with gritty shells as it can really hurt the skin
this stuff made me turn my back in a long time favorite exfoliator
get this for myself
i get nervous trying new things on my face because don't wanna breakout
naturally i wanted to try this
you get a lot of each
i think that's a good thing
well, that seemed just plain logical to me.
i definitely found it too harsh to use on it's own
always just mix it with water
this is a product that i will definitely keep in my routine
seriously just get it.
you will like the way this feels.
the only downside is you have to use a lot of the product to get a good scrub
i just love this stuff
found it to work really well
definitely love this stuff
i love the way my skin feels after i use this.
i would definitely like to try this
thought it was a strange product
after just one application my face was definitely smoother
you have to get the right consistency
thank you josie for a product well done!
it really works for me
you get a lot of it for your $$
i really like this product line.
i really like it.
it feels so good on my skin
it does a really good job making my skin feel smooth
i really prefer exfoliants that have a fine grain so this feels really good to me
this stuff makes my skin soooo nice
my skin have never felt so smooth
so can the people around me
it works perfectly for me this way
i really love the scent
it just puts me in the better mood when product smells
love it, i always come back.
i really really enjoy this serum.
am never really sold on anything
definitely does not break me out.
i think it helps clear them up
'm a fan for life
my skin actually feels smooth there!
even asked what the heck i had done to smell so weird
i've never really had bad skin.
ok, maybe a little powder but that was all.
this product actually keeps my skin clear.
i still get a pimple here
my skin always has some type of texture to it no matter how clear it is
i love how this makes my skin feel
you find something that works
but this stuff right here is some solid gold.
which i really liked
i can definitely notice a difference.
i really love this product
i must say this stuff is amazing
i can already feel a difference
this stuff changed all that.
lately my face has been breaking out like crazy
definitely use to bring pimples to a head to get ready to pop
it really does feel like i'm at the spa
it doesn't make me feel like i would crack my skin if i were to move a facial muscle at all which is really nice
i really think it targets my pores
i feel like out of all the masks i've tried this one does the best job to clean
i prefer really clarifying masks
texture is so rich it's always fun to use
i will definitely keep buying it.
this stuff may be hard to get
this mask did finish quite fast for me
my friends all wanted to know what i had done to my face the night before
i've always wanted to do a clay mask
feeling like i have skin from my 30's
i love the way my skin feels after i use it.
my skin has never felt so smooth.
i must say this mask smells wonderful too!
i always get compliments on my skin when using it
day for me personally
it feels like an oil
it took me a good 2 weeks see a difference in my skin
what a difference in my skin.
i really don't mind it though
i love how it's making my face look younger!
don't just apply one layer to expect it work really well if u have really dry under eye
it is a texture that goes right in
would try this if you feel like your eyes look tired asap
it was so hard to believe that i wondered if it was my healthier diet
it really does work.
it works quite well and my eyes do look younger.
i also feel my eye area looks brighter
as i continued shopping i noticed that my eye really felt like it was firming
how it actually felt like it was firming
it feels nice and not sting.
i can definitely notice a difference in terms of how my eyes look
this product definitely takes care of lines
i love the texture and how it makes my skin feel.
it sounds like a lot
i don't know how i feel about spending $38 on primer
i look sooo much younger with this stuff.
the way it makes my face feel
here is your miracle
i feel like this primer is kind of basic
it does a great job of keeping my foundation in place for the whole day though even when i touch my face consistently
this really does seem to smooth my skin
i really hope this continues to work.
none of them have really worked well
when its really bad
it makes my face look like i was sleeping beauty
ladies just buy it, trust me you will love it.
it's a really good one
but every other day is a good idea.
it is really light on the face
it smells so good despite having spf in it.
i feel good knowing that my face is protected from the sun every day
my skin has never looked and felt better.
i really love that it has spf 30 to help fight off future wrinkles :
i think it actually helps my make-up go on
i didn't really like the feel of it
so just going on experience with my star rating
for this product i feel the need 2
i've tried so many moisturizer that i liked a lot
i love the way this feels
this product caught my attention because it claimed to be really great for dry eye areas
it's really making a difference
i really love this moisturizer!
it has done wonders for my dark circles!
i like how it feels going on
i like how good around my eyes look after using it for a month
need a really good under eye cream or everyone knows how tired i am
i quite like this product
really wanted something that would hydrate
this product really does the trick
now im going to try all of the products because this one works so well
i really like this balm.
i really love it
made me feel like it was working right away
i don't really need a lot for daily application
also must add how much i am really enjoying f
this line works so well for me
softens under my eyes really well
it feels so good going on.
i think it's a good buy!
it does feel smoother
you will love this whole line
my skin is just weird once it gets use to it it will stop wrking
just to put it right out there, i'm real mad.
just love the results i've been getting
i feel my skin gets used to them
wake up feeling so great
i truly liked it!!
every time i use it i can feel its effects.
it helped me for sure
i find that this stuff is pretty potent
'm going all in for a bottle
made my mom buy some too!
have really loved this product
my skin only really does good with this product when i use it a certain way
i definitely feel like i have wasted a good amount of product
so on it was time to invest in a great skin care system to keep looking youthful
it's an oil obviously
we both love it
my skin has honestly never looked better.
you really feel it doing its job.
it works really well
you are never too young to invest in good products for your skin
even after 12 hours on the plane my skin was still wonderful
as it sounded like exactly what my skin needed
like i said i already have good skin
my skin seems to have evened out pretty well
no one in my family really does
that tells me that there is natural oils in here
if anything that helps me relax which is great since this goes on before bed
this thing definitely works.
even-toned skin that frankly looks amazing at my age
i didn't realize how amazing this stuff was until i noticed the difference in my skin after i ran out
i really love it.
what i like best about this oil is that it really evens my skins texture
i find that my skin loves it
the way my skin looks
a bottle does last quite awhile
at first i was super skeptical thinking how is this stuff seriously going to minimize those little frown lines coming in
this stuff really helps
although i do not think this is the main reasons my breakouts have been going away it makes my skin feel so smooth in the morning
you where it when you sleep so who cares
you definitely get what you pay for!
it really feels special
i do feel like my skin looks better overall in the mornings after applying it
it made me break out pretty bad
the smell really isn't as bad as some people have said
okay, to start off, i am in love.
i would definitely recommend this for anyone with texture
really wants to have baby-
she told me she'd give me a sample to try it out
she was so right
this stuff works as a wonder
but i feel like my face glows a lot more.
i really love my results with this.
i heard a lot about this oil
for the ones who said it was good
i would definitely recommend it!
this always brings it back to life
not really something talked about
this blue oil is actually amazing at any stage.
heard great things about this so decided to give it a try
this stuff is the real deal
this has definitely helped it go down
i really like this product.
always test my high end stuff before i buy them
to how it makes my skin feel
my face looks really good
that is for sure
everyone asked me what i used on my skin because it always looked great
not a word from anyone about how great my skin looked
it smells very natural which i love in my opinion so glad they put the 55$ one the 105 bottle was a little to much
this stuff literally helps with all my skin problems
as this stuff is too amazing to keep to myself
for the first few applications it's really just a nice hydrating oil
a very little does your whole face
i really like this.
they have worked out really well for me
since i really liked how a couple of givenchy products worked i thought i'd give their serum a try
a pretty noticeable floral scent which scared me because i thought it might break me out
would really love to use it in the day time
gives you that youth feel
i really recommend this product.
after only 2 weeks i can see an feel a big difference alrdy
after trying it for 3 nights i can honestly say it has improves my skin appearance
this stuff really works.
i really love this product!
wanted something to counteract how tired my skin can get from work
i love the way it makes my face feel
i wasn't going to use it on my whole face
it covers it really well
the bottle is pretty as well :
the serums do not only look pretty
especially the fact that i get to see clearly what i have bought
definitely see a difference after using the products
really enjoyed how it felt on my skin
i know they work well
feel good on my skin
bought it thinking it would be good for maintaining my good skin
this is definitely not cheap
my skin has never looked so good
this is the first product i've used where people are asking me what i'm doing differently
i really recommend this product!
i am really glad i tried this serum as it was what my skin needed
i honestly believe the "customization" is what makes the difference
i liked how it felt on my skin
i do feel like my skin has been improving
did feel there was an improvement in my skin
i could really feel that my skin got better after several times of using
i could really feel/see a difference
this product inspired me to do so
nothing worked really well until i got this serum
i am definitely ordering another bottle!
i really love it!
thought it would be fun to try
i really love these
see amazing results when i use them
this concept is great because you get exactly what your skin needs
so when i am done with the whole bottle
when my skin was going through crazy hormone changes
lately i haven't felt the need for it
really love the product
it's quite amazing, actually.
i've noticed since using it my skin looks really great
so far seems to be healing my acne scars really nicely
i do get some acne here
my face felt so smooth
someone from work actually said my skin looked flawless
the way it feels
i wanted something to help fine lines
at first it feels like there's nothing going on your skin
after getting really great results i've been able to stop using all other night time treatments
while this is really powerful stuff
i really believe that the formulation is so gentle that just about everyone could build up to using it full time
it makes my skin feel nice.
my skin really does look amazing.
i didn't get my hopes up because i've tried a lot of things to combat my texture
overall i love this stuff
i've stopped using foundation because honestly my skin looks better
over time this product does certainly improve my skins texture
this stuff is so good.
my skin looks good enough to not wear foundation the next day
i could definitely see a big difference in my pore size
this stuff is a life saver.
i feel as though this has really made a major difference in my skin
read good things about retinols
i definitely see improvement in both fine lines around my eye area
it worked so nicely that i decided to try the 3%
it really protects my skin.
i always thought that ptr's retinol was great
my skin definitely feels like new skin
i loved this stuff!
kinda sad though that it doesn't work with my new water based moisturizer
but like the title says i love this stuff.
i used other primers but this stuff is amazing.
other than that it's definitely a good product to have
i think added fragrance is in everything they make?
have a hard time finding something that is matte
always seeing it out of stock
thinking to myself "this must be some good stuff
got a lot of compliments on how smooth my skin looked
this stuff really works..... thanks murad!!!
one aspect that i love is that it helps hide the fine lines around my eyes
felt nice on my face
great to use even if your not wearing makeup.
i just really like products that cover both steps
you definitely get what you pay for
all i really wanted was a primer to use under my makeup
with my mom not seeing me for all that time
i really like this stuff
so you know this stuff works
love the way it goes on
because the results looked that good
feels amazing when you put it on
actually makes me feel more comfortable in my makeup free skin
i don't feel like i have control of how much comes out
it really keeps my face matte all day
and i really like it!
i feel like this works really well under the ones i use
i think this would be nice alone, too!
if you love the idea of spf
how it makes my skin look
it makes my makeup look so flawless
well for me it is
this one is very good to wear alone.
try to take really good care of my skin
i get a lot of compliments on my skin
i think you should give it a try since everyone has different skin
the good thing about sephora is that you can always return it if you do not like it
i think that happens when you have something on before using this product because some products just don't mix well together
i feel that it mattified
this really does this job.
love the feeling of putting it on
love the feeling of my face after i use it
think it is perfect for those days when i don't feel like makeup because my face still has a great finish
wanted something with protection that would smooth on nicely
i love the feel as it can double as a primer
it holds the foundation really well
i actually really like this.
it looks terrible when these rolls form
is hard to find the right product for my face
on it's own for a no-makeup day it works really well
leaves it feeling really smooth
it really sinks into the skin.
my skin looks so good
this really helps control my oil during the day.
this face cream is really moisturising.
i've never found a moisturizer that truly addresses all of my issues
i felt good knowing my skin wasn't looking oily as always
price is worth it because you need very little to apply to your whole face
not only does this product look great under makeup
this is definitely on my "loves" list
i felt the need to state how amazing this moisturizer is
one of the sephora girls recommended this to me because i told her that i get super oily
primers make me break out really bad
but as a moisturizer, it is really good.
i really liked it
really keeps my oil at bay
it really keeps me matte all day long
my skin has never looked or felt better!
makeup stay flawless pretty much all day
love the way the gel feels when you first put it on your skin
it really does mattify your skin.
it is seriously a dream come true
this stuff is the bomb!
finally made it so that i'm not always shiny
this stuff made a huge difference on how oily my face looked at the end of the day
definitely a skin rescue for me!
helping me not look like a hawt mess with all that makeup on
this really works to keep the oil down all day
but that's fine with me.
i really liked it
this stuff is saving my life
really helps with my makeup application routine as well
i think that works really well for my skin
it also didnt make me breakout at all like some moisturizers do
that seems to wear off pretty quick
i think this is the one
it's really hard for me to find anything that i really consider good enough for my permanent routine
not sure about the mattifying part
where has this stuff been every summer of my life?
know this will last me quite a while
this thing has done miracles for my skin.
i really like this stuff.
it is pretty good -- i feel like if i used a liquid foundation
i never tried patting it in like the instructions said
it does that perfectly for me
make sure you do a good job washing it off at days end though
i am always trying different primers i really like this one
so a product like this is a necessity for me
so great product if you want to wear it by it self
this got good reviews so i picked some up.
it really works well.
the real test is my mother
i need something to even out my skin tone
it seems like a lot
as demo'd it is supposed to feel wet
i could really see a difference
this makes a world of difference for me
i really love this product
all my friend tells me that the skin around my eyes looks brighter
i wanted to give this eye essence a try
i like this product a lot because it's incredibly brightening
the eye essence feels cool going on
i feel that my eyes are what age me the most
i noticed how tired my eyes looked
my mom told me it was amazing.
it really makes a difference right away
the brightness around my eyes obviously perked my look up enough that others noticed it as quickly as i did
now i am definitely purchasing
i just love how plump it makes my skin feel
babying my skin with nice products
keeps it feeling that way for a while after application which is something i always look for in a moisturizer
thought i really liked it til i started realizing my nose still wasn't getting enough hydration
this one was good to me for awhile
this stuff works so well
i got so many compliments
it felt nice to take days off from wearing makeup
this stuff is seriously the best
this stuff is truly my holygrail.
for a good 2 years before i discovered this stuff
i don't even know where to start with this product everything about it is perfect the way my face feels
with this stuff my skin is wayyyy better
i really really love this stuff
i don't really like this for summer
i am in sales so make up is a must just my skin look disgusting
this stuff is miracle work for my skin
both made my skin feel very cool
this honestly saved my skin so many times.
they all love it too
i could feel it sink into my skin
ok so this is genuinely amazing.
that is everything to me!
it is really changing the texture of my skin.
i absolutely love this stuff if you are not sure about trying it do yourself a favor
you can tell it really moisturizes well
this stuff is truly the bomb i'm definitely going to buy the full size
this stuff made an immediate difference in helping me get back to soft
this is a keeper for sure
it feels so good in the morning
it feels like it should!
it feels smooth going on
i love how this makes my skin feel.
made my skin feel amazing!
this left my face feeling amazing it is very thick
these days i try things for myself
i could still feel it on my skin hours
i give it a try and found my love.
this stuff is straight up the best moisturizer-doesnt claim to be any else
it made me realize how much this moisturizer did for my face
it's honestly one of the best moisturizers i've tried that actually help dry skin for the whole day
this always saves the day
it is truly quality stuff.
well he loved it
just what my 20 something son said
this one is so good i felt like i had to
this stuff stays on my skin all night
i think it's a fair price for the quality of product you're getting
i can feel it as well
personally i find this one way better for my skin type
very good for no make up days or for night time
it feels so good putting on
i've noticed other things i needed to start working on
looks like it's going to be lasting me awhile
never in my life has my skin looked or felt this good
probably because my skin is combo.
i actually really like this
it does not feel heavy going on the face
i just love the way my skin feels after using it
the combo really helps my skin
i definitely feel clean afterwards
it has a nice feel and smell to it.
i feel pretty tight afterwards.
tight no moisturizer can really save it
i love how it makes my skin feel
but after all i really recommend this !
i really like this face wash.
definitely gonna purchase it when i'm done with my samples
i really love this.
this made me think it's left my skin really clean
my skin seems to like it
i feel like it wakes my skin up
definitely recommend that product
i think it might be helping my skin clear up
always feels clean, but never dries out my skin.
i really like the smell
i think this cleanser is really good at removing makeup
nothing has worked very well give it a try
i really love this face cleanser!
it works really well.
i like how it makes my skin feel
my skin was breaking out pretty badly from trying out different br
it really helped balance out my skin!
this face wash made my face feel so good
i definitely recommend this face wash.
but i still love it.
and i really liked it.
i definitely felt very clean
i like how this makes my face feel after i use it
i can feel the difference of living my skin plump
i do not wear face makeup a whole lot
want an easy way to get it off
it literally feels like i am refreshing my skin.
not only this product is good for your skin
it actually does remove makeup very well
it helps my skin feel great during the day
i think i found it
i think this is a keeper for me.
i really like it
i feel that i'm doing something good for my skin
i really like this moisturizer!
that hasn't happened this year since this moisturizer hydrates really well
it does not feel greasy at all.
i really do love this stuff.
the only reason i'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is because i feel like i have to use a large amount of this product to really cover my face
i really love this line!
think it did well in that aspect
i'll prob use it as a good go to while searching for that miracle face product we always dream about
i am always on the hunt for a good moisturizer.
i think she was right
we think this formula helps control his break outs
it smells pretty good too!
boy does it feel very refreshing
so gosh dang amazing!!!!
took some time for me to really start using it
i think the scent is nice too.
i love how this feels on my skin.
with this moisturizer i feel like my skin finally gets what it needs
i also feel like it makes a good primer for my makeup
i give 5 stars because it works in my situation
i love the cooling feeling it gives too.
i always go back to it because it does an amazing job at moisturizing my very rough
try it & let your skin feel happy!
you could really tell the difference with the aqua bomb
it truly feels like my skin is drinking it all in
you know it's a good product when you actually look forward to applying it
it definitely didn't do as good of a job as aqua bomb
i really love this moisturizer
it's never looked/felt better after just 3 weeks
feels like i have nothing on
i really like that feeling especially when i'm about to beat tf out of my face
sure my face where the psoriasis wasn't felt great
belief really does the trick
see how you like it
i do find myself using a good amount of it
it makes my skin feel amazing.
i find that i need something that is great with the wind
it has a gel-like consistency that is cool when you put it on at first
that got me really frustrated because my skin feels so soft
this makes my skin feel amazing.
it has really make a difference!
my catch my boyfriend using this--it's amazing stuff
you can feel it sinking in
i dig it a lot.
i can feel/see a huge difference in my skin after using this
how pleasant it felt on my face
this stuff is way less like water
makes your face feel so so so so soft
i really love this!
this thing goes down so quick
this stuff is the business
i feel the cooling and it feels amazing!!!
this product truly makes my skin feel so nice
i think it makes my makeup apply so nicely after
honestly it's a great moisturizer for probably any skin type
i really like how this feels on my skin.
when she told me that i needed a nice hydrated surface for foundation to really work
she suggested this stuff
it's probably that it feels amazing on the skin!
that's a good thing though
my skin has been so good since using this
i definitely recommend this product
i guess that would change the overall consistency of the product
definitely a staple in my skin care routine.
this still works like miracle
never in my life have i felt my skin so sooth
it does feel a bit sticky for awhile after application
by morning, my skin will feel soooo smooth.
i feel like my skin is glowing after using this!
i love the way it feels to put it on--this is going to sound weird
want to keep my under eye looking this good for as long as i can
this stuff is it!!!
i can definitely feel the difference on the days i skip it
i think they're too harsh for me.
okay so first off i'm a huge fan of the belif br
anyways, it's a really great eye cream!
but i love the way it feels.
as we talked more about how i felt
i noticed other really fine lines
i remembered being told that eyecreams can sometimes used as a neck cream too
i love how it feels
i just love how my skin feels when i wear the product
i am really seeing some improvement where i wanted to
really love this cream.
so for me it is what i want in an eye cream
i love this mask because it really does reduce the appearance of dark spots
i do feel like my complexion is brighter as well.
said my skin looks so nice
i really do love this mask.
this mask really works
i want the whole line of belif products now.
it truly evened out my tone.
i definitely recommend this product to any one .
that it feels so good on my face
as i really like the results i am getting
it makes my skin feel great by morning time
a lot of overnight masks feel like they just sit on my skin
i definitely notice that my skin is smoother
you get a lot of product
i never really tried a peel off mask
a lot of the one star reviews on here say something along the lines of
either way, still a nice product in my opinion.
i actually end up liking it
i love how rejuvenated my skin feels after using this mask
really does help the rejuvenation process
my skin still thinks i'm a teenager
i really like it!
i really love this mask because
using this mask is always a treat for me.
honestly peeling it off afterward is so much fun
thought the process of this one sounded interesting
i really enjoy using this mask.
i really love the way my skin looks in the morning after using this product
i feel as if it is acting like a barrier on the skin then
feels like it did in my 20's
this product was so great i felt i should share the wealth
definitely has been living up to it's claims.
love this stuff under my makeup.
- pump comes with a cap so great to throw in your luggage for traveling- leaves my skin feeling smooth for sure
i do really really enjoy it
i should mention that although it says "oil" the emphasis should be on "gel" you don't really feel the oil at all
for that purpose i don't think that it would be very good
i feel that using this has really balanced out my combination skin
for those who feel they should be using something different around the eyes
i feel pretty good about the results-for-price exchange of this product
i always come back to this eye cream.
that i feel like actually accomplishes what it sets out to do
have had dark circles my whole life
luckily i have found certain products that work for me
i really like this one
one that isn't so deep -- i'm pretty sure this is helping to prevent future lines
want something that'll really work- pick this little gem up
not on my under eye quite
i love the way it feels
'm always noticing some manipulation
with this cream i really like how my undereye area is looking
i mean i think it is beginning to look "flawless"
now i don't feel so disgusted whenever i saw dark circles around my eyes
people honestly think i'm almost 10 years younger than i am
i am a no makeup person so it is perfect for me.
really enjoyed using it
because im always outside
which works great with my skin tone that's got a bit of red in it
i like this a lot.
i think i would consider this a really great summer moisturizer
it feels a lot like a primer
i feel like it brings a sort of balance
ever since i started using this everyone mentions how i just have a glow about me
not everything is going to work for everybody
i really recommend this product
it really does make my skin look more bright
i find that i have to use quite a bit to feel like it is on my skin
as they feel heavy
i really like this oil.
it seemed like a good oil, but not life-changing.
my skin has never felt or looked this good!!
embracing just how great the right oil can be for all skin types -- you just have to find the right one
there's a learning curve to knowing how many drops your skin needs
i really like this oil.
it has made a pleasant difference in the feel of my skin
it honestly helped my skin.
honestly help with the texture
i really don't like
i swear my skin looks better
feel amazing on my skin
you can definitely feel a difference even after one time
so of course i love this
it is the only thing that helps.
now if i feel that skin start to itch
it works wonders for my skin
people always comment how good my skin is .
it is definitely an oil
i really like this!
it definitely made a difference
it was only doing ok
i don't really think it's a big deal
really like the results
i definitely notice the consistency is different on my face
felt it was too light on it's own
i feel this is a better choice for my skin
maybe my skin loves bht
this combo truly gives me younger
i really enjoy this face oil.
i've struggled with breakouts for what feels like forever
i really liked it
i us this morning
this stuff works to keep my skin looking good
second it feels so nice
gets my makeup off pretty good
it made my face feel so clean
i feel that sometimes 3-4 pumps is just not enough to get the clean that i want
i feel like i am going through the product very quickly
i really enjoy it
hope y'all found this helpful!
it does a great job of deeply cleaning while still leaving the skin comfortable
seriously, my skin has never looked this amazing.
i think i've finally found a cleanser that works for me
this cleanser has been a very good one to deal with my problem skin
who can really put a price on that?
saying this cleanser would help out immensely if i tried it
it's definitely worth giving it a shot if you miss feeling your face as soft
really wanted to try this wash
how amazing they were
i definitely recommend this product!!
'm sure it will last quite some time
it makes my skin feel amazing after i'm done
people often compliment me on how great my skin is
i definitely see a huge difference in my skin
bonus that it's also fun to use and is pretty!
gave me a gift card to sephora with the condition that i buy myself something i want
so i got this.
i don't mind the small at alldon't really see a difference when i put it on
still going to see what kind of results i get
i am definitely on the oily side lately
i actually had a bad experience with it
it has definitely helped to control
i know it sounds like a lot
i really recommend this product
out of all the things in it
i definitely prefer this
feels very good on the skin
and it made my skin so good.
if you touch your face you can feel it on there
even though i am in my 50's my skin is still pretty oily in the summer
basically i like this product.
i think it's good for summer.
really works for me
feels so good on your skin.
i get so many compliments on my complexion!!
it does a really good job of blurring imperfections
really does blur the way it says it will
i really like this a lot.
i still really like it
this stuff gives you the perfectly primed face texture you need to put the rest of your make up on
i really love it.
it really does make your skin look smooth
i really like it
it really looks good on your skin by itself or under foundation/bb cream
i feel like everyone that works there tries to talk me out of algenist products
i now feel protected
i hope it last's the whole summer.
i want very much to love it
it really does the job
it feels a little think to put on
i really like it.
at first i did not like the product because it was quite thick
i got super dry from something else i was using.
i really appreciate having this h
feels on my face
it has the same feel
i am pretty fair
i definitely thought my skin looked better while i was using this
it did not break me out which is great since i have combination skin
obviously for younger ladies it will be a big help to improve the aging appearance
my skin feels so good after using this
it looks good too
think it's really removing the bad stuff
because i actually have always had nice clean normal skin
my skin feels like a newborn's bottom
it really feels lovely going on
i love the way my skin feels after i use it
because you get a lot for your money
i liked that it comes off easily
makes me feel flawless
its really not that bad
i really enjoy this mask!
the smell is pretty off-putting
you're obviously going to be curious because you don't always get the results you want in one day
you definitely need to follow it up with moisturizer
how it made my face feel during
my skin felt so amazing
it felt so nice
i just tried it for the fun of it
it made my skin feel
this stuff is the bomb!
it makes me feel light again
i like how this mask made my skin feel.
this is it guys
this definitely fits the bill
this definitely fit the bill.
i really liked the tingle this gave me while wearing it
my skin felt amazing afterwards.
the texture is a little weird at first
i will say my skin feels soooo smooth after using it
i feel so fresh
bonus that my boyfriend also likes how it works for him
i love the subtle sting it gives– i can actually feel it working
it has benefitted me a great deal for when i start to feel a bit more on the oily side
needs a pick me up: this is the mask for you
just make sure you use a good moisturize after.
i know someone mentioned that the scent is strong
i love the way it feels going on
t's the experience of the feel of the mask going on
hopefully if you're sensitive
some not so good
the fact that it works sooo well
literally right after the first use i saw a difference in my skin which made me extremely happy
the only thing that aggravates me is the little lumps really thought it was going to be more creamy
foundation that i use you can still use those stupid little bumps it makes me so mad
i know not everybody has the same skin
i feel they honestly do the same job!
definitely a good item to have on hand.
it did make my skin feel very clean otherwise
it really does feel like it gets rid of the gunk in my face
this definitely helped reduce how oily my face got during the day
i honestly feel like this mask works better then the glamglow mask
it really evens out skin tone
this one definitely tops them all.
i kid you not.
my face still felt great
he is not a face cream/mask guy
it makes my skin so firm and it's really fun!
this stuff hands down works wonders!
it really took away some of the texture i've been having lately
my make up looked very smooth when i put it one
my skin has never looked this good.
my acne was pretty bad
i definitely recommend this mask it works wonders
i really like what this product does.
i feel like it really does cleanse
my pores do feel better after using it
i've had pretty bad acne for a while
a lot of people are complaining about the smell
the mask also works really well as a spot treatment
hope you enjoy it!
can really tell a difference in my skin
i've found one i love here
makes my skin feel
you can really feel it working
you really only need one pump for your whole face
it feels very nice on your skin
i think this would be a very nice mask to do with friends

it was really fun to use because the bubbles
though it did make my skin feel softer

definitely has the same effects
my skin felt new!
everything i want in a mask.
i really love the feel of it
i think it's just a fun mask to use once a week.
love the way this makes my skin feel.
i've always had problem skin
it's definitely a fun mask to do with your friends
how my skin feel afterwards
i really like this mask.
definitely recommend it does the job!
i just think it was kinda fun
my kids were always giggling whenever they look at my face with lots of bubbles
it seemed like my skin felt brighter
i would definitely recommend it.
its very nice its fell very weard when u put on face
turns out i don't need to this stuff really works my skin is brighter
it's so fun and different!
people are always complimenting my skin after each use
the bubbling of the gel once it is exposed to oxygen does not bother me because i am very happy with the results
like it was just feeling air.
i loved the feeling during and afterwards.
i really felt that it got out the bug spray
i really like it.
this mask really does wonders
it definitely perks up tired skin
felt really fun when bubbling on the skin
i really like it
this product is great did everything to my said it said it would
now feels like how a normal person's face should feel
i face felt really hot though.
i swear my makeup looked amazing the whole day.
i must have really needed it!
we each loved it
feel they all get the job done
this one is so fun
i really like this product
you can really feel the warming sensation that way
takes off my makeup really well
it feels so good
i really love it.
i my skin also looks
feels really great since i have started using it
i love it make my skin clear
i also really love the way it makes my face feel after
my face felt like it was really clean all the way down
didn't feel tight at all
felt like a baby's bottom
it has been working very well for me
so this does the job for me nicely
it makes my face feel so clean
it makes my face feel nice
love everything about it
it also does a good job removing my makeup.
this stuff is insane
i wanted to try something different
really like the way i can feel my pores tightening when i use this
although it is gentle, it gets the job done.
effects are all alright
really work it into your skin
i feel it works immediately.
definitely remember you have use this oil every night to really see a difference in your skin though
my skin before using this had areas of grey honestly
they are definetly meant to be paired together
love how this feels and when i wake up in the am.
you can tell a different in your skin
i feel like when i use this at night my skin looks better the next morning
this has done wonders for me
this has done wonders for me!
i honestly gave up
my skin loves this stuff.
my skin downright loves this stuff
you need very little to cover your face
even through i really loved this oil i plan on buying the night-a-mins cream
i just loved it
you would think it would be really oily
this oil did only good things for it
'm going through this pretty quickly
it really evened my skintone
i love this product soooooo much its great for skin that has scars
this has definitely helped clear
i will always have a bottle of this always!!!
i don't like the feeling of anything sitting on my skin
then everyone started commenting on how great my skin looked --
this oil really did make my skin less red
just by the darn thing
i feel like it was always a battle to find something that helped to clear my acne
i really appreciate the staff in sephora who recommend this product to me
i love the way it looks
definitely give this a try
i am pretty hooked
most things i use on my face break me out
i really love this stuff.
i really liked this oil
i really liked how my face felt in the morning.
my skin definitely looks smoother
it felt really nice and smelled good too.
it makes my face feel
in my life i have never looked at myself
this stuff has been a life changer!!
just thinking i am amazing my skin can look this good with something with one use
this product sure helps with the job.
i love the way this feels when it is working on my face
what a great pick me up for tired skin!
i always get compliments on my skin after i use it
you can really feel it cleaning your skin out
which i never get compliments on my skin
it added a fun kinda spin to the mask
my face had never felt so soft and so clean.
you can really feel it working
i spend whole night
i looked like i slept so well
i couldn't believe how good my skin felt after.
people always comment that my skin looks great
this stuff really is a miracle in a bottle.
you really don't need a lot
it feels so nice too!
you can truly feel it bubbling on your face.
ps: while the product is on your face it does feel weird
felt incredibly smooth which at 36 which i never took care of until very recently is huge
this is a great mask for those times when your skin looks tired
and it feels really cool when it is bubbling up.
i am a sucker for things that i can feel work
my skin tone was as if i had i just put on a primer too
this definitely fits the bill of what i look for in a good product
makes me feel like my skin actually has more "bounce back" in the morning
feel like a whole new you
does not feel too heavy though for me.
there was nothing about it that i really loved
really, really love this moisturizer!
i feel like it definitely faded some of my wrinkles
i will tell you that this is a very good moisturizer
you should definitely give it a try
she was so right
my skin is definitely not that of my 20's anymore
trying it out yourself
my skin has never felt softer
feel of this cream makes me feel like i'm in a rose garden
my mom are now all hooked because of me
my skin feels great for hours, even under makeup.
i do love how it makes my skin feel
i love the way it makes my skin look
honestly my skin has never felt so soft
i've never found a moisturizer i've liked before because they leave my skin greasy or smell too strong
almost likes it look right after i work out
i love the way the product feels.
if you experience talking
it really healed my skin after some bad reactions to other products
that actually makes good skin care
this has made my skin feel like a dream
but gosh it balanced my skin nicely!
i feel that it keeps my face not super dry
as a mask i find it to be good
you won't feel tight after using this.
i love how this feels and smells.
i know there are a lot of poor reviews here for this product
strong enough that i can embrace myself in it
it is definitely going to be a beauty staple for a long time
i am definitely going to have to purchase a bottle of this
i wasn't bummed because as i look closer
look it up on here
it really is comforting since when i put it on after a while
so this really works
asked if they could recommend to me a good moisturizer for combination skin
my skin knows when i run out of this product!
i noticed this myself
i got a sample of this moisturizer because i loved the idea of it being all natural
no moisturizer has given me that feeling before
this product would also be good for any skin type honestly
and the smell is really nice too.
i really like this product
i really like the smell, too.
i really love this product!
i really love this product.
i am definitely buying this!
i've never felt anything like it!!
the only thing i've found that really seems to clean them out
i really like this.
it truly feels like it's a lot cleaner
it really did reduce the size of my pores
i really like how my skin brightens up after every use
tbh this worked better
but thats all its good for.
i tried everything nothing works so fast like this mask
definitely made my skin look brighter after one use
this stuff works wonders
i love using this after a really tough work out.
my skin is always so clear
i really do see the difference
my skin looked like a mess
which is a very good sign that a masque is doing what it should be'clearing pores
i really enjoyed it
every time i use this mask my skin feels so clear after
i feel like i have to use a lot of product at a time
so basically i wanted a magic mask to decrease breakouts
what can i say i'm truly impressed it's makes my skin look clean
it also really helped my whiteheads.
you feel like your skin can really breathe after using this mask- needless to say i immediately went out
definitely like what the mask is named
large pores have always been the thing i hated about my skin
have never tried a face mask that worked so well i am so please
it's gotta be great
as it is a clay mask it does feel quite tight on the skin
i still feel a bit tight
it did leave my skin feeling so
i've tried everything to get them out without a lot of success
i can see the dirty stuff are coming out,
it leaves my skin feeling so good!
i used this mask fully expecting it to feel good
i am definitely going to continue using this.
i definitely needed to use a moisturizer afterward though
i feel this mask really improves my skin.
i definitely recommend this product.
the day after i use it i wonder why my skin looks so good
it feels great when you apply it.
i swear to you that it made them smaller my skin felt fresh
i said "what the heck"
help these bad boys tighten up so honestly there was nothing to lose
i seriously thought i was just sampling some face mask that claims to help your skin in come way
some of the reviews said it's difficult to get off
if this keeps happening i will definitely be repurchasing
it also comes in a pretty big bottle considering you need very little for your face
the thing that i really like about it is if i have a scar from a pimple it will help to reduce it
just make sure you moisturize really well afterward
you can tell this mask is doing some good stuff to your skin
so it's a good deal.
i really wanted to like this product
just gets the job done.
i really noticed a difference when i paired this with the exfolitor
it does help a lot
so they make me feel safer during pregnancy
cooling feel like never before
it truly drives me crazy
this mask has worked really well for me if i use it every night as a spot treatment
the good thing is that this mask won't dry out your face so you really can use it every night
i really enjoy this mask.
i dislike masks that make my skin feel tight
i find it helps to keep my skin clear
some not so nice
no gimmicks, this stuff really works.
that's a good sign that it's working
i really see a difference in my skin
it's made a huge difference for me -i put it on
she told me i needed a better moisturizer to help make my makeup look smoother
way it makes my face feel
i am in love!my skin is so smooth!
i just got this and am really liking it so far.
my skin definitely seems softer
i really like this product- i use it every night
really makes me feel so cleansed
one nice sales told me to try this new produce
she told me this one doing a good job on hydrating
after i tried it, it definitely works.
you will feel you skin never had that smooth before
i tried pretty much all thes masks from sephora
really love how this mask is so soothing
i really needed this over the summer
or just skin that feels knackered in general
my skin is definitely brighter
the texture had really improve
it definitely makes my skin feel clean
i feel the difference after using it
love the way they both make my skin feel
my skin is really smooth after i use it
especially, it has a really good smell.
it's really great stuff!
i love how my face feels after i wash it off.
the only things i'm not crazy about is for me it's a bit hard to apply in a consistent thickness on my face
you can feel it tingle letting you know it's working
really does what it says
i felt like it made a difference after one use
this one feels like it actually makes a difference
i'll definitely recommend this to everyone!
this stuff is so good for my oily
my makeup, skin everything looks better!
i only do so when a product truly impresses me
so the bottle goes pretty fast
i kind of wish it was a peel off mask because those are so satisfying
i still love the way my skin looks
this has done wonders for my face.
which i felt worked only ok
this is definitely going to be a new staple in my regimen
it makes my pores feel amazing right afterwards
i really like this mask.
to the fact that it did so truly impresses me
i got this as a vib reward and loved it!
my skin looks so nice after using this i feel like i could actually go out without foundation
it really does mattify your face
this mask gets the job done.
i really love the way my skin feels after mask is removed
my only gripe that i can live with is the smell just isn't very pleasant
now it really isn't bad at all
you actually get quite a bit
i can already feel a difference in how soft my skin has gotten
i heard good things about this br
it is so weird.
i get compliments on it all the time
i think the smell is very nice
that stuff really puts moisterizers to there test
im prettty sure this is the product thats working the hardest
my neck especially loves it.
i think that's good because you can use less of it
so she knew i would love this oil
it honestly makes the difference its amazing
i felt like i was wasting this really great moisturizer
he loves it too
when reading reviews it's important to remember that everyones skin is different
so does my mom definitely will be repurchasing
it made my skin feel great
feel great while they're on
if you are obsessed like me just go out
found it to work really great on my skin
definitely give it a try!
i actually looked decent without makeup
i heard so many amazing things about k beauty
it also really works!
the only thing i wasn't satisfied with is that it didn't do a very good job at taking off eye makeup
then use this because it does a really good job to clean off face makeup
it really removes all of my makeup
this stuff is the bomb
i really love that it's designed to be travel friendly
it kinda feels a bit greasy at first
it comes off really easily
my sink has always bad issues
i really like the smell of erborian products
was really trying to find something that wouldn't be so harsh on my face
it really does the job.
i do feel like there is some residue
even my fiancé commented on how nice my skin felt
it always leaves my skin feeling so good
i am always trying new br
i do love trying new things
this is my first review because i wanted to share how awesome this product makes your skin feel
if you wear a pretty good amount of coverage
for me that's a lot of primer
appreciate something nice that is able to work instantly by itself
feel like it's working better since i have all of my makeup dissolved before h
makes my skin feel really great.
i happen to really love the smell of it
when i just use this my skin feels nice
love the way it leaves my skin feeling.
it is my go to anytime i have a bad experience with a product that is unfamiliar
thought this product was cute
i really like this product.
i hasn't broken my out, which is nice.
especially for people like me who like full coverage makeup
i feel like my cleanser can really penetrate
like something really natural
i also really like how it felt in my skin
it does feel weird at first
my cheeks have never felt so smooth
let me start off by saying that my skin is incredibly dry
smells so good when first applying
it really has so many great products
it feels so good.
it makes my face feel great
worries me because i wonder if the product is just sitting on my face
also, i love the way this smells!
i really love this cleamser.
this product gets the job done.
this product works really well.
everyone has noticed how nice my skin looks
it makes my face feel so clean after using it
really liked how it felt
t is definitely a good price at $39
it felt so great on my skin
he is always asking me to feel how soft his skin is
cool look and feel too.
i just don't really like the bottle .
what i love most is that i feel it does makes a huge difference
i've received a lot of complements from people about how good my makeup has looked
i don't know how they made this so wonderful
honest to goodness the oiliest skin in the whole world
this reminds me of that
want a good clean to start your day
t is hard to tell whether this is a result of me showing my skin some love
because it feels light
'm usually in need of under eye help
i think i found the one
always thought they were a waste of money
anyone who has suffered from dark circles knows that it can make you look tired
it really does all the things it claims.
this eye cream had just surprised the heck out of me
a lady at sephora told me to use very little eye cream to brighten
i will definitely recommend it.
i can definitely see the difference
does not feel harsh on my skin at all
can see a big difference
apparently so does my fiancé who seems to be using it almost more than me haha definitely two thumbs up for this one
i love how it is in a stick
i loved how clean my face felt after using this!
screwing it up to use it was really convenient!
once u get going it scrubs very well
i really like this product!
otherwise it does make my skin feel nice
this stuff is so bomb.
really does its job and keeps my face clear.
my entire life i have had really bad black heads.
make sure you leave it on there for a bit
my skin always looks
gets the job done
then i noticed how my skin was very smooth
feel that it not only clears my skin
with really bad acne
i really like how this has worked for my combination skin
i don't feel like i have to set it as much
which can range from really try--to really oily
i really like the way this product feels on my skin
one way to really make sure that the product is working is to use steam
agter 2 uses i can see and feel the difference.
it will be from me touching those areas through out the day still being amazed that it feels so smooth
really gets in the pores
i would definitely recommend this product.
makes my skin feel brand new.
it really does make your skin feel super duper clean
nothing really keeps it under control
less breakouts and for me, that's a big deal.
i think it definitely helps during those periods
it does a pretty good job when you use it as a wash
it does tighten my pores a good bit.
make sure you use a good moisturizer afterwards
and it's holding up very well.
to see how my skin likes it
it's a fun thing to use if you like to try different beauty products
i really love bosica products
it really gets in there
i will say the first week my skin freaked out a little bit
it's definitely a weird consistency
my boyfriend already has really great skin
he just called me on his lunch break to tell me that his skin is the best hes ever seen it
leave a good feeling in your skin
feels so good and really feels clean after.
ful of other things with no luck so when i saw this product i was definitely hesitant
i actually really love the packaging.
it is really smooth
i think it is still pretty gentle even on my aging roseacea skin
it's really not that hard to twist up just slightly
i really did enjoy this product
my face broke out pretty bad
as this feels like it takes everything off
after just one use, my pores looked amazing!
i even got my brother to do it with me!!
i do feel a little burning sensation
this product is working really well
i both really liked this face wash
we both loved how it made our faces feel
one thing to keep in mind is to really wet your face first
i really liked this clay mask.
my skin is usually pretty clear
this helped my skin a lot in my opinion
i really like this stick treatment.
regardless i think this a very good cleanser.
it works well for me all seasons
i still feel so light
it is going very well for day under makeup
do think it is a good value
i love how light it felt
i love it a lot.
feels like a lot at first
i really like it.
it has a weird feel at 1st
it just feels like my bare skin like nothing is on
it would always make me breakout
it's so refreshing, feels just like water.
i felt my skin did look less dull
it has been looking pretty dull
i really like the scent a lot.
would definitely recommend this!
really liked that it didn't feel greasy
so for me this product made a difference in my skin
i really enjoy using this oil
still didnt love my skin
starting to learn what this crepiness is that people talk about
they constantly compliment my skin
it really does work!
makes my face feel so good
i used it after the shower so my pores were nice
i can really see the difference now!
the smell is good too.
i wanted to really start getting into taking care of my skin
one a month a break out very bad
i like that it doesn't feel tight
i find it works well for me
smells pretty good too.
after even just one use my skin looked amazing
in fact i thought it felt really nice
my skin really did look amazing afterwards
i can definitely tell the difference when i use this mask
my skin looks so clear
trust me this mask works just make sure you aren't to sparing with it be generous your skin will thank you :
it gets the job done
he told me my face looks brighter
i hate returning stuff
even my fiancé was like wow your skin looks great
you know its really working
this product is changing my life so much that i absolutely have to say something about what i am currently experiencing in a matter of three days time
the smell is great definitely gonna purchase the bigger one soon
i definitely struggle texture
my skin definitely looks
the mask definitely does what it says: my skin looks even-toned
it definitely does make your skin very smooth
i feel as though in order to really see consistent results you do need to use this often
if you feel your skin is looking dull
i definitely see a change in my skin
i definitely notice a change
it has really helped me with my dark spots
has made my skin really smooth
i like it, i really do.
it made my skin feel nice
it really does even out the skin.
imagine it would clean my skin just as well
really did have a radiance to it
this really does work
follow up with a good mosturizer will definitely see some progress
this mask definitely makes my skin feel clean
i don't think it really improves my overall face from a distance
this one i really like
im going to go with what works
it just really gives my complexion
it definitely pulls all the dirt out of your skin
this stuff does it
a lot of products make my face feel heavy
i am not a big fan of that
you will get a lot of uses out of this stuff
this stuff is bomb.
wow it really worked
it really does brighten
the great thing about this product is that you only need a little bit
you can feel it working on your skin
i’m glad i got it because it’s a “quick-fix” in a jar
after only one use i could feel a difference
my skin felt so
this mask really does what it says
it felt so good on my skin
remember that everyone's skin is different
i knew instantly it was the glam glow since i had done nothing different with how i wore my make up that day
i think that is a good way to describe my results
i really enjoy these wipes.
definitely bring this when you're travelling
the one thing about the wipes that i really dislike
i'll definitely put up with
it's pretty bad & i'm not sure why.
really makes me feel like i'm getting all my make up
i know these are more catered to guys
i really like the 2 sides: rough vs smooth
i loved how my face looked afterwards
they make my skin feel
afterwards oh my lanta did my skin feel amazing!
which i loved because i could tell it was doing its job
i can totally see the difference i look so much younger
family tell me that as well
it definitely has a shiny feel
you're face looks so good today
it really does smooth
my makeup was definitely easier to apply
actually this mask is pretty cool
this is my "go-to" treatment when i want to look good that night
this one actually made my skin feel firmer right from the get go
feel so flawless after using it
in the past year i've had some really bad skin issues
its magic in a packet ♥♡tip: make sure you rinse it off really good
i've always been a product junkie
not gotten a compliment or a question if i've done something different to my skin
applying my makeup is actually enjoyable again since my skin is tightened
it works just like the video says!
'm always hesitant that anything can make me look younger
i really like it
it does really well when i use it 3 times a week
this feels like a lot of other masks i've tried
this really really helped
i feel like a lot of masks have short term benefits like they make your skin feel smooth
just one use made my skin feel smooth
i definitely feel it did minimize my pores
i felt like it really helped with that too.
love how it feels.
love how my skin feels afterwards.
it helps it a lot
only problem is that i feel like the effects of the mask only last for like a day
it's definitely worth it and is always my go to.
my face always feels like it's glowing after
just feels so fresh
i always find myself coming back to this one
i really love what this does for my skin.
the only thing this mask really did for me is made my skin softer after us
my face felt good after using.
i feel that over time my skin will continue to look better
it makes my skin feel softer than anything has ever made it feel before
so in love with this product .
your skin feels exactly as described
i would definitely recommend.
i think it really did a great job
her skin always looks on point
i felt it was harsh on my skin
it is so easy to get off
feels awfully minty when you first apply
it did tingle a bit for me
they feel great when washing off
definitely a win for me!
wow holy moly i've never seen a skin care product work so well on my skin so quickly
it definitely tingles when you first apply it
just make sure you really do keep it away from your eyes
it make my skin look so clear
really helped my texture a lot
i really like this mask.
i will definitely say after one application that my skin was brightened
my pores are always something i've struggled with
however, it burns really bad on my face at first.
my skin just loves this stuff
it did tingle a bit while it was on
my face just felt so smooth
it's a little hard to get off
it's just seriously that good.
i feel like it does help with the texture of my skin
left our faces feeling nice
i find that one is waaayyy to harsh on me
i think it's just the mask working
am willing to try anything with my acne ridden combination skin :/ sooo i gave it a go
it was kinda hard to remove
it really did improve the texture of my skin
i've never tried something that works soooo well
really like this mask!
i would definitely recommend this
my skin is pretty clear
i get breakouts here
this mask feels sooo good when it's on
then my skin looks as good as it feels when i take it off
leaves the face feeling so good after
the day after wearing it i never use any face make up because my skin looks amazing
i always get compliments on how good my skin looks
this mask is definitely a st
i will definitely always have this mask in my collection
it also helps your skin feel tighter after use.
in fact you can feel your skin is very smooth
my boyfriend which he has pretty bad skin
after one use his skin looked so amazing
my face feels really nice
it feels great & not too tight when in use.
it really does "retexturize" my skin
this mask definitely burned quite a bit while on
needed something to help me out
i am 14 so when i started to get acne i needed a good mask
i liked it when we tried it
i realized that i wasn't really seeing a huge difference
i could definitely see a difference
this is especially good for someone who travels or had a bad hangover or just use everyday
it smells sooo amazing i'm so addicted i'll definitely purchase over
i've always had my eye on guerlain products
i am definitely buying another bottle.
i get compliments on everything i wear from them.
i really love this product!
the ones there were all good ones
with this product i definitely don't need to: it makes my skin tone even
'm trying makeup without it to see what happens
my skin has never looked so good.
i really enjoy this moisturizer.
i liked it very much.
it's been a long time since i've seen my face nice
because i really want this to be *the* moisturizer
i liked the texture too
it actually helped tremendously with my breakouts
i really like all of them.
definitely love how nice my face feels in the morning
i would definitely reorder it
anyways they really do work
they helped me with acne as well!
it will feel like a face mask
also you get a lot of uses out of it like 5-7 which is amazing for $4
i really suggested trying out one of these masks
it definitely feels like there's something on your face the whole entire night
when you put it you feel so fresh
it works really really well
my skin has literally never looked better
thought i'd try it since it also helps to treat acne
i'd definitely recommend this product!
my mom actually said "wow your skin looks amazing today" when she saw me
these masks are really great for plane rides where the air is really dry
it's been extremely frustrating because you could see them through my makeup
while i'm not sure it made a huge difference
i really addicted to a good masks
everytime i use one of these masks i know i'm going to wake up with amazing looking
honestly the morning i woke after wearing this mask my face felt like it had been super moisturized
they all feel so good on the skin
obviously everyone loves it since it's always sold out
i get so bummed out when they do
i think this really helped me fight acne because now i just have scarring
made my foundation look so good because my skin was one color
honey is definitely the better of the two for me
my skin definitely looked brighter after each use
so just a bit of background on my skin first to fully underst
the impact this freaking mask has had on me
fun, colourful masks- i have several of them.
i put a lot on
my face feels so good in the morning .
worked very well, i love the sleep masks!
it feels really nice on the skin
i think it is awesome that you sleep with it on.
this little guy came in clutch
i really like it hopefully sephora will make it full size in a bottle
it seems like not a lot of product
i really like these masks!
i always make sure to use it before big events.
i personally do a fine layer
i would definitely recommend this!
feels very nice putting it on
've always struggled to find a face lotion that works for me
it definitely keeps my skin matte for quite a few hours although it's not particularly nourishing
i really love this moisturizer.
thought it was -just alright-
works really really well at controlling oil!
under makeup it really has made a difference
good thing i did because it definitely keeps you shine free all day
when i changed to this lotion it really helped a lot
this stuff makes me so happy.
this has made me feel like i have a normal face
it makes me feel matte all day!
there is a perfume scent that last pretty long
honestly i'm in love with this product.
it gets my makeup off so well
i also really like the smell
i've always been bad about washing my face
i go through a bottle pretty fast
then use micellar water to make sure i really got everything
feel in love with it
has left my skin looking pretty wonderful if i do say so myself
so the price is pretty good when you think about it
i think 19$ it's pretty good price.
she loves it too
she says she feels fancy when she uses it.
this is apparently how you know the oils are working
i love how it makes my skin feel
this one gets the job done
this cleansing oil really gets the job done
so that's personally taking adjustment time
i feel like after i used this product
they all love it
people were saying it smells really strong
so happy that you brought back this cleansing oil
this leaves your face feeling really smooth as well
i really enjoy this.
obviously some of it absorbed
this really works wonders with taking off my makeup
i cnt say any enough how good this cleanser feels on my skin
the consistency is just right
this oil is not terrible but it is not very good.
i would only recommend this to someone who wears very light base makeup
this stuff honestly blew me away!
this product worked really well
gets the job done
i really love this product
found this one does the job perfectly fine
my skin didn't really mesh well with this in the beginning
gets the job done
i don't feel like i have to
i wear the inglot #77 eyeliner that can be very hard to take off
definitely worth trying if you are looking to try a cleansing oil
'm glad the price isn't that hard to swallow
however this product makes me feel fresh
i really liked the results
i do feel that the dark spots
i love the way this feels around my eyes.
this product definitely helps me look
be sure to keep it around your eyes
i also feel that it helps my other eye products work better
i am seeing a really big difference in the darkness under my eyes
it works really well under makeup
i've never ever tried any products that can brightening my tired
feel that it is really great for people with sensitivity issues
i guess you could say that your skin looks healthier so there is a small glow to it
i can always count on it to give me instantly smooth
they definitely lightened a fair bit
i can tell you it really worked for me
i noticed a lifting of my cheeks in about two weeks other people noticed as well one person asked me if i had something "done"
not only does this stuff smell amazing
simply feel in love with this
my face felt so different after a day.
i tried a bottle of this stuff
making my foundation look oh so flawless when applied
definitely helps with fine lines
i knew this oil would do great things
this really does have smart technology
bought it when i saw the reviews here on sephora really wanted to see if it was that good
i've always had combination skin
i think this would work for all skin types.
it always left my face feeling greasy.
i think i always find something even better
reminded myself to get on the computer
they're so nice together my skin has never been so soft
and i wear quite a bit of makeup.
it does feel a bit greasy
it does feel a bit greasy
the one thing that really disappointed me is that applying a primer over this resulted in the product clumping
you automaticly feel the diffrence while putting it on
the makeup stays really well on top of it
pple always guess i am much younger then my age
so clearly this is working
the price is right to unlike most stuff at sephora
when you wake up you can still feel moisture
they broke me out terribly
i definitely don't use this during the day
it really stays on all day by itself anyways
just like the big one
i am happy with this little guy
they think we make a cute couple
i knew how to save my skin.
the manager at sephoria thought she could guess my age
we don't want to look older than our men do we?
i can definitely tell a difference looking back through them
i definitely recommend a good
i feel that at the very beginning
you definitely feel it
you feel a little burn
i can tell how powerful this thing is because it feels a lot like the laser treatment in the doctor's office
i really don't mind taking the time to do it
i definitely recommend this product!
yes the laser hurts a bit
all in all i really love this machine!
i've never gotten compliments on my skin.
yes it is not pleasant.
you can definitely feel that this is doing something
you will feel a "pinch"
it does feel very weird at first
so you do feel it
this really rejuvenated my under eye area
you can only go around the eye where you can feel bone
i love them added into my foundation
also the price is pretty up there.
've really enjoyed mixing this in with my bb cream for those no makeup
i feel like i am constantly fighting to keep my rosacea at bay
this stuff is a game changer
my foundation goes on so smooth
it helps give me a very dewy look
i like adding 1-2 drops to my foundation seems like it makes my foundation look more like skin
i really wanted to try it
im sure ill be happy with my purchase because this stuff is awesome
it really does the job in making my skin look flawless
it certainly helps with foundation mixing
just about anything to give my skin a flawless
at 1st i was a bit hesitant to purchase because i thought it would make me look oily
you already know how tempermental this combo is
since i'm not a big fan of foundations
great things to say about the calming oil
it just means it's not good for my skin.
that's just my life
definitely want to try the other drops.
it's definitely part of my everyday routine now.
they would probably be great to mix in with your primer for added illumination as well
it looks so nice on my skin
this helps me tremendously
or make my makeup look weird
not so light that it still leaves your skin feeling tight
everything makes me break out
it definitely gives a matte finish immediately so at first i felt like i wasn't getting enouh moisture
i think that because it is gel-like
8 can definitely say it's helped keep my oils down
man does it feel good once it sinks in all the way =
i can say that this moisturizer really helped my skin
this guy not only helped reduce redness
it's also really nice under makeup
i just knew it felt good
it is such a great product i find myself reaching for it every morning
so wanted something light
it's always been very hard for me to find a moisturizer that i can put on under my makeup that does its job
we all have our "dream" product that we wish for all our lives
that being said...so this was a great bb cream.
i like that there is something like this for men.
had a very hard time
looks like i'm wearing nothing on my face
it feels so light on the skin with amazing coverage
this stuff is the bomb.
i love how it makes my skin feel
does the job well that i was looking to get done.
my skin actually loves this one
wanted to try something different for my aging skin
i wanted a product with a good spf to wear under my foundation
i've started really investing in my skin
it certainly seems to work in both areas
i really feel like my skin looks clearer
this face cream works pretty well
which i never really found before with their creams
ever since using this cream i always get asked what i have been using on my skin because it gives this indescribable firmness
i think it is a good investment for a product with spf that stays on my face all day
my skin is really important to me
i really liked the glow that moisterizer gave me
it absorbs really well into my skin.
how great it is for me to say that?
people comment about how good my skin looks
it really is that good
i could smile without feel me skin tighten.
honestly my skin has never looked so good before
because we’re lucky enough to have really smart people working in our labs
help to us to truly rejuvenate skin
it makes my skin feel
i really see some improvement
so i have a pretty good opinion on it.
so this eye cream had some pretty huge claims
my mom loves it as well
i noticed the difference pretty quickly.
love this stuff, pricey but it works
he said that he noticed it too
even if you have very bad wrinkles
as i have seen for myself
it did such a great job on his tattoo
i think my skin has really shown an improvement.
always feel like my jar never contains enough
i feel that it helps my primer
my skin feels so good after applying this in the morning
i guess i realized that because something works on a lot of people
this product has done wonders for my skin.
feel such a difference in my face
i would definitely recommend
she constantly comments on how good her skin feels
he face just feels so good now
it works well for me
without showing me what product it was
this has done wonders for my skin.
i do find that my skin looks brighter
i've got to say that i really do like it
i definitely found that in this product.
i definitely compared it to others
the only reason why my face was feeling like that was because it was super dry
it has done wonders for my skin
it's hard to find something that my skin loves
it has a strange feel when applying
one of the best things is that you don't have to use very much
people always ask what is my skin care regimen
you really get your money's worth of the product thanks to the texture
this is a bouncy gel that feels so good going on at night
i feel it's really softening my skin.
like i said i have tried everything
i've never found a face cream i actually love.
i could still feel a light bit of the moisturizer hanging on to my skin
not sitting on top of it or feeling like a film
i love that it absorbs right in
at first i thought the sake infused products was a bit of a gimmick
i find myself wanting to touch my face
the product is so great if you don't have a reaction to it
the stuff that actually works
this, i have learned, and i'm okay with it.
i feel like it evened out my skin tone
it's just been really really pleasant to use
the results are pretty awsme
my skin look realy good and healthly!
love the feel of the balm on my face.
soooo my skin has been awful for a year
this cream really did make a difference in how my face looks
it actually feels like it is working plumping up my skin
i love how the balm has a bounce to it
i just got the tonic water so hopefully i love that just as much
this moisturizer does really well for the price
this one felt like it really penetrated my skin.
i love how this feels on my skin!!
i still love the product
and i would definitely recommend this product.
i am definitely going to keep buying this creme for a looonnnngggg time
sadly just started taking care of my skin
makes my face feel so smooth
i love putting it on because it makes my skin feel so smooth
i gave this a shot after not being real happy with how my pores are showing alot of texture
what a nice difference just after first use
it just feels so amazing when i wake up in the morning
my complexion has never looked so good
been helping me maintain when i have my breakouts here
will definitely be buying this if it keeps working like this
i think it does improve my eyes in the morning
this stuff feels good and smells good too though.
certainly beats using nothing at all
definitely my go to eye cream now.
on mornings when my eyes are really puffy this stuff is a lifesaver
have a hard time finding eye creams that work for me
my eyes were really starting to show my age
when my eye get tired from a long days work it's very soothing
it made my eyes feel more awakened in a sense
i always have dark circles in the morning
this stuff makes it so when i wake up in the morning
it looks like i received a great night's sleep even when i don't
after a good month you can really tell the difference
i always thought to myself samples don't do anything you need at least a couple samples of a product to really see a difference
everyone around me also did
i am definitely going to buy this eye cream!
the woman at sephora told me this would have more hydrating effects so we went with the creme
makes your eyes feel that way too
i feel revitalized once this stuff goes on!
they have lifted my eyes tremendously
it seems to do the job just fine
i think it has made a difference
it work perfectly with me
it really makes a difference.
make sure you keep it in a cool place though this cream is not made to h
however, it has really helped my dark circles.
i saw how much good it was really doing for me
asking if i was alright
i honestly see a difference myself.
feels nice to put on even in the summer time
feels so nice to spread on your skin
the things that really age a woman
with continued use you defintely see a more rested look
i can really tell the difference
am always sure not to be without it
thank you irene for suggesting it for my skin needs
this is truly the only eye cream that i have ever tried that really helps with dark circles
i do know that it feels good when i use it
i think that's hard to tell
will definitely keep using.
like get a decent amount of sleep
good for sensitive skincons: no real change in fine lines versatilei will admit up front that i do not have a lot of experience with eye creams
you will feel a little cool
i think it really works on puffiness
it really does make my tired eyes look better.
i don't really know if it took care of my dark circles
it makes my eyes so nice
i don't look tired all the time
i really doubt that there is a cream on the market that can get rid of dark circles
i really like this product
this eye cream is really light
it really keeps those bags under
because of the way i smile
this is wonderful if you have realy dry skin around the eye areas
overall i do love it.
did a good job for my eyes
it makes my eyes feel great
i like this prodcut a lot.
i feel like it's working
try it for myself
then again i don't expect skincare to be wondrous plus im using this as a preventative measure rather than a treatment as im still pretty young so like yeah except for the pilling it is nice
i really like the smell it make me feel relax.
i love the way it makes my skin look and feel.
it is definitely a good weight for combination skin
loved the smell and the way it made my face feel.
probably not great for the summer
i am definitely going to buy this for my mom though
not a big deal for me
the way this feels on my face
i can see a difference in my skin
definitely going on my christmas list
you need to apply very little which i love.
i can feel a big difference in the softness of my skin
your face feels so smooth all day
i can definitely tell the difference
it's really great for skin that can be a bit sensitive
was always talking about this "precious" cream that he tried
i love how it makes my face feel
even commented that my skin was really beautiful
it makes me feel like the product if full of fake stuff
i will say my skin felt tighter
this one really works
dont care for version with sunsceen cause it feels different
it feels like heaven on my face
it feels like heaven on your face.
i really like this one but i'm not using it now.
and i really like to reuse this one !!
so finding a moisturizer that actually feels comfortable
this is one that works well for me
it will make your skin feel softer than you've ever felt
keep your skin looking young
during the fall, it gets really bad.
i still love it
there is no other one that makes my skin looks so good
looking nice when i'm not getting enough sleep
there really is something going on with this secret ingredient
this cream just works on all my issues.
you can feel good making this purchase
what a difference in my skin.
everyone who has used it loves it!
cool, different kind of product feel.
makes your face feel nice
little did i know i was going to buy my new favorite face wash
love this stuff and smells so good!
i feel like this cleans my skin so well
my skin likes these
this just makes it feel well
i really love this product
it was pretty rad
they really did this well
i loved how this makes my skin feel.
definitely will be trying the other types as well
it feels so refreshing
i really love this stuff
it really controls my breakouts
i really like that this is a quick mask that takes less
it really does the trick when my skin is looking a little drab
this product has worked really well
this definitely made me feel refreshed.
in turn i feel like i'm not breaking out as much
i really love that it's 2 products in one
really saves me a little bit of time to get amazing skin
i think you will love it too!
smells so pretty and feels so soothing.
i can feel the texture of my skin improve so much
this is very weird face wash.
you definitely need patience.
i get my face good
i still really like it
my only thing is i wish it was a bigger tube though lol i am going through this stuff fast lol
thought i'd have to use a lot
i love these because you can mix
these products are very nice on your skin.
i love the idea of being able to use a mask everyday
it just makes my skin feel really clean to put my day skin care on
you really have to figure out the best way to use these for your skin type
having all three is good if you have combo skin.
so great leaves my face refresh i recommend you get it if you have combination skin
they are perfect for someone like me who likes to do several masks a week
the more i used it the better i felt like it worked specially when my skin needs a fast facial gets all of my makeup residue off
these are nice and thick and really help my skin.
not just the quality of my skin
i love the way my face feels after this mask.
i still feel the benefits
learned that the hard way
or it never really feels as though it really cleanses
it always feels clean
i really like them
so when i had some friends meeting up for a week of fun
worked out really well!
i love the way my skin feels when i use any one of these
i feel like the tone
i love the way all three of them make my skin feel
this is so fun to use.
the foaming part makes you really feel like you are getting all your makeup/dirt off your face
i do feel like they're a good value for the money
i don't feel like they do any hard core treatments of the skin either
it feels so great going onto the skin
you really don't have to use a whole lot to get full coverage
went out on a limb to try it because i only like foaming cleanser as i feel they are actually doing something
just right for me
it feels amazing when you put it on your skin!
it makes me want to wash my face more because it makes my skin feel so great
the best part was that my face felt hydrated when i was done
really love how clean it makes my skin feel
i don't feel it's very firming though
i also feel good using this product because of the ingredients
it was the only thing i noticed when id look in the mirror
really improved the look of my under eyes
i love to try new things
feel flawless for days
this did really made difference in my skin.
i am really hoping not because the product works.
i can feel it help firm my skin around my eyes
it has really changed my skin
i love how it feels
i can really tell a difference when i don't use this under my normal moisturizer
really noticed the difference
so makeup adheres really well to it
the gold sparkle is really pretty when you pump it out
love how my skin looks when i use it
what really bothered me most of all
i will definitely keep using it.
that said, i really like this product.
thought i liked it
well the dispenser is not so good
i don't think it lasts very long
yeah, this product is that good.
i've always had problem skin.
i make sure too really massage this product into my skin well
this works for me
my skin has never looked so amazing!
this stuff really works on crows feet
i can get my whole face
one pad really allows me to "treat" my face
how my skin looks
for me they're a good investment because i'm seeing results
it is really light
that`s how i got to know it
love the feel on my face
i actually really liked this face lotion!
you guys should try it
this is so good for eyes that don't have age problems
in a really stupid smile
feel good when you roll it under your eyes
it's pretty, fun to put on and peel off!
i really love this product.
my skin looks so good
i've never felt anything like it.
it's really difficult to explain
i've never felt anything like it
i think i've always tried to talk myself into thinking the products i use work
yeah now that you mention it definitely
it just drinks this stuff up
was having a really hard time finding the right products that worked for me
soothing feeling to my skin when nothing else would
i would definitely recommend putting it under a moisturizer
my skin has been freaking out
as i sometimes feel that i've tried everything
trying this stuff i knew i had too
put it on it felt very soothing
the rebound redness for me was so awful
nothing works quite like this
i love that too
that works for me
is hard to get out
i really like this product!
just enough for it to feel nice on my skin
the beads make my face feel really fresh
it's got a really nice texture
i really like that it really hydrates
i feel like my skin actually looks better when i use this
i cant feel it "sitting" on my skin
my skin just feel so rich
i love that it is all in one
i guess it's hard for me to differentiate which aspect is helping what
lancer is really on to something here don't pass it up
this stuff has really improved the texture of my skin
it's really helped me improve my skin's tone
the feel of the skin on my face
it definitely has a tingle when you apply
the results clearly proved me wrong--this stuff really works to reduce brown spots/sun damage
because i love how it is helping my skin
i love the way it feels on my skin
this is the only thing that truly helped
i think it helps balance out your skin
i love the rest of the products in the ceramidin line because they really are deeply hydrating
i've seriously never been so obsessed with a product
this stuff is gold for me.
it gives you a lot of product.
so maybe that makes a difference
i really do like this moisturizer
my face was definitely less red
the scent is really nice too.
wanted to try something different
i would really like to try try the oil balm.
definitely recommend checking it out.
this would probably be a great 24/7 cream for you
i really like it
i feel like my face looks brighter
although i would definitely use moisturizer as well
i will say i felt like i looked "younger" today
i like the huge difference it's made on my neck.
as i was spreading this deliciousness all over my face i was thinking how it felt unlike anything i've ever put on my face before
i love how my face feels after using this.
you can feel it with the texture
it makes my face feel really great
it is actually so funny
this stuff is like a hug for my skin.
i feel this cleanser has changed the game for me
now my skin has always been good
i think this is is a really nice basic cleanser.
its actually really gentle on the skin
i love to use this product in the morning because the smell is so amazing
you can really smell the m
even my boyfriend could feel the difference
i honestly don't mind the extra wash considering how good the foreo luna feels on your face
it has done wonders for my skin
definitely recommend this product!
my skin seems to really drink this product right up
none of those are that great to me
my face feels so good
i really like this product.
i really liked it
it kinda feel like when you been on your water drinking game
your skin is just thanking you
i would definitely recommend this product!
always make sure you wash your h
this stuff is amazing and smells even better!!
love it and got my mom hooked too
my skin feels very good the next morning.
still love my boscia luminizing mask
my makeup has never looked so good after doing this mask
i will definitely buy this mask
it feels really nice.
feels good to wear all day
that's it for my whole face
smell is just kind of there
using this help a whole lot.
it actually goes on very light
i find myself reaching for this moisturizer just as often as those other items that i knew i already liked
cheeks were horrible this product is really working
am getting very little sleep
doesn't really smell good or bad
others have been commenting on how great my skin is looking as well
i feel like i have to leave a review here if only because it seems so many women have had a hard time with this moisturizer
this stuff not only glides on like a dream
it makes me so sad to see that it isn't receiving great reviews
it finally made my skin feel good!
it just shows you how different everyones skin can be
it really goes a long way
my skin just feels
then i tried the night balm which is nice
i definitely get some
my face feels so smooth now
it's super natural which is probably why my skin is doing so great with it
it really does feel like it locks in moisture better than any other moisturizer i've used
loved it so much i decided to get another one using my 100 point perks
my skin loves me for it
it works for me
this one has really no scent to it at all
i like how it makes my skin feel
i wasn't sure if this "natural" moisturizer was going to work for me
i really liked it.
i really wanted to like this
since my skin is very dry right now i do need something extra at night
love the way it makes me skin look throughout the day
it feels really lightweight going on
it has done something really nice to my skin- my face feels firm
i figured i'd give rise 'n shine a whirl to see if it really did stick around
this has really balanced out my skin
this stuff is a miracle.
i did a ton of research on a product that would help with the redness around my nose that's always been there
i really liked this stuff.
i've loved seeing it all go away
i pretty much gave up until a rep told me about this product
'm really picky when it comes to skin care
love how my face looks
i think it really does help mask the lines in my face
i really like this product!
everyday kind of things here
i wasn't expecting a whole lot from this product
when i feel like i'm about to have a break-out i stop all the other skins products
i really do notice a difference
i would definitely recommend this product
i wanted to see how they all worked together
it makes my makeup feel light
i love everything about it
well, let me say this is my favorite right now.
this product really helps to even out your skin tone
i feel like this deserves attention as it removes all of my makeup
together they feel amazing.
it actually makes my whole bathroom smell like it
the bar is actually pretty st
it's not so great for my face
it really has helped with my skin
it just looks so pretty
i like the idea of having a bar soap like this that does the job with ingredients which are good for the skin
i think that this difference is why this works amazingly for some people
why would you want a super strong smelling face product anyway?
wanted something that was natural
because this stuff is 1
feel like a treat for your skin
'm not sure what it is
it definitely helps with acne i always get breakouts on my chin
it really seems to work
my skin hasn't looked this good in quite some time
it instantly made my skin feel and look better!
so definitely a good buy
i could cry cause this stuff has been a life saver
this stuff is so fun!
it really helps my acne prone
i truly think this has helped
i feel like the oil is contesting my t zone a little though
i look forward to trying those as well
my one complaint is i am not a huge fan of the smell
it's something i can certainly deal with to have beautiful skin
started getting comments on how good my skin looked
i hardly ever feel like anything is great enough to put in that kind of effort
years of all that other stuff
i think it actually helps clear the breakouts
i can see this working really well for people with drier skin
you only need a couple of drops for your whole face
both have really really strong smells that lingers for hours
my skin has cleared up tremendously
my skin looks pretty good these days because of retin-a
my skin looks amazing even with out make up which is crazy
i really don't need to touch up my make up
this stuff is a miracle for me.
i love it and i can see what the big deal is!
so that says something
i always had a hard time finding azulene oil
imagine this to last me quite some time
it never made sense to me
really even steven's out my skin tone too.
these people make good stuff.
they are all so amazing
now that you know my skin type
i really feel this product helped me a lot
i mean super well
i for one don't really like it
but the lapis oil just really does it for me.
i really love this stuff.
i always thought acne was something you only had to deal with as a teenager
this honestly kept me matte with a velvet feel all day
no joke, this stuff is magic.
that i don't feel the need to wear foundation all the time
said i should try it- glad i did because it's awesome
'm thinking that for the warmer seasons i'll be using lapis
it also removes makeup really well if you use a bunch
my face hasn't looked this good in years
this is definitely my favourite out of all of them
take it with me everywhere
i love the whole line of drunk elephant it really has changed my skin
love the way it makes my skin feel
so when i first picked this oil up i was a little worried it wouldn't be hydrating enough for me
feel a difference in my skin
i never felt like my skin was improving i just felt like i was maintaing it
as i have a hard time putting something that smells funky on my face
this is the first face oil that really works for me
i really like what this does for my skin
'm sure i'll get used to it
finding a face oil that doesn't make me look like an oil slick right after i apply it is really hard
it works really well for combination skin.
i really wanted to love this oil
i really liked it
wow am i glad he got this one instead
it was so so discouraging feeling like my pimples were just adding up
hopefully the lapis works for me too
my skin has always been pretty much good
my skin got really dull
personally i would rather pay the price for a product that is pure with awesome ingredients
this stuff serious business
my face feels so comfortable
am telling all my friends how ridiculously good it is
'm always on a mission to find a good facial oil that actually works
i love how it feels when i put it on
purchased this oil after hearing so many great things about the br
t really does the job as a moisturizer for me
i honestly don't see a need to try the rodin now--i'm that happy with this stuff
i really wanted to love this oil
i think i feel this on my skin the most because i'm aware of the smell
remember that it is there
i think you would like this a lot
when i wake up, my skin looks and feels amazing.
will definitely keep using this product
so this particular oil seemed like a good option
honestly my skin has never looked better
herbivore really thought of everything.
it always looks good
protecting my skin never felt so good
i always get compliments on how great my skin looks
this oil makes my face feel so nice
this stuff has been a miracle for my skin.
i feel that this would work with any skin type
it's kinda hard to explain
all i have to say is if you want your skin to look/feel like a baby
nothing in my life ever made my face feel so soft
no really i mean amazing
i would definitely recommend this oil.
it makes me feel like a princess!
plump dream skin you've always wanted
i actually really enjoyed this mask.
know it's definitely working
it really does brighten my face
this product is so beautiful in so many ways.
the all-natural ingredients really do make this product one to st
i feel like i'm using less makeup because i'm so happy with the way my skin looks
goes on like a dream
took the chance because i had this really good feeling about it
i liked it as a mask
honestly i think this stuff works better as a spot treatment
they work really well together.
have always struggled with acne
i will definitely keep using this.
another thing that i love about this is how little of the product you have to use
it really has been a game changer for my skin
the mask is so dang good.
im definitely starting to notice improvements in my skin
i feel like i'm going through my jar kind of fast
i quite enjoy the smell of this.
i think it definitely brightens
it's a little weird at first
my skin was freaking out
it really worked like magic.
it makes your skin feel nice
i also like using this mask before makeup so my foundation can go on nice
it has honestly changed my face!
i genuinely do i have healthier
so here we are
let me say that this mask will give you everything from incredibly smooth skin
i've never had my skin feel so smooth after a mask
i actually enjoy it now
i actually really love it
for the past couple years i've had really bad acne which led to really bad scarring which led me to try so many different products to try
my skin is something that used to make me cry
i happen to like the smell a lot
i've never really been the type to be wowed by a product
i find it alright
i actually enjoy the smell
the wonderful effect it has on my face will keep me me coming back to this product
this product has definitely helped
i always play it safe
'm always on the lookout for good new products
i feel as if my skin looks brighter
feel like that's a good endorsement
i feel like it's going to last me forever because you really don't need much
this stuff is so fun!
feels like i'm putting not-quite-ready jello on my face
've tried a lot of products
i don't care because the mask works so good
i actually asked my mom to touch my face
it felt like a baby's
i feel like when i use this product it really exfoliates
let me get this out of the way: this smells awful
my skin looks so good while using this!
this stuff is the real deal.
you definitely feel it "working
you can really feel the cleaning effect it has!
t's very hard to tell if you're using enough
definitely my new favourite mask
feel like i had to for this
sounds harsh i know
only because i was doing other things
i feel like i'm giving away a secret here
i actually like how it smells on my face now
it felt like i had a whole new face.
this stuff made a difference
s are hard on skin folks
seems like its doing a lot
i love how this mask makes my skin feel!
i definitely think this mask is very gently
i imagine that if you don't love the fragrance you won't love this mask as the smell is very strong
i decided to try this stuff
this stuff instantly works!!
i love how my skin feels after using
i definitely think it helps clear up blemishes quickly
will definitely keep using!
this really strikes a balance
that always gives me great results i have no issue with $48
you definitely want to start with the 3 day routine
anyway this mask is amazing.
i personally like the smell of it
told them how much i loved it
it actually feels nice
some pretty serious ones on my cheeks right now
i will definitely keep using this stuff.
i felt like i needed to for herbivore's products
in a decade of trying to find the right skin care my face has never looked so good
i can definitely see why this stuff is too harsh if you have very fair sensitive skin though
i definitely recommend if you have mild acne
it's a good thing it works so well
you definitely have to get past the smell
this is amazing for when i feel like new breakouts are coming on
this stuff is the bomb!
makes my face feel amazing afterward
the only thing that keeps my skin clear!
i'll start off by saying that i have pretty good skin overall
le pretty much anything i put on it
i didn't see a whole lot of difference in my fine lines or dark circles bags under my eyes
because i love this stuff
i feel it does reduce mine a bit
as someone who has tried a lot of eye products to tackle my ever present dark circles i wanted to say that this stuff made a difference in 2 nights
that was enough for me to see that this product really does what it says
then i got my makeup done
i noticed a difference in my under eye area pretty quickly
love the way it feels.
it also gives me just the right amount of moisture
i must say i as really liking it
looks like i found the one for me
i can already feel a difference
love how it feels cold when i put it on.
i do think it helps a bit with undereye darkness as well
this is just a really solid eye cream that i highly recommend for those who want something light
i really like this eye cream.
i wasnt really having expectations
my eyes do actually feel brighter
i never had really bad dark circles
but so far i really do love it.
i know you aren't supposed to put eye creams really close to your eyes
the best part is that the discoloration under my eyes is basically gone now
i love how light this product feels on.
this stuff is out of this world
a little really does go a very long way.
finding a good eye cream for me was very hard since i did not want anti-aging or any cream that was harsh on my skin
never really use eye creams
i really love it
defiantly gonna purchase the whole thing.
i quite like the look of it actually.
i like this as it is light
it makes my eye area look
which has been a hard find for me
i am really liking farmacy.
i actually use it on my whole face as a moisturizer
made me feel better i was using an eye cream
works really well under makeup
will definitely keep using
it really does work
not only is the packaging really nice
the packaging is also really cute.
i really like the way it makes my under eye feels
to my surprise it actually started working about 2
doesn't have a scent, and goes on really nice.
as i have always liked to use two eye creams at a time
wow for the price you get a lot of product
this is a nice eye cream for nighttime imo because it does not work well under my makeup
which i do love as well
at $65 this stuff is a steal.
would breakout pretty regularly
quite frankly it's been a game changer for my skin
then immediately kind of feel like you look better
i do feel my skin is brighter
the only downfall really is that it smells.
feels amazing when you put it on your skin
i really like the smell of it
my skin hasn't looked or felt this good my entire life
for the price i need it to wow me
i especially love this
my skin feels so good after i started using this.
i just told them to go get this stuff.
your face will feel so good after consistent use.
that's why it works so well
for those who want it to smell nice like fruit
i know that's hard to believe
my skin hasn't looked this good ever.
i'd say i'm pretty in love
this definitely brightens up my skin
it just looks so good on my skin
god its was about time for me to find something for my skin
other than that it really is a great product
good genes did nothing for me
my skin never felt better.
i don't know who sold their soul for this product to be so great
because i've honestly tried sooo many
i've never felt like they livedup to the hype
so we expect it to smell like citrus
this product has really helped with my skin issues
to be honest the first time i used it i felt a little nauseated
i started breaking out pretty bad
i love how it seems like someone turned on the light in my skin
it's difficult for me to try new things because i am so scared of the reaction my skin will give
i know my skin
i love the feel
by the time i got home my face would feel tighter
the results are amazing since my skin breaks out to about 97% of things i put on it
i definitely see an improvement in my skin's texture
you definitely get what you pay for with this!
so most of my things naturally have pretty good reviews
i can definitely see a difference if i go without for a few weeks because my skill just looks dull
i do know that it creates the sort of 'radiance from within' feel
that goes away pretty quick
it seems like it
i feel like my skin is brighter too.
i love this a lot.
i love that you can tell it is the real deal because it is a bit sticky
on the first day of me wearing this i can definitely feel a more firm face
as for the smell, there really is no smell.
it honestly gives my skin a brighter appearance
i feel good on days when i'm not wearing any makeup which is amazing
honestly it's very faint in my opinion
i also feel like a lot of products make you skin feel great while they are on or in the immediate future
this one really seems to be improving the quality of my skin
than something that smells pretty
that being said, i actually like the scent.
i think it's pretty smooth
it does wear off pretty fast
i guess my skin got used to this gentle
i am in love with this stuff.
this stuff compared to good genes for me is no comparison
this is good stuff - wakes your skin up!
you kind of get what you get
you know when you're using it that's it all great for your skin
my skin is glowing every day i have people telling me how great my skin looks even when i have absolutely no make up on
just because i touched my lips a little with it i felt a weird taste
does not smell very nice
to be honest i got compliments that my face looks fresh
i think that someone with oily skin would really love the feel of this product
'm not sure about the claim of it being a moisturizer/primer in one
the amazing thing with sephora is if you buy something
this stuff is so amazing i wanted to tell people about it
i got this in my play box and loved it.
you don't want to feel like you're wearing a mask all day long
this is definitely my go-to
i really like this moisturizer
i think i will keep looking
i feel like it evened out my tone a bit before i put any color over it
this product has such a refreshing feel
anyway got this gel as she wanted something light
can attest that sephora really knows how to pick their new products
it definitely looks and feels like whipped gel.
i love how this feels on my skin.
my skin thanks me for you using it.
a perfect product to incorporate into your morning routine for days where you're not really doing anything
the combination have done wonders for my complexion
not fun to use though
its really fun to use so you almost want to wash your face at the end of the night
that's how my skin feels after i wash it off simply amazing
i liked it because it was smooth
all in all for my skin i feel like i still have yet to find the perfect facewash
this was definitely not a bad choice or purchase
i love how light it is.
i actually really like this cleanser.
'm using it just at morning
also good for days where you want to feel extra clean
makes me giggle each time i use it because the foamy texture is so fun to start the day off
it does a really good job in terms of a regular cleanser
i feel like a get a good clean
this works really good on my skin.
so much fun to use!
i just started getting into k-beauty because of that reason
it isn't meant to remove make-up guys
i really enjoy using this cleanser.
this stuff just works for me
he loves the way it makes his skin look
my skin feels so good after using it
it feels great putting on as well as my face after i use it
i personally think it takes off makeup fairly well
i really liked the foamy consistency
it's pretty decent at getting off makeup
just not quite the right fit for my skin
makes it a little hard to put on without getting in your hair
the foam is really fun to put on your face
i got this as a gift and i'm liking it.
i also really like the smell of it.
the application i think is a lot of fun
this makes it so much fun
they go perfectly together
i am definitely not a daily make up girl so this works fine for me :
i also love the way my skin feels when i wash it off
it feels very light for me
really love this product!!!
it really does the job leaves my skin nice a smooth
this makes my skin feel amazing
no matter what i used my skin would feel so dry
this product is great because my skin feels clean yet not dried out
there is no smell to it which is nice because i also don't like things that smell too strong
it really does feel like shaving cream on your face
the foam is so much fun
i love this stuff it's so amazing it's a great way to get rid of acne
so this works when you're tight for time
smells really good too!
i think it was a very good purchase
i really wanted to see what the hype was about all of the k beauty products comin out
i just tried it tonight and i love it!
this mask is alright
my skin was pretty irritated before i did this mask
i really love the way this mask feels
how much fun it is to use
i love the way it makes my skin feel after
i really love this product
i really loved this stuff, my skin sucked it up.
feeling a difference in my skin
love the whole line.
i like a lot of them
some are just okay
friends think i've had work done.
you can feel and see the change !
the feel, the smell, the results are amazing.
so this stuff is amazeeeey!
it feels very good under my eyes too
i like this, i really do!
i noticed this does make a difference for me
it's been sitting in my "loves" for a while
i can't remember a time my skin here has looked this good
this stuff is actually good.
honestly love this stuff.
it took a solid 3 weeks for me to see a difference so just fyi keep that in mind
this stuff really works
it is definately an eye changer if you have the money
for me this works so well what a difference
it really does work.
i felt like i wasn't seeing a difference
this stuff is working for me
would definitely recommend this product.
you can feel it working
i loved this stuff
i would definitely recommend!
i love that this one goes all the around my eyes
it definitely brightens up the area
made me look really awake
seriously it felt so nice on my face
i can definitely tell a difference
this product is great to use every day before makeup as it does not create a greasy feel
overall i think it's a pretty good product.
however i feel like i have to put a lot on for my under eye area to stay hydrated throughout the day
i find i need to use quite a bit of product to take care of both eyes
i really saw a difference
i find myself feeling like my lips not only look fuller
i can physically feel them more when i'm talking
it sure worked for me
if you want something to work fast
i really can see a difference
when i really got convinced was when people at work started complimenting my face
"so clean" "so even" "great skin"
even my mom said it
i really needed to try something that worked fast
some work great for you, others don't do a thing.
you got to have this thing ladies!
this stuff really works
i never thought it was going to work as well
i really love this product
totally worth it if you want even skin tone
was looking back at photos of how great my skin looked
this stuff definitely works
this stuff actually works!
bad thing is when you grow up people start calling them 'age spots'
i truly think even with being in the sun
i take good care of my skin
if you don't have a good experience with this product though
i hope you get as good of a result as i did!
this stuff is like a miracle product!
heck who needs makeup with this routine!
i guess you have to be very consistent with it !
you definitely have to use it consistently.
because i have such a good impression from this item
realized i really would like to have even skin
i feel comfortable walking around with little to no makeup because the redness is almost completely gone
can get a feel for the overall difference from when i started
it works really fast
i've always had good skin
around a big season change my skin always breaks out
i try to use this a lot because it really works.
which i always thought was pretty good
i feel like this is one of the only one cleansers that really made a difference on my skin
nothing really seemed to work
it's helped tremendously with my kp when i used it everyday straight for about 2 weeks
make sure you moisturize really well after using this
definitely give it a try!
i give this product 5 stars because nothing else has worked for me
it has definitely cleared my skin
has been doing wonders to my skin
it is still working so well for me
always makes my face look
my husband even likes it so we share.
my skin loves this stuff.
really good for my acne prone skin
the little micro beads really put in work
feel like i get just as good
i honestly just really love this cleanser.
i feel that this cleanser is perfect for all of those issues
i talk about the stuff all the time
my skin is so smooth now that i kind of forget how well it worked in the beginning
give this stuff a try!
i really like how clear it has my skin looking
how smooth it feels when i use it
just felt like my skin could look better
this stuff is a miracle.
really recommend this for someone struggling to overcome these issues
i've always struggled with acne
they feel different and amazing.
wanted to go a bit without wearing foundation
it provides just enough exfoliation to feel like its doing something without over doing it
i love the combination of acids in this as well i feel like it really cleans deep down
something i look for
my skin just feel sooo smooth
at first i thought this would not do a great job as the scrub has very small
it's hard to find a product that has both
i really love this cleanser.
before this product i always felt like there was never enough lotion on the planet to quench my face
just for the heck of it
still not as good as i would like
you really don't need a lot to wash your whole face
i don't really find that it makes much of a difference
it definitely gets the job done
i love this product as it is just right for me
it makes me feel
i love the way it makes my face look also love the little beads in it
it does make your face feel tight
i will definitely say i've seen great improvements
i think this paired with a spot treatment will do wonders
look so glowy so for now i'll stick to this
my boyfriend:bf: he loves it
my skin can look a bit tired
it does give me a great flush afterwards
definitely recommend following it with a good moisturizer--
i do like it a lot
i can definitely tell a huge difference in the texture of my skin
i myself didn't notice a different until my close friends started pointing out that my skin got better
have only noticed good things
it works really well for me
which is great because i think my regular cleanser tells me to keep away from the eye area
i need to do both because the caudalie removes my tough make up
make sure you do add a bit of water
has everything i need!
i've tried a bunch because i'm always searching for the next great thing
i really like the smell of it as well.
this step makes a huge difference since you're giving the product some time to work with your skin
just to make sure i get everything off
it works pretty well
nothing has ever made my skin feel so wonderful.
makes me so sad to see this product have bad reviews because i love it
i've heard so many amazing things about this br
i really wanted to love it
knowing how ridiculously marked up it is
this stuff gets everything off
but this stuff is the bomb.
it really feels like it gets everything off pretty well
i definitely recommend it.
i feel like i'm going to feel annoyed when i have to keep buying bottles
seriously takes everything off
this stuff takes it all off
i'd like to give it 5 stars
the only problem was that they always left a weird film over my eyes
my face felt so nice after.
it feels so nice on my skin
removes make up really well also
trust me there's always more
have to say this does a great job
this stuff really aids in clearing my skin
my face doesn't feel tight afterwards
definitely a staple in my skin care routine.
so thought i'd give it a try
i really love this cleanser.
it also makes my skin feel so smooth
definitely love this product
still felt like my skin could improve
loving the feel it gave my skin
i like it a lot.
i know the price is a bit up there
it's great for stuff and things for your face
i don't feel right
sure enough it worked
this product really did prevent my breakouts.
my skin has never been the type to get terrible acne
i think i've found the one
it's amazing i felt a chance in my skin.
i love this it keeps me skin clear.
i do still get acne here
this stuff is seriously so good
if i was more consistent with it i'm sure my skin would be completely clear
this cleanser has really made the difference
it probably won't work as well for everybody
i love the way it feels on your face
it just feels like it really does clean
this has done wonders for my skin!
i will tell you what my skin care consults told me
always have had trouble finding a cleanser that works for me
i talked with our sephora team they gave me a little sample of this product
my acne was so bad i would cry about it
i absolutely love this cleanser for my acne-prone skin i feel like it does a great job of cleaning my skin without making it feel stripped
since using this i feel like my skin looks brighter
still getting breakouts in my 40s is just plain unfair
i actually quite like it.
this is really the only one that helps
makes me feel so clean
nothing seemed to be working.
i also love the feeling of my skin after i use this
i really love what it has done
i would recommend you definitely give this a try!
definitely recommend this 2 any1 with bad breakouts
definitely will continue to buy this product it has an interesting citrusy smell so be mindful of you don't like face products smelling
over a great product for people with acne i bet this would be especially good on someone with really acne prone skin
i think between this
for myself i don't have a big problem with acne
i would definitely recommend it
right after using i definitely feel that my skin is super fresh
like it is doing its job
keep trying to find what works for you
i always had clear skin
i never really used it before
because my acne was never that bad
this product has really helped clear up my skin.
it makes my face feel so clean!
i can definitely see a difference in my acne with this
it was pretty gross
has really helped control my breakouts
i feel like it does a great job cleaning.
which when you have acne is a big help
only thing that works for my skin
i also love way my skin feels after using it.
i definitely recommend this product!
still bad enough that i needed to wear makeup to feel slightly good about myself
they definitely got me
had me thinking it would be my luck
i want others who struggle with this nasty thing called acne to feel the relief i do from using this
i really think it's a miracle!
i really like this product.
i actually feel like my face is clean after using it
i really like the clay mask by murad too in conjunction with this
it really helped clear my skin up!
i really like this product.
it makes my face feel very clean without feeling very dry like most products make me feel
i really recommend this product to people struggling with acne
i always feel my skin clean
people always ask how i keep my skin clear
wanted to be sure that it would play well with the nars eye primer
it worked really well for me
this stuff is so good
i think it's pretty good stuff.
what worked for me was using very little at a time
love how my skin is looking.
this one is definitely a keeper.
my skin never felt softer going to bed
loved how my skin felt after using it
my skin has never felt softer.
it works for me
everyone's skin is different- this just happens to be the *best* thing for mine
what i am ashamed of is how many products it takes to get it all off
this one actually works really well
it's also pretty hydrating which i really need
it feels so nice going on
if you can afford it or feel like getting yourself a gift
this stuff is really good for removing makeup
making your skin feel good
okay i am obsessed with this product i wasn't sure how i'd feel about this because of the "oily" feel it leaves on the skin afterwards
they are a nice little massaging bonus
the feel of my skin afterwards
i don't get the smell everyone keeps raving about
it makes my skin feel amazing
this is important as that's how your makeup will come all the way off
i don't wear a whole lot of make up
i didn't feel that it did a great cleansing job at night
i love that stuff too!
i take care of me
it did a really good job
i really do love this
that's probably because i won't rub this right over my eyes very much
they've really plumped up
i feel like a whole new person
so that is a good thing to keep in mind.
i actually enjoy my evening routine now because of this stuff
i will always repurchase this, it's so amazing!!!
i really liked this balm
this stuff actually makes me look forward to removing makeup at night
it feels so nice on your face too
you can probably find a decent
no matter how nice it feels
everything melts off and feels so nice.
it is definitely a must try
at night is when i take the time to really treat my skin this is something that's always on the counter
it definitely works when i use it to take my makeup off
i love everything about it
it is very firm so until you break through the surface it's a bit hard to work with
i don't feel bad about the price because i leave it on for awhile
it seemed to be doing the job
while i'm not as in love with the texture of this one
i love this stuff so much!
it leaves my skin feeling so nice
i really like this product to leave on for a bit
i still always hated them
i love how this product makes my eyes so smooth.
night which i still really like
makes my skin feel like a baby's
these two paired together actually made a very good team
i don't really smell it
so sad it did not work for me.
this just feels really good as it melts into your skin
it makes my skin feel so smooth afterwards
i like this a lot
it smells so good too!!!
i definitely don't think it has a cocoa smell like the other reviewers said- it has a very light chamomile
since my mom wants something that really do ffirming ang lifting her skin
i can feel my whole face is tightened
i felt like my face looked a lot better
i do really like this
other than that if i keep it away from my eyes i really like it
it's still nice, though.
i definitely love this product especially because it's not heavy
i'll be returning to my real love
i really love this cleanser.
see how it works
i really like this stuff!
i just feel happier after i use this product
this product makes me skin feel so smooth
seems to work well with my combo skin
my skin felt nice after using this product.
it does leave your face feeling really smooth
i feel in love
the price point is also very good for the size you get
i love the way it goes on
it made my skin feel sooo amazing
this smells so good that i look forward to washing my face
don't feel like you need it
i really can't get over how great it smells.
worth it if you feel like treating yourself
i really like it
love that also really feel like i see a bigger difference when i use this with the nuface
i really love this oil!
it felt so good like i was at the spa
i put it in my likes
will leave it there until i feel like splurging on myself
i really liked it
this really does the trick
it did not feel heavy on my face.love it !
let me see what i generally don't like about sleep masks is that they smell really intense
i am definitely going to buy this product!
really you use it as a noisturizer
was fun to apply at night
i feel like i could even wear it during the day.
i am pretty picky about what i wear to sleep
definitely not enough to make your pillow smell weird
this product delivers everything it said it does
this mask really helped it recover
the texture is very different that other mask for sure
it worked really well with hydration especially in the neck area
this sleep mask is so unbelievable that i felt it was warranted
it feels great to know that i have invested in a product that is truly working while i am resting
my aesthetician even commented on how great my skin looks
