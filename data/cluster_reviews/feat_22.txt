wonderful product and well worth the cost.
definitely worth the investment.
i know this is expensive
bought more erno laszio skin care
making it worth the price tag in my opinion
after you use it you will likely buy it again
bought it during the vib sale
price is good compared to other br
but price... so expensive.
the price is really hefty
i love the cream i want to buy the full size however at the current price i think it's unreasonable
i will definitely consider this again during sales or if the price is reduced
if it was 1/2 the price, i would probably get it.
i can't justify paying that much for it :
went back to purchase the product
the price point is really high
jart cicapair cream for less than half the price
i will continue to repurchase
i can't believe i paid $135 for a cream.
i may have to splurge
i like it a lot.. but the price is too steep.
the price is to high for us
unfortunately i can't justify the price.
i wish it was a little more affordable
i will continue to purchase despite the high price
too bad about the price!
so maybe if i save up i will buy a jar to use at bedtime
the only downfall is when looking to find a whole bottle to purchase is the price
maybe as a luxury gift every now and again.
price is out of my budget
i will always find a way to purchase this
i am still having a hard time justifying such a high price
i got online to look at it's full price
this is how i justify purchasing it!
sensitive skin purchase now
worth the price it works!
have already bought more of this
i will never buy another one again
it may be a little pricey
i believe the product would be cheaper if the product line stopped the "gift look" packaging
feel/ absolutely worth every penny
it is worth every penny.
and it is a lot cheaper than la mer's face oil.
we will continue to buy this product.
the results are well-worth the price
i would definitely buy this again
that being said it is 100% worth it
i will be repurchasing when i run out
at first i was a bit skeptical about this product because of the price
was convinced to purchase it
will definitely purchase it again
i would highly recommend splurging on this oil as a little goes a long way
would definitely re-purchase again
i admit the price is steep
i wish they would take the gold flakes out to cut the price
because of how pricey it is
as for the price
this may be expensive, but it's so worth it!
after one use i'm sold
will be purchasing it again when i run out
will buy it again
if you can afford to splurge on this item
will be buying it after this review
is currently priced higher than i think it's worth
probably won't buy again
bought this not expecting much
i never bought into the hype over glamglow products
will be buying again!
i like it enough that i've repurchased it several times
i would definitely repurchase!
even with the expensive price tag that glamglow is known for
i would buy this mask when it goes on sale.
i would defiantly buy this if it weren't so expensive
i don't think i'll be able to purchase this all the time because of the price
it's worth every penny
definitely worth the money!
i will definitely repurchase this product.
t will be easy to remove when time is up so definitely worth the price remember these products are a little pricey
the price is a barrier otherwise i would have purchased a jar already
because it is pricey..
i might buy this again if i have a spare $70.
if the cost isn't an issue for you
i would not recommend this for people on a budget
i'll definitely be buying this again
i will be repurchasing with no regrets
although i am in the market for a product just like this that is maybe more reasonably priced
t is difficult to say if the price is worth it as just a moisturizer
it is worth every penny to keeping my skin looking fresh
definitely worth the money.
i will be returning it to exchange for a another
loyal buyer for life!
therefore is worth it to me
have repurchased many times
the price is reasonable
not bad for the price!
very happy about this product i will buy it again when i finish this bottle
i'll definitely buy it again
will definitely be purchasing
then i decided i had to purchase
am satisfied considering the price
worth a buy if you struggle with dry
i will buy this many time
a bit expensive but this product is worth it.

will buy it forever.
best product i've purchased in a while!

would consider repurchasing after i finish using it
i find it totalllly worth the 100 points!
and the price is great too!
i love this product and will keep buying it.
if you are new to eye creams i think its a good affordable buy
this one is about half the price
i think i'll probably repurchase
i found this cream to be so worth the money.
would definitely purchase again when i finish this first bottle
i am always happy with clinique purchases !
the price is also reasonable compared to other br
this is more in my price range
and i love the price point.
i find this product to be well worth the sort of steep price
well worth the price.
i feel like the active properties will expire too quickly
sephora doesn't sell it yet
for now only tatcha sell it in their website
i decided to splurge on this as a treat yoself.
amazing quality definitely will continue to purchase
therefore making the price point all the better
i will buy it again.
def will be repurchasing.
i wil definitely re-purchase.
when this tube runs out i will buy it again

a worthwhile investment when i think about what i used to spend on acne treatments
it is intensive, it's worth the price tag.
last long for the price.

it is worth every penny.

it's worth that money.
have lost the value for money
is worth this price
but the price tag was a super dewper :/
perhaps during the vibr sale
i realized how expensive it is
so i'm not buying this one.
i really wish this was about half the price
saved it if i would have realized the price
i jumped online to buy some
i can't justify it at that price
not knowing the price tag
with the price i wonder if the charlotte tilbury's wonderglow is better?
excellent value for money
a definite repurchase product for me!

believe i will repurchase again to see if those results continue
this is a great product that i will continue to repurchase
am ready to buy the real deal

the only downside is the price.

i didn't want to risk buying

if i could buy a giant tub of this stuff
i hate the price, though.
the full price for this product is on the more expensive side for an oil

the price is high
the price is high for the amount
i will be definitely buying this!

seriiously, too quick for the price.

the only downside is the packing for me.
at such reasonable price.

totally worth the price
purchased it during the spring sale
been using this since i picked it up from the sephora haul sale
i love it and will be repurchasing.
vib sale made me take the plunge on this
this is worth the price and so much more.
definitely worth the price
this makes me want to buy all of the korres products
this one is worth it
this is one that i'd probably buy again
totally worth the money
will be purchasing another bottle right now
but this product is definitely worth writing for.
do you read 100+reviews before purchasing a product?
i will continue to purchase this whenever i run out
you won't regret this purchase
i will def repurchase after i run out
i will definitely repurchase this oil.
i just recently purchased this product in hopes to find something for my face
absolutely will buy this again
i love this oil and will continue to purchase.
i will definitely repurchase it became a part of my skin care routine
i will be buying more when the sample runs out
i will keep buying this
i impulse bought this product
the reviews sold me on this product
i will definitely buy again when i eventually run out
after doing a little bit of research i decided to splurge on it
i will be purchasing this again!
it was worth every penny
on my repurchase list at this price level.
it's a bit pricey however i'm more than happy to purchase this again with continued results
the price is a little steep
i will be repurchasing
the price is the only part i don't love about it
it is slightly cheaper
so worth the money.
i will be buying the full tub in the near future.
not sure i would purchase
i recently purchased purchased this.
will be repurchasing it when i run out
i plan to repurchase once i'm done.
i will continue to buy it
will continue to buy over
will buy over and over and over again.
it was worth it!!
this is my second time purchasing this product
i would completely recommend buying this product.
first time buying this
decided to buy this due to a recommendation to replace my moisturizer
will definitely buy this again.
the amount you get is not worth $40
maybe $25 is a more reasonable price for what amount of moisturizer you're actually getting
it was always sold out in stores
will definitely be repurchasing when i run out.
i will be purchasing it in the summer for sure
very pricey at the same time
well worth the money!
then switched to another product because of the price
hopefully if i repurchase it will be fine since i do love the actual contents
love this product and totally worth the purchase!
will purchase this product again for sure!
i wouldn't repurchase again because of the price
this is pricey for sure.
i wish the price point were a bit lower
i do wish the price point was a bit lower
this is what i'll buy going forward-
i definitely plan on buying it once this container is finished
even though it is expensive
i will probably re-purchase this until the day i die
although i suppose it's worth the investment
i don't regret buying it
i highly recommend this product it is so worth the money
a few other products i have purchased from sephora
which i will be purchasing this week
i decided to purchase this
even though the price point is higher
i definitely plan on buying this in the future when my jar is empty
after one try i decided it's worth every penny
i will be purchasing this cream as soon i run out
for that reason i may not purchase it after i finish the sample i received
the price is quite steep
would warn them of the price
i feel the price is not reasonable for continued use
the only negative thing i see is the price of the product
the price does seem high
my only complaint is the high price.
this product is well worth its price because it works wonders
the price is terrible
i do think this is really worth splurging for
most def going to purchase again and again!
this is one i would purchase again
it's worth the price truly.
i don’t know yet if i will repurchase after my bottle is done
my only concern is the price
may be worth the investment
i plan to purchase more when this bottle is empty
the price is the only factor that would stop me
my only concern is having to purchase it soon
this is worth the hefty price tag.
my one con is the price as it is very expensive for the individual bottle
i will repurchase as i am fully impressed with the results
this product is definitely a splurge
i probably would not purchase it again though because of the hefty price tag
it is still quite an investment
these patches are worth your buck!
this purchase is money well spent
this was definitely a splurge for me
it was worth it
these are so worth the price.
if you consider the price
one set is worth only $2.50!
considering the price point
if you consider buying sephora's in bulk vs
in terms of quantity for the price
this product has the most eyemasks per dollar of anything else offered at sephora
i decided to purchase these as an investment.
50 its a splurge at first
would definitely buy again!
look forward to purchasing it again
they do a good enough job to justify the price per pair i think
certainly worth the price
worth the price tag
you have 30 pairs for 75 dollars
price point is great for eye cream.
not for the price tag
i would definitely repurchase.
you can't beat the price
i can't believe it- i will buy this as long as it's on the shelf
i am giving it 4 stars because of the price.
will probably keep buying again
the price is nicer
its a bit pricy but its worth it.
some triple the price of this one
i will be repurchasing for sure
the afterfeel it gives alone is reason enough to buy it
however, the price is rather.
i would absolutely purchase if it were in the 20-25 price range
i wuld give this 4 out of 5 only because of the price
the price is great
how much this mask is priced at
i will continue to buy this
this mask is worth it
i would definitely buy this again.
would definitely buy again
for what it does, the price is average.
will be purchasing the full bottle despite the price because it's that good
maybe when i save some cash.
i think it might actually be worth buying
save your money and go straight to this solution.
i both bought a bottle
i am too poor to buy the full products right now
expensive but its worth the price
i would spend any amount of money for this product it is the only thing that works
it worth every penny
it's between $14-$17 dollars more than each
it's not good enough to warrant the price jump in my opinion
it depends on what you are using now whether this is a deal or a splurge
i just purchased this product for the 1st time
i will repurchase it again and again and.. again!
for me this product was a splurge
will repurchase this great product!
definitely worth the money.
definitely will re-purchase :)
t's definitely worth the money
will continue to repurchase clinque's take the day off
will purchase this again
this was a bit of an impulse buy
i would definitely buy again
worth it in my opinion!
worth the price imo.
i will be buying this again without a doubt.
will be buying the full version
this is my 3rd time repurchasing.
i will buy a full product now
i will be buying more once this is finished.
i'll wait until i finish the same size to determine if i'd buy this again
will definetly be buying this
so the sale price is nice
i came to buy one
i'll be buying a lot more
bought it because it was on sale
i am happy with this purchase!
it's actually a savings since i don't have to spend money on a separate daytime moisturizer
it is insanely over priced
probably wouldn't purchase again
just because of the $50 price
i will definitely be purchasing this when i run out of my current one
love it, will definitely buy again once i'm out.
i would 100% buy again.
i plan on purchasing when i run low of product because it is so hydrating
i plan on buy more once i run out
will be buying more
overall, not a fan especially for this price.
i would definitely purchase it once this runs out
i will definitely be back to buy this product!
i'd buy this product again, i recommend it.
i really love the stock in the cap as well
i originally bought this for the face
i will purchase this again when i run out!
the problem for me is the price is too high!
i won't buy it again.
great buy will definitely repurchase when i run out
it’s expensive but definitely worth the money.
so worth the price
the price tag is hefty
this highlighter is great and worth every penny.
turning 32, i find it worth it.
more expensive then id like to pay but worth it.
it makes no difference what it costs
i will purchase again.
at 1/3rd of the price
definitely worth the splurge since it has beneficial properties
this is reasonably priced
just recently bought this
definitely worth every penny!
this is definitely something i will purchase again
great price point and easy to travel with.
i rarely repurchase products
a must-buy for me (i'm in my early 30s).
i will be repurchasing this
feeling the container i felt like this could be worth the buy
t's definitely worth the money
definitely worth the price
after wasting money on products time
you will not regret this purchase!
will be buying this product in the tons.
i would buy again on sale
it really is worth the money
it's worth every cent
awesome for dry skin reasonable price
i've repurchased it like 6 times?
it is so worth the price tag.
the price is good
will definitely repurchase if i run out
while buying some high dollar ren oil
will definitely be purchasing this cream!
wish i could get more for the price
bought this to try instead
worth every single penny!!
only con is the hefty price tag.
its really worth the money
i will buy it again for sureee
it is priced well for what it is.
probably wouldn't repurchase until summer
the reason i gave 4 star is the price
i might repurchase in the future
i will purchase again.
will buy another when this one is almost gone.
the only downfall is the price
i believe the product is worth it
i would definitely buy again
that i had to buy it
even though it is expensive
it costs more than i wanted to pay
i cannot justify an $85 price tag for half an ounce of product
i love this product so much i will be purchasing
the splurge is so worth it
my only problem is the price.
i think if t was priced around 40$ it would be good
for now i'm not sure if i will repurchase
i i do i will only buy it on sale
this is pricey but i will definitely repurchase.
just repurchased a new bottle
worth the price tag!
so i thought i'd never purchase this again.
i love this and will repurchase it again.
i don't think i'll repurchase
so worth the 52 dollars
bought this as a splurge with the vib sale
i know this brand is pricey but well worth it.
definitely will be purchasing again
so although it is pricey
i already bought a back up its that good!
i will likely repurchase even if i have to pay full-price
these long-term results make this worth the splurge
buying my second bottle now.
won't be purchasing though.
it is definitely worth the price!
if you can buy this on sale
i will not be repurchasing
no selling in china
companies that sell in china are by law bound to test on animals
i will only be purchasing this on sale or w a discount
to me, that's worth the price tag!
it's a hefty price tag
the investment has been worth it for me
price is well worth the quality of this product!
which is why i keep repurchasing.
the price is great as well.
my only concern is the price however
i love it enough to repurchase
it's worth the price specially if you have dry
just purchased this yesterday
i will definitely purchase again.
definitely will be buying again when mine runs out
my only dislike is the price tag
i will continue to purchase this as long as origins makes it
definitely going to keep buying!
deff a product i'll be repurchasing!
love this mask, will repurchase.
not worth what i paid
well worth what it costs
i am super excited to be able to buy this online at sephora
i will repurchase for life
i certainly will consider purchasing it in the future
i'll be purchasing this one!
this is a fraction of the price
i will be re-purchasing it
the price is so affordable
there is no way i will not buy this
i will buy this over and over.
i will be buying the full product!
i think i may have to buy a big bottle
am getting ready to buy my second order
unless something else comes along to kick this ones booty i will be repurchasing
just wish it was cheaper.
will definitely be repurchasing!
it is definitely something i am considering purchasing
are worth the buy
i definitely am buying more when i run out!!
it is a pricey product
would love to buy it
'm undecided on if i will purchase it or not
i try to pinch pennies for most things
worth the price, and i don't say that lightly!
it's pricey but worth every penny.
don't care about the price, this is a must.
$98 is quite a lot to invest into a makeup product
i know the price tag is pretty hefty
it is totally worth it
i wish they sold a smaller less expensive version
i will not purchase a serum for that price
just had to go buy a bottle
the price is steep but the quality is spot on.
i will def be buying the big size .
for the same price
so that helps with the price
will definitely purchase this again.
this is seriously the only one that i want to repurchase again
i highly recommend and will purchase again.
this is 100% worth the splurge!!
pricy but worth every drop!
absolutely worth the splurge
forth on whether or not to make the purchase
decent amount of product for the money
which is great at this price
not many products can actually be worth its price
the next time i am able to splurge this will be the 1st on the list
i will buy this again.
don't love the price
will stock up during the vibrouge sales!
read all that i could about this product before purchasing
i may have to stock up on this because it's so precious
at least try the sample size with the current promo code before it's out of stock
i repeatedly purchased it.
the only reason why i didn't rate 5 stars is because of the price
i'll probs repurchase whenever i run out
i will forever purchase this!
i will most likely buy this
price are good too
it's actually the first product i ever bought that goes above
i will keep buying
bought this for my husb
i love the value of this set.
this is the second time i've purchased this since purchasing the sample for 100 points
if you buy this kit
this is the 3rd time i have purchased pepstart eye cream
overall a great set for the price.
this combo pack is a good deal
you can't beat the value for this set.
but consider the value this is okay
this set is such a great deal that i plan on buying a new one before they sell out
will def be buying this again
yes, it is pricey but it is well worth it.
totally worth the money
this stuff is worth every dime!
very worth that money is money well spent
the price is a bit high
however won't be buying this again as other cheaper moisturizers give the same results for much less
i will repurchase this product as long as they make it
expensive but worth it :)
can see more of the long term results without splurging on the first purchase
now i plan on buying more sunday riley products
i balked at the price initially
it is definitely worth the investment
i decided to purchase this product
along with the fancy price tag came a lot of high expectations
i will be repurchasing this for sure!
this is one product i will be hoarding like a doomsday prepper
months so the price tag is so so worth it
i hoard this product now like a doomsday prepper.
i would buy it again though.
i will forever repurchase.
think the price per use is fantastic
not enough to justify the price
i hate the price point
it was my first purchase
i would 100% repurchase this
trust me, it’s worth it.
the price is a little high
i would have given it 5 stars if it wasn't for the price
so amazing that i am actually contemplating paying the ridiculous price they are selling the full size product for lol
i will definitely repurchase!
feel that the price tag is a little steep
i definitely would love to purchase it
i just bought this yesterday
i will buy more
i can assure you the price is 100% worth it
i will be a forever customer.
want to buy the big container
i intend to keep purchasing this product
this product is worth the investment
for those worried about the higher price tag
we are ready to purchase a full bottle
definitely will repurchase in the future
the costs is worth the results.
i highly recommend and will be buying again.
next paycheck i'm buying this
would repurchase it again!
will definitely be repurchasing!
this isn't something i would have bought
i definitely will recommend and continue to buy!
definitely will purchase in the future!
plus, the price is absolutely amazing!
ended up buying it
will buy again when i'm done because you get a pretty good amount for the price
def will be repurchasing once my sample runs dry!
i would buy this for sure.
price it just is not worth it
amount its an amazing deal
definitely going to purchase when i run out!
will definitely buy again.
i will definitely be buying this again.
i love it and will be purchasing it again.
it is a pricey product
will not be repurchasing this serum because i need something that's age defying
totally in love and will buy again and again
i am sold on this for life
try it, it is well worth the cost!
i may even think about repurchasing the eye cream
get two bottles for the price of one.
do i like the price tag?
it was worth a try
at this price it should.
had to buy it from saks
i will buy this product again.
buy this in the first place
overall though, i'm not sold on this.
i doubt that i'll repurchase it.
i'll be buying this product again!
well worth the price
this was worth every penny.
never considered buying anything as it is a pricey br
prices were slightly lower
the only problem i have is the steep price
price point is a little steep i'll admit.
will purchase more to continue the treatment
you will likely only need to purchase 1-2x per year
couldn't really justify the hefty price tag
first off, i can't believe the price of this.
i will buy it again
certainly goes a long way so this product is the worth the investment as it will last a while
at least that i can recall currently
i will say this is probably overpriced
it was really painful for me to buy this oil because of the price
it was on my list for vib sale to knock a
i held out for the vib sale
totally worth the investment
i wish price was a bit lower
i would give 5 stars but 4 because of the price.
i am not sure why this product has to cost $150
i will most likely fork over the $150 to buy it once my sample runs out
even though it comes with a heftier price tag
it is well worth the investment
the price is a little steep
it may be worth it
was available for purchase here in the us
feel like it is worth the expense
it is totally worth it
it is a bit pricy but i find it is worth it.
the price tag is high
although the price is higher
by letting me try this product they now have a lifetime buyer
i believe that it's worth every penny
if you can afford the price it is a good product.
the only downside of this product is it's price
i will start out by saying the cost would prohibit me from purchasing this product
i will def buy after my bottle is gone.
purchase it myself once i run out of my current bottle
i can see repurchasing especially during the drier seasons
the price my seem high
well worth the price of the bottle
i would purchase this oil again without hesitation
i will be buying more
if i ever use the whole bottle i will be buying more
'll probably splurge when my bottle is empty
i wouldn't mind paying full price
haven't even begun to make a debt
it is worth the money
will be buying the full product.
definitely worth the price!
i look foward to purchasing again in the futures
it seems to me like a generous jar for the price
is the only thing i'm willing to splurge on
it's totally worth the price
love it so much that i'm planning on buying the other products in this line
why this is so expensive --
so far i'm happy with my purchase.

love it and will continue purchasing.
the price is wonderful for the amount you get
the serum is a good amount for the price
very affordable price with great performance.
i will probably purchase this again.
for the price you pay
i don't think i will be purchasing this
totally worth the splurge
i will continue to purchase this as my go-to weekly mask
the splurge is worth every penny.
however it is so expensive!!
this is worth the cost if it works for you.
the results are worth it
not the entire purchase
i gave it 4 stars because it is quite a small amount for the price tag
the hefty price tag has been holding me back
it's sold out online
the price is a bit steep
was super stingy on the price
it is worth every penny
this mask is seriously worth the money.
i will repurchase again, and again, and again.
the price is a lot
needless to say i was immediately sold
will definitely buy again.
worth splurging to see if it gets along with your regimen
overall price is hefty
contemplated buying because of the price
i would rebuy this again and again.
i never wanted to use perricone because of the price
i like that its under $100 for it too $90 is a good price for a serum
never purchased cause of the price

i do not regret this purchase.
i am definitely buying this again
the product is worth every cent of it
i highly recommend buying this gem!

in my opinion worth it
so i am going back to purchase this cream.
definitely worth buying the full jar.
will definitely buy again!
it is worth a try
i will not be purchasing it again since it is quite expensive
this product is one of the very few i have repurchased over the years
even though the price point is high
it pays off to do research!
the only thing i dislike about this product is the price
it is totally worth it
although it is a bit pricier
i only wish that it brought more product for the price it is
ended up going with this mainly because the price was $5 cheaper
just for that, i find it to be worth the price.
i would recommend it an repurchase!
i wish the price point was a little lower
5 for the product but 3 for the price.
now it's my second time purchasing
this is the only one i've repurchased
can justify the price
i just think at $75 bucks it may not be worth it.
definitely worth the buy!
am slowly purchasing everything
will be repurchasing as soon as mine runs out
the price is still a bit steep
the price is too much
buy it now because i have so many skincare products already
try it before buying!
i would definitely recommend and repurchase.
i would def repurchase!
as for the price
curios to see any changes or if i'll repurchase as it is quite pricy as well as see how long it lasts me
repurchased because i love it
100% worth the price and amazing.
i just purchased this with the babyfacial

makes me glow for the $82cad price point i doubt i'd purchase this
if it ever goes on sale
very happy with this purchase!
definitely will be purchasing again !
$68 is a pretty big price tag for the amount of product you do get
i don't know if the price is worth it
the price is a bit high for me
if you decide to purchase one product from tatcha as an intro into luxury
the price is a lot
i know this has a high price point
it is totally worth it
the price is a little high
definitely worth the buy!
however for the price per product it is not good value
i wiish they would make a bigger stick for a more reasonable price
i think it's worth the price
3rd purchase of this stick
at first i was hesitant to buy this.
i plan on repurchase when i run out.
i got it when it was on sale
i can't wait to buy more when they go on sale again

purchased it right away
i would buy as a gift for special friends.
i would definitely consider repurchasing if it was in the $16-20 range
i will definetly be repurchasing a second one
box as well and have already re-purchased.
this is a really good product that i may purchase
totally worth the money!
will continue to buy for sure!
i will be buying the full bottle when i run out of my clinique
will definitely be repurchasing!
i will definitely buy again!
you won't be afraid to look to repurchase
i purposely bought it for the weather
however the price is great.
i will definitely purchase again.
this is my third time purchasing this product
the price has gone up
it is still affordable
they didn't have the product in stock
this product is worth it!
i've repurchased this twice now
worth every penny, i won't ever be without it.
i will definitely repurchase
i will definitely purchase this again.
t's well worth the price
probably will continue to purchase it
i will purchase again.
i found it was by far the best price
it this were a few bucks cheaper
girls this is a must buy
i would definitely buy again.
i wish it was still available at the store
worth the wait for shipping
the shipping is well worth it
found this for a deep discount at another store so wanted to give it a try
investing 70 bucks in this product has saved me tons of money-not spending it on primers or moisturizers or highlighters or luminizers
i will be saving up for this 70$ gift from heaven
not bad at all for the price!
i will repurchase continually!
i've bought the biggest bottle
the only cleanser i've ever repurchased.
it's worth the price
great product though, i will buy again!
these products are pricey but well worth it!
i will buy it for the third time now bc it's one of my biggest necessities
i will buy it again once i finish the bottle
the value is great
absolutely worth the money
i will be buying the good genes
will be purchasing more in the future
i hate the high price tag of this item
recently bought another bottle
i will definitely be repurchasing
i will more than likely be repurchasing it in the future
its worth the money over spending $600 a month at the dermatologist
i think it is worth it
you won't regret this purchase.
a little go a long way so the price will be worth it
i find it is worth it
it's worth every penny
i deal with it because it works
t's worth the hefty price tag
it's definitely worth the price
i am sure that it will exceed your expectations
i can't put a price on the confidence i have now
t's definitely worth the money
i'll be buying the bigger one next time
i would repurchase if it could be made in a smoother formula
this will be my next splurge item.
i gave it a 4 because of the price point.
i just ran out and plan to repurchase.
the only downside is that i would not pay the amount it cost for this
if there was a sale or a good coupon
probably not worth the $80
the results make it completely worth it
otherwise just splurge once in a while
purchased it for the second time.
i used this mask once and was sold !
i might buy it if i have some extra cash on the side
i will be purchasing this for sure!
it's not in my budget to pay full price for this
as soon as i have the extra money i will be repurchasing right away
it was a little out of my normal price range
this is worth the money if you use a thin amount
unfortunately the $80 cdn price tag is a little much to have in my skin routine
sure the price tag is a bit up there
i will definitely repurchase based on it showing immediate results
it's definitely going on my list for future purchases
it's so worth the money
if it weren't so expensive i might actually buy it
i wish they had a travel size for sale tho
i can see the results something definitely worth to buy
i will definitely re purchased this if i am feeling rich though
the price tag is a little steep for what it is
this is worth a try
this mask is definitely worth investing in.
i would like to have the option of buying the cream only
for that reason i may not repurchase the product
read a lot of reviews before i buy
didn't see cream sold separately yet.
will definitely be repurchasing again.
it is definitely worth the money
so this product has me sold.
i will continue to purchase!
will be buying a bottle
this is worth ever penny
that is a lot of pennies
you get more for a better price
the price is a little steep
i'll be repurchasing when i run out.
i would have said that this mask is worth the money
i'll have to buy it next time i'm in store
absolutely worth the price

especially to justify the price
i will buy again.

will be looking online for cheaper option
spending a lot of money on one
totally worth the buy!
do not want to spend 38 more dollars when i can buy a chanel mascara for 32
definitively worth the price!
the only downside is the price
even though it is a splurge product
i've lost count how many times i've repurchased this product
will be purchasing when i get my paycheck
i will repurchase forever!
the price is on point.
which is great since buying a bottle isn't cheap
worth the money, i would consider it a steal.
the price makes me think :
great product and worth every penny!
almost bought this based on the scent alone.
the price per ounce isn't too bad.
i will repurchase this
it is worth the price.
great product and will repurchase it again.
especially for the price
i am definitely going to buy more from this line
ill be repurchasing over and over again.

just buy it anyway
i'll keep using my samples before i decide whether to buy this product
will be purchasing this
worth every penny in my opinion.
i will continue buying this mask for the cooling

it's definitely worth the price for the box of 4 masks
over all i will purchase again.
i think this was a good investment.

i couldn't be happier with this purchase.
the price is high
my only recommendation is to go to the actual site as you can buy the combo for half the price
price is reasonable especially considering the results
will be purchasing this when next buying moisturizer
i will be repurchasing this for the summer when my skin is not so dry
it wasn't payday yet
despite the price tag
i would never go purchase an "anti aging" product
i will be buying this!
the only reason for the 4 stars is the price
however i don't like the price
i 100% recommend even with the high price tag
you are going to spend a few more dollars
so after i sold my first child i was able to afford it
never found something that i would like to repurchase
i've tried so many things from a range of prices
it absorbs quickly, i will definetly repurchase.
the price as well

$32 is def worth it because i have what could be over a year's supply
i would buy this product over and over.
for the amount of product the price is a little much imo
i can't believe that i have found this after 6 years of trying every product from dirt cheap to luxe prices
just bought the confidence in a cream
this one will be purchased again
worth it for sure!
i buy three jars at a time.

i thinks it's worth buying it
at this point i will never consider spending money on another eye cream

if you are considering buying this product for the first time
overall i'm happy with this purchase.

works well enough that i would purchase again
the only con is you have to use a fair amount

this is well worth the price because you won't need to buy a separate eye make-up remover
i'll definitely think of purchasing this product!
i would not purchase this
seems like it's not the best value for the price
i would repurchase this product

was a little hesitant about buying this because it is expensive
i do think this product is a little over priced
i will probably be buying it when i run out
i will continue spending the extra money on this.
definitely worth the cost
purchasing a bottle of my own
i feel like with the high price point
debating whether to purchase again
for the price, i guess i just expected more.
i will not be repurchasing.
it is truly worth every penny.
absolutely, positively worth the splurge!
recommend it is worth the money:
the only problem is the the price.
well worth the price

what a great purchase on my part!

i believe i will use less of this per use than i do of any similarly priced package of 30 wipes
not only is the price point nice
i waste sure of this product because of its price
100% recommend and it's such an affordable price.
i would continue to buy this.
i look forward to purchasing this
i just recently bought this product
figured for the price point it was worth a shot
i'll definitely be buying these again.
the price can't be beat!
great product & great price!
i plan on repurchasing
can't beat the price either
why did sephora change the price?
this product is one of my favorite small buys!
will most definitely repurchase again many times!
is at a great price tag
worth it all the way.
i originally bought this only to get free shipping
bought the rose one which is supposed to be brightening
really great buy for $5 on sale.
even $10 is still worth it!
for the price it's worth it
it was so worth it
decided to try it cause of the lower price
i wish it was a bit bigger for the price since it is a sephora br
the rose is sold out often
i've purchased higher priced exfoliators which have never worked for me
excellent value for the price.
it is much more affordable
i just wish you could buy a bigger amount
i just wished it was sold in a bigger bottle!
i don't know if the price is worth it
making the price too much
this is ridiculously priced
not worth the price
it will be absolutely worth the price in a few years from now
immediately had to purchase the real thing
as it is a pretty penny
absolutely worth it in the long run
i didn't want to love this product because of the steep price tag
worth every penny for mature skin.
the price would be a stop sign for my future purchase
i've tried everything on the market
price is reasonable too!
i will definitely repurchase this when the bottle runs out
great stuff, will recommend and repurchase!
i am go to purchase this !
bought this mask instead
i will certainly be purchasing this.
especially at a $38 price point
i will definitely have to buy the full bottle next time i'm at sephora
this was the best purchase ever.
had purchased the evercalm mask
and the price is unbeatable!!!!!
it's a reasonable price which is good for my wallet
worth the occasional splurge
deducted one star for the price
i gave it 4 stars only because the price is a little high $$$
i know that this product is pricey
at first i was hesitant bc the price is higher than i wanted to spend
but it 100% worth it.
bought this little gem
def worth every penny!
will purchase over and over.
will be repurchasing again soon
definitely will purchase again.
it's probably not worth the price tag overall
about to purchase my third time!!
this product is slightly overpriced
worth it for now
the price is well worth it
a wonderful product that needs a price check
will definitely re purchase.
the price is incredibly reasonable considering the small amount you need to apply
going to be buying this soon!
was interested in purchasing
they were out of stock both online
used before i would definitely buy this
i honestly dont think its worth the price tag
i justify spending this much money on it because the smallest amount goes a long way
i personally wouldn't buy this
i plan on splurging on it in the near future
it's good but not worth the price
wish this was sold in a tube or squeeze bottle
the initial cost is slightly up there
get a spare jar just in case it is out of stock when i need to reorder
definitely worth your dollar (:
am seriously considering splurging for a jar
am delighted the price point is under $60
i do think it's worth the purchase of a full product
the price is hefty
this is a best seller at sephora for a reason
stock up during sales!
the biggest problem is the price tag.
will be purchasing this in the future
i plan on buying a case if they ever discontinue this product
i am glad it is now in stock
i only say "unfortunately" because the price is a bit higher then i'd like to pay for a moisturizer
i will be purchasing this product as soon as it is back in stock
i do think it should be priced cheaper than a typical foundation though
i really wasn't expecting much from this it was an impulse buy
it was totally worth the money
i gave this 4 stars only because of the price
will def re-purchase both.
hoping this lasts awhile for the price/amount.
i buy a lot from sephora
out of everything i buy
the price is more than worth it
only removed a star because for the price
definitely rebuying this product again.
well worth the money.
the price is steep
it is not $40 dollar good.2.
lowered the price by half i would buy it
i will definitely keep buying this.
decided to purchase it from its already great reviews
so i decided to purchase this product.
i will definitely be purchasing this mask
am delighted it does not cost a million bucks

i will definitely be buying it again!
you will not regret buying this...
the price is a bit steep for me.
so worth the purchase!
excellent product and worth the money for me.
i can deal with it
honestly think the price tag is worth it considering my small sample has lasted me for about 2 months
honestly worth every penny
it's worth every penny
i can not wait to purchase this.
certain products are worth the splurge
i think that this product is worth the price
likely will repurchase it when i run out
:( that might deter me from purchasing.
this will be a forever purchase of mine.
once i finish this jar i'm definitely going to be repurchasing
i plan on repurchasing.
1st time purchasing it

not sure if i will repurchase due to price
this was definitely worth every penny.
now i have to buy it tomorrow
give 4 stars due to price.
definitely would recommend and buy again.
will purchase again for sure!
i repurchased halfway though my first bottle because i was worried it might sell out
believe me when i've been forking over the same price for other less effective face oils
it's important to me to feel like something is worth buying for the price
the price point is quite fair for what you get
i don't usually write reviews on my purchases.
i will definitely buy it again.
then this maran argan reserve is sure worth a try
this oil reserve is totally worth the $$$i personally enjoy the scent
i promise this will not be a purchase you will regret
i gave 4 stars because the price is a bit steep.
i think jm customers will buy it even if it had normal packaging
this stuff is gold and totally worth the money!!
but splurged on this with a gift card last week.
this is definitely a product i want to keep purchasing
i will enjoy my one purchase
this is a luxury item.
the price is steep for ½ ounce of the reserve
you would need to purchase a couple of bottles to last you
in order to have a more affordable price.
it is worth the money!
very expensive for the amount
will definitely buy it again
although it is definitely on the pricier side
i strongly recommend splurging on it
i will repurchase again.
this product is totally worth the extra $
i will definitely be repurchasing this product in the future
this is another one i will continue to repurchase
i will definitely be purchasing again.
the price tag is a bit steep
the results are worth it
so still saving money in the end
i will definitely be repurchasing!
minus the price tag
definitely will be repurchasing!
it is totally worth the price.
purchased this for me
i love this product and will be repurchasing.
cons: price is a bit too high

i will definitely repurchase.
the results are worth it

it is worth every single penny
i will continue to use this product since it is worth every penny
look forward to buying again
at least i can buy it in person
it's not worth the money
it's worth every single penny
i guess because i had paid quite a tidy sum for it
i figured once in my life during the sale
i am definitely planning on repurchasing once i run out
i balked at using this for a long time due to the price
which makes the price easier to swallow
balked at purchasing this for years due to the cost
i would definitely buy again.
thought about returning it because of the high price tag
i will definitely be repurchasing
i stocked up during vib 15% off sale.
so the vib sales are an amazing time to pick it up
it is so expensive
this is a splurge but i'm worth it.
save a little bit each paycheck after the bills are paid
the price put me off
because now i have to buy this $300 cream
will have to save up to buy this.
'll be purchasing very soon
it is truly worth every penny.
f you average the price
only downfall is the price
i'll buy anything low end
i know this is expensive
so to me, this is definitely worth the price tag.
stopped buying it because it is not sold in my local department stores after we moved
pricey but worth it.
i will definitely repurchase
i will definitely be repurchasing.
deducting 1 star for cost
so happy sephora is starting to stock this br

price point is really good!
i'll definitely be buying a new bottle when mine finishes
the price compared to the amount of product is sad
will definitely repurchase once i finished up my tube
however i will not be repurchasing it as i find the effect to be very minimal
this one is truly worth the price.
is so dam expensive that i am waiting for the vib sale to get it
the price seems high at first
i plan to purchase this
already ordered a backup in the vib sale
i definitely splurged to purchase this product
would definitely continue to buy

the price is so affordable i figured i'd give it a try

t was defensively worth the buy
this is absolutely the best eye product i have ever bought
it is worth every penny
my eyes have paid the price

its well worth every penny.
i originally purchased this for my facial
amazing and worth the price.
it is relatively cheap and worth trying.
great product and will purchase again.
this is the cheapest "pure" oil by ounce sold at sephora
it is 100% worth the cost
so for the price i think you're getting a quality product
at such a great price
for the size/price this eye cream is a no brainer
i will be repurchasing
definitely worth the money!!
i've bought this twice now and will continue to.
i will repurchase this product over
i love the price point
this almost 20% discount is fabulous
purchasing right after i hit send on this review
the price is also a lot steeper than i'd prefer.
i know the price is steep
this one is worth trying
i typically buy mid-price eye cream
making them so worth the investment for your face
t's worth the price if this makes me look refreshed
i will definitely be purchasing
i will forever be buying this product.
although for this price point
i don't think i will repurchase when my jar is gone
the price is up there a little
i can not say fully that this one is fully worth the large price tag
this eye cream is worth every penny.
i wouldn't have tried it if it wasn't included in the points buy items lineup
definitely will be purchasing in the future
i am for sure going to purchase again!
i will definitely be purchasing this product after i run out
the price may seem a little high
the price point of this product warrants a sturdier box
would consider purchasing in the future
the price point of this product is quite high
at this price point i'd stick with something cheaper
the only down side is the price
$135 is a steep price for me to pay for a facial cream
otherwise i may not have bought it due to the price point
if you can splurge on a luxury beauty product this would be the way to go
i gave it 4 stars just because of the price.
will likely purchase it when this one runs out
i'll definitely be buying this one regularly.

i will be repurchasing for sure!!
it gets expensive to buy this so often.

will definitely buy again!
i am definitely purchasing this product.

this will be a repeat purchase for me.
just buy this product
i finally decided to buy it
i already need to repurchase
i wasn't about to spend that much
now i know it isn't sold for acne
its worth the price if it does this for you
bought it during the most recent vib sale
i will buy this forever and ever
and i saw it at the store and decided to buy it.
it's definitely worth the money i will continue to buy once i'm low
it is so worth the money
i will definitely buy it again!!
will for sure buy it again
was well worth the price
because of the ridiculous price point- no primer should cost that much- i only wear it on weekends
i deducted one star for the cost.
i will buy another bottle once i'm finished.
i will definitely purchase this again!
it lost a star because i'm not 100% sure it's worth the price it's more like an extra step of luxury than a necessity
will continue to repurchase for sure!
will continue on buying it
this is also the cheapest price i've found it at.
will continue to purchase this product
that's worth the price to me
will be purchasing again
definitely going back to buy it

i will rationalize my future purchase of this stuff eventually

you don't have to buy a pump with it
the price is okay.

they should lower the price though or make a smaller size because i can't afford it
i will be repurchasing this again soon
i almost bought a shiseido product
this one is amazing for its price point
i take one pump of this
this certainly is expensive
this is worth the price to me so far
especially with the 20% off during the vib sale
even though i re purchased cause its a great product
a little pricier than what i was using
the price is exorbitant
now im going to have to continue buying this bc its just that good
for the price point it would be nice to get an ounce of product instead of 0
the price tag is steep
just now had to repurchase
so needless to say i'll be repurchasing.
the price may seem steep
this is a splurge worthy of repurchase.
i did purchase in store even though website says online only
will be purchasing again.
i will definetly be buying this again.
i will repurchase when i run out
overall, it is good and worth the price.
probably won't repurchase because of the packaging
the price point isnt bad either
that is a huge selling point
don't think i'll be repurchasing
this cleanser is worth the value because it is a huge tube- i will most likely repurchase
the price is a little steep
like the product - expensive for what it is.

i guess they wanted to make multi-masking a selling point

so the value is the same
instead i just have to get this mask duo which retails for less than what buying two masks of about the same size would be
glamglow is known for its prices so honestly that wasn't a shock
i saw this little collectible edition while in line for the cash at sephora
would definitely buy again!
fine product, but probably won't repurchase.
a great deal considering some single use masks cost half of this price or more
this is the first glamglow product that i think is worth the money
i plan on buying many more before it is out of stock
for everyone complaining about the amount of product vs the price
i would buy this product again
i will be saving up to purchase another glam glow mask in the future

it has been the best thing i've bought at sephora
ole henriksen has fantastic products for their price
overall, i would buy the product again
i can only give it 4 stars because it is prohibitively expensive
i'd buy that in a heartbeat!
i could never justify the price
although i just spent a mini fortune on sunday riley's line i am going to purchase the expensive serum to continue with this routine
i buy every mask
could probably stock my own sephora store
i always feel like i'm putting a million dollars on my face
on here to purchase more

my only objection is the price
i'd totally buy it again
it's expensive, but it is worth every penny.

decided to give it a try in spite of the price
it worth every penny.
i still balk at the price every time i see it in stores
definitely worth the money
before buying this cream i was very skeptical about it
s of dollars worth of products
i think i'll buy next time
although it is very expensive
i wouldn't normally buy a face cream that costs over $130
it only takes a small amount so really in the end it's worth the price
because its cheaper per ounce
all things considered, the price is worth it!
truly worth every cent.
love your skin buy this product.
plan to buy more when the time comes
i would purchase this product again despite its insane price because a little does go a long way

it is a little pricey, but for me it is worth it.
for this reason alone i will keep purchasing it.
i got it in a value pack.
despite the high price
i've purchased many products to help with my breakout
the sales associate gave me two options
buying another bottle of this soon!
i would repurchase it
a bit expensive, but worth it.

in the end it was hard to justify the price tag
i usually never review the products i buy
even though the price point is a bit high these two products are worth every penny
this product does a great job and is priced well.

it is expensive though
the price point is great

the price and the product is matching.
i will definitely buy this again
i don't think i would purchase this due to the price

i will also be repurchasing

i would gladly purchase
i will definitely be buying this product when i run out

i will purchase another myself when i run out
why the price increase?

i repurchased this item so can say its good.
i will definitely purchase this product again
is worth every penny
i've purchased this for a year
i will be buying more when it runs out.
this is the second time i have purchased this cream i like the smell
then purchased it separately after using it all
when i first purchased this i didn’t expect much
the price is high
this is one of the best on the market in terms of value
only problem is the amount you get for the price you pay
i wish it was a bigger container for the price.
it is priced middle of the road
it is very expensive, but it is worth it.
i've purchased this at least 10 times.
i can deal with it
i am buying this product for the second time now.
i will buy it again.
try this product, it's worth every penny!
i will definitelybuy this product again.
would i repurchase again?
it loses a star for the price.
reluctantly pay full price for it
will continue to purchase over and over.
on the pricey side but its worth it.
my only complaint is the price
i love it and will continue buying!
i will purchase this product again and again.
absolutely worth the buy
well worth the money
i immediately knew i would purchase it.
it costs a bit more than i would normally spend on cleanser
balked at buying it even though i loved the deluxe sample i received
haven't regretted the purchase
it is reasonably priced at $28 for 5 oz.
i do not think i will repurchase however i woukd recommend
will definitely be repurchasing
and its totally worth the price.
i will continue to repurchase this over
have now bought 2 bottles
the price is quite reasonable
the price is reasonable for the high quality
i will definitely buy this again once my bottle is empty
but the product inside is worth it.
this will be my next big beauty purchase
this is the first cleanser in more than 10 years that i've repurchased
i feel it's a great value--i would pay more than $28 for it
the only complaint i have is the price
i would repurchase it again anyway
i will definitely be purchasing the full version!
i am going to purchase this now!
buy another it works so well for me
i will certainly be purchasing a bottle once my sample runs out
i highly recommend that you purchase this!
now there are a million choices.
pricey but worth it.
i will not repurchase due to the high price tag
so this is not something i'll buy again
second time buying this product
well worth the price :
i will be buying again
i'll be buying this again.
love it and will definitely be buying again.
i'll probably be purchasing a 3rd tube soon
is worth it if it works for you
my only concern is the price for the amount of product
after a few uses i'm sold
had to buy him one
the price is unbeatable
we swear buy this product.
i will be re-buying it
the only reason why i'm giving it a 4 star is because the expiration date is relatively short
usually 12 to 18 months at best when i buy the product
happy with it and will probably purchase again.
i always buy two or three of them when they come on sale
of course they are out of stock
this is the only eye product i have bought twice
i finally found an eye cream that i am willing to repurchase
the price for the results are perfect
when i went to repurchase recently at my local store it was not in stock
i wish this product were priced lower.
will i buy this product specifically?
will repurchase this product again.
good product except for price
i did initially feel like the price was high
mid-range price, will definitely buy again.
great price for a product that lasts a long time even when using am
will purchase again for what it's done for me already
the only downside is the price

this is a little pricey but worth the money.
it was pricey to keep up
they are reasonably priced
cost is worth if for how little you need each application
the price is really good

how the sale works
i will probably purchase this for the longest time
will definitely purchase again if i ever run out of this bottle
if this ever runs out i will be booking it to sephora to stock up again
i do always buy the mini versions at the checkout
$11 for 3 ounces, completely worth that price.
cleaned it perfectly fine' the price is great considering the amount of the product
not a repeat purchase for me
5/5 will continue to buy this cleanser it's my go to

the only reason the product isn't five stars is because of the price
i know this product is expensive
it is totally worth the money

i wish it was less expensive
i still purchase it despite the cost because it's worth the results
the only reason i take off 1 star is because of the price
i don't believe the product would be worth the money
even with its hefty price tag
then had to buy a whole container
i did a double take on the price
this stuff is definitely worth the extra money spent
it is expensive, but it's worth the money.
not as pricey as another round of ipl would be

the benefits are worth every penny
it is much more expensive
the price is high
i took one look at the price
the price was high
don't think this is worth the premium attached to it
not positive this is worth the money yet
it's well wortth the 85.00 price tag!

the price is shocking!
only downside is high pricetag-- i wish it was more affordable
i should add that i also purchased the clairsonic mia at the same time

then repurchase this for the warmer months
it is really an excellent product of clinique that i keep repurchasing so far

i wasn't wowed enough to justify spending that amount

for the pricing i'm surprised.
i did a lot of research before buying
the sephora employee had assured me that almost everyone who purchases it buys it again
making this a much better value than you'd think just based on price alone
i decided to invest in a new routine
you also get a pretty large bottle for the price which made it worth the money
i've tried probably hundreds of dollars worth of products to try
it's pricier than most but worth every penny.
i just purchased my second
the price is a bit steep for the product i think.
totally worth it and i would buy it again!

admit it was a great purchase

seriously wonderful and worth the money spent!
the reason i gave it 4 stars is because of price
i only wish the price is lower
the only complaints i have are the price
it has the potential to be worth the price.

how much it costs
it is still something to think about before buying

it was totally worth it.
this product is a must buy!
the price is not so good
i think this is the one skin product i keep repurchasing
i will be buying from murad.

much better than anything you would buy at the supermarket
not a fan of the price
this product is worth it
the price is a little high though.
from high end to low price
double the price is a little pushing it
i would absolutely repurchase this cream.
you pay the price for them but they work.
also worth it considering i'm not going to pay 3 digits for a night cream
time for me to repurchase!!!
it's rare that i take the time to write a review on a product purchased unless it really works
all of my purchases on sephora
it was worth it
despite the cost it is well worth it!
stop reading and go buy this right now!
worth the money for what you get!
this is by far the best product i've ever purchased in a while
well worth the price.
i do agree the price is a little steep for such little product
unfortunately it's just too expensive for me to re-purchase every 5 weeks
it's worth every penny!!
i've purchased this product 3 times
the downside to the caudalie is that for me
the value for cost
definitely worth the investment on my dry
i think it's worth the price tag
it is worth the money!

i will continue to repurchase.
if sephora still sells the unwrinkle kit
it was well worth it to discover this product
i will probably repurchase since it actually works
definitely going back for a refund.
may need to buy directly from ptr in the future.
it works and it is worth the cost!

very happy and well worth the price.
pricey but worth it.
about half the price
the only other moisiturizer i have found that comes close to this is la mer at 3 times the price
am back to buy more
the price seems like a good buy since many other creams are much more expensive at least outside of the drugstore
because i will happily continue to buy it
this product is well worth the money
i agree that it is pricey
for me it is worth every penny
not buy it again
i do believe it is overpriced
stock up during any
i went immediately to sephora to purchase
i would buy this again
i will be buying more when this jar runs out
kidda pricey but certainly worth it's price.
this is so expensive
the price is not light on the wallet
ladies it is well worth the splurge
i wll make my decision ir i will buy another jar when i have finished this one

t may be worth the steep price
i will purchase this again.
i gawk at the price
i am tempted to buy
i need to buy another one
i will have to budget my money better from now on
however for the price i suppose i expected more
though expensive, it worth to spend.
i probably will buy again.
this is the second time i am purchasing this product
yes, it is pricey but well worth the price.
this is a product that will always be in stock at my house
have to shell out the simoleans to buy it
i finally decided to buy it
if it wasn't out of my price range
it was totally worth my $100 dollars!
this mask is worth the price tag!
this is one of the pricey products
you cant bet i am using my coupon to purchase this
it would cost about the same amount
if you are on the fence price point
although totally worth the price
i wish it was cheaper i would buy it
however i won't buy the full size because unfortunately the company is not cruelty free
it would be great to be able to buy this incredible mask in a 1 oz
worth a try if you have the money to spend
the price is a bit high
the only reason this would get 4 stars instead of 5 is the price
i will be purchasing once i'm out
i do struggle with the price
it is so worth it
now i need to buy it!
i would definitely recommend spending the money for greater skin
i think will worth every cent
for the price it is i expect it to do more
i just won't pay that much for it
i think i will continue to purchase
worth its price tag to me
i will definitely have to purchase it soon though
only downside is the price.
only thing keeping me from repurchasing.
the only thing stopping me is the price
rating this 4 stars because i'm not loving the price
not anymore after seeing the heavy price tag
i would definitely buy it if the price was decent
$108 before tax is too steep
just too pricey to repurchase
i saw the price
would honestly never purchase at the current price point though
keep fresh in mind for future purchases
not worth the price at all.
good one and good price
won't be buying it
i go to buy it
however i feel the price is a bit much
that time period is not at all worth the price tag to me
it is worth all the pennies.
then i saw the price tag
this product is worth it
pay my own rent
put a down payment on a new car then i'll be a regular purchaser of this mask
i just saw the price!!
i would've given this 5 stars if not for the very high price tag
i cannot justify spending this much
at this price point
the price is the only thing that's making me think twice about purchasing
it is worth the price.
i will be purchasing again!
only complaint would be the price
the best part for me is that i didn't pay the full price
i paid $79 for this
when i'm done with this i'll be more than happy to pay full price
it's worth the buy
for the price i can't keep it up when i run out
it is pricy, but well worth the money.
the only bad thing is the price
they raised the price from $82
i guess its worth it though
not sure if i will repurchase yet
waiting for the nov sale to repurchase.
which is why the price is just not justifiable for me
i felt like the full priced version was expensive
i will definitely purchase again!
like it and feel good will buy it again
great results, great price.
definitely will be repurchasing it.
i will be purchasing this over

it looks expensive at first
this is worth the price
t is definitely a value
this is my second time purchasing this item

i cannot justify repurchasing for that reason alone
sensitive skin like i do it's worth the price
expensive but worth it!
for the price there should be more product.
i will be repurchasing again
i hate the price
not sure if i'll repurchase after trying premier cru the cream by caudalie
i tried a cheaper choice first
that time was my first time ever buying the 1
i knew i had to purchase this
i recommend it and i will repurchase it!
the price breaks the banks, though.
but i will repurchase.
it is pricey but worth it.
then bought the actual one
effective products that are worth the high price
i will buy it again,
i read all of the reviews before purchasing because this is on the pricey side

at first i was put-off by the pricetag
this i will defiantly repurchase again.

thinking of purchasing second one.
say it's worth the price tag
the price is pretty expensive

the results do not warrant the expensive price
cheaper i have no choice for now
i would probably repurchase.

i decided to buy it despite the price tag
i now have a back up in case the "oil-free" is not in stock
i decided to buy a jar
i will be buying this again for sure!
will probably repurchase again once i'm finished
if i can buy expensive makeup
for that price i'll pass
because it is so expensive i will pass for a cheaper br
the only con i have on this product is the price
it is well worth it
just bought this during the vib rouge sale
held off because of the price
i will definitely repurchase.
only con is the price
well worth the money
i can already tell it is well worth the price
i promise it is worth the money!
now that my sample is gone i will be rushing to sephora today to buy the full bottle
maybe get a discount on the next since it is a bit pricey
i'll definitely be purchasing it again.
if only the price was affordable.
read the reviews before purchase.
it is so worth it
they were sold out

i am not sure if it is worth the expense however.
i'd love to find a discount product that really works
i wish that you got a bigger container for the price
this is totally a repurchase!
that would save a great deal
the only downside is the price.
will see how long it lasts with such a high price tag

it is very expensive
only downhill is price!!!

i will repurchase this when it is done
it is definitely worth the price
i will be purchasing the rest of my life

the only downside is the price: it's a steep premium
got the 'hard sell' from the salesperson to buy this product
you will be shiny as a new penny
the price is definitely up there
but it's worth the splurge!
if you only have to buy it once a year it ends up cheaper than other br
not a bad price for how long it last
only draw back for me is the price

i am not rating based on price
wished to buy the product
for that reason, i'm ok with paying the price.

this product is worth every penny.
the price is a bit costly however
plus--you get more oil for your price compared to tatcha
price is higher but reasonable.
so that makes the price a little easier to swallow
is probably not a repurchase
while it is a higher price point than many alternatives
will continue to buy that as well
the price per oz of this one is actually really good
when i first saw this product i was very hesitant to purchase it due its high price
the only downside to amorepacific is the price
otherwise, it is worth every penny.
it is pricier than others
i love it and will be ordering it again!
other wise i would expend $500 in one shopping for this products
will buy as soon as what i have ends
the price doesn't quite justify it
i wish they'd bring some of their less pricey offerings
which was out of stock so i chose this.
sensitive to perfumes you may want to try it in store before you purchase online
is definitely worth the price
when i was introduced to this oil i almost did not purchase because of the 50

i would repurchase time

the only downside is the price
4 stars only due to price.

the price is on the high side

great [product and well worth the money spent.
as pricey as this product is, it shows its worth.
i won't be buying another one
'm not sure if i will be repurchasing

typically would never buy a $90 product
i will definitely buy it again when i run out.
yes, it's expensive, but worth every penny.

i love the product and would buy it again.
with the hefty price tag i was hesitant to buy this
sad about the price.
one might get a good benefit out of this investment

very nice addition and i will purchase again.
i think the results are worth it
i will continue to repurchase
which i would also recomend
i applied what i thought was going to be an overpriced waste of time
i would have given a higher rating

once i'm out of it i would not pay the actual retail price for this

don't be scared by the price
the price is hard to swallow
especially if you wait for the 20% off sale.
i don't have a problem with the price point
i will continue to purchase from the company!
you cant beat their prices for the same products
i would buy caudalie all the time

until i saw the price tag
i initially dismissed the idea of ever buying this product because it is so expensive
when i broke down the price per ounce based on my actual use
happy i did invest
i find the high price tag
it's worth purchasing if you have some money saved up to splurge on arguably one of the best face creams i have found on the market thus far
have to wait until i have a big paycheck until i buy more
if i could only purchase a couple of skin care essentials
worth every penny spent to keep my aging skin looking younger
the sales person insured me it would work
will keep making the investment.
this isn't a cheap product and i am on a budget.
so not sure if i will purchase because of the cost
not worth the price for the stink
'll have to save my pennies
then determine if the hefty price is worth it
ed with it because of the price
the first time i was going to buy this
the price is steep
i will probably buy it again.
pricey but worth it.
i would rather buy this product then buy food.

i still ended up paying some 10 bucks more
i would strongly consider purchasing this in the future

if you are debating because of the price
i only wish they sold a smaller version for more people to try it at a lower cost
i love it and will definitely buy more.

therefore i re purchased this again

i received this as part of a value set
otherwise probably wouldn't have bought it on its own
i don't think i'd repurchase this product
i would buy this again.
i usually buy the higher priced luxury br
s that i usually buy

it is worth every penny
the price is amazing
waste your hard earned money buying a br
buy the products that work instead
s cost more than this
this is worth it
a great product at a very reasonable price.
i keep repurchasing this gel
i just couldn't afford to keep purchasing it
for the price is it's comparable
definitely recommend and will repurchase!

it is pretty expensive but so worth the money.
it's worth the money
it's worth the money.
didn't repurchase for a while
i will use this jar, but will not buy it again.
this was an over-priced "miss" for shiseido in my opinion
when i saw the price i said..really!
buy this it is awesome!
yes it is pricey but worth it.
i will continue to purchase
anyone w/ crepy skin will consider this a small price to pay
the price did sting a bit
so far don't regret the purchase at all!
i am going to purchase my next jar
one well worth the money
the price is hard to swallow
liked everything about it buy its just too expensive
will buy it again.
if money was no option
for such a hefty price tag i dont feel its worth it for younger skin
i give it 4 stars only because of the price.
it lasts a long time...so worth the price.
worth every penny of the cost.
the price is crazy
t must be worth it
this one doesn't have that property
only reason i gave 4 stars is the price
the only bad thing is the price.
then decide if worth paying for
spend the money on this product 1
worth the investment because it lasts a year.
splurged on this expensive item
this is why i will keep buying this cream.
this cream more than makes up for all my lackluster past purchases
the price is high
of course it would have to be the one with the $100 price tag
not for the price
even with its $$$ price tag
otherwise very happy with this purchase
i can say it's definitely worth the cost
i will be buying this for winter without a doubt.
is well worth the price
i buy something different
pay for this one
only downside is the cost- it seems a bit extravagant to drop $99 on an eye cream alone
for the price i expect it to last longer.
when i first purchased this product
definitely will buy again!
this is my second purchase of this eye cream.
well worth the price.
i'll defiantly will repurchase before winter
i just wish more came for the price!
this product is well worth the seemingly exorbitant price tag
the amount of other creams i've bought with no results hits well over what this cost
i\yes it is a little pricey but it is worth it.
i will buy this again.
i believe it's worth the money
put off purchasing this for a long time
especially with the price
at a very reasonable price
the prices are reasonable for the quality of the products
purchased this new formula
this is my second time buying this cream
however i wish the price was more reasonable
that's how i buy this
for those put off by the price
just wish it was a bigger bottle for the price.
its half the price
thought the price was outrageous
i will buy again
i would purchase this again.
i am going to purchase this one again.
i wish it had a higher spf and lower price.
totally worth the splurge
defiantly worth the price!!
when i went to purchase this
they were out of stock
they had the cream in stock
i hope sephora hasn't stopped selling it.
nothing takes care of my eyes like this does will continue to repurchase
i keep trying to find cheaper options
it doesn't cost that much
definitely worth the price
trust me its worth the price
s down the best product i've purchased ever

it has a steep price
bought this in a holiday set
i only give this 4 stars because the price is not reasonable
i hope they lower their prices
the price is outrageous to say the least
this week's result alone is worth every penny spent
i think it is worth the price.
unfortunately the price is outrageous for a tiny amount
probably won't splurge on this one again
its a little pricey but it is worth it.
i will be buying this again.

i started using a different product because the price
it is very much worth the price
i liked this one enough to purchase it again

ended up buying the bigger version
the only down side to this product is the price
it may be expensive
only gave 4 stars because of its price tag.
favorite moisturizer wish i could afford to buy it all the time
if you are hesitant due to the price
the only downfall of course is the price!
was sold after first application
this one is definitely worth the money to me
already i am sold on this
the price of this cream is a bit of sticker shock
i did my research about the company before investing in it which makes me feel good about spending the money
it is worth the cost

could purchase other things i need or gifts just to get the generous deluxe of this stuff
i tried a less expensive product to save money.
i would give it 5 stars except for the price.
i will purchase this again
the quality actually warrants the hefty price tag
the price is up there but i think its worth it.
the price seems really high

it may cost a lot
i would not buy it again.
expensive, but worth it!
tried to get by without buying another jar as it was pricey

hopefully they stock more items
the only downside is the price.

if this was in my budget
probably i would do the splurge
this will for sure be a future purchase
as for the value
when the next vib sale happen i will be out of $175
so at this price point
just wish it was cheaper since i will probably purchase again
then i saw the price .
definitely worth the price.
not worth the hype.
it is totally worth it
i definitely want to invest in at least a small jar
the price is worth it.
have bought again and will continue to do so.
i think well worth the price tag
then it's wroth the purchase
i will be purchasing the full jar if i don't have any breakout
i came here to purchase
the price seems a little steep for the product though
it is very expensive
it's worth every penny
if i did purchase this
cant wait till it comes back in stock
the only negative is the price.
hard before purchasing it again
it is worth it
i will be buying more of this
once i get over the insane price tag
it is well worth the price
for those who question the price
with a coupon bought the full product
it really is worth it
i will definitely keep repurchasing
this was a total impulse buy
the only downside is
very happy with purchase.
i'll be buying this again!
you get a lot product for the price
this was my first algenist purchase
definitely will be re-purchasing!
you need to buy this
i still feel its worth it
i will definitely be repurchasing this again.
without the high price tag
i read this reviews for this cleanser which sold me on buying it
will buy it forever
the only downside is that it could be bigger for the price
it's worth the money
this is my third purchase.
it's a hefty price tag
i would absolutely repurchase!
restock during the sale
definitely worth the money, though.
'll spend the cash
totally worth the cost!
i balked at the price a bit
very pleased with my purchase!
i would never trade this in.
the price seems like a lot
i did a lot of research before splurging on this cream
which is the only reason i am still buying it for her
i will definitely purchase this again
they are worth the money
it is well worth the price.
my only complaint is the price
will keep buying over
the cream is pricey so i had high expectations.
i won't purchase again
eye --- i've now purchased it all
hawing about buying it because it is so expensive
at this point i would even plunk down the big bucks for it
i will pay $90 a jar if it will save me from spending money on foundations
i am going to re purchase this when i run out !
to me it is worth every penny
very expensive but worth it.
i will be buying the day cream.
is because its really expensive
my only gripe is the price.
would like a bigger jar at a better value.
expensive but really worth it.
in any case $90 was a lot to splurge on this
i felt that it was worth the money
purchased it during the 20% off promotion
i saw the price
i will be buying this product once sample runs out
this price is astronomical
overall take: worth the splurge.
though the price tag was more than i could afford
i wanted to try a new product to save my budget
however, i think it worth $90.
while it is expensive
think it's definitely worth the cost
the on downside is the price
make sure you stock up with your next 20% coupon like i did
gave it 4 stars because of the price.
so luckily i didn't have to pay full price
i will definitely be buying this product.
very worth the price
this is one i will definately be buying when my sample is gone
i will definitely repurchase.
as soon at this is back in stock it is going in my shopping basket
my only draw back is the price tag.
my only issue is the $90 price tag.
this is my third purchase.
this is my second purchase of the mask.
needed to purchase right away
when i first bought it
i just purchased this for the second time
purchased the actual product
but the product is worth it.
i decided to try this instead of repurchasing the dr
this product is totally worth it :
will re purchase when i need to
i feel like you get a good amount of product for the price
which is double the price of this
good price for the product :)
it may seem pricey at first
was thrilled to purchase one from this br
i just wish they sold different
the price is steep
this is really worth it
the only drawback here is the price.
i will be buying this tomorrow!
i subtracted one star for the price
so don't let the price tag deter you from purchasing
i feel obligated to share the results
say i am very surprised at the quality of this product given the price
it is pricey, but so worth it!!
it has definitely proven itself worth the money
this is the only fave cream i've ever repurchased
it's safe to say i will be buying more in the future

t was a great purchase for me
i recommend buying this for anyone who deals with oily skin

plus, the $25 is a really good price point.
they were all sold out
my next choice was to buy the cheapest one i could find

it costs a fraction of what one pays for glam glow
this was definitely the least expensive
the price is extremely reasonable
not sure if i will repurchase or continue the hunt for a "wow

not to mention it is half the price of the nars mask
i would definitely buy this again!
very pleased with the purchase.
i will buy it again when i run out
it's worth another comment
you get a lot for the price
including a pricey $60 one here at sephora
must be the mask :d price is good too!

so the price is probably more worth it for those with dry skin
i will repurchase when this bottle runs out.
worth the money for sure.

they stopped selling it individually
it was worth it
i now have an emergency stock of this
definitely going to be something i repurchase for weekly use
will be buying this for the rest of my life
will be buying this product again and again.
thought this cheaper product wasn't worth my time
i will absolutely be repurchasing this in the full size asap
it is deceptive in the amount you purchase
i disassembled the 'pump' before purchasing another jar
will have to seriously consider the value before re-purchasing
however this product is pricey with the amount of product you get
i did not read any reviews prior to purchase
the only huge huge huge downside is the price tag
only if you're able to pay the price
i would buy again
it just doesn't seem worth the price tag for how long it lasted
will most likely re-purchase
i would love it even more if there was more product for the price i pay
i feel that for the price
i just bought this the other day
seriously the best purchase i've made recently.
will definitely buy this again
i want to scrap every minute amount out before i buy more
still worth buying though!
not worth the money
i've repurchased this 3 times now
t's just a bit of a hassle to keep repurchasing it so frequently
this was one of the 1st high end skin care that i have ever purchased
i just wish it was cheaper.
if i had unlimited amounts of money i would buy this all the time
i will continue to buy!
great eye cream for a reasonable price!
i will be repurchasing
i would definitely repurchase
i will keep buying this!
i would repurchase this!
good quality for this price
i would definitely re-purchase.
it was so worth it
i will certainly buy again.
so the price is worth it
i will keep buying this product
i am ready to buy the product.
my opinion that it good cream for good price.
i will buy it again.
bought it on a whim
why buy something cheaper that doesn't work?
this is one of the few that i have ever repurchased
this is the first eye cream i've purchased.
i will be repurchasing this mainly for its side effect :
it is so worth it
the price is the only thing that prevents me from buying more often
i will be buying this again.
i love these and have purchased twice before.
with its affordable price equal amazingness
decided once again its worth a shot for the price
the price is awesome
which is the best cream i have ever bought
not a huge fan of the price.
the results make it worth it
i'd recommend it if you want to buy higher end products
the clinique line is at least reasonably priced next to some of the other lines at sephora
i think i will repurchase it
find it totally worth the cost
bought one for me
i remember feeling that it was worth every penny
in my opinion, worth the price.
which is the main reason i ended up purchasing
i am now sold as a clinique customer.
this is my second time purchasing this product
recently bought this newer one
it is well worth the purchase.
i stopped buying this to try other products
will happily continue to purchase this product
i would definitely repurchase in the future

it's a little pricey, but well worth the cost.
love it..will be repurchasing once i run out!
i know i'll be repurchasing this for the rest of my life
i think this stuff's almost a bargain
it is a tad expensive but it is worth every cent!
i would definitely buy this again.
the price is worth the quality you get
only downside is how expensive it is
i originally purchased the regular moisture surge
because it is expensive
have purchased a second time
which obviously costs you a pretty penny
it is pricey but it lasts a long time!
everything the sales associate said it would be.
i would definitely buy it again.
i originally balked at the high price since it was my first time purchasing an anti aging product
i will be buying the line of this.
the change in skin has been worth the price
this product is pricey, but well worth the cost.
but i would buy this again.
so, i was skeptical, especially at the price.
i'll probably buy it again.
it is expensive but worth it!
definitely worth the price.
i will forever use this product
this is a re-purchase for me
i hesitated because of the price
all in all, think it was worth the money!
immediately budgeted to purchase again

pricey but worth it !
this is a definite splurge that will be repeated
but it is worth it.
i will keep buying
it's expensive, but worth it for the results.
it was an investment
i will be purchasing again (and again, and again!
i will be going back this weekend to purchase
pricey of course, as perricone is.
have absolutely loved them despite their hefty price tag
i will continue investing in this product.
this is worth the try
m not sure i will repurchase
good eye serum for the money you pay.
although this product is on the high side with its price sometimes you have to pay for quality
i debated because of price.
will definitely re-purchase.
i also find the pricing to be ridic
it is worht the money for the results.
so i will be buying it again.
i would definitely purchase this product again!
it is pricey, but it is worth it.
i will definitely repurchase this product!
very good for the price-point.
definitely will keep purchasing!
i will definitely be buying this again after i run out
when i first bought it

this is def something i will be using for a while
i will buy it for sure again.
definitely worth the money!
i will definitely be purchasing!
i will be purchasing the $30 bottle from now because it is so worth it
so content with this purchase!!!

after buying this product
for whatever reason i didn't repurchase
i recently bought it again
it's totally worth the price tag
definitely worth the price.
i will purchase again.
i just bought my second.
i would have repurchased if it costs around 100 bucks
not 200 bucks for less than 1 oz of face oil
the price is high
i am going to purchase it
since the price is so high
it seemed like the review was only based on the price
will def purchase again!
the price tag is steep
it is very expensive, but worth every penny!!!!
priced well and far exceeded my expectations.
however it is worth every penny
a sephora salesperson said it has a lot of oil
s of dollars a year on another expensive br
have purchased 2 jars since.
although expensive to buy all at once
i would probably buy it again for $50
i cannot believe the price tag
saw the $94 price tag
i will be purchasing this from here on out
bought the big one now
it is well work the cost as a value
this is the only product i ever used that is absolutely worth the price
the price is steep so it will have to be gifted.
i'll repurchase until the winter when i think i'll need something heavier
i will be buying it
it is an investment
the only bad part is the price
it's definitely a product i would consider splurging on
it is pricey, but well worth it.
the algenist is a little cheaper.
t's definitely worth the price
if you want results, you have to pay the price.
wish it was cheaper though1
although it's not the cheapest product
it has paid off well
can'r make it into the city to buy more
well worth the price.
love this stuff, worth every penny!
will buy again and again!
will definitely continue to purchase
it was really out of my price range
i wouldnt pay this price unless it really worked.
it is worth the investment
it is expensive, but well worth every penny.
i've spent a ton of money trying every miracle cream available

could be just subjective for the price paid
the price tag is worth it
it's expensive so might try something cheaper next time
will keep buying it.
will keep buying it without stopping
this product is well worth my first one
i will be buying this again along with other products from this line
i will not be buying this product again.
since money is a consideration for me
a sale associate at sephora suggested this product to me
only downside is price
will not repurchase due to unfortunate cost per ounce
for the price this is the best in my opinion!
very likely to buy again.
i'd definitely purchase this again
you may have to repurchase 2-4 times a year based off of your use
purchased it 3 times already.
it totally is worth the money.
i love this product so much that i've repurchased it every year since 2012
will definitely be repurchasing
so this stuff is definitely worth the price
t ends up being a great value anyway
and i will buy it until i can't buy it anymore!
please don't stop selling this sephora
it's worth every penny!
it's worth every penny
korres has been completely out of stock now
it is no longer in stock anywhere
while it is on the pricey side
expensive....but worth every penny.
despite its expensive price tag i can't seem to live without it
this is probably the fifth jar i have purchased.
it is pricy but it does last a long time.
the ridiculous price is the only downside
move on to the next product
this is definitely a splurge

i picked it up with the vib pre-sale on sale end of year extravaganza
i know the price is high for what may seem like a nominal amt of product
it is very expensive
i will definitely buy again
if that proves to be true, i *might* repurchase.
well worth the price.
it is expensive but worth it.
it was worth every penny!
mpressed by the immediate results that i had to buy it
it is now time for me to repurchase this product

worth the cash people.
great product and will buy it again.
company i decided to drop the cash on it
this product was recommended to me by a sephora store employee when i was in to purchase make up for ever sens'eyes
this should be worth grabbing
one star off because of the price
the price is so justified
i tried this in sephora and bought one.
i initially bought this product for my husb
i will keep buying it !
it isn't a lot of product, not for the price.
bought it on the spot
i would buy it again.
my original plan was to buy this
will buy again regardless of high price tag.
not enough product for the price
i am repurchasing this becasue i like the cooling
it is a bit small for the price
bought this on a whim
the price is right
will be buying it again
it would be the amount of product.
i'll still continue to buy it though--amazing product
worth the extra step
it is not that pricey
i didn't want to pay the price for it
which is great considering this jar costs a pretty penny
this is well worth the price.
wasn't upset by the purchase
for me the price is really worth it!
i hesitated to pay the price for this
it is absolutely worth it
i will continue buying it
even with a very high price tag on it
i will definitely be repurchasing it
4 stars because of the price.
it costs more than i would normaly pay for moisturizer
it's worth every penny
i truly believe it's worth the investment
i owe it all to omorovicza products
they would still be worth every penney
i recently purchased another moisturizer around the same price point
expensive but well worth it!
i take off one star for the price
not cheap but worth every penny.
i truly believe it's worth the investment
i truly believe it's worth the investment
not sure i would repurchase due to the price
but every penny worth it.
the amount of product i use probably is equivalent to about $10 worth of product
you could buy a lot more products for the money
i truly believe it's worth the investment
bought a second jar before the end of my vib discount
t's a good value in the long run
well maybe not the price
though this product is pricey i am in love!
it is expensive, but i would buy it again.
it is definitly worth the price.
that the price is high
this product is worth every cent.
a bit of a splurge price- wise
this is a splurge for sure
i truly believe it's worth the investment
invested in this cream
i don't think i will repurchase it
if it wasn't so expensive i might consider buying it again
the price is expensive 225 dollars i have never spent that much on a mositurizer
will purchase again and again.
in no way justifies the price
i would repurchase if it was cheaper.
i will definitely re-purchase even with the price
i truly believe it's worth the investment
will re buy again.
i will definitely consider buying this once my current moisturizer runs out
both are the same price for the same amount of product
i think i found something that i'll continue purchasing
i will keep buying because it truly saved my skin
not sure if it's worth the price
definitely worth every cent.
the final selling point for me were the ingredients
i read reviews before purchasing about the smell of the oil
is it worth the price tag?
still deciding if i would repurchase as i'm not at the point where i can't live without it
i think this oil is so worth the money.
i don't think i would repurchase after i'm done with my bottle
yes i will be repurchasing it
it is more than worth it
it is pricey but well worth it.
i will continue to repurchase it.
will be buying a backup immediately.
i would buy this oil again despite the price.
beautiful oil will always repurchase!
the only downfall is it's hefty price.
my main concern was to see if this item was truly worth every penny
if you're willing to invest in this item
the price is a little high
i gave this product a 4/5 because of the price.
it is so expensive, but so worth it!
definitely worth the price
as far as price goes, it is a splurge product.
i think it is worth it
was reluctant because of the price tag
i know $90 is an investment
for me it's a worthwhile investment
this glorious oil is worth every penny.
overall to me this product is worth the money
it is worth the price tag!
i did so much research before splurging on this product
totally worth the price tag.
it's expensive but worth every penny.
i will definitely re-purchase
this product may be a bit expensive
i am not sure it is extra-special enough to justify the price
which is another strike against repurchase for me
i personally will not put a price tag on look-in good
the expensive price is the one downside
the product seems worth the money for the worth it does
it's worth every penny!!!
i usually product hop after a while cause the price
will continue to buy as long as it works on me.
it is worth every penny
will be buying another soon
as soon as i can i'm splurging for this product

one star off cause of the price.

bottom line it's worth the price
the price tag is a bit steep
the price is a high but it does last a long time.
will definitely be repurchasing.
the price is a little high
the product seems worth the money for the worth it does
definitely will continue to repurchase despite the steep price tag
it is 100% worth the price tag.
it is well worth it
now that i've purchased it
because of its very high price tag
i guess i will have to buy it!!!
not a fan of the price tag
looking at the price
thinking who would buy something this expensive?

none the less i will be repurchasing
although it is pricey
i will keep buying.
think it’s likely worth the price
it is definitely worth it!
worth the buy like many have stated 3-4 months of use
it was a splurge but i'll repurchase
but this product worth my time.
i did stop using it due to the cost
so back to sephora's i went however i did buy it in a set which was cheaper than buying the individual bottle
i find it is worth it
it has a hefty price tag
forces them to repurchase sooner
that being said i will probably repurchase due to the excellent results
that makes it worth the money
the results are worth it
i will buy another bottle.
it is worth the price
i am back to buy a second bottle.

50 bucks is very reasonable
sephora won't think i've lost interest
if you're even considering buying this product
i wish i had bought the cream at the same time.
also the cheapest in the prize winners
should be your major splurge besides foundation
it is however, pricey.

it is well worth the splurge
can i say that it is 100% worth the cost, no.
i would encourage all dry skinned customers to purchase this cream over any other sold at sephora
this is expensive--too expensive for anyone with a limited budget to keep purchasing
when sephora gives me another 20 percent discount or $20 off coupon
i will not be repurchasing, though.
am unsure if i will repurchase
it has been well worth the investment both financially
well worth every penny
will totally be repurchasing this product
yes its pricy but worth it!!
expensive but worth the money
i splurged on this because of the great reviews
i don't love the price
i am purchasing again because it works
the only reason i gave it 4 stars is the price.
wish it cost less
although pricey, this is my second jar.
this is the first eye cream i have ever purchased
doubt i would repurchase
it is expensive, but it lassts
invest in this you won't be disappointed.
it's listed as "permanently out of stock"?

i will be buying some, even at the price of $80
worth every penny i spent on it
will continue to re-purchase!
will defiantly keep buying!
splurged during a 20% off deal
that hefty price tag
worth it if you can make the investment.

from what i can tell with the sample that i received is that the price is worth it

even though the price is on the higher end
you can refund it within 30 days
i almost didn't buy this product line because i was so skeptical
only negative is the price.
yes, it is pricey, but worth every penny.
try the sample before splurging on the buy
so worth the mention
so stop reading and buy it!!!
only negative is the price
given the price point: believe me
had no idea how expensive it is to purchase
i think i will end up buying the pump.
for the money it is worth it!
didn't purchase due to price
it may be pricey but it is well worth it.
i would complain about the price
will continue to use it until something else comes on the market
the price is higher than most
try to smell it in the store before purchasing
at first i thought the price was too expensive
for the price factor
it took me a while to be convinced of the hefty price tag
paid the price for the cream
too overpriced though judging by its results
i do think the price is a bit steep
at many price points
this is the first i feel is worth every penny
my previously favorite cream was out of stock for a long time
though they are pricey
great for the price!
probably won't buy again
i deff plan on repurchasing
i still bought it anyway

this is my very first review on any proudct i've purchased at sephora
only down side is the price.
i wouldn't buy the serum from him since i get the timeless one for really reasonable price
she insisted on buying this
the price is higher than what i would like
about to buy some now, it's def.
i would definitely buy this product
i will buy it again
the money you spend is worth it!!!
it's well worth the price
it is a good deal since most moisturizers about half the size cost about the same price or more
it is the least expensive item i use
purchased because i was told by salesperson that this product really works great on sun spots
i buy these on a regular basis
it’s true that the price is very high
am finding the same results for a better price
i decided to purchase another black tea product again

at this price point , i probably won't purchase.
00 or below price point
although it is at a higher price point
its totally worth it <3
i keeps me buying it
however i will wait for the next black tea gift set to purchase
that it is well worth the price
another con is that it is expensive!
since it lasts so long i'll be buying when i finish my current eye cream
although at first i thought it had a pretty hefty price tag
i'll be purchasing this when my cream runs out
the price tag hurts at first
till i saw the price
not at that price
four stars because of the price
i will continue to purchase!
n my opinion its worth the cost
it's worth the price.
it doesn't seem worth the high cost
even if i could have bought it the was sold out.
but it worth every penny!
i never spend this much in one item
i will definitely purchase again.
it's worth every cent
my one complaint is that the product is said to expire after 6 months' use
its so worth the price
i already purchased the second cream
its pricey but worth it.

i will be repurchasing
i wish it was a little more affordable

i think it is overly priced.
results justifies the price alone

i would recommend asking for a sample of any glamglow mask before paying for one since the price is so high
my only issue is the price.

i believe it to be worth the hype
will continue purchasing until i find a product even more moisturizing
i will 1000% be buying the large version of this.
i will be purchasing this one in the future.
buy a mask as they are expensive
prior to receipt of this product i always thought glamglow was over-hyped/over-priced

exceptional product worth every penny

that is quite a price tag
the price is just beyond my budget
price tag is steep but completely worth it.
i think it is worth every penny
although the price is up there

the only thing stopping me from purchase is the high price point
(gave it 4 stars only for the price)

the price is the only thing holding me back from buying this
unfortunately for the price
definitely worth a try if it is within your budget

i will never spend $150
i am hesitant to purchase again because of it.
it is definitely worth the money!
i got this mask at a discount retailer so be on the lookout because it's so good

free gifts with purchase
sephora to decide which store offers the best value
l'occitane still sells my very first l'occitane purchase of the deluxe devine gift set

repurchasing my 3rd jar.
is worth every one of your hard earned pennies
i actually bought it for my husb
i do feel that this product is over-priced :
seriously worth buying or trying
worth every penny as a little goes a long way.
its a bit pricey but for me worth every penny.
the price is fair
which is a big deal
i've never fully bought into expensive serums in the past
i've repurchased this bottle 3 times now
it is expensive get a sample before purchasing.
i wish the price was a tad lower
will be restocking for sure
i hate buying an expensive serum to have it run out quickly
i would compare it to premium br
definitely not cheap but worth it!
except for the price
it is worth every penny
likely won't be buying this anytime soon
that would be expensive
i will consider purchasing this product down the road
i will definitely purchase again.
although the price is a little hefty
i think it is worth it
unfortunately the price is way out of my range.
only thing i'm not liking is the price of this serum
my wallet does notice the price difference
this seems a bit pricey for a 2 week supply?
i hope they don't raise the price
this is so worth it.
i will purchase again.
i don't usually review a lot of my purchases on sephora
definitely will buy again
since it is expensive
i ususually don't spend this much money on a single product
its worth every penny
i would have never purchased this product of my own accord
this product is so worth the money
will continue to repurchase again and again.
a sample i wasn't even going to cash in on
it may be pricey
yes it seems like a lot to pay upfront
i will keep buying this amazing product
i agree that the price is a bit high
but price is too expensive.
i think it is a little bit overpricing
bought this for my travel bag
i will definitely buy again.
i can deal with it.
i absolutely plan on purchasing this.
not worth the price but is a decent eye cream.
great value for the money.
i'll be buying this again.

a little pricey but worth it
the end result is worth it
go buy this right now
i will definitely repurchase it.
i will definitely buy again.
i will buy this again
now regret not buying the full product
the only reason it gets a 4 star instead of 5 is because of the outrageous price
will be purchasing my own as gift to self for mother's day
about the price: it costs $145
i will be finding a way to purchase it again when this jar runs out
it's worth the price!
also it is very pricey.
i do think it's worth the hefty price tag :
have since repurchased another bottle
i intend to buy the full product though pricy
because for all of what it does for my skin it is the same price of all the products i buy to fix those concerns
it's worth every single penny :)
4 stars only because of the price.
i gave it 4 stars because of price.
its worth the money.
i will be very sad once my sample is done as i like to purchase the biggest size of products offered as it's a better bargain for your money
it is so expensive but worth it.
i will be repurchasing and repurchasing.
totally worth the price.
it is so worth the price.
just bought another bottle !
i couldn't remember how many times i have repurchased this product
skincare is always worth the splurge if you can afford it
will def be purchasing once my sample finishes.
this is an expensive mosturizer.
i will be repurchasing when i run out
is even through it is worth every penny
it does not last more than a month if you buy the 1oz bottle
the price for the next size up is not worth what you are getting
i will definitely purchase again once i figure out how to trim down my expenses
it's worth every penny.
i would 100% recommend buying this.
this is one of the few products that i will splurge on over
over because it is worth every penny
then had to buy the product
this is the best product that i have ever purchased
i i think its a small price to pay for the magic that is found in this jar
pricey but worth it
i will be repurchasing as soon as its back in stock
so far it is worth the money.
will buy this again
dry patches- buy this now
it's a little expensive but 100% worth the price!
i will keep buying this over and over.
i plan on buying more when it is in stock.
happy with the purchase.
the price really is steep for a cleanser so 4 it is
will wait to see how long this lasts before deciding to rebuy
having it last a long time is cheaper than buying a bottle of the cheap stuff once a month
this was my first purchase for this algenist product
i will purchase it again as my husb
around this price range
i would pay $50 for this!
totally worth the money!
i will definitely be buying more when i run out.
i got this in a value set
the price seems a little high
i will definitely be repurchasing
because it has been worth every penny
this one has a nice price point
i wasn't interested in paying an arm
so girls and boys buy buy buy!!!
stock up while sephora is having the 2x points promo
i'll continue to purchase it because of how great it is
i didn't like the price of their products
i will definitely buy again
so although the price may be somewhat high
i will buy the full version of this line.
bought this product online about month
worth the money in my opinion
will definitely be repurchasing when i run out.
i wish i had repurchased the algenist eye renewal balm instead of deciding to try this
this is one product i would actually repurchase
i think the price is very reasonable for the quality of the product
i will repurchase this item.
this is one of the cheaper
will buy it again.
the price is a little expensive
totally worth the money, for me.
i will keep buying this product!!
i like it so much that i repurchased.
they need to sell this in a large format
for the same price
because it is already pricey
i wouldn't repurchase only because of the price.
for a very affordable price
i will definitely repurchase.
since this is pricey
i will definitely be repurchasing when i run out.

i will recommend and repurchase.
worth the extra step
not over priced like some of the big name br
it is pricey but worth the money.
i think it'll be worth the purchase despite the price
as it is priced at $70
it is worth every penny
the only wipes they sell
i will continue to repurchase this item
i doubt i will purchase this again due to the smell
worth the ticket price
my only complaint is the price
would give 5 stars for quality were the amount sold not so small for the price
try it for 2 weeks; worth the pricetag...
was the price really worth it?
one thing to note when buying perricone is you're not only paying for the name
i am definitely on the fence about repurchasing due to this high price point
still think it is a worthy purchase
when buying on the website
i know the price is a little high
it is definitely worth it
bought it the next day
did not want to repurchase because of the hefty price tag
probably won't be repurchasing
will def buy again
will buy 5 more of these!
i will keep repurchasing
i would definitely recommend and repurchase
def will keep buying for travel
i just recently purchased the belif true cream
this stuff i will likely be repurchasing for the unforeseeable future

it is really worth the money!
i went to sephora to buy another product
i will be going to buy another bottle
although, i liked it, i won't be buying it again.
pricey but worth it!
the reason that i deducted a star is due to the value of the product
i would consider buying this if it came in a pump bottle
i don't plan to repurchase.
def purchasing when i run out!
wish it was cheaper
a great price for the quality that you get
will most likely buy when sample runs out.
the price is outrageous
this will be my next sephora purchase.
because of the price tag
for the price i expected it to wow me
i am going to invest in either the 1oz or 1
i'll definitely continue to repurchase this product
after that i had to buy it.
i would def buy this product.
bought during the rouge sale
if you don't care about the price then buy it!
the price is a little steep
will definitely be purchasing in the near future
so worth every penny.
by the time you buy cheaper products without the same results you might as well just buy the product from the beginning
i will be buying it immediately.
definitely worth the price.
now is it worth $75 dollars??
overall very good product that i would personally buy
if it was cheaper
it is pricey, but it does work.
i don't buy a lot of $75 products
this is so pricey
it is worth trying!!
this was a splurge product, but very effective.
totally worth the price
pricey but worth it!
repurchased this with 2 other bottles
you get a discount on your first purchase with them
totally worth the price.
i'll definitely be buying it again
i wish each bottle was bigger for the price.
still on the fence on if i will repurchase though
pricey but worth it!
it is overpriced for the amount you have to use each time
i would use this again if there is another sample option bit i will not purchase for the price point
i am planning on purchasing
i would have given it 5 stars if the price was more reasonable
80$ is too high of a price point for this product in my opinion
it will last you a while too for the price.
i will definitely repurchase this again
i will wait til the next vib event to repurchase since the price is pretty steep
that might be my next purchase to add to my routine
i will repurchase this to continue in my skincare routine
went to buy one for my self
overpriced for what it is.
i will forever use this product!
will most definitely repurchase
it is a little steep in price
will be repurchasing over
this is a must have item!
this is well worth the splurge
you get a lot of product for the price
you do need to reapply after approx.
if it were cheaper
good stuff though and will rebuy!
will definitely purchase this item!

i will continue to repurchase
super happy with this purchase
will repurchase for sure
plain to continue buying these products
you cannot beat the price

in the end it becomes worth it
i will continue to purchase this product after my first one runs out

i think i will definitely be purchasing soon!
which i also plan on buying
i will purchase this again

i won't be in such a rush to buy it back to back
the price is pretty high
not so much better that it justifies double the price

no regrets on this purchase.
i will definitely repurchase it

for the price i doubt i will
i deciding to buy this product
completely worth the splurge.
the price may seem steep at first
the price is amazing for 3
i strongly recommend getting the set at a much more reasonable $60-$70 price point
i only rated it four stars because the price of one jar is ridiculous
that it was worth it
i will be buying this product at some point
it's worth every penny.
the price tag hurts
this product is worth every penny.
expensive product, but so worth it!
i will definitely be purchasing this
the price is hefty
the product is totally worth every penny
i don't know that it is worth the price
you seriously need to invest in this.
i don't know if i will repurchase because of the price
was being too cheap to repurchase
even though the price point is on the higher side
i would love to keep buying this

junky buyer when it comes to trying products .

visible results 1st time used by a samples will definitely buy worth the money
i will continue to buy this cleanser over any other
won't be purchasing it again
will most likely be repurchasing it once it's empty
i plan on buying this face wash again
definitely will buy again
bought this when it was on sale because why not
on top of all that, it received a price drop!
not worth spending money on
i got this because it was on sale and it's great.
i probably would not have paid full price for it
since it was on sale
the value of the product is great
def will repurchase before i run out
they were selling the small version of this
for $5.99 so i had to buy and use.
i think for the price
it's worth every penny for the quality of product it is
it is definitely worth the money

the only issue i have is the majority of the time the pump won't pump
it is a little pricey but definitely worth it.
bought because tatcha's camellia cleansing oil was out of stock both times i tried to buy it last week
will not repurchase after this bottle is empty
i'll go ahead and say it is also a great value.
it costs almost as much
since it is so expensive
too expensive to be wasting product.
don't like the price
because it is expensive
definitely a repurchase for me!
i will continue buying it
it is worth every penny
it is very expensive
of course i took advantage of the vib sale
i will definitely be restocking on this.
don't love the price
i'd like to see less expense put into the packaging to bring the price point down a bit

i wish it was more affordable
it isn't as effective as i expected it to be at this price point
nice, but i most likely won't repurchase.
becuase it costs less
i prefer not to use a million products at the end of the day
will be repurchasing after finishing my play box sample
i love it and i will purchase it again and again.
i think i've purchased 3 bottles of this.
however, it's definitely out of my price range.
defiantly will be buying again
the price being its only negative
box subscription is working out for me.

it is absolutely worth the price
this was an major impulse buy for me
when i run out i will buy from another br
i just can't justify paying 5x more for the same oil

the only thing that was holding me back was the 70 dollar price tag for 1 oz
if you're contemplating buying it
i've purchased 80 percent of their line
the splurge is so worth it
seeing the price at first made me a little skeptical about buying it
i've already purchased it twice!
when i first bought this product

especially for the high price
i'd love to find a more affordable option
was a little hesitant due to price

i am amazed only purchased the mini version to try going to have to buy the full it will hurt my wallet
seriously- buy this stuff.

when i buy it, i always by 2 extra for backup.
this is a great investment
the price is fair
buying my third just in case
of course so little product for the price
plan to buy more after finishing what i have

this is my third time purchasing this product
the value is pretty worth it since you don't have to use that much

i recently bought this item
definitely worth every single penny!
i will definitely repurchase this product!
to me it is worth it
after buying this new
the price tag is a little high
i would say it's worth the splurge
i feel pretty good about the results-for-price exchange of this product
especially at this price point
fair priced compared with department fancy useless br
the price is reasonable yet the result is amazing
i may have to stock up!
this is a good buy ladies.
i will definitely be repurchasing.
the price seems high for what it is
but i will definitely be repurchasing this item.
i will be buying the st
i will definitely be repurchasing this product in the future

i absolutely plan on repurchasing it myself when i run out
can't wait to buy more products from this line!
will continue to keep buying this product
i highly recommend to at least try a sample out before making the purchase
i buy this regularly
will be buying again!
when i saw that this was on sale i decide to give it a shot
i will purchase this forever.
it has been worth every penny
this product is definitely worth a try!
again comparing the price
the number of uses i get out of it makes me question whether i should repurchase or not
i will be repurchasing!
i won't be re-purchasing my purity when it runs out
i will definitely be repurchasing.
who can really put a price on that?
will definitely buy again.
because i would immediately buy like
i will absolutely repurchase.
i am definitely repurchasing.
at first i did not want to buy this product bc of the price
(expensive, but so worth it)
i would recommend this product and repurchase.
i am already planning on buying again
overall great cleanser just wish the price was the same at my local store
overall worth the money!
but definitely worth every penny!!
will definitely purchase it again.
i will be purchasing it as soon as i run out of the sample
wouldn't usually spend my money on
this is the first time i have purchased a facial oil
it is definitely expensive
would definitely recommend buying it to mix with your foundation
i am sure that i will be purchasing this again.
was hesitant to purchase it
i will re purchase :)
i will be buying over and over again!
not with the price
this stuff is worth the money- feels amazing on skin- despite the price will repurchase
which is a big bonus
i would never just buy this product since it is higher price
i will definetly buy this product.
i initially bought this because i love the ultra repair cream
i've bought this twice now.
t's definitely worth the price in my opinion
will buy this over and over.
it was priced lower
when i first bought this
i didn't realize when i was first purchasing
not a bargain priced product
i truly believe for 30 dollars 2 ounces is not enough
i will definitely buy this product again
will repurchase over and over again
i am planning to buy the largest possible!
glad i tried it and will be buying it again.
good price for a product that lasted me a while
i probably would buy this product in the future.
it's definitely worth the investment
i will definitely be buying more.
is definitely priced right
i need to buy a backup honestly.
so much cheaper than the big name br
will definitely be buying this
the price is great too.
it is a good priced product and is effective.
totally recommend for the price
not the 70 dollar price tag
i can't believe the price tag considering the benefits
plus you get a lot of product for the price!
i will be repurchasing
can't beat the quality that goes with the price
best product i've ever purchased.
will be buying this forever.
especially for the price.
this product is cheaper
the price difference makes up for it
i will definitely be repurchasing!!!!
great product, super reasonable price.
not only do i love the affordable price
the price is also an added plus!
it works like a high-end mask without the price.
$20 on a mask for me is splurging.
if your debating between which one to buy
great price for a good amount of product!
for less than half the price
will definitely repurchase once i'm out!
this is the first ever sephora product i have purchased
the price i figured
i wish there was more product for the price
this one is 1/3 of the price
they work like high end at the cost of drugstore
overall an amazing buy!
didn't want to spend an obscene amount of money for a small amount of product like with glamglows supercleanse
totally worth the buy!
decided to try one at a better price
face was soft and i am buying two more.
definitely worth it at such a great price!
this mask is a must and i will be repurchasing.
it was out of stock
the price is too steep for my budget
i just repurchased this online though
your student loan debt
it's a third of the price
just under a third of the price
if you are on a budget
would def buy again!
i just purchased this mask
the price can't be beat either.
soft so overall it was worth buying
will be purchasing again also
will continue to purchase in the future
you can't beat the price on this mask
i will definitely repurchase this mask.
will definitely buy again.
can't be beat with its price point
an amazing value not only for the product
at under $20 this is a huge deal!
honestly, for the price- you.
good value for price.
i will be buying this again.
definitely a good buy for the price!
will repurchase once i'm done.
defiantly will buy again
definitely gonna be repurchasing when i run out!
will never stop repurchasing lol
always on sale in store!
for the price point
loads of product for a very reasonable price
i would buy this over fresh rose mask
such a great purchase that i went ahead
this is a very good price point
i will be purchasing this product again
i would re purchase it on clearance
i probably wouldn't pay full price for it
may consider repurchasing if not interested in trying something new
something i'll invest in again.
one of my best purchases.
bought this for something different.
although it was about half this price in italy
i am repurchasing it
i would repurchase it again
will definitely purchase again
probably won't buy it again
i needed something inexpensive as i had 5 dollars left on a gift card
if they sold a bigger version for a reasonable price that would be great
this was my first purchase at sephora
definitely will continue to purchase for him
will repurchase when i run out
this was my first face oil purchase.
pricey but worth the investment.
i will be buying it for life
i am definitely going to purchase the full bottle of this oil
only bought the cream
i'll still probably buy it again when it runs out
'll be purchasing a full bottle
plan to re-purchase immediately
3x the price of this
probably one of the more pricier items that origins has
i definitely will purchase it.
the reason i ultimately purchased this was because of its brightening
will probably purchase again
will probably not purchase again due to messiness
i will buy this little one again
i’ll buy more if they put it in a glass bottle.
i would buy it again just for the smell!
would say definitely worth the investment
the price tag can be a little daunting
it is worth every cent
i will continue to buy this over and over.
worth every penny in my opinion.
decided i actually needed to buy it
i would purchase it if it was a little cheaper.
immediately bought this product
this is worth every penny!
i did repurchase this because it made a huge difference in my skin
i honestly bought this on a complete whim.
or just buy the mask
don't think i'll be purchasing again
i may re-purchase when i run out.
i would definitely buy this again
ncredibly pricey for the amount of product that you get
totally worth the investment!
repurchase ... need i say more
i know its pricey but it is so worth it!!
using a lot less foundation/powder makes it worth the price tag
i will buy this until i die!
id buy this again.
i definitely will be repurchasing.
i went back to purchase this
i will purchase at a later time.
the price for the size makes me hesitant to repurchase
i would buy this again.
i am definitely going to have to purchase a bottle of this

definitely going to be purchasing this product again
smooth for combination skini will buy it again
the price seemed reasonable

it does the job for half the price
i'll definitely keep repurchasing this mask!
the price seems steep
it is an investment but worth every penny!
the reason i gave 4 stars instead of 5 is the price
and the price is awesome!!
i can buy it guilt free!
would definitely recommend & buy again.
my only complaint, like others, is the price.
i gave 4 stars because for the ounce/price ratio it's pretty expensive
will continue to repurchase this one
it's half the price
if this keeps happening i will definitely be repurchasing
for the clearing properties alone i would purchase it as a solo product
will definitely purchase again.
i will probably buy it eventually
which was already worth it considering i got three masks for the price of this one
it's unfortunate sephora sells it for twice the price
definitely wouldn't buy it for this price
decided to give it a shot especially because it is sold in pharmacies
will re-purchase over and over again for sure!
i would purchase again.
i will definitely purchase.
i will definately buy this again
once i run out, i will definitely buy one!
i mean good price for trying.
will definitely purchase again.

ill buy it again for sure
it may be pricey but it's worth it.
also, you can't beat the price!
i will without a doubt buy again.
this fit the bill and is at a great price point.
the best part is it's less than half the price of glamglow
would do for a fraction of the price
the smell is a small price to pay for what this oil does to the skin
very worth the money!
this is my second purchase
during the next vib sale of course.
it's worth every penny.
will forever re purchase!!!
absolutely worth the money!

the sephora collection coming from mac i was apprehensive for the cheaper price point
at such a reasonable price
the price point is fair
