not greasy at all
it doesn't strip or make me face feel tight
not at all dry or tight
my girlfriend brought to my attention that it has a time release anti-wrinkle ingredient that continues to work on your skin long after you've washed
this is an amazing product for those with dry skin
especially for hot weather
i did enjoy how quickly this cream absorbs
sometimes my undereye area gets really dry
packaging make it hard to squeeze the last bit out of there
break outs while soothing unlike any other cream i have tried
don't think of it of a scrub
one dab of this is enough for all over.
occassionally get dry skin in the winter
i think i probably get a more instant calming effect from my chilled sheet masks
i sweat in my t zone area though
for those whose skin need moisture
i've purchased this in the past when my skin was super mad at me from too much retinol
i am justifying it as i'm not caking myself in color correctors anywhere near as much anymore
super sensitive skin everything breaks me out into i try this i'm
within five minutes my face didn't burn or itch anymore
doesn't feel super heavy or oily
sometimes in the morning if i want extra calming
it doesn't all disappear into the skin
the rest of my face whether it be from a harsh mask i tried or really just because my face is naturally red
now alot of people are complaining that its not moisturizing
the hollows of my under eye sockets look like they need a filler or something bc i get these bags that always make me look tired
many creams make me itch, puff up or break out.
it's not noticeable once you work this product into your skin
this would be excellent for severely dry or peely skin which i occasionally have in the winter
this was too sticky
my face felt extremely sticky like it had glue all over it all night which is the opposite of soothing
nothing sticky about it
it did calm down some of my redness in my face from the peel i did prior to applying it
didn't make me oily at all
it's now my go-to cream for any dry spots.
f you have oily skin or live in a humid climate
googled it to make sure i didn't need to wash it off because it was so sticky
soft unless i was wearing it
it continued to be dry
they always make my skin red
never fully take away dryness
in the middle of winter even when i'm taking mucinex which dries you out
it fixed my dry skin after one use
something i would usually never pick out for myself since i have oily skin
heavy moisturizer that doesn't make me wake up with greasy nasty skin
though it has made my skin a little more oily than usual
if you use too much it will leave your skin feeling oily
if he doesn't wash
your skin will just eat it up
it helped with my dry skin so much
my face develops some dry patches throughout the day that makes my face look like a dehydrated lawn
unlike a lot of oils i've tried it absorbs right into the skin without leaving a greasy look
i live in a cold and dry winter climate.
my skin was starting to feel like scales as it was so dry
this oil fixed my dry skin problem countless other products could not
it's not like other oils that feels gross or heavy
for anyone suffering with dry skin this is the product for you
as someone with parched skin i am a huge fan of oils
with the winter months coming i wanted to add some extra moisture to my face
it soaks right in and does not leave it greasy.
it does not feel oily or heavy on the skin
plump instead of being able to feel the oil on the skin
this line for those with dry skin
it smells so good i use it on my body -- there are flakes of gold in it
the best part is that it doesn't make my hair look greasy
you lose less since it seeps in almost immediately
i can use it as a last step in my regimen or mix a drop or two in my foundation for a dewy look
or too dry that just sits on my face without being absorbed at all
it is light enough so my skin completely drinks it up
powder- it's so hard to make my makeup look good regardless of the fact that i've replicated every beauty video i've seen for dry skin application
it's easier to spread onto my skin without losing much if any at all
it gives my foundation that little bit of extra moisture
absorbs into your skin like no other product you've tried
with winter my skin got so dry
it doesn't brake me out or clog my pores my skin has honestly never looked
btw i love to rub any left over oil on my elbows
i usually have oily skin
i've always had dry dry dry skin
no more dry skin!!
when i wake up i don't feel as though i need to immediately throw on bb cream or concealer just to get rid of the tired morning look
this is the only night cream that provides my skin with the hydration it needs during the cold weather without breaking me out
i wake up not oily
my makeup looks nice again without breaking up due to dryness
it often seems like nothing can protect it from losing its moisture
don't find my skin as dry as it often is during this time
i do not thing it is firming enough for extra mature skin
t smooth face it leaves me with after i peel it off
the peeling part does not hurt at all
if you don't apply a thick enough layer
it won't peel off easy so use a generous amount
i don't think it is strong or adhesive enough to clear pores-i haven't found anything that does that except for a pore strip
it's thin enough that you can apply it evenly
there is a tightening feel as it dries
i can't say for sure whether that is an actual lasting effect or just the mask drying on my skin
i do wish i could find a peel mask that would clear my pores as well
definitely not over drying.
did not irritate my skin at all
you can get about 10 full masks out of this bottle
not so much that it irritates my skin
the only reason i got it was because of its cool color
my only complaint is that you have to layer it on kind of thick
you have to use it as a peel off mask
i would put it on thicker next time
it is a bit sticky going on
you do need to apply a heavy layer
it was difficult to peel off
once it is completely dry
you get to peel it off
it doesn't apply to the skin easily
you definitely need a brush for application though
i read somewhere that this product is full of alcohol so your skin feels tight
if you do not have a mask brush i think a basic dense flat founation brush is totally ok to use
even though i didn't think i applied enough product it still peeled off nicely
other than that there wasn't really anything that set this mask apart from other peel-off masks
even though i wasn't sure i'd put a thick enough layer on
didn't feel the need to put a moisturizer on right away
side note: i couldn't find my flat foundation brush to apply it
which doesn't happen with other peel off masks
because of the tin man look it gives your face
i always wash my face afterward so as not to encourage any blemishes
which is hard to do sometimes since the drying time is 30 minutes
if you want the mask to peel off more easily
plus when you peel it off
can do before going out for the night without worry of redness
it burns like crazy at first
as you peel the mask away you are left with gorgeous
making me appear greasy
soothed my skin without adding a lot of extra moisture that might have lead to breakouts
wouldn't recommended wearing under full coverage because the serum does feel a little tacky after application
however this may change in the summer when my skin is naturally more oily
no joke, forget every other sun burn remedy.
i find that massaging it into my skin for about a minute is much more effective than just applying it to my face topically
especially in the drier months
once the santa ana's start tearing thru the city in the fall there seems to be almost nothing i can do to keep my face moisturized
in lieu of letting my face simply peel
moisturizers tend to frustrate me because they either sit on top of my skin without absorbing
no matter how dry or flaky my skin gets
or cause my normal facial oil to go way overboard
my skin ends up being oily
it goes on wet, but does not stay damp or greasy.
doesn't burn my skin since i have rocesea.
i love to use this on cold
like the description on the murad site it is actually like giving your skin a nice drink of water as it moisturizes
also seems to help my face retain moisture better
t can calm your skin each time when you use it
i don't even use an eye cream with this.
i will skip days not wearing eyeshadow so that my eyes can have some downtime
my only concern is that in the summer depending on the humidity
the product can feel a little sticky
literally feels like water on your skin.
t's easy to work into the skin
there were just layers of goop on my face that would never settle in
i wouldn't recommend those who get oily throughout the day to put on under makeup because it does cause you to get oiler faster
i feel that it really helped my skin along with my night serum from kiehls
as it can irritate your skin
therefore doesn't give me any long-lasting moisture
as someone who has combination to oily skin
if my skin is dry from weather or traveling
this does not irritate my skin at all.
it feels like my face is going through misters all day
this is my very first review as i never felt the need to review anything until this magical serum cured my dry patches
i tried other high end moisturizers to no avail until this baby zapped my dry flakes away
i put this serum on one of my dry patches that i tend to get during the winter
it has always been impossible to find something to keep me hydrated in the winter without causing breakouts
after i had trouble wearing my usual powder foundation without it drying my
doesn't leave it greasy or sticky
even more irritable because of being more dry
even though i'm typically fairly oily
especially i you find your foundation is very drying
fab's ultra repair face moisturizer over my other products that don't burn horribly
you do have to let it completely dry before applying moisturizer for it to be effective in sealing in moisture on day days
some people might want more moisture
no extra nasty ingredients to irritate the skin
every winter, i suffer from extremely dry skin.
not flakey this past winter
it does wonders as my skin gets super dry
all dry flakiness on my face has gone away
the serum did nothing else than to complete my skin care regime
the finish is a little sticky
i never realized just how much good it was doing to hydrate my skin
very important: u should apply this to wet skin
wait for it to dry befoe putting anything overtop of it
winters are very hard on your skin
i find it a bit sticky
this product along with the other first aid beauty products have not caused me to breakout or made my skin oily
let it completely dry into the skin before i put on the moisturizer
the product is a little sticky
for you extra dry spots
one pump is enough to cover my whole face
the only down side is that it's so water based feeling that it's not the easiest to work into the skin
it takes a little while to really get it worked into the skin for it to dry
not a thick formula at all.
really nice serum for cold weather.
even if i forget to follow it with moisturizer my skin still feels amazing
my makeup wouldnt go on right because of the dry patches
tacky consistency that works best when lightly spread then tapped into your face
it doesn't keep my dryness at bay all day
i hate things that feel like a blob of oil is on my face
really great in the summer or sticky weather.
great for oily skin- hydrates your face so your skin doesn't feel like it needs to produce as many oils
it does leave my skin a little red
i really don't care considering my skin doesn't have any flakes
you put this on after you wash your face
just sucks it into your skin
this soap does not irritate or dry my skin
it's hard finding a product that helps with my dry skin without giving me excema or breaking me out
it doesn't burn my face either
it is a clear gel that goes on a bit sticky at first
after a very cold winter my skin was left dry as the dessert
n once again having to change my skin care routine
soaks in really fast so you dont have to wait to put your moisturizer on
i usually only use this daily when i need extra hydration
i really enjoy using it after a peel or mask
it feels like my skin just sucks up the moisture
it doesn't leave any kind of reside on the surface
i noticed also my skin doesn't get oily throughout the day since using it
my skin was no longer dry
didn't feel dry at all
i wouldn't recommend it for dry skin.
i generally have oily
this product would be good for oily skin.
even though it doesn't completely remove the bags
it kind of stays wet for a little bit
it has really helped combat my dry skin
pat it in until almost dry
it kind of leaves my brissels a bit drying
my face didn't burn while using it
i highly recommend this soap to anyone with severe dry skin like mine
also gets dry in the winter
this is the first product in the line that didn't make me itchy
or leave me with a burning
i would love it if fab would bring out another bar with the red clay in it for those prone to mild breakouts as well
recently i've been feeling like the body wash i use is so fragrant that it might not actually be cleaning as well as i like
what i look for in a soap/wash is something that will not irritate my skin
will not strip my skin
soft that even after using oil my skin gets dry
it didn't seem to fix my dry+sensitive skin in winter
this serum is not oil based which i like because it doesn't leave my face shiny
honestly other products from fresh black tea lines didnt impress me at all
sticky when i just applied
maybe it doesn't work well on mature skin
the one plus for having oily skin
just pat it on your face
i usually have dry skin
not at all sticky
i love skin products with any kind of tea in them
tend to sweat throughout the day
so using an eye cream makes it worse.
setting it all day my eyes did not have any dry patches
i do notice that it feels quite cooling upon application
powder trying to find one that didn't crease or look like an old lady after baking
when you apply the eye area just looks fresh
this cream helps so much in the mornings before we apply makeup
i can physically feel the skin around my eyes tightening after i apply
all you need is a little dab because it does moisturize the area pretty well
i don't really have dry under eyes
so bad that he flakes
don't accidentally get this in your eye because it burns
you'd think eye creams would be formulated as to not burn the eyes
anyway, still i like this eye cream.
i usually wash my face
i find that if i use a thick eye cream
i found that when i don't use this eye cream before my primer
was worried it wouldn't moisturize my eye area like i needed it to
s are even a little bit wet it is actually impossible to open this tube
they get super dry
it doesn't irritate my skin at all
overtime i think it does add moisture to your eye area
let it get cold before application
it didn't give me any of those little white bumps that heavier eye creams can cause
this is just like a drink of water for under your eyes for instant plumping
i will say the packaging does kind of suck because you have to untwist the tip to get the cream out
i no longer have flakey skin
the little extra that may come out isn't a waist as take that
its a nice little cream to carry in your satchel or have with you to use throughout the day
i don't recommend using this product if you have on foundation with a setting powder as it will show every wrinkle under your eyes almost like it melts away your concealer
i only use eye creams when they are free or deluxe samples because i don't feel like shelling out extra cash for a small pot of cream
it does burn when it gets into your eyes or if you get it into your waterline so be precise with your application
there is no moisture though so when the weather gets cold
it does not have an spf which meant that if i was leaving the confort of the shade i had to wear a sunblock
makes your face not so greasy either
it the winter you can usually see my skin peeling off because it's so dry
does not look greasy.
not dry in the slightest
how it doesn't feel thick or oily
just a little dab is enough as it spreads very easily
some days it’ll be as oily as an oil slick
day if i’m more on the dry side: the water cream.
if my eyes are extra dry
i love that it dries down quickly so when i'm in a rush i barely have to wait before applying my concealer
best of all it doesn't migrate so my eyes don't sting or get teary later on
for someone that has pretty normal to dry skin
i never thought about their moisturizer because i thought it would be super oily for my type of skin
it is non-greasy and not at all sticky.
even in humid weather
i would use treatments that ended up just drying out my skin more
seems to be working fanstically is the humid summer weather here
i do wear a little bit of lotion underneath on some days
easy to carry and not greasy at all.
i usually have oily/combination skin
beware if you get in your eyes because it burns
yet oily in parts
i've never cared for moisturizer's with sunscreen because for me it's an added ingredient i don't need
although this cream has spf 30 it is not even a little heavy
it was a little too heavy for my oily
since the essential-c has worked great for me with my oily skin i have decided to stick with it instead of this cream
i expected it to be too thick due to the high spf
it does not make my skin oily looking
my cleanser or because of the winter weather making my skin dry
my skin becauses rather dry
my make up doesn't get cakey when i use this product
it can sting if i get it near my eyes
i like high spf products because i have a few sun spots that i like to protect
it's exactly what your skin needs to counteract the dry/flaky stage of the murad acne system
without the heavy greasy feel that most have
treatments in it so you are more apt to use it because you are not having to apply 5 different serums/creams before getting on with your day
it works wonders- full moisture no mess
is even though it moisturizes well on rare days i get a little dry on my forehead
murad perfecting cream is only one i have found that isn't too oily for my dry/sensitive skin
its not too greasy, its perfect for my skin type.
awesome none greasy perfect for people with oily skin
not for my dry skin like she said
i used it all summer without shine problems
for those that need the extra moisture
not too heavy because my skin can be greasy
in the winter or when my skin is dry
it does have a slight oily finish
i no longer have to use any other type of make-up or creams except some blush
my skin has tendencies to be oily when i wake up
since i have very oily skin the heavy consistency of this cream made me start to break out
not at all greasy
i live in a very dry climate
make my skin itch or break out
i am hoping now for murad to make an intense moisture product that you would smooth on before finishing with the night cream
they sit on the skin
i can just pop it on whenever to feel refreshed
i love this product, but without the pads.
i definitely feel a tingle that lasts for the allotted 10-15 minutes you're suppose to leave on
the ones from when i get too little sleep
you put 3 pumps of cream under your eyes it doesn't need a pad that size to cover
this doesn't replace your eye cream as it is a treatment
so don't skip your eye cream-i'm obsessed with renewing eye cream from this br
and it's got 40 treatment pads in there!!
whatever you call it it smoothed my skin
of course it is nothing like fillers
i just have some fine lines that crop up when my skin gets dehydrated
i am certainly not ready for any sort of needles nor inject-able fillers
i apply this with my fingers so that the product can melt into my skin
let it dry completely.
i used it i see if it would clear some breakouts on my forehead
i suspect the brush is not necessary
didn't cause my skin to break out
i do feel a slight tightening/drying
i did notice that if i apply too much i get flaking
it has a cooling feeling to eat it's not for everyone
the only thing is that my skin is a little dry
gotta love that dry air
forehead wrinkles that seem to show up no matter what primer/foundation/setting powder i use
although it is drying they require you to use a moisturizer afterwards which some reviewers that we're concerned about they dryness should do
i swear you can feel it tingling
it can leave your skin feeling dry so this should be used right before you apply foundation
does help to soften them
i can't stop touching my face it stays soft all day
it got rid of all my dry patches as well
it definitely leaves a film on my skin- which i don't mind
in the summer i have normal skin with an oily t-zone
anyone who spends a modest amount of time outside in subzero temps knows that the cold will basically make your skin
naturally, i had to get the night creme as well.
i mean so dry that the average day cream soaks into my skin before i can even get it rubbed all over my face
the majority of the rich creams make me break out in spots
this cream is exactly the moisture level i need
unless your skin is oily.
i am 48 and have dry skin with fine lines.
yet no greasy feel
or make the oil even worse
i couldn't calm the dryness in my skin to save my life
in search of a good moisturizer which would head off all the little wrinkles that seem to be cropping up every day
i normally look for heavy thick cremes because i get so flaky dry in winter
never got even one dry flaky spot or break out
it's incredible that i am able to use such a rich cream for day without turning into an oily mess
because so many creams do that to me
my skin still feels like i just moisturized when i go to put it on again before bed
as someone who usually has really dry skin
my skin is dry but not anymore.
it does take a few minutes to set into your skin if you apply it without diluting it
it didn't irritate my dry
i can still feel the cream on me
and i have dry skin--the worst kind.
don't forget to use it on those wrinkles that are under your eyes
it doesn't feel sticky after applying
because of its thick consistency i think it just caked under my eyes when applied before make up
does not irritate the eye
because of the consistency you also won't get those little white bumps you usually get eventually with cream formulations
skin because it doesn't add any weight or slickness
it's gentle so you won't experience any peeling side effects
i do agree with some other reviewers that the spray bottle is a bit odd
this helps ensure that my makeup won't cling to my spots or dry patches
if i put it on before i sleep i won't wipe of the excess
just let it absorb into my skin
definitely a lifesaver in the winter when my skin is extra dry
don't bother washing it off
so dry to the point of being flaky
no need extra greesy on my pillow.
this will be amazing when my skin gets more dry during our cold winters
the only reason i gave it 4 out of 5 stars is because my dry sensitive skin could still use a bit richer of a formula
i apply lightly and let it set, then rub it in.
if i get over dry
let it soak in
i can look greasy
my skin is so dry in places
i do not wash this product off at all.
there is oily residue left behind which i don't bother trying to wipe them off completely
i don't even wash it off really
it is what i like in a clay mask
you only need a thin layer to get results.
the glamglow burns a little on my skin when i first apply which i don't even mind
you only need a thin layer so this will last a very long time
so my skin is not red or irritated after using it
this is the first facial wash i have used that doesn't dry my skin out
my skin has a tendency to be a bit on the dryer side
it doesn't over-dry
i don't find it particularly foamy
although it does feel it exfoliates the skin with just a small amount
i typically struggle to find a cleanser that can target my oily skin without drying it out
they were too drying
it's in that season where my skin is oily in the tzone
find it balances out both the dry
i am always super skeptical about face washes.
went to sephora not knowing what to do with my dry skin because it looked dry
not only has it helped get rid of the dry skin
i needed something that would clear out my skin without over drying it
you can use the tinyest amount, get major lather.
my skin care seems to be working better because it doesnt have a layer of dead skin cells to block it
my pores are unclogging which i never thought would happen
my aging skin can get dried out with some products
i notice my skin improving with out being overly dry or tight
not dry at all
doesn't dry out my skin
and doesn't dry me out.
it doesn't strip the skin or dry it out
it's light and not drying but super effective.
you only need a little and it rinses off nice.
it doesn't dry my skin out
the exfolikate used to really irritate my face
i would just use a super moisturizing night cream after to help calm my skin down now i don't have any need for that extra heavy step that my oily skin hates
going from oily to dry depending on the season
it isn't harsh on your skin at all so you can use it daily
refreshed without drying me out like drug store
i love how it cleans but not drying your skin.
over time also helped with my oily skin
i've tried everything for my oily
without my clarisonic depending on how much exfoliation i need at the moment
if you put in the work to use this with a sponge religiously
it does not strip my skin of all its oil
it is never easy finding the right product to balance acneic/dehydrated
fragil skin without harsh ingredients to get the job done
i sometimes forget to moisturize because it's so good at not drying out my combined skin
oily skin in some places
it can also be a bit drying on certain trouble spots
doesn't leave my face dry
only need a small amount to get a great lather
it doesn't dry out my skin
it doesn't make your face feel dry
it foams up just enough but not too much.
doesn't strip your face dry
as soon as i felt the texture i realized that this was not an exfoliator
do you notice your make up peels
with this product you get a seriously gentle
it gets extremely foamy if you use a lot.
you can leave it on longer to get more exfoliation
doesn't burn or sting my sensitive skin
it is very basic, but nice face wash.
it also doesn't dry out my skin
feels like there is slimy residue even when i completely wash it off
this cleanser also doesn't completely strip my skin where it is so dry it is tight
it does wash all of the oil
i recommend this to every skin type i am more normal/combo skin type not too many problems occasional oily t zone
is somehow is still very oily
it doesn't dry your skin
doesn't leave your skin with any dry/rough patches either
it also does not strip my skin completely.
it magically does not dry my skin out
but i can't deal with the dry skin feeling.
do not irritate my skin
it definitely dried my skin out
i really was running as fast as i could after using it to my moisturizer
be extra careful not to get it in your eyes because man oh man it stings
typically anything that works well on my pores dry my face out
the literally sucks the oil right out your skin.
the ingredients make my skin feel great after using it
know the ingredients are getting into my skin
like that of fresh rain or cut grass
it doesn't leave my skin dry either which other products tend to do
i normally have oily skin
not dry or irritated
that one does have a tendency to dry out the face though where this one oddly leaves my face more hydrated
and, it doesn't overly dry out my skin.
it didn't dry out my face at all
i've had no luck in finding a wash that doesn't over-dry my skin
can see it going down the drain as i wash my face
can get very dry
i've heard it can be drying on combo or dry skin types
the first time i used it i could feel it sucking out all of the oil in my face
or whenever i feel i need a bit of "extra" clean for my skin
this is very easy to rinse off without taking any natural skin oils out of your skin
dull skin you need this oil
it can be a little drying for my oily skin
does not leave skin dry or tight
it does dry my face
wasn't taking proper care of my skin so my pores were the size of china
without the over-drying or tight feeling on my skin
this face wash is a must if you have oily
i swear it gently removed all the make up
didn't leave my face dry or red
i feel like it gets all the dirt
you only have to use a little bit to suds your whole face
i feel i have to take extra long to wash this soap off
i may not purchase again because of that feeling like maybe there is residue leftover
otherwise my skin is totally fine with it.
moisturize right after using this cause it can be a bit drying
it does not leave my skin super dry because of my skin type
if you are normal to dry skin it might over dry your skin
because you run it if them before the liquid in the roller ball
needed to heat up the liquid just enough to increase viscocity
without adding straight heat that could compromise the serum
i add a little light josie maran argan oil to this for some extra moisture
i like that it absorbs well instead of some other products that just sit on top of the skin
have always struggled to find a moisturizer that will hydrate without leaving a greasy feel or making me break out
it feels greasy straight out of the jar because it is rather thick
m not sure if it will be suitable for oily skin
does not leave an oily residue
as we get older our skin gets dryer.
i'll add that since i've been using this product i don't seem to need foundation--just a dusting of powder
this product is not greasy at all
replacing my old moisturizer made me realize just how dry my face actually is
you may have trouble with absorption
i can apply a thick layer at night for those days my skin needs a little more love
this face butter when i tried it is so nice.
it is not heavy
it did not leave an oily feel
i live in a dry climate so this moisturizes perfectly without being to heavy or sticky
the area around my nose is always so dry due to me constantly using tissue
i put it on my skin even when i have a bunch of breakouts
you can also put it directly under the eyes without irritation
i recommend this for anybody that has dry patches or just horribly dry skin period
it doesn't make me feel greasy at all
i will occasionally use this if i need an extra burst of moisture
it works amazingly well without irritating or breaking out my sensitive
i do mean *extremely* dry skin
this moisturizer pills like crazy when used over another product no matter how long i let it sink in
no dry spots and no need for powder either.
if my skin needs an extra boost of moisture i will add 1-2 drops of argan oil with this
the best part about this is that it is not heavy or greasy
sometimes i'll add a little bit of argan oil
highly recommend if you have dry skin
if your skin isn't dry then this cream will likely be too heavy for you
it'll feel like it's sitting on your skin instead of soaking into it
to the point where i get flaky skin at times
usually oily on my t-zone
i find that this cream sink in very nicely in my skin
i recommend for dry to normal skin type!
not too heavy on my combo skin
this works perfectly in providing enough moisture with breaking me out
it does make your skin feel a little oily when you apply it
definitely recommend this if you have dry skin
never thought i'd need to put much moisture on my face until my facialist told me i needed to be nourishing it more with some oils
not giving it enough moisture because i thought i had "oily skin"
actually my skin was just trying to makeup for the moisture i never gave it
in winter it delivers a great amount of moisture without feeling think
doesn't feel oily or sticky
my skin decided to start getting really dry
it doesn't leave my skin shiny
not oily at all.
i actually got it for the oils
'll compensate by using a lighter amount in the break out prone areas or an oil free moisturizer
doesn't irritate my skin at all
every other lotion i've tried has always continued to dry it out besides this one
i fell in love with this product i have combination to oily skin
i highly recommend it if you need a thicker face cream
i'll probably get it next winter when the air gets dry
that this would make my oily areas even more oily
i pat some 100% pure argan oil over it at night.
always use a mattifying moisturizer except for in the winter when some parts of my face get very dry
i needed something that would adequately moisturize my skin while making my foundation look flawless
cold weather lately has left my skin so dry
the trick to not getting pilling is to follow the directions
don't rub or use too much
doesn't look or make me feel oily.
i think i may have to add a drop of argan oil to it or use argan oil over it in the winter
by the way i waited to use it when my skin felt super dry
i get dry patches in the colder weather
if i put too much on it feels greasy
my skin does not feel tight after putting it on.
does not leave my skin looking really shiny
basically when the weather is cold/dry
other days i have super oily skin by the end of the day
am careful not to put on too much or else naturally my face will get too oily
mouth got so dry from all the kleenex
am thinking in the winter i might have to layer this with some oil
very dry skin -that it can be so frustrating trying to find the right skincare product for my face
it does not make my skin oily.
requesting a sample of it first to try with your skin since it seems some people's skin had funky reactions to it
using both products does not make your face oily
it gets really comfortable for me when it dries down
helps my drier areas without being too heavy in my oily areas
not realizing it was a mask you wash off
it can break out from being overly dry
so freaking soft compared to the omany other hydrating face masks that i've tried
i do a thin layer and leave it on over night.
let it sit while i wash my body
my skin is so dry that i've compared myself to an alligator before
especially if used as an overnight mask
the usual glamglow thirsty mud wasn't cutting it
i generally have oily/combo skin
many people with oily skin steer away from hydrating products because they fear that more oil will be produced
keeping oily skin well hydrated actually helps lessen oil production because it tricks your skin into thinking it doesn't need it
it gets warm when you first apply it
it kind of heats up a little bit on the skin
you can really feel it pull all that gunk out
this does the trick without burning your face off
definitely helps your skin heal after a break out is done reeking havoc
it doesn't dry out my skin like so many other products do
worked wonders on my severely dry skin
the downside is that you really have to rinse it off or it leaves behind greasy residue
added bonus: if you accidentally taste it while you're rinsing it off
it was hard for me to leave such a sticky product on my face without wanting to wash it off immediately
enough to do the job as a scrub
it has a cirtrusy resurfacing-type feel without irritating or drying out my skin as other products similar to this one typically do
just heavy-duty enough to get all of the dead skin off without irritating my skin
probably the best scrub/mask i have ever used
does not dry my skin out
cannot say that it cleaned my skin deeply though
i start to scrub in circles all over my face before i add warm water
once i add warm water i continue to scrub
this does an amazing job without irritating or drying me out
i probably wouldn't recommend using it more often than that because you might over exfoliate
not having to worry if the products will fall or drip off of my face
i especially enjoy washing it off.
i find that a lot of exgoliators only keep your skin soft for like a day or so
this is definitely sugar your body needs!
whenever i feel like my face has to much texture
an one to many dry patches i use this.
scrub junkie so having this product be both was a bonus
fyi if you put this near your lower nose or upper lip you may get itchy bc of the sugar chunks being near a highly sensitive to feeling area
for someone like me with oily
i rarely actually get pleasure form touching my face
and it doesn't take a lot of water to wash off!!!
so you're not washing your face another 5 times trying to remove them
this is my go-to scrub when i travel
just remember not to "scrub" this around!
the scrub is not harsh at all
a lot of products will burn my face
people who are creeped out by texture might want to put it on with some type of mask applicator
not sticky and it comes off easily with water.
i will say it is more of a scrub than a face mask
although i find it more of a scrub than a mask
love this scrub so much!!
i will say that i use it more as a scrub than a mask
dried it out even more
usually use it after i wash my face
it got very nice ingredients which don't irritate your skin
maybe a little bit too dry
not buying the full size because i don't feel like i would be using this very often since it dries out my skin
doesn't dry out my face like most masks.
it's polishes my skin so well i can get pass the minor weird smell
this stuff is amazine on my skin.
honey are the perfect combination for my normal-dry skin
i would love it if they'd put it in a squeeze tube for hygiene purposes
this mask would be good in the winter or for anyone with dry skin
though it's not going to over a problem for those with oily skin like myself
doesn't over dry my skin.
it does not dry out my skin.
most cleanser that i tried in the past were too harsh or too oily on my face
i would like it to be more of a scrub.
sometimes it can get pretty dry though
i put it on a dry face
but it washes really well.
after 42 years of horrible complicated skin i have finally found the perfect face cleanser
my oily/dry issue is finally resolved
clean when i use it
does not dry out my skin or irritate it
doesn't completely dry out my skin
neither too dry nor filmy
it never drys my skin out or causes break outs.
i actually like washing my face now
it doesn't dry my face.
it does not dry out my skin
i always come back to this face wash
doesn't leave my skin dry
it doesnt dry my face out
when i wash it off
as soon as i rinse it off i feel a difference
i normally have really dry skin.
it didn't make it too dry or too oily.
which is exactly what i need in this humid weather
i only use this in my oily zones
doesn't break out as often
didn't have the burning skin feel nor made my face red
it's a pretty good mask if you can suffer through the initial shock to your nasal passages
to apply to the dry spots this product can leave behind
most masks you usually have to really scrub at to get it off
normally i don't get charcoal masks because they tend to dry my skin out
zero residue feelings like you may get from other products
it didn't dry out my skin at all
it didn't dry out my face
it has not dried out my skin at all
i love the fact that it is easier to wash off
i am not having to scrub face to get the dried on mask off
it doesn't dry hard
it's not drying at all!!
i subtracted 1 star only because it has an unpleasant smell which is not great when it's sitting on your face for 20 minutes
couldn't believe all the impurities it took out of my skin
i couldn't believe how many impurities were brought to the skin
usually all masks irritate unless i make it on my own
wasn't tight or drying
the most annoying thing about my face is the oily areas
still have a super oily tzone
creamy as i feel a mask in the mud family should be
maybe it will help with my oily t-zone.
sometimes i leave it on for more than 20 minutes because i'm too lazy to walk to the bathroom to wash it off
yet my skin still doesn't feel tight nor dry
i don't feel that this is too drying or too harsh
i feel that it does cleanse my skin really well
using it once or twice a week will not dry my skin out too much
i love this product it is good for oily prone skin types it helped my pores remain small
the only charcol face mask that does not dry out my skin
not dry or tight
this is the only charcol face mask that does not give me dry patches
i love charcoal products except can sometimes be very drying
it doesn't dry out your skin at all.
it literally draws everything out without drying me out
i love how it doesn't dry out my skin
skin at the next day feels a lot less greasy
if your skin is dry
i find most charcoal masks to be quite harsh
this one gives a similar result with out drying out my skin
most importantly the way my skin feels when i wash it off
i actually find this helps with my texture a bit too
i didn't realize how much my skin needed the white charcoal too
throughout the day my skin wasn't producing so much oil
i found it to be rather drying for my oily/combo skin
it does go away after it's soaked into the skin
i do get oily on my forehead
tend to get oily as the day progresses
it does have a lingering scent in it that's a little bit stronger than i want it to be
you could even just wear it alone with a touch of finishing powder
serious peeling) and so gentle it did nothing.
worth the results you will love how chloe your skin looks towards our tighten wrinkles slowly reduce love this product also helps with acne i do use it day
i feel like my pores aren't as tight as they were before
when i wake up the texture of my skin is much more even
it doesn't take all the moisture out my extremely dry skin
this product helps control my oily area of my face as well as the dry areas
has really taken my skin from oily/combo to almost normal
is less dry/flaky in the winter
my skin isn't in need of repair
i really wish they'd bring back their old line of skin cleansers
not heavy or sticky
not greasy at all!
all of a sudden i noticed my skin would be really dry after applying my foundation
if i didn't have such dry skin
it really does bring dull skin back to life.
u can just tell your face has just been packed with nutrients
i want to get the moisturizer soft cream to go with it to see if they work well together
does not stick to any dry patches
not at all greasy
its not oily at all
which makes me feel like i am in a deep forest
fairly even skin tone so decided nighttime use was enough
i feel like it really locks in all the moisture
i highly recommend integrating this stuff into your beauty routine because it really just makes your skin look so glowing
have to think that maybe this is clogging my pores?
ts not like there are heavy layers on my skin
the only downfall to it is that it is a bit drying
it is not sticky at all
your skin really does have a glow about it.
does not leave my skin feeling oily or tacky.
combo skin that tends to be on the dry side
dries quick enough to follow with my morning make up
not like all this oily products
i love that it doesn't feel greasy or sticky like so many other serums i've used
i then read a review saying that this in combination with the bareminerals bare haven moisturizer was good
my skin hasn't been as oily as usual
you don't feel oily after.
also dry in the winter
your skin needs it.
it is really soothing on problem dry areas like my elbows
i am someone who cannot stand chapped lips.
it gets the job done of giving your lips
or wherever else you put the salve moisture
i don't use it as a moisturizer because i find the texture to be too thick
t tends to rub off if you eat or drink after applying it
it can be applied anywhere moisture is needed.
it's hard to keep it moisturized because i live in a cold snowy dry area
you can use this salve anywhere on your body
and don't even get me started on my cuticles!!
isn't as sticky as vaseline would be
it really melts down when you apply it
considering how thick it is in the pot it really thins out when you apply it
my skin had a dewy look without looking too oily in the summer
i found though that it was even better for things like dry skin at my elbows
i deal with some seriously dry skin
this does not break me out or make me feel oily or heavy
i still use this on my face as a hydrator
normally i'm skeptical of oils because the tend to make my skin dryer
i get extremely oily throughout the day
my skin became less oily throughout the day
i didn't feel that it did much for my dry skin
i never thought adding oil to my skincare routine would make my face less oily
it's a must for the pacific northwest winter when my skin couldn't feel any dryer
while being super dry
i really like it to use for very dry
other than that my skin can get dry
i already feel moisture coming back to my skin
my skin gets so dry in the winter
it just wasn't doing the trick in terms of moisture anymore
i almost never use oils- they usually feel heavy on skin
don't even sink into my dry patches
i don't usually use oils because they either break out my skin
or they don't absorb when i have dry skin
anywhere i might get a dry patch on my arms
it soaks in well so that you don't look or feel "oily"
this stuff works wonders on dry skin
i like this oil a lot
it does feel greasy going on
applying this under my foundation doesn't make my skin any more oily
i did really like using this on my elbows
regardless if i used a good primer or not my eyeshadows still looked a pit patchy
this somehow helps keeping it less oily in the long run
i'll use it right out of the shower
doesn't leave my skin greasy
did not leave any greasy residue
s can get pretty dry
immediately thought it'd be great for my elbows
i don't have dry skin
so the ends of my elbows are the only place on my body that get dry
had to be careful not to spill it before i got it on my elbows
as if they'd never been dry or flaky at all
so i'd recommend giving it some time to soak!
the sunshine oil i really wanted to try
irritate or break it out
doesn't dry-out my face like the old cream used too
perhaps with oily skin who would benefit more from the face mist more than this oil
i would recommend the sunshine oil over either one
hair tends to hold scent better than anything
if milk's sunshine oil doesn't clash with your perfume then i imagine it would work great in hair
it doesn't drip or run all over
it took care of my dry winter skin.
it doesn't leave an oil slick behind when applied
omg i've only been using the hydrating oil stick for a few weeks
let me say that i didn't have high hopes for the hydrating oil stick
it's basically just condensed oil you rub onto your skin
since i tend to have a very oily t zone
with my combo skin i rarely find a product i like that does not break me out or leave my skin feeling greasy in some spots
the weather has been rather warm
it is very simple to use because i just use the stick to rub it all over my face
there bad for my skin
i do recommend for dry or even oily girls out there
now that my skin is dry enough to require an oil
i am not sure how this would work on oilier skin
as i have dry skin
if your skin is on the dry side
you could wear this on your own for a dewy look if you have dry skin
it can be used anywhere on the body for dry skin.
i also love that the container doesn't get that gross oily feeling that i thought it would
kind of wait for it to absorb it will leave a little bit of "tightness" until reapplication
your bf's dry knuckles or something lol
know the dry skin is on its way
gives you an easy way to apply a little bit of moisture anywherefor those seeking an easy to use facial oil that’s mess-free
i found this to e extremely convenient to just rub on dry patches or skin
i live in a super dry climate
i can get dry patches throughout the day
it does sink into my skin a little while after massaging it in
i wasn't sure if it would be hydrating enough or if it would only make my oily skin look shiner
i can even get away with just this as my moisturizer
does not leave your skin oily or sticky.
finally a product that i can stick on top of my blush/highlighter that gives an extra glow without making a huge mess
i just hope it won't completely melt on hot days because this is going to stay on me at all times
the best part is it doesn't leave your skin shiny or oily
it literally feels like water on the skin
no cake or dry face.
you getting less oily
it makes my make up stick, its so light
looks dry most of the time
i keep it in the fridge to get that extra cooling effect as i find it helps de-puff my eyes faster
which is a hard thing to come across without using super oily products on my skin
on hot days it really refreshes everyone.
i don't refrigerate either because i don't like things that are too cold
it is a little bit sticky
it does make you feel better when the weather is really hot
it feels so cold once you apply to your skin.
will now be my after wax go to
i definitely recommend this to anyone looking to get rid of puffy eyes
it felt cool when applied
the stick applicator makes it really easy to put all over my face without having to dip my fingers into a pot or dirty them with serums
doesn't take a lot to give the the cooking sensation as it says
did not leave my skin feeling greasy or oily at all
others get quite oily
didn't make my oiler areas greasy at all
i can keep it in my carryon bag
i tried using it under my eyes to see if it would get rid of my bags or puffiness
its good to use when its hot out to cool off
it won't give you a cooling sensation for the rest of the day
feels even better after you've been out in the heat for awhile
its just kind of to refresh your face.
gives me some moisture without being greasy
i do not like putting this all over my face because there is a slight sticky feeling that comes with it
it really does have that cooling sensation
the smell is like gross cheese or something it goes away for the most part after a few minutes
especially when you put it in a cold place before applying it
it does leave your skin a little sticky
even not in the fridge it still has a cooling sensation
not only does it help with puffiness if helps me get out of bed
sometimes i put it on once i remove my makeup just for that cool soft feeling
the only downside is it didn't help with my dry skin
i would highly recommend throwing this little guy in the fridge
you may get the same outcome by freezing some spoons
i don't keep it in the fridge
cool except the cooling only lasts about 10 seconds
it gives you that extra pinch of moisture when you feel like your skin is a tad on the dry side
it doesn't dry you out
the cooling effect basically is for if your face is hot
give good moisture to the face in a convenient stick i love
i put mine in my freezer to make the cool even more intense :
i don't rub or pat it into the skin
this product feels cold when you apply it
that's made the cooling water feel amazing
alone as a way to refresh your skin its amazing
she had a problem with her makeup melting off when she was sweating
as well as a touch up stick from dryness from blowing my nose or even on the rest of my body as my h
s as well get dry
it even works really well on your lips
i can't notice it changing my face or pores in any way
i love how it feels cold on the skin
this is a must for hot weather
i only really smell it in the first 5-10 minutes of applying it though
i would reccomend it to people with dry skin like me
i get very oily throughout the day
just an average face lotion that will not clog your pores or make you break-out
the only reason why i didn't give it 5 stars was i felt it left my skin a tiny bit dry
i don't have oily skin
doesn't dry my skin out
i highly recommend this if you have oily
perfect for oily skin or those bothersome t-zone areas
it also doesn't make my face dry out even more or get really oily
it doesn't make your skin any less oily
t's hard to find a lotion that doesn't worsen that during the day
it has given me moisture without causing my skin to be overly greasy or having any new blemishes appear
my oily skin looks like you can scrape oil off it by the end of the day
their use of good ingredients that don't irritate or inflame my skin
i don't have oily skin
although if you like using oils
pretty sure i'm on bottle 6 or 7.
i never had the problem of it being more oily on my oily skin
night even in my t-zone not only does it leave my skin smooth
i love that it doesn't make my skin oily
i mean my skin is super oily that you can see the shine glowing
usually when put make up on i get oily right away
so my skin doesn't flake or peel like it usually does with other products
they would dry my skin out
i do not think that it is for only people with oily skin because it hydrates my awful
not very heavy for my oily face can wear it pm
i don't feel like my skin becomes any oilier because of it
in the winter i do get some dry patches
everything gave me breakouts because they were all too thick
found that it's a great moisturizer to help manage through the extreme dryness that you get while taking this medication
it doesn't really control oil
the lotion is light so did not feel greasy at all
my face isn't dry
if my skin is dry i'll add a drop or two of oil
tend to be oily in the summer
i should mention that i have oily skin
they either dry my skin out
i found that my skin was getting extremely oily throughout the day
my face definitely doesn't get as oily when i'm using this
there because you have oily skin…try this
it may seem quite oily when first applying
my make up never looks greasy with this underneath
not crazy oily like before
fresh like i just applied it
is not sticky or makes me feel oily
when ever i need extra hydration i would mix 2 drops of my clarins lotus oil with it
am always trying to dry out my oily spots
would recommend this product to anyone with oily skin during the day
my skin gets super oily during the day which seems to be part of the reason for most of my breakouts
they didn't wow me on products for oily skin
expecting to find something better for my very oily skin
not too thick, or greasy.
doesn't make my skin worse
it does not feel oily in the summer
not rich or too heavy
then a slightly denser moisturizer on the rest of my skin because some of the products i use can be a little drying
this combined with josie maran argan oil light has done wonders for clearing up my skin
it never feels heavy or greasy
most are a little bit drying
it may not be mattifying like the oil-free mattifier
doesnt make the oily parts greasy or anyhing at all
especially in the drier winter months
it also doesn't make me feel greasy in the morning
it really is good, it does control the oily skin.
the feeling of any moisturizer even oil-free just feels so gross
my skin would be to the point where the majority of it would be flaking off
i would've been too embarrassed to leave my house because of how bad my skin would flake
i don't have any problem with my skin flaking anymore
not greasy or heavy at all
it's hard to tell if that's due to me sweating more as the weather warms up or if it's related to trying a new face wash as well
this moisturizer works pretty well under makeup if you give it about 10 minutes to fully absorb
i find that once i start to get warm or oily later in the day that this doesn't do a very good job of controlling oil at that point
although i've yet to find a moisturizer that really does a good job of that under makeup
doesn't cause my skin too dry
it doesn't leave your skin greasy
since i don't really need extra moisture under my face masks
it does more than water
if you're just looking to add a little more moisture/ dewiness after you wash your face i think it works great
this stuff works really well with mud masks.
my masks wash off so easily now!
even though i just used a clay mask
masks do work better if you tone first than if you just throw them on immediately after washing your face
i feel like you could spritz this on whenever
not to mention i don't have to rub my face raw to get drying masks off anymore
it made the mask dry faster which made the mask pull anything out better
that mask never dry down
those of us with dry/sensitive skin will be able to tell that this does help keep skin hydrated while using masks that would usually dry or irritate or skin
struggling with oily skin has forced me to pay more attention when my face is dehydrated
these masks can really dry even my super oily skin
it only takes a couple spritzes so the bottle is going to last a very long time
it really does help your masks sink in deeper
oil from your face
it takes longer to dry than water
i really did feel like my masks stuck to my skin more
even the drying mask feels good with this !
after using it with a mud mask i really love it
it didn't affect the drying time of my mask
i always use this mask
this cleanser doesn't leave my skin feeling tight or dry after using--anyone who has combination to dry skin should use this
tarte uses such good for you ingredients that i never have to worry
doesnt dry out my sensitive areas
normally i face gets red when i wash it
it's acceptable for all skin types especially dry skin
i feel like if you have extremely dry skin all over then this would be drying for you
my face no longer feels like an oil slick
i highly recommend it because my skin becomes immediately smoother after one wash
this makes me less oily throughout the day without completely drying out my skin
glowy without leaving a greasy residue over my skin which is one of the main things i like about it
i just didn't feel like it was cleaning deep enough
it does take a little longer to rinse off than a regular foaming face wash
does leave your skin baby
i rebought another face wash that totally dried out my skin
they either dried out my skin or made it tight
my only gripe is its overwhelming sudsy nature causing my skin to become dry
even though i have oily skin
works even better with my sonicare brush because of the gel consistency
not a cream because those are just too heavy
my skin isn't over producing oil anymore throughout the day
the only odd thing i find about this product is it makes my skin feel dry afterwards
it doesn't dry out your skin.
only need 3 small pumps to get a really good lather
you don't feel over dry after using.
doesn't break me out or irritate my skin in any way
had issues with my skin getting too dry or oily
and doesn't leave my face dry at all!
with different products either felt to dry or to oily
it never dried my skin out or made it dull
my skin do not become dry.
once i rinse it off my face feels so soft
yet gentle enough i use it twice a day to clean my face
it definitely eliminates the just out of the shower raccoon eyes without leaving your face dry or irritated
even greasy in certain areas of my face
this product gets all my mascara off with very little effort
this does not burn or irritate my skin in anyway
it is not drying
one of the best cleansers that i had used to remove make-up however it does dry put my skin
i personally don't find it to be drying
didn't dry me out
doesn't strip the face or leave it feeling tight or dry
this works very well for just cleaning without adding oil or residue or drying
it helps with bringing some moisture back in my face
i apply it with the tarte pink scrubbie it really helps with getting the cleanser deeper in your skin
does not dry out your skin at all
my skin is usually very oily with some dry patches
this cleanser makes my face feel less oily without drying out my dry patches even more
this is thee best face wash i've used.
it takes off all my make at the end of the day without drying out my skin
also doesn't leave my skin oily.
usually do about 2 pumps on the sephora rubber pink thing
if you suffer from oily problematic skin
the only thing is it does dry out your face a little
not only did it cleanse my face
good cleansers usually dry out my skin leaving it flakey
it has been so gentle on my face that it hasn't dried out
also being gentle enough on my dry areas
i also love it because it gets every bit of leftover makeup off without irritating my skin
i don't need quite this much moisture
i could imagine that anyone with drier skin would absolutely love this
other face washes i have used either do not remove all of my make up or cause my face to feel dry
i wasn't sure it effectively cleaned because i didn't feel squeaky clean which is unusual compared to others i have used
it doesn't dry my skin
it washed off easily and i didn't feel dried out.
too many chemicals for my liking
it feels like an oil when you massage it on dry skin
as soon as you add water
have tried many different cleansing oils that feel too thick
it makes me wash my face more often before bed!
doesn't leave my dry skin tight
although this product may go on feeling super oily
love that it does not leave a heavy residue on my face
this oil is so light
if i applied a lot, i usually double cleanse.
so relaxing and doesn't feel too oily.
does not burn when it gets in my eyes
i still follow up with another cleanser to make sure my skin is squeaky clean
it keeps my oily skin at bay for quite some time
requires a moisturizer in my drier areas because it strips away so much oil
if i don't use my clarisonic than i thin it out a little with water
probably will need something a little more moisturizing as it gets colder though
it does feel different after some called it sticky
it does leave that squeaky clean feeling afterwards so dry skinned gals might not dig it as much as i do
so just a heads up if you have dry skin.
my face doesn't get greasy through the day
don't be scared off by comments about it being drying or skin feeling tight
you only need a little bit of the cleanser to get a really rich lather
it does leave that sticky
it goes away in a minute especially if you use a toner to make sure there's no residue
my skin doesn't feel dry at all.
oily t zone with some dry patches
this wash is somehow balancing for me
it foams up a lot which i really like
it's not over drying either!
not drying or irritating at all
i feel like it helps to stop my breakouts from spreading if not clearing them completely
i could still see makeup coming off when i used a toner
it lathers good if you add a little water
t's hard for me to find an acne-fighting cleanser that doesn't either dry out my skin or make it red
using this cleanser once a day would probably be better for you if you want to avoid drying your skin out
i feel like you need a good dime drop to really get a satisfaction from a foaming wash
this has just the right amount of treatment in it where it doesnt leave my skin flaky
which is great for my oily areas
light weight yet moist enought.
doesn't leave the skin feeling sticky like some gels can
it may not be enough moisture for skin that isn't normal to oily
most moisturizers leave my skin feeling so oily that i typically just settle with dry feeling
as the lotions tend to sit on the top of our skin rather than absorb
my skin is never greasy or oily after using this product
especially if you have oily or combo skin
i tend to get a little flaky in the winter
is lightweight enough that i'll use it through the warmer weather
then this moisturizer as the air became less dry
it is not sticky at all so no worry about the stickiness
looked up reviews for this one for normal to dry skin
doesn't make me feel like a grease ball
the moisture is out of this world without getting oily
if my skin was drier
i wish i wouldn't have to dip my fingers or find an alternative to grab the product without feeling like bacteria is going inside
just the right balance-- not too heavy
doesnt make me any oily-er
not making my skin more oily or greasy at all
i think it helps improve my super dry skin.
this is amazing if you have dry skin.
feels the exact same at the age delay moisture starts out creamy
one of the ladies recommended me to get this if i like bare minerals
this is something to get if you are struggling with dry skin
i can feel it absorbing quickly into my skin
i deal with dry skin and this works wonders.
stay extremely dried out
the lady that sold me this bare minerals said its more age appropriate for my skin
when i use this product for the first time my skin just absorb it because it was so dry
this new deep drench mosturizer does the trick without being greasy
i live in a dry desert climate
my skin is so dry that i get little bumps
for the times my skin is oily i only apply a small amount
my skin gets super flaky once i apply make up
with lots of flaky dry patches that look horrible no matter what make up i use to try
not just a few dry patches
i would 1000% recommend this to those with very dry skin
not greasy or anything.
it is also very soft cream that can be very easily spread over skin
even though this only has spf 15 it still does a great job protecting me from the sun's rays
chin would get flaky abd with makeup it made my face look awful
i've always had oily skin throughout my whole life
must have for dry skin
other skins do not compare to my mum's she cannot wash her face with anything even if it is organic
this has helped my skin so much while on accutane
is less oily than before i started using this oil
a few days ago i thought about adding it into my foundation because i like a bit more of a runny/lighter foundation
it's almost like water, but oily.
at first i was just using at night because i thought it would make my skin too oily under makeup
just use a little of this oil
doesn't make me extra oily
i am usually a person who skimps on moisturizer or primer or other products meant to prep you
even with the oil base my mascara doesn't run when i do add it
the face wash was making my skin even more dry than it naturally is
dry skin everywhere else
i only use it in my night time routine so makeup or any other product/pollution doesn't disturb it
it gets really annoying to find a moisturizer that doesn't make my nose more oily
if i'm not doing scrub
feels light almost don't feel anything compared to tarte oil
does my skin justice especially since it's winter time
i wouldn't use this during the day if you are oily
don't let the "oil" scare you if you have oily skin--this balances my skin out perfectly
necessity for me as i always have a hard time finding products that soothe my parched skin in the dry months
it'd probably be too oily to use in the summer
i can also see it could be too greasy for anyone with oily skin
this product never left my skin feeling really oily or gross
only down side is i have pretty oily skin
love the non greasy finish even though it is an oil
hands down best ever for dry aging skin.
i don't have anymore texture hyper pigmentation seems to be going away
all you need is just a few drops with your moisture
i don't get the greasy cake face
you don't need to soak your face in this oil overnight
can feel a little heavy
it's good to use when your skin is needing that extra boost
this oil is making it so much lighter
this oil absorbs very quickly so your face doesn't feel oily
i never look or feel greasy even though i have combination skin
other than my skin being completely addicted to this oil
live where it is always humid
moisturized without being heavy like other oils tend to do
it didn't dry greasy
i did not have goodexperience with oils
not only is the jar pretty
i even use it under foundation occasionally when i'm going a more dewy look
although drier in the winter
no greasy residue that takes hours to go away.
all you need is a few drops on your skin before bed
but during the day i have no oily skin issues.
as soon as it's all rubbed into your skin
however there are matte powder finishes if that's not your preferred look
my skin tends to be on the drier side
oils traditionally break me break out
i break out from any type of oils
not even oily anymore
then i tried this: non greasy
when used really sparingly
you can't even close the containers all the way.
it does what it says it will you get hydration for the delicate under eye
this is not your normal eye cream
immediately you'll feel a tightening sensation which is nice
it is pretty close to impossible for me to find a moisturizer that doesn't break me out
now that i'm getting into my late 30s i was finding it wasn't enough moisture for me
i will get this again when my other face creams run out
does not cause for my skin to be oily
i would love this cream even more if it came in a squeeze tube or a bottle with a pump
thought it would not be right for my dry skin
is a bit oilier in the summer
more oily than dry
doesn't feel sticky on the face
my skin doesn't feel sticky or tacky at all once i give it a minute or so to dry
would recommend for oily skin :)
i do find this to be a little pricey- i used philosophy's take a deep breath moisturizer for years
if you're oily to normal, this is a good option.
i mean really dry.
i never liked wearing moisturizer because it always seemed to make my combo/oily skin even more oily
spray some setting spray on the rest of my skin to control any grease that may try to sneak up throughout the day
in the summertime was noticing that my heavier moisturizers seemed like they were just sitting on top of my skin all day in the summer humidity
although i am dry
it doesn't cause any acne or make me oily either!
i normally get so greasy
i did find it doesn't spread as nicely as my usual moisturizer
it didn't leave any kind of greasy or tacky residue
however, my skin gets kind of dry after using it.
everything i've ever used either breaks me out or dries my skin out even more
i tend to have very dry patches on my skin
when drying it can get a little tacky
i will forever keep this in my skin routine.
it can leave a bit of a shine after
sometimes i even apply my fave oils either under or over top
the moisturizer does kind of burn when i first put it on after washing my face
if you are dry or combination
i don't feel dry throughout the day
usually it's normal to dry.
it does not leve any greasy residue.
it is not oily
my t-zone is dry and scaly and the rest is oily.
honestly nothing helps my face when i have rough patches or after i wash it like this
it goes so far for just a small dab.
i literally makes your face feel like it drank a cup of water
it's a treat for my dry skin.
before i used it my skin was so dry
doesn't break me out or irritate my skin
literally feels like water on the skin
the best way to describe it is like your skin drank a glass of water
my skin during the winter is usually very dry
this made my skin never dry during the winter
i always use this after i was my face for some moisture boost
i actually find that it keeps my oily zones in control
this works well for oily or dry skin
my skin was so dry i couldn't hardly wear makeup anymore
like it looked like i was getting over a bad sunburn
and its not oily so it doesnt make you break out.
this has gotten rid of my dry patches
i don't notice my tease zone as oily
how well it works with my oily skin
or when my skin is really dry
for the first time ever i found a moisturizer that actually not only suits my very oily skin
makes it less oily
no matter what i used i was left with flaky skin
can get really dry in the winter
i find sometimes that i come home covered in grease
i barely need to powder really
i noticed my skin starting to feel really really dry
t's a struggle to find a good moisturizer that won't break me out
i didn't find it drying at all
its formula doesn't leave you feeling sticky
although it feels sticky for about 10 minutes afterwards that goes away so this is a pretty good moisturizer as long as you aren't in a rush
it doesn't make my face feel oily after applying
you have to remember to apply an eye cream first so that it doesn't tug at your skin
eye masks under the sun breaking my budget in the process because i thought if i got the really expensive stuff i would actually eliminate my problem faster
i'd have to learn how to do proper draining massaging besides my regiment or get some kind of gadget to help things along
i just rinse it off for the next use.
by taking care of your skin
i recommend if you have dry or crapey under eyes.
i love how once you use water to remove the oil
maybe put some cling wrap or something under the pump
because it will leak a little
this is the only face wash that helps my super dry skin
i am very dry to the point where my face peels
suggest it to anyone with super dry skin
because it is a very nice cleansing oil
then add some water to it
not oily, not dry, but normal and perfect!
it also didn't do much for me in the way of reducing dryness or making my skin feel less dull
doesn't make it greasy like some other oils
if it doesn't hydrate enough, i get too dry.
not irritate or dry my skin
it is easy to wash off
you can wash your face with this
i will suggest that if you are prone to oily skin
then you could use a gentle face wash after
this does not burn my eyes
it gets all my make up off without drying out my face
i like to use about 3-5 pumps for my whole face
this just seemed to melt everything off
use more like 8 pumps to get all my make up off
it comes right off my face with this cleansing oil
i usually rub it into my dry skin
you must use warm water for this to work!
doesn't leave skin overly oily or overly dry
i typically have dry skin
this does not dry it out
it does not feel super oily either.
i would recommend this in conjunction with a night oil / treatment to anyone with dry/dull looking skin
especially if you have problems with your foundation clinging to dry patches
however you need to use it with a cloth or dry wipe
have a flawless skin you need to either wash your face with a good soapy cleanser or you just need to use a warm cloth
you can't never put straight water on it is oil the warm cloth will do its work
or you can use a make up wipe before hand.
i like the idea of adding moisture to my skin rather than washing it away
i don't know if i will repurchase if i can find a cleansing oil that actually cleanses
i do t feel like i have a layer of oil on my face after
perfect for dry cold weather when your skin needs a boost
as a night cream for me it gives great moisture for the night
it took a few times for me to get the right amount of product where my face wasn't greasy or not enough moisturizer
i also like how this came with a little spatula so you don't have to touch the cream directly in the jar
i love that this cream comes with a little stick to help get it out of the jar
i don't have to dig under my nails
can already see my sun
my foundation goes on smoothly without any dry patches when i use this moisturizer
it does help my skin to repair itself afterwards
i know that the bottle does not mention spreading the cream around the neck
even with out a make up primer this helps my make up go on smoother
is not greasy at all
the look of my skin looks kind of plump because its no longer dry
even though its summer my skin is in need of moisture
let me start out saying i have dry skin
a lot of time when using tubs of cream that you have to use your fingers to scoop out
it is thick and i prefer to only use at night.
due to sometimes having oily skin i've only been using it at night
it is the only cream i've been able to use with my combination skin that isn't greasy feeling
is just a little too heavy for my skin type
i find it very hard to get the hidratation my dry spots need
not getting to oily on my t zone
i just needed something to soothe it
the cream is heavy but not greasy.
cream moisturizers can be a struggle for me because they never feel as if they dry down completely
don't last any longer than other creams
feel the change in the moisture level of my skin
plus it really moisturizes the skin so you'll notice less dry spots
s which always look so dry
it leaves the perfect amount of moisture while not feeling greasy
in the winter i think i'll need additional moisture on top of this
ever sticky even with super humid weather
in the winter i think i'll need additional moisture on top of this
i sometimes use to get a few dry patches that showed through my foundation
isn't oily or greasy or leaves my skin feeling that way
my skin drank it in very nicely leaving a matte finish rather than oily
i do feel like my skin is more moisture.
when i started using it last fall it didn't seem to do anything except make my oily skin oilier
it feels as though my skin is drinking it in.
i wear these while i do my make up or while i'm cleaning my house
these gel patches feel great when i'm wearing them
they weren't "wet" from serum at all
they are so soothing
how many patches your getting
that's cheaper than most if not all eye patches.
there's enough serum that i've used a bit extra after i used the patches
i like that they come with a spatula to lift them out
the only thing is that if they're too damp
they make great eyeshadow shields if you tuck them in far enough
can easily migrate into your morning routine
rehydrates the under eye like you wouldn't believe
so this helps more product get onto each patch
how quickly they sink into the skin
ptr eyes masks do not break me out
was just drying me out
my under-eye area gets really dry in the summer because of allergies
other active ingredients on the rest of my face that i don't want to rub around my eye area
i will never use another eye cream.
it doesn't burn my eyes if it gets too close to them
i learned that there aren't pores on this area of your skin
nice thick cream that i use during the day.
i could not put any makeup or eyeshadow on without my eyes looking like a crusty messi went into my local sephora
no more dry skin
this product did not burn or sting at all
i don't have dry undereyes
does not leave a flaky residue because it does not absorb into my skin
i don't know if they are actually fading or the gel just creates a brightening effect
very lightweight, but you can feel the moisture.
as with any moisture products- to allow a little time to soak in before applying your makeup
not at all greasy
i will need something with a bit more moisture for drier winter months
i don't usually use eye creams/ gels because frankly they have never done anything noticeable
didn't burn or irritate my sensitive skin
they tend to feel too greasy
my skin literally feels like it just had a facial ever time i use it
this is the only mask i have ever used that does not dry out my skin
it almost feels like you're wearing a sheet mask cause it's so cooling
you definitely need to use a brush to apply it
once you scoop some out it's like the consistency of honey
after these midwestern ice storms my skin comes out feeling dry
it does what it clam for.
not greasy or gross feeling
i initially tried this just to add some extra hydration when my skin is dry
tingly sensation that continues even after you take it off
then after i take it off i cannot stop touching my skin because it is just softer
considering it doesn't dry like a clay mask would
if you love hydrating masks them this one is a must
it kinda tingled on my skin upon application in my problem areas bc i had irritated them with my exfoliant before applying the mask when i took a shower
because i really don't like masks that drip
it gave my face the perfect amount of moisture that it's been really needing
it doesn't feel harsh or dry you out at all.
when i normally use a mask
i get the most compliments because it makes my skin look pore-less
doesn't sit on top of my skin for too long
because i know my skin is drinking it up
especially during winter for those with dry skin like me
i do get all crazy trying to get rid of blackheads
it is totally cleared up my acne scars if not breaking out or anything while using this
then i realized that shiseido is working magically on my skin without any breakouts
this is for the darkspot on your face caused by acné or sun
i will try to use it as a serum alone when i finish my current serumi love the smell
i wouldn't recommend wearing this on its own because it will make you look greasy instead of glowy
this gives me enough moisturization to last me through the day
it's suitable to use it in summer for dry skin
it was not that much better than the clinique take the day off or even boscia makeup melter
i like that you can use with sans water
just apply then wipe off your make up with a towel or cleansing pads
it can also diminish my pores because i can clearly see my pores are pulling out by the balm
leaving barely any residue on my towel when i dry my face
you have to put it on on dry skin that has make up
so you can imagine my delight when i applied a tiny bit of this balm to my face
i hate products that leave my skin feeling dry or irritated
it doesn't irritate mine it makes my skin feel so fresh
it makes me skin feel clogged instead of clean after using it
you will end up with baby soft
i like that when you wet it
i would get dry patches around if i rub it too hard
this product didn't make me brake out or dry out my skin
not burning my skin or drying it out
i didn't even need to use a wash cloth
so much so that i don't feel the need to use oils or night cream
nothing was there when i used my toner with a cotton pad afterwards
no need to worry about size since it's not liquid
not where it left my face feeling oily or sticky
the combo-dry skin doesn't show any dryness throughout the day with it on
i don't like apply a thick layer since that makes may face being sticky
my sister's is more dry
smooth even when i am not wearing it
i'll be interested to see if it retains it's hydrating effects with the change of season to winter where the air in our home is especially dry
it does get dry in the winter as our home is primarily heated by a wood burning stove
it soaks in quickly so my face isn't sticky when i try to go to sleep
i would perhaps use something different if my skin were drier
this is a really good overnight mask for combo/oily skin
i usually put coconut oil when my skin is this dry
does not feel oily at all
not heavy cream or greasy
it got super dry
it feels like you just melted all of your troubles away
there is only one thing need to mention that it's a little bit too nutritive to absorb for me
i don't tend to put a lot on because it has a wet feel
s--doesn't leave you "greasy"
make sure your face isn't dripping water when trying to rub this on otherwise it won't stick well
does not leave skin dry at all.
i continue to use it every day because it doesn't dry me out like other cleansing bars i have tried
finally a soap that doesn't make my face itchy
what is nice about this one is that it does not leave your face tight or dry after rinsing
otherwise it can make you look greasy
i feel like its best to use as a moisturizer for when youre staying home rather than wearing it under or mixed with makeup
i would especially recommend this product to a friend that suffers from dry skin as a moisturizer only not a primer or to mix with foundation seeing because it makes you super oily
if your skin runs dry
you will still probably want to apply your usual moisturizer underneath
my skin is typically dry
i’m gonna have to save it for the wintertime because my face is less oily during that season
it doesn’t work well when my face tends to become oily a lot
great after a shower/washing your face since it's a little thick to apply
the only thing i had an "issue" with was if i used it before i washed my face if it was oily
loved how this product absorbed quickly into my skin without making me look extra oily
this does have a slight shimmer so you can definitely wear it alone
t didn't feel too heavy on my skin
i would recommend to anyone looking to hydrate their skin while maintaining that summer glow year round
touch ups while tube has liquid portion for when you're actually giving yourself or a client a makeover
it is a bit dry and i just don't reach for it.
you just need to dab it on
as it's hard to rub on without using a ton of it
i do feel that if i wear the cream on its own it's a little to glowy
plush feeling to your skin before you start adding on other products
the only reason i gave it a 4 was the fact that the flip top cap product was not very pigmented
leaves no residue... does everything it says.
it was a little too shiny for my taste to put all over my face
i think it absorbed pretty well into my skin.
even though i have oily skin i was still able to use it as a moisturizer
it didn't make my face oily either because it felt very light on my skin
easy to apply leaving your skin looking
it may last longer if you don't have oily skin
if you are in hurry only this product with setting powder can make your face look bright
you can use this product for an everyday dewy glow or a night on the town
will say that it stuck to my skin a little
which made me believe it works better for oily skin
it doesn't leave my face dry or oily.
i love that it doesn't have a "shine" to it like other liquid products
if your face is looking dull
as i was deciding weather to put on a natural make-up look or just a quick fix me up
i didn't want it to make me look too oily or greasy
if you put it everywhere you might look a little greasy because it definitely is hydrating
the highlighter is so concentrated than you only need a little bit
it won't make you oily
it does have a slight sticky feel.
it tends to make me a little bit oily even though i have dry skin
would be better suited for someone who is a bit tanner
normally i look a little dry
feel weightless which is a lot coming from someone who is acne prone
this has a lot of shimmer almost like a highlighting primer you can use over your whole face
which i actually appreciate as it warms up my skin
i mix it with my face cream so this tube will last forever
i get tons of compliments on my skin now!
if i could bathe in this product i would
this really is great alone or mixed into a bb cream or your foundation
i also use it as a highlighter when i'm in a hurry
i don't like a lot of highlighters because they tend to be too bright
i live in texas where the humidity can make you shiny without products
when i saw how perfect the glow was--not too much--i prayed the heat wouldn't ruin it
t might not be that great for people with oily skin
it is much harder to overdo this than it is with the skin perfectors
i would wear it over foundation as wearing it by itself had a tendency to break my skin out
it doesn't go on heavy or greasy
it has a very tacky consistency which is quite pleasant especially in the mornings before applying makeup
i think this cleanser would be appropriate for normal to dry
not just dry skin
i keep it in the shower with my clarisonic brush.
does not burn my eyes!
there's nothing that will ever get rid of those except a good concealer
this did not irritate my skin at all
it does absorb into the skin well though.
it kind of leaves a slightly sticky feeling—not enough to really bother me
immediately needed a new face cream for my combo/dry skin
the only cream i've tried that is sufficiently moisturising for my dry skin
i would recommend this to anyone with dry skin.
my t-zone gets oily throughout the day
sometimes the rest of my face becomes so dry it flakes
s from producing oil causing your skin to become really dry
i knew my old moisturizer wouldn't be enough to combat it
it's a ticker cream so to me i feel like that helps actually lock the hydration in instead of having it sit on top of my face
i would often struggle with getting shiny or even more oily after putting a moisturizer on
this doesn't happen with this rose cream
without making it shiny or oily
my skin is so dry for any one product alone
this cream is one of the only products that doesn't leave my face oily
i only needed a little bit to cover my entire face
nonetheless i highly recommend this if you have dry skin
it gives my face just the right amount of moisture
most would leave my skin too oily
if ever in life i had to use another moisturizer my skin would probably fall off of my face
doesn't break my skin out at all
i already had dry skin in florida so needless to say it was time for a major moisturizer upgrade
without being heavy or greasy
experience dry patches if i try to stop using it
i apply a liberal amount because it feel a bit drying if you use a little
it find that it doesn't feel dry
my make up would look awful on my skin cause it was so dehydrated
if you're having issue with your make up not lat ting due to dry skin
add this to your skin care routine
it doesn't make your face oily
during the winter months it dries out really bad
there are some dryer spots
it more so feels like dry or matte almost primer like
if i'm unable to find one i might just have to bare with the smell because it is a great moisturizer
gave my skin just enough moisture
it never gets oily through out the day
highly recommend if you have dry skin
not greasy or heavy.
like most people can get a bit dry during the winter
if you use the correct amount is not greasy
during the winter my skin breaks out because it's dry
it doesn't make my skin oily
you just can't rub it in too much or it will ball up on your skin
it doesn't leave my oily skin feeling clogged or more oily like some moisturizers do
not greasy at all
and it moisture your face very well.
my skin can get so dry to the point where it itches
my t zone is always very oily
it didn't make my skin feel greasy or leave a film
this was a bit too oily for my t-zone
i find that when i wake up my skin is smooth
light enough for your day cream
once i put it on my face my skin absorbs it so fast it's so soothing
whenever i use this product my skin definitely feels quenched
hated the way they dried so quick they never felt hydrating enough
all in all it's a great product to try if you have dry skin
i don't believe its great for oily skin
this is the only cream that suits me
i tend to have very dry skin on my face
this doesn't provide moisture for a full 24 hours for me
oily skin try this because it might fit you perfectly
the weather is really dry now
is not oily on the face at all
tends to be a little dry in the water
to maintain the effects however i can't even skip one day of skin routine
my skin tends to get dry here
not at all greasy
they didn't touch my dry skin which would still flake under makeup
didn't make my face oily at all
doesn't get too greasy in greasy places
i would apply my usual powder make up
it does not leave any sticky or greasy feeling on the skin
it doesn't feel greasy or heavy at all.
my face is very dry most of the time
i needed a hydrating cream for day/night that would not make my skin greasy or bother delicate skin areas
i do not get super oily from it either.
this is the only moisturizer that has allowed me to go all day without my dry patches flaking up under my makeup
this stuff is truly amazing even compared to the more expensive under eye creams i've tried
i used it overnight nor do i mind thick night time skin care products
did not feel any burning sensation.
gives the right amount of hydration especially for us oily people
it did its job to keep my combination skin
do not rub the gel into your face.
for whatever reason it is more hydrating when you pat the product in
this is especially good for summer when you might not need as much moisture
as an oily girl i still use this in the winter
just seems to absorb right into the skin
i don't find it has a super sticky or tacky residue either
bordering on shine if you have oily skin or put too much on
that is enough moisture for me
where parts would be oily
areas i know are a bit drier
i let that soak into my skin for 10 minutes
i feel like i'm not getting as much moisture as i should with this product
my face would be done dry
my skin isn't as dry
my skin tends to need a lot of moisture both in the morning
it would dry out your skin
it does however have amazing amazing ability to deliver water under your skins surface
i will sometimes use it before a face mask to really help the moisture penetrate the lower levels
happy to find a product for him to treat his skin
it does leave my face sticky :-/
my nose used to be extremely oily an hour after applying my foundation
mix this with their oil skin never looked nicer
i will say that this is more for oily or normal skin
when it gets oily
like i need at least 3 sheets of oil paper to get it back to a normal look
i don't know that those with dry skin will like this because it doesn't really feel as though it's providing intense moisture like a cream would
it’s hard enough to find a good “in between” product like this to pack on more hydration to the skin
in the past i've been hesitant to use a moisturizer in the morning because i felt like my skin would break out from the moisturizer then make up
honestly its great to mix with the clique gel if i need a bit more moisture
it does apply sticky
if you are on the oily side
this stuff is like a drink of water.
they had a tendency to feel sticky on my face
it feels like a cool drink of water when you apply it
although i need a cream too
or felt like heavy
it feels like my skin is drinking a tall glass of water on a hot day
finding myself less oily by the end of the day
inside there is a cylinder bottle so that whole thing is not actually filled with product
drying out too much
it is light to not feel sticky
surprisingly it works even it the dry cold weather
i personally have combo/dry skin
spend time rubbing extra product into my areas more prone to dryness
i wouldn't recommend it on it's own for drier skin types as it's more serum-like
i found this winter was making my skin crazy dry
if my skin needs tlc i apply it before the marula oil at night
first off let me say if you have dry skin don't let the name fool you this is not a magical product that's going to get rid of that super harsh winter skin this would be something to add in to your skincare routine to help hydrate that bottom layer your regular heavy night creams can't
as someone who is oily combo i feel like my skin has oil on the top layer
i can tell as soon as i'm done applying them my skin is going to be super oily before i even lay down to go to sleep or by the time i'm done getting dressed
i mix a pump of this in with about 5 drops of jojoba oil right after i wash my face at night/morning
it may just not be enough to combat the dryer
this may prove to be a holy grail for oily summer skin
if i have extra dryness i use the maraula oil.
it can't really be used as a moisturizer unless you have truly oily skin
or getting too oily
unless you have oily skin
i would maybe use this as my sole moisturizer on greasy hot summer days
my skin isn't producing excess oil to over-compensate for being dehydrated
not so much flaky dry as
here's why:-works well with other skin care
apply that in the dry patches i sometimes get in the winter time on top of the b gel
it somehow keeps my oily skin in check
have the perfect combo for my morning skin without feeling greasy or heavy
it is enough to cover my entire face
not oily at all
or even if you have oily/combination skin like i do during the winter
the b hydra is a great moisturizer for those looking to hydrate their skin without feeling too piled up
i think those w oily skin can get away with using just this
also gotta love de's non-toxic skin care philosophy
doesn't leave my skin greasy
gives you moisture without being heavy at all
really dry people this might not work for bc it might not be enough moisture
after cleansing my face no matter what i use my skin feel dry
once it does absorb
or dry patch s this probably isn't it
as soon as i wash my face it's very dry
more oily in the t-zone in the summer
i'd say it's combination with more dry than oily spots
i get the really flakey patches on my face in the winter
doesn't leave residue on your face
it is not sticky nor does it leave my face feeling matte
i do use a beauty oil before putting this on due to how dry my skin gets
my make up doesn't look crusty
no matter what other moisturized i've tried
really hydrates my combination skin without breaking me out or making me greasy
you only need a small dab of the product to get all the benefits
doesn't feel thick at all with its gel formula
the title says it all about this product: it really does give your skin a deep breath from all the toxins we take in from our surroundings
doesn't need look or feel oily
normal skin everywhere else so this moisturizer helps me wake up in the morning without feeling greasy
without feeling glue-y as so many non-oil-based products can feel
no greasy feel leftover
it doesn't make my skin oily
this really let's your skin breath and relax.
when the lady put it on me i feel in love it with makes my face feelso soft take thes red out
i will for sure be continuing this as it does not over moisturize
sometimes it is a bit sticky
not greasy in the slightest.
i can't stop touching my face because it just feels so soft
my skin is combination-oily with most oily zones in the t zone area
blue version of take a deep breath that i couldn't find on sephora anymore
you can smell it on your h
s until you wash them
i may be on the hunt for a new moisturizer because i can see the sweet smell being overwhelming when it is warmer out
was hard to find in skin care
realize my skin feels like a cool breeze is just blowing through it
you can feel it foaming
does not leave the skin dry
my skin is on fire sometimes
this doesn't aggravate it
i actually use it in the shower.
not overly dried out
it does burn a little when i leave it on
the mask would foam within a minute or two so when i'd rinse off there wouldn't be a difference
didn't dry out my skin
fresh without feeling dry like some clay masks do
have yet to find a deep cleanser or mask that doesn't burn
rubbed like i normally do
affective facewash to use a few times a week for an extra deep clean
i won't buy it again as i usually use the boscia black cleanser which is amazing
it can get a little messy
probably not the best for super dry skin due to the kaolin clay unless you're feeling congested that day
then you add water
really gets my face clean without stripping it of moisture
i usually take 2-3 good pumps
watch it foam up then melt everything off my face
the only negative part is that it does make me a bit oily
the only thing to remember is that you still need to moisturize your eyes when using this
the big misconception is that people expect it to be for moisture
i see or feel no residue
before or after, you also need moisture!
however it is more effective as an eye mask bc it is super drying on the eyes
some people claim to see flakiness
sephora's roll-on gel is useless because it does not really depuff
start to pill once you put any other product on your skin
most say this product is drying or leaves a weird film
it sort of goes a dry white
too bad i'm not sure if it works as a treatment because makes skin feel kinda dry
no pilling and very happy so far!
this is hard to apply like a lotion because of its watery consistency
is not heavy or sticky
is that if you have dry skin
not at all oily or greasy
or not enough moisture
would recommend this if you have dry skin or want to cut out a step in your skin care
soft as it usually does
i like to simplify my morning beauty routine when the weather gets warmer
i knocked one star off because it would be impossible to use in the summer since the humidity makes my skin extra oily
great for dry to normal skin types
i feel that just soaks up the product which is such a waste
i finally found out that its meant to smooth your skin
clean yet not stripped of moisture once i apply this
would advise you use it with a cotton pad
apply it on your skin that way as i don't think this is meant to be a lotion
it comes out like water
it does not make my face oily
i do apply argan oil over it, though.
doesn't conflict with my oily skin at all
anyway i put this stuff on with damp h
s for an easier application it drys kinda fast so be mindful of how you apply over your face
honestly worth the price because everything i use usually makes me oily or dry
you don't feel oily at all after using it.
don't know if they are smaller or if the improved skintone hides them
it lasts forever because you only need a couple drops to cover face
as it gets cold
which is amazing because usually when i wake up it just has a nice oil slick because my skin is usually oily
wanting to avoid your make up looking cakey by the end of the day
i would however not become d for dry skin.
someone with dry skin might not do as well with it
i get absolutely no creasing from my makeup around my mouth anymore
my favorite part is that it hydrates my skin without making it feel greasy or sticky
don't have any peeling
know that my skin will still get a good clean
the tackiness of the product because whatever you put on top of it will draw further into your skin
they'd given us expensive creams with dangerous side effects that didn't actually work
it does feel a little sticky when you first apply it
almost every product i try irritates my skin.
however i have oily skin
once this is dry
then apply this on your skin let it dry.
it's not meant to be rubbed in your face.
you pat it into your face.
the only problem with this serum is that they put a glitter in it
at least it isn't some nasty fragrance that they put in after the fact
doesn't leave my skin sticky
less now that weather is not so cold
i no longer have dry patches at the end of the day like i used to
i also suffer fatigue from late nights so needless to say my skin can look really tired
i always try to drink lots of water which can make a huge difference in my skin
you can feel it tighten your skin as well
i now feel like i can wear full coverage foundation without it looking cakey
limited quantity(you snooze, you lose)
i feel as if i am feeding my skin
the other great thing about this elixir is it can be worn during the day under makeup without creating oil buildup or additional texture
if you apply liquid soap to a dry sponge what is it going to do?
it doesn't dry out my dry areas
it's not a big deal since cleansers don't stay on your face for too long
i get cleanser squirting everywhere when i am not careful with my daily first pump
the first few times i used it my skin got a cooling feeling
now i think my skins is used to it
i will say you get a lot of product for the money however the bottle is slippery in the shower when you try to pump
pump however i feel like the pump
for a fairly expensive face wash i'd expect easy pumping especially since even most drug store washes have that feature down
i only need one pump to wash
apply moisturizer right after as it does feel a tad bit drying on my face
because i'm not sure my skin needs much brightening
i love this face wash so much.
you only need a small amount to cleanse the entire face
it makes my skin feel extreamly clean instead of feeling like there is a layer of soap still on my skin like some face washes do
more into my skin care routine
leaves my skin fresh and does not dry out.
it doesn't burn when you wash your face
you can feel it working so definitely avoid eyes or open skin
be very careful when using with wet h
can leave some residue if too much is used
could say this: the eye cream in this kit is the same size as the eye cream alone
i also use it on my clients when doing makeup if they're a little puffy under the eye
if you are sensitive to smells you better not use facial products
i just thought it was doing ok on my mostly oily/combination skin
i just needing some moisture in my dry areas
found it to be much too greasy for my oily/combination skin
i hate moisturizers in general because everything feels too thick
for a water cream i feel that this can be a little heavy for daytime use
the humidity this time of year makes literally anything feel heavy on the skin
it doesn't feel heavy or greasy.
since this cream is water-based it doesn't cause my skin to get too oily
as someone with oily skin
water creams are a good in between because they are not heavy or thick
as someone with combination/oily skin
my skin is so dry that it can even look flakey.
if you hate the dry feeling of tight skin these are two great combinations
it made me face look oily when i already have oily skin
doesn't make my skin feel greasy at all
i would recommend this to anyone with combo oily like myself or even someone with oily skin just because of how light it is while being really moisturising
i learned this the hard way by using products that stripped my skin of all oils
i would lather it all over my skin if it came in a 1 lb tub-need i say more?
like it feels so light because it's a water cream
it is honestly the best product i've ever tried to lighten discoloration on my face
not at all greasy
oily every where else
potentially normal skin types in more warmer/humid climates/months
it doesn't make my skin any oiler
does not feel greasy or leave any residue
i tend to have an oily t-zone
a nice light moisturizer that does pretty well under makeup if you let it sit for a few minutes
they don't actually feel like a drink of water for your skin
may not work for those with oily skin.
i find this cream gentle enough to use every night
need something super calming afterwards
now if you have really really dry skin you may want to layer an oil under or over this cream
most moisturizers makes me breakout a tiny bit after using them for a few days
anything with "moisture" was not my friend leaving me to use serums
buildable if you need an extra layer for super-dry skin
i find this a good balance of moisture without making me oily
if you only need moisture
now if i could just find the perfect mineral spf
i put this on before or after juno whenever i feel my skin is dry
i personally have oily skin sometimes
i see a lot of people saying this caused more break outs or oily skin?
i always always always wash my face before putting this cream on
it's going to do that a little until your skin absorbs it all
with no oily or heavy feeling
hooked on it who has really dry skin
no more dry patches anymore
then apply this cream when my skin is still slightly damp
where the oily parts are super oily
the dry parts are super dull
it can get a little heavy in the summer
maybe my skin just needed extra moisture bc the winter air has been doing a havoc on my skin
not oily or drying like other creams can be under make up for 18 hour days
i feel like it is not quite hydrating enough for nighttime use
i did also notice compliments about my skin happening more often after using this moisturizer
luckily it doesn't linger
doesn't make me feel oily
it also plumps up my skin where i want it to.
it does have a little burning sensation sometimes when first put it on
the texture is just everything you could expect from a watery cream
i wouldn't probably use it as my only source of moisture
lots of really wonderful hydrating products do tend to break me out
i am 49 and have norm/oily skin.
the lady said it would be perfect for my dry skin type
i would consider this a "of winter" combo skin product as far as moisture goes
not greasy or heavy at all
yet tend to get dry patches here
because it provides enough moisture while leaving a perfect primed finish for makeup application
not too thick and greasy.
it also has a wonderfully citrus smell that dissipates once you put it on your skin
as this is meant for dry skin
doesn't feel clogged up like most moisturizers with spf usually do
its not sticky like some.
t didn'the feel greasy to me
doesn't leave me feeling gross or oily by the end of the day
i get the spf built in so one less layer to put on
does not leave my skin oily at all it leaves my skin with a glow like if i had makeup on which is awesome
i feel like this product gave my skin just enough moisture
my complexion is combination dry with oily t zone
it does not dry out my skin
most products just dry out my skin
it is now a staple in my skin care routine
drying like many other products i have tried
it is slightly drying for me
couldn't believe that i was having breakouts with my thin drying skin
not enough to dry my skin
for sure clears up breakouts when i used it as a spot treatment
really helped clear my skin without drying it out
maybe some dry areas while the rest of your is fairly oily
it also feels amazing on your skin- it isn't heavy or greasy
i'll definitely be making this a skin care routine staple
i guess you can use it as a spot treatment for a really sore spot
i over-did it a little bit immediately after i did a chemical peel
you could lightly scratch my face
it goes on smoothly without irritating the skin
when i try to use them my skin breaks out
i dry sensitive skin i tend to stay away from products such as this
due to very fine lines on my forehead i want to start using more products for anti-aging
not drying at all
any little thing that touches my face will disturb my skin
good for oily skin types because it's adding water
some days i feel extra oily
sometimes other moisturizers are just too thick for 3-digit weather
it doesn't feel heavy or turn oily
my skin was so dry that it was scaling
feels so light yet somehow it's moistures the skin to an extreme
when you start to rub it between your fingers or on the face
did not make my skin feel heavy
the texture can be a little tricky to get used to at first
on my more dry days i would just mix it with my josie maran argan milk treatment
the water-based formula makes it feel like it's going on like air
doesn't aggravate my sensitive skin or make me break out
made my dry skin look amazing especially after a few days
it is not a thick or greasy formula.
i think that it is better than the tacha water cream
when you start to rub it into your skin it really does feel like you're rubbing water on your skin
won't irritate dry or broken out skin
nothing "water drop" about it.
it's like gel when you squeeze it out of the tube
when you spread it
great product for warmer weather
enough oil on my forehead that i could deep fry something
allows the moisture to stay in your kind
doesn't feel heavy/greasy like other moisturizers tend to feel like
this didnt make me more oily
it is almost like splashing water on your face
it does not leave a weird silicone feel either.
it feels like water when u touch the gel
i am mix skin it doesn't feel too oil or too dry on my skin
also doesn't weight my skin down for so long
my face is always so dry
it does have a watery feel to it
i felt it almost vanish off my skin before i could even massage it
doesn't make my skin dry or oily
some days i have really oily skin
some days my skin is so dry it feels cracked
they either made me extra oily or dried me up even more
as someone with very dry skin
you can imagine how complicated my skincare routine is day
it really does feel like a drop of water on your face
however if you have dry skin
this year it got so bad it started flaking in a few areas
the dry winter air does a number on my skin
the best moisture i have even tried
dry areas before they even start
it's also nice to wear in the morning before applying makeup as it doesn't get oily or sticky on your skin
needless to say it's hard to find even moisturizers that don't irritate or break out my skin from being too heavy or having the wrong ingredients
it's just the amount of moisture i need
very oily currently so don't need a lot
once you put it on your face it absorbs like water
e the product in your fingers then apply it to your face
instead dot the amount of product on your finger then apply it to your face
if my skin is feeling extra dry due to living in the north i turn to my origins drink up intensive over night mask
that doesn't cause break outs while keeping my skin from looking dull
it feels like a water drop as you go to spread it on your face
didn't find it drying at all
it really does help my skin on these really cold days
i cannot use to heavy/thick of a moisturizer because it will just sit on my face
doesn't make my face more oily
when you put it on it gives a cooling sensation
i actually used this when my face was extremely dry to the point it was peeling
it's hard for me to find products that are actually good at providing moisture for me
don't overlook this if you have lackluster normal skin
i feel like if this isn't ample moisture for people
wouldn't use this if my skin was going through a rough patch
i love how it hydrates dry areas while not being greasy or heavy
not limited to a drier skin type
its honesty not gonna do much as a moisturizer for dry skin
once you put it on it actually felt like just rubbing water on your face
this doesn't give enough moisture on it's own
turns almost the consistency of water when you touch it to your face
it may be enough of a moisturizer when the air isn't so dry
my skin would not stop peeling for a while especially around this winter time
if you're not using a serum to give your skin that deeper level of treatment
no moisturizer alone with ever be "enough" for you
it's hydrating yet not one of those that'll leave your skin almost too dewy
it soaks right in-no waiting around for your face to dry after washing it in the morning
it dries out a little in the winter
doesn't make my skin oily in the slightest
smooth after using it too
just like a drink of water for my face.
my skin is so dry in the winter it hurts.
does seem to evaporate pretty quickly so you have to use a lot especially due the winter-y lack of humidity
i find that the oil traps the moisture on my face alot longer
my skin feels like it has the right amount of moisture after using this product
doesn't make my face feel sticky or oily.
so much that it would flake under my foundation throughout the day
it actually tingled on my skin the first couple times i used it because my skin was so dry
there is no more tingle unless i'm having another dry day
it was great on my skin all day it didn't feel heavy or sticky
feels super thick but drys to nothing i love it
it doesn't make my skin look greasy like the argan milk does
i live in a very cold-dry climate
it goes on so lightly
it would be great for oily skin types.
it doesn't make me oily.
thought it would get worst by hydrating
using this helped so much with my dry patches
with combo/oily skin i was scared to use it
my face is also less oily throughout the day
which is an added plus for someone with oily skin
i don't have that tightness in my skin anymore
yet really keeps moisture in
when i wake up in the morning my skin doesn't feel tight or dry like it used to with my old serum
people just say, "your skin is beautiful."
broken capillaries are now so few that i am not even bothered by them much anymore
otherwise the last several pumps will be an oily mess
the best part is that it doesn't irritate my skin at all
however i do get dry patches now
yet this treatment oil does not leave my face greasy
sunscreen without it feeling too loaded
changing over to the korean skin care routine helped me be confident of my skin without foundation etc
i also like to use it on the days i exfoliate as the extra moisture can help my skin recover
it does not make my face oily
most facial oils will either end up an oil slick on my face or will make me break out
at first i was a little skeptical about putting an oil on my face because my skin can be naturally oily sometimes
i found that when i apply the sk-ii facial treatment oil it actually does not leave my skin feeling oily or overly greasy
i found that i did get just a bit greasier than i might have before
i can feel the difference in my skin's moisture throughout the next day
more dry as i am getting older
anytime you add foundation over dry skin it's not a pretty picture
my sensitive skin is still struggling to find an spf it doesn't react to
this product not only restore the moisture back to you skin
replenish plumpness by adding must needed oils back to your skin without hammering it
not shiny or oily at all
especially the comfort my dry skin feels immediately after applying the sk-ii facial treatment oil is something i never felt before
didn't make my face greasy
doesn't leave it looking oily
leave you looking like an oil slick
this oil is dry.
i worried that applying an oil to my face would make it greasy
i sometimes break out or my skin gets irritated
just make sure to shake it up so the ingredients combine
the skii facial treatment oil was a bit of a mystery to me- what is it supposed to do?
it's not a "your face is covered in oil" teenager look
my skin would get oily during the day
recommend especially for those that crave intense moisture on their face
this product does not irritate my skin at all.
i guess that product is more for oily skin.
f your skin is on the drier side
i always had a slightly oily t-zone, but no more.
the thought of putting oil on my face wasn't exactly appealing to someone who used to have to blot her t-zone or use blotting powder
cheeks needed something to moisturize them i gave it a try with an open mind
it goes on so smoothly, but not greasy.
your skin just doesn't have that smooth
this product however was not messy or greasy.
honestly when i received the sk-ii facial treatment oil in the mail i thought it was going to make my face look greasy
it was not greasy at all
i let the oil soak in for a few minutes then apply my liquid foundation right on top
to the point that my skin will sometimes flake in certain areas
this oil definitely helped with the dry skin on my face
i only used this product at night after cleansing because it made my skin look a little oily
was scared it would make my skin like an oil slick
it is rich when you shake it up
are typically oily especially in the summer while the rest of my skin is dry
i can apply it a little heavier on days when my skin is extra thirsty without turning my face into an oil slick
not enough to irritate my skin
i look forward to using it in winter in particular when my skin is very dry
nothing works to eliminate dryness like this does
to keep me looking dewy fresh even in may
when i wake up my skin is no longer oily looking
the product did not clog my pores or make me breakout
it comes in a glass bottle with a perfect dispenser for only getting out as much as you want
normal-dry on the rest of my face
it didn't irritate my skin at all
i oil is not greasy at all
since using this face oil my skin looks so young
with the use of this product every night i didn't even notice a peel
the dryness in my skin is going away
most oils are and make me break out.
when you use it, shake it to mix the ingredients.
once on i don't get the shiny look on my face
as i'm not fond of putting oil on my combination skin
it does not leave me shiny or oily looking.
this has not broke me out or cause me any irritations
highly recommend for anyone with dry skin or who just wants glowy skin
my face is usually still wet/oily when i go to bed
it doesn't leave any mess on my bed or pillow
when i wake up it is completely dry
yes your face is covered in oil
it makes my face so soft and not oily at all.
air exposure is not a good thing when it comes to creams
most people think that this oil absorbs quickly
the coconut oil side felt less greasy than the other
when choosing a skin care product i always look for moisture
there's still parts of my face that are naturally oily
create extra dryness just in case the oil was too much
i already notice that my skin isn't as dry as it usually is
by my fourth day i felt like i didn't even need as much because my skin was more hydrated
i would recommend it if you have issues with dry skin
chapped areas i had as a result of winter weather
i only need to use about 4 drops to cover my whole face
this is going to be my new go to product for wintertime when i get dry irritated skin
i would still have dry patches
being fearful of getting greasy i only used 2.
not greasy at all
i only wish there was an spf in it because i dislike layering products on my face
'll get onto the treatment oil
it's the best oil treatment out there
warm climate all year
a must have for dry / normal skin!
doesn't make my face all oily
i put some of this cream on
once applied this stuff was sucked up by my skin making it feel extremely smooth
my skin is extra dry in the winter
so happy to have found a solution to my dry skin.
i could feel my skin suck up the moisture
i'll start off by saying i have very dry skin that constantly needs any type of hydration
it sinks right in giving my face so much hydration
would sometimes peel or roll off of my skin when i tried to apply foundation
i am in the t+zone super oily, rest dry.
keeps my t zone from looking like a oil slick
i wish there was a body version cause i want to bathe in it
because i'd rather touch up than have dry patches
now that the humidity of summer is upon us
if your skin could drink water
will try serum now because of how much i love the sleeping pack
ton for my dry
i know some people use sleeping mask as night cream so maybe that's why it's not hydrating enough for them?
clinique's moisture surge overnight mask does an even better job
it does not feel sticky at all
if you are dry
this has been perfect for the florida summer months where i need a lightweight feeling moisturizer that's still powerful enough to replace what my skin loses from all the sweating
i recommend for anyone who has dry skin!
my skin does not get irritated by the product either
it doesn't leave you feeling sticky it smoothed out all the fine lines for sure
i recommend it for dry skin
best of all, it didn't feel sticky or greasy.
good for lazy days when i just want to "wash
once you get a hang of the pump mechanism it's all good
allow it to sink in when you pat it in properly
too early for resultsi do love that this has a bit of shimmer
you can actually feel it firm your lids.
i used this after getting sunburned really bad
i did add some extra lotion to keep the skin moist because i felt like it wasn't enough moisture
it does feel a little sticky at first
i ever mix it with my moisturizer at night when my face is inflamed
i dont really have puffy eyes however there is a nice cooling effect
without having to worry about creasing or product build up
i just rub this on
i do give it plenty of time to soak in
it gets really dry to the point of flaking
i made the mistake of using an eye cream that had mineral oil in it
cooling while not sticky or greasy at all
the stick is dry
tacky enough to pull on the delicate undereye skin if you just swipe it on
it helps so much in the morning when i need to get rid of my puffiness
during fall/winter my skin gets very dry
definitely shouldn't replace your eye cream
when applying make sure you have the product in towards your nose
overall it works for me so anyone with oily puffy tired eyes will love this if you can spend the extra cash
my skin is not dry at all
it's not moisture enough for keep the good feel
i usually do not like eye creams because they are too rich
i also put in the fridge for more cooling
not greasy or heavy at all
f you don't push the balm up enough you will scratch your skin which with the eye area is terrible
the cooling sensation alone will make me keep using it
as someone prone to milia this was perfect for me
it is not as good as my usual eye cream
beware of not applying too much
guess that why they refer to it as a soothing fluid
oily skin types may find this to be enough on its own
this product is gentle enough to not cause any breakouts or leave me greasy upon waking up
did not feel like it's clogging my pours overnight
as soon as you put it on your skin feels super soft
it drys instantly so no need to really worry about it getting on sheets etc
not sure if it's too little sleep or dehydration or what
i keep in the fridge to make it a bit colder
once you let it soak in for 10 or 15 min
recently it is so dry that there are a lot of flakes on my skin
every time i apply mask or toner my skin will feel painful because it is so dehydrated
i feel it does hydrating my face although i still have flakes on skin
it can get mildly sticky when you first put it on so give it a a little time to sink in before bed if you don't like that sticky feeling against your pillow
it's gotten rid of my dry patches overnight
especially in the winter time when my skin is so dry
in combination with the jelly mask my skin doesn't get that dry anymore
it doesn't leave any form of residue except for a smooth feel
being in my mid 30s with dry/normal skin
i will sometimes leave this on as a mask
i found this face wash to be very drying
i just follow up with some coconut oil
that no matter how well i lathered up in the shower
unlike most charcoal products it doesn't leave a grey residue in my shower
did not make my skin itch / dry out.
some products over dry it
this doesn't over dry
usually soap doesn't really make a difference in my skin
i can also tell where the oily spots on my back are
my face because i get a lot of breakage there
i don't find it too black in the bottom of my white tub
i didn't get that waxy squeaky skin feeling that you can get from some bar soaps
my skin felt a little bit dry when using this in the winter
it does not feel drying
this product is my holly grail right now all girls with oil skin should used it
feeling oily not to far into the day
it can leave a tight
i agree that it is too drying for the face
this bar doesn't dry my skin out
t might be a little drying for others
though it is a bit drying
i teach hot yoga + practice often- this soap takes care of any break outs that i can get on my back area from sweaty sports bras
doesn't seem to be drying so far
i find it dries out my skin a little bit too much for daily use
i even use it to wash my face as i shower
does the job without drying
there is no need to rinse after using it.
the mask does not over-dry my skin at all
i love how it does it's job without stripping my skin of moisture
oily no matter what treatments i try
you just need to mind where your splashing water
i would suggest you not have any light clothing or use light towels as the mask may stain some items
it isnt overly drying out my skin at all
keep in mind guys that this is a mask that has sulfur sooo with that being said
if you spray a little of that on first the mask will spread easier
my skin did not feel dry or tight either.
my face was so dry all winter
not at all greasy
if my skin is extra dry
once on the skin it absolutely will not flake or ball up
it's like an all-in-one product that someone with normal to oily skin can probably use as their moisturizer
probably won't be repurchasing seeing as i haven't much luck with illuminating moisturizers
i usually have some dry skin
perfect for summer if you don't want too much grease on your face with some moisturizers
that could be due to me adding my mineral powder
plus, who can resist a little extra glow?
doesn't feel like it leaves a layer on your skin
there is a huge sheen when you use the product
put it on with moisturizer before my foundation or even if i don't
at the end of the day i'm not overly greasy like i usually am
while its shimmery when you squirt it out it definitely doesn't translate to your skin that way
this product helps with my dry patches without making my oily spots oiler
then as it dries it starts to feel pleasantly warm
i enjoy using face masks when my face needs a pick-me-up or just to de-stress
it did dry my skin out a bit after
the paste is so thick that a little goes a long way
amazing as a full mask or just a spot treatment
this mask did some wonders on my skin
with this product i did noticed less oily spots on my t zone of the face
this is a soothing oil that sinks in really well.
it doesn't leave you greasy
i reach for this product every time i have sun damage on my face or a bad allergic reaction
i don't typically spend too much on skin care
once you put it on it does not feel heavy nor does it leave a white screen on your skin like other sunscreens
i dont normally get burned because of my olive skin
it would be ok if it were for someone with dry skin or normal skin
my usual moisturizer is the moisture surge extended thirst relief by clinique which i really love
i would not recommend for dry skin
not heavy for oily/combo skin with a lot of good ingredients
when i rinsed it off i couldn't believe one application could do so much
i find it extremely refreshing in the shower.
you just want to have a slightly diluted version of it on your skin for 20 or 30 seconds away
you may be watering it down too much
therefore you can spray your face
it doesn't dry out my face
let the rest air dry
this is really gently on me
i wouldn't use it in the shower- definitely do the sink application
wait for my face to dry completely
i apply it on my face with wet h
as it can leak through the cup you make with your h
i do feel more glow like with the help of this cream
the weather is drier
it would be great for a drier climate
it does take some time for it to completely absorb into my skin
my friends with more oily skin may not like the heavier feeling of this cream
when i apply it i never feel dry or tight all day
i could tell my skim felt firmer
you do need to warm up the cream a little between your fingertips before you apply
not greasy oily or any film type of feeling.
i don't know if that was due to heat from ups truck
or if it's just because of humidity
i feel like putting it in the fridge
on days that you feel like you need more moisturizer you select two little balls
if you are normal skin
i just wont use it before make up because of the greasy residue
one bead was not enough to cover my whole face
it doesn't go on evenly
i would definitely recommend this sticky
this primer does not make my skin feel oily or greasy
my makeup did fade just a little around my really dry patches
you must make sure your face is really damp
do not rub it in
i found it goes on just fine on its own if you just warm it a bit between your fingers
i tend to get oily towards the middle of the day
let those products soak into my face
you have to make sure to *pat* in upward motions on your face as this is a very tacky/sticky product
if you try to put this on your face as you would a normal lotion
you'll feel your skin tighten
mouth where it usually does
this is amazing if you have textured/pore-like skin or if you have that annoying laugh line creasing that baking just doesn't do enough
i love how this stuff takes care of my lack of hydration in my skin
you smooth it out on your face
gives back your skin that you had when you were a baby
this helps to keep my makeup stay put in florida heat
i then wait about 5 minutes to let soak in to skin then i go with my makeup application
i don't personally feel a lifting effect with the skin
does not feel sticky or heavy on skin
acts like a vacuum to keep your make up on
my skin usually gets oily towards the middle of the day so normally my make up would not last all day
dryness all at the same time
when the product drys that feeling is gone
you won't feel awkward pulling this out of your cabinets if you're a grown woman
suggest for the winter for people with dry skin
it will make your skin look tighter.
healthy rather than oily
i would suggest using a nice powder in the t-zone to finish the look
cheap or expensive due to my dry yet oily skin
i usually only have to oil blot once
because of the thick consistency yes it will take a while for your skin to absorb all that product
and remember to tap it don't rub it.
to dry or too thick
my makeup stays fresh looking all day it does not settle in lines
will definitely be making the switch to tackier primers like this one
it's able to really fill in my pores to nothing without that silicone-y feeling
i actually really like the jelly consistency
seeing as how i have really really dry skin
i do still see a couple of dry patches
after applying it made my face feel wet.
when you touch it with your fingers it just feels tacky
when you pat it in the stickiness goes away
my tzone is not oily anymore
it doesn't leave you too shiny or greasy like some moisturizers will do
it is a clear gel with a considerably sticky consistency that i suppose helps to grab the makeup
otherwise it'll feel like you're trying to spread glue on your face
doesn't get greasy or oily (dry to normal skin).
it's a little difficult to apply to your face
in addition to the fact that the air makes my skin dry in this season
the only downside is that it you nerd to put some effort into putting this on your skin due to its gel like consistency
you have to pat it on instead of gliding it through the skin byt still worth it
i don't have to put powder afterwards when i use this
i get oily and dry and flaky at the same time.
then let it dry
i tend to be a bit oily
omg not only do my wrinkles look less deep
it's been difficult to get it to look smooth even with beauty blender until i got the j one jelly pack
the trick is to spread the jelly quickly when you first pump it out
then pat your face lightly.
the stickiness is going away as soon as you apply with the gentle massage throughout your face
i actually like the stickiness of the product when it first goes on
my face no longer looks oily
then lightly pat it into my skin
i would say give your face a good 5 minutes before applying your sunscreen or foundation
you need to let the product soak in
dry on your face for it to be effective
jelly pack did not disappoint
my face didn't feel slick or greasy.
then apply your usual make up
all you need to do in the morning is wash your face
this is a gluey gel mask/pack that can be used day or night
a lot of people are complaining about spilling the product in the shower
let your face air dry so it can sink in.
definitely worth the price if you're not into clay masking or long skincare regiment
so make sure to treat this splash mask like an actual face mask
just make sure you dilute it with some water before you splash it on your face to prevent it from stinging
although it was dry
my skin hasn't dried out at all
i think i may transfer it to a spray bottle to make it less wasteful
i find in the shower to be the easiest way
then let my face air-dry
i feel that the shower/splash/wash-off method is wasting product without getting the full effect--
you will have the softest clear skin when you wake up
i didn't have a separate bowl to measure it out in with the water
i also like that you can use this splash mask 1-2 times a day
it seems like you're just washing it down the drain
i let it air dry.
make sure that you dilute it with enough water
because otherwise it will dry your skin out horribly
regardless of how oily you are
felt like i was wasting a lot of it in the shower trying to pour it in my h
i spray it on my face in the shower really well
if you don't want to spend the money on expensive chemical peels
it really helped get rid of oil without over drying
it was a little dry/peeling this morning.
the next somewhat oily
it is not a typical serum in that it is not as watery
my skin is kind of tricky in that my t-zone is semi-oily
this combined with the hydrating essence strikes the perfect balance in making my entire face feel comfortably moist
it's easier to use the spactula that to take some out of the jar
fresh after cleansing- the only think i would say is that it is very liquidy
it may have helped with my pores a bit
and it doesn't dry my skin!
i love how it feels as it dries on my skin
almost like you get when you eat a mint
this doesn't dry me out
not to be dried out
i did notice some breakouts today so maybe it's from the mask unclogging my pores
not at all uncomfortable unlike some of my other detox masks
my face does not feel stripped or lacking moisture
did not dry out my skin
this one does not make your skin feel stripped after
although it didn't cause any irradiation it which is very common for me it left me with a patch of acne where i had applied it
no more so than if i just washed my face
it doesn't dry out my skin
i also love that its a mask that wont dry out
i typically have pretty good skin
of course this isn't a face-lift in a tub
it really works for oily
i swear i am not oily at the least
i should be an oily slick right now
i am scraping every last bit out of the container as to not waste any product
will plop it on my more oily areas
especially with all of this heat happening
since i have oily skin i like to keep the layers on my face to a minimum
after if you are experiencing some oily spots
help my skin be less oily
they keep me from getting too oily
these drops are pretty cool.
it also makes me look less oily
even in the heat
not greasy at all
knew i would be producing a lot of oil with the humidity
i do not have that oily of skin
my t-zone definitely gets oily
even if i'm not wearing much makeup i don't get oily at all throughout the day
i get enough shine to have to blot once or twice a day in the t zone
this makes my makeup stay in a mattifying form especially on my oily areas
i totally recommend this to anyone dealing with oily skin
it works amazing for me with dry skin in the summer with high temperatures
i can be dewy yet with no oiliness in the middle of the day
must have if you get a tad oily.
just a little bit of this mixed in doesn't change the formulas of my foundations
blotting in my t-zone during the day with a beauty blender to see how that does
there are much better matte primers out there
i didn't even have to blot my face!
keep me matte all day long
it doesn't get rid of all my oil to the point i no longer have to blot
it just made the oil disappear
i think the best thing about this product is that it controls oil without having to cake on powder
this light weight blot drop gel is crazy good
then if i'm feeling a lil extra oily
not even lancôme 24hr can totally hold all day without getting shiny on my skin
i applied this after my primer onto my most oily places
this product allowed me to wear my natural skin out proudly on a hot day
i hate how my pores look huge bc i get so oily on my nose
i do not have to blot
it is amazing to blot during the day or to use mixed into your foundation to matify if more
couldn't wear due to the greasy formula
i do notlook like an oil slick
i didn't even realize that i had an issue with discoloration on my skin until i used this product
one of my favorite things is that it dries down fairly quickly
don't have to wait forever for it to dry down to then apply moisturizer
as it does not leave your skin feeling tight like most serums
it's always good to early to take care of yourself it is smoothing
i really liked this eye cream because it was not greasy in my undereye area
it's not too much moisture where it makes the white bumps
this eye cream really does the trick!
i will sometimes get milia on
you could makeup swap out for a thicker night time eye cream occasionally at night if needed
they used this eye cream on me
not feel greasy or heavy is beyond me
end up buying this one cuz when i tired in store it instantly melt into my skin
doesn't make your skin oily or sticky
so the jar lasts awhile
because it is a cream you would think it would feel heavy on your face or leave it oily
i used philosophy's take a deep breath which is also oil free
no super dry skin either
i felt this cream provided enough moisture without being heavy
no cream will ever control oil 100%
my skin doesn't get dry during the day
do get dry in certain areas
moisturizes me without making me oily throughout the day/night
did not feel greasy during the day
my skin felt comfortable all day without looking shiny or greasy at the end of the day
this is a must if you have oily skin like me.
doesn't dry me out
i look forward to using this all summer when my skin becomes a little bit more oily
sometimes it gets dry
for someone with oily skin
i would expect such a thick moisturizer to do that normally
my patience was a bit thin of the "good for dry skin" advertising which never met expectations
i even decant this for travel as i can't be without it
moisturizes really well without being too oily or heavy
they take all the bad for you chemicals out.
this seems to even out my skin all around
doesn't irritate my skin or make it feel sticky unlike most moisturizers i've tried
it doesn't just disappear on the skin once it sinks in like a lot of other moisturizers do on my dehydrated skin
does not feel tight or too oily either
must buy for those wit dry or dehydrated skin!
this cream has been great for my dry skin because if goes on easily
feel it is the "real deal" in its ability to get moisture into my skin
have never had a dry face since nor do i experience excessively oily skin either
my skin is dry, sensitive and easily breaks out.
when your skin is dry or simply lackluster
i push gently on it to get smaller amounts out at a time
my oily parts haven't gotten worse either!
a little bit too oily for me
not lying when i say that out of all the moisturizers i've tried at sephora
without feeling heavy or greasy on the skin
my dry skin was gone in one use
i add 2 drops of sr's juno oil when i go to bed.
i rarely get oily
even though the weather is humid/hot this moisturizer doesn't make my skin greasy or oily
turns out i'm really dry
while i'm still oily in my t-zone
i love how heavy it is when i spread it on my face
s light enough not to go overboard when my skin is oily
it doesn't feel heavy or drying
i try to keep my skin care simple
i noticed i don't get greasy throughout the day when i wear this
before this my face was so drying!
now when i use my other moisturizer it feels so dry compared to this one
this cream just gives my face the moisture it's needed
i actually would like to take a bath on it
then the rest of my face is dry
it is not heavy at all nor greasy on your skin!
and it doesn't make my face feel oily or dry.
i don't find this to be too emollient for me
it doesn't make my skin more oily
i find that it actually helps control my oiliness
not heavy or greasy
i love that this moisturizer is thick enough to clear up any dry patches
i don't seem to be blotting quite as much as i do even when i use a mattifying or oil-control moisturizer
my face gets really bad dry patches so putting on makeup would be a mission cause it'd look flakey
none of them were as heavy or hydrating as this
in the end it left my skin feeling more dry than i wanted
had been using a heavier moisturizer than i usually would because of the winter weather
i absolutely do not feel greasy at all after applying this
without really being heavy or greasy
love the fact it doesn't irritate my skin
second the product is really great if your someone with oily skin you would probably like this better than the oil
it sinks into the skin so nicely i absolutely love the stuff when you run out will be re-purchasing a little pricey
change my skin the way this cream did it is sothick
you'd never know i struggled for so long with super dry skin
doesn't stick to any dry patches
use this product mainly when my skin is in need for instant moisture
wonderfully rich without being oily or having a "plastic" feel to it
i live in a very dry desert-y climate where the wind blows
i like that its not greasy
this gets rid of pesky dry areas a most overnight
was wary about trying another moisturizer with oil in it
this cream also doesn't feel greasy at all on me
my skin isn't too oily or dewy looking afterwards
doesn't leave skin greasy
not the slightest bit greasy
even in humid weather in hawaii
especially when it is cold
my skin doesn't feel dry throughout the day with it
anyway this moisturizer doesn't make me break out
perfect for winter when i get extra dry
it would look horrible bc of how dry my eyelids are it would look very flakey
then use my eye primer as normal
gets pretty oily in summer
jar packaging because products tend to get under my long nails
aside from the oils in it that make it smell like a nut
doesn't make my skin oily or breakout
my t zone shows a little bit oily when i use it overnight
my skin for the last 2 years has been so dry that during harsh winters the skin on my face would start to flake like d
do not be weary if you have oily or acne prone skin
the dry ares which i tend to get in the winter
never feels greasy or heavy
my skin usually gets so dry in the winter that it hurts
i used this all winter and my skin never got dry!
since i've been sick with a nasty cold
using this product sporadically when i need extra help with moisture
looked more glowy then when i used this product
it's not over drying
it stays on perfectly until i decide to rinse it off
i get shiny from being hot
used it initially to control shine because i hate the way powder looks on my dry
wash it off with my clarisonic in the shower
so glad i took a chance on this stuff even though i have normal to dry skin
this is the best cleanser i have used so far it pulls out all my oils on my face
i actually use this more as a cleanser right now because it's hot
i could see myself using this more as a mask for weekly use during the fall or winter when my skin isn't as oily
not wear heavy foundation or nothing at all
i've never used it alone because i have moisturizers targeted toward oily skin that work really well for me
although i have very dry
can feel a little heavy on the face
this stuff doesn't do much to hydrate
i allow it to soak in for a bit
i think those with drier skin
she suggested mixing 1 part of this stuff with 1 part of your foundation then spot concealing the rest of your skin
i break out easy, i don't blame the lotion.
didn't have to mix it with my liquid stuff
my nose would be so dry at times it looked like it was peeling
not dry at all
most importantly it doesn't feel oily at all it's a thicker formula
do not use if you have oily skin!!!
it does not make me oily throughout the day
those just weren't hydrating enough for this type of use
need something with enough moisture
just enough that on oily summer days i can forego a layer under the sunblock mix
it doesn't leave a tone on your skin
i wouldn't recommend wearing it under a medium or full coverage foundation as i think it could look a little too thick or cakey
the shade though wasn't enough tone for me.
putting it on my skin was no hassle
it add just the right amount of glow.
it's not a big deal for me to apply my regular moisturizer underneath this
it does wonders for my dull and dry skin!
i like that this doesn't make my skin look too shiny or oily
f you are light skinned it's going to change your color significantly
it did keep me matte for a while
this didn't keep me matte all day though.
it gives the perfect amount of moisture without making my skin look oily
clearly doesn't cause me to be extra oily
i don't feel like it really moisturizes my skin more than any other product
which is really saying something because i have very dry skin
the sales gal told me i can use it on my eye lids too
it does smell like fish oil when you first put it on
i always have to make sure the product doesn't have ingredients which will clog my pores
it doesn't make my face oily
i found this oil to be my ultimate winter skin oil
t just kind of floats on my skin
sometimes it gets too oily or dry.
completely get why they used fragrance so mask it
not too watery or too thick spreads like a dream so fewer drops will work especially in this hot humid nyc weather at the moment
can't wait to see how it beats the harsh winter weather
i still find the need to layer my night cream on top
this stuff is my favorite facial oil i've ever tried
there is no drying or anything
i let it sit on my face for at least a minute so the charcoal has time to absorb any impurities
it's much cheaper than some other face washes
my face is always oily
i love the feeling of taking off my makeup with a gel rather than some sort of cream or oily liquid
it does not dry out my skin
while also not leaving the skin feeling super dry or overworked
a little hard to wash off
i can feel my skin breathe once i scrub my face with this stuff
it doesn't dry out my skin either which is rare.
it completely gets rid of any oil
winter along with harsh products can easily cause it to flare up
my skin is so oily you could fry chicken on it!
it's such a nice thing to wash your face with!
especially if you have combination skin.
doesn't feel like it takes forever to rinse it off
it doesn't dry out my skin
before adding moisturizer my face feels a bit drier than usual-
i do use a great face scrub 2-3 times a week
sometimes i need a little extra scrub
this is a really nice cleanser for getting rid of the day
i didn't find this overly drying, either.
i love charcoal products because they are effective on the type of acne i usually get
is not overly drying like a lot of other charcoal products
so you can use it everyday without worrying about dryness
have noticed my skin being less oily the next day
this did not make my face oily
will recommend to everyone with oily skin or even combo skin
am really not supposed to use exfoliates because they irritate my skin
didn't irritate my sensitive skin at all or overly dry it out
this is great way to get rid of the muck that soap
this does not make my skin tight
didn't experience drying at all
i even have oily skin
i wouldn't recommend this to anyone with dry skin because my skin is oily
i'd hate to see it on normal skin
this face wash is just as good
it really gets rid of the dead skin
smooth every time i use it
doesn't dry me out
it does not add to my oilyness that usually creeps in an hour after i wash my face
it just leaves my face soft without being dry or oily
this product does not dry out my skin
it is not drying
just washed my face using the same light pressure as i would with regular cleanser
like that it didn't dry out my already dry skin.
it does a decent job as a face wash
it helps with the dry skin on my face
it has just the right amount of grit for me to use it daily without being too drying
they do get the job done without drying the skin out
it hasn't dried out my sensitive skin at all
using this every day would make my face super dry
my skin has not feelt dry at all.
just be careful don't let the scrub get into your eyes
it is light weight once you put it on
i think this is best for those who have oily to oily combination skin since it sort of leaves your skin matte
it is not oily
does not cause my liquid foundation to slip around on my face
it really does blur pores especially if you use a primer as well
set it with powder and you're on your way.
it doesn't prevent my face from looking shiny as the day goes on
so far this seems to help keep the dry patches on my face moisturized so they don't get flaky under makeup
this doesn't feel heavy on my oily t zone
this one does not dry my skin out at all
it's impossible for me to find a primer that will stop the oil on my forehead without my cheeks drying out
this keeps my face matte for more hours than others
yet it controlled my oily t-zone to an extent
like it only during the day as its really good for using more as a light moisturizer
better as a primer because it doesn't make my face feel cakey with my foundation
i like how it applies and that it dries fast!
if you are a dry girl i totally recommend!
let me start by saying i have oily skin
you still need a moisturizer though because it feels a little drying in my opinion
more dry in the winter
primers for that usually aren't good for dry skin
it is now a holy grail primer for me: it has enough moisture to keep dry skin at bay under makeup
just slightly more hydrating than the others out there
i would recommend for normal to dry skin.
it has a slightly cooling feeling when your first apply
so many reviews talk about this balling up or pilling- i've worn this under 3 different foundations this week
i notice i'm not reaching for my powder
i do need to use a pore filler on my cheeks to really blur everything out if i want a more flawless completion
some of the reviewers are like "i have dry skin
especially if you get an oily forehead by 5pm
this product will leave a girl with oily skin a giant oil mess so please if you have oily skin save your money
this product is great to use right out of the shower when you want to hydrate your skin before it becomes flakey
does the job without being oily or making my pores worse
f you have super dry skin you would probably still need a moisturizer underneath
it goes on dry
if a cream can be dry
doesn't leave any sort of residue
i feel it is more of a base for makeup rather than a daily moisturizer since it doesn't feel rich enough it
i love to moisturize as much as possible to keep my skin from producing excess oil
it may not be a great choice for someone with dry skin
it's got a lot of fillers in it which is normal for a formula like this
it doesn't feel like silicone at all to me
doesn't have that silicone feel which i hate
it almost feels like it would be oily
it's to the point that the person who does my facial cringes every time she exfoliates it for me
i can't take a normal shower without reacting to the chlorine in warm-hot water
most people just get dry and ashy, i get hives.
doesn't leave my t zone looking too oily like many moisturizers do
while this doesn't keep me matte any longer than normal
it hydrates which does go a long way with daily use
doesn't leave my face oily
i wouldn't say it leaves it matte either
you don't need much just a thin layer
what i love about the product is how it absorbs into my skin
i noticed that my skin didn't look as oily in my t zone through out my
as someone with oily skin
doesn't make me look or feel greasy
always on the hunt to find the perfect one that suits my combination skin
this stuff does wonders for my dry skin
you will wake up with your skin plump
a lot of them made my skin break out or feel really sticky
if i dont use oil or moisturizer it can even get flaky
for daytime i prefer something lighter
i made it work with the dry areas on my face only
it's perfect for winter and dry patches.
the creams sinks right into the skin making an immediate difference in the way my skin feels
would not recommend for oily skin though
it does wonders for my dry
you can really feel it tightening your skin
if u have dry skin just try it.
as i need more moisture in winter
but no need to do than with my egg mellow cream.
my skin also has a glow to it when i use it under or over foundation
this cream is very hydrating without being too thick or leaving too much of a sheen
not greasy or too heavy- just right.
sometimes feel the need that my skin is a bit dry
don't have to worry about dry patches or flaking throughout the day
i feel like it helps my face not become an oil slick
i like to use a double pump after i do any sort of deep cleaning mask
great to use before applying make up because it makes your skin very soft
it did leave a certain light tackiness after application
this is the reason i feel like this would make a better sleeping mask than used as a daily moisturizer
a little of this product goes a long way the more you rub it in the thinner it becomes allowing for it to cover a large area without requiring multiple pumps
which sucks in the colder months
it's probably a little light on its own for dry skin
it does not linger on my skin
i tap it into my skin like the instructions say before applying other serum
now if i use it at night as a mask i do apply it thicker on the dry areas of my face
i try not to apply to much though to the oily areas of my face because it does make it worse
does not become greasy like other creams i have tried in the past
tend to get a little oily
1 pump is all i need for all day moisture
even in the morning when i went to wash my face again i still felt the softness as i was rinsing my face
by using this cream my skin got way better
not get ashy throughout the day
is not oily or sticky, you'll love this cream.
it starts off sticky then changes which is pretty cool
the first night i used it i didn't care for the sticky texture
heads up, when using do not rub!
i usually don't buy any moisturizer that is fragranced because for some reason i'm just imagining it clogging my pores
doesn't feel heavy under my foundation
dry in the winter
this hasn't left me greasy or oily in the few times i've used it so far
which i think helps you spread it evenly all over your face
have no problems with it being too greasy or not soaking in
it is fragranced so pass over this one if you're sensitive
doesn't leave it greasy
the first time i try out this product i totally mess it up because i wasn't used to the kind of brushy format it has
i think dry skin would probably want to layer this over something
if your norm/oily like me it will be your holy grail illuminator
does not cause my makeup to slide around yet still provides enough hydration underneath to withst
some days it’ll be as oily as an oil slick
day if i’m more on the dry side: the water cream.
it gives you the perfect amount of hydration without making you oily
balanced even in very humid weather
my nose still gets super oily as of this point
i wake up not looking like a grease ball
i don't experience any sticky
i didn't bother to even care about foundation until my skin was less textured
not heavy or greasy
check to see if u are using too many acidic or exfoliants
again a little goes a long way not more ore it may dry to thick
skin can only absorb so much.
would probably not suit oily skin
where it tends to get super dry
it helps hydrate my skin enough where it doesn't feel the need to produce excessive oils
they both absorb right into the skin
have a sticky feeling right after applying
it goes away when dry
i recommend this if you have combination to dry skin
i don't usually rave over skin care or makeup products because nothing i've tried has controlled my oily skin
my t-zone starts of extremely dry to the point where you can see flakes
because of this i have to use more mattifying products or i will look extremely greasy by the end of the day
the only downside i have is it is quite tacky for several minutes until it dries fully which can be a bit annoying when doing my makeup
does not make me greasy
i know when its all soaked up by my skin
as my skin gets insanely dry towards the end of summer
i couldn't be happier with the lightweight consistency that doesn't clog my pores
this moisturizer feels just like water when you pump it out
i hope it's not too drying when the winter comes
non-greasy that my skin is so happy whenever i use this gel on it
i feel like the tatcha line truly repairs my skin to do what make-up is covering up
at first i applied a little too much it made my face feel sticky
when u only use a little bit theres no stickiness it made my face softer it looked more even
so you have to let it dry for 5-10 minutes before applying primer
seriously good if you have bad pores!
maybe bc my face is so dry after washing
that moisturizers like this are great for people 30+ who want to reclaim that plump youthful look to their skin
i like to mix this with a drop of face oil
i do notice that it is a little sticky before it completely dries
this one provided just the right amount of hydration without making my skin oily
if you used too many pumps "off course" it's going to be too sticky
a half before my makeup every morning my skin is less oily because of the hydration this offers
i don't think it stops oil to appear on the face during the day without a primer
i do not have oily skin
i didn't mind because i felt like that was just the consistency of the formula to seal in moisture
truly perfect for any oily gals living in the south during the hot
some days i am an oily mess
only need a little kick of moisture without that heavy
does not leave my skin sticky either.
there is a "sticky" kind of feel to your face once applied
combination skin that gets pretty oily during the summer
i didn't notice the gold glow once i applied it to my skin
maybe because i have brown skin
however i feel as if the tackiness grabs my foundation
for something to help with my oily skin
it's the only gel i've used that delivers the perfect amount of moisture without looking too greasy
when i do blot
i could be oily one day then dry the next
decided not to blot because the combination of sweat
powder makes the foundation on my nose separate whenever i do that
i knew tatcha was gonna come through for the oily girls like they did for the dry girls with the dewy mist
was actually dry to the touch
i've discovered that this gel looks much better when i use just half a pump
gives me just enough moisture
this is the best product out there for oily skin.
it's like water on the skin
during the wintertime it likely won't be enough
mpressed as i've actually found my face is much less oily on the mornings i use this
doesn't make my face dry
you can actually feel it deep cleaning your skin.
i could literally feel the dead skin
take it with me when i go on trips it removes the dry skin when i feel like my skin needs a little extra tlc
does not dry out my skin or feel harsh
it is really nice to use when my skin is extra oily- it feels like it gets my skin very clean
you rub it on your face then use your h
it definitely does a good job of gently removing any dead skin
doesn't leave it feeling dry like i just used cheap toner on it
i also love that it's colored because i feel like it's easier for me to tell when i need to keep rinsing to remove all the cleanser product
making it hard to scrub your face with
i didn't have that problem of the product melting at all
doesn't irritate my skin at all
this exfoliator does a perfect job of taking off the dead skin without harming anything else
you literally just dampen your face rub this baby on it
you can also leave it on for up to 10 mi as a deep cleaning treatment
highly recommend for those who get oily because they have dry skin
the only con to this product is that it melts a little bit if you put too much water on it
doesn't irritate my skin too much
if you use the drink of h20 from tarte afterwards you will love your skin
some parts can be abrasive.
that being said the stick itself can get a little messy in the lid
i love scrubbing my face then leaving it there for a bit then rinse
gets rid of all my dry patches
i wet my face then apply.
then i rub it in my skin
then i let this product sit on my face so all the awesome ingredients soak in
my make up applies so evenly afterwards.
usually they either dry out my face or don't clean me enough
not drying it out
i always feel like it does a great job cleaning without being too harsh for my normal to dry sensitive skin
maybe if you keep swishing the stick around your face you'll only get a few uses out of it
this helps me so much when i start to breakout or my pores feel a little more noticeable or ruff looking
the exfoliating scrubbies are small enough that it doesn't feel like you are scratching your face
there is almost a cooling sensation when you first rub the stick on your skin
how it really gets in there to clean out your pores
most other exfoliators dry me out even more
i love it, exfoliates, but doesn't sting or hurt.
i never thought of tarte as a company that made face wash however this is a game changer
can use this in my everyday routine to help get all the dirt grime
it will leave your face (and fingers) super soft!
that it seems bad germ wise to just rub it all over your face that is wet
is really easy to wash off when you're done
if i had to give it one i would say it mostly smells like glycerin
my dry areas get really dry
my t-zone gets very oily
i don't feel dried out
my pores actually appear to be better too.
actually cause more damage by making micro cuts rather than what they should do which is slough off dead skin
this exfoliator is awesome because its not harsh nor damaging
i like this product it does gently
it doesn't seem to strip too much oil off your skin
before they can properly form even on my dry forehead without overdrying it
not harsh or drying.
clean with out irritating it
anyway i still like it better than any other exfoliator i have tried
it's easy to apply and quick to wash off.
perfect in the shower just running the stick over damp skin
down side 1- i feel that if you get it wet the stick gets "smushy" for lack of a better term
it's best to put it on dry skin- the product is soft so you don't need to press too hard
it took off alot of dry skin
it does need to be applied on the thicker side for an easy peel
the parts that just don't come off easily wash off
the trick is to apply enough layers for you to be able to peel it after the product has dried
you can just rinse off what you can't peel.
the only thing is that is really strips the oil of my face
which is expected because it's a peel
you really do want to put a thin layer on your face because it's almost like having your face waxed
once you peel the mask off omg your skin is so soft
i think you have to apply a generous amount for it to actually peel off
i didn't realize until after i used it that you have to put a thick even layer on
why reviewers are saying that this mask is hard to peel off
yes you have to put a certain amount over your face to get the proper treatment however peeling this mask off is simple
any thing that's left over you can simply wipe away with a wet cloth
i used just a little on my tzone where i most oily
what it did do was made my pores tiny
it does dry super fast though.
then apply my oil
another bonus was it did not dry out my skin
you need to put a good amount on your face to be able peel it off completely
not much more than any other peel off mask
it was really fast drying unlike the boscia one
i put about the same amount i would have on my other peel off mask
it did dry out my skin
i feel like a lot of peel off masks do
i wouldn't recommend it for sensitive or dry skin
was fairly easy to peel off
i really like this face peel!
t makes my eyes water
sometimes it makes my skin feel oily the next day
especially if you're skin is more on the dry side
i can actually see on what one peeled off the blackheads on it
it does kind of hurt peeling it off
my skin did feel kind of dry after
f you have very dry skin it might not be good
don't apply too thin
don't let it dry too much or it won't peel well
as well when you wash off excess you'll have to use warm water
be careful if your washing your face in the sink the peeled off pieces wont melt too quickly
or maybe i just need to put a thicker layer on
the smell does quickly dissipate leaving behind this orange mask that's so much fun to peel
you may squeeze the bottle in store
it may help to have a fan or a vent going to help you push through the beginning of it so you can breathe clean air for a second
continue putting the mask on if your nose is very sensitive like mine
actually made me cough because of it
aside from the smell you can get over it
like as if you put lemon juice in your eye
my face feels much more fresh after this peel than any face wash i've used in years
f you have a really sensitive nose you can smell it
anyway you have to let it dry fully in all areas of application for it to peel off neatly
areas that did dry completely peeled right off.
doesn't make the skin oily
it skins into my skin rather than sitting on the surface like many other moisturizers out there
this origin moisturizer is very good in all day it doesn't give my skin very oily
i find my skin is not as oily at the end of the day as well
this product does not cause my makeup to bleed
it is not oily
does not leave a greasy feel so my h
i like how the texture is not oily
it gives my skin just enough moisture without making it greasy
it smells like a wet rag that has been sitting on the counter
kind of like dirty or mold
the smell stays on the skin for a long time as well
the combo of lazy+sensitive doesn't lend itself to actually washing my face
doesn't burn or make me red
i really have to rub
i find it more drying than i would like around my eyes
i like to see that a product is really showing you every piece of dirt on your face whether it's before or after you've cleansed your face
it's the first one i've used that doesn't sting my sensitive skin
i love to use this is the morning when i'm too lazy to use a cleanser since you don't have to rinse it off
the only problem i have with the cleanser is the pump does not disperse correctly
use this my skin clear up in days cause i have bad bad breaks out
my skin looks super clean- pores aren't nearly as noticeable because they're cleaned out
i'd have to say it's because real green tea leaves are contained in the bottle
my t zone tends to get very very oily
to the point i can't even put my face in ocean water
might be a little drying if you tend to be a dry skin client
never dry or tight
doesn't strip or dry it either.
without the dry feel after cleansing
now i find i can tell a difference in the texture/softness of my skin when i don't use this
is still gentle enough that it doesn't dry me out
it can be drying
doesn't dry it out
i don't feel super dry or stripped when i use it
a little pump can cover your whole face.
unfortunately my skin is a little to dry for this
good product just not for dry skin.
it didn't dry my skin out either
i appreciate that it doesn't dry my skin especially during winter
it gets very dry in the winter
unfortunately my chin is still really dry
my dryness isn't getting worse
it burns my eyes so that's why this is my go to for the morning
can really dry your face out
i only need one pump or less to wash my whole face
i can go back to neogen dermalogy's green tea real fresh foam cleanser to bring me back to my baseline
a little more drying than what i'd like
the foam is thick that you only need a little bit of the product
when you rinse it your since feels so soft
when you add water
i love it because it won't dry out my skin like other cleansers tend to do
it is light enough to manage warm temperatures without heaviness
you don't need a ton of product for a deep cleanse
this face wash doesn't dry me out
i recommend using a toner immediately after this to avoid being too dry
a little bit goes a long way — i use one pump to wash my face in the evenings
make sure to rinse well with lukewarm water!
the reason why i give this 4/5 stars is because this bleached my skin
i want to keep massaging it on my face forever
i like to let it sit on my face for a few seconds after i've massaged it on my skin as well to let my skin absorb some of the nutrients
some days i more oily.
i don't feel stripped of moisture afterwards
with little water applied to my face
doesn't leave my skin tight or dry
i stopped using foam cleansers a while back because i heard it can dry out your skin
your skin can go through a bad phase where its bringing all the bad stuff to the surface
it clears up my skin quickly without drying my skin or making it feel tight
you know those mud masks that make your skin so tight?
i am always weary at trying a new skin care product
i try to use the least amount of chemicals not only in my skin
i still needed a deep cleaning mask to pull all the junk out of my skin
to where you can still move your face after it is completely dry
it isn't a miracle worker when you need that extra pore cleaning
i'll probably stick to origins charcoal mask when i need that deep cleaning job done
most mud masks are too drying for me
does not irritate my skin at all
not oily at all
not sure how anyone can possibly claim that a mud mask is "hydrating"
meaning that it doesn't dry out the skin as much
does not leave my skin feeling tight or dry like the many other mud masks i've tried
washing the mask off is easy, too.
i do feel it did only s tad better of a job then cleaning timer
uncomfortable feel when on your skin like a lot of mud masks
when you rinse it off your skin feels so soft
doesn't dry out itself
this is a great mask for normal to oily skin types bc it doesn't overly dry out your skin
not sure of the reason people with dry skin in general would want to use a clay mask
it makes it difficult to try new skincare products because it can become worse if my skin hates it
you can literally watch this mask suck the oils out of your skin
doesn't dry out my skin when i use it at night
let it dry while i'm getting ready
the grit is so gentle it doesn't irritate my face
even my greasy combination skin is fine with 2 -3 times a week at most
it does a great job of getting rid of the extra oil on my face
does not irritate my skin at all
it feels great on the skin as a mask- i prefer to use it as
highly recommend it if you have dry skin
its oily in the summer and dry in the winter.
it may not provide enough moisture
especially in harsher or dryer weather conditions
my face isn't that oily
the problem with oil free moisturizers is that my skin usually feels dry even after i use it
with this amazing product i look forward to putting this stuff on i have combo skin dry on cheeks
i soon realized like most products it's a scam when there's any oil in a product it will enlarge your pores
makes double your natural oil plus yours putting oil infused product on your face it's a vicious cycle
is still provided enough moisturizer because i don't feel any grease hours after putting in on
if your oily it is a must have
people with dry skin might not dig this product like i do since it's very light weight
struggle finding a moisturizer that doesn't break me out or feel greasy yet is still hydrating
it is not oily at all
the packaging is very well designthis moisture gives me the moisture i need without give me a greasy feeling
i do not like sticky oily rich face products.
ok i'm going to start by saying that my face is super oily
did not leave a heavy tacky residue
not greasy at all.
you've got to let it absorb into the skin for at least 90 seconds before applying another layer
that it doesn't make me oily throughout the day
i would also rather get the pump rather than the container version because i feel that it's more hygienic
so you can just use this instead of layering anti aging
no sticky feeling either!
my skin will be more oily when i don't use this
i only use this at night however because of the tacky feeling it leaves on my skin
or if i need a quick moisture treatment
used everything under the sun
i love how this comes with a spoon so you don't contaminate the product
it hydrates yet does not make me look like an oil slick
because this is in a jar
i wouldn't recommend super dry skin to try this.
it becomes extremely dry during the winter
i love that you get a little spatula with the cream
so that you don't have to dip your fingers in
a little seems to go a long way: dipping the spatula into the product once provides enough cream for a full face
there's also a lot of cream in the container
it is not drying at all
it works best when applied to dry skin
it is a lighter/looser oil with a pump so you need to cup your h
does not leave behind a film or residue
does not dry out my face
it's the only cleansing oil that i've tried where i didn't feel like i needed to immediately wash my face
does not linger once you rinse it off
my skin is neither too oily nor too dry
sometimes will use it right before washing my face for some moisture retention
only down side is that it doesn't lather as well
as soon as you apply water to wash off the oiliness is gone
you only need 1 pump to wash off your entire face
another nice feature is that it didn't dry my skin at all
after i rinse it off my face it doesn't make my face feel oily or my eyes all blurry
then something else to wash my face
it really does seem to dissolve the dirt
feels too oily at first
so smooth the smell is amazing not too perfumy which to me is a plus to me removes my makeup so easy i wear smashbox foundation
adding a little warm water if needed
this isn't something that will "dig deep" because it is a cleansing oil
it will prep your skin for the nighttime if you are feeling clean or if you're getting ready to exfoliate
perfect for dry winters
no make up or dirt was found on my toner cotton ball
using an oil to wash my already oily face was confusing to me
not wash my face etc
with this cleansing oil you can use way less
always dried my skin even more than it already is
although it leaves ur skin super oily after use you can remove with water or a cleanser
i put it on dry skin
then i add water to wash it away
i've read some reviews that say to add water to it before applying it to your skin
when you wash it off with water
a lot of it washes off too unlike other oils where they literally will not budge unless you use a lot of cleanser
if anyone is familiar with the la splash liquid lipsticks you know those are next to impossible to remove
most cleansers either don't cleanse enough or dry me out too much
then you naturally have to double cleanse anyways
i usually do a second cleanse to get all my make up off
sometimes i need to do a little clean up on leftover eye make up
i think if i use more product it will emulsify better
i did not find it sticky at all .
i would warn to do a good rinse
i am a sucker for anything that will make my skin dewy
but overall, i do like this cleansing oil.
since it's water based i'm not concerned about my pores
this is not oily
i like how it goes on light and clean.
now am able to wear just a light powder
it is not too oily
usually creams on my face are either not moisturizing enough or they are too oily
usually creams on my face are either not moisturizing enough or they are too oily
don't work well with my skin
it went on very refreshing and non oily.
i can even go without makeup on days off without feeling like i look sickly from all the redness
it isn't enough for my very dry chin
you do get a little bit of stickiness
hot weather or skin that tends to be very oily or sweaty
this does not leave any slickness on the skin once it's been absorbed
skip over this because this adds an instant flush to the skin
it actually does give you a nice glow, not oily.
this gives phenomenal moisture without making you look greasy i have oily skin so my skin does greasy all on it's own
it is watery, but i'm ok with that.
i feel as if my face is splash with moisture
gives my skin that slight drink of water it needs
3 it's great to pat on drier areas of my face throughout the day to keep my makeup from settling in dry
it is difficult to squeeze from tube without getting too much because it such a thin liquid
i feel this would be an awesome light day moisturizer for my oily skin type for almost year round here
perfect for those hot/humid days here in florida
i would not recommend this product to anyone that has dry skin as it would not provide enough moisture
this was a fun product to try- it has a very runny
it's good for just a bit of moisture now that i live in a humid climate
derms say they do not dry out skin
it is not the same as the rubbing alcohol you have at home
it could just be because i have dry skin
i didn't feel like it made my oiliness worse
need something much lighter during the day under my primer
it helps me avoid any dry flakes on my face with my foundation
you may need something a little heavier for a night cream
i love it i have dry skin
especially in the heat of summer
chin that they aren't super oily right away
however i don't think it will be enough for damaged dry skin come winter
maybe i'm just too use to thick creams to change.
skin type: super duper dry (but not anymore!!!)
the texture makes you want to continuously rub wherever you touched on everything else
this doesn't leave any residue on your skin or make it feel oily
refresh feel to my skin when i don't have time to do full wash
it does have to dry.
it never gets oily or tacky or sticky even after hours of wear
usually no matter what i use my face ends up looking like a grease pit
you can feel it make your face matte immediately
absorbs quickly so you can do your makeup with no problems
doesn't make my face too oily
it doesn't help my oily skin
i only use it when its going to be a hot day to protect me from the sun
love it - not greasy at all.
haven't tested it in prolonged sun exposure as it's been raining
it does not smell like sunscreen in the slightest
don't have any problems with oil/shine any more
it is slightly too drying on dry areas of my face
it's just okay my face still gets semi oily through out the day
perhaps less sensitive or less acne prone then this is it for you
really oily in the summer
la weather makes my skin a oily almost all year round
on warmer days i only use this cream nothing else
on really hot days just a toner
you'll never be squeezing it out
i tend to get oily when it is hot
it keeps my face perfect for hours honestly don't feel the need to blot
i would recommend if you have very oily skin.
doesn't make my face feel greasy or break out like other moisturizers with spf have
in both situations my face was matte for only 5 hours
i get patches of dry skin due to my hot showers
i very easily get sun burn
got it for the spf
i give it 4 stars because i still can't wear it every day without being concerned about clogged pores
still have pretty greasy skin i thought would dissipate as i got older
this moisturiser along with not breaking me out keeps my skin matte which is a huge bonus
i can go all day without looking like a grease ball
i will admit that toward the end of the 8 hr day my skin will become a bit oily
wouldn't leave my skin greasy
tend to get oily around my t-zone
my face doesn't get nearly 1/2 as oily
doesn't really get down into my skin
that's fine for me cause i just use another lotion that doesn't have spf first
this is the only moisturizer that doesn't leave me a greasy mess in the summer
does what it claims, weightless under my make-up.
it never feels over dry
especially if you have oily skin
i would use cautioun if you have dry skin as this is totally mattifying
finding a moisturizer to keep my oil under control was next to impossible
but with continued use it made my skin dry.
if you're going for a once in a while matte look
things got less humid
i found this to be too drying
it doesn't dry out or grease my face.
while at a festival i did not feel my face turn oily like it had with other moisturizers
the weather is hot
it's worked great for me when in dry climates
oily t-zone/dry everywhere else
i gave 4 stars because i could use just a little more moisture
it's not moisturizing enough for my taste to use in colder weather when my skin gets very dry
all moisturizers that say they're mattifying always seem to either flake off or aren't really matte or dry my skin out
this product works great under my makeup or by itself in the texas heat
for all my oily
i mostly use it on areas of my face that tend to be more oily
that tends to get me through the rest of the day with limited shine
doesn't dry out those slightly dryer patches you may have
this is much better at not making me super shiny than any other moisturizer i've tried
not too thick or too think.
keeping you matte immediately as well as throughout the day
it really does dry entirely matte
think maybe it could be a bit more spreadable
some are too greasy or heavy feeling
then use this mixed with primer to keep my skin from getting greasy in the humidity
it seems as if the product does last the day without feeling heavy or greasy
hate wearing sunscreen on my face because they tend to make my skin look worse
it doesn't make me oily either.
made my face more oily
doesn't have that thick texture i hate in the smashbox
yes it makes your skin dry
live in a cold dry climate that doesn't help
with that being said every cleanser i've tried formulated for "dry skin" has left me feeling as though it has done nothing
it doesn't dry my skin
it burns my eyes a little bit if it gets in them
i don't typically wear foundation
i usually only put primer on my skin before foundation
it's one of the only thicker moisturizers i've found that doesn't make me oily through the day
i see some people have had issues with applying makeup over it-you have to let this moisturizer on your face for 10-30 minutes
i wish it came in a different package that wasn't so susceptible to bacteria-- i do not care for jar products
i absolutely did not fine this cream to be heavy or sticky at all
i didn't get flaking or white stuff during use
doesn't give as much moisture during winter though
i am only giving 4 stars due to it being so drying
it doesn't leave your skin oily or leave any residue
i just assume it is a rice water
i still do generally rinse this if i can.
this is the only thing i'll use to take off my makeup when i'm feeling lazy
i can get a little lazy with my facial care routine
i can get lazy with doing my full cleaning routine
sleeping in this did not break out my sensitive skin
plus, it feels cool while applying.
plan on using it everyday as part of my skin care regiment for my combination oily skin
not dry or shiny.
the dry down is actually more pleasant than the initial smell
when i get a new zit or large pimple it will clear it up in about 2 days as opposed to the 2-3 weeks my skin usually takes to heal from a breakout
this doesn't dry out my skin
i know if you have acne prone skin you might be scared of putting oil on your face due to your pores getting clogged
literally over night it cleared up just make sure to use a good moisturizer because it does cause some dryness
the texture on my face is going away as well.
i just happen to have a sensitive nose to it
just want to add that i use the sunday riley slip clay cleaner
it did not irritate or dry my skin at all.
certain face washes my skin was super dry because of the products so my skin would produce more oil which would cause more breakouts
my otherwise oily skin didn't get greasy throughout the day
f you have oily/combination skin it's best to only use at night
it will just on top of your skin
it does say if your skin is prone to purging to use 2-3 x a week
somewhat sensitive skin that doesn't break out often
combating whatever clogged pore situation you might have
it's that extra boost my skin needed to keep it feeling
it doesn't dry out your skin
neither leaves it greasy
having combination oily skin really puts you off because you are prone to break outs easily with excess oil on the t-zone
while other products helped they all dried out my skin
usually oils break me out
when my skin messes up from trying a new beauty product
it just doesn't smell nearly as good as most luxury skin care
i only use it when i feel like my skin is congested
i don't know if it is the combination of a very thick moisturizing cream that balances out this oil as it can dry up your skin
use it once at week at first so you reduce the chance of getting the whiteheads that can happen as your skin purges all the toxins
i find that it does leave an oily residue
how they treat your skin
in the winter i suffer from severely dry skin
my skin is much less clogged
my skin has responded really well to this dry oil
do not mix this in with moisturizer because it does not sink into the skin
the gunk making it look bad to begin with
this oil isn't drying or irritating for my sometimes sensitive skin
no matter what scrub
just make sure to use it with toner
oily skin you may want to read through it
definitely very very oily in the t-zone area in the warmer months
put oil on your oily face
even in places i don't normally get acne
when i do get the occasional blemish
i will warn you it can make your skin feel kinda oily in the morning
used to be pretty oily
now that i'm getting older i have really dry patches on my face
she mentioned that my increasingly oily t-zone could mean i need more moisture
my face did not feel oily or slick
not oily at all so far with or without makeup
not drying in the winter
because we haven't gotten into the thick of the summer
this oil actually helps unclog the pores so whatever is in them can work its way out without causing acne
unless my skin is extra troublesome
- this oil isn't fast absorbing as they say it is- it kind of sat on top of my skin
when the weather isn't dry
make my skin worse
this is amazing the texture of my skin has subsided i don't break out as much
using it once at night does not dry me out.
so this product does dry out my cheeks a little
it'll literally change your skin.
i don't want some thin veil of gel or whatever just on my face
t doesn't fall off your skin
you get a generous amount of product so the jar lasts
i do a pretty thin layer which works just as well
the scent lasts for awhile after you wash it off.
!i rub a bit on my face, really massage it in.
it keeps my face from drying out if i use it during a bath
it does feel like a jelly consistency
it can get a little sticky once it's dried
always making me feel that i'm actually feed my skin with some real food xdit helps brighten up my face a bit
i would not use it for summer because of the stickiness
i couldn't get it off my face with warm water-i had to use my clarisonic
it is very easy to wash off
it is kind of hard if you just using warm water
t better work with a towel or something
people do not like the feel that you are like shrimp that is shrinking
i like the fact that it is almost like putting apricot jam on your face
if you can get past the texture
it doesn't sting like some other face mask do
i love using this after traveling when my skin is dry
this mask is hard to get off once it dries
since i been using this cleaner my skin is no longer tight or dry
so what if it feels like jelly?
it only looks like jelly in the can
i like knowing it won't drip or super dry out my skin while using it
it doesn't feel sticky at all
it left no residue for me
sometimes i'll just use it under my eyes for a quick morning fix
as someone who has oily to dry skin
i don't typically go for all natural masks
so much so that i sometimes don't want to put makeup on since my face looks so naturally lit up
this mask is literally like food for your face
you could probably just crush a bunch of fruit together
this guy doesn't notice when i cut my hair more less a change in face regimen
smooth it reminded him of our blanket
lumps of stuff sitting on my face can't be effective i'd prefer if it had a smooth consistency
all those lumps like marmalade were blended in as i think that's a waste washing down the sink
i feel like putting the stuff in a blender ....
my oily skin didn't feel as oily the next day either
it is sticky but not too bad.
found it didn't dry down much
i like to use a mask almost everyday
nor did my face feel any oilier than normal
because this mask is so sticky
i tend to slop a lot on my foreh
it is definitely sticky
f you have dry skin issues
makes your skin look that way too
this moisturiser doesn't feel any greasy
well balanced for people with oily to combination skin like mine
has not dried out my skin either.
during the winter my skin can be a bit dull
it wasn't too much on my olive skin
you can wash it off along with the slight rosy smell that's due to the moisturizer the brown tint is a little unexpected
not oily at all
a little goes a long way-if it's white or like glue you are using way too much
especially if you're mixing it with another eye cream
although it leaves a very shimmery trail wherever you applied it
in which i can't rub off
this cleanser takes everything off my skin without drying me out
they mentioned in store that it's not meant to foam up big time because the ingredients break down makeup
soft without stripping my oil where i become too dry
i get like about 6 or 7 depending on if i put a thick or thin layer on
i find it lasts a long while too.
i feel like with most peel off masks i never use enough product
it is sticky and can get messy.
which then at times will leave texture in those areas when my skin is dehydrated
washed off whatever i couldn't get off
my oily skin must really like sake
this skin doesn't burn or irritate my skin while on
i love peel off masks--i think they really help with acne
it's great to use before make up because it leaves your skin feeling more prepared for the day
the only issue is that you do need a thick layer
t's less messy when you peel it off
didn't dry out my skin
doesn't leave the skin dry
this eye cream isn't even meant for my age or issues
this cream gives all day moisture i can feel to the touch
i let it soak in as much as i can
even feel confident enough to go out without the usual layers of concealer i was using
wait for it to absorb a bit
clog them up like other eye creams have done
no eye cream can help it
s then rub on your face
let it foam up in your h
you don't have to put much pressure onto your skin while you massage because the foam is doing most of the work
keep adding a little water from time to time during your cleanse
a tear free baby wash is really good for this
if you're skin is on the drier side try the other cleaner by belif for combination skin
love it as well for days when my skin is a little more dry
it has tea tree oil to help get rid of acne without drying out your face
trying to deal w my problematic skin
i also like that it just takes a very tiny bit of product to get a very nice thick lather on my face
another cleanser so that your skin does not get bored/tired of the formula
doesn't leave your skin dry
it will sting a bit if you use it to take off your waterproof eye makeup so just make sure you use something beforeh
this product does not dry out my skin
that may mean that your skin may become worse as all of the toxins are coming to the surface
powdering throughout the day is no longer a thing
it doesn't make it overly dry or tight at all
this is the first cleanser that actually makes my skin feel super clean without overly stripping it
if u have extremely oily tzone
after i rinse my skin just feels so frickin clean
if you use to much product it can get too foamy
then it stings really badly if you get any foam in your eyes or nose
it can be so hard to find a great moisturizer that won't break you out when you have acne
love that it has good ingredients they kept alot of junk chemicals out
it i do like the texture and formula
when you rub it over the face you'll experience the delightful
which tends to behave itself except in high-stress situations when i get very noticeable acne
it's cool to the touch against my face when i use it too
my skin can be oily/normal/dry on any given day
doesn't dry my skin out
i wanted something not drying
i don't have to worry about it spilling
doesn't dry the skin out
it doesn't make a lot of foam
it's also not entirely dry or oily.
it's a tad bit drying after you wash it off
in my opinion this mask does it all for my combination skin
when you apply the mask it begins to warm up on contact
because you can feel your pores opening up
by the way i have dry skin :)
it also wipes off easily which is always nice.
my skin is very agitated from trying a glycolic acid containing product so that is probably going to take more time to calm down
any dry patches were gone from my combination/sensitive skin
i like that it doesn't harden or dry making it comfortable to use for a longer period of time
a little too heavy for oily skin though in my opinion
i like applying it on my cheeks which are very dry
just the occasional whitehead here or there).
my routine is pretty drying
my foundation looks so much better throughout the day without any flakes or dry patches for it to grab onto
let me also mention that the painful throbbing of my acne is literally gone after i use this mask
it did once i went to wipe it off with my moist cotton round
i like that it didn't leave any residue.
i can't say much about softer skin since i'm normally oily anyways
i love this bc when you rub it on your face it immediately heats up
am too scared to use this on my face as it has a very viscous consistency
this stuff is awesome for any dry patches you may have
it honestly feels like putting honey on your skin--except you aren't left with a sticky feeling
it's a nice light mask that gives you some hydration without feeling oily or too much
this mask is the only thing that removed the dry dead skin
the way it turns into a creamy mask as you massage it into your face is so cool
the warming effect makes me feel like i'm at a spa
best way i use this: after a hot shower with my hair up in a towel
the warming sensation when you lather it into your skin is off putting initially
added perk: once the warm
whenever my dry patches return
the only thing i will say is don't put this on your face while its wet
it will burn instead of warm i think the water makes it spread
it won't turn white with water
if its too hot i would try just completely dry skin first
mostly because i can never find one that fits my dry/oily patchy combination skin
tingly when you are putting it on
just be ready for a little burn
a bit of a sticky mess upon first use
the best part: it doesn't break out my sensitive skin
it feels like your skin is just chugging water.
this always gets rid of flaky dry patches
don't just rub it in
it's really hard to find something that doesnt make my skin have a stinging sensation
at first i didn't think that it really gives me the moist
however when i washed it off with cold water
i rinse with cool water instead of warm when i take it off
it's gentle enough that it won't cause harmful affects if your skin really needs extra attention
just avoid eye area- it gets warm
i could really feel how warm it got on my skin
i always get flaky during the winter
if you are dry
if you are oily it will help balance
this mask it worth a try for oily
it can be irritating if you have sensitive skin
i recommend this to anyone with dry skin!
although it has salicylic acid in it it was not at all drying to the skin
this product did wonders for my dry skin!
i think the warmth may be too much for some
that there was real honey in it too
not over drying at all
which is a surprise because i always get super dry from salicylic acid
it does not dry out my skin too much
so far it was not drying on my face.
so my skin wasn't use to the climate there
i didn't notice that it has salicylic acid in it though
it doesn't dry my skin out too bad as long as i use a moisturizer
does not dry my skin at all
it doesn't dry my skin out
is not being dried out
searched what is good for my skin which is very dry
it's a gel so you only need a little
it doesn't dry out your skin
the only thing it does dry out your face a lot
it usually takes three nights to get rid of a pimple for me
it doesn't dry my skin out too much
it helps get rid of those really bad big ugly zits quickly without me having to pop it
it doesn't do too much for the smaller white heads or blemishes as much
i've also noticed that it tends to dry out that area for me
t creates mini dry patches on my skin if i don't moisturize well in the morning
downside is that it did dry my face out.
a little drying for my face everyday
it helps to dry up the blemish without making your skin overly dry
it does seem to heal any spots on my face pretty quickly
it's definitely helping on my pimples though it hasn't cleared them up overnight
i'd rather it smell the way it does than have fragrance added in because that can irritate sensitive skin
doesn't dry out my skin like some of the acidic stuff do
it doesn't leave a dry patch like most spot treatments i've used in the past
it doesn't feel cakey or break me out
ladies should never cheap out on skin care
doesn't dry it out at all
there's usually a decent amount of makeup residue left
it seems gets make up off better then the milk does
this does not strip your skin of any hydration which is a great thing
especially if you have sensitive or dry skin
so you should always start with some kind of remover
it gets all of the excess oil off
my recommendation is if you are skin like mine is to switch to a cleansing milk
this is perfect for when i wake up because my dry skin just soaks up the liquid
doesn't dry me out
i no longer suffer from gross flakey dry patches.
i could no longer hide with my face moisturizer.
it also doesnt feel greasy after application
about 10 minutes after i apply this my skin looks so much more plump
then i apply my other face oils on top
there's no more dry patches on my face.
when you first put it on it's like a thick lotion
wearing foundation everyday dries me out even more
yet of course i still continue to wear matte foundations
i didn't care for the applying with damp fingers.
when i use this product i have only been misting 1 or 2 times
i can go hours without re-adding moisture.
even though i'm combination normal to oily i feel there's times where my skin needs your hydration
after activating the emotion with water i can't believe how smooth
i am never dry and i have always been oily.
sometimes it tends to look very dull when i wake up
sometimes at night before my facial oil if my skin is extra dry
i find it really effective on dry patches
it targets my dry patches without making the oily parts of my face more oily
the smell is stronger than a facial cream would usually be
i picked this as one of my samples loved the results so much i know which areas on my skin are saggy
like i could literally feel my skin kind of plumping up after putting it on
i love that it cleans really well without drying out my skin
especially for people like me how dry out in the cold fall/winter months
it would be suitable to provide hydration to all skin types as it's not heavy or greasy
it sinks in like magic with just a bit of water
it definitely makes a difference in the moisture level of my skin
i wanted something non-oily to use as a clean
dry after they absorb despite putting on moisturizer afterwards
when you don't get enough water in your body
apply this on dry
i really stress on that
if you do too much water you'll rinse it off.
my blemishes have been coming down because my skin is getting the water that it needs
i don't like to use a lot of creams as i have a sensitive oily skin type
this did not irritate my skin at all!
which is a plus for me because i get turned off by super fragranced skin care products
was going to throw it away since i don't usually have good luck with moisturizers
when you apply this to your skin
add the water you can literally see
doesn't leave it sticky
it is not drying
it does get ur skin squeaky clean without stripping
cleanses my face very well without leaving it too dry
i tend to have super dry skin
i can develop dry flakes even in the summer
best face wash i've gotten so far!
as these products tend to dry out my sensitive
it works great and doesn't dry my skin.
makes you realize just how much residue of makeup one can have even after cleansing
one of the best things is when you add water it gets cloudy looking
the only reason for not getting five stars is it doesn't completely remove waterproof eyeliner which is a bummer
they either leave a residue or break me out
when you rinse the product off your skin does not feel like it has a film on it
takes off my make up very well without over drying my skin
you can either wash it off or take it off with a cotton pad
on my lazy days i do the cotton pad
during the day my skin doesn't get as oily as it use to which was very bad
my skin is typically really dry except for an oily t-zone
it's super hard for me to find makeup wipes/cleansing waters that won't burn my skin
also got ride of dryness
didn't dry out my skin
apply a very thin amount on my face
it didn't make me feel like a grease ball either
the serum left behind that you then rub into your skin is particularly good
i usually rub it in
needs a little more moisture in their life
that oily residue everyone is complaining about is a serum that is meant to be rubbed into the skin after the mask has been taken off
leaves face oily so no need to add anything else after
only thing i hated was that some of the mask goes through the kleenex
it doesn't leave any weird residue.
all of my other products soak in so easily
if there's residue left, you just rub that in.
if you don't wrap your magnet in tissue you're going to have a hard time getting the mask off it
the only thing i hated was the amount of tissue i had to use to get this mask off my face
better part is it didn't feel like it dried my face out like most do it actually left it very soft
i also like the no rinsing off part too.
fun to use and no need to wash it off.
i love this mask because there is no rinsing required
leaves enough of the softening ingredients on your face that you can still rub it in to continue the softening/plumping effect
someone with oily skin may not benefit from this.
i would definitely recommend using a paper towel or plastic wrap to cover the magnet because once there’s a bit of the mask on there it won’t come off
after you remove it it leaves a kind of serum that it tells you to rub into your skin
it makes your skin feel amazing until you wash your face again
this made my oily
you need very little to use as you put a thin layer on
what was on the tissue or cotton round to see if you could use it again
it made him more oily
we used our fingers instead of the spatula because it went on streaky with it
i normally prefer cloth masks because its easier then masks wash off type masks imo
what's great about this product is when you use the metal to get the magnet off you're left with no product on your skin
then you rub in whatever clear residue is left on your skin
once that's soaked in you're left with super soft skin
its not messy at all and easy to remove.
people with oily skin may not like this.
once you remove it with the magnet it leaves a nice silky residue that you massage into your skin which makes your skin feel so smooth
once you take it off it leaves a residue which i love
you will notice a soft yet kinda oily residue left on your skin
then know the residue is supposed to be a serum
i did still tissue off some of it
it leaves a nice serum on your face that you rub in afterwards
it left a light oil type deal on my skin that i rubbed in
i used the little spatula thing it came with
i would recommend this for dry skin.
if u have an oily skin type do a really good deep cleanse first as this is hydration extreme
it may seem "greasy" however
it's important to knowif you lose the magnetdo not rinse off with water or any liquidit will fuse to the skin making it extremely difficult to remove
just tissue off the best you can
again do not rinse off with water or any liquid
you definitely need to use the spatula to put this mask on your face
it kind of tickles when you remove it.
the skin is dry yet oily
after spending some time in the sun my skin can get really dry
s down the best moisture mask i have ever used
there was enough mixture in one mask mix for both my boyfriend
it does contain oils so couldn't use my loves
i think the result of weather
i find i need a thicker
so deep i couldn't even extract them
broken skin it'd leave me with if i could lessen the amount of bumps
i don't like scrubs daily even though those helped turn my skin over more than just washes
i find a little goes a long way whenever i use retinol to avoid over doing it
for the most part i have oily to combination skin during the summer
dry to combination in the winter
you could pump some into a travel bottle
i would probably prefer it to be less foamy
it doesn't leave any weird residue on the face.
it doesn't dry my skin out
can be drying if you use everyday
doesn't dry my skin out
which is essential for me since there are some nights that i forget/am too lazy to moisturize after
doesn't dry my skin out
definitely not dried out
very clean i recommend people with dry /sensitive skin this is the amazing product for you
doesn't make my skin dry
my face doesn't feel too dry or too oily.
ultimately i decided that it is a little too stripping on my dry skin
if you tend toward dryer skin
i always have a hard time finding a cleanser that deep cleans without being too harsh on my skin
i am always searching for that perfect cleanser that will clean your face without drying out
it is so gentle that i cannot promise wheather my face is cleansed enough at the end of day
someone may feel it is hard to rinse off
it is not drying
i still use micellar water to take my make up off
doesn't over dry my face either.
i wet my face and put a little in my hands.
combo-dry in the winter
when my skin isn't dry
it spreads nicely so you don't even need a full pump for your face
it dries out my skin too much
this was way too drying
i don't usually use foaming products because i have intensely dry skin
my t zone is like an oil slick
it did not over dry
which usually after cleansing they feel incredibly dry
not tight or dry
don't really have skin issues besides using some cleansers that make my face feel tight
if i strip my skin too harshly of the oil it becomes an oil slick
this face wash is so gentle yet effective.
i always go in with an oil balm to remove my make up
this does not make it feel dry or stripped when i'm done washing my face
i love the fact that this product does not have a lot of hard to pronounce-synthetic-chemicals in it
it dried my skin out too much
t may work better for you or in a more humid climate
it doesn't dry out my face
not dry out my face
does not dry out my face
not too dry or oily
no areas that feel tight or dry afterwards
all they did was irritate my skin
doesn't dry out my skin
it is just a little drying
when i use this product i feel that my skin becomes very clean
not some hard plastic
doesn't dry out my face at all
i do love it for the times my face needs to feel extra clean versus the jelly-type cleanser i use normally
this cleaned my face well without irritating it
it won't strip you where you feel your skin more dry or tight
sometimes i have to use extra eye make up remover if i have heavy eye make up on
usually my skin can get quite dry in some areas
yet oily as well
usually i would just stop using a product if it caused that much irritation to my skin
hopefully this will get me through the rough winter winds
it is drying if your not using serum
without having the bad chemicals like other washes
it doesn't leave my skin dry
doesn't dry my skin out
i wouldn't recommend this for dry skin.
first of all i have to say that i have super dry skin
this doesn't dry me out or leave my skin tight after it's washed
skin--especially in the summer when your face tends to melt off
doesn't leave my face sticky or shiny
add the farsali gold elixir in it at night for that extra moisture
it caught my eye because of the natural ingredients in it
it comes with a little spatula to help scoop out the very last bit of it when the time comes
which i looove in the summer months when i don't need as much hydration
it got rid of a dry patch i'd been trying to get rid of for ages
usually the day after i go out i'll get a zit or 2
still very hydration without going overboard
it did not make my face oily or dry my skin out
since i have dry skin it is definitely not enough for the midwestern winter
this stuff is seriously liquid gold to me.
it comes with a little scoop that i use to get it out of the jar
i normally don't like to spend this much on face cream
it has no oily or tacky feeling at all
its light on the skin and doesn't leave me shiny.
on my dry days i use a more heavy duty moisturizer at night because i don't think this would cut it for dry skin
didn't notice any grease from it
it does a good job at giving extra moisture
doesn't make the skin feel oily or slick
not oily or heavy
non greasy just right
over an hour or so you could literally fry an egg on my face it gets so oily
at first i thought this would be too thin fir my winter skin
i don't think it will make my skin oily
this doesn't aggravate it
even in this dry wisconsin winter weather
so finding a moisturizer that treated my dry skin without breaking me out proved to be very tricky
a lot of moisturizers are either too much in my oily spots or not enough for my dry patches
if i use any other creme instead then my makeup always seems to be cakey
i don't typically like lotions/creams because i have so many already at home that do not work with my skin
doesn't really hold up to dry winter skin
doesn't leave my skin looking oily
it has done wonders for balancing my combination of oily skin with horrid dry patches
moisturizes during the cold winter months without making me break out
my face used to be so dry
my face is no longer an oily mess
it was a nice relief in the drying winter weather
it doesn't feel oily
it does this without feeling heavy or greasy
my skin is not extremely dry so maybe for drier
i appreciate that this hydrates my skin without being too heavy
not only is it dry as a desert
when i put make up on i finally don't see it with the flakes of dryness underneath
this is cooling on the skin after i do some masks that get warm on my face
i do feel like this helps to moisturize my skin without making it look oily
does not leave a greasy finish
it is lightweight so your skin doesn't feel sticky after applying
not greasy at all
i like the fact that this comes with a little plastic spatula so that i can scrape every last bit of cream out of the jar
doesn't leave you feeling greasy or oily
so my skin is normal/dry will def be more on the dry side with winter coming
i will most likely have to add a few drops of the drunk elephant marula oil with it at night once it gets colder
didn't irritate my skin at all so far
just the fact that it absorbs so quickly
while not feeling heavy or clogging
or making my face greasy or oily
it didn't get rid of my dark spots completely
it really calms my skin down when i use it consistently
it's a little hard to spread over dry skin because it absorbs so quickly
i added the face wash into the mix too.
the fact that it doesn't soak into your skin right away
for anyone saying it feels cakey
the only thing i don't have is dry skin
the pump may spray the stuff with more force than you think
i just wish they had it in a shade lighter
i just wish it came in a lighter shade because this summer glow isn't going to last very long
at first i tried using it like a foundation because i've been caking stuff onto my cheeks my whole life
regardless if there is heat during the summer or harsh cold wind during the winter
not oily at all
i definitely don't need a powder or different foundation on top
it also doesn't feel cakey as when i have foundation on
i don't need to wear foundation or powder on top of this
i realized it does this weird thing with my nose pores
where it kinda acts like the glamglow clearing treatment
tends to dry very quickly
honestly i felt like it minimized my pores as well
i am able to use a very light layer of bb cream or foundation that balance it out
was awkward to blend since it dries pretty quickly
my only gripe about that was it had to be set with some translucent powder or else it would get oily on you
i can see where it might get "cakey" on dry skin
then i use the little brush that i got when i first ordered this product elsewhere to buff it evenly over the skin
it's thick so you have to be careful to apply very little
the only downfall is i can look dryer in the areas applied
rarely do i ever wear just a cream with no powder foundation on top
on lazy days this could be worn alone
best of all it does not melt off my face when i blow my nose or walk outside in the florida humidity
the shade will probably be too dark if you have extremely fair skin
it does seem to match better on my "summer" skin shade
i just wish they'd offer a lighter shade
after using this product my skin is no longer red or oily
is not thick at all
please make this in a tube like your foundations
the dry skin that comes with it
coverage either has to be so thick that i look like i have fake skin
i can never find something that doesn't enhance dry patches
it didn't dry me up or enhance any dry patches
just a dab of this will cover my whole face.
if i use too much it can be cakey once my foundation is applied
i recommend not sticking a bigger/fluffier brush into the jar bc it would pick up way too much product
just don't like that it can settle or look like your skin is cracking if you are covering bad rosacea
i can't wear full coverage make up to work since it gets really hot in a kitchen
it's been really hard to find products to minimize the redness in order for makeup to look how it's suppose to
i add this on around those areas with my beauty blender to be sure it is spread evenly
a small amount gives me enough coverage on my whole face to hide redness
if you use more than a small dab
nothing will cover those tomatoes up!
i’m not a fan of the extra step to wet it
dry it because there is no sink near my makeup table
once you blend it out it covers all the red
that's because you literally need the smallest amount to cover problem areas
the definition of "use sparingly" for me is to put some on my face or brush that's so small i can hardly see it
also find it is drying.
some days i'm just too lazy to put on makeup
i can never leave my house without wearing foundation because my cheeks
either the color was off or the texture was wrong
unlike the usually sticky green stuff
which makes my skin feel like it still can breathe throughout the day
it doesn't give you the weird white cast that greens tend to give
my super sensitive skin doesn't respond well to many anti-aging serums which is very frustrating because i need them
just in the hopes they might help my wrinkly skin
my eyes did not burn
this did not make my tzone oilier.
it was still hard to get my roller lash mascara off with it
you are just not going to do multiple steps because you are taking off your waterproof stage makeup at 5am while your drunk
it's better to keep face clean than to worry bout the smell
then leaving it on skin for anywhere from 1-10 minutes to really act as a deep moisturizing treatment
others require scrubbing or make your face feel yucky
my face doesn't feel tight or dry
it doesn't leave my skin oily afterwards
you better use a spoon or something to get the product when using
doesn't leave any residue
it gets it off with no hassle
i do wish it had a spatula because it almost has a consistency of coconut oil
it will make you foggy visioned if you do not rinse well
even if you have oily skin!
they always got my skin very dry even though i have oil skin
a lot of the jar is just thick plastic i think to make it look bigger which is we just size up by the eye looks like more product
i fully expected it to leave my face greasy
avery small amount leaves my face perfect for my night cream
i am never going back to a liquid!
it really works great at taking off my stubborn mascara as well as the rest of the layers of product on my skin
it literally melts the makeup off just like it says it will
i hate sticking my fingers in any type of pot product
once you've broken up the make up on the face you rinse
you literally rub it all over your face
the cotton pad was pretty much clean
just as an excuse to wash my face with it
i don't even need to rinse with hot water to remove it
that does not have the mild cleansing power like this does
i live i a very dry climate
thoroughly cleanses because i still get occasional breakout
sometimes a little on a cotton swab as needed in the am
it does seem to leave a slight residue once i wash it off
i remove it with a warm
i love that you don't have to wet your face before applying
no need to rub hard
didn't dry my skin out.
just rub it in
i like to wash it off with warm water
oily feel, but doesn't leave your skin oily.
it doesn't seem to really get my skin super clean
all of my make up is waterproof
you can wash it off
i would have to use it twice to completely get rid of my mascara
i didn't use it on my cheeks or skin other than my eyes just because i use a face wash for that
it really does wash off with warm water leaving no residue
even the hardcore eye makeup ill throw on occasionally it just melts it away
you have to fight your instincts to put water on
every single one i've tried leaves a greasy film on my skin
t doesn't burn when i use it on my eyes or irritate my skin in any way
the best part is that it doesn't make my skin feel greasy after use or leaves a film on my face
i won't be without this staple in my skin care line up
bought this the other day after trying every primer under the sun for my large pores
squeeze tube combo makes it so easy to get product out
if you are not super oily
beyond sensitive eyes that water at the slightest sensitivity don't work for me
i've found this primer to be the perfect amount of hydration without being slippery
it doesn't break up or get cakey like it used to
this primer is amazing it does the job by getting rid of all your pores
doesn't make my face look dry
i will start by saying i have oily skin.
make sure to let this primer soak into the skin a little bit
very hard to find the perfect primer that won't break me out or dry me out
i do not have oily skin
if you get a white residue you've used too much !
the primer worked wonders for my oily areas as well as my dry
when it comes in contact with sunlight things could get bad
it makes my puffiness go away in a matter of minutes
i find it a tiny bit cooling when i apply
there is no sting or burn when i apply this product
one piece of advice i have is either put this on first or wash your h
(yes, i used it on my lids too!)
until i used this eye cream i realized how dehydrated my undereyes were even though i used other eye creams everyday
dry winter weather meant i couldn't skip the step
whenever i set my under eye area with translucent powder or even if it was just foundation it would always crease into those lines no matter what i did
i do not use this cream before putting makeup on i notice it makes my eyes crease a lot more
gets rid of any fine lines.
my make up removing routine is now much more gentle
dont rub it on your eye
it doesn't break me out, or dries out my skin.
once it dries by under eyes actually feel dry
it's like a fresh pressed juice for your skin.
my undereye area also happens to be perpetually dry
nice thick cream and you only need a little bit.
it is so thick that you barely see it with any other eye cream
it doesn't like run into my eyes which is what i usually encounter with most eye creams
this is now my favorite moisturizer the only down side it that it is very thick
it's never too early to start a skin care regime
have struggled to find a moisturizer that doesn't break me out
the rest of my face would be dry
feels like a later or cast in your skin
it is not greasy at all
you do have to wait for this to settle into your skin before doing makeup or it can get slippery
it can get super hot
doesn't leave it greasy
i needed a decent moisturizer to tide me over until i could purchase a full size of something
i've struggled for years to find a moisturizer that actually gets into the skin
this stuff has changed my dry skin.
doesn't leave you oily or feeling clogged.
'm not sure it would work for oily skin
i've never been able to find anything that has really helped my skin cracking or my burns
i dont even have dry skin
its not too heavy on the skin
my face is so dry, /('~')\i peel at occasion.
left just enough for all day moisture
i live in a very dry
cold place where the weather is unpredictable
if the scent bothers you drink tea make it hot let the steam hit your eyes before you apply
left it matte after application which is great because my skin can get oily/dry
i never feel greasy
it can be difficult for me to find a moisturizer that is thick enough to last the day/night without my skin literally itching for another application without it feeling heavy/greasy
as i could tell it was thicker
it also still didn't feel heavy despite how thick it is
diminished any flaky appearance i would have normally had after setting my makeup with my setting powder
my face is so dry i normally use 25% shea
some sit on my skin
it will cover your whole face
this is perfect when i need a kick of moisture.
it's been extra dry from the cold weather lately
have finally found something that actually moisturizers my dry winter flakiness without aggravating my sensitive
this cream relieves those dry patches immediately without breaking me out or making any spots worse
it does not make skin greasy.
has really helped my skin deal with this cold weather
my skin can get so dry
not dry or overly oily
my skin is more on the dry side during the winters
it does have a slight greasy feel once applied yet quickly melts into the skin
i tend to alternate products at night based upon how my skin feels after washing
in the winter can have dry patches
no oily or sticky feeling.
i started using this cream because any other product i used made my face oily
i already have an oily face.
does not feel greasy during the day
drier air comes around i will use a
it doesn't make my face greasy by the end of the day
i wear this under all of my foundations because i need a heavier moisturizer for my makeup to "melt" into my dry skin
if you're concerned with looking oily at all
then a little powder will take care of the oil for the rest of the day
we both have dry skin
dont feel like it just rubs off on my pillow when i go to bed
there are no dry patches anymore
i also use this on my very dry face.
it kind of get oily like an hour after you apply
the cream is thick consistency so you don't have to use a lot per use
it is amazing for those dry patches around the nose i have had my entire lifetime
s quite a bit to warm up the product before application
this should not be used as a moisturizer unless you live in a very cold climate
in hotter climate its great on my dry patches.
if you use too much it will smother your face in a greasy way in a hot climate
also doesn't leave my already oily skin a wet mess
it doesn't make it oily
use the cream on my extremely dry spots
a bit of redness once i put this on i feel like my skin can breath
even out the skin
feels like it would be way to heavy for oily skin
my tzone is no longer oily
it's tight but not drying what so ever.
this past winter my skin has never been so dry dull
to deal with my dry skin
does leave a little extra shine
probably nothing a setting powder wouldn't fix.
anytime your skin is red
it heals up acne crazy fast even when i've picked them
also used it for extreme dryness on his h
this stuff its amazing if you have oily
if you do have oily skin
less it more or it will grease up doing the day
my skin was peeling like never before
in the beginning it left my skin super oily
as my skin got use to it it became less oily
am only going to use this when my skin is red
even keep my oily skin in check
wouldn't use this alone as primary moisture
this stuff is amazing for when you have a chapped nose from a cold
more dry than anything
my skin would get all dry
i didn't realize how irritated my skin was until the tiger grass cream began soothing it
however, i get very shiny after application.
did not cause any breakouts since i even used it around my nose
oily skinned people might want to avoid this tho
it can feel just a little oily
which can be hard with the cold dry air we have this time of year
now the cold winter has come
i love the metal bar thing that comes with this cream making it easier to roll this tube up
no heavy oils either
do tend to add a drop of one of my favorite essences just to help out a bit
the essence helps to spread out the product without too much tug on the skin
since starting this cream i rarely ever get dry patches anymore
especially around my nose my skin always gets so dry in the winter
when the colder months come i get very dry
it doesn't stay on thick like neosporin would
my skin would turn greasy
as the weather got colder
this alone was not enough to keep my skin moisturized in the wind
i wouldn't recommend this as a daytime moisturizer unless your skin is at an otherworldly level of dry
my skin has been dry enough that i didn't want to use a spot treatment on those breakouts
highly recommend if you have dry skin.
this cream only takes 2 days to complete dry it up
everything that you need in a cream in cicapair tiger grass cream
if you're into facial oils like myself this is a good base for an oil
i felt like this cream would break me out for it is bit sticky
moisturizing enough for all of my dry areas everywhere else as well
next day after that my acne was pretty much flatten
doesn't feel oily when you apply it
even though the cream is very thick i don't feel overly greasy or oily which is surprising
i like how thick it is because it stays on
everything either wasn't enough moisture
did nothing for the dry patches
was starting to get even more dry
don't be put off at how thick it is.
how it feels on my skin after applying my clarin's double serum
thick although there isn't any sticky feeling after application
it doesn't feel heavy or greasy like some creams do
love how the hydration really sinks into the skin instead of just sitting on top
i extract them which leaves unpleasant marks all over
the ones that claim to get rid of my acne dries out my skin so bad
these products have literally cleared up every imperfection on my face plus my skin feels amazing
honesty you could wear a light coverage foundation or powder foundation on top of this
it can be a bit oily
actually feel good about what i am putting on my face knowing it won't clog my skin or take hard cleansers to remove
have thought that caking on foundation was the only way to have beautiful skin
at least i have a "makeup" that doesn't make my face look cakey or fake
doesn't feel overly heavy or make me too shiny in the florida humidity
dry it has saved me with its spf
this might look a little ashy or off
will kind of coat your skin afterwards
it does get a little cakey around the nose
chin if you have dry skin
i noticed it did make my skin a little oily
considering that i have oily skin
you can always use an oil blotting sheet in the middle of the day
just don't use it as a replacement for your morning moisturizer as it can be a little drying
unless i caked it on like a saturday night party which is not natural or optimal for work or day time use or i found i spent tons of money changing product to product when i realized it really didn't look good on me
money on my skin
so even though the jar is expensive
especially in the summer heat
unless you only put a very small amount it makes the face extremely oily
products often make me look washed out because i don't spend any time outside to get an actual tan
then just make sure you always apply a layer on top to restore your natural skin tone
can only apply a small amount on my face otherwise it tends to get pretty dry in some areas
if you want a very light color corrector for everyday this is for you
that is my skin base then i will add blush
i don't feel a bit of grease from the product or oil from my face
make me super oily
it doesnt give me a green cast so on low maintainence days
it's definitely something that needs to be washed off
the drying wasn't nearly as bad when i did so.
since you should be washing it off anyway
as it will leave you a bit shiny after application
don't want to have to wear a full coverage foundation just cover the redness- especially during the humid summer months in the south
i like this product as a quick even out before tinted moisture
i would say that his is best suited for dry skin.
live in la where the air/extra sweat in the hot months have really messed with my skin
can really only use this when my skin condition is good because it does emphasize dry flakes/spots since it's matte
it can even dry out blemishes
if it's dry it gets red.
i only use concealer if i have a zit or on my dark circles if i know i'll be in a lot of pictures
you do have to let it soak in your skin a little before applying more product to the face
it does wash me out slightly
say it works fine with me liquid foundation
throughout the day i notice that my skins doesn't get as red as it usually does as my foundation fades
i prefer to use it as a moisturizer/primer when i am doing a fresh look as opposed to a full face
can clean it out
i don't use much to cover my redness so this tub will last me a long time
it didn't feel greasy, sticky.
or juice beauty work well for my skin anyway as far as moisture needs go
i honestly thought putting a green moisturizer on my face would not work out well
doesn't turn in to an oil slick
all i need to do after is brush on powder foundation for coverage
i started using this with the hope that it could help with my redness--i don't wear loads of make-up
it feels like the moisturizer is really sinking into your skin rather than settling on top
i don't like to wear thick foundation to cover it
i only had one dry spot on my forehead so for me not really a problem
im rating it a 4 because it can make your face look pretty dewy
just add an oil or heavy moisturizer before applying the product with your fingers
since it tends to clump up around dry areas if you don't
it gets dewy throughout the day but not oily.
i didn't expect to like the cream since it seemed pretty heavy in the jar
towards the end of the day it does get a little oily
sometimes i don't even put foundation on over it because my skin looks
it can look a little cakey at times
when you have fair skin you have to press the product into your skin do not rub it in
has spf making me feel better about going out for a day in the sun
it does dry kind of shiny looking
it also doesn't leave my skin greasy.
as well as something of a greasy feel when you wash it off
it definitely does that without drying out my face
at least it didn't give me nasty dry patches
for me that just feels like moisture
i will keep it dry
if you wash it off well with cold water
which is perfect for my dry
be careful though if it gets into your eye it burns
wash your hands good before using this product.
you don't have to use any cotton rounds or anything to rub it on
the oily feel does a great job at breaking down even the most stubborn waterproof mascara
i inevitably have to double cleanse to get it all off which really dries out my skin
but not with this amazing oil balm!
i don't usually splurge on cleansers since they don't stay on the skin very long
i find it does leave a bit of a residue if you don't use a washcloth to remove it
nothing a little micellar water can't take off
i do that then wet my h
even the lash glue that can take a few passes normally
sticky when you first apply it because you don't get it wet at first
it also gets everything clean without drying out your skin
when you rub this all over your face
it will feel greasy at first
even if you have oily skin like i do
you won't really see the results until after you wash the balm off with warm-to-hot water
just be sure to really rub it in before washing it off
it still leaves a film on your face so you need to go over it with cleanser which i think resulted in additional irritation of my skin
and it's not liquid so easy to carry around.
i hate the feeling of putting more "oil" on it
this product didn't have the oily feeling.
the reason it's a 4 star is because it did not remove all my waterproof mascara like it claimed to do
i do wash my face with my usual facewash
it doesn't sting or irritate at all
i do find that it leaves a bit of oily residue
once i added a little water like the instructions said the mascara was gone
it doesn't leave an oily or greasy finish either
your skin does not feel oily after or have a build up
if you've never used a balm before you have to realize it will go on sticky
even with clinique's balm it promises your face will be make up free after
this balm will literally strip every ounce of make up off your face
this must go on a dry face
your face wash routine should not be fast
you need to take your time cleansing your skin
took my bush ans try to clean to see if there was any residue
definitely melts all of my make up away
it was easy to wash off with water.
i like the way it feels without a soap -- so soft
i used a cotton pad with my tonic water to see if any make up is there
its so easy to remove my make up now
it really does melt your makeup so quickly
not even the least bit oily
best part is the fact that i don't have to rinse off
gents this is a nice effective way to remove make up first thing first is know your skin type when taking off make up you have to have a skin care routine double cleaning that means you use something else before your face wash
i can see the makeup melting down like it said bc you have to warm the product up in order for it to do its magic after i worked it around for 2 minutes yes my face was "greasy "
not in a bad was in a way that looked you just rubbed around your make up once i add a lil bit of water on my finger tips it was visible that the make was coming off
bc it kept the moisture i needed in my face so once i washed with my face wash i didn't have a tight dry feeling or use that
didn't leave any residue
doesn't overly dry out my skin after
if this didn't dry out my skin after using it i'd give it 5 stars
even when i tone afterwards there's no left over makeup on the cotton pad
my friends tease me that i wear so little makeup that i don't need an extra step of a melt away to clean my skin
i do usually have extremely oily skin
in the winter months it settles out to a more of a combo skin type
i recommend this to anyone who has dry skin
i like this one more because it doesn't leave a greasy film on contacts like the clinique one does
this does not irritate or inflame my skin
better than typical face wash
i like it because unlike other balms it comes off easly with water
glory the water needs to be real hot to get that oily residue off
it actually ecourages a little water to really emusify it
add water to get it "milky" then go right into washing it all off with a cleanser
it really melts it all off before you use your actual facial cleanser
this product can take it all off with no work or harsh scrubbing
they will dry me out
it's not drying at all.
don't find it drying at all
i put a little warm water after i massaged it into my face thorougly
does not dry out your skin
this huge tub will last you forever.
some felt too oily or dried out my face
and nothing actually exfoliated until this one!
it in on a dry face
it does have a bit of an herbal natural charcoal smell that did not bother me at all
really does melt off everything
it's a non-messy way to wash your face at the end of the day
it has become my total ride or die make up remover
wipes aren't strong enough to do the job
clinique take the day off balm irritated my skin after just one use
it doesn't irritate my eyes at all
this not only moisturized enough to get rid of any dryness
i don't really believe in splashing so after washing my face instead of towel drying i press it onto my face with wet h
let it air dry
also really great for right after a peel or acne masks that really dry me out
i can pat a pump of this directly from the bottle onto my face after a shower or washing my face
let it air dry
always let it air dry either way.
however, this is too oily for my face.
my skin in the winter gets so!
i do not pat my face dry
i rub around the wetness a little bit on my face
in the morning i mix a little into my regular moisturizer so my makeup can glide on smooth
you can imagine what condition my skins in
this thing has done miracles for me when waking up with dry irritated skin
this winter has made it even worse as i can't wear any makeup without it looking extremely cakey
then pump a small amount into my wet h
every time i get out the shower if i go too long without moisturizing right out the shower
my face gets super dry
i just used one pump because i have sensitive skin
i'll just get out shower
just let air dry
t's hard to get that glow without looking greasy
the first time i used it i was wondering if 2 pumps was enough for a big basin of water
let my face air dry
the way i use it is after my shower i dont dry my face
it literally takes like 30seconds if not less for the mask/oil to dry
a must-have for anyone who deals with dryness/dry patches
even though i used the scrub to get rid of them it wouldn't go away
i usually like the skin care from boscia
and have to use the mask while your face is wet.
the most important thing is it got rid of dry patches
this is wonderful if your skin is going through a rough patch or it's the dead of winter
i've found that on extremely dry days
a little goes a long way over damp skin
have used pretty much every anti-aging cream
thinking another greasy cream doing nothing
it doesn't leave my face greasy like other products
it doesn't irritate my eyes at all
was a little worried it wouldn't be hydrating enough
it is also the first time this winter that my face hasn't felt too dry
i don't know about skin lifting or wrinkle reduction
it might be too heavy for use when it gets warmer
it's perfect for my dry winter skin
not at all greasy or oily
some very dry other parts very oily
after applying this i feel my face smoother with no dry spots
i can get quite dry
never have i felt a cream so light
never seem to be able to find a firming moisturizer that doesn't feel heavy when i wear makeup
it is the only face cream i have found that can nourish my sensitive
i mean all skin types
even texture is what i get with this
there are also no ingredients that are irritating to the skin or unstable
since my skin is on the oilier side i wear this only at night
for drier skin types it would be suitable as a day cream as well
the skin sucks it up like water in a dessert
if you're have a normal skin tone
you can feel a slight residual left on your face
i no longer have any dry patches in my t zone
it is a true savior on winter nights too where your skin just gets depleted of all moisture while you're sleeping with the heat on
don't have to apply too many layers before i start putting on my foundation etc
no matter how hard i try to moisturize in the winter
make it part of my skin care routine
it has an organic smell which puts me at ease knowing that it isn't filled with perfumes simply to please a picky nose
was finding it wasn't doing the trick in the cold harsh climate
i am always fighting with dry skin especially in the winter
it is so nice to have finally found products that combat my dry
it does not linger on.
everything i tried was either too greasy
even in dry winter weather
i don't find it to be overly greasy or heavy like a lot of night creams i've tried are
which is where i'm assuming they got their "pungent" sample from
it was not greasy
if you apply the right amount the product will settle into your skin just fine
it reminds me of dry grass on a summer day when you're laying in the grass
doesn't leave a sticky/oily residue like many of the br
i do recommended if you have oily or combo skin
my skin didn't feel oily or greasy at all
i could feel the product on my skin
i love how it doesn't leave my skin oily
does the job well for my very dry skin.
even oil free products will occasionally break me out
i feel it on my skin all day
ter when my skin needs extra moisture at night
a little bit goes a long way with this melt!
when i wake up my dry patches don't look flaky
definitely worth it if you have dry skin!
that gets even worse during the freezing minnesota winters
this product has solved my dry skin issues that even argan
lxmi balm-to-oil doesn't break me out
because it takes a bit of time to completely sink into the skin
it worked wonders on my dry skin.
it is a great formula because it holds in the moisture with out being too greasy or oily
dry climates or just when my skin needs some love
i can put this on any dry/red patches on my face
i feel like most heavy night creams are barely suitable for day time for me
they just seem to slip off as i sleep
t was a little "thick" for me by itself
body even if you have oily skin
it does not leave behind an extra greasiness
i would recommend this balm to basically anyone with skin
but folks with dry skin are going to love it!
burned skin wayyy beyond what any after-sun cream has ever done for me
any dry areas i have on my face
i actually found that it made my under-eye area drier initially
i love how cool the applicator feels against my tired eye area
will save my dry skin
i highly recommend it if you have dry sensitive skin like me
i still do get a bit of flakiness on my face
they feel really heavy or greasy on the skin
it doesn't completely soak in
radiant as if winter doesn't exist
can occasionally break out with heavy face creams
not greasy for the winter
it really is a dry skin saver.
not oily which is great
doesn't make skin greasy mid day
just as dr perricone says he doesn't put any irritating scents in his products which is better for your skin
i love that it has everything you need in 1 product plus hydration for the cooler winter months
i only used a tiny amount as i have oily skin
then would start to make the skin look very dull
it doesn't linger for long
now i'm gonna have to buy the big bottle because this stuff is liquid gold
if you want something for moisture
it doesn't dry out my skin which is another plus
my skin is not as red any more
it is not too thick or too runny
it is not sticky or heavy at all
didn't dry it out
cleans the make up off my eyes so that i really look like a raccoon until i wash it off
because i have oily skin
i guess if you had dry skin
it's the only oil based product that hasn't also dried my skin
i don't know if this would be good for oily skin as it does add moisture
it isn't leaving dry
it goes on like a light oil
you know how if you wash your makeup off in the shower you walk out with raccoon eyes
then lathered with some water just like the directions
your more than welcome to use a facewash after for an extra clean
feels even better on my skin once i've washed everything off
my skin has been a little is drier than it used to be
i love that you add water to it to transform it
it starts as an oil on dry skin
then you wet your fingers
that don't make my oily areas even greasier
it might be a little heavy for daytime for those with oily skin
i wake up with much better skin
it isn't as oily or as dry any more
i would recommend it to people who need a little more moisture or a thicker face cream
too much can feel heavy
this is very thick, but not greasy at all.
can't say this mask is completely the reason for my skins glow
does not dry me out
that the mask was specifically designed to dry with these dark spots to make you think it was extracting these impurities
i absolutely love that i can see these impurities because it gives me a gauge on how my skin is doing
sooooo good without being drying like a normal clay mask
because i can put it all over my face without it over-drying the dry parts
clay masks do wonders for me
even as you are rinsing the hardened clay off you can feel how incredibly smooth your skin is about to be
i find the other creams from the line can be a little to heavy on my skin
not greasy at all
the cleansing oil did not impress me.
i felt i had to apply too much pressure to clean off my mascara
i decided to switch up my skin care routine for the summer because i started to notice my pores getting bigger
bought this on the first night i couldn't really tell it did much to my skin i would say the product definitely has a little bit of a learning curve for the makeup remover you have to truly massage this product in to the face to fully have your makeup removed
the oil really does take off a full face
the rice powder does take some getting used to
the rice powder we found works well if you s
couldn't seem to find anything to address oiliness
not greasy at all in my tzone
the cleansing oil at first felt too greasy
it doesn't make my skin feel dried out nor greasy
the cleansing oil i like to use when i'm feeling lazy
it doesn't leave a film after washing it off
no oily or greasy feel
just enough to help life the dead skin
the camelia cleansing oil i could take or leave
the powder doesn't make my face feel dry after using
t left it a bit dry
i recommend this to anyone scared of using oils to clean
it doesn't exfoliate enough to trouble shoot this
i would recommend the rice powder to anyone looking to refresh their skin that they're mostly happy with
the powder enzyme is super good after the oil there is actually a lotion as described on sephora online it's just all the way in side the gift box it's literally a sample comes in one of those pouch sample super small it's not in a jar
true to the name its very gentle you can choose to wipe it off or wash it off
can also be used for a leave-in treatment for your hair
yes the product does harden just like normal coconut oil
if you already have deep wrinkles or you're a particular age
breakout prone skin i was always hesitant to use an oil on my face
it doesn't leave any oily residue at all
however not leave greasy residue
the only problem i have is that it gets stuck in my beard because it is a hard area to moisturize
even works well with hot, humid weather.
i worried about it being greasy
like it may take several minutes to rub it
there is no greasy finish
i can get dry skin easily when these breakouts happen
typically, i am very oily.
didn't want to splurge on a face cream that would over load my skin
still wanted to load my skin with moisture this stuff was the ticket
you should apply a healthy layer that you still see the cream on your face after you apply
it didn't feel good on my dry skin
does not feel sticky or greasy
sometimes i will rinse it with water in the morning
not day given how thick
white i can leave on your face
i don't rub it in.
t may harden more if left in it
doesn't leave you with oily residue afterwards
i truly have tried everything for my dry skin.
i went into sephora because i had a dry patch that try would not go away with all the moisturizing
i can still feel the lotion on my face as if i had just put it on
ladies please warm between fingers to warm the product up then pat on face
very dry skin it is salvation for you
my super dry skin drank this heaven right up.
so i just applied this cream right over it.
your skin will drink it up
my face will momentarily become more flushed when i apply any product
i don't rub this in.
this cream is the first that i've tried that not only doesn't further irritate my skin
so you only need a minimal amount for your whole face/neck area
my face is usually extremely oily in the t-zone areas
actually made my face more oily
especially as the weather gets colder
i also lather it on my 4 month old as it was the only thing that worked for his hyper sensitive dry excema skin
it feels thick when i put it on
the result is i often have a broken down moisture barrier on my face which results in extremely dry skin
while it didn't irritate my skin
i didn't want to be coated in it
desparately searching for the one that would provide the perfect amount of moisture yet still not make me shiny/greasy or breakout
this container will literally last me forever because i only have to use the tiniest bit
have not come across anything else that hydrates my skin like pure
might feel a bit heavy
your skin will drink it all up pretty quickly
since it's rather on the thicker side i use it at night after my serum
before bed for a healing effect i like to take this with a few drops of drunk elephants marula oil
you're eyes get dry
didn't expect much more than moisture
glow-y my skin has been in the morning even when i use only this cream alone
sometimes clogged tzone skin loves this stuff
it doesn't break me out or make my oily skin even more oily
felt dry due to the winter air
picked this up in hopes that it could moisturize well
sometimes it is difficult to open a jar
this cream seems to keep them at bay
it does not burn the eyes.
this takes care of that without leaving my skin oily
doesn't make my skin break out
they either make me break out or aren't moisturizing enough
with enough moisture to make my skin feel great
while it seems counterintuitive to clean wil oil to battle oily skin
don't be afraid of it being an "oil" because my skin hates oils
my t zone is less oily throughout the day
it's really watery so a lot of it goes to waste when you try to pour it into your h
there is an oil you use then the soap.
aids the soap in deep cleaning however it can not be used alone in my opinion
if you follow this regimen you will not have flaky skin
thought it was going to be oily
together they leave my skin so smooth
it really gets you squeaky clean used without the oil
leaves you not stripped/dry if you use directly after putting water on the oil
i noticed that after using the soap of bar does not leave a wet mess
is when i have eyeliner on my waterline because you must keep your eyes closed
i know thats a given however when i would get just a little in my mouth it was a very strong nasty taste that would take a while to wash it out
the taste was still very much there even when i tried washing my mouth out well with water
make sure you use a generous amount of the cleansing oil as it directs because thats what helps it not strip your face when you combine the cleansing bar with it
you apply that to a dry face
the oil is not greasy
i felt like you need a good moisturizer afterwards to make up for the squeakyness
i like to use this in this shower since rinsing my face off after is harder for me to do in the sink after using a bar soap
simply apply the oil to your face
then wet the bar
it does not dry out my roseacea prone skin either
the "oil" is not really oily at all in my opinion
once you use that on dry skin
you can feel the little grains of something in there when you apply the bar of soap to your face so make sure you apply the bar directly to your skin
when you're done washing your face
like you can literally feel that your pores are clean
the only thing i don't like is that it is a little drying
going into the winter i need lots of moisture
could see myself using this more during the colder/dryer months
i usually have normal to dry skin so this really helps take away the dryness
rinse away anything that might be left over
i don't enjoy t as much in the outer areas of my skin
this one helps rid of my oily
you apply that to a dry face
so anything that helps cleanse my skin is a automatic plus for me
its pretty simple add the cleansing oil to your dry face
next up you wet and lather the bar.
i actually use this in the shower
which i think causes less mess
i typically use a regular face wash that you squeeze out of a tube
it's more like a face wash than an oil
i also feel like it really exfoliates because you use the bar directly on your face
whenever i finish cleansing my face with both the oil
does not dry out my skin
a big concern for me in the cold weather
i wasn't to sure how i felt about applying a cleansing oil being that my skin is super oily
i still get oily throughout the day
thanks to influenster i was able to try this product on my post baby oily skin
i think the combo would work better for someone whose skin isn't as dry as mine is
it basically dried it out without leaving my face overly dry like some cleansers
not dry in the slightest
it has somewhere to drain if it's wet
having to use two different products to wash your face seems mundane
i could only use this product twice a week because it was a little to drying on my skin for everyday use
i usually stay away from facial soaps because they always strip my face of nature oil
didnt even feel like i needed any extra moisturizer after which i usually need to use after washing my face
even with oily skin dont get deferred by the cleansing oil
it doesn't dry out my skin.
t doesn't get moldy
you don't have to worry about one of those plastic soap holders
it doesn't have that "oily" residue feeling
it doesn't dry out my skin, either.
is really picky when it comes to washing
the cleansing oil isn't what you'd expect it to be which is non-oily
super dry the next
i dont usually do well with charcoal products
i really liked the cleansing oil not so much the cleansing bar it kind of left my face dry
i would definitely recommend it to someone that doesn't like to use fancy face washes frequently or only does the soap
needs a good scrub once a week
it didn't irritate my skin at all
my only issue is that the gel gets into my eyes somehow
it does try your skin out so before moisturize when you are finished
it did feel like it took the impurities of my skin
the first thing i do is apply cleansing oil on my dry skin
then i just rinse everything off
then the soap gets rid of the rest
my only issue with this is the black soap lather makes a bit of a mess on my counter because i tend to splash stuff all over when i wash my face
is best to do out of the shower
because you have to have dry h
my skin doesn't feel dried out
'm used to leaving a face print on my towels
even as a travel set- it is a little bulky
because it is such a squeaky type of clean
it still doesn’t foam up though!
the oil didn't over soak into my t-zone which is my problem area
the bar dries my skin out so much that it's hard to replenish the moisture
gentle enough but also deep cleaning.
was kind of scared about putting oil on my skin since i have oily skin
so you would need to find one to balance out your cleansing routine
this did not dry my skin out any further
i did feel that it was drying
it did leave my face a bit dry
usually i am content if a facewash doesn't break out or dry out my skin
i also enjoy the oil wash
it can be a little drying
this is also good for home so you don't leave it in the shower for it to melt away from shower water
though it still gave a deep clean without stripping the moisture from my face
even though my skin isn't really sensitive to what i clean it with
around my nose is where it's really oily
this product completely cleans my face to the point where i can really here the squeaky clean noise
know that this has a lightweight-clean scent that doesn't linger
it's very important to start out cleansing the skin without stripping out your essential oils
i love that this set does not dry out my skin at all
was expecting a hot mess on my skin
not even a little bit oily
this cleansing oil does not leave any residue
it has not dried out my skin like most of cleaning bar
while directly after use it feels like it's dried out your skin after i wake up in the morning my skin has never felt better
having dry skin that wasn't the best result.
this formula might be better suited for oily skin
a pump or squeeze dispenser might work better to get just the right amount
the only thing that was tricky was not dumping too much oil into my h
especially because of this winter dry out my skin suffers a lot
not sure if the bars in the other sets smell like this or if it's just the hydra-therapy set
the oil burns my eyes so be very careful when using it
it burns my eyes if i get it in them.
my face was never dry
it got to be really cold outside
usually my face gets really dry
it gave my skin way more moisture than i was expecting
like others have stated i don't feel to good about the soap bar being rubbed on my face
felt like rubbing a bar of soap afterwards was not going to do much
the only thing that still gets be is the bar of soap
i feel like rubbing it directly on your face isn't very sanitary
it was too drying for my face
is hard to wash off
not super dried out
i dont fell my skin more clean
the only issue i had is when i try to remove the oil with the bar soap it irritates my eyes
if your eyes are easily irritated i would stay away
i still can't get over how soft my skin feels after using this
soap made a perfect combo to help avoid leaving your skin dried out
you put the oil on dry skin
rub it in then you get the soap wet
my skin is usually more on the dry side
i don't like the packaging of the oil because you have to be careful that it doesn't spill out
when i use this it certainly dries up all that oil on my face
at first i was leery of using oil to clean my face because part of my skin is oily
during the winter my skin tends to get dry
it tends to dry out very quickly
even though it is an oil based product it did not leave me feeling oily or greasy
not dried out like lots of other cleansers tend to do
i will say that i could definitely see myself using it in rotation or in dryer months for an extra bit of glow
did you used to have oily skin
if you find that your skin is very dry
this might not be hydrating enough for you
they completely cleared my skin in without making me too oily or too clean
it does not leave the skin oily
its so gentle on my skin i did not even had a break out
let me start this review with the fact that my skin is very dry
tends to not break out
although effective was still too drying for my skin
however if you had normal to dry instead of overly dry skin this is definitely something to try
i am prone to dry skin in the winter
can't wait to see the long term effects it has on my winter skin
many of the other products i used in the past did a good job in hydrating my skin yet this is combo left my sking feeling soft
the oil was a litt hard to use since it has an open top that screws off so you have to be careful not to pour too much out
my skin gets drier in the fall
following up with the bar of soap made sure not to have a greasy residue
i struggle with dry skin in the colder months
this set is not drying which you might expect from a cleansing bar
when the season change it becomes really dry
it did a really good job of cleaning my skin
it did a really job cleaning without drying me out
i oil that the oil is thicker than others that i have
not dry at all
didn't leave an oil texture to my skin
i wasn't extremely impressed with the cleansing bar that comes with this as i felt it dried out my skin a bit
the oil locks in moisture to give you back that glow we all love
so to be honest i'm very picky with what i put on my face because i have very drying
new products sometimes dry my face out or even make my t-zone more oily
i like that the soap feels like it lathers really nice
it doesn't dry your face out which is nice
really oily in others
doesn't leave skin dry like most soaps i have tried in the past
soft i had lots of make up on definitely replenished my face
not tight and dry like it normally does!
i get dry flaky spots on my skin which also tend to get overly oily throughout the day
my face gets extremely dry in my t zone.
not oily at all
i found my skin didn't absorb it like normal oils
i assume it is because it's a cleansing oil that breaks up things inside of pores
i felt it had the same waxy skipping finish/feeling as regular bar soap
would put my money on the little packet of refreshing oil though
so smooth it didn't leave an oily or dry feeling to my skin which i love it also gave my skin such a beautiful
i am always a bit skeptical when it comes to trying new cleansers on my face because it usually leaves my skin too oily or too dry
ultimately i loved the fact that my face did not have an oily or dry finish
my face tends to get really dry
weather chance my skin have been acting a little crazy lately especially super dry
it is less messy and drying this way for me.
don't wash the oil off people read the siresctions
this stuff actually made my skin less prone to breaking out
the only little draw back for me is the cleansing oil only because i have lash extensions
the only little draw back for me is the cleansing oil only because i have lash extensions
t doesn't have to touch dirty hotel sinks/showers
it's usually harder to get the cleansing product off
more impressive was the fact that my face didn't feel oily or dried out
i just felt a little dry for the soap
it was also nice because it did not make my already dry skin more dry
dry skin so normally after i wash my face i need to moisturize immediately because my skin will feel so dry
however after using this i didn't feel that immediate urge because it left my skin feeling quite hydrated
you notice it more in the cleansing bar
i've never used an oil like this on my skin before
i recommend trying it if you have dry/sensitive skin
i tried adding more of the cleansing oil-with or without a make up removing pad
this product doesn't dry my skin out however i wish it felt like a deeper clean
the oil gets everything off
because i have dry
the oil before the soap is amazing- my skin has never felt so soft after washing it
and not just soft, but clean.
it doesn't dry out my skin
i would definitely recommend for dry or sensitive skin types
i feel that it gets my skin cleaner than just soap alone
since i got this in my inlufenster box i can't stop using it this cleanser has become a staple in my skin care routine
does not leave my skin tight
i tend to stay away from products that contain oil because i pretty much have combination skin
this product was all my skin needed for the cold weather
my only problem is that the soap does not create a lather
the only down side is that the bar soap can dry my skin out
since everything seems to make my eyes water
the oil is really mild
this product didn't irritate or dry out my skin
yet my skin wasn't oily either
it is dealthly dry naturally
have to be careful not to use soaps that dry me out
minus the serum i felt this dried out my skin just slightly
i also love how clean it makes my face feel not to mention having 2 products that deep clean all the unnecessary stuff on your face is a plus
i always felt i was oily or still dirty afterward
this product does not dry out my skin
is a great medium for when the weather in arizona is transitioning from hot to cool for the winter
doesn't get oily throughout the day
it didn't leave my face oily at all
've just been creating suds in my h
then you wet the bar
it get my colourpop matte lips products off with no problem at all
the oil was good consistency not sticky or thick
the soap did not dry out my skin
there was not a trace of my foundation of the cotton pad
didn't feel too dry
or become more oily
especially if you're traveling or don't typically use bar soaps
i also love the luxe tray they include so you can keep your bar clean
the directions tell you not to get the oil near your eyes
when i was done even before using the serum my face did not feel drying at all
it does not over dry
at first i was nervous about applying oil to my skin because i didn't want to break out
when a product doesn't break my skin out
it dries it out really bad
also doesn't dry my skin out
it does not dry my skin at all
my skin didn't feel dried out after using this set
it doesn't leave my skin overly dry
this has you apply both with your fingers
or like i'm not getting all the residue off my face
the oil is great for sensitive skin since there's no added fragrance or anything
i got the sensitive which i wasn't sure how it would act with my dry skin
it leaves my skin smooth it is early to tell if it is making a difference
i started to notice less black head on my nose even though it's not exfoliating
the bar by itself feels a bit drying
don't feel drying at all
a lot of products cause my skin to break out
some days it's oily some days it is dry
it doesn't dry my skin out
love the power of two that come with cleansing oil
this cleansing duo did not irritate my skin one bit
it doesn't irratates my skin at all
plus the packaging is really pretty in plastic "drawer" that you can use to store your cleansing duo
leaves me skin feeling good not like if i have a ton of products still on it
the application is a bit inconvenient as you have to scoop out the poeder
it doesn't sting or irritate my skin
the mask is easier to scrub off if you take if off in the shower
it does not dry my skin at all.
let it sit for about 30 seconds for a thicker consistency to make application easier
the cream which is not a thick cream btw absorbs you don't even need that much
always been a hunt for a best eye cream to get rid of my dry patches
my under eyes can get very dry
i love how this cream doesn't just sit on the skin as i find most creams tend to do for me
my make up either looks cakes or runs.
you get a lot for the money compared to other eye creams
my eye make up doesn't get greasy through out the day
it doesn't burn my eyes
i wasn't sure about getting this eye cream bc i've been burned before on expensive creams
not greasy or overly cream like
this face wash is the only one i'll ever use because it's the only one that makes me feel hydrated
i've never had a bad reaction to it as i usually do with other face washes
did not dry my skin
i tend to have sensitive skin that breaks out with the wrong products
doesn't have that 'too tight' feeling that most cleansers leave you with
not greasy or sticky at all!
it's definitely not watery but not sticky either.
it's a thicker liquid which i was afraid would leave oily residue
can keep the bottle clean
hydrates well enough that my dry skin in that area feels pretty darn good
it's not thick/heavy at all like other treatments i've tried + my skin feels so smooth
really really sticky though so be prepared.
not the whole face or body
if you suffer from extremely dry skin give this a shot
imagine if you needed something after a peel or just skin reddens
i felt instant relief for my dry skin
i get burnt really easily
i also makes my lips feel like heaven when i use it as an overnight treatment
because the heavy duty creams i normally save for my arms
it feel pretty oily at first
try out different dry areas on my body
worked great on my dry nose from a cold too
even though i use a range of quality moisturizers daily--l'occitane or darphin--my elbows tend to be dry
was not sticky or greasy
any harsh weather or travel
the same damage happens when i get breakouts
hoping this lasts me through the end of our cold spell
if you live in a dry
cold climate like i do
at the moment i have super dry
oils weren't cutting it anymore
doesn't absorb very fast.
you don't have to feel greasy during the day
the texture was concerning because it does feel like petroleum jelly
it's too thick for my taste without mixing it into other skin care
you have to rub it into your skin very well
between dehydration/winter/severe lack of humidity where i live my whole face is pretty dry
s focusing on my dry cuticles making them look alot better
after just one night my skin is noticeably moisturized which never happens
s are that dry it stays greasy longer
i plan to use it for dry spots on my face as well
it has really smoothed it out without irritating it like a lot of other moisturizers
would recommend to anyone suffering from dry skin
it is meant to be thick!
this is the only product that has brought moisture back to my skin
it does have a petroleum jelly like consistency
as in my skin will find any excuse to break out severely
it doesn't break my temperamental skin out
dry you name it
just like you wouldn't use an eye ointment during the day
why most people are complaining about the shimmer in the lotion because if you don't overdo it
i would get dry flakes all the time
it would also get really sore
it will leave your face looking really sticky
something i had never felt having dry skin my entire life
this stuff really plumps up your face too
i would definitely recommend this product for dry skin
don't feel a huge need to use eye cream when i pay this into my undereye
i love this product because not only does it fix dry patches
at night you can put in on your eyelashes
then keep a small jar of coconut oil at my desk at work that i basically slather on all day
or have rough/cracked skin you need to buy this
s due to the dry/cold weather
it's great for crazy chapped lips or dry h
this is a definite cold weather must have
it is a little wet when applied
it doesn't drip off the face or anything.
this wouldn't provide enough moisture for me
be prepared to scrub your h
sometimes it starts looking more oily than glowy on my face
you'll look like a glazed donut if you do
on drier days it doesn't do the job as well
i wouldn't even recommend mixing this with your normal moisturizer for that "glow from within" look
you'll just look like a shimmery hot mess if you do
it does absorb into the skin really well
doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy or oily or anything like that
however if you have dry flaky skin
i can really just use normal highlighter in the place of this
most products marked as having a "luminizing" effect leave me feeling greasy or oily within an hour
would only suggest this if you are putting this on to wear under makeup or if you will only be wearing this indoors mostly or just on cheeks
i mix it with my hope in a jar
i feel like it is too drying to actually be used as a moisturizer
however having extremely dry
i recommend to those who have dry skin.
sometimes oily in my t-zone
it definitely does that without making my skin feel oily
okay so a lot of reviews are saying that this moisturizer has too much glitter
if you aren't into shimmer lotions then of course it would probably seem like excess sparkle
i look like i need to blot my face rather than just wash it
i wouldn't suggest rubbing it all over your face
for me personally i have dry skin
this didn't make me an oil slick within 15 minutes of applying
not greasy or oily looking
i wasn't expecting too much highlight or moisture
it does not have lose gritty glitter
not to wear i will be oily
to see some reviews that say the "glitter" won't wash off or you'll look like a disco ball etc
in store then walk outside so you can see how it looks in sunlight
sun worshiper who rarely used sunscreen of any sort until the last 2-3 years
unfortunately tarts shapetape formula is super dry looking on my skin alone
this stuff does such a great job at brightening that it looks a little silly right after washing my face because my eyes are so bright compared to the rest of my skin
doesn't irritate my skin at all
my undereyes are pretty dry normally
even though it's balmy it sinks into the skin quickly
the kind of creamy eye balm that you reach for on a dry winter night
the product almost seems to melt from a cream to almost an oil after you've applied it to your face
it does tend to dry out the skin around my eye area
it felt smooth but not greasy at all.
it felt smooth but not greasy at all.
i do need to do eye masks still since it absorbs so quickly
let's face it- in order to really attain puff less under eyes you have to drink a lot of water
especially with my undereyes being drier than the sahara in the winter
absorbs quickly enough that i can apply make up over it
i wouldn't recommend putting it on before eye makeup because it can cause it to crease
i don't find that it makes undereye foundation
i always feel like i have dryness underneath my eyes
best to use before bed since it has pretty thick texture
i live in a desert climate where it's cold
not too much for my oily skin
it also doesn't break my skin out
not sticky like the original
because my skin is super dry at all times
my face was always dry
there was no dryness on my dry
i love that because it feels as if it seals in the moisture
this sleeping pack is clearly for people with oily to combination skin
of very dry skin especially in the winter so this doesn't do much for me unless i layer it a few times on top of my moisturizer
does not make my skin feel or appear oily
this does a great job on my dry skin.
was worried once my skin went back to normal i'd be much too oily
slightly greasy if you put on too much
i don't think it would be moisturizing enough on its own for my skin
also making sure i don't look oily
doesn't close pores or make me break out
although i feel a bit more tightness than i do with my typical heavy-duty winter moisturizer
if you're on the drier side you would probably need something extra
not greasy at all.
it is not heavy or oily
i put skin oil over it
if it remains sticky or affects makeup application perhaps you've used too much
i feel like it really brightens the sun damage i am trying to eradicate
my foundation doesn't get all dry and patchy!
if you use the right amount of it your face won't be sticky
warning: anyone with less than dry skin will likely find this to be too much glow
want the most moisture
i love this primer, good for normal to dry skin.
i get very oily throughout the day
will love it even more for my dry skin in the winter
since i have dry skin
my face is never dry
must have for dry skin.
doesn't make me oily at all
i live in the south so the less products i am layering on my face
not too watery either
even where i tend to get more stubborn dry patches like around my nose
no shimmer at all even when it's wet
it doesn't make me oily
in a way i wish it was less dewy because it makes my foundation kind of sticky rather than smooth
i love the way it leaves my skin looking when i wear it by itself
i feel like it comes off white strikes on me i have to rub it in a lot to make it work
it wouldn't be heavy enough for winter for me
this is gentle enough that it doesn't disturb the oily skin or the dry skin
i don't get dry when i apply foundation
i only lightly pat
not dried onto your skin if that makes sense
so weird because this isn't supposed to be a pore filling or minimizing primer
especially if you have oily skin or have trouble getting your makeup to last all day
i will say that i still need to use a different primer on my oily spot
not greasy all day
lightly everywhere else since im more oily in those areas
it is the perfect level of moisture for my skin
even though this hydrates it's exactly what my skin needs
doesn't make me look greasy at all
i wouldn't use it by itself or with a more dewy foundation unless i wanted to look sweaty
its great for dry skin or combination
it seems to stop my t-zone from getting excessively oily like it usually does
i even have worn the primer without other make up while at the beach
i would suggest patting it on your skin rather than rubbing it in
i just pat that spot to blend it in
while those may give a more flawless finish they kind gave a slick feeling
this isn't a traditional primer because i found it much thicker
i actually used this as a primer instead of just a moisturizer because i ran out of my normal primer
recommend to anyone with dry skin or anyone who is on accutane
i take care of my skin
if you are sick of your foundation being uneven or flaky
the only drawback is that my nose tends to get a bit oily
it is keeping my t-zone more matte while not drying out my cheeks as some other products have
doesn't seem to leave a film on your skin
it only takes a couple swipes of this stuff to take off even the peskiest of waterproof eyeliners
it does leave a matte finish but it isn't dry.
my face actually breaks out more if i use soap
so a little will go a long way on your makeup pad or cloth
it doesn't dry out my skin
literally the only thing that takes off my mascara without burning my eyes or irritating them
i normally use this in the morning to refresh because if i wash my face too much it gets irritated
definitely feel the need to rinse after using
feels so great especially after a mask or a shower or even after removing my make up
i absolutely love he smell them i used the tester to remove a few swatches i had done earlier
i can see all the dirt
took the makeup off without me having to rub too much which i have to do sometimes with some cleansers
doesn't leave a greasy residue or make my face shine too much
love that you don't have to rinse it off
good stuff to clean off make up.
don't feel right after or like i need to add moisture which is nice because my skin does not need more oil than it already makes
it's a pretty good moisturizer i have combination skin if you have dry skin i would say you would still have to apply something els after this al
found it annoying using cotton pads to put this on
it would be nice to have a spraying lid instead!
don't leave any residue behind
i am lazy when it comes to face washing
the milk is just thick enough to sit on top of
i could swear it is helping my skin condition
i think these are so perfect for cleansing the face without drying them out
it's thick enough that i can apply it to my face then use my magic eraser cloth to wash my face at night
it has such a cooling smooth feeling when applied to my face
i often find with most removers that it makes my eye area extremely red
dried me out a bit --
i'll take that over truly greasy or having the rest of my face tight
i'll wait with the charcoal for warmer weather to review that one
you can't beat the benefits of charcoal
do not leave a sticky film at all
do leave a semi sticky film after use
it says its a no rinse formula however i definitly think you should rinse
keeping the skin not feeling like it stripped out of all the moisture
some micellar waters leave me oily in the am
best of all it does really work on my skin to cleanse
this does not leave my skin dry
i got rose because i wasn't sure about the others with exfoliants
not hard to wash off
have a hard time finding products for my face that don't make me break out or dry out my skin
first aid beauty-none of that helps my dry skin
i even used it under a powder foundation that normally dries me out
maybe just when i have really dry patches lol
i recommend it to anyone who suffers from dry skin
just make sure you have a tissue or cloth to wipe it off
works like a charm and doesn't dry my face out.
i do not know if it helps with smoothing out lines or wrinkles
the bottle will last forever it's the only thing i've tried that actually minimizes my pores
it doesn't seem to make me more oily
i am not sure about dry skin
it is a good product for dry skin before u make up
it actually gives a "your skin
if you too are a tomato face
this product has arnica on it which totally make it effective i really felt destressed
they dried out my skin soo badly.
i put it on at night after i cleanse if i'm having breakouts or any sensitivities
just let it soak into your skin while you sleep
you'll wake up with a soft
leaves my skin softer than anything else i've ever tried
my dry from this winter season skin loved this!
i even use it as soot treatment just where i need
whent into sephora with the goal of a primer that would help my dry skin as well as moisturize it
best calming mask you could buy
noticed a difference in first time use as well rinse off with warm to cool water as it says :
i didn't even need to apply my foundation powder to hide all the usual redness
after one use i could already tell a difference in the moisture of my skin
usually after the peel my skin is so dry
keeps flakiness down to a minimum while not exaggerating any oily areas at all
it does the job when your'e having a dry face day
quick absorbed yet not heavy cream
it gives me enough moisture throughout the day
i actually have pretty oily skin
even the most "dry skin friendly" makeup starts flaking off after only a couple of hours usually
my face is literally hydrated all day long even after i put my makeup over it
they are all too often sticky
if you don't have *really* dry skin
get the normal to dry version instead.
it also helps to "hold down" the flakes so when i put makeup on over the dry patches
that product wasn't doing the trick for the patches of dry skin that would appear near my nose
my face can be oily
i sweat it off so this cooling gel is the perfect solution for me
it takes 3 pumps to sufficiently cover my face.
often avoid moisturizers because they feel heavy on my skin
this doesn't have as much moisture as i need
this doesnt makeyou oily neither dry i apply it before makeup
granted my skin isn't dry or super oily
no reaction at all except soaking in all the goodness
have been on the hunt for a moisturizer or primer that would help with the dry
especially with the dry weather going on
if you conceal or "bake" heavily you will definitely love this product
after you use this product your face feels sort of sticky
just be sure to let it sink in otherwise it pills slightly
i will probably use something thicker as a night cream since my skin is so dry this winter
doesn't leave my skin too dry or oily.
i get dry especially in the colder months.
or just when i want to feel extra pampered with firm
is that they had a highlighter that looked the way this looks when you dispense it into your h
it made the dry skin go away in just 1 vile
is very hard for me to find a moisturizer that when i put it on at night i won't wake up oily
it doesn't leave me oily or causes breakouts
a little goes a long way- as you work it into the skin it spreads evenly
not greasy or heavy.
a little goes a long way so there's no need to slather this all over
i feel like water bases just dry my skin out
the only down side is that it does make my forehead oily
it is dry here
then you go into ac that makes the air even drier
so to say that my skin is parched would be an understatement
this gives me so much moisture
it doesn't make my milia worse.
i expect to end up with dry patches on my combo skin
it feels like water going onto the skin
honestly a little goes along way i don't have very problematic skin mostly dry patches
does not feel greasy or sticky after applying
now it's not hydrating for 24 hours like they claim
foundation as long as i let it dry completely first
/or you have oily skin
without making me look slick or feel parched
doesn't take forever to dry
oily t-zone with some dry patches
they would either leave me too dry or too greasy
doesn't leave my skin looking oily or wet or sticky
light weight as you put it on
most face moisturizers break me out in some way or another
have a hard finding a morning moisturizer that won't make my face look greasy
try to avoid putting creams on the oily areas of my face
this is plenty sufficient to keep my skin from drying out
after trying to find something that doesn't leave my skin oily
sticky creams -- i had no idea they could be so light
this triple formula did not irritate my skin
it doesn't irritate my oily
i always have dry skin
last winter it was so bad that i couldn't even wear foundation because everything looked so dry
my oily like parts normal
/or make my skin oily
sticky.. but this is different!
won't make your oily skin look oily
i will have to switch to something else during the summer to avoid drying my face out
definitely worth a try if you have naturally oily skin that tends to get dry in weird areas
an actual drink for my combo skin without making my face look slick later in the day
not in a greasy way
it feels almost water-like as you apply it to your skin
i only need to use a small dab for my entire face
it doesn't burn at all.
it didn't irritate my skin at all
this moisturizer is very buildable in the sense you can you use more on extra dry days without feeling heavy
or less on lighter days when you need less moisture
more dry because of the cold weather
this stuff works great to bring that moisture into the skin
can sometimes be oily
this doesn't leave my skin oily
not make the oily areas oilier
this not only doesn't make the oily areas of my skin oilier
i love how light the formula is on the skin.
i think my skin was just so dry that my oil production would increase
this didn't make my face oily
if you're a low key kinda girl who just needs redness
i don't have a problem with it being too dark or causing any lines
i tried this because i wanted a product which added a slight wash of color
because almost all products emphasize my dry patches no matter which primer or moisturizer i use underneath
i've only been able to use bare minerals powder foundation since it goes on so light
sometimes a little dry due to retin-a use
i would probably not recommend this unless you use it for contouring or you have a dark tan
i find that putting it on the skin
" not thick or sticky under make up
it feels greasy even with powder to set the foundation
it doesn't feel dry actually the opposite.
it was slightly oily in my t zone
if this product came in a lighter shade i would absolutely buy it
just blend and you will be hooked.
i am more on the oily side
it did not make my face feel greasy at all
it does take a while to absorb completely into the skin hence "overnight detox"
it is a little sticky at first
my skin definitely feels more plump when i wake up as well as throughout the day
have normal to dry skin
didnt want a treatment that would dry me out
so i get a very oily face throughout the day.
when i start to see oil i just blot this in the oily spots
most oil controlling products i've used have made my skin go dry
no more oily residue for me!
when i do apply over my makeup it makes my foundation look sort of "muddy"
it does keep it quite matte though!
i don't always like blotting with powder because i don't like being totally matte or powdery looking
my t-zone area would already be oily
i blot a little on my t-zone area after my makeup is done
my entire face is super oily.
i didn't really see any makeup removed onto the applicator afterwards although this would probably happen more if touching up already oily skin later in the day
i feel like it's not super sanitary to keep having to blot the oil
not dry after using it
my face is usually a big oily mess less than an hour after i put on my makeup
it's not even bad enough for me to grab a blotting sheet or apply more of this
it's just now starting to feel a little dried out
not one mattifyjng primer or setting powder stops it from getting oily
i don't have to blot once.
haven't had any issues with the packaging or it drying out
my makeup is not disturbed when applying over my liquid foundation
it's definitely a must if you have somewhat oily skin or want to tone down a foundation that has too much shine
really does keep you mostly matte all day!
the directions do say to dab as little product as possible
this product not only got rid of my shine
i get very oily throughout the day
i put it on after primer in my oily areas
i recommend this to any one who gets oily during the day
it looks as though you have fresh baby skin all day
i can go a full 17 hours looking matte
just like many other oily girls i've tried it all
my oily t zone is so bad
you can see the layer of oil
i would rather have it as a liquid in a bottle with a screw top
it completely mattified my very oily face
i try not to wear makeup everyday to avoid my skin getting too clogged so this is what i've been dreaming of
the only reason i gave it 4 stars is because since it is a thin liquid
it works really well at blotting away all of my oil
very cool to the touch when applied to the face
my skin looks like i could fry something on it
it is not drying
and my skin will dry out.
there's nothing worse then touching my face
you will find this is the hg product for oily skin
maybe it is the moisture in the air i dont know
i also don't feel like my skin is losing moisture
one of the best things i have ever tried for my oily skin
i highly recommend to the oily friends out there!
i tend to get shiny t-zone.
with it being winter my skin has been so dry
i can't use just about every product i try without breaking out into terrible acne around my mouth
its only drawback is that it does dry the skin.
though it does get a healthy lather
always found perricone face wash formulas to be lacking
you just warm it up between your fingers
apply it wherever you need that extra bit of moisture
yet is absorbed miraculously fast so you don't feel greasy
it's a great skin-saver for those drier months!
i wanted a product that would give me moisture
i like it since i'm so used to having noticeably dry skin
i wouldn't recommend for someone who has very oily skin
needs some powder because it goes on shiny
you can't really wear it on its own because it looks really shiny on the skin
didn't leave a sticky or heavy feel
this does protect my skin so well
it does feel like regular cheap cream with spf
s down this product gives your skin so much moisture
i hate the heavy, oily feel.
i won't have to worry about that nasty sunscreen feel on
don't want to spend 7 minutes on blending the cream formula into my eyes
thus comes in wastes a lot because you press it shut
see when you mix water you can decide whether to make it a scrub-like cleanser or a soapy
the powder can get a bit messy
the don't think the charcoal mask helped at all
i used this product every two days it doesn't dry my skin
i got this in a tester to see how it would react with my dry
every 2nd or 3rd day since it is an exfoliant so you don't want to strip you oil in your face
i love the value of it since you only need a bit of powder to get a good amount of suds
i wash my face in the shower because it's easier
it's not too drying for my dry nose
if i want to use it as an exfoliator i just add a tiny bit of water
if you use an oil or a heavy moisterizer then it's fine for dryer combo skin types like mine
i like the way it foams up too.
i don't have to worry about it going bad as i rotate through several different scrubs
i personally don't like the peel off black charcoal masks as they pull at the skin
which is great because that means there aren't many harmful fragrant chemicals that do more harm than good
the plus with it being a powder is that it lasts so long
was pretty excited to see they made this cool powder cleanser too
the powder can make your sink a little messy
i can control how much exfoliation i want by the amount of water i'm adding to the product
i can feel it firming my face
however it is so thick
it doesn't leave my skin greasy or sticky.
by my experience this mask is the perfect thing to chase away dry winter skin
it doesn't like oily products
i highly recommend this to those with dry skin or if you need some plumping
finding products that do not dry out my skin further or irritate my sensitive skin has been difficult
you really do need to massage it in for a while in order for it to change into the dark chocolate color
it does burn a little bit
difference can be seen straight after you rinse your face
it will change your skin
t's hard to find a mask that doesn't burn or make my skin red afterwards
do not get this in your mouth when you're washing it off
if i accidentally scratch my skin i get huge
the following day i use a moisterizing mask since this product can dry your skin
or as often as you can tolerate depending on your skin
then i need to skip my retinol for 2 days afterwards
best tip is not to apply this if your skin is in an irritated state
in front of the refrigerator while it's working it's magic on your skin
felt like my skin's ph levels were not balanced because one day i would be oily the next dry
there is a burn when this goes on
or don't get enough sleep or drink enough water
it does sting or burn a little when i first apply it
i awake to skin that looks better than if i had an extraction facial
the actual burn the peel produces is really not bad at all
i suggest not rubbing it in so much when applying it
no matter how much i exfoliate it doesn't help
this gets rid of them
you can pry it out of my cold dead h
or burn me like others experienced
apply a thinner layer than you think you need
in definitely stings for the first few minutes--especially if you have any open acne
it does sting/burn a little bit when first applied
i noticed that the mask did make my skin burn just a bit
you will get some tingling with this
when i first put it on it burns soo stinkin bad that i want to wash it off immediately
after washing it off my skin is so soft
it does sting a bit on application
glow about my skin that isn't there otherwise
when you wash it off
even better as you'll wake up with glowy baby soft skin that is even more beautiful after a good nights sleep soaking in a ton of marula oil
following with drunk elephant's luxury marula oil your skin will feel renewed
the mask did burn a bit
it does not dry out my skin
this did tingle when applied
i highly recommend this for people with dry or sensitive skin that want a good cleanse with the skin feeling stripped
it is the only moisturizer that can really hydrate my skin regardless if it's summer or winter
when i do hot the moisturize does control the sweat
i've even used it for my 16 n 7 yr old when they had sunburn on their face
this is the best moisturizer i have ever used because it doesn't leave my face feeling sticky or oily
it's not sticky if you mix gel
i am currently using a topical cream for acne which is drying out my skin really bad combined with being in the sun all the time
doesn't make you oily
i recommend this product to people with dry skin
that will not break me out because i am acne prone
feels just rich enough without being heavy.
i say this noticing some other reviewers didn't feel like this hydrated enough
t helps with the dry areas without being super greasy on my oily areas
i find light cream too heavy for my skin
i feel like i'm giving my dry skin exactly what it needs when i put on this moisturizer
even took care of some dry patches
as i found i wasn't getting an even consistency of cream/gel when i'd scoop
my t-zone has been so dry
not too gel like
it comes with a little spoon which i love for sanitary purposes
this is the only face cream i have used that keeps my dryness at bay
it is no longer dry
have dry skin that is often dull
i can start wearing foundation without it looking cakey or go oh natural
it's not possible to go to bed without lathering my face in this stuff now
i always get a zit at the first use of anything on my face
which i normally would with regular argan oil
does tend to get a bit dry this time of year
i'd bathe in this stuff if i could
highly recommend for those with dry skin like me.
you use only 2 or 3 drops for your face
more like a dry oil.
not at all greasy
on my aged combination skin it seems to sink in better
i don't want to use a cosmetic sponge because it will absorb too much of the oil
i sometimes use it on its own if my skin is really thirsty
as a drop of fuel for any face oil or face cream
only really just liked the pure argan oil until this reserve
not greasy at all.
the regular oil although it did make my face feel softer than the regular oil
it smells very natural like they pressed the whole tree into an oil
i typically use the regular argan oil by josie marian when i straighten my hair
i also added a little on my winter chapped h
it does not make me more oily
i could see how some may not like as thick or luxurious of a texture
plus it doesn't leave that sticky filmy feeling on my h
once soaked in it really is light
occasionally if i am wearing a hydrating foundation as well it can look a little too dewy/oily on my slightly oily skin
would never put it under makeup bc it does appear a bit oily before it soaks in
you have to let the cream sink into your skin
i live in a very dry climate
because the cream is so rich
i literally cannot believe how quickly it started to not only moisturizer my skin
i would say that this moisturizer is probably best suited for more oily skin types that don't need as much hydration
this product doesn't leave my skin oily
it didn't make it oily throughout the day
ample enough for night time use when you need an extra boost of moisture
as i write this our humidity is sitting at a whopping 2%
dry skin so finding a moisturizer that gives my skin enough moisture without over doing it
i would recommend onlyusing if you have dry/ combination skin regardless that the bottle says it is for all skin types because i could see it being too much for someone with oily skin
when i first used it i thought it would be greasy because it starts off heavy
i can literally go bare face with my dehydrated skin
rinse off in the morning your skin will look even
it helps quench my skin so that it does not produce extra oil to compensate
i does not seem heavy or leave a waxy residue on my skin
because touching sticky things/getting sticky stuff on my clothes/eating sticky stuff is literally one of my biggest pet peeves
being fully covered in honey is what pure torture would be for me
making sure to rub it in until it's totally absorbed because it is really thick
it doesn't seem to absorb quick enough for makeup application
what i didn't like about tidal is that my skin still felt dry
was using more than i should have just to get that moisturized feeling
i typically have really oily skin
not greasy in the least
it's perfect for dry skin in the winter as it is so thick
it is not oily at all!
i usually pat some juno oil on top of it
it is not only hydrate that moments when i just applied
no sign of dryness, and no oil or greasy at all.
oily skin may not love it that much.
look for extra moisture in the winter
unless you use it very sparingly
i feel like it would be too greasy.
for someone with really dry skin
then sets to this kind of velvet finish without being greasy at all
does not leave residue
get compliments on my skin all the time
right now my skin is on the drier side
i like that it's heavier than tidal to give a little extra hydration
i always always always end up with stubborn blemishes that lingered forever anytime i used anything with vitamin c
and not as oily as usua in the t zonel.
not greasy at all
first of i have fair super oily
most dry me out
infact i think it helped keep my skin from drying out
if some spots on my face still felt dry i would add a little more
it was leaving my skin dry
this doesn't leave me greasy
i typically get headaches from heavily scented products so this was just right for me
they just dried the heck out of my skin
even get dry in some areas
this may be too heavy for others in warmer climates
it doesn't break out the oily
you don't need slather it on your face
it does solidify in colder weather
even though i have very oily skin
not irritating in the least
i cannot even put into words how blown away i am by this moisturizer-
it does take a while for the oil to soak into my skin
gives it that feeling of moisture whenever i use it
finally something that doesn't irritate my skin or dry me out
i also love to use this after i work out as a natural way to cleanse my face without over-washing my skin
not greasy, not dry.
so amazing for dry problem skin!
just be careful because it's runny
tends to run though your fingers easily before it gets on your face
also doesn't clog my sink drain which i never knew could be an issue until i tried the lancôme cleansing oil
im glad that i can wash my face without worrying about harmful ingredients that will irritate
/or dry out my skin
doesn't dry up the rest of my skin
this is the only cleanser i keep going back too.
t usually take a while to clear out my pores
doesn't make my skin feel dry
it's gentle enough that it doesn't dry me out or cause any redness
something that most gentle face washes are incapable of doing
it didn't clean my skin
it works well with my dry
doesn't dry my skin out
although my face seems to be a little drier than normal
not the least bit drying or irritating, either.
even though it's a gentle cleaner it got off all of those heavier serum's
frankly was afraid of using his regular acne wash so he tried this
i usually don't invest a lot of money on cleansers because since they are rinsed off
best face wash so far i used
don't have to use much for foam.
didn't dry out my face.
feel like i need more heavy duty products to really clean my skin
only downside was that i felt like i had to rinse my face excessively to ensure the product wasn't leaving a residue
i usually double cleanse anyway
she said that it was probably my face wash that was drying me out so much
it also doesn't make me oily in the areas where i usually get oily
love how foamy it gets too
just don't get it in your nose
i found this also works very well for removing deodorant from your armpits which can sometimes be/feel water-proof
when i used this it truly cleaned my face
it sort of left my skin oily afterwards.
i don't feel dry
i wasn't expecting much since most cleansers seem to dry my skin out
since you barely need any to get a huge lather
it does leave me a little dry after i wash it off
when i get wet
sticks to your face once you apply water
it doesn't dry out my poor dehydrated face
doesn't strip my skin too much
i still need to follow up with a decent oil or moisturizer afterwards
something that wouldn't dry me out or sting
i tend to get dry
this stuff doesn't irritate my skin or dry me out
i may never use another brand of face wash again!
i wouldn't recommend if you have dry skin as personally i feel it has a bit of the opposite effect as opposed to hydrating
does not dry my skin
it gets rid of all of my make up
couldn't seem to find the perfect face wash that doesn't dry out my skin until now
have been searching for a cleanser that doesn't give my skin that tight feeling
would recommend to anyone who has very dry skin.
did not cleanse my face at all
i love that this is not as drying as regular acne treatment products because those can make your skin overcompensate
if you are not used to a deep cleanser or have dry skin
this will dry your skin if you don't use proper products afterwards
at first i was afraid it would be drying
my skin isn't prone to drying after this product
i don't think it made my face dry
i do recommend this product to people who have oily/dry combo
this cream is too oily for me
even if i only applied a tiny bit of it
it will definitely be a good product for dry skins
can i just tell you the mixture is life changing.
it never feels heavy or oily
if i could afford it i would soak my skin in a vat of this stuff
my face doesn't get oily like it used to.
if you are someone with dry patches or dry skin in general
i mean severely: in the summer in a humid climate i still have trouble
i would say that if you don't have a severe dryness problem
i imagined that the heavy cream would make my face oily
rub the heck out of it between your fingers to warm it
even if this does have ingredients that read like old school granny cold cream
give it a try if you have red/sensitive skin.
if always had dry skin
you do need to rub together to warm up the product as it is thick
if you warm in your fingers for a bit
i did not notice much different just slightly or hydrated
my skin can get very dry
i started to see my skin just getting dull
like so dry that if i don't put anything on after i wash
after i figured out how to warm up the creme
my skin stays soft until i wash it
you should press a bit between your fingers to warm it up a little
i don't use for my face so much i mostly use on my neck
one star off because i am worried the kind of tub it is in might not be good to keep bacteria out
i only use this on my nose because i have a very dry nose
i lightly scrape the tip of my nail to get a very small amt
i think the oily reviews are using too much.
because you use so little the jar lasts a very long time
i love this cream because not only does it help keep my skin soft
it's too thick for me in the warmer months
it's great for my skin type when the weather is mostly drying up my skin
you just won't get these great results from other creams
there is nothing like it in terms of making your skin so baby soft
it really makes your skin softer not just after you apply
especially if you put a small amount on your fingers
it actually lasts long cuz you only take very small amount of it melted in your palm then press it slightly on your skin
it is good for my combination skin in the dryer months
t is tough to find a product that is moisturizing without breaking me out
every other night so my skin is especially dry
i could see maybe getting a small jar in the winter
t floors me that they describe this as "light weight" moisture
feels so good slathering it on my face.
it saved me from really dry patchy skin once.
another time it was the only moisturizer that didn't clog the pores when i was breaking out quite badly
rub it until you have warmed up the product
then pat it onto all throughout your skin.
not oily at all
i can't live without this eye cream.
some eye creams are over powering or make your eyes water when getting close to the water line
this never makes my eyes water
it makes spreading the cream on after so much easier
you need to tap it with your finger to warm it up
you apply it with is always cold
you really only need the size of 2 peas to lather your entire face
this is going to dry out my skin quickly"
you can use it a little bit like a soy bean size
lately my skin just feels so dry in the florida sun
although i have pretty dry skin
i find that it doesn't cause any milia either which i often struggle with if an eye cream is too heavy
and you only need 2 drops for your face
wasn't too heavy or left me feeling oily in my t-zone
that would get rid of the dry patches around my nose
it can get a little flaky if you don't pat it in until it absorbs
it didn't break out my sensitive skin
i will say that it was not super moisturizing for the more dry spots i had on my face
or you're just trying to recover your skin from a day of exposing under the sun
i love how it just soaks in to my skin without feeling oily
keeps me from getting oily even in the most humid
the only thing i do notice is that my skin seems to be alittle oilier the next morning after use
it seems weird to add a liquid like this over top of your makeup
this is a great find for oily skin.
it has a light powdery feel which is great for those like me who hate that heavy
the pores themselves didn't seem to get smaller
as a result my skin is dry
unfortunately it made it so this product did nothing to my bare skin as my face is already matte
using a lot of this product it didn't dry out my skin
didn't feel like you were adding another layer of products on your face
it also has a super lightweight texture so you feel like you are wearing nothing at all
when i used it i noticed it took my skin a lot longer to look oily
since i have such dry skin
if you are oily
if you don't prefer a slippy silicone feel then definitely get a sample first
t doesn't feel slippy especially that i have oily skin
t doesn't feel like you're caking up your face
it does a great job at removing excess oil from your skin
it won't get too oily
under your make up
you can even dab a little on top.
this could be because i have very oily skin
it's like walking around with your favorite instagram filter
this product is gonna be my go to everyday in the summer for that matte fresh look
i wouldn't recommend to dry skin.
his may be way too drying
even make your skin look like it's cracking
can be used on bare skin
although i do not have oily skin
my t zone can get quite oily
not a heavy or oily product which is nice.
make sure you pat it into the skin because rubbing it in will not give you the proper effect
just pat on top of your foundation if you're shiny instead of using blotting papers
however i did get a few dry patches on my face
because it made my face look cakey when i used it with full coverage foundation
not oily at all
which i find too drying for my dry skin
like you're making it worse or moving around all your makeup
i always hated those heavy silicone based primers that claim they matify yet turn my makeup into an oil slick after a few hours
my oils always break through
i stay significantly more matte than if i wore my nars primer alone
you can also use this serum ontop of your makeup for touch ups
i usually wear makeup daily because as i age i have begun to feel self conscious about my pores
wearing makeup can cause me to break out which makes me layer it on even more the following days
it does get a little bit try so be sure to put moisturizer on first
i think it would perform even better on someone with oily or combination skin because of it's mattifying effect
also makes your t-zone look flat
blended into my face so much better
also keep me oil free!
often stick to the same skin care products to prevent my skin from breaking out
dab a little bit in areas where you find yourself typically oiling out throughout the day
it really does smooth out you skin
make it look like you are using a filter in your normal life i love it
coming from a person with oily skin
it only takes a tiniest bit on your t-zone too
so you can check it out if you have dry skin
is super light weight not drying at all
i could still see some pores
though it did not completely hide my pores
the way to use this is either during the last steps of skin care or over your base makeup the magic of this stuff is that it fills skin surfaces with moisture by keeping them super hydrated
by this time i was quite oily
would use it only during the warmer months when i tend to get sweaty as this product is mattifying
i did find it left a slight tackiness on my skin which i think helped my makeup last longer
this product is best for normal-oily skin individuals though i find it works well for me when my skin isn't so dry
i just pat some on over my makeup or if i get oily during the day
mattifies my face without making my face cakey like when i apply powder
i highly recommend if you have oily/combo skin
is actually a serum so a tiny pea size will cover your entire face because it melts in as you deliver it to your thirsty face
becomes creamy as you put it on
you'll wake up with new skin
my face gets very oily in hotter
i like how my fine lines just absorbs the product
since i do not have very dry skin i do not pair this with a strong moisturizer
was unable to find perfect for my skin conditions
the consistency is so smooth but not too oily.
i do find that it is sometimes soothing when my skin is red/hot or agitated
i also how you can rub it on dry skin!
you have to use wet h
i never thought i would like a cleansing oil
it doesn't feel greasy & it washes off easily.
my eyes do not burn
you just massage the oil over your dry face to melt all your makeup away
my skin dries out easily during the winter so using this cleansing oil instead of my regular face was during colder months has saved my skin
i expected it to feel oily but it wasn't at all!
it's also nice because it doesn't leave your skin feeling all dry
i love how it goes from oil to milk!
good for dry skin in summer!
generally something light and non-greasy.
we don't care about our skin looking dewy
i would recommend this to anyone with oily skin.
made me more oily
this is one of the few moisturizers that i have tried that doesn't break out my face
getting very little sleep
to the point where my concealer no longer has to work overtime to hide them
it is not greasy!!!
i get plenty of sleep
it's to the point where i would consider going in public without my under eye concealer
i don’t have to worry about getting too close to my lash line
it feels so weightless when you apply it
i tried some others before getting into non-toxic beauty
most moisturizers make me oily or cause break outs
because i am oily
it sinks into the skin without being overly greasy
it keeps my skin from getting too dry
many products for dry skin are too heavy
it was the perfect amount of extra moisture for nighttime
i think using this oil in conjunction with a cream helps the oil absorb better into the skin
the texture on certain areas of my face is completely gone
tend to stay away from oils
if you read up on squalane oil you'll feel so much better about putting that on your face compared to what's in some other oils
when you use natural stuff
can't believe i've been avoiding oils till now.
so you would think that an oil based moisturizer would make it worse
nothing artificial or unpleasant
found it to be too oily
it also felt a little bit greasy on my face for quite awhile before fully absorbing into my skin
it's will hydrate your skin like nothing else.
i love to use this oil on my hair
this is the only one that hasn't caused me to get patches of dry skin on my chin
i did make the mistake of using too much on my wet hair
i live in a dry cold climate
i forget i'm even wearing an oil!
i decided to try it out on my shins that are also chronically dry
especially if you have dry or sensitive skin
have always had dry skin
i love that i can put it in my hair as well as on my skin
i live in a very cold climate
is enough to cover my face
i feel like it has definitely helped keep my face from flaking or appearing dry
it feels like all of the serums i use prior get sealed in
i even use it on my lips when the weather changes
you can cover your entire face with one dropper full
not only did it help the dry patches
couldn't find a cream that worked.
i literally feel like i have put cake batter on my skin
looking into the other skin laundry products now for him :-
it works super well to help blemishes overnight if you apply it as a spot treatment
i am sure that it may sting if you are new to acids
it's moisturizing enough to get away with using it alone
this doesn't seem to cause much of a purge period
i usually hate putting sunscreen on because it always feels so heavy
not be too thick since i live in a very hot
i love all of the skin laundry products that i have tried so far
you only need a small amount to wash your whole face
it does dry your skin so better use a good toner
in winter i still feel dry
this is extremely light weight doesn't break me out at all
it's definitely a plus when i mix it with my drunk elephant hydra b in the am when i need an extra kick of moisture
i live in south florida so things can tend to feel heavy very easily
sometimes i have to skip a night otherwise i get too dry
i am very dry because of using that along with another acne face wash product
have been very happy with how well it hydrates the skin around my eyes
this cream sinks in fast enough to use in the morning
those with very dry skin might need something heavier at night
it gave the skin around my eyes the perfect moisture it needed
the lotion barely has any scent which is what i would prefer for something going near my eyes
it doesn't burn but it is a little greasy.
it's a bit oily for me as a day time eye cream since i have combination skin
it does absorb well
you feel how cooling it is
very refreshing when it is applied to your face
it is very hard for me to find an eye cream that does not make my skin dry out or even cause it to be too sticky feeling
can be applied with your finger
the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars was because it made my skin sticky after application
it comes with a little spatula so you aren't digging your fingers in the product every time
it also doesn't flake or make my make up flake.
there is no stinging or burning once applied.
the light smell is enough that if you have sensitive skin it should cause any breakouts
this eye cream is perfect for make-up no make-up.
you might need to warm it up between your fingers before massaging it onto your eye area for quicker absorption
aside from actually working it also has a light clean scent
don't wash my face enough
my eye make up does not get those greasy creases you get with other eye creams
sometimes with other eye creams if they do not absorb well you sometimes find it will run into your eyes
i like gstbit doesn't over dry my skin
although you only use a dab or so everyday
that it doesn't burn my eyes like some eye creams do
if you need a tightening feeling before your makeup
the only thing is that i have to pat it in after any serums
after the first use my skin wasn't overly oily for the whole day
doesn't dry out my skin
however i feel when i wash my face with this
i always do wake up with oil the next day without me even moisturizing
all of the cleansers i tried were too harsh or didn't really help
when i wash my face i actually feel it working.
it's not abrasive and doesn't leave any residue.
my face no longer looks like an oil slick!
only having them dry my skin out completely
i got this because i'm oily
it literally only takes one pea size drop of cleanser to get a really good wash
might not be good for those with dry/normal skin as it is an oil control product
i do not have oily skin
it's only reduced oiliness right after i use it
my skin is no longer oily.
this doesn't dry my face out
balanced without stripping it of too much moisture or irritating it
i still get a bit oily
my skin definitely is more oily than anything
sometimes when i wake up my face can be extremely oily
it helps balance out my skin all day
i find i'm so much less oily
would recommend if you have very oily skin!
it doesn't dry out my face like the murad cleanser did
i do notice that my skin is a little less oily
not in that odd squeaky-clean way
my face is less oily
i would say this is more of a daytime cleanser as it makes you feel more alert
it foams up really well with little product
it doesn't dry my skin out a bit
i would advise you to be cautious of over-washing as it will dry out your skin
so you only need a small drop to get a great lather
it didn't strip my skin
leave it too tight or dry
i don't usually use products that are for oily skin as i have dry sensitive skin
it's even encouraged me to wash my face more
i actually have oily skin
doesn't leave my skin too dry
doesn't leave my skin dry or stripped
it doesn't dry it out
not dry or tight
i generally have skin on the drier side
didn't make my skin fee too dry after using it
does not leave my skin parched
i can only use it once a day otherwise my skin get irritated
so you have to lather it before applying it all over
great oil control, and does not dry out my skin.
it does not strip the skin
let me just start by saying that i have combination skin that leans more on the side of oily
this doesn't strip my skin of oils or leave my feeling dry
keeping my face grease free all day long
a little harsh in the winter months while my skin is a little drier
however i can't wait to use this in the summer when i'm super oily
controls my oily skin for at least 36 hours!
the rest of my face can be very dry
doesn't seem to dry out the skin at all
i feel like i'm getting a deep clean with this product as it foams up very nicely :
i am pretty skeptical about oil control skincare products because most tend to be too drying
my skin is typically dry as it is
this is a rare find when dealing with most oily skin
i love that it doesn't dry my skin out.
it's great at keeping the oily side of my skin at bay while not drying out the rest of my face
although i have oily/combination skin
i like that this isn't over drying
not oily or dirty
it doesn't leave any residue after using
it definitely is more for people with oily skin.
however i would recommend it for girls or guys who suffer from really oily skin
or that dry-tight feel
always oily by mid day with some dry patches
it washes off like a dream without making my skin feel to dry or tight
excess oil from my skin without being too drying
this does not make my skin feel dry nor oils
the face wash isn't drying which ends up happening with oil control cleansers
it can sometimes sting if i get it near my eye area
this cleanser is great because as i've been getting older i've been noticing it more oily skin throughout the day even though i am primarily dry skin
i usually use it on my lighter days when i didn't wear too much make up
my skin isn't overly dry from the cleaner to the toner- which is great
a little drop of cleanser will go a very long way
didn't feel drying at all!
it really helped to control the oil on my face which then helps with my acne
didn't dry it out too much
used to only use on the oily parts of my face
it's really good at keeping away grease
not at all greasy.
probably not so much for the winter as i would imagine skin would feel too dry
only having them dry my skin out completely
not as a daily moisturizer with nothing on your face since it's very effective as what it advertises
in my case it was so effective sucking up the oil off my skin
i can only apply this to my overly oily areas
otherwise i will get flaky skin
i did notice the foundation applied smoothly which is a big deal because occasionally it's patchy because it dries so quickly
i don't have dry skin
it doesn't make your face as smooth if you slather too much on
this doesn't dry my face out
this may help some of you who feel that the ole balancing products are too drying
while it doesn't completely prevent oil
keeps me from getting as oily as i normally do
i don't have to blot nearly as often
my t zone was less oily
since moving to a humid climate near an ocean my skin did a complete 360 from normal-acne free
extra bonus as i don't like putting tons of layers on my face
as i don't like how sticky it feels on my skin
a lot of primers don't work for me on their own or they leave a white cast on melanin rich skin
i get very oily in my t-zone
works really well to prevent my face from getting oily
there's also a nice cooling effect when u first put it on
would make this my main moisturiser except it doesn't contain spf
it didn't make my skin more oily than it naturally is
my face is usually an oil-well.
it didn't dry me out at all
if you are sensitive to the peppermint effervesce you might want to start out with a sample
i normally expect a product made for oily skin to make me matte
great for the oily/normal areas of my face
not enough for the dry areas
my skin tends to get a bit more oily during this time
for someone who is very oily
it didn't matter if i used setting spray or setting powder
it's not something that makes your skin feel completely oily again like a lot of hydrating products do
going to go workout this would work well for you because it is not oily or greasy
it's not bad especially for people who have oily skin
i wouldn't recommend this if you have super dry skin or use a really drying/harsh face wash
i live in a very humid climate
need lotion for the more humid months not that i'm overly oily or anything
with the hot humid months any lotion that isn't light or for oily skin is horrible on my skin
i actually have oily skin
i actually love the oil control product has well me a lot with my oily face
it's not oily afterwards either
my skin can get pretty oily
you have oily skin
need more control of that oily skin
or if you just have normal to oily skin like me
so your skin doesn't try to hydrate itself with unnecessary oil
you're not going to get tons of moisture
enough to help settle out your skin
for someone with very oily skin this gives a good amount of hydration without being too thick
let me just start by saying that i have combination skin that leans more on the side of oily
make it even oilier
some products will be too drying
others will make me even more oily
the toner was basic to me but did the job.
overall i would give this collection a try if you generally have normal to oily skin that gets congested
the rest of my face can be very dry
because it isn't drying
the struggle is real trying to find a moisturizer that provides my skin with a substantial amount of hydration without also making me break out
doesn't dry out the skin or make it oily as most moisturizers do
this doesn't make it look more oily
i usually look like my face was hit an oil slick by 10am even with using mineral powder foundation
it's great for oily skin even in the winter.
usually my skin gets dry in the winter
it does give me a feeling that there is a layer of protection on my face
my face has been less oily
your skin will love it
it doesn't have any lingering residue
i think it does a great job of cleansing your skin of oils without stripping it dry
the moisturizer i feel is always the most tricky part as some are either too drying or too greasy
i do however prefer a heavier cream at night
this is perfect in the mornings to avoid getting too shiny or oily
is that it did make my skin sting
it doesn't do much for evening out skin tone
you can feel your skin tightening as well as incredibly smooth the next morning
doesn't bother my sensitive skin at all
it doesn't dry my skin at all!
otherwise this is a good eye cream
it definitely stings if you get it into your eyes so just gently pat under your eyes
for those of you that aren't milia prone
let it soak in
i usually don't apply make up right away after my skincare
i don't think eye cream is supposed to burn.
all i need to do is just tap my finger on the cream
noticed it happens when i accidentally put it too close to my water line or if i have too much on my fingers
doesn't feel oily like some
it was a rather thick cream which could feel too heavy at times
fast absorbing which is good because it doesn't feel heavy under the eyes
emollient so you only need a little to spread over the area
this is the product for you if you have dry-combination skin
once i applied it on my skin
yet not greasy at all
make up that does not cause pilling
just what my sensitive skin needs for spring-summer
although i'll definitely be trying this in the cooler weather
i got this for summer wear because i have oily skin
my skin absorbs it better when i start off with a small amount
this doesn't run in the heat
humidity like some foundations do
especially if you use a good setting spray with it
there is no need to worry if it is too yellow or too pink
it is not ashy or grey at all.
it is not heavy
just make sure to let it dry before applying the next layer
love putting this on after a shower because it gives some life to my skin
using a concealer with it when u want to go pretty light on your face it works pretty well
i do like to powder this since i'm oily
didn't think i would like this skin tint so much since most base products don't match me or last on my oily skin
hope in a jar on its own without the tint is great skin care so not only us it pretty
you can also set it with powder if you want a matte look
you should probably go with the lightest shade
it just doesn't settle or get patchy like foundations
find its a bit too heavy for the warmer months in humid nyc
doesn't create excess oil or feel "heavy"
it has the perfect amount of moisture for my skin also
cream are too greasy for me
i mainly use this moisturizer in the warmer months when my skin is not asking for added moisture
with regular use, my skin is less oily.
while also being greasy
to help cool against the humidity
dry depending on how well i take care of it
it seemed like it dries too quickly on my face as i apply it
this does wonder for dry skin any time of the year
when i first used the concentrate i always make sure i have some in my dark cool cosmetics storage area for skin emergencies
i enjoy this stuff because you don't need to rinse after using
i found it left too much of a residue on my skin
i seriously use less then a half a pea size on my face scrubby that i run under warm water first
my only complaint is it's a little thin so when i apply it ends up going on my finger tips
doesn't feel heavy or sticky
overly oily at the same time
it also dries my skin more with every day use
doesn't irritate my sensitive skin or cause it to break out like caudalie's radiance serum did
it can feel a bit dry at times
if you are in your early 30's with oily or combination skin this is great
does not feel greasy.
does not feel greasy.
it is a pretty lightweight oil that i use over my face
as someone with really oily skin i do find that if i use too much i can get a small clogged pore
t don't dry all the way
it doesn't make you fill like its dripping off your face or a heavy filling
it does not play well with a wet beauty blender
lips which tend to get very dry
i don't have any kind of oily skin
it needs some moisture get this
for those saying that it is oily
1-2 drops mixed in your foundation is more than enough otherwise it thins out your makeup too much
doesn't disturb my primer or foundation at all
i don't see it making my skin feel any more oily than usual
this oil doesn't sit on my skin
therefore, your face does get oily.
my face is generally on the drier side
it tends to be a bit oily
i typically do not apply oils on my face until now
oils tend to break me out
i don't know it the gold flakes are an added bonus skin care wise
full coverage with it not feeling heavy on my skin as if i was doing a full glam
i wouldn't use this in the morning as i find it stays oily on my skin
i will say that the oil did make my pores more visible
especially since this elixir doesn't take forever to dry like a regular oil
i can go 12 hours without worrying about my oily face
not leave me oily
how could i resist buying it when it has gold flakes that melt on your skin?
normal to dry the rest of my face
i mean that i now mix a few drops of this stuff into my anti-wrinkle cream
definitely let it soak in to the skin for like 10 minutes if you don't want to look oily or cakey though
that's that i have oily skin with patchy dry areas
it can make your skin very oily though!
he has very dry skin so he love it
the next morning my face felt very oily yet dry
i heard that dry face oils may still work for me
i let it soak in my skin overnight
you don't need proof of purchase before reviewing on here so take everything with a grain of salt
i usually have oily skin
i think it isnt a good pair with my bare minerals foundation
i love how this sinks into my skin
if you use too much it can be a bit oily
great for lips of you are wanting to put a liquid lipstick on
it doesn't make my oily skin any more oily
i'd recommend not to put it on the focal points of your face if you're really oily
it cuts down how oily her skin becomes during the day
i notice around my nose stays moist longer than before
it did wonders for my dry skin.
my lips didn't dry out at all
i still have oily skin no matter what
does not leave any oily residue
once the product is dry on my face
didn't cake up like it normally does under my eyes
i didn't really notice much of a difference than when i moisturize my face before i use a primer
this is coming from someone with seriously textured
is how it makes your lips dry when you put in on your lips
i like putting it on my dry lips too!
my face tends to get oily
stick so much longer without as having soo many touch ups
hopefully not this product cause it's a holy grail primer when used correctly
it quickly soaks into your skin making it feel like you haven't added any product to your face
for me it doesn't leave my skin feeling sticky or anything
yes you can use it by itself to hydrate your skin
that's why it leaves a sticky film on your skin
once it sinks into your skin you barely smell it.
tends to be more dry
have super dry skin with dry patches everywhere
i do use setting powder too
it is very finicky until you find that magic combination
it's just the right amount of stickiness to lock my makeup in place
light enough to not be noticeable once it's dry
not sticky or greasy
it doesn't feel sticky to me
they all leave my skin super greasy
so your face isn't left feeling greasy or sticky at all
i apply this while my skin is still wet
let it air dry
i don't like using towels on my face
i would classify my skin as dry
i live in a very dry climate
little goes a long way- don't pile it on!
combination skin that can get dried out
my skin doesn't look or feel as though it's being dried out- quite the opposite
this product makes removing my makeup a breeze it takes off 100% of my make up in seconds without causing your itation to my sensitive skin
this stuff literally just melts away even the most stubborn eye makeup without any effort
just make sure you wash your face with a proper cleanser after
it breaks my heart because this balm feels so good when you use it
which was nice because i also sometimes deal with dryness
most removal products dry out our skin or turn it red
there is no residue left on the skin.
i wouldn't recommend it if you have oily skin.
it does make yours eyes a foggy when using
i don't need much product to lather on my face
gets my skin ready for the actual cleanser to do its thing
it does make your eyes a little foggy so just bear that in mind if you use it to take off your eye makeup ifthat bothers you- it did not burn or hurt just made my eyes a little foggy temporarily
it's great that they include a spatula to help you get it all out without grubbing it up with your fingers
the clinique does not get nearly as deep
not tight or too dry
does not burn my eyes
i love that i can dry my face on my white towels after using green clean without worrying about leftover makeup transferring to the towel
does not leave residue
the other down-side is that you need quite a bit to thoroughly cleanse the face/neck area
and i can use it on my sensitive eyes.
once you start massaging it in
after cleansing with cetaphil i'd still have oil or make up on my face
i love this cleansing balm so much--it beats all my other ones
i can't use anything that smells floral on my face because my nose is so sensitive to that
this is gentle enough that i can keep my eyes open while i massage it in
for that extra luxurious feeling i tend to wet a cloth with warm water
i still do that with this balm
then just splash some warm water on my face
after a week of not using my skin did not feel as clean
does not dry my skin out
it's not at all oily on my skin
there's no way to get my waterproof eyeliner off without some rubbing
if you are using micellar water right now
it does seem to leave a film on the eye balls if you get a little bit in your eyes
another thing is that i fly through this balm so quickly
tend to get too much on my palm
it would irritate a bit
i tried this product because i have a bad habit of not washing my face at night
it did a better job than my tatcha cleaning oil!!
i also like that it comes with a little spatula
it removes make up so much better then my other cleansing balm
with my other cleansing balm it was a bit more tricky to get it to wash off
not greasy or 'unfinished' if that makes sense?
doesn't leave your face feeling greasy or gross after you wash it off
which i feel left me as an oil slick
you barely have to rub your face
sometimes i use a face wash after
not oily at all
so the only downside is having to use a spatula to scoop it out since i don't want to contaminate it with my fingers
nothing ever gets off my water-proof urban decay liner on the first
with all that's out there though i'm going to be trying urban decays
this balm cleans well enough that i could get away with using it alone
also not so heavy that i couldn't use it as my am cleanser
it really "melts" away makeup better than any other cleanser i've tried
after i wash my face because it wouldn't all come off
was leery because usually cream cleaners don't wash off easily
this is a great alternative to liquid cleaners because one can travel with it without worrying about it being over 3 oz
it leaves no residue behind whatsoever if you rinse well
nothing felt dry or gross afterwards
my skin is dry so after washing it off i was happy to find my face did not feel tight
this didn't leave an oily residue after cleaning it off
or just make me break out or leave my skin feeling oily
it doesn't burn my eyes or make them cloudy.
i also like that it comes with a little spatula.
i still have a bunch of the belief cleansing oil left
i definitely like this better than the makeup glide away oil pump they have
not greasy at all
noticed they either stripped my skin or left it oily
it quickly turns into an oil that does a super job cleaning everything
doesn't dry skin out
not greasy like the boscia does
my only problem with any of these products is that after taking off my eye makeup i always feel like my eyes are a little filmy
it doesn't burn my sensitive eyes
it doesn't get red or irritated it as much or as easy
would suggest removing your contacts if you want to avoid the balm getting on them
doesn't dry out my skin in the least
i love ❤️ this cleanser it has really cleaned my face up i have not had a single zit since i started using this
even open my eyes without it burning or stinging them when i use this i scoop a bit out with the spatula things that comes with it rub it between my h
just wipe off my face gently everything comes off easy no fuss at all
sometimes end up with a zit or two this cleaner cleared it up within 2 washes have not had one there since
it actually foams quite a bit if you add a little water to the palms of your h
i noticed there wasn't much reviews on this product when it comes to hair so here it goes: i suffer from frizzy hair like many people
i cannot ever let my hair air dry or i will look like a poodle
it makes the bottle almost cold
it's a well absorbing oil that doesn't leave my skin greasy
when you blend it out
using cold water to rinse off as per the instruction is actually more effective/faster than using warm water
does not leave any residue
the instructions have you apply all over to your dry face
it's not like any other cleansing oil i've used.
the rest of my face can be dry
i still have some sticky face creams that i'm able to use up because i put them on
have never been able to find a moisturizer that feels as good as this one without making my skin feel more oily
my skin doesn't get oily right away like it used it
the most oily part of my face
it's lightweight enough for my oily skin to not get as oily as quickly as it used to
or irritate my skin in any way
it doesn't leave my skin feeling clogged or too oily
a moisturizer that gives you the perfect amount of moisture without making you feel oily in the end
am usually a greasy mess by 3:00
cleansers that have been recommended are either too harsh on my sensitive skin or they aren't enough to combat the oil my skin produces
it helps make sure i don't get oily while still giving my skin moisture
it's just the right amount of moisture
does not make my skin look or feel oily at all
i love knowing my skin is also protected from the sun because the last thing i need is a sunburn
sometimes struggle to find a good moisturizer with spf because they usually have a greasy feel that isn't comfortable
the only down side for me is always that they smell like tea
it is much thicker than any of the other origins moisturizers i have ever used
does not increase to oily feeling on my face at all
if you warm it up in your h
i don't mind looking slightly oily at first
this is the only one i've found that doesn't leave a film on my skin
it doesn't make me break out or feel like it's clogging up my skin
it does sink it pretty quick without that heavy sunscreen oily feeling
be careful not to get any near your mouth
i could not get that taste out of my mouth for awhile
when you close your eyes this cream make you think you are in a spa
t's definitely targeted for the gals with more dry skin
it wont give you a shiny white mask.
and it will not give you any flakes .
it didn't give me much moisture
didn't dry me out at all
it tends to get oily in the t-zone
i applied it with a brush for a nice even application
does not feel dry at all.
the first time i washed my face i could actually feel
be sure to use the extra gel on your neck too!
it was not too drying yet kept me relatively matte most of the day
i simply drop some spf on
doesn't help with oil control tho cause my nose is still shiny 4 hrs in
also areas that i have slick oily skin i have sensitive skin that is super prone to break outs
my nose still gets oily later in the day as normal
my skin is much less oily hours after applying
it leaves a nice cooling effect that doesn't last overly long
after testing i'm fairly certain that the reason it leaves others feeling "tacky" or "sticky" is because they are using an excessive amount of product that would cause any thicker moisturizer to take a longer amount of time to sink into the skin
sensitive skin might not tolerate it
the packaging is the usually pompous glass jar that you'll need be able to travel with
i love how it melt on my skin
the only time i feel it gets sticky is when i use too much product
i love that is not heavy on my skin
nor does it leave an oily feeling or sticky feeling on my skin at all
i personally found this mask to be different from all of the others because it only takes 2-3 minutes before rinsing
doesn't burn or irritate my skin
i do this mask then the new plump moisture one from this br
could probably leave it on longer for more exfoliation
no break outs- and i have very sensitive skin.
definitely don't have a problem with my pores
doesn't burn my face or agitate my skin
removes every little bit of makeup while making you skin feel sup er soft
i don't have dry skin
i didn't even use a moisturizer after the mask because you just remove the extra
let the rest sink into your skin
typically dior products break me out
cleansers that have been recommended are either too harsh on my sensitive skin or they aren't enough to combat the oil my skin produces
it's a deep enough cleanser that i feel as if i am truly getting my skin clean
my bioderma micellar water did the same thing
they usually either don't take off my makeup efficiently
it isn't sticky at all and leaves no residue.
this is one of the few mw that i have tried that doesn't leave a sticky feeling on the skin
if you are finding the lily extract makeup remove water like me
not oily not sticky
one pump of this stuff
the oil to milk feature creates the perfect way to remove all make up on the face as well as leave it feeling hydrated
i usually need to heavily moisturize after removing make up
would definitely recommend to anyone with dry skin
i also break out easily with sensitive/dry skin
wrinkles whenever i don't have enough oil on my face
it is not drying at all.
as far as skin texture it didn't work for me
i like the slightly warming sensation it creates when you apply it
then you have the option of dampening it again while it's on your face for deeper exfoliation before rinsing
did not irritate my skin at all
while it didn't extract all of them
even after just one use i don't see as many blackheads
i almost always have to do a heavy moisture treatment after because my skin is generally too dry for clay masks
we both have normal to dry skin with pretty tight pores which makes it nearly impossible to get black heads out of
you apply it to a clean
or it will dry a lil white on those areas where u may have applied too much n didnt blend it all in
it does not irritate my under-eye area at all
i do find that 2-3 days a week is enough for me otherwise i start to get some dry patches
it's a litter thicker than i'm used to so didn't know what to think at first
there wasn't a heavy or greasy feeling at all
it doesn't feel sticky at all
even though its a little thicker than a usual serum its layers pretty well with the rest of my skincare
because it is so thick
it does a perfect job of adding moisture without being st all greasy
i don't need to alternate between moisturizers anymore because this keeps my skin perfectly balanced
they told me i could mix in my serum to make it a day mask or use it as a primer
some days it’ll be as oily as an oil slick
day if i’m more on the dry side: the water cream.
humid south this is perfect for me
for a mud mask it is the nicest to apply
i like to use this mask at least once a week to hydrate
it washes off really easily too.
i usually don't like face oils during the day because as much as i press into my skin
my skin didn't feel oily or overproduce oil during the day which never happens
it doesn't dry out my face
without overly drying it
my skin types is oily with some dry areas
it does so without making your skin feel like any ounce of moisture in your face was completely stripped away
you can feel it cleaning
it does not dry out my skin
it is sort of a cheap bottle like you would expect from a free hotel lotion
it doesnt leave an oily film on my skin.
not 5 is because it comes out of the bottle very runny
if they don't discontinue it like they've done with mild clarifying lotion
it doesn't have any oily or wet feeling
my skin gets a little dry around my nose sometimes with the summer weather
i would recommend if you're not wanting to spend over 40 dollars on a water infused moisturizer
my face sometime feel itchy during seasonal change or windy weather
it does feel a bit thick when first applying to face
through the winter i can get away with using a richer moisturizer
without leaving it dry
i don't feel muddy at the end of a long work day
so my skin is definitely on the drier side
i would not recommend this if your skin is super parched
i apply this after my shower to hold in moisture
the only caveat i have is for people with rather dry skin
i do not have very dry skin
if you tend to be on the oily side
i find it hard to find moisture products that don't turn me into a greaseball while still helping with hydration
which lets me go more lightweight on the moisture
i always know if my skin is particularly dehydrated if my foundation pools in my pores--most typically on my inner cheeks
you'll find it is not sticky once you apply a moisturizer on top
my t area is really oily
it does have a stickiness when you first apply it
it also controls my oily t zone really well.
i didn't find it sticky or to have any type of smell at all
the instant i put on the rubber mask my face felt cool
had that sticky "i'm never going to absorb" feeling
on my chin virtually vanish after using this concentrate without any of the added greasiness i experience with my 'oil' products
helped to clear up my face even if it's supposed to be just a moisturizer??
it does leave a oily shine to your face
this does absorb just as quick as the original moisture surge
doesn't make your skin feel super dry after
it provides a good amount of moisture without making my skin feel greasy
because it doesn't feel heavy or greasy
does not make your skin oily
instead of rinsing right away, let it sit.
so good on your face
can't wait to try the others in the rubber mask collection
i will likely just use around my cycle when my acne really flares up
this mask is everything ✨ make my skin so clear ❤️
i will absolutely add this into the routine anytime my face starts to flare up or i just need to calm my skin a bit
t's kinda hard to get your skin to absorb it all
so yeah this helped by clearing my pores
it did kind of make my skin look worse because those surfaced clogged pores needed to be removed
i did not find the smell of the mask to be bothersome in any way
the serum is a thick jelly-like formula which allows me to play with it a little more without it immediately sinking into my skin
i will say be gentle with the rubber mask though because it can tear pretty easily
where i live now doesn't have much humidity
i cannot speak to this for oily skin.
try it out for sure if you have some small wrinkles forming or aging skin
there was enough serum for my whole face
the seaweed rubber mask felt so cooling on my skin after a day out of being in the sun when i was in miami
it didn't entirely absorb into my skin
which should soak in
the lotion you put on in step 1 left my face very sticky
it is not that sticky with adhering to your face
it does tear easily when unpackaging
not very messy to apply
when i rubbed it in it did still feel a little tacky
so make sure to put the rubber mask
my face is really really dry
they cant be compared with this rubber mask
the ampule cream helps the mask grip to the face so you can carry on your doing your house tasks without it falling off
maybe even eat food
my only real issue was that the stuff in the ampoule is a little too thick
this one i like to do once every two weeks or so for extra moisture
light cream perfect for those who live in the south where is is so hot now
some days it’ll be as oily as an oil slick
day if i’m more on the dry side: the water cream.
t never felt patchy or sticky
humid i can use this as a night cream as well
go without sweating or getting dry/flaky
you have to press it into the skin
if you're just rubbing it in then it will not absorb
gives me enough hydration that i don't get the dry patches either
just right for oily
my skin is 80% less oily than before
my face is no longer oily
if my skin isn't happy with the product i get itchy rush on my cheeks
it's repairing all of the horrible dry patches i've been getting
no more oily t-zone or dry patches anywhere
not greasy at all
water cream was too light for me
it really seems to be best for those with oilier skin types
not greasy at all
like i have with the water cream
it's a light cream that doesn't feel like i have a mask full of chemicals all over my face
a must have for drier skin or cold weather.
i didn't have any luck until i tried a sample of tatch's water cream
sometimes creams break me out or make me shiny after a while
my t zone tends to be really really oily specially during the spring
f you are a combo girl\boy in the hunt for a moisturizer that is absorbed by the skin really quickly
even though its oily
i avoid anything mattifying
it sometimes made my foundation look streaky on areas where i put extra moisturizer
when you massage it into the skin it turns into an almost watery consistency that really leaves your skin feeling light
have an oily t zone with dry areas everywhere else during the summer
no word of a lie this cream has helped level out my skin
my skin doesn't get oily as much throughout the day
my face doesn't feel dry anymore
where i work is drying to the skin
this product helps keep my face from being super dry
typically oily in my t-zone
my skin doesn't feel dry at the end of the day.
you won't get a white cast from this cream.
does not make my "normal areas" oily
some cream makes it worse
my only issue is my skin looks a little oily about a hour after i apply it
when i rub my face to remove the oil i come to find out it was excess cream so make sure you use minimal amount
it really is like a silky water if that makes any sense
you can feel the texture change from cream to water like as you rub it in
i've actually noticed that it helps keep my oils at bay longer than normal
first off, let me say that i have very oily skin.
this product makes my skin feel like its taking a big gulp of water
its so light yet feels like it simply melts into the skin
it doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy or sticky
i would recommend putting it on at night rather than morning because the skin does look oily until it fully absorbs
couldn't find a single pore on my face.
if i wake up feeling extra dry i mix in a drop of facial oil in for added hydration
sometimes these creams are better for me as they actually hydrate the skin instead of sitting on top of my skin
felt like actual water on my face
i usually have a difficult time finding a moisturizer because it's either too drying if it's made for acne prone skin
fresh looking without making it greasy or break out
it doesn't linger too long
until i tried the tatcha water cream
all you need is a little scoop with that spoon
it's rather difficult for me to find a cream that not only caters to both dry/oily
my skin can one day be super dry
i wanted another day time moisturizer that would sink into my skin a little more than what i have
i couldn't stop touching my oily areas because i couldn't believe how well this kept oil away
especially if you're oily
meaning when i wash my oily face my skin becomes tight if i use cleansers for "oil"--
great since i have oily skin in the summer
dries down quicker than anything i've used- this is 100% my new must have face cream
so this made me really worried when the sample said it was for oily skin
this gives me moisture without giving me grease or feeling like there's any any kind of layer of product on my skin
it helps keep my oil at bay as well.
the consistency is like if you mixed a gel
my oily skin can't get enough.
didn't feel greasy or sticky like when i usually apply any moisturizer
it dries down pretty nice
they don't feel clogged after applying this cream
i don't see my face getting oily
my makeup doesn't crease as much underneath my eyes anymore as it used to
i love that it's a pump so essentially no product gets wasted or contaminated
where i'm dry i'm incredibly dry
it gives my skin the hydration it needs without being heavy or making my skin more oily
so hydrating to the point that my skin isn't oily anymore because it doesn't have to overproduce its own oils
smooth without any dryness or tightness like i usually experience 6-8 hours after applying
i wasn't sure that something so lightweight could hydrate my skin the way it claimed
if i'm having a particularly oily day i can't h
am actually able to layer other things on my face where sometimes with serums they just don't sink in
a wonderful base for day or night moisture
they always leave behind a residue on my oily skin
i prefer it much more than the drunk elephant mostly because of the texture
sunday's products for some reason leave an awkward residue on my skin that cases me to break out
the only downside of the product is it burns if you get any product in the eyes
it didn't dry out my face or make it oily after using it
had some that didn't wash away easily
thinking it would make my skin too oily
then pat my face dry then go in with this wonderful oil
then used the cleansing oil to take it off
it doesn't feel greasy like oil at all
it does exactly as sunday states it should: it removed dirt
've always used cleansing oils before because thats the only real way to get off your makeup
when i saw you can use it on wet skin
after i rinse it off there isn't any trace of my mascara or other make-up
instead of my fingers because it is an oil
s to wash my face rather than just my fingers
not completely dry out my skin
i work outside in very dirty conditions
without drying it out or irritating it
i find that this foundation does not strip my skin or make it feel flaky
i like the fact that you don't rinse the mask off you use a cotton cloth to remove it
it absorbs immediately, you need very little.
how it just melted into my skin without feeling oily
i don't think this would be enough hydration for dryer skin types
it almost feels like condensed water on your skin which might take some getting used to
doesn't take very long to dry
almost like you're putting water on your skin
before my skin was dry and now it's not.
someone with combination or oily skin may think otherwise
my face had dry spots that with normal lotion wasn't working
i only put it on the dry parts of my face
now that my skin is soft i might start putting it on my entire face
i switch around alot when it comes to moisturizers because except for the really expensive ones
then scent does not irritate me in the slightest bit
t has been difficult to find a product that moisturized adequately while keeping my face from appearing oily
this is the only oil i've been able to put on my bare skin
without mixing it into something else
most of my face is normal to dry
after one use my skin around my nose did not look nor feel dry
it doesn't seep in too quickly or stick on top of my skin like other products have
almost like a dry oil- wasn't slippery or greasy feeling
you're not left oily-
does linger for a bit after application
cause in my oily- comb skin it was pretty much normal
concentrating on the areas of my skin i know get dry
it feels almost like a dry oil after it absorbs some
which is great because i hate greasy-feeling stuff on my face like some moisturizers
i enjoy using the oil in my skin care routine.
in the summer my skin usually does not like oils
this doesn't make my face greasy
night without it making my t some more oily
it didnt make me oily at all
i usually have more than one product for my dry skin
so first off i have dehydrated skin where after i wash it i can feel right
throughout the day it gets oily
but if you have dry skin it would be very good.
doesn't feel slick or greasy on the skin
not in a greasy form
they made my skin feel greasy or never fully absorbed
free of nasty chemicals so you know it's healthy to use
i always seem to keep going back to this one as a pore cleanser
it works very well for my skin without drying it out
it's very easy to apply/wash off
there's some air in the container still
this causes some of the product to bubble in the container so that when you go to apply to your face the next time it just sits on your skin
the only issue i found was that after the first use the mask doesn't create the full carbonated/bubbly effect on your face
dry on your face
i prefer it as a mask on already clean skin
it just feels more like a typical clay mask.
i made sure to keep the seal inside so that air doesn't get into it
it still doesn't foam like it did the first time
you can't beat the price for a really nice clay mask
deep cleaned well without drying me out a bit
ive been seeking a deep cleaning cleanser for summer that wouldn't suck the life out of skin
no more $92 fresh clay mask for me
it still felt like clay until i added water to rinse
then applying a natural oil for moisture really makes my skin amazing
does not seem oily etc
t doesn't cause any break outs like other heavier eye cream do
you can definitely see a difference in the firmness of your skin around your eyes
my eye usually water with products
it soaks in so fast you don't have to worry about any irritation from using it on the lids
i needed something for the dry skin
i only took one star off because i think clean energy cleansing oil has a better formula
this stuff is my favorite oil wash ever.
my face is usually oily
however if i use a toner my skin is still dirty.
if i could only nail down the rest of my skin care routine
this gives you that deep down clean without the drying
i think this formula is thicker
together these two cleansers do not make my skin feel tight or dry
does not leave any residue
i like to wear the lala on top for extra moisture
this serum does not dry my eyes out like many others i have tried
i put a little bit of marula oil before
as soon as you apply it starts bubbling it's cooling refreshing
i do find it can be drying so make sure to use a hydrating cream on top
you end up with having to shake the tube heavily to get the product to the base when there is about 1/2 a tablespoon left
this does not irritate them as most eye creams do
you don't have to touch the cream with your fingers
it doesn't sting at all
i layer cream over it if i feel like my eye area is really dry
for day, though, this serum is usually enough.
let alone an eye cream
you can pump out of a needle like syringe exactly what you need so no waste
can say it did thicken my skin so my circles are lessened
doesn't take anytime to start bubbling
i like it also because you only need to leave it on for 2 mins then massage
i love it as a pre-mask clean skin or when i want to get really clean deep down clean
this is gentle enough for everyday use
bubbles are very refreshing without being painful or to overwhelming
no burning, as i often get from all face mask.
scoop what you have squeezed out on to your face like you normally would
find it to be enough for my skin as a night cleanse especially in the summer
i look forward to trying it again in the winter when my skin is a little drier
as i find it a wee bit drying
probably wouldn't use in the winter months when i am super dry
i do notice my eyes burn after cleaning my face.
i stick with just this cleaner
it does get a little tight feeling in my dry areas
i've had no issues with package leakage--you just have to make sure you screw the cap on snugly
out of my skin, so dry skin-havers beware.
this is literally just your run-of-the-mill clear cleanser
definitely recommend to someone with normal-dry skin
this is a really nice cleanser that does not strip the skin
not stripped or dry at all when i use it
people saying it's drying i have no clue what cleanser you're using because this is not drying
it also did not burn my eyes at all.
or just use the excess when you cleanse your face
if you tight the cap as soon as you put the product in your h
i prefer it to the bars because i can use it in the shower
i tend get oily throughout the day so this give me nice clean
it gets my skin incredibly clean without drying
its the only one that hasn't made my skin feel weird or break out
then use this cleaner with my clarisonic
however in the hotter weather my skin tends to get more oily
as for stinging your eyes if you don't open them while washing you won't have a problem
it's simple enough to wipe the excess drip that come out after closing the bottle
it has not dried my skin out which has happened with other gel/jelly cleaners i have purchased in the past
other than when i am done washing my face
a little bit does squirt out when you are closing it
didn't have the time or energy to do my usual double cleanse
i did not get that even when i'd open my eyes as i massaged the cleanser on my face
for the people that are comaplaining it burns their guys its a cleanser for your face your not suppost to get it in your eyes or to take off makeup so don't be dumb
also for those who are saying it didn't foam make sure your face is really wet
it's not drying for me
i didn't have any issues with burning my eyes or skin
i love that it has the marula oil in it too.
i like it in general because it is not foamy
make sure you close the lid properly
not dry or tight
perfect for those who are lazy about washing your face
i don't have any problems usually with my combination skin
my skin doesn't get super dry either
cheeks all you have to do is splash your face after
the stick formula makes it so easy to apply morning
i that have a combination skin it diseñar break me out
it doesn't completely dry you out
the ones for oily skin dried my skin so hard i broke out
because i loved the toner so much i figured that i would pick up the cleanser too
i really do not have problem skin- my cheeks can get slightly dry
the product does a great job for oil control on my nose
that's better for you face (chemical free).
i don't find it a hassle to wash my face in the morning anymore
i love how portable this face wash is!
the only downside is that i tend to find the exfoliants everywhere after i wash my face- in my hair
especially in the summer heat
my skin is very oily in the t zone
the rest of my skin is normal
clay doesn't usually do too much for my skin
wait until they're dried
i think the exfoliator works a bit better than the other half
i would have to use a hydrating mask after mud masks because my skin would feel too dry
yes enough to peel it off
you are only going to get 2 masks out of this tube
now when you peel it off it does feel like it's taking any hair you have off too
it didn't feel "tight" as it dried
i didn't think it was itchy or burned like some of the other reviewers
when glam glow released this limited time mask i thought i should try it out
it does burn a little bit on the initial application
its not burn your face off type burn
you know its time to peel it off
yes it does peel off.
it's lightweight enough that i don't feel like i have product dripping down my face in the summer humidity
not only does it make you feel like you are laying in a field of honeysuckles
it doesn't feel greasy or heavy like most lotions do when applied
it's a very warm mask once you put it on
my skin didn't feel dry or tight after
don't over use it, you'll mess up your skin.
when i first apply this mask i didn't realize that you have to put such a thick layer
my pores have literally never looked so good
not as hot as other warming masks
also not drying at all!
use a cloth or a soft face towel to make sure all the mask is gone
because i can tell that i removed a layer of my skin
this mask doesn't completely close them
all you need are the cucumbers!
this did not irritate my skin at all
best way i can describe it is half glamglow mud mask/half exfolikate
it kind of burned because i am used to more gentle masks
when you wash it off you kind of exfoliate with the texture so
doesn't dry out my skin
dry skin that other products cause is a must to give you that smooth surface
it gets all the oil
it does leave a texture on my skin that reminds me of some bar soaps i have tried
my normal cleanser just wasn't strong enough to combat it
don't have to worry about liquids on the plane
i've always avoided doing a deep clean on my face as i always get water everywhere
i even got my boyfriend to wash his face with something other than body wash
not sure if it dries out slightly or what
doesn't leave it to dry
all you do is wet your face
i do not let water get into the container
it makes me think it's breaking down the acid mantle on my skin
i've never had a cleanser that left me with a smooth skin like this one does
like don't let it dissolve under running water
we wet our faces with water
i really like this face wash
also does not leave my skin tight or dry
not really expecting it to cleanse well
you have to make sure to pat dry the ball
if you grip it in your palm then you're good to go
this product is great if you have oily skin it controls those oils perfectly
dry skin not so much.
i feel like my nails dig into it when using.
isn't harsh or drying
tery soft on your skin you can hold the ball
get a great lather to put on your face it is very cleansing which in turn some people can think is drying
i normally have oily skin
i've always dreaded washing my face
i feel as if my face is a little dry
first of all credit to boscia for packaging well cause it is a big 'ol slippery ball so they put a balloon around it for keeping it dry until you are ready to bust it open
does not leave my skin super tight after
of course if you want a deep cleansing you should rub the jelly in your h
it definitely doesn't get my skin as clean as i'd like
careful if your nails are long
they dry too hard
i like how it doesn't harden completely
really like this face wash
great for problem skin i can really feel this clearing out my skin
didn't bother my sensitive dry skin whatsoever
the clay does not dry all the way which i enjoyed because it doesn't leave your skin feeling tight or pulled in any way
the wash off is easier as well.
are non-drying as masks can sometimes be
was paranoid it was going to clog my pores or break me out
it also left my skin a little bit more hydrated although not an extreme difference
it doesn't harden all the way but it super nice.
it does not dry down completely
that makes it very easy to rub around the tiny beads when it's time to wash it off
just the parts i needed to freshen up from a little stress breakout
it doesn't completely dry
don't like the dry
cool while using it
i suddenly did not feel the need to exfoliate in the mornings when i usually do
this did not dry it out at all
this was not drying at all.
once you add water it also makes a nice amount of bubbles
or they make me feel greasy
does not feel heavy on the skin
not leaving me slick
i don't see it making that much of a difference in the canadian winter as i have dry skin
although the smell does seem to dissipate on my skin fairly quickly
this stuff is so amazing in the morning on a freshly washed face
definitely feels like i'm giving my skin a drink of water when applying
this sleep mask is for you
my skin breaks out if i use anything too heavy
i may add a little more if i feel my skin is on a dry side
t doesn't end up on your pillow
it doesn't cause my skin to feel oily
i don't consider my skin to be glowy in the morning
i will say that the spoon that comes with it so everything can be sanitary does make it a bit difficult to get the product out because it's so slippery
probably from the oily nature of the mask
my advice is actually use the little spoon.
it feels like such a treat for your skin.
don't think twice about this being on my face when i curl up on my pillow
don't forget to wear sunscreen if you're going to be outside after using this mask
goes on very wet
when used in conjunction with the watermelon mask i feel like i know a skincare secret no one else does
must get if you need moisture in your skin!
sometimes my skin needs some extra hydration to prevent more oil build up
that's pretty normal when using chemical exfoliants you guys
it didn't irritate my skin at all
it won't be all over your pillow
don't have to get my nails all gross
you do have to keep your face off your pillow for a bit while it really sinks in
just need a little and it absorbs very quickly.
the feeling of locking in all the moisture is the best
make sure to use sunscreen with this as it can make your skin a little sensitive
i don't get as oily during the day
it is not flaky or sticky
you can look a little greasy
it helps if you press it into your skin with the palms of your h
so don't look or feel oily
or feel like it'll get all over your pillow
this completely healed all the dry patches on my face in a matter of days
that was your dead skin peeling off lol
the product does not leave a greasy residue
i would definitely recommend this to anyone with dry or even sensitive skin
maybe a body splash or so.
normally i don't like sleep masks because i hate the feeling of it just sitting on my face
it sinks into the skin enough so that i can't feel it rather quickly
also leaves skin feeling a bit dry too if i use it every night
made it easy to apply to my skin
the mask doesn't make my skin peel as i've heard it has others
which tells me it didn't rub off on the pillow
i really didn't think this would do much for me however applying this before my moisturizer really increases the suppleness of my skin
i wouldn't use this during the day because it'd be too hydrating
it doesn't make me oily throughout the day
it doesn't burn when using it
it doesn't leave my skin greasy
let it air dry
i follow up with another more moisturizing essence like may coop or mizon
unfortunately it kind of has a sour wet?
another downside is that it might be irritating my skin a little
this blown me out that never irritates my skin at all
do not make my face feel dry
it did definitely cause my skin to purge a bit
clear out your skin
you can see small pieces of blueberries in them.
you only need a small amount or you'll be rinsing it off forever
the nice thing about this is that it doesn't leave my skin feeling dry or stripped after using it
you don't need a toner afterwards
is one of few cleansers that say you can use it over the eyes
did not burn/irritate my eyes or my skin
also, it doesn't dry my skin out!!
which is amazing because my skin gets dry with any cleanser
i did not find it too drying
i scrub my face pretty decently
that's cool because you don't have to exfoliate your skin later in the week because the face mask do the job for you
you feel your skin is out of whack
then i lather a bit more
it does not strip the skin at all
it is a little sticky
i do this at night because the hope in a jar tends to have a smell
it feels like you are splashing your face with the coolest most refreshing water
it's not sticky or oily.
creams are usually an instant hit or miss for me
i rub it on my whole face
i still need to wax just as often.
it does something to your skin overnight
you can tell when you wake up in the moring that your skin has a tightness or firmness to it
it is not greasy
nor does it feel like it sits on top of my skin like some serums do
really bright dont know if helps yet to prevent/minimize wrinkles or with firming
the only thing i could use on my face was coconut oil
depending on how dry the weather is
is not greasy at all
also love the fact that my oiliness seems to be controlled w this product
i know oily skin has more troubles
i wish i could get all discolouration away after running out of it
i feel in this case i am getting what i paid for- vitamins in liquid form- they don't smell good-
it's perfect for those who are getting into anti aging skin care
or not use at all on days of irritated skin
found last time i tried to use it it gave me too much moisture
it does not break me out and it absorbs quickly.
i like that it isn't too oily to give me whiteheads or whatever it is that comes up when my skin gets greasy
i guess i didn't realize it would be a liquid because it comes out of the dropper onto your finger like a gel
rub it in that way
this would be my desert isl
it just seems to sink in my skin
because it does such a great job in hydrating my face after longer usage
keeps my face from getting too oily during the day
my skin started looking more dull it just didn't feel as good as when i used it
especially for people with dry
it goes on almost like water
this is not sticky was so ever
doesn't just sit on top of your skin like a typical mask
can't wait to use this in the winter on my dry skin
it seems to soak right into my dry skin
during the really rough winter months i even wear it over my moisturizer
if you pat it into your skin i've found that to work best
i love the consistency of the product as doesn't feel too oily/greasy when i put it on my face
this mask feels so cool on your face when you put it on
left a "sticky" texture on my skin for about an hour
i did not have any reactions or break outs- my skin feels smooth
first off i dont have dry skin
sometimes i love using it to prime before makeup
does seem to soak in quickly
i typically like to use this when i feel like my skin is getting too dry in that area
i feel like it helps contain the flare ups from getting too dry
it doesn't make me oily or dried out
it is one of the only items that can make my super dry skin feel soft
is sort of sticky when it is dry
i saw that my skin was less dry
t may not be enough for super dry skin
it is the perfect summertime product during the heat
it won't get all over your pillow
it is so light weight and not sticky.
or you just don't drink water
i can't stop touching my face with how soft
this is my go to skin care product.
it doesn't feel oily on the face
this night mask will leave your skin feel replenish
apply it as any mask and go to sleep.
helps me fall into sleep quicker than when i'm not wearing the mask
relax with some nice c
it actually feels like there's moisture in my skin
very much prefer this over clinique moisture surge
when i was oily
it's a life saver on my dry patches
i find that using it means i can wear a drying lip product the next day without needing to wear a balm underneath
since i start using this product omg my lips never get dry
i never considered spending anything on my lips for hydration as i stick to chapstick
if you wear this at night it will smear off if you sleep on your side because you'll probably rub your face into the pillow
make your lips worse when they're not
if you don't like the thick greasy feeling of aquaphor or vaseline this is for you
i don't just wear it at night like many other reviewer's i do sometimes put a slight coating over my lips during the day
i no longer feel the need to bite the little skins off or have to exfoliate my lips as much as i did before
i forgot what dry lips are
i no longer have to steer clear of matte lip products in fear that my lips will look dry
despite the fact that i consume anywhere from 10 to 11 glasses of water a day my lips tend to get dry
some nights i do i lip scrub before this
i can see this tub lasting me a while.
my only issue is it wipes off with any movement drinking water
this really is a must try if you have product dry lips
it does not make me break out around my mouth as some heavy lip products do
doesn't leave my lips feeling dry or parched
i reapplied this morning just because i loved the way it made my lips feel while i'm wearing it
i felt like the fresh sugar products were making it worse
this is even better then the dior balm i got.
plumps them like nothing else
they would sometimes chap or lose their color
doesn't soak in or slip off too quick
if you suffer from dry lips or just enjoy sleeping with a balm on at night you need this stuff
while i do enjoy the bite mask
it doesn't leave any sort of milky cast on your lips like some treatments do
i didn't find this too sticky to wear during the day
the only con i will say when it comes to using it during the day as a balm is that it can become very slightly sticky as it wears off
i find myself licking my lips too much if a product has a nice flavor
there were times where even layering a bunch of lip treatments would not help
it did completely get rid of my lip problem
my lips are always peeling because i lick them so much all year round
means you don't have to dip your finger into the pot
they often get to the point that i peel the skin right off of my lips because it drives me crazy
i could never go in public without a colored gloss because the peeling
the inside of my mouth feels without feeling sticky nor heavy
they're back to looking dry
do last night i decided to try some of the mask on my cuticles
i will even use this during the day as a lip balm i love it so much
i wish their water sleeping mask did the same thing for my face
my lips feel amazing as soon as i put it on
etc to give me moisture
they don't help with the patches
i always rationalized that it was just another lip balm that wouldn't work for my dry flaky lips
my lips have been so hydrated throughout the day that i don't even feel the need to use aquaphor anymore
my lips couldn't live without it
this small tub will last you literally forever.
etc even though i don't help matters by biting my lips
my lips are always dry even i drink lots of water
i don't even need to apply any kind of lips balm
this is the best saver for my dry lips
even if i do not put on chapstick throughout the day
just dry to the touch
i can't sleep if my lips are dry
it looks polished enough that you could totally wear it during the day
i am on accutane so my lips are always dry
every time i use it i notice my lips just getting softer
if you put it on during the day it makes for a pretty ok gloss too
i'll never be without a little jar of this
they peel all the time
i go bare face to work too.
not dry or cracked at all
i just love how non greasy or sticky this stuff is
i put it on throughout the day too- i like its' texture
not dried all out
it truly moisturises you lips so that even hours after the product is gone
i love it so much i use it as my regular daytime lip balm
the jar lasts a long time also so don't sweat the $20 too much
i always have a dry skin
i put very thick layer before i go to bed
have really dry cracked lips mainly due to the fact i don't drink enough water
you can even use it as a chapstick
it isn't oily which i hate have oil on my face
i can't tell if it's the product or the weather that makes my skin a little more oily than usual
it doesn't feel oily or sticky at all
i don't have to worry about being too oily or flaky
i did not feel oily after use
it left my skin a bit oily during day time use
i would 100% recommend this product to any one with dry skin or combination skin like my self
especially if you are on the more dry side
doesn't irritate or break out my very sensitive skin
normally i try to get away from any type of gel-feeling moisturizers just because i need something more intense
refreshing when you apply it because it has a bit of a cooling effect
this has so much moisture
there isn't any spf in it for day time wear
does the same job as the overpriced higher end moisturizing creams that tout empty promises which only turn out to be a temporary fix
it's not too bad once it dries
this moisture cream has given my face so much love
it still fell into the category of making my skin feel too greasy
especially for the summer when my skin is mroe dry
i did not find it to be overpowering while the moisturizer was on my face
perfect for people with dry skin
this lotion makes you feel like you're treating your face right
i will start by saying that my skin is combo/oily
definitely more oily in the summertime
is not at all greasy
oily skin + i live at the beach + it's summer time = hot mess
it gives you the perfect amount of moisture without the greasy feeling or look
it is perfect in the summer when your face is exposed to the sun a little more than normal
my skin gets really dry after being in the sun all day
probably won't be the best for oily skin
tend to get oily on my t-zone
not as oily as before
it doesn't irritate my sometimes sensitive skin either
i expected it to be greasy
i am extra dry!
gets slightly dry sometimes
t would be great for dry skin types
the water bank moisture cream makes my skin feel so great without any sign of oiliness
there would be no dry flakes when i put my foundation on
my skin would get so greasy throughout the day
it sinks into your skin pretty quickly while making your skin feel so plump from all of the hydration
there's also no sticky or oily residue left over.
without getting the oily/greasy look
this did not bother it one bit even though the one i have is for normal to dry skin
it does not stick around so even if you are sensitive to scents
yet does not feel too heavy on the skin
is not sticky at all
even in the heat
i personally have normal to oily skin so this would leave me too shiny if i used it in the morning
i would highly recommend this to people with dry skin or people who want a go-to moisturizer that will seriously repair damaged skin
i would really love to see how this moisturizer heals my dry skin during the winter when my skin is most dry
doesn't irritate my skin at all
the only complaint i have is that it kinda makes my powder foundation look a little cakey
once the skin absorbs it does not feel almost
sit on my skin
without making it oily
i imagine it feeling less than pleasant if you use it during the day under makeup
it doesn't leave your skin sticky
my dry skin has never felt better before
i love how quickly my skin absorbs the product an how i feel my skin afterwards
usually i try to avoid products with scents as they react negatively with my skin
did not feel or appear oily at all
i would also use it sparingly as it can get greasy
however the packaging of water bank cream looks nice
this cream has a really rich texture so even with my dry skin i prefer using it as a night cream
it even reminds me a sleeping pack rather than a cream
at the same time i have really oily tzone
i doesn't leave my skin oily
i absolutely love how it comes with a mini spatula to scoop out your product in
i really like using it as a night cream
i believe this is because i have fairly oily skin
may do be perfect for someone with drier skin than i do
or maybe as a winter cream
this makes my face look so moisturizer without being too thick or tacky
i used it underneath my make up to provide a nice foundation
which is something i can't say for the other creams i have tried for my dry skin
i am only giving it 4 stars because it did make my skin a little too moisturized for my liking
i do love this product for my dry skin.
some days when my face isn't extremely dry it can cause my skin to become a bit oily
my skin doesn't feel greasy or weighed down when i put it on
it's also extremely moisturizing while also not being heavy or sticky on your face
you can tell it is penetrating the skin
flaky i dont believe this will be enough moister for your skin
preface: i have normal to dry skin.
are drier than the sahara
doesn't turn oily/greasy after it's applied
i love that it comes with an applicator stick so you do not have to stick your fingers into the jar
you can literally feel the moisture all day
i do get oily in my t-zone
although i am dry
didnt want to turn into an oil slick
i know i'll love this even more in the winter when my skin is dry
its hard to find something that doesn't make my skin oily
i struggle with having dry skin
in the winter i tend to get really dry
the formula is more like a gel that doesn't make the skin oily
one note about this product is that applying makeup afterwards can be tacky feeling
so not slick on my face
opened up my pores by washing my face with hot water before application so maybe that did the trick?
when my skin tends to dry out more
overall i would recommend it to people whose skin is dry
when you put it on your face it seems to just melt into your skin with an extradorinaiy amount of moisture
i am always weary of trying new moisturizers because i don't like my face to feel greasy
this is the kind of moisture i've been needing in my life
so the texture is the same as any other cream is for me
this cream does make my t-zone oilier.
i think i would definitely want try their water bank sleeping mask since it is a gel
t's great if you see a dry patch before a big event or photos
otherwise i would have obviously picked a moisturizer for my skin type
i can get pretty oily on my forehead
i think it would work for people with very dry skin
would always see a hint of residual make up on the cotton pad
it does leave skin a little tight
this is way too drying
my skin has a lot of dry patches after washing my face with this
i love this cleanser because it form up when you message your face with a little water
doesn't make your skin feel dried out or tight
it feels like i've just applied a mask after using it
not greasy at all
i still need a lot of moisture
it doesn't break me out or leave me oily
not sticky and doesn't leave a residue.
is not greasy in the slightest
though most mornings/nights i can't be bothered with the metal spatula it come with
i noticed pilling which is never fun to deal with
my skin tends to suffer during the summer due to excess oil on my t-zone
light enough to keep my t-zone oil free
tip: i stick it in the fridge to help cool down my skin :
i am always reluctant to try anything "lightweight" because inevitably my skin starts peeling
for years i've tried to find a moisturizer that would give the nourishment my skin needed without making me look like a greaseball by the end of the day
some days it’ll be as oily as an oil slick
day if i’m more on the dry side: the water cream.
my go to was always glamglow flash mud which is great
i recommend putting it on with a mask brush to get the most out of it
it has little to no scent with a very satisfying texture that is easy to wash away with no residue or need to use a cloth
this mask did wonders for my skin!
i normally don't like masks because they feel like dry mud on my face
it does not dry my skin out.
it still didn't dry up like a clay mask would
i love that this mask doesn't leave my skin dry or tight like many masks do
i love that it doesn't dry down to a dry consistency like most masks do
used this one time on my combination oily skin
it felt cool and creamy when i put it on.
definitely not warm or hot
using your fingers is probably easier
when you wash it off there is immediate gratification
did not pull or tug at my skin like other masks have
so unless it begins any irritation
overtime i feel like this is a mask that will keep your skin healthy
i can't put my finger on the smell
i didn't feel dried out
you also get a lot of product in this jar
it feel smooth after you applied it on your face
i didn't have any stubborn patches i had to rub out
i get pretty tan in the summer
which is not good for your skin
it has just enough coverage to even my skin without feeling like i need to wear makeup for pool days
not oily or heavy
it still matches my skin even if i get a little sun :
the formula is really cool since it matches to your skintone
it also doesn't make my face feel oily
you really have to work it onto your face for a few seconds to release the tint
i've always been a fan of origin skin care products so when i heard they came out with a tinted moisturizer i had to have it
with the heat it can get kind of melted in the afternoon
i love the finish, it is glowing but not oily.
especially if you need instant firming
found that every eye cream i used before this was too rich for my skin
i hope they come out with more shades so ladies with dark skin can enjoy the product
although i am brown it could work for nonbrown skin to create a tan
the only complaint i have is that this does cling to my dry patches a bit
it still looks natural -- it does not get cakey or mask-like on me
made me look really oily
glossier also wiped off extremely easy as well because it just kind if sits on your skin because it's
last all day on my very oily skin
this will work okay for me during the summer since i tend to use a fair amount of sunless tanner
didn't leave my skin greasy even though i have an oily type of skin
after use i could see smooth skin
felt less dry after using this
i could literally build a good size pile of face creams i have tried
i also didn't mind the viscosity because i have pretty dry skin that doesn't break out
i really like this product it absorbs into your skin very quickly
'm sure the normal bottle is 100x easier to retreive the products contents
not any more after only using it fur 10 days.
if i used moisturizer after i felt like i had too much on
with how oily it is
after 7 days trying this product i can see a texture
i didn't really notice my skin being any firmer
it is a little oily
nor any pimple the next day after using a little oily serum as i used to
my dry spots are no longer dry
around my eye area as i tend to have oily skin to begin with
it felt quite oily when applied
oily skin did not break me out
it does not leave a oily finish which i love
it does not feel like it is clogging your pores which is always a plus
not be next few days after it seemed to hydrate my skin while also making it firmer
i could see it being a bit oily for those with straight-up oily skin
don't usually take well to oils
it didn't make me feel greasy at all
it's hard to squeeze it out into your h
seems a little oily at first
it does go on a bit oily
the texture of this product is a little oily though so beware
i found it to absorb extremely well into the skin
oily with dry spots here
i think another reviewer mentioned it was like their makeup melted into their skin
it does feel oily when you apply it
i truly recommend this product to those with a combination of skin whether it's oily or dry or a mix of both
i think this such a good product after i wash my face with it i feel so fresh
my only complaint is that the mixture is a little hard to get out of the packaging
doesn't make my skin feel greasy like some others would
it did help minimize some texture
it didn't leave my face oily either which is great
doesn't feel greasy in the meantime or after
it did not irritate my skin at all
i like to use it best after using a mask or treatment that leaves my skin somewhat dry or in need of something hydrating
loved that it did make my skin too oily since that is a big problem for me
the texture of the serum is also great because it doesn't leave behind a sticky residue
it doesn't go on too oily or slimy
let me start off by saying my skin is exposed to extremely cold temperatures
but it doesn't linger.
may seem a bit greasy at first
the scent relaxes me so much that it's perfect to use before bed
it might leave people with oily skin oily&shiny.
doesn’t feel greasy or heavy
when i do it's going to be one of those big under the skin ones that look like a huge cyst is about to pop through
doesn't leave my skin overly dry like some other spot treatments i've tried
it will burn your skin.
i definitely recommend this to anyone with oily skin
the title says it all: i never thought i'd find a gel mask that i love for my oily/combo skin
dry skin my entire life
it goes on gentle without a tingle or anything
recently i have been too lazy to apply all my usually layers of skincare needed to keep my skin plump
really packs a punch when i mix this with a few drops of any facial oil i use
it does foam without water like the description says
i like to add a little water
there is no dryness after you remove it
will not over-dry your face
the magic that happens when ready to wash off
a mask that doesn't dry out my face!
i like that this is non drying
t doesn't irritate or break out my skin
fresh without drying me out
gets rid of the nasty toxins that build up living in nyc
they really help get that extra clean your skin needs sometimes
will leave your face extra extra soft!
i really love this product i have combination skin some rough dry patches
one thing i love about this mask is that it made my pores smaller
i find them very drying for my already dry skin
i typically stay away from "masks" because i have really dry skin
my face doesn't get nearly as much or as bad of acne as i normally do
this mask has done wonders to my dry skin
dry like you experience with other masks
so you don't have to scrub at your face
its cooling to the skin when you apply it.
and when i say oily i'm not exaggerating.
the finish is not greasy
i can use this at night too because it provides plenty of moisture
this is best to use right after washing your face
it's either too oily or extremely dry
is not greasy whatsoever
especially in the hot summer heat
where my dry spots tend to be
not greasy at all
wouldn't feel overly greasy or melted
some of it just offered an overnight relief from the flaking
thanks to this mattifying mist i no longer need to hoard them
let it completely soak in to your skin or your makeup will slip
once it does soak in
not at all heavy or greasy.
i can actually feel my delicate skin around my eyes drinking this up
always forget to pack my primer
i love how smooth this applies with no greasy residue
instantly provides the right amount of hydration without the greasy residue some others leave
i like to keep it in the fridge
tingly when you apply it
i don't like a jar for my skin care
sometimes creams can be way too heavy
if you're worried about some eye creams being too heavy
what i like is that the product is not sticky or flaky
they are not puffy or tired looking anymore
i've definitely noticed my under eye area is not so dry anymore
because of the gel like feel.
so the climate is very dry out here
it is not greasy, does not leave white streaks.
however it maybe a little too heavy in summer for oily skin
elsewhere for my dry
i either break out or it doesn't hydrate my skin
seriously the best i've ever tried--transformed my dry skin
the best part it doesn't leave my skin oily
s from sephora for my dry
sometimes i even add 1 drop of this to my day cream
i don't feel oily at all
not in an oily way
letting it soak is important too
didn't do much to repair the flakiness
it's thick enough that it doesn't feel like it dries right away
careful when applying don't be dragging the product around your eye skin that is harmful
doesn't dry you out like other masks.
but it does not dry my skin.
used to have oily skin until i learned to take care of it
i really like using this in the morning because it helps give my skin a glowy base for my makeup
it's hard to find a moisturizer to work with my skin type that doesn't leave me greasy or oily
my skin feels evened out not dry or oily.
i only use this during the cold weather since i have combination skin
no matter how much i gently scrub it off
i actually have a very bad sunburn on my face right now
it's perfect for combo skin because it removes all the oil without making your skin feel squeaky or tight
s are wet when you apply it
otherwise it'll take some effort to rinse it off
was hesitant to use it because my skin tends to break out with creams
on some drier days
it doesn't dry your skin as much
doesn't dry out my skin.
although it does dry your skin a little so maybe not for dryer types
best tip is to put the mask in the refrigerator first to really get that cooling effect your skin needs after a long day
even better if you keep it in the fridge
it is not super intense so you can feel it nourishing your skin without gimmicky chemicals or stinging
i recommend it for someone just getting into skin care or who has decent skin
red something more pungent i think you should go in a different direction
first off, this little tube lasts forever.
it is not greasy
packed so you don't have to dip your finger in a all the time
how fast my skin "drinks" it
will get rid of it while you avoid the sun
i can tell my skin is brighter after using an entire bottle of it
you almost feel like you've just got a facial each time you cleanse
doesn't feel dry at all
not dry or tight
you only need about 3-4 pumps on dry skin to remove all foundation
it's so gentle and has never broken my skin out.
the only tip i have is to use this on dry skin first
if you wet your face first
sometimes i'm even so lazy that i remove my makeup with this then just wipe off excess with a micellar wipe instead of using my clarisonic
especially when used after a warm shower
after washing it off you'll be left with smooth
there's never a muddy mask can do this!
it doesn't just sit on the skin the way a lot of heavy creams do
another positive note: it's helped my skin actually retain moisture
i think this gel heals them because i don't feel that stingy feeling the next day
this stuff made my face so smooth
i struggle with dry skin
my dry patches are healing much better now with this product
if i have blemishes or any skin texture this stuff clears it up in less than 2 days
it is oily and flaky at the same time.
the formula is not drying at all
another great thing is that it doesn't dry out my already dry skin
i usually let it dry
pop pimples basically every morning before i do my make up
ready for make up without any popping of pimples lol
this product has changed my skin completely it's helping to get rid of my scars as well
does not create a single problem as long as i hydrate the area enough
you only get one set of skin
i don't wake up with dry skin.
my skin used to be so red that i couldn't even see my natural color
it doesn't feel heavy on the face
most of the time any cream or gel will make me breakout
it can be drying for dry skin types
for anyone suffering from any type of texture
so be sure your using the correct acids for your concerns
what i like about this one is it's a suitable amount of lactic acid to where it doesn't dry out my skin
it made my skin sting so bad i had to wash it off
it has totally gotten rid of the texture
this never dries me out
i never feel any burning with this product or the balling effect others have described
it tingles a bit when you put it on so give it a few minutes to dry
it's a little drying on me
i've always needed stronger glycolic acid to stay clear of all pimples so that's probably why i still got one here
i feel like it's really working to help clear up some stubborn blemishes
it does not over dry
one of the biggest issues that i think cause my acne is that my skin turns over too fast
i wait for it to dry-
this product feels likes is drying out your skin
it can sting if you have a blemish
not only does it leave my skin smooth
it gets rid of the dull flaky dry winter skin
after having very clear skin my entire life i started to break out horribly in my mid 20's adult onset acne is very tricky to treat
so for those with combination/oily skin that may get dry patches here
it is quite sticky
does not dry your skin out at all
i would recommend this to literally anyone who struggles with any sort of texture or dryness
now i believe this by itself is drying so after letting it sit in for about 15 to 30 minutes i then put moisturizer on
this product doesn't dry me out at all
i find this product to really smooth my skin overnight
i knew i needed a thick type of cream
days when my skin can use a little extra
nothing suited my skin well enough to buy it
i peel on my nose because of how dry it is
t doesn't leave me greasy or oily
i personally have dry skin
one of the workers recommended for my dry skin either the olehenriksen one or the glamglow one
i love the thick consistency it has to it because once you apply it
the whiteheads are hardly a problem because they're so small
this stuff seriously softens my face & i love it.
at one point my skin was so dry that i start getting dry red patches
my skin had been dry before, but never like this.
the only downside for me is that it makes my skin oiler than usual
it might be the reason of a question i have been long wondering: where did the pink stain on my navy pajama come from?
there was no pink stains on my new pajama until i started using this product again
what i dislike is that my face seems more oily at night after a day of wearing
i typically use oil based products bc of my extreme dryness- my only other go to is farmacy sleep tight
dry that i usually can't go through a day in the winter without having redness peel away
if you use too much you will feel a bit greasy.
this stuff works so well when my skin is super oily
i would highly recommend this to anyone with dry skin
usually make up just makes it worse
i get dry spots on my face all the time
it has totally gotten rid of that dry flakey skin
t soaks into your skin pretty quickly for being a more heavier product
your skin will love it
as thr weather changes i knew i needed a bit more moisture
i would highly recommend this to someone with dry/normal/combo skin
my skin is no longer dry or red
goes on like a drink of water for the face
doesn't make me feel like i have too much "goop" on my face
not greasy at all
i don't feel oily or like it's caked on after
combination skin with dry patches that completely disapeared once i started using this
is everything a dry skin needs
i love how it dries so fast
nothing get rid of the dryness like this does
i don't find that it makes me more oily
i believe it is holding in moisture
have finally found a line of skin products i can use without damaging my skin
which is always a little dry
not only does it do a great job on keeping my skin moist
if you struggle with redness this will be your best buy
simply because my skin is so red
make it part of your skin care routine.
it goes on not leaving it with an oily finish
it is light weight so you feel like your skin can breathe
improved my dry areas without feeling heavy after applying it
once it goes into your skin
pretty dry skin in the winter months
good enough at nighttime to give deep moisture
it doesn't linger too long
serums to get rid of them so my skin is usually dry
in the morning when i do my foundation i notice that i don't have any dry patches around my mouth
this doesn't break me out or make me oily
it does not make me oily throughout the day
it fades right after you put it on your skin.
there's something about it which feels a little like its leaving a slight film on the surface of my skin
when its dry all you are left with is the smoothness of it which i love
it did not burn or caused me to peel.
it doesn't irritate or dry out my skin or break me out
that it doesn't dry out my skin
doesn't suck all the life out of my skin
doesn't dry me out or irritate me.
doesn't leave my skin dry
my skin would be a little dry
doesn't dry it out
doesn't dry out my skin
don't usually buy a facial product without a sample first as i have seriously sensitive skin
not harsh or drying
the formula is really nice on my dry skin.
a little of this goes a long way to not only cleaning the face
can not go one day without this face wash!!!
i follow with the truth serum which really locks everything in
my combi skin can't decide if it wants to be oily or dry
i just seem to crave a facial wash like this one
it might be a bit too drying for colder months
it does not strip the skin
maybe 2 pumps if i have on a lot of makeup
cleans well when i use it alone or with my clarisonic
it doesn't leave any residue
doesn't dry my skin.
it's non-drying but gets my skin really clean.
does not strip your skin
my skin tends to be normal/oily in warmer weather
normal/sensitive in colder weather
it should last forever as only a smidge is needed to wash your face
i wouldn't recommend people with very dry skin to use this daily
it will upset the balance for people who are prone to dry skin if used excessively
doesn't dry your skin out like so many acne washes do
doesn't dry out skin at all
i must say that it is slightly drying when used with my clairsonic
what i like is that it does not leave your skin dry like other cleansers
a little goes a long way when used with hot water
it does a great job of washing my skin without drying it out
very large pores for as long as i can remember
it gives just the right amount of moisture
strips my face of oil without leaving it too dry
now i don't face dry skin issues
won't dry my skin out
does not dry out skin
i didnt give it five because after the wash my skin would be dry
doesn't dry out his skin in the process
doesn't dry my skin out.
not too moisturizingits just right for my combination skin
you wet your face
requires only a small bit to make lots of suds.
does not leave my face dried out either
it is a good light textured moisturizer that absorbs into the skin fast if you don't apply too much
it leaves my skin a little bit greasy when i apply it "enough"
it will do the amazing job by keeping your skin moisturized until you wash your face the next time
during the summer time it becomes slightly more oily
as my skin get much dryer
f you have oily skin you'll have to pair this with some other product to control oil
it really does make my pores look smaller.
hard to get off like other clay masks i have used
), it does not make my skin feel oily.
as i'd always felt that my $60 jar didn't last longer than 2 months of regular usewhen i use this before bed my skin looks plum
i skip a primer because this makes my foundation look so much nicer on my skin than most primers
even with a fairly drying foundation like the re
so when you add a primer
i normally have dry patches
totally wipped out my dry patches
i give it a 4/5 star because even though it says all skin types i'm oily
i don't get superrrr oily
love how with hydrates yet doesn't make me oily.
great for under makeup on those dry days or before bed when my skin needs a little pick me up
does not leave any greasy residue on the skin
it works wonders because it hydrates my skin without having me looking like a greaseball
i told them that i was scared to buy any moisturizer since i had oily skin
because it feels so un-hygienic just scooping from the jar every time
i would not use this as a night cream if you have dry skin
it did certainly soften my face after use
my skin always feels the guilt when i try to switch it up
i prefer to use a night-time cream as my skin is a bit drier in some areas
this won't always suffice with the moisture i need overnight
i also highly recommend the sea mud cleansing bar for anyone who needs a face wash
you only need a little dab to get the job done
just takes a while to "sink in" without causing pilling when other items are applied over it
especially for those who feel constantly let down by moisturizers
oily in t zone and dry everywhere else.
this moisturizer when you put it onto your face in an instant you will feel that cool feeling
live in a dry/cold climate
it provided really nice moisture
it's a nice thick consistency without being too heavy or oily on my skin
but ill never go back to another moisturizer!
doesn't leave me with a greasy film after application nor melts off my face
this is definitely helping without causing a greasy finish
dryness has been going away for sure
it's the only cream that doesn't make my skin oily or cause breakouts
when i wear it under my foundation i feel like it sinks into the skin perfectly
then again my skin is on the dry side
i personally find that it's enough moisture for my combination skin
doesn't irritate skinor dry out.
i don't feel extra oily afterward
it does not leave any residue or stickiness.
my skin does not seem to be so uneven
find this best for cooler weather only under makeup
not the best when it's warmer outside
this is an oil free product that doesn't dry out my skin like a lot of products
my skin does not create more oil
do not have to wipe the oil off my face
it doesn't make my already greasy skin anymore greasy
one pump is enough to cover my entire face
i don't think dry skin owners can use this on its own as a daily moisturizer since it is a bit too light-weight
in an environment where my coola bb cream was not cutting it for daytime moisture
since my face isn't terribly dry in the summer
i still can't get all the product out like i can with an eye dropper
not sticky going on
it is hydrating which surprised me because i expected it to be drying
then the stickiness shouldn't be a problem
i sometimes mix this with the youth face oil
i wonder if it just aggravates certain skin types
you can almost feel it sinking into your pores
also absorbes really quickly into the skin adding a sticky nice feeling that absorbs your moisturizer right away
t wasn't absorbing well into my skin
it does not flake or crumble under my makeup or cause extra oiliness
this product does not dry out my skin or cause my to breakout
my blush doesn't soak into dry skin anymore
your lips will never be chapped ever again!
i definitely recommend this if your skin needs a little boost of moisture
because of my oily skin i can get scared a product like this could give me more shine than glow
it is a little sticky at first when you apply it
even when i moisturize my face usually feels tight bc it's kind of dry which causes me to produce more oil
my skin just drink this up
it really helps spread the serum all over my face
however i find that it does make my skin matte
it goes away as soon as you rub it in
sometimes it left a greasier finish under my makeup
this product really helps keep my oiliness at bay for most of the day
it keeps my skin from becoming oily during the day
so for someone who is super oily
i like that it is not too mattifying on me because it doesn't make my skin feel stripped
its thick enough at the right amount
does not make my face feel oily or greasy
i can get dry flaky patches in one spot
without risking looking like an oil slick or just use a thin layer if needed
doesn't feel mattifying immediately
usually don't have to use a primer before applying my make up
it is non-greasy
i think that is just because it was bringing up all the deep seated "guck" in my face to the surface to get rid of it
my face is less oily throughout the day
my face gets very oily within 2 hours until julius
no sticky oily skin for me!
i really do recommend ole henriksen to everyone that has combination to severe oily skin
doesn't dry me out or make my skin any more oily
the spot treatment i used from the dermatologist made part of my face peel like the sahara dessert so 90% of my face could cook an egg
etc to try to calm down how oily my skin gets
this product is perfect for anyone with oily skin
i no longer need to blot away excess oil way from my face
i am so happy that i am finally able to wear dewy products without looking like a total grease ball
it's like giving your oily skin a drink of water without any consequences
not make my t zone greasy
if the lotion is even the slightest bit too heavy
it is not greasy nor does it leave my face feeling tight like so many mattifying lotions do
this one smells like it's cleaning my skin while i put it on
i think i like this more for my dry skin
this made my skin a bit oily during the day
or your face will be greasy.
great if you have oily skin!!!
it does leave it soft
i only like to wear it during the day though as i feel it isn't intensive enough as a night time moisturizer
doesn't feel heavy after i apply it
it seems to provide my face /neck with the perfect amount of moisture
without making my skin oilier than usual
it doesn't make my skin produce less oil
this seems to do the trick without making me feel oily or break out
i stopped using a moisturizer for several months cause they all made my face very oily
combination skin that tends to be oily in the warmer months
if you pop it in the fridge it'll make the texture much better
i normally have oily skin in the summer
a drier skin with an oily t-zone in the winter
it gives me the perfect amount of moisture for my combo skin without making my oily t-zone too oily
it does not leave any kind of oily residue or shine on my face
it definitely doesn't make it oilier
not greasy at all
when i am under stress at work my face pours oil
the products do not make your skin feel dry either
i prefer to use it as a night creams just because it really stays on
it was a tad to thick for me even though i needed intense hydration
no more oily skin and make up last all day.
the only reason i gave it 4 stars is because it doesn't do much for your complexion apart from the radiance-
nose dry or they are too heavy
no break outs and no dry skin.
this does not make my face oily.
however i refuse to pay over $35 for a decent moisturizer
if you use too much it will make your face oily.
i love how effective this moisturizer is on the dry areas of my skin without making my forehead/t-zone greasy
it feels great for those who have dry skin
my skin is dry only if i don't use it.
will always be dry
it is extremely thick you have to warm it up a bit in the palm of your h
great for dry skin like mine
let's face it ladies after sixty taking care of your skin only gets more important
i wish it wouldn't have made me break out as i have some small dry patches on my face that could use this intense moisturizing cream
my skin starts to get so dry
i can even use this in the hot humid summers without breaking out or feeling like a mask is on my face
the beeswax needs to be warmed up before applying or it is rather difficult to use
so skin does't dry out too much
my skin has gotten dry as i've gotten older
it's more of a balm that you warm up in your h
finally a product that delivers extreme moisture to my dry winter skin without making me break out
then you rub it between your fingers to warm is up
then pat it in to your skin
is the only thing that works on the small very dry spots i get on my face
will also plump the skin up giving it an instant mini lift if you have any wrinkles or fine lines
proper application consists of warming about a pea size amount on the tips of the fingers until it's actually clear
you need to warm it between your fingers
usually most creams tend to make little difference or evaporate quickly
i am usually oily on my nose
i live in the desert so my skin tends toward the dry side sometimes
i swear it makes my face firmer
yet does not make me look shiny/oily
if you struggle with dry skin
it felt very thick and did not really sink in.
i love that it's not sticky or has any tightening properties to it
it might feel like you have gobs on your skin
this cream is really thick going on
it can be a little greasy
spreading it evenly on your face because a little goes a long way it is pricey
i get flaky, dry combo skin in the winter.
or my skin has taken a moisture hit it's my go to
it is not greasy or oily
now have dry skin as i live in a northern climate
just in my really dry areas
then pat it on your face or press it into your skin
patting until you feel it has absorbed
its awesome for the winter especially when my apt is full of heat
the more i appreciate how well it moisturizes without being greasy
does go on greasy
to use you have to rub it between your fingers first to activate the formula
it keep those areas moisturized so that during the day i don't have to worry about dryness in those problem areas
it doesn't leave your skin oily at all
specially in this winter i felt my face is very dry dry dry
my skin doesn't dry anymore all day
this doesn't make me oily at all
tend to leave a feeling on my skin -- like something extra is on there
one of the side effects of acutane is really dry skin
not only on your face but your lips too.
i wanted something that would keep the dryness at bay
i recommend that you use this in the nighttime so your skin has time to absorb it
when you rub it between your fingers before you apply it
it does not feel extremely oily
it does sink in after a bit
it also doesn't irritate or cause my sensitive skin to break out
it can be a little greasy
it is meant for really dry skin
i really prefer the fresh repair
my skin tends to get dry especially in winter
because it is so thick
i find it a bit heavy
it doesn't burn even after using a scrub.
i usually use regular cream for my eye area too
it is difficult for me to find that moisturizer which will moisturize without turning my face into an oil slick by mid-day
my make up is wearable well into 12 hours without using any powder to touch up
they won't smell like flowers bc they are concentrating ingredients to help your skin not your nose
it is a little too heavy for day
it does dry down quickly
does not leave a sticky residue
feel confident that is has the ability to soak into my skin all night
only thing she complained about is being a little too greasy
not sticky at all
it truly is like giving your face a drink of water
prefer to use it in the colder months
this cream has never made my skin burn
so far it hasn't clogged my pores which i struggle to find moisturizers that don't
i make it all day long without getting super shiny
air will break down the ingredients in the cream quicker
since i like to keep my suntan in the summer
the texture is not bad either
in the colder months, i get very dry skin.
definitely worth a try if you have really dry skin
sometime i switch to sensitive skin version in winter if my skin gets dry
gives great moisture without making my face greasy
this doesnt burn at all :
not too greasy or heavy
not like rotting fish, but still.
while it really does absorb well into the skin
doesn't make me more oily
not in a tube/container with a pump so you can get every last bit of product
definitely don't rub your eyelids with it or get close to the eye area because it stings even if it doesn't make direct contact
my skin is problematic when i get my period
it does not dry out my skin.
this does not dry out the skin
*note* if you break out using this product it means your skin is getting irritated because your skin is too "young"
not because this product causes acne- if this happens cut back to once or twice a week or this just isn't the right time for a retinol treatment for you
when your skin is ready for one
it is not at all drying
applying this all over had a bit of a drying effect on my combo/highly oily skin
i make sure to wash it off before going in the sun
anything with filler ingredients will cause me to breakout quickly
with this they dry out soon
help me specifically helps in making sure my face doesn't become super oily again
then the skin gets used to it
i will be trying something else for these pesky wrinkles on my forehead
i will probably purchase it again when i run out because it's a great moisturizer that doesn't make my skin oily
that's only if the room is hot or if i'm sweating
there is no perfume added or even makes my face itch like other products tend to do
hasn't dried me out either
my skin doesn't feel so oily everyday.
as i already have oily skin
it also works well for me in both dry/cold
or severly dry out my skin
this product dries out your skin a little if you consistently use it
you can swap out help me with a moisturizer for a night or two
your skin will be fine
i noticed my skin would be extra oily the next day even after washing
does not irritate or overly dry skin.
my skin tends to be oilier in the late spring/summer
if you are oily
i believe this product will help the discolored spots go away over time
i wanted something that will exfoliate my skin over time to help keep any kind of aging at bay
my skin is dryer but i can deal with that.
otherwise my skin is angry the next day
but will dry skin out.
the only downside i've noticed is that it can dry my skin out slightly
my skin started to dry out
this face cream is so gentle you hardly know it works until you see the face cloth
it doesn't aggravate it or dry it out at all
the tube lasts me a little less than 2
it doesn't dry me out
feel like i needed to wash it 4 times a day
i wake up to much brighter skin than if i don't use it
i think it's done a lot to reduce the sun damage in my undereye area
you kind of have to pile it on--a little pea-sized amount for the whole face doesn't really do it
i don't have to wear a lot of foundation anymore to hide the pores
so little that it has absorbed as i put on sunblock
i didn't see any lines forming where my makeup usually cakes
it's usually worse at the end of spring when the pollen count is bad
not oil and perfect for all types skin.
only problem is it is a little greasy/shiny when you first apply it
they can really agitate/sting if they seep into your eye
i don't know if it does much for puffiness or dark circles
most eye products just give me a cooling sensation
i keep this stuff in the fridge
i will never use another eye cream.
it had all the moisture it needed
let it dry a bit
i think it gets great results especially when compared to other more expensive eye creams
doesn't feel oily or thick
creams work better when you apply them cold
i do believe it contains some mica or something of the sort
although i think it's better to use it at night cause it can reduce puffy eyes
trying to see how this combination works on dry winter skin
maybe because my skin isn't dry
i think helps tighten the skin too
if i need extra moisture i put the black tea eye cream over it at night
this baby right here is the butter to my jelly
this is the only thing that doesn't dry my skin out
i can say that my pores are super small now
dryed out skin no more!!
i always use glamglow when i feel i need a mask to really get gunk out
doesn't leave my skin dry
i can really tell my acne or little whiteheads going away faster than they would normally
if you are used to an apricot scrub type of deal that's more abrasive this may feel "ineffective" to you- that's how i felt
my dermatologist informed me i've been sloughing off too many layers of skin -_- it seemed super pricey for the amount of product you get
this clay mask is great for the humid summer months
which i do like because it at least keeps the pimple from not growing bigger if it's super stubborn
this does not dry out my skin
djdny irraite my skin at all its not oily or anyung
another plus is this stuff lasts forever just add a bit of water if it dries out
after i apply this mask they flatten out really well
though i haven't noticed it do anything for my extremely stubborn blackheads
there was never even one day where my skin was acne-free
even though i know i shouldn't for those clean pores
i love that you can use it as a mask or just for blemishes
when my skin gets really oily in the heat
it does not leave your skin feeling tight or dry at all
fresh does it again!
whenever i feel like my skin is acting out
my usually oily skin was more matte than it normally is when i wake up
i loved the fact that the clay dried fast
sometimes i even sleep with this mask on
this one doesn't make me dry when i rinse it off
it's wonderful on any oily parts of the skin or for spot treatment or to help make pores smaller
it will dry down completely
these masks don't really tingle with that slightly stinging sensation so they would work for those with more sensitive skin as well
doesn't leave your skin feeling dry or sensitive
i probably need more time to see if it shrinks my pores
sucks out all my pesky big pores that i haven't managed to get rid of
is definitely worth your buck if you battle oiliness
you could see the result right after rinsing it off
easy clay mask this is your guy
it doesn't irritate my skin at all
even if you leave it on until it dries completely
this mask doesn't irritate me
other clay masks i've used tend to be a bit messy
this mask definetly did not dry my face out like other charcoal masks
that tend to suck out so much oil they leave me dry
most charcoal masks are meant for people with oily skin
this one works even if you have dry skin
although the longer you leave the mask on the more oil it seems to suck out
use retin a which can give me dry/sensitive areas
i love that it comes with a little spatula to help get the mask out of the jar without having to stick my fingers in
once it sets on your face to do its magic it simply just turns into clay
i feel it helps even out my oily t zone
this is the perfect mask to clear out my pores at the end of a hot summer day
feel comfortable using it whenever i feel oily over the course of a week
i would not recommend this if you have dry skin as it will probably be too drying especially in the colder months
i live in a humid climate so that was a huge plus already
after washing it off i immediately noticed that not only did it dry out my blemishes
clean without have that tight drying sensation you can get from other masks
you can also use this as a deep cleaning product when used on damp skin
especially with this summer heat
it comes with a little spatula so you don't have to dip your fingers in the pot
it helps my acne to come to the surface rather than sit underneath
it is not harsh on my face.
don't have any drying issues
not drying at all
this mask is great for that because you can see the dark spots in the dried mask from the gunk it pulled out of your face
it can be a nightmare for my skin.
the mask will be totally dry in less than 2 minutes
i like that it dries quickly as i don’t have to wait around for it to dry
you can use it as a full face mask or spot treatment
i still get oily in my t-zone
i notice i'm not as oily as usual
my skin is on the normal-to-dry side
can get oily at times in my t-zone
doesn't make me feel as though i have smeared grease on my face
may not be good for those with oily skin types.
this does not aggravate my skin
a lack of moisture in your skin causes breakout issues as well so don't be afraid to moisturize if u do break out
if i go too light i get dry
it's difficult to find anything that hydrates right
don't know about how it will be in a humid summer yet
definitely not moisture enough even for my combination skin in a cold windy winter weather
does not leave me too shiny or too matte
here's the true test of time: will it keep my skin balanced during times when my skin goes through it's once a month hormonal activity
spread on face you sort of warm it up on h
it is not greasy.
is not greasy or oily in any way
can't use anything too oily or thick without risking breakouts
not too oily and very good for hot summer
does not make my skin look oily
def not oily which was something i was trying to avoid
i used clinique moisture surge extended thirst relief gel for years because it was the only moisturizer i could use that made me break out less than any other i had tried
yet not greasy or heavy
the back ground to me buying this was that i needed a little more heavy duty moisturizer
while i have very oily skin i can end up being rather dry at times too
i don't really like to stick my fingers in my creams
the fact they uses grapes makes me feel i trust their product
nourishing without any greasy residue or feel later on in the day
my face has not turned dry or flakey
if you want something natural to stave off dryness
have had a really hard time finding a moisturizer that doesn't make me break out
it has been a miracle in this cold weather
doesn't leave an oily sticky film on your skin
however i have really oily skin
it seems to make my skin even more oily
still get zits sometimes although i run dry in some areas
this is the prefect amount of moisture without over doing it
always leaves my t-zone without the “over-hydrated”
it doesn't make my skin break out or feel oily.
no more dry skin =
i like that this cream is not too thick or heavy
the tube should last you around ½ a year if you have dry skin like me
it wasn't too oily after applied
this is the pest product i used it until nowmy skin is so dry
oily creams for my dry areas while avoiding the t-zone
not have to worry about it being greasy
my skin had been really dry due to the weather.
i find it is not quite heavy enough for my dry winter skin
my skin is actually breaking out less
does not make my face oily
you don't have to use a lot of product to get adequate hydration
it is really hard to come acroos a moisturizer that doesn't break my skin out
doesn't make my combo skin oily
then i let it dry
not too rich or too light
didn't clog my oily t-zone at all
really gave a lot of moisture without being too heavy
this cream is not too heavy in the warmer weather
i've tried several "lighter" creams that don't quite get the job done
it isn't heavy or sticky at all
this cream is absorbed quickly even though it is very rich
it does not irritate the skin
i tend to go in with a cotton pad
as others have expressed i just don't feel like it's truly cleansing enough for my acne prone areas
it does not lather
for my spots with more acne i sometimes use another cleanser to make sure the skin is getting a deeper clean
i started to wait a minute after my rinse so that my face isn't as wet
i found that this really helps the dry patches on my combination skin
my skin can get really dry if over-washed
tends to get oily throughout the day
to get rid of the oil without drying me out
it is better than most cleansers because it does not leave my skin feeling tight nor stripped of moisture
it doesn't give you that foamy
definitely clean enough if you aren't concerned about makeup residue
does not dry or make your skin tight
it doesn't really foam up
returning pretty much every cleanser in sephora i found the one for my dry red winter skin
if you are using this just to cleanse your face
during the winter my skin gets very dry
t's difficult for me to try any skin clearing products without completely drying out my skin
find it too rich for my combination skin
would be better for people with dry skin
you just apply it with a cotton pad all over
don't wash it off just let it sink in
here is the scoop- you don't use water with this product
here is why: at night you must wash your face with a foamy cleanser to get the days make up/city pollution etc
if you suffer not just from dry skin
severely dehydrated skin from the climate or where ever you should really get this
i usually will use this on a cotton pad
throughout the day my skin actually looks more dewey
best to let it soak in for a bit before going at it
not dried out so great
if you rub it all off with a towel
glowing skin helps start your day without adding so many other products/make up to your face
i would recommend this for people with dry skin or combo skin
don't have to wash it off, just tone afterward.
i can use it to remove even my waterproof eye makeup with out worrying about it causing eye irritation
eyeliner easily without leaving anything greasy behind or missing bits
you need to use a cotton pad when applying
i found that i do not necessarily have to rinse afterward as it is similar to the cleansing water
it does not make my skin oily
you have to wipe it off with a cotton pad because it doesn't just wash off
i sometimes follow it up with cleansing water to get all the mascara off my eyes
it does leave a film on your skin
this is a facial cleanser you'd use after you remove your make up with something else more reliable
didn't feel dry after this at all
does not dry out my skin
you only need a tiny amount to wash your whole face
it does not leave your skin feeling tight or "squeeky" at the end
i don't feel tight or dry
it cleans my skin and doesn't make me break out.
it did not feel dry
that tends to get dry
i love it though as a final touch to the cleansing routine
still in the "oily skin" mindset
if you're having trouble with dry skin
i live in a very dry climate
at the same time won't over-dry my sensitive cheeks
which i treat as if it is dry
don't expect it to have the same feel as when you are using a foaming cleanser
didn't leave my face tight while effectively cleansing it
now that i'm 49 i needed something a little more creamy
feel with only a single wash
it's not over drying
i might not use it as much during the winter because it is drying
doesn't make my t-zone dry
it's prefect when you use it with clarisonic face brush
t does not dry out my skin
it doesn't strip my dry skin.
if you want the pores to be cleansed then u could also try the black bottle boscia
it is not very drying at all
my face doesn't get very oily anymore
this cleanser is the only one that doesn't leave my skin feeling extremely dry
it's not only for dry or sensitive skin.
super dry in winter
terribly oil in summer
either with or without my clarisonic brush
or else you will take long time to rinse them off
it does not foam up too much in your h
it is not a deep scrubby with particles i have to make sure are all off the face
sometimes i have to use oils to remove what it left behind
then i thoroughly wash my face with my usual cleanser to get everything off
was having a hard time finding a cleanser that wouldn't completely dry my skin out
because you only need a small pump to cleanse your entire face
i did find that it dried out my combination skin from time to time
i would recommend it because it leaves your skin clean
it's helped me bring my oily combination skin in balance
finally i've discovered a face cleanser that actually do what is says
can be oily in the t-zone
this product does make my skin feel a bit dry after using it
not feeling oily for once in long time
i keep coming back because of how well it lathers
i don't even use eye make up remover anymore!
doesn't irritate my skin at all
it can be a little drying sometimes.
usually when i run out of a product whether it's toner
it doesn't dry out my skin
it doesn't burn or irritate my skin
my skin is neither dried out nor oily
you might find the smell off-putting?
this has helped my skin go from dry to normal.
dry out my skin even more than it already was
i also got a chemical burn on my face from using all those products
finally found a perfect daily cleanser that is not too drying or irritating for my sensitive
on days you need a deep clean pair it a cleansing brush
it was difficult for me to find a cleanser that was not drying
not tight dry or irritated i even use it on my eyes
not too much to feel like you're washing your face forever
i really like this face wash.
without being dry or tight
or cause my skin to break out
you only need to use a very tiny amount to cleanse well
the best part is it doesn't dry out my skin at all or makes it feel tight either
never dry or tight
it also doesn't dry your face out
can also be dry
this wash does not irritate my skin what's so ever
really dry in the winter
this is by far the on wash that does not irritate my face
make it feel so dry after i wash it
the best part: it does not overly dry out my skin
i think $28 is a bit much for something that gets washed down the drain
it can be a little drying to already dry skin.
really helps get all the dry skin off.
it does dry my face tho.
it didn't leave me too too dry
i always follow up with argan oil though.
doesn't dry out or make my skin break out
it isn't even bad enough to leave my face red
if you lather it in your h
maybe too drying for my combination skin?
if my face is breaking out with those odd pimples i put this stuff on them twice a day
it is not harsh like the kate somerville in the spot treatment
when it is cooler
it takes care of my breakouts overnight without drying my skin out
i love that it doesn't dry out my skin
does not dry my skin out too much--just the blemish itself
i like how it doesn't dry out your skin
dries clear, so can be worn day or night.
i tend to get one or two blemishes on my face at a time
will help it dry up
it is not drying
can be applied as often as you feel necessary to completely kill pimples
it doesn't burn like many other spot treatments
doesn't dry out your skin like crazy either
so got this spot treatment to avoid drying out the rest of my face
i would say this works as well as salicylic acid for me
i like that you apply it directly to the skin from the applicator so no need to wash h
can see before i go to bed that the whiteheads are smaller
it usually just makes it worse
hopefully i don't have this problem because it's gotten to the point where i use 2 wash cloths to h
the key is to wash your face really well then apply a thin
let the product dry well.
sometimes i'll wash my face with a little baking soda before applying just to get it really clean
doesn't dry my skin out at all!
it doesn't leave my skin dry
flaky like a lot of spot treatments do
for those out there who said it worsened or cause breakouts here is a tip: don't put the applicator tip directly on your skin
apply the product with the qtip to my skin once i've used that i use the other side of the qtip to make sure none of the bacteria from my breakouts come in contact with the applicator
no harsh chemicals to dry you out
whenever i have a pimple that's deep under the skin i use it
i never feel dried out.
this stuff really provides relief without drying or irritating
apply this product under moisturizer otherwise you might see it peeling a bit during foundation application
it will come off like a peel off mask when you rub on foundation or powder
definitely not over-drying.
it seems to not flare up as fast
they always dry my skin out
it is not drying to the skin, and just works.
i can't use any of the other spot treatments because they sting
does not drip that eye accident was me being careless
more importantly it doesn't dry out my skin or make it look irritated
this really does work well when applied after washing my face
this pen is magic when it comes to treating breakouts on my extremely dry
it is a gel like texture so only 4/5 stars because it does tend to pill under make-up
i do notice that i dries up after awhile
make sure you rub this in
it didn't over dry the area either like most treatments do
they kind of eat my skin
a big plus that it has an applicator so you don't have to touch the skin you're treating
doesn't irritate or dry out my skin like other
it doesn't get rid of blemishes as quickly as others
doesn't leave any kind of spot treatment residue or film
what i like about it the most is that i can apply concealer over it without it being patchy
they all make my eyes burn
not too thick it really helps dry undereyes
other plus is that it does not sting or burn!!
it's somehow light enough to absorb quickly
oily skin customers would probably not be too fond this
it does however look "greasy" for a while after application
my eyes are very sensitive to the chemicals in most of them where i would tear for the 1st minute after application
although i am in my mid-20s i still think it's important to prevent the dry lines around my eyes
most importantly it is not packaged in a jar where you have to dip your fingers
i like the dispenser though you have to learn to have a light touch with it
i've tried many other eye creams that feel like they leave a tacky or heavy residue
my eyes get super dry
especially during our cold winters
doesn't leave any residue
definitely took care of those dry patches
it is a good cream because it doesn't sting eyes
doesn't irritate my sensitive eyes or have a nasty residue or ball up like most eye creams
i can feel my skin absorbing it up!
not goopy or heavy like others i've tried.
without this product my eyes are dry
i don't need anything by the next day because my under eye area is so supple
was told it is ok to use latisse with this eye cream
i like how you can use it on both your eyelids
the consistency is perfect- not too thick or too light
i also like that you don't need to use too much of it daily since a small amount is super-moisturizing
i can feel a little tingle when i apply
"spot-moisturize" whenever your face gets dry during the day
i live in a very dry climate
it also doesn't really minimize eye bags.
i don't think it is a heavy-lifter like some other eye creams out there
they would get dry
but it is quite thick and sticky.
like really dry (ie.
anything with spf or a lot of active ingredients makes the skin around my eyes burn
it doesn't feel greasy going on
my under eyes are not too dry
thought i should purchase when i found myself cleaning the little packet with my finger
make sure to drink a lot of water ladies
i am typically dry
that helps seal in all the moisture i need during the day
i go to this for the moisture i need
i've got that flakey dry skin no one wants.
i could care less if it brightens or not
i feel like it never absorbs
it may not good for oily skin.
doesn't really linger through the day
if you're in need of a heavy duty moisturizer that doesn't feel heavy
my face seems less oily when i use this product
you really only need a little tiny bit to cover your whole face
soothing when i put it on
anyone saying this product is thick or leaves residue must have gotten a damaged product
it's not as bad as the moisturizers i have tried in the past
my reason for trying korres is i would like to lighten some uneven skin tone
this doesn't seem to aggravate it
this wound up also being a great way to keep my normally oily skin from drying out
anyone with oily skin knows it makes you prone to breakouts
it does leaves a little white marks if you don't spread out evenly on the skin
i truly believe it's a result of me just treating my skin inside out rather than trying to cover blemishes with makeup
the texture doesn't leave you oily or greasy
others are so dry they flake throughout the day
flake-free all day without turning my oily areas into an absolute disaster
does not linger on my skin
make-up ready skin
texture of your face when you put on make up
this helps take care of those flaky dry spots
doesn't make me overly oily as time goes by
i do tend to just use this at night after cleansing since it makes my skin look great when i wake up
i do not recxomend it for oily skin
i do tend to get drier during the winter
this does such a great job keeping me moisturized without making me oily
soft when i apply it
24 hour moisture - not really.
you may look a little shiny right after applying
it is a little greasy in the summer for my skin-
how many compliments to my ordinarily dry skin i got
i feel like my skin breaks out more during the winter because it gets way to dry
small pores which means often moisturizers either irritate my skin horribly or sit on top of it
a little more in the winter does the trick
glowy i don't know if it'll be hydrating enough for winter
it goes away once you rub it in
i get compliments on my skin all of the time
it is gentle enough to provide plenty of moisture without irritation
as of now i have not found anything better for my dry/oily skin combination
this product is amazing it tightened my skin on my forhead in a matter of 5 days it's like i'm getting younger
it does not make my skin more oily
i would not use this in the daytime since it is not mattifying although not necessarily greasy
it's winter and my skin is parched.
you get all the benefits rose oil does for your skin
doesn't leave you looking like a grease slick after application
i usually wake up super greasy
this really balances it out overnight i get a dewy more fresher look in the morning
the smell is just great i always take a minute after i apply the mask
take a deep inhale it just sends me straight to a nice calm place hehe
it works very well however the consistency is so thick i feel like i'm applying paste to my face
as i tend to get oily towards the mid-day
it does absorb after a bit
even in really hot weather
absorbs and doesn't make me break out.
i do break out from some creams - not this one.
if i need to go outside i just put sunscreen on top of it
i usually don't rub face cleanser over my eyes when i'm washing my face because it always manages to get in my eyes
this stuff is so gentle that i never have a problem with washing in the eye area
i never feel dried out after using this product
also tends to feel really tight after washing
this classic face wash is still my go to.
this is my winter heck my all year round favorite facial wash
though perhaps a bit more watery than i would like
doesn't leave me dry or oily
next to my sink to wash off my make up everyday
this face wash is the first thing that has actually fixed my skin
doesn't leave your face tight or dry
this is literally the only moisturizer that doesn't make my very dry face feel tight
it's not over drying
makes my face so clean without out drying it out
if you want a cleanser that removes all your makeup especially around the eyes without burning your eyeballs
it does make your skin a little tight afterwards tho
this will not dry out your skin.
this one doesn't foam a lot
it will clean your skin well
realized that this product can definetly make your skin a little dry
just a little if you have dry skin
i love this product because it just melts my makeup off
if you look at the ingredients you realize it takes of makeup easily because it is a mixture of different oils
they are either very oily or dry out my skin.
i noticed it doesn't work as well if i apply it to completely dry skin
does not leave your face dry like it sucked the moisture out of ya
this works good without drying out my skin or being too oily
it cleanses without making my skin feel too dry or stripped
my skin s never too dry after cleansing with this product
did nor dry my skin out
does not give any tightness to your skin after using
it is safe enough to cleanse the eye area without leaving a burning sensation
i find it best to rub gently on your face then fan your face with your h
if you are wearing heavy make up you will definitely want to use a make up remover first
it is slightly drying if used more than 2or 3times in a row so make sure to rotate it through your routine
i even use a tiny bit when i have stubborn lipstick on that refuses to come off
this makes my face so clean without drying it out
makes my skin feel really soft afterwards which is unlike a lot of other makeup removers
the stuff sinking into your skin
not drying or irritating at all
i always wash my face twice so this is good as a first wash
this is the best wash ever
works for everyday use without over drying my skin
it does not dry my dry skin
it helps my skin and did not dry it
i really enjoy using this face wash when i'm on the go
not dry or greasy
it has not made me break out or have excess dryness/oil
it helps with exactly what it states "dryness
also not dry out my combo type skin
the difference in my skin is 1000 times better it's soft my pores have gotten smaller it helps my oily t zone
i love this face wash for not drying me out
the best part is i usually break out horribly on my menstrual cycle
does not dry out skin after use
doesn't make my skin feel dry
i still love this face wash n i just use it mayb 3 times a week n load moisturizer on after n it works out great for me :
my t-zone seems to be less oily also
doesn't dry out my skin
it doesn't burn my eyes.
it doesn't dry my skin out at all
i tend to be a little on the lazy side when it comes to removing my makeup
my face does not get dry after using it
this is the only cleanser that doesn't burn when i have broken skin
this did not irritate my skin or make me break out unlike other cleanser i tried
also does not leave a film on the face like some dry skin cleansers do
my skin doesn't feel tight or dry after washing
it may be the clarisonic brush that's preventing break outs
i am so happy i don't have to use harsh chemicals to clean my skin
when i read on the label that it would calm tight skin i decided to try it
this product doesnt make my face feel tight or dry i use it every morning in the shower
it's not drying at all
which makes it difficult to find cleansers that do not irritate my skin
it was way too drying
actually made my acne appear worse because of all the flaky dead skin that was building up
doesn't dry it out
if your skin is inflammed as mine can often be
it's not drying like other products
some products leither leave my skin dry or that i still have dirt on it
my skin is not tight or overdry afterward
my skin is not only clean after i use it
this is a calming face wash gel that really does what it says
didn't dry it out
i don't need to use liquid makeup anymore.
once i wash with this it is calm
make sure you get your face nice a wet
not tight or dry
i can always count on this one to be soothing to my skin
really evens out my skin tone without making it feel too dry
apricot scrub about once a week to get rid of my crusties since this one is so non abrasive
refreshing without being too drying
this cleanser is really getting things under control
it was just what my sunburnt skin needed.
skin never fels too oily or dried out after cleasning
i think from the winter wind
t is oily in some spots
it didnt dry out my skin either
stupidly believing it wouldn't matter if i used this scrub or that toner
at least i wasn't using the same soap that my kids wash their h
everything i used to clean my face was making it worse
this redness relief product is exactly what i needed after being out in too much florida sun
my skin doesn't burn or get red
i don't have to pile on makeup every morning to cover my redness so much
it has reduced a lot of my oily skin
it does not sting or make my face dried out like a lot of stuff i have used before
my face is still a bit dry
i just had the oily skin
i recommend it for oily skin in particular.
i can tell it makes my skin look calmer right away
this is the only cleanser that does not make my face bright red
ordinary cleansers have a tendancy to leave my face a little red
make up with put all the flakiness of other serums i have used in the past
had a sticky/tacky feel after applying
it leaves the most amazing glow to your face without having a tacky residue on your face like other vitamin c products i have tried
now it's almost hard to find little acnes on his face
you definitely need to use this before your moisturizer though because it leaves skin feeling a little bit sticky
don't need much moisture
not either matte or greasy
it is not oily
it helps me with my dry spots on my face.
i know its hard to get guys to wear face creams
its not greasy, doesnt leave a film on your face.
i really look forward to using the face cream before i go to bed -- it spreads very smoothly
they did nothing to the size of my pores
i can no longer see my pores
it doesn't take long for the texture of your skin to change for the better
it does tame a moment to dry though
it must only be used on dry skin
its crazy how it seems to work almost instantly with the pores on
one pump can cover your whole face
the only down sides are that it takes a little bit of time to soak in
not the least bit drying
my only complaint would be that it dried out my skin a bit
as long as you follow it with your regular moisturizer it won't dry you out
i do still have to blot like
can be drying if used too often.
doesn't dry my skin at all
it doesn't burn when you put it on like some other products with alcohol in it
this stuff makes them disappear without irritating my face or making it red
it doesn't make my skin dry
the consistency is really great- not too oily or serum-like
i can tell my pores are getting a little smaller
it does do a little bit to make pores less snoticable
my skins rarely breaks out now as long as i use this product
when you put it on your nose
it'll almost feel like you are putting on alcohol or a toner
you need very little to cover your whole nose.
it seems less oily than before.
it doesn't sting or burn
i don't feel that this dries me out
it is not over drying.
it does go on a bit sticky
which makes it go on better than if your skin is slightly wet still
gave it four stars because the sticky-like liquid sort of takes a while to set
my skin did not feel dry at all in that area.
it does dry your skin
it is a little sticky unless you let it dry for a while before applying make-up over it
i believe it has cleaned out my skin.
the amount of time it lasts on my skin depends upon how oily/sweaty i am
skin does not feel too tight after use.
washing the face with different products doesn't help much
as long as you continue to use the product on a regular basis you will see your pores tighted
even though i have dry mature skin
i don't know if it is making more pores less noticeable
i asked the sephora employee for a product that would suck all the gross stuff out of my pores
my skin never gets greasy during the day
as it really gets every drop of oil out of my skin
not too thick but not too thin.
much more sanitary than something you'd put your fingers in
i feel like the container makes it
i really hope they change the container to a regular jar
i definitely avoid the oil mixed with a moisturizer in the summer because the combination is too heavy for me
one day my skin being to literally drink the bb cream i put on my face
you only need 1 pump to cover entire face.
i get red if i'm too hot
claiming that it would lock in more moisture
don't know how my skin will react to this as it gets warmer
great for my oily
i love the packaging to keep the cream from becoming contaminated which also causes problems for touchy skin
all the other face creams i've tried either dry me out or make me more oily
it is extreme combination -- very oily in the t-zone
it moisturizes my face without making me break out or making my eyes water
not at all greasy
at first glance it looks like another tub you have to stick your fingers in
i say that it helped w/ my dry patches skin
lots of $$ for moisturizers that either irritated my skin or laid there
"how can my skin be aging
it doesn't make me more oily
i don't use this as my sole face cream -- only a few times a week when i feel my skin needs it
it doesn't seem to irritate my already angry skin
they always perscribe me with products that dry out my skin terribly
it is not oily or sticky in consistency.
it feels as if i have chile on my face
it nothing for the dry
my whole face is well moisturized without being too oily or breaking out
even in the summer this product does not make my face feel greasy at all
having a wax that same week did not help
the new package is even better cause you dont contaminate the cream with your fingers
let is absorb in
doesn't get bitty when applying make-up over it
it does sting a bit when first applied
it tingles/burnes a little when you apply it
it made my bags very dry
is neither too greasy / light not too thick
no cream out there will get rid of the darkness completely
i don't feel like it helps with fine lines/wrinkles at all
i know it is supposed to be a deep cleanser used only intermittently
wet it to apply on my face
the clay comes off very thick which is great for applying it on my body
it's very messy if you take it in the shower with you
so avoid getting it completely wet
the next i can be dry with minimal blemishes
all i do is wet the brush
you can see the mask pulling all kinds of dirt
if my skin is acting up or if i notice more pronounced breakouts i put this mask on all over
will wear it as a mask if i'm feeling oily- its amazing
i like that i can apply it in the shower
this is my go to mask when i want to clean out my pores
it really clears out my large pores that always have gunk in them from just basic makeup
occasionally leave it on longer to dry as a mask
get my skin to clear up
i can't give it 5 stars b/c when you wash it off it literally goes everywhere making your sink a mess
then after a while the soap gets dry
while it can be messy
gets rid of all the dead skin build up for a super smooth face
you don't have to worry about it washing down the drain if you keep it dry
my face us the oiliest face of them all
as its a bit over drying if i use it everyday
she lets me rub her down with a paste i make from this
it is really strange to get used to though-- you have to get your entire face wet
the entire bar wet for it to go on well
it dries really fast into a cement like block-- so there's no mess at all
i let it dry then rinse off immediately daily.
if i feel more oily than usual i leave on longer
nothing else would do it prior to this bar of clay altho it is slightly overy drying to some parts of my face
i just dont put it on the areas it dries out
ing up in a small bowl of water to get enough product to cover my face
then i wet my face completely
i usually make a couple of passes to get the level of clay on my face that i like
i let it dry completely
all i do is lather up a section of the bar
it doesn't over dry my combination dry skin
leave my back wet
let it air dry or blow dry.
just be aware that your acne will get worse at first as it pulls the impurities to the surface
i let it dry for 3-5 minutes then rinse
i'll put it everywhere that my skin is acting up
leave it in a cool, dry place.
a little drying at times
i tend to use this as a mask
/or my skin needs to "calm down"
read some suggestions to wash your face everyday with it
get the bar wet
then wet the bar
rub on my face then let dry
you can see oils
lasts a long time when i take the time to drain my soap dish between uses
i love what this does for your body in the shower
i usually just run it along my skin
make sure you have a separate soap dish for this bar
i find it to be too drying to use on my dry skin in the colder months
all you need to do is let it dry on a soap dish
four stars cause i can't make it thicken up more on my face since its not in a tube
it also did not help with my back or chest acne as much as my face
it doesn't dry me out
even in the winter when i am prone to very dry skin
it also doesn't make my skin shiny/over-produce oil like some products do to me
so don't scrub with it
or you'll irritate your skin
i like to turn my shower into a kind of sauna
the trick here seems to be to run the bar under only hot water
just make sure you don't smoke a cigarette
then let it dry
i love that i can also use it on my body for back acne
there is also a tube version that you can mix with your facial cleanser which a lot of ppl seem to get good results from
rub the short end on my wet face
i rub the short end of the bar all over my wet face
initially i used it everyday or when my skin is feeling very clogged/ dirty
use warm water to soften it or it will be too harsh to rub directly on skin
no more slick of oil when i wake up
as long as i am mindful of following up with a thick lotion
then get a part of the bar wet
i think that this works best because when i wet the actual bar
it provides moisture while still controlling excess oil that i tend to get in my t-zone
if your on the fence/skeptical about a simple bar of clay working wonders on your skin
leave it on to dry as a mask
i would recommend it especially for oily skin
it can be a bit drying in a couple of places
that is not a problem that a little bit of moisturizer couldn't fix
that you mix with water
i like it because it doesn't burn my skin or that strong "cooling" minty effect
i either leave it on for 20 mins to control my oily t-zone
just be careful not to rub directly on your skin
i just wet the bar
give it about 5 minutes to dry as a mask
doesn't leave the skin too dried out afterward like some masks can
doesn't over dry like most masks.
my skin was getting much more oily with the humidity here
repeat), massage a bit, then let sit until dry.
it clears any pimples as well as dry area that you may have
just splash some water on your face
hold the dry side, no mess.
it is difficult to get a good lather for the face w/o other areas starting to dry
this bar is too $$ for me to use in the shower
everything i have tried has either made me oilier or made my acne worse
this bar does not dry out my skin at all.
i love how it doesn't have all the extra synthetic ingredients in it
i can literally see all my pores while i wait in the 5 minutes
i don't know if this claims to clear acne or brighten the dark spots on your skin
if you guys suffer from sensitive dry skin like mine
keeps my skin from drying out too much
it does not leave the skin feeling dry or oily in anyway
doesn't dry out my skin
which is already dry
also doesn't leave my skin dried up
i would use it on my face after going in with micellar water
definitely will need a micellear water pad to get make up off before you go in with this face wash if you have a full face of make up
you truly feel like you're improving your skin with every wash
doesn't dry my skin out
with other products i feel my skin like paper its feel really dry
this product doesn't dry my skin out
it is not drying
it doesn't strip my dry
this is the only cleanser that doesn't make it redder when i get out of the shower
sometimes gentle cleansers won't really do anything for your skin
this cleanser has not made my face feel dry/tight so far
which helps me get a deeper clean without a scrub or harsher chemical
you only need a tiny drop for this face wash to work
not to mention this face wash easily clears my skin in about 2 days
takes away excess oil without leaving my skin dry
you will never find a better face wash.
it's gentle enough that it doesn't strip my skin dry
it is the only face wash i have ever used that doesn't irritate my eyes
there are plenty of good cleansers out there
i can continue feeling like laura ingalls running through the wildflowers when i wash my face
your skin purges for a few weeks when you add a product you haven't used
my face doesn't feel dry i just use my oils at
doesn't dry my already dry skin out
i wanted to stray from overly chemical face washes because they did more harm than good
very oily in other areas
doesn't over dry and doesn't make you oily.
doesn't over dry the dry areas of my skin
it doesn't foam up a lot
doesn't leave my face too dry or oily
wasn't convinced at first because i usually like really strong pore cleansers
so face washes that are too aggressive cause me to break out
fresh products really agree with my skin
i love it as a quick wash face wash.
it doesn't dry/strip my oily skin or make me break out
and it doesn't leave any residue behind.
it very easily cleaned off my eye make-up
my skin is so clear, clean, and less oily even.
i didn't used to be able to step outside of my house without at least a good cc cream covering my redness
my skin is a mess without this stuff
i love this product, but my skin gets oily a lot!
it's nice to use a cleanser that does not make me immediately run for moisturizer to get rid of that tight
it can dry out in a flash
this does not dry out my skin.
(keep in mind it doesn't foam right away!
it doesn't strip nor overpower my skin
it does not irritate your skin
it does not leave your skin dry
a couple things to mention: if you don't like a cleanser that doesn't produce a lot of foam
i generally find face cleansers that don't produce a lot of foam hard to wash off from you face
it is easy to wash off
doesn't leave me dry
it does tingle a bit when first applied
i find that it does not leave your face feeling uncomfortably tight like some clay masks tend to do
never find that it makes my face too dry
it does dreg up all the dirt
t did cause some new breakouts from pulling everything up to the surface
enough to make my eyes water a lot
i leave it on until it dries
it does sting a bit when you apply it from the mint attri
i'd rather have my face feel cool than burning hot
upon washing my face i would say maybe 20% of clogged pores were gone
if you already have dry skin this might irritate you even more
this mask does tingle quite a bit like the other reviewers have said
i just grit my teeth because the results it gives are so good
this is everything i want in a clay mask.
it stings/burns when you first apply it.
i wash it off in shower with no problem.
i suggest you wash it off in the shower because it's very red
might ruin your sink
let me tell you that this is seriously the best mask for removing blackheads
i would really recommend this mask to anyone struggling with blackhead removal
it's also great because it doesn't have any harsh chemicals
feels like it's getting all up in your pores to clean them out
it obviously gets a little itchy while drying
similar to the algae cleanser that anthony makes you can feel the this stuff doing what it says its doing
doesn't leave skin too tight
soft without that oily skin you can get after using a mask
it doesn't get tight like other clay masks
this product does "burn" a little bit for a very brief period
he has more oily
while his extra oil may help him not get wrinkles
he somethimes doesn't like the extra shine
if you wash it off in the sink
this didn't dry my face out at all
it did not dry his skin out
my face will start oily especially at my t-zone
i don't have to wash my face a lot
this stuff keeps my skin in check
although it takes longer to dry
well when it is done drying just make sure you wipe completely off because otherwise your face looks flushed
i don't think it would dry out someone with not-so-oily skin
unless you have really really dry sensitive skin
so you may want to use a moisturizer as soon as you have washed it off
just generally less oily
-alone product if i want a softer cleansing
rinsing with water can be really harsh on my face
that squeaky clean feeling many like in their face us actually causing damage for you
have searched for years trying to find a face wash that didn't irritate
this is the only wash i have found that does not irritate or dry out my skin
which tends to be much oilier than the rest of my face
in my 20's their oily skin line was the one thing that would clear up my acne
now in my 40's the cleansing milk is the one thing that leaves my skin soft without causing breakouts
i can use it on my eyes without irritation.
without drying me out further
the only downfall is that it squirts out too much product in the beginning
only use them to soothe my skin when it's dry
does not dry out my skin
it actually does work to pull all kinds of gunk out of your poors
can make t-zone looks oily
i tend to use this in the winter as its pretty creamy
i am in my 50's, and my skin is drying out.
i do this whenever my skin feels clogged up.
probably because it is not abrasive enough
don't expect it would remove waterproof make up completely
it's a good cleansing milk for dry weather if you don't have heavy make up
its not oily or clogging like alot of dry skin products
when combined with the scrub it works even better
my face doesn't even tight after i use it
i think it has a tendency to clog my pores over time so now i use it only as a backup to another cleanser
it doesn't dry out the skin
clean and soft but never dried out.
after washing my face i didn't have the dry
soft and not dry, but feel not too much clean!
drying feeling i get from others
does not dry out or iritate my sensitive skin at all
i wet my face with tepid water
with no residue- no need for a cotton pad after
even though it is meant for use on dry skin
but you do get clean, soft skin.
i can see how this moisturizer doesn't work for other people as it is quite thick
i think the people that are finding this moisturizer too sticky or heavy are possibly using too much
is not heavy or sticky feeling
now, my skin feels dry all day long.
when i apply it it is easily viable that my skin is left with a matte glow which is nice for those oily girls like me
i love this product its perfect if you have small pores
worked really well for getting rid of oily forehead during the day i would mix it with my foundation for a light weight kinda of feel
i hate having oily skin.
the first time i used it i was so oily
i also use it at night for moisture.
then the rest of my face is either normal or dry
doesn't make me break out or too dry
it controls the oil but doesn't dull the skin.
can give me a headache silicon feelingoverall: not the most hydrating product i have ever used
some dry patch on the forehead/even on my cheeks that get worse with winter weather or hot water or even some soap
not so much that it makes my skin greasy
i prefer a matte finish so this worked really well at hydrating my skin without making me look greasy
absolutely a necessity for anyone with oily skin!
this doesn't make me oily throughout the day
i will say that i don't really notice that glow too much after spraying my face
i don't think this product would be good for super dry skin
have never found a moisturizer that actually does it's job well
it doesn't feel too heavy or oily
it cleared up all my dry skin
it actually helps your makeup glide on easier because of it
doesn't make my skin oily at all
works great on my combination skin because it moisturizes without bringing out the oiliness in my t-zone
because i have oily skin
i definitely recommend trying a sample if you have oily skin
it does indeed provide all day moisture without oiliness
one thing is that the texture is dry
i didn't feel naked it makes your skin feel poreless
definitely recommend for humid places like hawaii
its hard to find good product that lasts in our humid weather
it won't keep you matte all day
it doesn't go on greasy or feel oily
helps not make it so oily
but all year, dry skin.
i know this product might steer some away who have dry skin
i love to wear this when i am not wearing make up because it absorbs fast
my face never looks dry with this on with/without make up which is a huge bonus
skin does not get shiny
you feel as though you aren't wearing makeup at all because your skin feels so moisturized
you know those little clear plastic jars that look like caps?
well she filled it almost full unlike the other stingy employee that didn't give me enough of a glam glow mask to even try it despite it not actually taking anything from her
's t zone which is just as greasy
this never dries me out to the point that my face feels dry
it's also obviously water based which means it dried down quickly
t's not oily nor is it dry
i found it to be sticky
it makes your skin smell like a cake in my opinion which i feel could be slightly off putting
there's only two or three moisturizers i've ever used that haven't broken my skin out
i decided to give this a go hoping it would moisturize my skin enough that it would get rid of some dry patches i have going on
i didn't love it underneath makeup seeing as it did not keep my skin matte
if you are someone with dry skin this moisturizer would work perfectly for both am
it does not take long to sink into the skin at all
i don't think i'll ever use regular moisture ever again
it's kept me matte all day with no setting powder
i personally don't love the becca primer because it sometimes leaves my skin looking super dry
either over a toner or serum or something else to help it glide over the skin better
soft skin without the drying itchy effect other products can give u
highly recommend trying for someone with oily skin
i can't say that this made my skin stay completely matte all day
our skin tends to be more oilier than most races.
it didn't completely suck the life out of my face
made it look dry
it mattifys my skin without over drying/looking dull or flat
my nose can get oily throughout the day
i don't have oily skin
i usually have very dry skin to where my forehead would peel
never any oily type residue
i typically have dry skin
does not irritate my skin at all
it feels a little bit sticky after apply
right after you apply the serum to your face your skin feels alive
it is light and not heavy or oily on the skin.
as someone who has oily skin
i don't like using a lot of serums because they usually make my skin even more oily
so the skin would peel-off -- it certainly did peel off
it was not oily at all
my only complaint is that sometimes the serum feels kind of tacky or sticky on my face
my fact illuminates but not like oily or greasy.
it still wouldn't feel greasy or even look oily
they do not make my skin too oily
acne prone skin that doesn't usually get dried out in this way
it is not too sticky or not too thin for my skin.
it is too heavy for me as a day time serum
it did not worsen or help the oily spots of my face
nothing seems to work other than super oily things
nothing worked- they either left my face too dry or completely oily
the serum does not coat your face like most do
oily in the t-zone where i'm break out prone
there is no oily residue on the skin when you wake up
i think this stuff must be made of liquified virgin angels because a
my skin isn't flaky as long as i regularly use the product which is good
it gets a little sticky on the face
oily mix skin been a mom of 3 i have stress face lets just say
pat on some avocado oil let me tell you my skin has been looking so moisturize
leaves it soft all day long
in the winter it gets really dry
it is not drying either!
doesn't dry your skin
i love that it's neither oily or drying
its not greasy or heavy.
soft smooth etc etc i definitely will be buying along with the moisturizer
it is not oily at all
very gentle yet so fabulous at getting rid of the flakes
it also does not irritate or dry out your skin
you need that so called 'extra step' to ensure your skin is cleansed
yet doesn't make other parts of my skin oily/break out
sparse enough to do the exfoliating without feeling like i'm scraping my skin off
the plus is it doesn't dry out my face
doesn't make me extra greasy or dry
use about the amount of a small grape all around your skin
be gentle when using this stuff.
its not too harsh
it is not overly drying
no break outs or greasy mess like i've experienced before
i no longer have a flaky look to my face.
you shouldn't have any issues with it drying out your face
which is great because it doesn't dry out my skin
i specifically asked for an exfoliator that would not irritate my fair
this scrub is one of the best out there.
it feels like a normal scrub but!!
if you add a little water to your h
with going through chemo, my face got really dry.
it did not make my sometimes-oily
it is not drying or irritating like other exfoliators i have used in the past
if you scrub even just gently you will still feel very clean
it can be a tad drying
sometimes it can make the skin around my nose
it didn't leave me oily or dry
gentle enough to use every day
not too dry or oily – just perfect
t leaves my face feeling soft without being too much of a scrub for daily use
it does not irritate your skin
as a scrub i like things to be more abrasive
it does not exfoliate as much as i would like
this product doesn't dry it out
i feel this face cleanser is just scrubby enough to keep my skin looking fresh w/o being over drying
it is low foaming but does break down the oil.
doesn't leave my skin tight or dry afterwards
shouldn't really be exfoliated much at all
it is gentle enough to use everyday
it doesn't dry me out
it doesn't irritate my skin like other scrubs have in the past
i also find that it's not too harsh or drying for my sensitive skin
honestly unless i actively put my nose to the face wash the smell isn't really too noticeable
red, itchy, dry but oily all at the same time.
i couldn't even put water in my face as my skin didn't react well to it
i could actually use it more often because it is a gentle cleanser
there it was a refresh brighter clean face it only took a tiny amount to wash my face i am very happy to purchase this product
you need to rub lightly
didn't want to end up with dry
they just freel great on your skin
had neither my staple clarasonic nor any or my every night cleanser
it was like a spell had been cast on my skin my this cleanser
i really didn't think i had puffy eyes or circles until i used this gel
i wonder if it will give enough moisture in the winter months
if it doesn't i'll likely look into a cream formula from clarins
it doesn't leave a sticky after feel
i think it works best layered under another creamier formula which would then cover your fine lines
do like the cold gel formula as well.
when i feel dry
this little tube of gel helps make them less visible if you give it half an hour to work it's magic
you can't expect an eye gel to completely diminish your bags
feel cool after using it
no cream is going to be able to penetrate below the skin to where the blood is pooling
no cream will lighten them suckers up
it doesn't leave my eyelid area sticky or make my eyes water
wasn't heavy enough to become my only eye cream
does not sting or burn my sensitive eyes
when i use this you can literally see the skin lifting up to minimize them
which is nothing short of a miracle because i normally have awful bags under my eyes
its not too heavy or to light.
have combination/oily skin with fine lines just starting
it's not so thin that it seems to dry up in 5 minutes
it didn't feel most riding or cooling
please don't stop making it bare minerals
it doesn't leave a greasy mess that would ruin your makeup
typically i will lose sleep
it does not itch or burn and goes in right away.
this is one of the first eye creams i've used that doesn't make my eyes water
i don't like using a primer in my summer routine
i can literally feel it pumping up my crows feet
i think i need it because my skin just soaks it up
not sticky or greasy
although it is supposed to be "airless"
i sometimes add a bit on crowfeet area after i've finished all my makeup to give a bit of a dewy look
it did not irritate them nearly as bad as other eye creams i have tried
goes on smoothly,not greasy & it doesn't burn.
doesn't leave any residue
every time i use this balm i always get compliments on my skin
if you struggle with makeup settling into your fine lines then this is the primer for you
i wanted to make it work so badly because i wanted that dewy glow
even though i normally have oily skin
sure it can get a bit more shiny on my nose
t's still moist when you go in with foundation
you can mix a bit of flash balm on the back of your h
i often have trouble with primers because i feel like they are so oily that my foundation will slide right off
i don't know if it like nourishes
which is very dry
it gets extremely dry in winter with dry patches
it looks super greasy after applying both
not greasy at all
for someone like me who has normal skin
dry in the winter
if your skin is typically dry
or if you forgot to moisturize before going to bed the night before this product undoes all of that
except perhaps oily skin
i find it feels cooling
it really does tighten the skin.
my skin has been so dry i can barely put make up on
find it better for the summertime
you're also supposed to apply your foundation quite quickly after applying the balm
no problems using it on my sometimes dry
it's like it changes your tone before your eyes
let it set into the skin to prevent the "pilling" issue others have described
my skin breaks out with all products except this one
definitely must pat it on, rather than rub.
i get compliments all the time on my skin.
my skin was left drier than before
my skin gets really dry in the winter
am afraid i can't use it in the summer since my skin gets oily in the summer
i do as they recommend -- squeeze a small amount on your fingers
s to get it warm
if i decide to skip my liquid foundation
just go with a powder this definitely keeps my powder makeup looking fresher longer
it does a great job at helping foundations be less cakey
it also did not cause me to break out like some moisturizing products
i find it works best to warm up in your h
i dont like primers as they roll off my skin or make me look oily
it does not feel sticky or oily
does not make your skin oily
now that we are into colder weather
better used as an emergency product if you're feeling tired or washed out
this might be great for winter when my skin gets really dry
then pat on top of your makeup to give yourself a little boost
this would be perfect when you have fatigue skin
this is my go-to product for winter when cold air
make sure to just pat into skin, don't rub.
it is not greasy
it doesn't have a lot of bad chemical stuff in it
this is meant to be used when your face/makeup seems to feel icky
it takes away that powdery dry stressed look out of your face
never gets that "greasy" feel like some other moisturizers i've used
be careful applying it though: do not rub it in
don't touch your makeup because it will become clumpy
however caution…don't use a lot of this as it can have a peeling effect on your skin
your skin can start to look shiny half way through the day
not too heavy but just right for a creamy finish.
it does make my already oily skin a little too oily
it has made my winter skin feel like its just had a drink of water
it may burn a bit
since my regular skin care routine doesn't have a mask
apply make up while the flash balm is still wet on your skin
very often i simply add some blush the the balm
then i take just a dab of this stuff -- a dize-sized amount or less -- warm it up between my palms
while i have dry skin
i never had oily skin
making it so my foundation stays longer on my skin
can dry out skin if used twice a day as recommended on packaging
because it dried my skin out so much it did cause me to break out
it might be over drying for someone with dry skin
burns if you get any close to your eyes.
t pores no more is the best for my dry/slightly combination skin
this is the only thing that really keeps hormonal break outs at bay
it's not drying either.
my face is less oily throughout the day
either way it keeps my skin unoily until the next cleansing
doesn't totally get rid of oil, but reduces it.
can make skin dry if you don't have a good face lotion
otherwise, a must have for oily skin people!
it probably would be rough on combitation skins.
i wouldn't recommend using this if you have sensitive or somewhat dry skin as it is a bit drying
it does not make my face greasy.
haven't had any drying
it also keeps my oiliness under control for the whole day
if i use it too often it dries out my skin
have not ha any problems with drying.
doesn't over dry and a little goes a long way.
does sting a bit if it gets in your eyes.
this product does a really great job at cleaning up my pores
this does a great job of cleansing my skin without irritating it
for me with fairly oily skin this just wasn't doing enough
i couldn't tell if i'd rinsed all of it off
i wash my eyes out after i use it just to be sure
just be careful not to get this in your eye it will burn your eyes like acid
it totally washed all my make-up away with no greasy residue
t won't dry my skin out
it does sting my face when i'm washing
i only use it once a day since it dries out my skin
if my skin is extra dry i put on some argan oil right after i wash my face
you should not cleanse your eyes with it in the first place
just be careful not to get the product in your eyes because it will sting
i would say that i have combination skin that gets oily throughout the day
since using this cleanser i have noticed that i get a lot less oily
i can't even open my eyes when i'm washing my face when i use it
it has been very difficult for me to find a cleanser that wouldn't irritate my skin
so this is mild enough that my face wont turn red when washing w/ it
not necessarily dried out
doesn't dry out my skin
worth every penny if you have oily skin!
mild- doesn't dry out my skin
doesn't leave my skin dry or oily
either way my face is not greasy in the morning
i also like the way it actually lathers up
especially if you use it in the shower
when it does, it stings.
so they clog up really easily
it's always hard to tell what causes what with skincare stuff especially when you have weather/diet/other product variables
two to three squirts is all you need to get the job done
it didn't leave behind a residue nor did it dry out my skin
my face doesn't feel oily after using it
i leave it on my oily spots for few seconds not dry areas
it made my dry areas really dry
the products are great to clear your face without stripping away anything so no dryness
i also really like that it only takes two small pumps to create enough lather to wash your entire face
does leave the skin a bit dry
one star taken off because you need to be really careful if washing near your eyes because it burns
it gives just the right amount of moisture without leaving skin looking greasy
this is perfect for people with dry skin.
because it can get a bit greasy
it is not greasy or heavy
effective enough for my dry spots
i can tell you you will get your most effective results with applying this pores no more cream with "patting" motions
slabbing it on is only going to rub it mostly off
great for those like me who have oily congested skin
only apply at night because it is really oily
not too heavy, not too light
although i don't think it helped with the shrinkage of my pores
i've used everything to try to clear my combination skin
not only does it moisturize well without being too heavy
it really works because it controls oil on my face so well that my face is clean
not only do my pores appear much smaller
it helps keep my t zone oil free all day long
a skincare pro at sephora recomended that i use this since i have a huge problem with my pores being so large an having really oily skin
it is the only product i have found that ends the winter dryness while not clogging my pores
yet non oily moisterizer that feels great when you put it on after using the pores no more vaccuum cleaner
leave your skin will neverbetter i lovet
feels dry after application, not greasy at all.
the only complaint is that it is a bit drying
my face isn't oily even though i am now using two skin creams
i get compliments on my skin all the time.
whenever my skin acts up or a make up wipe is too harsh on my skin
for anyone out there who has oily
the creams in that line stil made my skin break out a bit
now does the good doctor have anything to shrink fat from my body?
especially if you also use murad's acne body wash on it in the shower beforeh
t is difficult to find products that don't irritate my skin
i burn easily when in the sun
it is greasy going on, but dries quickly.
it's thick without being to oily.
keeps my skin smooth all day and not oily at all!
instant gratification after washing off as you actually can feel the pores tightening
really does help make your pores appear smaller
keeps you from getting oily throughout the day
it doesnt leave my skin tight or dry either
i burn very easily.
usually i have very oily skin by mid day
plus it helps oily skin so much.
i notice that my face isn't oily
my skin looks so healthy i sometimes go without my st
even tho i'm peeling now i feel like my skin healed ten times faster than it would with just aloe
it doesn't seem to help tone down the sunburn as much as aloe does
my face feels like there's ice on it
when i got a freaky deaky burn right after that
when you get out of the shower
was not sticky at all
put this on as soon as you get out of the sun if you think you've burned
keep it up so the burn doesn't dry out.
this always prevents peeling if i've stayed out too long
the cooling effect is even better if you stick it in the fridge prior to applying it
it leaves my skin feling like if i just put some ice there
i can feel it cooling my skin off
this product makes my sin feel refreshed after a long day at the beach or even just a hot
i love the tingling that happens when it is on burnt skin
then apply this gel whichever parts that sun spotted me
i applied it on my burn
it did not feel greasy
thought i did not like the texture of the gel at first
when you store it in the fridge it really cools you down upon application
it does wash off immediately with water.
it does not work well for me unless my skin has had sun exposure
in the summer it makes a tan last so much longer if used daily
i don't typically get burned in the summer
whether you have a sunburn or just had a little too much sun this product will soothe
make sure to do you own test patch because it tingles
if my sister who is outside a lot gets sunburn again
when ever i see that i am a little bit pink from being in the sun i use this
if you keep it in the fridge is is extra refreshing when you put it on your skin
this mask is must have for people who have warm/hot temperature face
it's important to provide cooling for the skin after being exposed to the sun
burn easily no matter how much spf i wear
i only had to use it twice on my sun burn
i will swear by this product for sun burns forever
this is the fourth year that i've used korres yogurt cooling gel on the inevitable burn i get every summer
doesn't leave a tight layer as say
especially if your tired of the aloe stick.
i especially appreciate it during the cold
not only does this cooling gel feel amazing after a day in the sun
come home with a tan that did not peel days later
once you put it on to your burned skin
burn easily so when i do burn i turn to this lotion
makes the burn hurt less somehow
burn sooooo easily in the sun
usually, it would have peeled, no question.
perfect for summer when a thicker cream may be a bit too much
it really did heal the burn i had on my shoulders really quickly
not only did it sooth my skin
we keep it in the fridge
if i've been by the pool for too long i will get an uncomfortable sunburn
this was one of those sunburns that makes you whimper at the idea of a shower touching your skin
the packaging says you can refrigerate it if you need the extra punch
it's a must after a little to much sun
i did have some peeling
the girl said i could put this in the refrigerator to help make it extra cool
thinking a few minutes longer in the tanning bed wouldn't get me burnt
this product really helped when i got sunburned really badly while swimming a 15k
it is a little sticky after i put it on
silly me wanting to get tanned so only used a spf 15 on my face
after using my toner my face can get a little red so this works great
even though it says it is for sun exposure
since i have an oily skin this gel works pefect for me
i guess some water got on my face
just don't wet your skin while its on
keep it in the frig for extra cooling comfort.
non-oily soothing cream if you have been out in the sun a bit too long
i love how it feels on skin after too much sun
even when you're vigilant about the sun
this stuff helps you weather through the dry patches by cooling
sometimes miss a few spots when applying sunscreen while at the beach
it helps your burn turn into a tan much faster
was out for something new that wasn't an aloe gel since my skin never absorbs that stuff
i tried it in the fridge to make it even colder
we've used it on burns
i like the gel form because it's not greasy
i found it to be a lot more effective then aloe alone
i find that my skin gets dry
it took so much heat out of the burn
even if you aren't sunburned
it's never made me oily or broken me out
doesn't make my face breakout or feel oily
as a very fair person who gets red if i'm in direct sunlight for more than 20 minutes
even if your not using it on sun-stressed skin
i don't use this as an after sun treatment
i didn't even apply the gel a second time
i will try it for other skin irritation too
don't put it on if you have a chill you will just get colder
because you only need a drop to soothe your whole face
in my early 40's with oily
most moisturizers make my face feel like it's on fire or cause me to break out
it is super rich but it is not oily at all.
it got rid of my dry patches.
this product is a lifesaver for my crazy dry skin in the winter
i don't wake up with crazy oily looking skin
it also does not cause me to break out even though i have super acne prone skin
something without a lot of chemicals
this cold weather was really drying out my skin
this now a staple for my winter skin care.
foundation my dry skin can be seen
i live in the high desert of oregon which means that it is always dry
doesn't feel sticky or oily either
this does not irritate my skin
it did not burn as other creams have in the past
this cream is light doesn't cause no break outs
this cream does not just sit on my skin it actually hydrates
my skin is so soft like it had a drink of water
but you do want to gently cleanse in the morning.
this is a fantastic night time moisturizer for someone like me whose skin has become dry over time
which this cream had not promised: my pores are gone
it doesn't look or feel greasy all day long
no matter how much product i slathered on my face
how it is not greasy on my face
really good base for the foundation since it didn't show my flaky skin during the winter
i need something to keep my skin from getting dry
i also need something i can put on in the morning that will work instantly to keep my skin from flaking when i apply my makeup
it is not too greasy on me
i could see it being greasy in a humid summer climate
it really saved my skin from the dry cold weather
very good for dry cold winters
i would mix oil along if i need extra moisture
i fully recommend it to anyone with dry skin.
this is the only thing that would moisturize me enough to not be flakey
it is perfect for windy winter weather because it offers a nice barrier for the skin
rich when you put it on
it does not sit oily on the skin though
great for winter time for dry skin.
which is amazing if you get dry h
i guess you could also use it on your parched visage if you have some sort of charmed face that never gets acne
it is not greasy
this is the only one that has kept my skin flake free all day
decided it would probably be better for my mom who has drier skin
yet, it did not feel heavy or sticky.
this is the only product i have tried that kept my skin flake free
really awesome for my winter dry patches
although the cream feels a little bit sticky on your h
i hate creams that have a sticky or tacky feeling on the face
highly recommend if you have dry to very dry skin
it is a very dry extreme climate especially during the winter months
it doesn't leave that sticky product feel on your face like some do
you only need to use a tiny bit
it dries fast so you don't have to wait to put your makeup on
when i get dry
i would only recommend this product for normal to dry skin
i did notice that it burns slightly when applying it
used for dry winter skin on my face
i get super dry skin in the winter
i wouldnt wear it in the day time under make up because it looks too shinny on my face
my face is sometimes so dry that the skin starts to flake
it does absorb well
my pores are much more visible even though i use good primer
it was just a tad much for my oily t-zone area
still rich enough to make an impact with dry skin
it doesn't irritate my skin at all
i would recommend this to anyone with dry skin.
he gets really dry skin in the winter
have a difficult time finding lotions that are thick enough to actually do something without being too heavy on my skin
doesn't make your face feel greasy at all
it was perfect battling the dry skin that usually comes in the winter
especially for people with dry/combo skin
in winter my skin gets dry
i am trying this because it is that time of year where all moisture in my skin seems to disappear
not heavy, not greasy,feels good.
i recommend trying if you have very dry skin in the winter
my face is a little oily at times
i wanted a cream that would help replenish moisture
dry anymore when i go to sleep
it has 24 hour moisturing properties without feeling greasy
it helps me to get rid of my tiny blemishes in t-zone
i've tried everything to get my dry skin under control
while rich it didn't leave me too greasy or make me break out
tried it when i ran out of lotion for my overly dry face
it would have felt great if my skin was dry
it is a little heavy, but not too heavy.
i do not have oily skin not sure this would work for oily skin
really great for dry skin without being too greasy
this moisturizer doesnt sit on top of your skin- unless you put too much
i buy this product every winter to keep my face felling dewy
i've never been a person who had dry skin on my face
it was really dry from the changing weather.
s are always dry because of the cold weather
they have a tendency to break out his skin
it's not greasy and can be applied often.
it cured his dry skin on his body in a short amount of time despite that he didnt use it for very long
over again if it wernt for the soy
not oily at all
the weather here is so extremely dry
it really does have a cooling sensation
not greasy at all.
his skin isn't used to the abuse it gets outside
since we bought this lotion he is itching a lot less
to take better care of his dry skin
the formula is not greasy
he says its not greasy
it's scented enough that he doesn't really need to wear a cologne if he applies this over his whole body
i've found i only notice the cooling if i put it on while my skin is still damp right after a shower
keeps me from getting dry patches
i could never get him to use lotion before
he usually gets too hot in the summer to use lotions
for many years i've never used any moisturizer since it only makes my skin more oily
first time i applied it i knew my skin will most likely be even more oily since the moisturizer is thick
i tend to have oily skin
since i've started using this i haven't had dry flaky skin
now i'm even more happy when i use essential c night moisture
love this product during the winter time when my skin is really dry
not greasy oil free
really get to work on my dry skin
everything left my skin too oily
i did notice that it makes a skin a little drier than normal after washing it off
most things either overdry my skin or make the breakouts worse
i love it during winter where im a little drier
when youre at the end of the tube its very hard to get all of it out
mixes well with other face lotionsi usually put jojoba oil ontop if i want a super dewy facecons: sometimes can wear off around super dry areas if you arent using a toner its very expensive
don't use this if you have oily skin
use this if you have dry or normal skin
this does not irritate my skin
just make sure you wait about 5 minutes for it to soak in before applying makeup
the only reason for 4 stars is because it can get a bit greasy if over applied
honestly since this product is so rich i only use about 2 pea sized dots on my entire face to moisturizer
spf that did not irritate my dry
i never knew that a moisturize can do this much for my skin
you have to rub it in quite a bit
it dried up my skin sooooo badly
it really helped my dryness make a quick recovery
when i first used it i didn't have a dryness problem
it doesn't break out my sensitive skin
i can tell it will be moisturizing enough for winter time too
if your skin tends to be on the dry skin this probably isn't the face lotion for you
doesn't leave the skin greasy
to let it really soak in
i love this because it really helped my overly stressed skin after exposure to the sun this summer
not oily or greasy feeling at all!
my #1 problem has always been that sunscreen tends to make me break out
i never burn with this on.
it may feel slightly oily when you first put it on
as it was getting warmer
so many that i tried felt really heavy or greasy or just weird on my skin
i would definitely say that this absorbs quickly into the skin
so oily skin might not like?
it seems thick at first when applying
your skin will soak it up in a few minutes
it gives me the sun protection i need without the breakout
if your skin is fickle it might not provide enough moisture in the freezing winter
too much in the humid summer
this one doesn't break me out at all---i put on a thin layer
now have dry skin
y now especially since i like in a drier climate- it moisturizes
doesn't run if i sweat
doesn't cause my skin to break out or become oily
it is light enough to wear alone before exercising or going out casually
love it for oily or dry skin.
it does occasionally make me a little shiny.
it does not feel greasy after its in
i think for someone with oily skin who does not need much moisture
most are oily when on face, but this isn't.
even i i don't put makeup over it i don't look like a total grease ball
it has been tough to find a moisturizer with spf that doesn't make my skin feel greasy throughout the day
it can separate in the tube a bit
have't been regularly using a daily moisture treatment you'll see the change within days
it's non-greasy & feels light on your face.
use only a little bit otherwise it doesn't absorb well
although i can sometimes be left kind of dried out using it with the clarisonic
i wouldn't recommend it for dryer skin or winter months because it does lather a fair amount
doesn't dry my face at all
wish it was foaming though.
if you're blemish prone you need to be using the blue formula
you need only a tiny amount to clean your whole face
plus it didn't dry out my skin!
the more you add water the more it foams which is really interesting
not dry or tight
it doesn't feel over dried
my skin didn't feel as clean or as smooth
it became oily again too
i started to get acne again because i wasn't really getting a true deep cleanse
i truly do like this cleanser it just does not suffice for my acne-prone skin
gentle cleanser even though the tube is huge-it lasts forever
especially if you have dry skin
dry after i wash my face
this face wash does not give me that discomfort
my oily t- zone is a thing of the past
definitely helps with breakouts i sometimes get from make up
now i don't find it to be super foamy
even some eye make-up remover bothers me
it didn't strip my dry skin too much
definitely not a daily wash
if used more then every other day it dries your skin out too much
it is not harsh or over drying
less bead'y things in the cleanser that use to feel like they scrubbed you
the oil-control mattifier spf 15 during the day well my face is looking great
i don't have oily skin at all anymore.
it is not oily or too harsh.
does not feel too dry when finished
you can feel the little beads working
does not dry my aging skin.
that product is amazing your skin stay clean all day :
too-you won't see any smudges of make up on the towel after drying your face
not dry or too tight
u only need very little to cleanse
cleans off everything but does not dry out skin.
if you use it regularly it will brighten your skin immensely
this is a good product that doesn't leave any filmy residue
it doesn't dry out your skin
although it dries my skin out a little bit
it never dries my skin out no matter how much product i dispense
i think only the juice beauty has left my skin like this
this cleanser makes my skin feel energized so that's why i like to use it in the mornings
does a great job of cleansing without leaving any residue behind
fresh- not stripped or dry
make it completely dry
like this for daily cleansing -doesn't dry your skin out
it does not dry out the skin.
it does not foam up
getting kind of sick of it.
make sure to wear an spf besides to protect from sun damage on my sensitive skin
he did think the price was a little steep for lotion
the combination of the 2 made my skin much drier
which didn't do much for my skin other than hydrate it
i did not find the lotion texture to be too thick or heavy for my skin
this product is not oily
it's the only thing that has been able to make my skin as soft as a baby's
is not greasy at all
i can imagine it being fine for really oily skin during the daytime or if you want to layer it under a sunscreen
my skin gets super dry in the winter
i can't remember the last time i had a pimple or overly dry or oily patches
that was a bit drying
he said that it would just "soak into my skin
just a dab is enough for your whole face
i highly recommend to anyone that wants a non greasy face cream
the only drawback is that the cream can cause flaking one apply under make-up
great for even oily skin like mine.
i would prefer it in a bottle instead of a jar
it is not greasy or heavy.
as with any skin care product it doesn't work overnight
the balm can go all over your eyes
does not feel at all oily as it sinks into your skin
this does not sting or burn
even my eyelids get extremely oily so creams don't work well for me at all because they tend to to look super oily after application
that's another thing-- you can use this balm on your entire eye area including your upper eye area
what the sales lady didn't tell me was how large the jar was compared to other eye creams
it feels great -- not too thick or greasy.
i like how it keeps the skin below my soft
i love this mask it really helps after being at the lake or pool all day
i started using this product this fall/winter when my eyes got so dry the skin around them was getting scaly
does not sting or make your eyes water.
i've looked for a product that you can use on your eyelids
i wish sephora would get their tease zone because it's great for oily skin
after a sephora rep told me they no longer carry ddf nourishing eye cream
i don't like most creams because they leave my face a grease slick which makes me look shiny
i'll have to try the actual cream for the face because if it's anything like this eye balm
i do think the tissues around my eyes are not as slouchy as before
i also like that it does not leave a greasy residue
makes my mascara bleed out too much under the eye during the day
i went into sephora looking an eye cream that was overly heavy or oily
it is too drying in winter
the skin around my eyes can get dry
have really had a hard time finding an eye cream that's hydrating enough
which was too sticky
when i do wear concealer it doesn't look powdery because my skin beneath it is in much better condition
i love you can also use it on your upper lid
even with oily skin, my undereyes are dry.
he has more experience with eye creams then i do
need to go to that place that mediocre eye creams go to
so since it has retinol make sure you don't get it too close to the eye
also, it is not too thick.
i clean out the spout as best as i can
it does make my eyes water if it gets in them
i needed a new cream becuase i was getting really bad under eye circles
my eye area gets extremely dry in the winter months forcing me to switch creams
this eye cream does everything it claims.
it is not greasy
perfect under make-up even for oily skin
does not burn your eyes.
it is not too heavy so my make up looks cakey.
he says it doesn't make him feel more oily compared to other face lotions he has used in the past
only downside is the slight sting if you've just scrubbed your face
seems to lock in moisture pretty well
it doesn't feel like moisturizer when you touch it after it sets
true to the name it does not leave my skin feeling oily or greasy
most moisturizers make me feel so greasy in the t zone area
doesn't make my skin feel heavy or greasy
works when my skin is feeling just a little drier than usual
the cream he had before was very thick- paste like
my face isn't as oily as it use to be in the morning
the rest of his face can get quite oily
does not add oil to an already oily complexion.
anthony logistics' oil free facial lotion is perfect for the guy whose face is dried out by physical activity
it is unlikely to leave your skin shiny or greasy
it seems to really moisturize without getting greasy or oily
not greasy at all.
this will not leave your face greasy
this unfortunately left me with dry flaky patches all over my face
and not the usual greasy normal.
i will use it after every peel.
definitely not until at least after 7 to 10 days after a heavy peel just because you want to try to avoid exfoliation after
keep it in your fridge for extra cooling!
usually i feel like i need to wash my mask afterwards if it's too creamy
even though it's an exfoliating mask it doesn't leave me feeling dry
tend to get oily in my t-zone
this mask takes such great care of my sensitive areas i just can't see my mask routine without it
depends on how dry your skin is
this mask doesn't irritate my skin at all
it has helped my dry skin so much!
it should not sink into the skin
in the winter i get horrible dry patches
dry patches stand no chance with this mask!
this is the mask for you
not drying as this can easily be fixed with a moisturizer after
it didn't sting, or burn or feel uncomfortable.
t takes a bit of time to wash off
this is a must-have, especially for dry skin.
it never dries but stays tacky.
i actually like that it never dries down as it keeps a hydrating effect on my skin
the gel is a little hard to get off
this is the first enzyme mask i have used which did not sting or burn
every time i use this mask it not only helps with the dead skin
i usually need a towel to help me wipe it off
or else i'm left with some residue
it takes a lot of rinsing to get it all off
like a gel because it doesn't make my skin feel tight or look like i have a mask on
this relatively inexpensive mask is a great little treatment for dry winter skin or skin that just needs a little boost
as soon as i washed it off my mom said my skin look significantly brighter
this does not sting or make my face red
anyone with sensitive-normal skin needs to add this to their skin care routine
i always feel like it takes off just dead skin that is clogging my pores
it hydrates your skin very well without making it oily the next day
soft skin immediately after you wash it off
i feel like my face had a big drink of water.
what you see is what you get with these jars--no cutting open dispensers for last drops
my nose would peel alot, now nothing.
i love to use this instead of more drying masks.
it was coming back so often that i couldn't keep exfoliating
it doesn't burn or tingle or anything
wanted the all night results without any irritation or dryness--using this in the morning helped completely
sometimes i don't want to wash it off because it smells so good
i can leave this on for 4 or more hours with it irritating my skin
though does not make my skin more oily than it already is
i originally bought this mask because i had issues with slightly oily skin that tends to be dry in places
i guess it depends on your sensitivity or if you scrub it off
it comes off easily if you just splash it with water
you do have to splash water for about a minute since it is pretty sticky
i keep mine in the refrigerator to keep it nice
when you apply it it really wakes up your skin...
just wash off with cold water
when it's time to wash it off you can see that most of the mask is gone
my face is dry
thick because your skin will soak up a lot of it
if i use this mask i don't have an issue with dry skin
my only complaint is that the mask needs to sit on your skin for 20 minutes
or get in the shower
relax when my skin is being de-stressed by this mask
once i wash it off
whereas those other peels i can only use once a week if i want my face to keep from peeling
i also love how it's free from nasty chemicals.
this product along with most other ole products did not irritate my skin
it is a little sticky but comes off clean.
really dry in the winter
this still doesn't leave me greasy
i live in a climate that is only dry in winter
my face gets extremely dry in certain places
because my skin was neither dry or oily
although i am oily
they all made my skin burn
although they didn't make my skin burn or turn red
this was the only product that was heavy enough for my dry skin
not too heavy to make my skin break out
s used to have dry wrinkles which make me look old
i definitely need extra moisture
though i don't know yet if this cream is rich enough during harsh winter in mi
my skin stays perfect thru the winter months then of course some the hot months it can be a bit heavy on the skin
does not leave a greasy feel on your skin
it absorbs well enough after a shower to use for day
not break out my sensitve skin
all the great ingredients that you want for your skin without the oils
if you skin is dry or combination
don't have that product laying on top of oily skin problem
when i put it on the thick texture makes me feel like i'm putting on a spa mask
love using this cream in the dead of winter when my skin is dry
my face does not have that crepe paper feel
i felt like my skin could not breath
it does work as far as plumping the skin
the few that i have now are more like the ones you get after a facial when the "junk" is cleaned out of your skin
as it turns out i wasn't properly moisturizing my under eye very well
it really is a good cream if your eyes are dry or you have dry patches
i can never find an eye cream that really plumps up the lines as well
make sure with any eye cream that you do not apply it all the way up to the lower lash line or super close to the eye it should only be applied to the orbital bone area
when you put them super close to your eye or lash line it has no where else to travel
not too greasy/oily, either.
my undereye was in desperate need of moisture
not greasy at all
doesn't have any scent or irritate my eyes
not so oily that they slip off
i imagine this eye cream will be hard to beat
that it could be thicker
this cream actually gets rid of fine lines.
purchased this because i could not get enough moisture in the under-eye area from other well know eye creams
it is not greasy
it only takes a small amount to keep your eye area moisturized all day or all night
and it doesn't burn my eyes.
it does sting a bit if i get it too close to the lash line
never feels heavy or greasy
as your natural body heat will cause the product to travel naturally to this area
almost everything i have ever tried irritates my skin
it does make my eyes water once in awhile
it doesn't feel heavy or greasy plus i think it is brightening up my under-eye area
on hot days it does make my skin feel a little greasy
just a dab is all you need.
really like knowing that i'm doing all i can for the thinnest skin on my body
perfect if you are sensitive in the area near your eyes
i also mix a little bit on the creme with my concealor when i apply it
probably from the lack of humidity
neeed intense moisture to last thru the night this is very rich feeling
extra rich eye cream that's good for nightime use
this is a very thick cream that stays where you put it
soaks right in without leaving a film or build-up like some eye creams that ball up when you try to put makeup over them
great at adding moisture without being heavy.
i also like that you get more product than the traditional container of eye cream
is not greasy or thick
now i can actually see my lower lids
easy to blend in without having to pull or rub hard to get it to absorb
which is great in cold weather
it does leave a somewhat sticky residue on the skin
needed something more for extremely dry colorado winters
not greasy to the touch afterward
without making you look oily
a little goes a long way if you have oily/combo skin
creamy consistencies because at night i want something that will melt into my skin
doesn't burn or sting
i felt like it dried out my skin
it can be a bit sticky while it's absorbing
often i find myself constantly putting lotion on my face or seeing my make up dry out my skin even more
get really dry skin in the winter
doesn't leave a greasy heavy feeling like some creams do
gives me minimum shine while keeping my oily
my mom picked this up for me a few days ago after she asked a sephora employee what products would be best for acne prone skin that gets rather dry in the winter
when used as a night cream it does wonders to my oily
the only thing is that it can make your skin a bit oily
it gets dry here
it will start to feel sticky
can rub off in little chunks when you use your fingers to apply makeup
doesn't leave me greasy!
its so hard for me to find good day creams that don't make me oily
the only reason is didn't get 5 stars is because it is slightly runny compared to other moisturizers
the skim milk if you will.
my skin can get into really bad dry patches
they are the only heavy-duty moisturizers i have found that actually clear up my complexion instead of blocking pores
ts more tolerable than a oil based one for anyone who doesn't like the feel of thick lotions
i can't find another cream that is as light
some areas would get really oily
some were way too oily for the rest of my face
it really does wonder especially for the dry areas
it does not leave a greasy texture
my skin was in desperate need of moisture
i used it after getting a little sun burn
it may feel a little bit oily when first applied
not oily at all
my face never appears dry.
i only use it as a day cream- i find i need something a bit heavier at night
not overpowering in any way
my skin doesn't feel greasy after i use it
perfect for those months when you need a little extra moisture
i wouldn't recommend it for the warmer months though
my skin isn't oily at all when using this product
i would recommend this to anyone who has oily skin
i dry out a lot in the winter
dry skin before applying on make-up
sometimes when i use the pomegranate i end up using too much product because it is so light
i feel as though applying it before makeup in the morning would be too greasy
i feel like if i use it too much my skin gets super oily
i like using this moisturizer in the winter because it really really works well with the cold weather as well as dry skin
sometimes my face still feels dry even after using it
i wanted to make sure my skin wasn't suffering too much from the dry air on board the plane
it's not visible on your skin
sometimes i find myself just leaving it on for most of the day because it's so soothing
very dry or very oily
i feel like it kind of "layers" on top of my face
then if i "rub" my face it would come off like a "peel-mask"
tends to get very dry in areas in the winter
i get fairly dry skin in the cold weather
i find the korres greek yogurt cream to be extremely great for my skin in the cold dry weather
you do have to rub it in a bit
i don't find it oily
i did wake up with fairly smooth skin
the one major con is that as the weather has been getting dryer i've noticed i need a little more moisture
if you keep it in your bag for touchups you look amazing all day
using hope in a tube has made me forget my skin was ever that dry
doesn't leave you with that "gunky"
if i ever get any dry areas on my skin i just dab a bit of this product on the area
dry skin no more
i don't feel like getting botox or fillers anytime soon
that may only apply to people who have darker skin tones as i'm about as pale as you can get
cannot be sure if it's from the cream or massaging it in
would recommend this to all skin types except maybe those with very oily eyelids who need that controlled
some of them provide no moisture whatsoever
like how it goes on- start out thick/creamy
i never get that itchy burning feeling when you get a little too close to the lash line
does not pull or tug on your delicate skin area.
not as absorbent as i would want it to be however it does help diminish fine lines around the eyes
it's also nice to use the extra to pat onto your lips
it's been particularly cold and dry this winter.
lips when you have a cold
when i do it really helps smooth out the lips
this cream solved that problem without being greasy
it is very thick, so you have to pat it on.
great for cold weather
this cream really helped to get rid of them
i never thought i would be able to use moisturizer let alone eye cream as my skin is quite oily i can use this with oil-free hope in a jar
once you rub it n it does get watery
you can't just smooth it over the eye
if you try to just smear it over your eye/lip area
you'll end up pulling that delicate skin
like you should do around the delicate eye area
find it too heavy for daytime with my oily skin
my eys never look dry or parched.
it is the only one that i have found that really hydrates under my eyes
gets rid of the crepey dry look
under my eyes was getting very papery so the light cream i was using just wasn't working anymore
this the best eye cream-does not dry up during the day
my face fells hydrate through or the day like you feel a layer of cream on your face
you can feel the moisture if i make sense
a lighter night cream dependent upon how dry my skin is
only use this at night because it makes my face too oily when i use under my makeup in the daytime
it really does give you just the right amount of moisture
the soap dish it comes with will help keep it from drying out
it's dry by the time i'm done
either version for people with dry
i actually prefer the extra mild in the winter as this can be a bit drying on the cheeks during the cold months in canada
was nervous about getting the mild soap instead of the oily one
it doesn't dry out my skin and its very nice.
i want a cleanser that really does the job without being drying
i advise you to get the mild soap unless you really do have oily skin
using warmer water makes this more drying than necessary
i will still probably switch back to a non-foaming cleanser in the fall/winter
i keep the lid on when it's in the shower
helps keep the bar from getting messy on you
for a really long time i've had an issue with my skin getting oily thru the day
doesn't leave your face dry.
i wash my face only once a day with this soap as i have really dry skin
my skin does not feel tight or drawn after washing
my cheeks don't feel dried out the way they usually do
it doesn't dry my skin out
the only downside is that it over dries in small areas of my face
it doesn't leave my skin feeling oily or dried out
my skin isn't oily or very dry.
it does not dry out my face
it also comes in a really nice case that prevents contamination or nasty soap build up
i find the new soap dish much better than the old style
doesn't dry out my face
i find this a little bit drying for an "extra mild" soap
i really like this soap/ it does not foam too much
it does not dry or irritate skin.
dirt out like no other face wash
my skin never feels dry after using it
it dried my skin out way too much
t doesn't go all over your countertop
which i liked because it kept the soap from becoming dirty
then dry his skin out
nothing works better for my oily skin
this is the very best soap you can use on your face
dry after using it
this really seemed to do the trick to help manage my extremely oily
it doesn't dry my skin out
this doesn't leave any residue or make your skin feel tight
have blown a lot of cash on cleansers that either dry my face out or leave it feeling unclean
this is a huge break-through as i had a bad case of dry patches
or just if your skin is sweaty and oily.
sensitive skin so the extra-mild soap is just right for me
it never dries me out
found that the bar for oily skin was too drying
i do get some drying
doesn't dry your skin out
you need a small amount to clean your face
it dries me out a little
it is the only product that i have found that helps controll my oily skin
don't leave it laying around in water it will "melt" fast
they always dry my skin
t's really hard to find products that work on my extremely dry skin
doesn't make my skin feel tight or dry afterward
think the bar will last much longer than the liquid face wash does
it doesn't dry out your skin
it's very foamy so you don't have to use as much as you would for liquid soap
it really really dried out my face
everything made for acne just dried me out
made my skin worse by producing excess oils as it had been stripped of them
when i use this soap it helps to make the oil less noticeable
does not dry me out
it's very gentle and not drying at all.
this regime really helps to keep my skin clear while keeping it from drying up with terrifying dry patches
i love the way that it cleans my face other then some products that i have used which left me still oily one hour after washing my face
i found this to be very good for using after washing my face
it helps keep my very oily skin under control
-- even for a man with oily skin
it works for most of the day preventing me from having shiny skin
would never use them because they would leave my skin so oily
he will resort to body lotion on his face if i don't keep this around
although that method doesn't help his skin from being flaky
his skin isn't dry anymore
not too greasy and spreads well and far.
as he has combination skin that is drier in some areas
it provides just the right amount of moisture without being too much
it doesn't really prevent dry skin
if you feel like you could use some firming for the upper eye this cream is a most buy
even though it is a thicker cream than i've used before
my skin can dry out
was needing to use a lot to get adequate moisture
also that it's not so greasy that my make-up smudges
it gives spf 30 so you're protecting your skin!
if some gets into your eye
it doesn't sting or "travel"
i get nice moisture which is a bonus
my other reason for getting this was the dryness that comes with the winter months in addition to the dryness i occasionally experience from using retin-a micro
as soon as you put this cream on the lines smooth away
it is not greasy
this works great for contact lens wearers too as it does not burn at all
have trouble finding skin care that does not irritate my skin
this product did not irritate my skin
is not easy to get out of the jar
you don't to apply too much as it is a bit dense yet that is the way firming creams are supposed to be
i do feel a little more cushion
i love it because i use it after my scrub
yes there is dirt on the cotton pad
my face is not oily anymore.
cleaned up a lot of the blackheads i tend to get in my t-zone
i recommend immediately following with moisturizer so your skin doesn't get dried out
it's even gentle enough that if he is too lazy to put lotion on after
it doesn't leave my face dry
5 will be better for guys with normal-oily skin
this product by no means ends his oily skin
it's hard to get the rest of the foam out when it gets low resulting in waste
conditions your skin all day long
ready to be washed with any other face treatments
my oily areas are really oily
i could never get used to the feeling of the thick air in
a chance if you dry them out with clinique's clarifying lotion
so happy i finally found a product that cleans my skin without over drying or irritating
though obviously it would be super expensive to use this as a brush cleanser
it didn't dry out my skin
it also doesn't feel oily
it's difficult to find a cleanser that either doesn't make it worse
the places i'm oily or have breakouts it helps to get rid pf oil
i still use this when i travel because it's hard to travel with a bar of soap
not drying or anyway damaging to skin which is the most important thing
then follow with the foam cleanser to get every little bit off
t is often hard for me to find a cleanser that doesn't give me hives or a rash
you only need a tiny bit to lather it up
never dry or tight
also doesn't dry my face out with all the chemicals
it can be drying
my skin doesn't feel dry or tight after use
you don't have to follow-up with the bar soap
it doesn't dry out my skin
always go back to clinique for my skin care
it goes on so easy and washes off well.
it does not dry it out or leave a yucky residue.
as a face wash i find this way too harsh
i don't even have sensitive or dry skin
doesn't leave my face dry or irritated
great at not drying out my skin
i find that those ingredients tend to irritate my skin
i do find that it does aggravate some dry spots
really clean my face without drying it out or feeling like it's been pull back because it's so tight
most of my make-up removers are to be used on a dry face
it isn't drying to me
clinique better keep this in the line because it is my cleanser from now on
controls my oily t-zone very well
my skin sometimes seems to break out from harsh products
the only small detail i can think of that i'd like to see improved is that this cleanser can be a bit drying
that squeeky clean drying which for me
recommended this it takes your makup off literaly in one wash
doesn't dry out my skin
highly recommend for those that want their face to feel squeaky clean after washing
i really like this scrub for my skin.
doesnt give you dry skin
it can be a bit drying
leaves my face smooth, not too oily or dry.
you have to wash your face a couple of times
they all dried out my skin
does not leave face oil or dry.
i prefer to use this in the shower because it's really foamy
tends to get everywhere otherwise
after a trial size i realized how well it lathers
it can feel a bit drying after you use it
the lather is pretty minimal
i put on a small dab of face lotion because it does make your face feel a little tight
however i don't feel it treats the skin of any blemishes or anything
a little goes a long way because of all the foam.
it gets in your eye it will sting
i make sure i follow with a good moisturizer to avoid the tight feeling
it's takes a little longer than i'd prefer to wash off
it feels like a cream which for my oily skin might not be a good idea
at first i was worried that it would dry out my skin because it was also made for very oily skin
i totally recommend this for normal to oily skin types
yet i don't suggest this for very dry skin types.
i don't need make up removers anymore except for the eye area
if my skin doesn't like something it will break out a ton of little white pimples around my mouth/chin area like when i get waxed with too hot wax
i like it because i have oily skin
this didn't irritate my skin or add to my reaction at all
it isn't drying even on sensitive skin
it was because i was dry
for someone who gets very little sleep
not dry or tough
is too thick for me
so spending $32 on a small tub of eye cream is a big deal for me
cannot use a lot of products on my eyes
doesn't feel oily or greasy afterwards
i can really lather it over my eyes without any eye irritation
soft without making it oily at all
it's not like i could just exfoliate the dry patches away being on such a delicate area
if you had dryness on your eyelids this will really help you
takes a while to absorb-do something else before applying moisturizer or foundation
this stuff does not burn my eye area at all
when i put it on in the morning i can actually see the puffiness going away
this cream feels so nice on right out of the shower
give it a try under your eyes before make up if your skin is dry
feels so cooling when applied in the am
you'll have the jar for a long time
i got it while searching for an eye cream to get rid of the dry spots
but it is very light, not sticky.
just make sure you wash your h
because of my lack of sleep
low for an eye cream that i actually would like
i can't use it on my upper lids however
oily for some reason
as my lids tend to be a bit oily just in general
as that area can sometimes be a bit dry
as my skin is getting dryer with age
i typically apply enough to make my eye area appear slightly "wet"
i gave it 4 stars because of there is no spf in the cream
make them all nasty
if your looking to get rid of dark bags
if you already have issues with exfoliating your eye areas i would definitely skip it
you skin can absorb it really quickly
it is not oily
sometimes if i am not careful applying the cream
it can make my eyes water
the solution is simple: just don't stick this cream in your eyes
normally he doesn't like to put on any lotion or cream on his face
he thinks it not greasy on his face smell is not heavy
it's not drying out his skin
my guy hates moisturizers because he doesn't like the greasy feel they have
this is the one product he has used that has good sunscreen in it that did not irritate his skin one bit every use
the barely there scent does not compete with his cologne or after shave
it still good enough to keep his skin from getting flaky
it gives just the right amount of moisture
it's also not greasy or oily
im oily skin and it works so well on me.
it does not make him oily even in hot humid mississippi summers
this one is a bit too light for winter
t seems not moisture enough to him
he is really happy with this product- it provided instant moisture to his skin
who needed a little extra moisture in the colder months
got him this hydrator
his skin gets dry throughout the day
we both have dry skin--- he used my moisturizer from clinique until he got his own
because his skin gets so dry in the winter
as a flight attendant my skin is always so dry
because his skin kept getting so dry from the cold weather
he has very dry
before you buy it just make sure you have a dry skin
no more dry skin
i just wish it had sun protection
it doesn't leave me oily or break me out.
because it definitely controls my oily face
i don't like the layering a lot of products on my skin
i break out very easily if a product is too heavy/rich
even if it is a light gel
does not make skin greasy at all
whenever i have a dry patch or anything it goes away instantly with the help of my gel
when i use moisturizers i tend to get tooo oily in the oily parts
ok in the dry parts
it helps give some added moisture in my dry spots
did amazing job on my problematic oily skin.
as i figured that if my skin got slightly oily
my skin doesn't look extra oily at the end of the day
regular skin everywhere else
doesn't leave my skin greasy at all
i've also noticed that my skin doesn't get very greasy throughout the day
it didn't cause any breakouts for me unlike the argan oil
i can touch my face
not feel anything sticky
wouldn't recommend on dry skin.
and my skin stays less oily throughout the day.
although it's drier in the winter
it is not thick or greasy whatsoever
none seem to work for my normal/oily skin
many made me too oily
can tend to get oily at some points throughout the day
i could feel both of these especially since i sleep on silk pillowcases my face would just stick
dealt with having a dry face because i preferred being dry over my face sticking to my pillow
did not stick to my pillow in the slightest bit
not oily at all
the texture of this moisturizer literally gives me a deep breath the second i put it on
nothing seemed to make my dry skin go away
it doesn't leave my skin feeling oily or shinny.
putting it on every night won't make you wake up with pimples from the oils sinking into your skin
i'd usually characterize my skin as normal or slightly dry
lately have really been struggling to keep it moisturized without resorting to a heavy
now in a very dry climate
even without makeup my skin doesn't get oily during the day anymore
would definitely recommend for dry, combo skin
it is very difficult to find when you have oily skin
mattifies is enough to make someone with oily skin in love with their skin
let me talk about my skin a little bit: i have large pores on my very oily nose
my skin just feels like it has the right amount of moisture
obviously if you have dry skin or super dry patches you'll want something more moisturizing
is just enough moisture
it's dry to the touch in a minute or less
t soft although if you have drier skin
this moisturizer does not break me out or leave me feeling oily
wouldn't make me more oily
you may need to moisturize more at night so your skin doesn't get too dry like moi
this is the only moisturizer i can use every day without breaking out into a red blotchy mess or having sore skin for the rest of the day
have found they leave a tacky
so winter is somehow a very wet cold
feels gentle yet powerful cleaning yet hard to work with in a sparing way given the watery texture
does a great job in order to hydrate your skin with fair price
i find for me it provides enough moisture that i don't have to use a separate night moisturizer anymore
30's who doesn't need a heavier cream yet
my face is really oily so this mask wasn't really for me
without making your face oily
i just want to keep rubbing my face!
my face started seriously drying out i used a very light layer of this as a moisturizer at night
has completely gotten rid of the dry flaky skin within a week
clean after use without drying me out like other masks
this mask seems to help with spotty dryness without adding any oil
not incredibly annoying to wash off like some masks can be
night so my skin is never super dry
i want to bathe in this stuff!
i just keep the product in my fridge
my face is dry- spend a lot of time in the sun.
i live in a very dry climate
so my skin is constantly dry especially in the winter
it makes me want to buy the toner from their br
you can actually see the rose petals which made me feel fancy
the sugar is fine enough to do its job
t's like a to go product if your skin is dry from the weather
i would 100% recommend this to anyone with dry/normal skin
mine is very dry
it spreads really well so you only need a finger dabs worth which is great cause it'll last pretty long depending on how often you use it
my skin was in much need of moisture
i'll often "treat" myself to this mask after an especially stressful work week
not only that it has rose petals which i think is pretty cool
usually when i travel to drier places
it really takes a toll on my skin since i live in humid weather
doesn't make your skin tight while it sits
when you wash it off
all dry skinned people need to buy this asap!
once i remove it i do not even need to moisturize
normally live in a hot humid climate
i still have product leftover
my skin is crazy dry now
i also find i need less moisturizer because my skin doesn't feel dry after using this
it didn't irritate my skin at all
i immediately saw a difference on my dry flaky patches after one use
it's not a product that does miracles to the worse of dry skin conditions
i usually use this when my skin is feeling dry
either from being winter/wind chapped or from a cosmetic product that didn't agree with my skin
it doesn't cause flare ups either which is a huge plus
i would recommend this mask to anyone with sensitive skin
i also use this on days where my skin is very dry
this is such a refreshing mask to put on your skin
i try to use a thin layer to make it last as long as possible
knowing how rosewater helps combat oil i decided to put it in my morning routine
i like it better than the murad face peel.
i get a lot of dry skin
it just felt like it locked in the moister
i always use it in the morning to prep for full coverage foundation to avoid dry patches
it looks like i take 3 years off of my face when i use it because my skin is so bright
my skin can be very oily at times
very dry at others
it fells so light on the skin that you wouldn't think it works
because of the cooling feel
like to use it when my skin is feeling dry
also a nice change up from a lot of the clay based masks i use since it's like a jelly without the sticky feeling
glowing when you wash it off
the weather is really hard on my skin
it says to wash off however i usually let it sit on my skin
i've never had a reaction or dirty pours after doing so
not too heavy or too light
i also find it sometimes makes my eyes feel a bit watery
great for dry skin, good for winter and summer.
the pump is great since i hate digging my fingers into any product
just don't apply to areas that have broken skin or areas that are dry
i would recommend this to anyone who has normal to dry skin
had a hard time finding the right mosterizer that did not leave my face extra greasy or extra dry
i switch to the cream version in the wintertime as my dry skin need a little more moisture starting in the fall
"really oily" in summer
even though my skin is super sensitive i don't find it irritating at all
wonderful sun protection without the greasy feeling some spf can have
no dry patches, even in the winter.
unfortunately the oil content makes it too heavy for summer
i like this product because i am able to wear it while exercising in the sun
heat without my face sweating too horribly
do not use it under beauty balm on made up days
this is the one lotion with high spf that i wont have bad reactions to it
not oily all day long
you can get matching eye cream too
not too greasy nor sticky
i sometimes just wear my bienfait on my clean skin
my only dislike is that my skin needs a little extra moisture during the winter months
its a bit thick so you don't need to use as much
the spf of 30 is great because i don't have to worry about forgetting the sunscreen
i never would wear tank tops because of it
it doesn't burn my eyes
its a little too light for my skin in the winter time
obviously sunscreen is so good for you too.
it does leave your skin a little shiny after you use it
perhaps a bit too much so for oily skin or in summer
does not leave white residue
don't put it on your lips
it can be hard to get rid of the taste
t's difficult for me to find a moisturizer that doesn't make my skin break out
still the perfect amount of moisture all day long
i don't have to scrub or rub anything.
his face is non greasy without the tacky left over texture
this product is not greasy
he likes it enough to keep using it if is there over regular body lotion
the lightweight texture is not something one would normally think of as a night cream
he has normal to oily skin with occasional break outs
it can sting if there is any nick in the skin.
i always have such a problem finding makeup removers that don't irritate or make my eyes burn
i can rub it directly on my eyes
it doesn't burn my eyes
now that i use this balm i just rub it all over my face
warm it all over your face
although i usually still double cleanse to fully remove the balmy residue
it doesn't make me break out or dry out my skin.
they dry me out
really helps me get makeup off which helps prevent breakouts which i'm pretty prone too
it'll be hard to match this when shopping around for a different remover
i love it for the eye area because i don't have to rub hard so there is no irritation
doesn't dry my face out
it doesn't leave any residue
needs a lil bit time to melt down which is acceptable
t was a little hard removing the oily after feel
taking it off with this balm was probably the weirdest feeling on my face like you applied a whole bottle of foundation on your face
when you actually take it off with a make up wipe it makes your face feel so hydrated
this product doesn't dry my skin out at all: instead it leaves an nice moisturized feel afterwards
does not make my combination sensitive skin break out
i do find after rinsing i still need to give my face a quick wipe to really get rid of absolutely everything
because my skin tend to get sensitive these days
doesnt like oil or greast on my face afterwards
i love that if i do swatches on my arm i don't have to scrub forever
i just recently found out about these balms that take off make-up
you get a lot in the container
it may take a minute to careful rub it in
this stuff didn't dry out my skin or leave it feeling oily
i hope clinique never stops making this balm.
i am not good at using cleaning oils-they are always in my eyes
in your eyes if you don't wash your face after using it
i don't feel like any product gets wasted like with squirt bottles or having to use a ton of cosmetic circles
when washing your eyes make sure you thoroughly rinse the product off or your eyes will seem foggy for a couple minutes
gets everything off easily without having to pull at grab at your skin especially your eye area
doesn't burn or irritate the eye area
my mascara comes off like it was barely even there
with just a little bit of this it completely dissolves the make up
definitely buy this if you wear lots of waterproof
plus it doesn't leave my skin oily or dry.
do exactly as it says on the package: rub into dry skin
you don't need a lot of this balm to remove a fully face
it doesn't dry out my skin or break me out!
usually i'm iffy about putting oils on my face
once you scoop up some product with your finger
do not use water.
do not use any water before putting this product on your face
i also love that when you go to rinse off your face with just water
wunderbrow that doesn't budge for anything melts right off
you should put it on you dry skin over your makeup with dry h
does not rip off the oils from your skin
i love the way this makes my skin feel after i rinse it off
or made me more oily
actually i fell like it adds more moisture into it
not to mention i have such sensitive skin so any products i use my face turns red
looked tired until i used murad's essential cream
it is a bit heavier than my hydrator
does not leave the skin greasy
you have to throw away small amount of it because it dries out
not only do you get sun protection
you may be able to skip them because the eye cream has a luminous finish
my only warning would be to apply in the correct area b/c like all sunscreens it can burn if it gets in the eye
i really like this eye cream because of its consistency
make your eyes water if it gets in your eyes
i really like this cleanser bc it doesn't ever leave my face dry
not too oily for eyes
i saw a review of someone saying don't use for sensitive/dry skin
if you do have dry skin use a toner first
not irritating, doesn't make my eyes sting.
i also love that the cream has spf in it so that i do not have to add another spf eye product over it
if your eyes are stinging or burning you are using too much
i can state with full confidence that if you do not apply more than enough to moisturize you will not have discomfort from the spf
it's hard enough to get him to wash his face every day
doesn't sting my eyes if i accidentally get any in them
i almost forgot i used it because my the time i get in my car in the am i have no more puffiness
more like a cream than a serum or fluid- so a little goes a long way
you can feel the tingle of the cream working after you apply it
be care ful not to rub your eyes after just putting it on
otherwise i break out from sweat
during the winter most cleansers either leave me with flakes on the edge of my nose
does not dry me out at all
everything else i use is either too heavy or too drying/irritating
now it's even more enjoyable to do so after using this cleanser -- my skin is refreshed
doesn't take off heavy or waterproof make-up
i want something fairly natural that won't strip my skin
my face never feels tight or dry after using it
clean extra oil on my whole face
also have the milk cleanser which was great for the winter when my skin was a little more dry
has not dried out my skin
it does not leave a soapy film on my skin
it's difficult for me to find products that don't irritate or dry my skin out
i just need a small amount to cleanse my face
refreshing but not drying.
it doesn't leave the face too dry
it's not the best at preventing oily skin throughout my day
doesn't dry it out
likely not good for dry skin.
t's difficult for me to find a cleanser that doesn't irritated my skin or dry it completely
because it makes the product even more foamy
because it isn't oily or drying at all
this does not strip my skin of oil
does not make my dry
won't sting if it gets in your eyes
the foam keeps its foaminess long enough to wash your whole face
doesn't excessively dry out your face
i prefer very mild cleansers as i know how that "squeaky clean" feeling is actually very drying to your skin
this cleanser doesn't make your skin feel dry or taught afterwards
i felt like it wasn't really cleaning my face because the foam disappears really fast after you apply it
not too drying for my oily skin
i love this so much cleans my face without drying it out
sometimes in the colder months it can really dry out your skin
it tends to dry me out
caudalie neither dries my skin out nor irritates it
does not irritate my dry skin at all
dry or leave my skin greasy
although it might be a little drying feeling
also doesn't dry it out
this stuff does the trick without drying my skin out
i can use this cleanser no matter how my skin is misbehaving
it works in the summer months when my skin is really oily
those werent enough that i ended up with oily residue while oily skin cleansers just made my skin tight
squeaky clean feeling yet not harm dry areas
it is perfect and doesn't dry me out at all!
my combination/oily skin was dry in the t-zone
it cleans very well, and not dry at all.
the toner spurts all over the place when you try to put it onto a cotton pad
when my face is more oily
my skin does not feel dry after washing
what i love about this cleanser is it cleanses my face without drying it out or breaking it out either
foamy enough that i don't have that "did i get enough soap" feeling
it does not irritate the skin
when i use this product my skin does not get dry or irritated
i do not find it drying
doesn't dry my combination skin out
however, it's a bit too drying for my skin.
i think this could be a better face wash for those with oily skin
i usually use about 2 big pumps on my clairsonic
my skin doesn't dry out when i use clinique
i saw a comment that said it didnt lather so you should lather it in your h
i usually use just water or a oil-based balm to wash the other time
keeps my oils at bay without making my skin look or feel dry
best face wash till date for a person like me who has a super sensitive skin
it does a really good job at cleansing my skin without drying me out
i hate those cleansers that with you with a tight feeling afterward
not overpowering like so many other face washes out there
i typically use an additional moisturizer before make-up application as sometimes my skin becomes dry after all three steps
he told me that my acne was caused from me washing my face too much
i just switched back to using this face wash along with the moisturizer because i just feel like my face is so dirty from living in the city
gentle enough to not strip or irritate my dry patches
this face wash doesn't dry out my skin
this face wash has become a staple in my daily routine because it doesn't dry out your skin
doesn't dry me out like other face washes have in the past
my skin would always clear up instantly
this does not overly dry out my skin
it works really well with my clairsonic face brush
even though i have very oily skin
it doesn't dry me out
only 4 stars b/c the drying effect in cold weather isn't great on my chin
that it doesn't overly dry my already dry/combo skin
the extra mild when my skin needs the extra tlc
doesn't irritate my skin at all
it is the best cleaner that wont over dry my face out
and i have tried so many face washes.
this face wash is very mild
doesn't make my skin flare up
everything else dries out my face.
not so dry so this works for me
because extra mild is too oily
not for dry skin because a little dry
maybe you can use two cleaner mild
use the "oily" kind
doesn't dry my face out excessively
doesn't irritate my skin at all
the only thing i should note is after a while the soap became a little watery
it sometimes can leave my face a little tight if i don't moisturize afterward
it doesn't dry it out
i actually have rather oily skin
your skin will clear up
just do not over wash!
i love to use this face wash all through summer .
it's gotten rid of my oily skin
it doesn't leave it dry
sometimes the extra mild when my skin goes through dry periods
i really like this face wash.
it doesn't make my face feel dried out either!
in the spring/summer i'm usually a little more oily
this is literally the only face wash i can use!
if i switch to any other cleanser i will break out
but the mild dried me out so bad!
immediately you notice it is not like the mild soap
not drying at all!
doesn't dry out my skin when used with the other 3-step products
doesn't dry out my skin
do not use on your face if you have dry skin!
i find that the oily formula is wonderful for my oily skin
this in extra mild feels like a nice cleansing milk
i don't use harsh cleansers that strip oils as i find this worsens the problem- skin tends to overcompensate for the lost oils
i think this just might be my go-to cleanser when my skin starts acting out
i prefer the extra mild one
it doesn't dry off my skin
i think this is a great face wash for someone beginning to take care of their skin
this is perfect to use on my eyes once lathered in my h
although i normally have pretty good skin with a pimple here
once you wash it off
i ordered the mild version even though my skin is oily
it prevents my face from getting oily throughout the day better than any other primer ive ever used
it keeps my t-zpne oil free while not drying out the rest of my face
this primer really kept my face matte for a longer time than usual
it requires extreme moisturizer underneath even though my skin is oily
i only give it 4 stars because the lady at sephora told me that it helps minimize pores overtime
sometimes your skin might have to get used to the tea tree oil at first
nothing really helped until i found thins
which has a lot of fine lines that wont disappear with drinking lots of water
lasts longer than any mat primer i have tried
i feel like it just didn't cover my large pores
i would definitely recommend for people with large pores or oily skin
my face did not get oily
even though it is also mattifying
wintertime where you are
this is a primer that is not meant to smooth all over your face
that would make my face super oily
i wear it alone with a dash of setting powder
sometimes i feel like it balls up
outside of my t-zone is like the desert with dryness
if it can dry my greasy face up
it will dry out
so far this one works best for my combination skin with oily t-zone
only primer i've found to control my oily t zone!
packaging is a bit off since a lot can squirt out at once
this does not dry me out or irritate my skin
the smell of tea tree oil than this product might bother you a bit
it didn't irritate my skin or break me out
nor does it dry out my skin excessively like other primers might
i literally have the most oily skin in the world
for days when i don't feel like caking my face
the only thing is the smell which i can get over fast i spray body mist right after i put on
don't think it really helps mattifying for long or prolong the wear of my foundation
i still have my smashbox primer
when uncontrollable oil is less of a problem for me
it can cake up a bit or emphasize dryness
then it looked like i didn't have any open pores at all
i got recommended this primer when no other primer would cover my huge pores around my nose
but this primer kept my oils away!
i highly recommend if you have an oily t-zone
it doesn't make me oilier like the benefit poreffesional
with this product i feel very comfortable going out wearing only a pore minimizer
was hook i have a very oily t-zone with big pores
this right here did its job i put it on right away didn't see pores very soft to your skin also made my make up look matte
oil this is for you
especially if i skimp on sleep
i used it the next morning with nothing else except my highlighter no foundation no setting spray or powder
6 hours of doing physical work in warmer than i would like ac
/or too dry/oily
never makes me greasy
it is maybe not the most ideal of dry skin because it doesn't feel the most wet
so don't expect it to cure really dry skin
they had my skin a mess
they all felt too thick
i am on the look out for a moisturizer for night time that is not oily for me
i can actually see my face cleaner
so not for those with ultra dry skin
i've noticed that my skin doesn't seem nearly as oily at end's day
easy to use by pumping it into your h
don't find it to be too heavy for my skin
put back the moisture that my skin needed
so far i've found that there is no daytime lotion i can use that will satisfy the dryness
a heavier cream to only the areas that need it
it also does balance out the parts of my face that are oily
this fall weather has been making it super dry
the hot water makes my face really sensitive during the fall/winter
it doesn't make my skin greasy at all
rather than simply pumping it into my h
i feel like i could use a little more moisture though since i use the all over blemish solution it tends to dry me out
cleared up my acne that had been really resistant to anything else i tried
it's great if you have dry or sensitive skin
i do not like the other cleansers that leave my face either too oily/creamy or too clean
while it does leave a residue after i wash it off with water
i cannot feel any leftover product
foams—pretty much everything is too drying
at the same time wouldn't dry you out
every single cleanser i used dried my skin out or made me break out
my lines were getting worse due to all the cleansers i used
it is not just for the dry skin types
flaky skin i can proudly say this helped get rid of all of the flakiness
definitely recommend this product to others with dry skin
not dry out my skin
it does not strip away the oils your skin needs.
have a good cleaning routine for your face is essential to having great skin
apply a decent amount to cover my face
t's nice to know that when i feel kinda lazy before bedtime i can just manually lather this creamy cleanser on my face
winter when my skin needs extra care
i don't think it would work very well for oily skin
it felt like there was still cleanser on my skin after washing it off since it's so creamy
also using the wet cloth makes your face feel more refresh
it takes off eye make up also without making your eyes water
flaky in the winter despite how much lotion i use after washing my face
great if you are super dry.
does not leave any greasy residue
i don't even put moisturizer on after cleansing with this stuff because it makes my skin feel so smooth
with cold weather my skin begs for more moisture
the biggest plus point is that in using this product you get the clean feeling without the oily residue that i have found in other facial cleansers for dry skin
this serum doesn't keep my face oily at all
at first its so sticky and you feel it all day!
it gets peely in the cold
you put it on and fine lines melt away.
many serums just run right off your face
goes on super smooth, not sticky at all.
i find my skin is much more even in color
my dry patches are pretty much gone when i apply foundation
of course my skin is getting dryer
this morning not only is my skin not so dry it's cracking
it does leave your skin a little sticky
i decided to only use it at night because it makes my skin oily
apply when your face is damp to extend it.
it was even worse being in the winter weather
without being greasy at all
usually when my skin's feeling extra dry
it's one of the few things that keeps my from getting dry
my face is really dry
i don't know if it actually lightens the skin
even when it's dry or sensitive
not too light nor too heavy.
most products make my eyes water
just continue using it after every time you wash your face
stripping my skin of necessary ones too
i am very happy that i won't need to pay money for a tiny tube for eye cream
found it to be too heavy for day wear
actually feels more like a gel
so when it's not hot outside i use this alone under makeup
for those acne prone/very sensitive skin i have had very good luck with this entire line along side fresh
fortunately my skin is usually clear
sometimes it gets super oily
she says the cream is not too oily/sticky
burned mine like the dickens.
i will say i have dry-combination skin
f you are oily then this won't work for you cause it is a bit greasy
even on my dry skin
does not leave my skin white
i still use it during the winter months as the heating system in my office building tends to dry my skin out
my face was not oily
other creams would leave my skin having dry spots at the end of the day
i is not too heavy or greasey
my skin is oily in some areas and dry in others.
winter is very dry here
my face can get pretty dry during the winter
not greasy at all
doesn't make my face oily in the process
thick enough for the winter
it stings a little right after washing my face on dry areas
in the winter i tend to use more on my dry areas
they all left my face very oily
does not feel oily at all
might feel a bit like sunscreen when you first put it on
first you get the feeling of you are applying a sunblock as you setting on a pool
does not cause me to break out like a lot of other moisturizers with spf do
it's really moisturizing without being greasy or leaving that awful film on top of your skin
were so thick because of the spf
you can barely tell there is spf in this cream because it is not thick
does not leave a residue
does not get oily even at the end of the day.
tend to get really dry around my cheecks
girls with combo dry skin, you need to try this!
it made me so greasy
my skin is less oily after using it
perhaps it is giving my skin the moisture it needs so that is doesn't need to overproduce oil?
it really helped regenerate some moisture without making my skin break out or very oily
tend to run on the oily side
yet not too oily or heavy on the skin
it has really done a lot for my dry aging skin
never feels heavy or greasy
i do find that my face stings a little if i apply right after scrubbing my face
doesn't make my face feel greasy either
not sure if it does anything for my skin other than moisturizing
although i have oily skin
this moisturizer doesn't make me oily even though its for normal to dry skin
absorbs so fast you don't have to wait for it to completely settle on your skin
this product doesn't make me oily at all
the only problem is lancome does not fill the jar to the top
doesn't make your make up cake up
it tends to leave my skin more shiny than i would prefer
this cream works great for me since i have dry skin
doesn't dry out my skin or leave me greasy
its like a drink for you face
usually anything with spf
i learned that you should never use dial soap on your face
i didn't really noticed that this clogged my pores until i put it on alone one day
so go for it if your skin is super dry
otherwise steer clear or try the lotion version of this
she says it not heavy or greasy
this doesn't dry out my combination skin
also sometimes in a very thin layer under make up during the day if i have a problem spot
this product really works at clearing up problem areas without drying out the skin
it does not dry your skin out at all
you can feel a bit of tingling as the salicylic acid does it's stuff
it can dry out the skin
i don't use it all over my face as prevention because i'm trying to conserve my stash
it not greasy or sticky at all
doesn't dry skin out or cause it to get flaky
applying this under my make-up helps keep my skin clear
i also use it at night to quickly dry up small breakouts
doesn't dry out the skin
it is not greasy at all
if it's rolling up on your skin
i used my sample last night to clear up some disgusting pimples that had developed all over my face
didn't make my skin burn
it almost felt like i was putting givenchy's mister mat
it can be a little drying
it does its work without drying up the skin which is one of the problems i had with previous treatments
even if i squeeze out those nasty clogged pores in the t-zone
does not over dry my skin like most products
wait about a minute then apply diorskin forever foundation with my beautyblender sponge
i usually put it on nightly where i seem to sometimes have clogged pores or blemishes coming up
it doesn't dry out my skin or make it flaky
i could tell after 3 uses i had a "glow" to my skin
the cool thing is that it does not dry out yiur skin
it does not dry your skin at all.
you can apply a tiny bit just under your foundation to give a flawless finish with out worring about cloggin pores
sometimes i alternate between the two when my face feels extra oily
i am 50 but still have dry/ and oily areas.
this cream is in no way oily even with summer high humidity
i do not wash my face after using it
it moisturizes a lot yet it is not greasy at all
which for someone with oily skin
on about how dry my skin was
not so thick that it feels like a mask
in winter i need that lil extra drink of moisture
i think it may have been stored at too low a temperature somewhere during delivery process
for the first time in my life i have dry skin
most other creams would leave my skin dehyrated by the end of the day
i wish it came in a tube or a pump so that air doesn't get in
very dry in the winter
on about how dry my skin was
they don't make my t-zone oily
they really absorb into the skin
this is great for intense night moisture.
i did not use on my forehead since i was oily there
it doesn't not make me oily at all
this doesn't seem to aggravate it like other heavy moisturizers can
it is not greasy by any means
not too oily or thick
it's not too heavy and it does hydrate well.
skin just alone on face
love this face oil
it's the only product that gives my skin the moisture it needs
it will be greasy
while i don't have dry skin
most anti-aging products tend to make my face oily
i usually do like 5 pumps
this will not deep clean your skin it's just that first step before cleansing
not too oily, not too sticky.
the only reason i didn't give it five starts is that i haven't yet tried the cleansing balm or the oil
put it on a dry face
not drying at all.
hot weather is not good
using water to just rinse it off is a ridiculous idea
but i'll give the balm a try.
you may want to check out the take the day off balm instead
then i can either follow-up with my normal face wash or moisturizer
i love this product because it takes off my make up without drying my skin
it burns pretty bad if you get in your eyes.
i found it to be more effective if you apply it with your fingers
nothing harsh on the skin and no residue.
i like to use this with my bioderma or my sephora micellar water after
i also like to splash my face with water after to get rid of any residue
it doesn't dry my skin
or anything more than clean gently
i then wash off with warm water
on the flip side this product doesn't dry out my skin like most makeup removers
this does a good job of getting it off my skin so that my cleanser is more effective
however i find it works better when rinsed off
it really helped my skin clear up because i didn't realize that just because i washed my face each night
it doesn't live my skin dry
i only gave it four stars because it isn't the best thing ever for oily skin
this stuff burns if it gets anywhere near my eyes or mascara
it does not leave my skin feeling oily like most of the make up remover wipes that i have tried
i think this would be wonderful if i had drier skin
i just didn't read the last part "ideal for drier skin"
it's gentle enough that my skin does not become irritated when i use my usual daily cleanser afterwards
does not leave a residue
doesn't leave that residue
it does not make me sweat
your skin will love it
not greasy at all
i find myself applying a layer of clinique's moisture surge over this when my skin is extra dry
oily even after using this under my foundation
the only problem is a bit kind of shine when applying
if it can be matte will be prefect!
i no longer have that extra step of putting on sunscreen underneath my foundation
great for "not" so dry skin.
it's almost like rubbing milk on your face.
my oily areas much less oily
there is no greasy
i can vouch that my extreme dry spots are no longer :
it still had spf
having to worry that i am oily again
i can't wait to wash my face
moisturizing products they absorb into your skin yet leave it feeling great all day
found it so hydrating that i often use it alone
it seems to dry up fast too
except during the summer when i won't need this much moisture
it's thick but doesn't leave your face oily.
i prefer it over their cream
humidity is low and the air is very dry.
definitely recommend for normal-to-dry skin.
my skin is pretty normal--never too dry or oily
i tend to break out
night since it is the only one i've found that moisturizes my skin without making me break out
don't apply the cream there
over the winter my skin got really dry
this is the only cream i have found that is thick
doesn't make my skin oily or make me breakout
greasy which is why i only use this eye cream at night
not enough for dry skin
i can literally feel my skin drinking it up!
healthy skin that i don't have to wipe the oil off of
this really helped get rid of flaky dry skin.
it still didn't feel greasy at all
it doesn't feel as dry as it did before.
especially for people with dry skin
it does not give me a sticky/oily feeling which is great
the cream is thick, but not heavy.
now, it doesn't get oily at all.
some products make my t-zone very oily
i realize by using this product that my skin is not very very dry
nice night cream for my dry skin type especially during this colder weather
it gets a little oily
getting my face wet
the oily part is gone
it does not make my face oily in the morning nor make my face oily during the day
it sinks in right away without being too heavy or oily
just not giving me enough moisture
i like this one because it is not greasy
when applied properly it makes your skin feel like silk
save yourself from wrinkly face for this holiday
it gets more dry
not something for people who are dry/super dry.
although it is a little greasy
which gets even worse in the colder months
my skin is extra dry
my skin is not dry anymore
if your skin is very dry
that one feels more oily
with my extra dry skin
especially during the drier/colder months
when my skin can use the extra moisture
i highly recommend this for anyone that's looking to soothe their dry skin
it is just as perfect in humidity as well as in dry weather
because i have dry skin
i usually don't like face cream out of a container
not greasy or sticky
not at all greasy.
or they feel so oily
greasy i stop using them
i definately recommend this for people with combination skin that need moisture
i would definantly recomend this cream to anyone who needs a little extra moisture
i also get dried easily
i also love the pump bottle so your fingers never touch the product that is yet to be used
or else it can be a little too heavy on my skin
i don't have much oily problem with it in the t-zone
let it sink into your skin
i've read some negative rumors that it can pull moisture from your skin
it doesn't make me feel all oily after applying
for the past 10+ years i have been trying heavier creams trying to get enough moisture into my skin
it feels like silk when i apply it
my skin can get dry
my this winter is getting very dry.
i like how i could see how much i'm using up with its translucent bottle
one pump is enough to cover my face
it is not thick as far as consistency goes so you don't feel like you have a layer of gunk on your face when you sleep
i feel very comfortable even in dry winter nights
let my skin absorb it
probably my skin needs something heavier
us older glams need all the moisture we can get
it didn't make my oily t-zone worse either.
it's totally worth the price if you have any dry skin areas
sensitive skin break outl would be great for dry skin that doesn't react with petroleum based products
i don't know how to get rid of this besides having the fat sucked out under my eyes
get milia very easily
if it gets in your eyes it can really sting
it seems to linger for awhile before finally soaking in
i don't buy eye cream yet because usually the face cream i use is thick enough for my eye area
if you suffer from dry
not sticky at all
it can look oily
maybe it will be too heavy for summer?my eye wrinkles completely disappear immediately
do not use it on my lids
this is the most hydrating cram i have ever used.
my eyes don't look flaky and dry anymore.
is that it does go on a little greasy
it does seem to absorb after 10-15 minutes
this cream tends to be a little on the greasy side
it does feel a little oily
great for those of us who suffer from dryness
it is good for day as long as you use a teeny tiny bit--otherwise i have a hard time getting any concealer to stay put on top of it
however i do find that it's great for "plumping" the eye area
i recommend for dry under eyes.
just what my dry delicate under eye needs
it will make you feel greasy
as i do not have the crepe paper skin when i use it
if you use anymore than a little bit it will appear greasy because the cream is so rich
can ruin your mascara during a hot day so you might need to touch up your undereye more often
even the morning after you can still feel your skin plump
this eye cream was suggested to me by one of the sas at sephora for my very dry skin
no matter what i tried nothing worked to hydrate my under eye area
my under eye area didn't look dry or "crepey" it is expensive
it does't irritate my sensitive eye area.
i didn't find that it was heavy or sticky for night time use
this product is not thick at all.
they don’t leave a film or residue
if you're too tired to take off makeup or you just need to freshen up
it doesn't absorb quickly at all
one jar lasts me a long time
it is super oily/greasy as many other reviews say however i need that in/around my eyes
they didn't dry my skin out
these do the best job of leaving my face clean without irritating it or breaking it out
so far these are one of two facial wipes that doesn't burn the heck out of my face
does not dry my skin out or leave it oily.
doesn't dry out my already dry skin
they do not leave a sticky or oily residue nor did it cause any breakouts
i love these cleansing sheets because it really cleans off eye/face make up with out drying out my skin
i found that they would either dry my skin out
were not saturated enough
would make my skin oilier or cause me to break out
this is when i realized i need to keep cleansing wipes readily available
don't leave a film on my skin
i could easily use half a towel to cleanse my entire face if i wanted
i love to use it to take off my make up without irritating my skin
it is the only face wash i found that truly cleansed my skin without irritation
these are also great for gym or when you are too tired to actually wash your face
probably a good face scrub
just one sheet does an phenomenal job of thoroughly cleaning your face without making it feel too dry or tight
these cleansing sheets are a great alternative if there just isn't enough time to wash all your makeup off before bed
it felt even better because i rinsed the cloth in cold water before i took off my make-up
it comes in a hard plastic container which i like better than the soft wrappers wipes usually come in since it's easier to seal
i am so happy i didn't give up on finding the perfect cleansing wipe
if you don't make completely sure the top is closed tightly they can dry out
don't dry out my skin
don't blame these cloths for not being able to win the battle against my mascara
without drying out my skin or making it feel oily
i don't bother washing it
combo/dry skin which can easily become irritated
they're no better than my regular cleansing sheets
i recomend it for those that sometimes skip a full face wash before bed
don't leave a residue after i use them as some other br
don't dry out your skin
they don't burn my eyes
i don't know if it is effective against water-proof mascara
it doesn't leave my skinfeeling dry or greasy.
don't give my sensitive or oily skin any problems with icky residue
living in the bush in africa means you sometimes don't have running water
they don't dry out your skin
they don't leave a residue on your skin.
it's a great way to cleanse your skin while you're on the go
they are great to freshen up when you travel too
fast easy won't dry your face...great for travel!
it is important that the wipes not dry out
these do not dry out.
it is not too wet
it doesn't dry out
some nights i just cant bare to go through my whole cleansing system
i love using these sheets when i'm on the go or don't have time to wash my face
sometimes i use them when i'm feeling too lazy to wash my face at night as well
at first i was nervous about it bc the sheets don't feel completely saturated
i am definitely going to buy the bottle of pureness as well as restock on these travel sheets
t's much easier to wash the rest off
these lightly fragranced sheets do exactly what is claimed
you can definitely survive off these little wipes when you are unable to get to a sink too
not dry or sticky
trying to find something good for travel or quick cleanup at the end of a long day when i'm just too tired to wash my face properly
i know you should wash your face before bed
do not leave me soaking wet before i hit my pillow
all with out leaving any residue or oil on my skin
was only too happy to go back to these amazing cleansing sheets
they are mild on your skin
this milk wash was exactly what my dry
still be light enough to not aggravate my oily areas
dry out my skin outside of my tzone
not dry or tight at all
my t zone barely gets oily at all now
i can tell the difference it feels so much lighter than my usual moisturizer
doesn't break my skin out.
it also doesn't leave that greasy feeling some face creams do
my skin looks parched when i wake up if i use only this before bed
it definitely leaves my skin less oily than anything else
find this to be the perfect amount of moisture for me
don't feel it sitting on my skin all day like some moisturizers tend to do
not greasy at all
doesn't make my skin feel oily after put it on everyday
others made my face too oily
in the summer it tends to get more oily.
in the winter, it's more dry.
it makes it less oily
takes forever to get the amount i need for my face/neck area
it is not enough moisture for me in the winter.
i also normally have a very oily face.
it doesn't give me enough moisture during winter when my skin is constantly bombarded with dry heater air
this is a must have for combo/oily skin during the summer
i think what some don't like in this moisturizer is that once this product dries down
it hardly feels like you have anything on your face because we're all used to that greasy/oily feeling after using a moisturizer
always had trouble finding a moisturizer that didn't make me any more oily
i do agree the glass bottle is a bit too heavy
i would only recommend this product for people with oily skin
made my skin feel dry -- this product doesn't do that
maybe because i have super oily skin
i think those w/ slightly oily skin would like this
people with oily skin will love it
doesnt feel greasy or sticky
have oily skin that tends to break out more as an adult than it ever did during my adolescent years
honestly i underestimated this moisturizer thinking that by morning i'm probably gonna wake up with another humongous zit on my forehead
my face wasn't oily
was in desperate need of good moisturizer for my troublesome
a residue or any other evidence on your skin except a very nice
my skin tends to be oily in the t-zone
usually dry in other areas
definitely doesn't feel like it is clogging your pores or anything
not greasy at all
you still need an spf on top
doesn't make my face any oily-er like other moisturizers tend to
this is really good if you want to use other products on top like spf/bb cream/tinted moisturizer etc because it doesn't feel heavy whatsoever
i apply it after all my routines thick.
it keeps my face moisture all night long.
my oily skin is as balanced as it's going to get
a good way to test if your cleanser is too harsh/drying is if your face feels tight after washing
doesn't make my skin dry
my only gripe is that its a little runny so you have you be quick or it'll slide right off your finger
have gone back to this because other ones just don't do the job of moisturizing my skin
my face is unfortunately still oily
it made my face too dry-i will only use it in the summer
i would only recommend for the very oily
practically everything makes me oily
i only have 1 other moisturizer that doesn't make me oily/break out/feel greasy
it doesn't leave my skin sticky or shiny.
doesn't make my skin feel oiler
it goes on smooth and is never oily.
i am not sure if it truely keeps your face matte because i use oil absorbing wipes
i still find a lot of oil on my t-zone
my face tends to shine/get oily around evening
it does not contain any anti-aging properties nor anything else that one typically looks for in a moisturizer
i really love adding a bit of it to my primer to make it more spreadable
i used make up forever due matte foundation over it
my face didn't get shiny or oily for hours
easily absorb and not too oil .
super dry because i can't put any moisturizer on it because i look like an oil field if i do
they always make my skin crazy oily
you need so little to cover your whole face due to the liquid-y consistence that the bottle will last a long time
its a good moisturizer for oily skin for sure you get the moisture without feeling that heavy cream/oil on the skin after about 2-3 mins im ready for my foundation
it does not stay on the surface of your skin with is a big plus for me
i live in really humid weather
not oily at all after using this
specially if you leave it on the fridge before
that's just me because my skin naturally gets really oily after just a couple hours
have difficulty in finding a moisturizer that doesn't make my makeup slide off of my face or make me feel/look like an oil slick
because is for oil control/very oily skin
you don't need a lot to cover your face/neck as it is really light
does not leave your skin dry or oily
you will still need some kind of mattifier or oil blotting sheets later
it might not be moisturizing enough for dry skin during other time of the year
this does leave a dewy sheen so people who prefer matte finishes should stay away from this cream
if your skin gets oily like mine
like when you rub alcohol
it's the only moisturizer where i don't get greasy or little red bumps
this moisturizer provides plenty of moisture to the thirsty areas of my face without making me break out
it works well if your skin is slightly dry.
i don't get wind burn when i wear it on a cold windy day
i recommend this for people with combination to oily skin
usually don't have any problems until i come to the moisturizer
it definitely is not for dry skin
because my skin is drier in the winter months
it is the only moisturizer that doesn't break me out or make me oily
you only need to put on a few spots of the gel on your face
other days it would be oily
doesn't feel greasy or oily
even in the texas heat, this is not too heavy.
i don't wake with breakouts or an oil slick in my t zone
it is perfect for for someone like me who has oily-combination skin
i like the way it feel on my skin
it does leave some oily residue though
no more dry skin ;)
i really like this product because i have oily skin
i apply it to areas that are dry without it making me look oily all around
you don't need to use a huge glob of it which is great
it gives me extra moisture without the oily/heavy weight to it
gives a really nice moisture to your face
it doesn't overpower or weigh down on your face
keep in mind i don't have sensitive skin
only bad thing is it does make skin a little more oily after use
as they tend to leave me greasier than i am naturally
during the day i found my skin actually feeling less oily than usual
i just wish it had sun protection.
t it was a good balance for my skin needs during winter -it provided enough moisture in the dry air without clogging my pores
feels like you adding water to the skin
greasy feel that regular creams have that are made specifically for dry skin are
i don't feel dry right after applying it or like i have a ton of greasy stuff on my face
generally have a very difficult time finding a product that hydrates my dry cheeks
i'll probably need something a little more hydrating next fall/winter
i needed an extra boost of moisturizer b/c my cheek areas felt a little dry/tight
didn't get absorbed into the skin that well
my sensitive skin didn't break out at all
the smell is so minimal you don't even notice it
a little bit of an oily t-zone
as well as not clog my pores or make my skin produce more oil that it needs to
it's not quite intensive enough to keep my skin from flaking in some areas
not too heavy or too light!
give enough moisture for my combination skin.
i dont like to feel such a heavy cream when i put on my skin
because the next morning still i feel stickiness
it is fab and does the job with no residue.
all you need is a dab
it gives me just the right amount of moisture i need without making me greasy
it is great if you have oily or combination skin.
it works like a charm without causing me to be too oily or causing breakouts
it's doesn't leave me parched either
perfect for summer or humid areas
doesn’t leave a heavy or greasy finish
does not leave a greasy film at all
i always take a jar with me on vacation in case i get too much sun
as my skin tends to get dry during the day
though i have oily skin
it just couldn't keep my skin moisturized for more than an hour or so
give it a try if you've been searching for something very moisturizing that won't feel like a greasy mask on your skin
since i have mostly oily skin
if your skin is dry it can be used during day as well
cold air made my skin so dry
if u have dry skin.
some people may not like the sticky feeling
it is not heavy and not too light.
can't live without it especially in winter.
i read that the lack of moisture in my skin should actually be causing breakouts
not really greasy either.
a small dab is all i need for my entire face
if you are on the oilier end
may skip your nose end just to avoid shine
it never made my skin too oily
i reluctantly tried to this moisturizer thinking it may be too heavy
it does not leave my skin grease
as soon as it gets warm or humid
but for cold, dry weather, nothing beats it.
my skin is starting to simply peel off
it's not too thick to where you feel like your face is suffocating
feels like you've splashed fresh mountain spring water on your face when applied
they never seem to measure up to the shiseido creams
you can refill the glass part for your vanity or make-up area
i don't need it for any anti-aging yet as i've stayed out of the sun my whole life
it is not greasy
my face didn't look oily during the day.
does not feel sticky on the face
it doesn't make my skin oily or mess up my makeup
needed extra moisture without feeling greasy
this product does plump up your face
unless i had heavy sun exposure
have never found a skin toner that didn't break me out
i wouldn't use this in the summer because it is very thick
would probably make my oily skin break out
not greasy or heavy
it would be easy to overdo it
not at all greasy
thinking this would be too thick
i actually have oily skin
take such good care of my skin
it doesn't feel greasy or heavy at all.
may be alittle to heavy for very warm weather.
i usually have a reaction to face creams especially if they have a scent or any type of "anti-aging" solution
i don't always use this as a face cream especially in the day time as it gives my combination skin an oily appearance
as my skin has a tendency to break out
it really helps get rid of flakey skin
while i didn't really have use for them in the summer with my super-oily skin
i practically forgot i have super dry skin
because with regular use my skin is never dry anymore
i do not use this in the morning at the moisturizer before my makeup because my face tends to get really oily
i found this to be heavier than i'd like for a day cream
it doesn't make your skin break out
it doesn't make my sensitive eyes run
when i have a tan i wear it alone even to the office
my countenance is all covered so the small bottle should last me a long time
not sure about humid climates though
they say guys have thicker facial skin
does not make my skin massively oily
i call it a "softener" because it really does soften my skin
i will say that this does not radically lighten the brown
it does lighten them to the point they don't show thru my tinted moisturizer
i think i'll just stick to the fake tan now
maybe this product works to "whiten" if you give it a long time to work
it does make my forehead shiny in the morning though when i use it
my skin is normal to dry in the winter
it feels a bit too heavy if i use sunscreen
the only downside is that i have to wait a few minutes before applying foundation/powder or else i'll get some sort of clumps on my checks
many reviewers have said this dried out their skin
perhaps because i have very oily skin to begin with
i agree with some reviews that said it feels like it sucks all the moisture out of the skin
i actually like that because it feels like it prepares my skin to absorb the serums
that being said i have pretty normal to oily
the only time i switch it up a little is in the dryer winter months when my skin needs a little more moisture or i use an oil
can be used to wash the whole face
it didn't feel dry at all to me
get a good lather from
the only down side to this would be that its a little drying
after i pat my face dry
probably my favorite face wash of all time.
there is no drying out or tightness after you wash
just a little drop can clean your whole face
this foam can remove some make up
otherwise your skin will get a little bit dry
seriously love how so little foams up into a ton.
i do not use waterproof stuff
i can see why some reviews say that it's drying so maybe not the best for drier skin types
this is pretty drying for me
i only use it at night because it is rather drying
forever will this be my go-to face wash.
this doesn't dry or strip.
i don't use it as much these days because my skin is getting drier due to the cold weather
you only need a dime size drop of it to get a nice foamy lather
the sample lasted me a while because it foams quite easily
i did notice that once i rinsed it
i would suggest this product for normal to oily skin
after cleansing my face i felt my skin got a little tighter as i have dry to combination skin thus i have to use a moisturizer after washing my face
this cleaner is just for normal wash it can't be used for removing make up
i can really see my face getting brighter after using the cleanser
i only use it once a day-at night to remove make up because it can dry your skin which is no problem for me
yet it lathers up really well
it does strip your face of moisture if you have some dry patches
the blue lower end shiseido cleanser does the job at only
it can leave the skin very dry
have clear skin for life with this face wash
not greasy at all.
dried out my skin too much
don't expect a cleanser to clean your skin if it cannot reach your skin- lol
if it makes your skin too dry or feel " not clean" then maybe your skin type has other needs
i feel 100% clean on my skin but not dry at all.
which i personally prefer since i think if your skin turns bright so fast that means it contains "bleach?"
however it does lather a little bit
it doesn't dry up my skin at all
it makes my face super clean without drying it out
this is the first cleanser i use from shiseido n i am in live with it it cleans n keep my face toned n clean all my make up off its wroth the money
i like how when you rub it into your face it gets so bubbly
it seems difficult to find a decent cleanser that will not only unclog your pores
it tends to dry out
after using this my skin is neither oily or dry
this cleanser really does leave your skin a lot brighter
it's also a very gentle formula that won't irritate or dry out your skin
does not leave the face oily.
even wash out of the foundation on my face!
about half a dime is good to get your skin clean
clear now that i feel confident to go out wearing zero foundation or powder
will already start to bubble once you've massaged it on your face
not irritated or dry
it's foamy so you only need a little for your whole face
without drying out my skin too much
it gives you a lot of foam
it does not feel drying out your skin.
you can feel how soft it's making your skin as you wash
so much so that when i ordered a refill
although my skin didn't
you don't need much for a rich lather
doesn't not leave the sensitive eye or face feeling tight or dry
which means it will have more surface area to pick up dirt
because it wash out too much oil from face.
i love the consistency of this face wash.
how clean my skin feels afterward make this worth the extra money
i need something to clean my sensitive skin
my skin is less oily in the t-zone area
just a little drop foams and goes a long way.
it's a very light moisturizer so you might want to put something over it if your skin is dry
it doesn't leave your skin tight or dry after use
cannot really judge if it brightens
it doesn't sting unless the makeup itself gets into the eyes it's so creamy
does not leave me over dry
this is the only spf that i've found that doesn't add to the oily feeling
is not good for those with dry skin
perfect for combination to oily though
i do think it brightens your skin if used religiously
so not sure how well it would do against winter-parched skin
yet still gives my skin the moisture it needs
i find it light
yet it does not leave my skin dry
am noticing i need a wee bit more moisture than before so this does the trick quite nicely without being greasy
this product is not oily or heavy
yet it doesn't lighten my skin as much as the other products from the "white lucent" line so visibly does
otherwise my skin feels really dry as if i skipped putting any moisturizers at all
i read in many reviews that people complain it dries out their skin
provided enough moisture for my az-stressed skin without making me look shiny
seems to dry very quickly
unlike other moisturizers with spf that leave a soggy thick feeling on your face after application
i think would be great for dry skin too
not sure if this is the cream for oily skin however
may be too thick for summer.
dewy when you put it on
i could feel the hydration to my skin the second i put it on my face
it works really well in my skin (dry).
a cream with spf 15 when it's cold outside/
i found it to absorb really quick
so probably not good for people with dry skin
definietly need more moisture in the winter
i think it works well because the white lucent cleanser can feel a bit drying
my skin feels protected against the harsh winter air/wind
you should put it on maybe 20 minutes before bed or it might rub off on your pillow
as for moisture best i have ever used
so good if you tend to be oily or break out think twice
i would only recommend this to people with dry skin
if your skin isn't terribly dry
suffering from too many times in the sun i find i can not do without the radiance this provides
it's a bit sticky once on your skin
it doesn't make your skin oily
sometimes if i wake up looking tired all i have to do is wash
my skin is the driest you can imagine.
i know that if i don't moisturize properly my skin will age prematurely
i did however notice it made me break out a bit/enlarge my pores so though its a great moisturizer i would only buy it if your skin is on the dry side
so probably a good bet for dry skin types
i may change creams in the future to something with a little more ant-aging oomph
if you are looking to hide the awful bags under your eyes without the use of makeup then this is the product for you
this stuff works great under makeup because it doesn't have a greasy texture
doesn't have a greasy texture afterwards so for me thats a huge plus cause i hate the greasy feel of some of these products
under eyes would get dry
it looks like barely any product in the jar
it dries quickly so that you can put your makeup on pretty quickly
especially in the dry winter
i now feel comfortable using just a light coverage foundation without feeling like a raccoon when i go out
my skin is more dry than it used to be
it is not oily or greasy
you get a lot of product in the pot
i never feel greasy because it absorbs
they lacked the moisture my very dry skin needs
what i'm more concerned about is the quality of the product that does not leave my eyes feeling greasy
it doesn't melt into the corners of my eyes over time like some others do
without being excessive or oily.
one tub of this will last you a very long time.
usually my eyes burn or i break out.
it doesn't irritate or make my eyes water.
i don't think any product could erase that special "new mom" shade of purple that has settled in on my face
i just needed some moisture in that area
there is really nothing unpleasant or bad about this eye cream
i think the dry winter weather in california plus the anti-blemish face wash that i was using caused my skin to really dry out
i don't usually use eye cream because i have in the past
it was the only product that didnt hurt or burn while keeping the area moisturised sans grease
struggle on finding the right cream to provide hydration without any residual greasy feeling or being too thick for my skin to absorb
if you use this as a day eye cream
you really want to let it soak in for atleast 25-30 minutes before you apply makeup other wise the creams moisture can slide to where ever you wipe your face
it does a great job at keeping my eyes moist
doesn't leave my eye area oily
moisturinzing without being greasy or causing my skin to break out
this stuff really really helps with the puffiness it dies take a couple of days yo start seeing results like any produce out of all the eye creams i've tried this one works i use it before i go to bed an in the morning
the wrong cleanser can turn my face into a flaky
doesn't leave my face dry
this is the only product that's cleansed thoroughly without drying my skin out
it doesn't foam up a lot which proves there aren't those harsh chemicals added which i like
usually have oiliness in my t-zone throughout the day
oily skin prone to the very occasional breakout if i use the wrong product
it doesn't dry my face out like the drugstore kind
why i gave 4 starts to this products because it's doesn't foam i'd say even the opposite you apply it on the dry skin massage a little
usually that means its too gentle to keep break outs away
this doesnt dry out my dry spots
it doesnt make my oily spots oily either
i really dislike the slippery gel consistency of it so be careful
it can leave you a tiny bit tight if you are more on the drier side
at first i thought it was a waste since the texture is unusual for a facial wash
t doesn't keep my skin oil-free all day
not dry when done
sometimes i forget to use a moisturizer after it because my skin feels great without it
i am not sure if it is reducing oiliness as i have very oily skin
i normally dispense about a half to full pump onto my clarisonic depending on how much cleansing i need
doesn't dry my skin out either
it also doesn't dry my face out
can feel greasy at some areas
even though this cleanser is gently enough for the dry areas
it makes my skin so smooth without drying or making it too oily
sometimes i get too much from the pump or it slides off my h
the face wash might dry your skin a little bit
it does not dry my skin at all.
it's really hard to find a cleanser that won't irritate my sensitive skin
also won't dry it out either
have dry skin elsewhere
it doesn't dry my skin out
doesn't dry out my dry areas
i like this wash.
natural yet seems to get the job done without needing the harsh chemicals
the gel-action dried me out a bit in the winter
does not foam practically at all
it is so gentle that my face doesn't feel dry
my oily spots were under control with this wash
it took me a while to get used to the gel consistancy though
i've never used a face wash like that
this doesn't really foam up
i noticed that it didn't burn at all
one pump is all you need to create a lather for your entire face
this thankfully didn't irritate my skin
i do find it drying
this is expected when you wear mineral make-up
this cleanser is definitely not going to foam or make you feel like your skin is super duper clean after using it
no more oily or dry patches
some make my skin too dry
some make me more oily
my skin is neither dry nor oily
my only complaint is that it makes my skin so clean i can see all my imperfections
not drying at all after i used it.
won't dry out your skin
they either over dry or don't clease well at all
this is the first facewash i've bought that actually cleases without burning my super sensitive skin
this is the only face wash for combination that i can actually use on my sensitive skin
however, it did not dry out my skin.
es to keeping my skin clear without drying it out
the only thing i don't like is the fact it does not foam up very much while washing your face
oily in t-zone dry elsewhere
since i have oily
i started to get extremely dry
there is definitely a difference in using a wash that is free of harsh chemicals
doesn't have all the harsh chemicals
i can even skip toner
this face wash is so great for my skin
the fact that im not absorbing any petrochemicals into my body
it doesn't foam up which is what most do
its good that it doesn't overly dry out my skin
it's nice to have some that are not loaded with toxins
ren does exactly what it says it will by eliminating the oil on my oily
that is easily overlooked by how well it cleans my skin
this is the only one i've used that makes my skin feel truly clean without stripping it of much needed moisture
need to use gentle products that won't irritate it
i don't have as much dryness or small bumps from washing my face anymore
i realized all the face washes i used were really drying my skin
for some reason all cleansers dry my skin out badly
i would definitely recommend following if up with the evercalm cream to help hold in the moisture
i can only assume that the refreshing feeling goes away because my skin is no longer quenched of thirst nor is it dirty anymore
at night your skin suppose to breath
when my skin is not dry
get why people say their face doesn't feel "clean" enough after washing with the cleansing milk
reactive to many of the other face washes where most of the ones that i've tried were too harsh or too drying
fairly dry everywhere else
that seemed to dry my skin out
other products usually started to irritate my skin after some weeks
most other cleansers left me with that tight-skin feeling after using them
gets eye make up off if you cleanse twice
this is perfect for someone whose skin is on the dry side
i feel like i'm doing something good for my skin when i use this cleanser
is not stripping or irritating in any way
i do not have dry or oily skin
while this product does not irritate nor dry out my sensitive skin
this face wash does not leave me oily or over dry
rinse well, or you will feel a film on your face.
i am very cautious about what i put on my face because it reacts to everything by either drying out
dry my face a bit
then remove it with a warm
my dry patches seem to be reduced as well though not completely gone
this is the only product that i can use after my face wash to bring all of my moisture back into my face
it is just too gentle that cannot even remove oil from t-zone
some places that are less oily
didn't leave my skin feeling exposed or dried out
i figured it might just be the humidity of the shower
therefore it doesn't strip away oils
leave you dried out
does not dry my face out
yet not dry out my skin
no longer oily looking
not all of your eye make-up will rinse off
ered into the sephora store just hoping to get some ideas about super-gentle cleansers
i can never get it to rinse clean
i don't have dry skin
it makes it so soft and doesn't leave a residue.
doesn't dry my skin out
she she couldnt suggest it for oily skin
ok so you need to use this if you have very fragile or sensitive skin
this face wash is great--it is very mild
my face used to be blochy and dry from exyma.
it does not foam at all
it takes off even water-proof mascara like a dream
t's like putting water on your skin
makes sure that eyes are not puffy after no sleep great product
it doesn't sting or burn my eyes
i normally can't tolerate under-eye treatments because i am super sensitive to the caffeine in them
is lacking in a lot of chemical crud that i like to avoid
does not leave a greasy feel either.
seems like a waste because i always have to wipe off the excess
the only thing it lacks is a hint of extra moisture
just need to use little pressure using the pump or it will emit too much gel
go gently because you will end up with too much product
everytime i apply the cream it makes my skin calm down
it doesn't burn a bit
i've never really liked using night creams because they often felt so heavy
i don't feel like i have to wash it off in the morning
felt i had to mix it with quite a bit of oil at night to get enough moisture
not greasy not heavy, just right!
the pump tends to give too much product.
during the cold dry winter in colorado this is the only lotion that saves my face
i never wake up with greasy skin or get blemishes like i do with other dry skin night lotions
it's the right balance of intensive moisturizing without ever being heavy or greasy
i feel like moisturizer is a long term investment so no matter you use at least your keeping your skin moisturized consistently
feels thick at first but dries in so well.
i generally have oily/combo skin so finding something that's hydrating without making me oily
it works great especially with the winter time dry air
this night cream is not irritating at all
the lightweight texture does not do much alone
it's hard to find something that can hydrate my skin without breaking out
this cream doesn't seem to cut it
i don't need to put gasoline on my skin after all
not so rich i break out
this product did not irritate my skin
day cream have made my face much more comfortable
i can trust to keep my flaky patches under control
that combined with their oil is the perfect night time combo for my dry skin
it is not greasy or heavy.
just what i needed to help my dry skin overnight.
it never lays on top of my skin or makes it feel oily in any way
doesn't break you out or leave you feeling like an oil-slick
any flaking i might get during the winter %100
i find it calming once you get accustomed to it
i would definitely recommend it to anyone with sensitive or dry skin
does not leave your face oily looking
my skin get super dry in the winter month
does not break me out like other thick night creams i've used have
i am able to use it on my super-dry
it is not heavy.
its pretty amazing how little amount of this product you really needed to moisturize your face
there are plenty of other good night creams that i don't mind the scent of
i still highly recommend this product to anyone looking to heal dry skin over night
i need the intense moisture for the winter because it gets so dry so this cream is just right for me
once the weather turned i noticed my skin was dry
i don't find it as hydrating as the global day cream which i think is strange since the day cream should be lighter
how my skin can be both oily
this is just the right amount of moisture without breaking out my skin
fewer chemicals you don't need
for those of you that may not be fond of the scent--it usually fades in a few minutes
i want to make sure i don't wake up feeling gunky
it's usually more on the oily side
'm always very hesitant to use night creams or gels because of how oily i will be in the morning
i don't wake up feeling oily or greasy at all.
you know your night cream works when you actually wake up to skin so good that you feel you can just splash some cold water
this is great long-lasting moisture for my skin!
it felt very moisturizing like a traditional thicker night creme however it does not have the greasy or thick after feel whatsoever
also when it did get in my eyes it would burn a little
i hope it helps undo some sun damage
she tends to be more dry
never greasy or sticky
sit on top of your skin rather than get absorbed?
certainly gets the moisture it needs in the dry winter climate where i live
not too dry or oily-
still can't get it to scrub off as recommended
i usually end up washing it off.
this doesn't irritate my skin at all
i received better resuts with trying to scrubing off mask once it dried rather than washing it off
unlike the organic pharmacy's mask that stays rather "wet" feeling
i used this mask once or twice a week when ever i feel a little dull for my skin
somehow it would dry your skin as well
you rub it off
amount because it will be easier to rub off the product with your fingers
you can hardly see my pores!
wasn't too uncomfortable while drying
your skin looks pretty after you use it
the guy at the sephora store said that this is a great detox mask if you have stress in your life
it's odd at first using a dry wash
it makes sense to do that so the aha/bha can slough off dead skin
forehead can peel easily if i use anything too harsh
it doesn't irritate the dry parts
yet is able to draw out the oil from my pores
my pores had tons of "guck" coming out of them that i was able to get out easily with the little h
because of that i needed a little warm water to get all of the residue off
when i removed it i could see that my pores were cleaned out
i tend to have dry skin
this did dry mine out a little
i fight wish under the skin blemishes that never come to the surface
not hot water to get the extra residue off once you rub the mask off
because if you don't seal it up tightly
the pump will totally clog--fyi soaking the pump in hot water helps clear the pump if/when it blocks up
so now i only use it on my nose
it also doesn't worsen it either
i must note that using the mask does feel soothing
i never feel dry
so maybe it is best for someone who feels their skin is oily or has large pores/blackheads
if you leave it on too long it will start to sting your eyes even though you avoid the eye area completely so wash it off before that happens
getting it out of the container, however, i hate.
just wash it off with warm water instead of rubbing it off like in the directions
it seems to even out my skin without drying it out
which is what i ususally get out of clay masks
the directions say to let it dry until it you can rub it off with your fingertips
i love that i don't have to mix it with water like a lot of other clay masks
i do rub it off
don't try to rub it off after it is done drying
i am not a fan of clay masks as the ones i used made my skin itch
it didn't seem to completely pull out blackheads in one try
i would not want to rub the dried clay off my face
just wash it off with water
definately recommend it for people with oily skin
seem to finish quicker which i think is in part to this cleanser
didn't dry out my skin at all
i did feel like this product cleared my skin.
does a great job with my dry skin
especially in the winter- doesn't dry out skin
you apply the product on dry skin
didn't dry out my skin
its supposed to go on dry skin
if the pimples come back we can try washing twice a day
i can never seem to get rid of them for long even when i attack them with acne cleansers
my skin breaks out more
although it doesn't dry my skin
this hasn't dried it out at all
even if you have dry skin
takes like 6-7 pumps to get enough product out
yes, it burns but it is so worth it!
i've tried so many different products that just dried out my skin without getting rid of the problem
i don't like the pump either as it seems to get clogged easily
it's weird getting used to using it since you put it on dry like lotion then wash it off
i didn't have any issues with it over drying my skin
i can say with absolute confidence that this is the best cleanser out there for oily
every time i wash my face with this stuff
you can reallly feel that glycolic acid putting in work
i exfoliate a couple times a week because this product does feel like it leaves a bit of a residue
i do not wet my face
it does not irritate my skin
it does have an oily feeling when you rinse it off
if you apply to dry skin
you give the medication time to be absorbed into your skin
i apply it to dry skin
otherwise it won't sink in
does not dry my skin.
made sure to get lots of sleep
oil generally dry me out
i tend to need extra moisture
my issues have always been with dry skin on my face
in the winter i put a little bit of coconut oil on afterwards
it also does not dry out my dry areas
as it does not foam up or leave my skin feeling tight or "squeaky clean"
if you're tingling or burning
will get very dry/flakey if i use it regularly
i apply on dry skin free of make up
then i apply this on dry skin
just this takes the cake for someone with acne prone oily dry skin
make sure you apply to dry skin though
left me without the big crusty spots that most other treatments typically do
i love that you put it on dry skin
does not dry out my skin at all whatsoever
it's not worth the $48 if it won't absorb into the skin
it doesn't sting or burn my skin
so, yes, it does work for dry skin as well!
it doesn't really dry me out
i notice as i'm washing it off
it didn't irritate my skin at all
it didn't dry out my combo skin
warning: it does burn a little if the pimples are open
also fall in love with your skin again :
use it dry or it doesn't work.
t's important to use products that don't dry out my skin
have to wash my face again to make sure
what sold me was of course the salesperson he insisted i would never use another face wash astringent again since it's all built in
i can go outside without makeup on not worrying about my shiny acne prone skin
at first it did dry out my skin a little
after continue use it no longer dries my face out
this summer my job involves sweating around a lot of pollution
was nervous i would get something that dried or irritated my face
almost nothing comes off when i use toner now
i don't get that too-dry feeling or angry red patches
then dry out my skin
it has the potential to dry out your skin
realized i was applying it too thick
it burns if i have open skin, but not too bad.
it might sting a little if you have breaks in the skin
nearly does not dry my skin
would pretty much put up with any smell or temporary tingling/burning if it cleared my skin
yeah it burns for maybe 3 seconds
put this baby on the parts of my face i know are most prone to breakouts
rinse my face in the morning with some cool water
i also dont have dry flaky skin with this product
it hasn't had a drying effect on my skin either
letting it sink in a few minutes before applying anything it works perfectly
seems to refresh my skin when i apply
can be a little drying
i like to use a moisturizer over it after i have let it sink into my skin for 5-10 minutes
if a breakout occurs all i need is a dab of this
this serum will help dry it out so you can apply makeup on top of it if you need to cover it
you have to be very careful if you plan on sun bathing for a while
it doesn't dry me out at all
not as instructed two times per day--it has not dried my skin out either which is very surprising seeing as it is 2% salicylic acid
it dries up the pimple by the next day it is either gone or almost gone
doesn't dry skin out3
it still won't dry out my skin
i can only use it once a day or my face gets really tender
price means nothing when it comes down to your skin
even then it was too harsh such as retin-a or accutane
it doesn't overly dry out my face
i like how my skin tingles when i apply this.
it doesn't dry out my skin, i'm hooked.
it has dried out my skin a little bit
it's definitely worth it if my skin is clearing up
i get pimples on my chin that would usually take days if not weeks to clear up
at the same time does not irritate or dry my skin
very dry in winter
does not dry out my skin
it doesn't dry sticky like some grocery-store products
truly does work if your problem areas are your lower face due to stress or hormones
it doesn't dry me out too much
this really does work without over drying.
doesn't dry my skin out at all
my skin doesn't get gunky or have the crusty appearance that some topicals can have
or whenever i wash my face
is okay to put out this dull skin
i also use the new philosophy take my breath away spf 30 as part of my skin care routine
it really has helped make my skin softer i just hope it doesn't affect my large pores
hard to find a good daily exfoliator that doesn't dry your skin or make it feel oily
one the days that i don't use this face wash
now that i use the exfoliating wash every other day the break outs have been much better
she let me know that too much exfoliating was could irritate/dry out my skin
i find that if i follow this with a toner
oh & it doesn't burn your eyes!!!
i started using clear days ahead dayly cleanser which it kinda dry my skin a little bit
after all that i use oil on my skin
ive never had an exfoliant do its job without causing my skin to turn red
i can feel an instant change right after washing my face with this product
i typically use it once i start feeling my face getting rough
it doesn't do anything for the deeper blackheads
i still have a ton of those leftover after washing
it does a great job exfoliating without irritating or drying too much
i just wish it came in a smaller size since i don't use an exfoliating product too often
tough enough to get rid of the dead skin
gentle enough where my face doesn't feel raw
it's not like a regular scrub
it can be drying
even though i know that fragrances are typically irritating for most people's skin
this is my favorite face wash because its gentle
doesn't leave a dry tight face
doesn't dry my skin
works well with my skin, does not dry it out.
i love using this every night because it really works hard at getting all the dirt out without being too rough on my skin
once you rinse it off it doesn't leave a trace of the smell on your face
there aren't bad chemicals in it either
my skin does not get super dry or anything
i might get one to get out major blackheads if i have them
the smell doesn't last long after you've rubbed the beads in
the beads are kind of rough when you rub them in
with the idea that perhaps i just needed to exfoliate more to clear my pores
i only really exfoliated like 2-3 times a week before that
did not dry my skin out
find that i suffer from dry skin frequently i also have combination skin
great for those of you with oily skin!
it's gentle enough to use everyday yet tough enough to get into your pores
doesn't dry out my face
it really is gentle enough for daily use
if you find yourself struggling with winter skin
also you only need to use a dime size amount for your whole face which is great because it lathers so well
it doesn't irritate my skin at all
i like to use it at night because it does cause a little bit peeling
i don't think that this face wash would remove larger milia or any bumps near the eye as it is probably too strong to be used in the eye area
it sort of foams up just a bit
once you wash it away
it really gets rid of all the grit on my face
not have to ever worry about it drying out my skin
because it is an exfoliating wash it helps get rid of the dry skin that started to build up in the cold weather
none of the products dry me out
it has a fine grit to it that didn't upset my sensitive skin or irritate it
i only can use every other day or it drys my skin to much
i noticed after about a week or so of using it that my moisturizer glides on so much easier
clear for my exfoliating wash until i felt as though it was drying out my skin
i like that the wash is gentle enough for regular use
i didn't want to dry out my skin by using the clarisonic twice a day
tip: if you have acne prone skin i definitely recommend adding a drop or 2 of tea tree oil in every time you use this cleanser
y bits are very tiny so they don't dig up your skin or scrape off your skin
this also doesn't make my skin more oily.
gentle enough to use everyday.
when i get facials they always comment on how clean my skin is
t doesn't feel so wax like
dry it feels as you put it on
i do not like other products that i have tried that leave a filmy residue
tried it out on my neck first because i have very oily skin
i can get by with applying powder once
acne in my t-zone without drying out the rest of my face
t doesn't come off on your pillow
creams that i use soak into my skin more thoroughly so that they work better than they did before i began using this product
i noticed that the next day my skin was way less oily
with this stuff no oil sheets today
i feel like this stuff has even prevented that yucky dry skin on/around my nose that always occurs from too much nose blowing
i can really feel it "feeding" my skin.
it does help sun damage
very smooth and never get sticky.
i've come to a point where i don't need to wear foundation or powder at all
i first did the oily skin one for the summertime
now i am doing the one for dry skin
i would recommend getting the one for very dry skin
for people that need the extra moisture
rely on the one for oily combination skin for the right amount of hydration at night
which means i can get dry patches on my t-zone
most anti-again products cause my skin to get red
it's in a tube so they won't lose effectiveness from air exposure
it's not too dry for my eye area
please sephora start carrying "very dry to dry"!
i do find that sometimes it doesn't work as well in the drier winter months though
i used strong bha so my skin is pretty dry back then
it is not greasy
not greasy at all
yet my face feels like it has gotten a sufficient amount of moisture
this moisturizer is just the thing when you feel like your skin needs some help
it also hydrates my oily skin without making it feel or look greasy or more oily
as it is not greasy at all
my nose is not dry or flakey when i use this.
much better than the jar products that you have to dip your finger into
found in the winter it wasn't enough moisture
it does make my skin *look* beautiful when i wake up now
you can use it all over your face and under eye.
i wish i'd gotten the more dry version for my winter skin
not greasy and goes on lightly.
when my face is still wet
my skin is not dry anymore
really bad dry oily skin
i live in a really cold weather region
tend to get dry skin especially on my face in winter
my face isn't an oil slick when i wake up
not greasy at all
without making it oily
i would rather not dig into a jar
soaks in well and does not feel heavy.
doesn't leave any greasy residue behind
even though i tend toward oily combination skin
in the winter my skin is a bit dryer than normal.
i reccomend this product over the repairwear line because the ingredients are not exposed to air before i squeeze it onto my fingers to apply
my skin tends to be oily in the t-zone
my skin tends to be a little dry over the wintertime especially around my cheeks
i tend to have oily skin
it is not heavy on your face
i also use a little dramatically diff oil-free lotion to make it spread a little easier
it also seems to make any marks from leftover zits seem better somehow
it never feels oily or heavy on my skin.
never feels dry or too oily
sometimes after application i feel a light burning
never feels oily or sticky
too heavy for oily areas
after 12 hours i can still feel the moisture
i needed a good nighttime moisturizer especially since my skin has been so dry during the winter [i have combination skin]
it doesn't get very oily
it gets slightly dry in the winter if i don't moisturize properly
this does burn my face when i apply it
the moisture online never did
most other products would leave dry patches
in the winter i use the normal to dry
in the summer i use the normal to oily
managed to avoid too much winter drying--even in colorado
this doesn't as long as i let it soak in.
it is somewhat thick without being at all greasy
for winter i use the combo/dry
i got this in dry/combinaison
i find i do not need very much to moisturize my face
bought the dry/combo because of the 102 degree weather where i am which usually makes my skin a tad bit oilier that normal
strong enough to protect your skin from long sun exposure
does not make my face oily at all
i only need to use a dab for my whole face
during the day be sure to wear sunscreen over it because it has no sun protection
sometimes the consistency or finish of a ptr product that may work for me is just not working in that area aka leaving me looking shiny due to my pretty oily
even a bit heavy even if i only used a tiny amount
does not like "dry" up as you try to take your time gently patting around like some treatments do
i also love how it can be layered- a serum underneath if you want
even though i have dry to super-dry skin i won't use #3 because it has mineral oil
althouth sometimes i'll put it under my hiaj for dry/sensitive at night if i feel i need it
this works well for those with dry skin!~
product, i usually stick with it forever.
although i do find myself rotating through serums
haven't had an issue with caking as i only use a half-pump
this one is a little drying for me
it won't pump out
though you do have to use a decent amount for really cold/dry days
it doesn't make my face feel stiff like some of the temporary un-wrinkle/decrease products can
my skin used to be dry
it is not as oily as it use to be
i love this for my oily skin because it doesn't make my face more shiny
it did leave some of my dryer areas a bit tight feeling
i love that my face doesn't feel like a grease ball
sticky with this stuff
saying that it's not for oily skin
trying to find a face lotion that did not contain oil
at the same time had all the ingredients to nourish my skin was hard
i would recommend it to everyone who has problems with oily skin
i work in a field where we sweat a lot
making it perfect if i need to layer a treatment on top of it
my skin tends to still look really oily around midday
wouldn't purchase unless you had truly oily skin.
it's not as good in the winter when i need something a little more hydrating
i can actually feel it firming
it's meant for people with oilier skin who live in humid climates
throughout the day my skin does not oil up
great at balancing out the oily spots without over drying the other areas of my face
i don't like using it during the winter months because i don't feel like it's heavy enough to prevent or get rid of my dry patches
there wasnt that oïl coming to the surface after applying the cream
i suggest it to anyone who has a oily
i won't be oily all day
really moisturizes it rather than sitting on your skin
tend to pat it into my skin instead of rubbing it in
does help keep my skin from becoming too oily
i love everything about this moisturizer except that it dries out my skin if i use it too much
it definitely keeps oil to a minimum as i hardly have to blot on the days that i use this product
just watch out for that dryness
it has a very light sort of acidic feeling when you put it on
bear in mind that you have to apply primer/foundation/bbcream right after the lotion so that it does not appear caked on your skin
a real oil control lotion that i could not find elsewhere
not oily to the touch
super oily in some parts
super dry in others
my face is not as oily as it used to be.
you don't have to use a lot because it moisturizes fairly well
guess i can deal with it since it's a great moisturizer for people with oily skin
it does not makes face oily at all
it also does not dry it up
sometimes if i feel like i need a little extra moisture at night i will add a drop of josie's argan oil with a pump of this
it gets oily throughout the day
no longer get greasy throughout the day
the pump is excellent however during the winter months this wasn't moisturizing enough even with oil added to it
once i realized that not moisturizing might be making the oil worse
because this is a little on the pricey side for something i slather on twice a day
if you don't mind spending the money it's definitely worth it for oily complexions
normally my skin gets slick about two hours after i wash my face
my t-zone gets extremely oily while the rest of my skin kinda just stays there
it moisturizes in all the right places while keeping other areas from becoming too oily
which is wonderful because then i don't have to worry about a moisturizer breaking down my foundation throughout the day
it is very hard to find a moisturizer that doesn't make me break out
i usually wear spf foundations or use extra spf if i will be spending a lot of time outdoors
apply the serum over any extra dry areas
i do feel like it leaves my skin a little on the dryer side
totally dried out my skin in winter
it's the only moisturizer that doesn't turn me into an oily mess
my face is super oily, especially my t-zone.
i believe that it's helping my skin become less oily overall
i look oily but deep down i need moisture!
still gives me the hydration i need without being too heavy for daytime use
does seem to keep surface oil at bay
this is a great product to wear at night for extra moisture or after a day in the sun to replenish your skin
more easier to be oily
because some would be to greasy through out the day then some would not be enough to moisturize the dry patches around my nose
everything that i've tried has been too greasy
terribly oily in places and very dry in others.
i may still blot once a day just out of habit
i tend to have oily skin
which tends to get oily
so that i do not have to put a sunscreen on top
if i need a lil extra moisture
can get dry around my mouth for ex
the only issue i have is that my cheeks need a little extra love because of my combination skin
it's not too dry and not too oily.
i would wash my face at say
notice that my skin was really oily
i would have to blot my face to remove excess oil on my t-zone every few hours
i would get even more oily
i no longer have to worry about having oily skin
even when it is really humid outside
i only need to use a small amount of the lotion on my face to smooth out my skin
i doesn't feel oily during the day
this product was able to control the oil without drying my skin
well i have combination oily/dry skin
i switched to this from philosophy hope in a jar because i thought it made my slightly oily skin a little greasy
i can't begin to say how happy i am to have finally found a moisturizer for my combination skin
i find myself using more because it seems to dry pretty quickly on my skin
incredibly oily in other areas
i literally can't wait to wash my face
can put my thick
calm my irritate skin like nothing else.
a little goes a long way -- no need to slather it on
i switch to a lighter night cream during the summer months because it is a little too rich for hot humid weather
the cream may be too heavy for the summer unless you have very dry
this is not too oily
when i apply it on my skin it looks absolutely normal
this cream doesn't make me break out
you really don't need a lot to be fully moisturized
never too early for that anti-aging stuff
its not greasy and doesn't make me break out.
it's thick but not heavy and is easily absorbed.
not too oily as i have combination skin
when you are tired
never oily or greasy
i guess applying too much may cause break-outs because our skin cannot absorb that much nutrition
this might be too oily for my skin
but it is not for oily skin.
i think this cream it's for very dry skin.
it does clean my face properly
will not recommend to use it at morning as it makes skin incredibly dry
i do get oily in my t zone
it helps keep blemishes under control when they do appear
doesn't dry my skin out at all
which is usually rare considering i already have naturally dry skin
however during the winter months my skin does get really dry
this product dried out my face a lot
or when my face is extremely oily
it you have oily skin all the time
i've pretty much tried every skin care product targeted at oily
it even takes off waterproof make up.
it will clear up your skin so fast!
it'll help clear up blemishes
2x if i have an oily/sweaty day
doesn't dry out your skin
it doesn't dry me out
it doesn't foam as well as i'd like it to
easy to clean if off
this doesn't dry out my already very dry areas
love the foaming because gets into all areas of your face
have to be careful to use appropriate moisturizer on the rare occasion it dries me out
it doesn't dry out my skin
i found it was very drying
there is no residue left on the skin
it can be a tad on the drying side
yes it can dry out your face a bit
i still use it now everyday just to keep the acne away
it is also not harsh at all like a lot of other acne washes
if this dries me out a lot
it does a bang up job of removing all the oils
this cleanser is great as it clean my face very well without irritation or drying it out
if your face is drying out because of it
it was slightly drying but wasn't unbearable.
i still get pimples but not as much as i used to.
doesn't dry out my face
then i use clinique tonic which makes sure practically all my makeup is gone
so far i haven't had an issue with this drying my skin
it's clearing up my skin well
it doesn't dry out your skin
it doesn't dry out my skin like other ance washes used to
your skin will get dry
didn't dry my skin out
doesn't dry out my skin
takes a little time to clear acne when you first start using it
most of the anti acne foam i have tried before this one felt like they were stripping my face
my skin feel nice once i'm done easy to rinse as we'll the smell of the foam is not that pleasant however like most clinique products
doesn't dry out my skin and i love it!
it doesn't dry my skin out.
my other treatment would sometimes curl up when used with some items in my routine
always apply sunscreen above if you decide to leave the house with it on because it will dry up your skin
i find that this doesn't work if you set it atop a fully present acne flare up
it really does a good job at keeping pimples from getting worse
i read a while back that these types of products work better after you have moisturized
it definitely doesn't dry out my skin or irritate it which is a plus
whatever else is in the actual lotion do a great job of calming my skin
this product does not trigger any flushing or hotness whatsoever
even if that happens you just moisturize more
i didn't find it overly drying which was so great
this stuff shrinks them down/gets rid of them overnight
it works very well, is not irritating or drying.
it isn't an "emergency" treatment in the sense that i makes things disappear overnight
it does not irritate or dry out my skin
you can't see where you've applied it nor does it elicit a big red spot on your skin due to irritation
i do not have a problem with my skin drying out
as it does dry out your face
works overnight and did not irritate my skin.
especially if the skin is broken
it does it over a period of 2-3 days depending on whether it's a full on whitehead or a raw patch of skin
i didn't have any peeling
i tried this out trusting the clinique name to deliver a 5% benzoyl peroxide product that won't irritate my skin too much
but it's more drying than my other go-to.
it didn't break out my sensitive skin!
benzoyl peroxide can be hella drying if you're not careful
use as advised, and enjoy your clear skin!
my skin is either dry or oily depending on the weather/season in alaska
it doesnt sting or burn like some other products.
to keep from drying out too much
it does not dry my skin
worth the price if you want to dry out any pimple
don't use it in places where you don't have a blemish otherwise it will irritate your skin
you only need a little dab
it did't really dry my skin out too bad
it is pretty drying
this is the only product that doesn't irritate or dry my skin
nor does it dry out my normal skin
does not over dry my skin
i really like this because it dries to a very smooth finish that's perfect under makeup
it doesn't dry out my skin
i also does not dry the skin the way other products do
i don't have to worry for that particular spot to peel off
doesn't dry out the area
i can't use this if my face gets too oily
it would break out my skin and itch like crazy.
she really like this over the gel one too.
gets rid of break outs asap without over drying skin
typically it doesn't cause dryness for me
started to use it as all of the part of my face that typically breaks out in stead of my toner
there's no need to dry out the rest of your face
it did not dry out my skin
it does not dry out my skin
does a fair job of keeping zits from getting huge if i catch them early
this stuff does an excellent job of treating the pimple without drying my skin out
especially if you have more mature skin yet still battle zits from time to time
the product does dry me out a little in the winter
that if you use it too often it may cause some overly dry skin
does not cause dry flakiness like the store-bought br
it isn't too drying or harsh on my skin
this product is spot-on if you need to take care of occasional skin issues
because it doesn't seem to dry my face out when i use it like a lot of acne creams do
it did dry out my skin
you should use sparingly to avoid drying out
it does not dry out your skin
doesn't dry out my face too.
i would recommend this as well if you have oily skin since it gives you a nice matte look
i went from overly oily to normal
clear skin overnight it seems like
it's lightened them up so much that i finally feel comfortable going out in public without makeup
i would beware if you already have issues with dry skin
it really does make your old scars disappear
doesn't make my skin oily or dry
that is my fault for not wearing enough sunscreen
this product will make you burn in the sun if not worn with sunscreen
personally with my skin complexion i never sun burn except for my face
if you struggle from scars you should wear sunscreen because the sun will increase the darkness of the scaring
make sure to get rid of your acne before using it
they're light enough that powder covers them.
my skin did get a little dried out in the area i was using this product
didn't irritate my face
doesn't leave any gross residue behind
it does dry my skin out a bit
it's no problem as long as you stick to a good lotion
an associate told me that there's an ingredient in this gel that can make you sensitive to the sun
i only use it at night because it is sticky
it has not given me one pimple or break out.
texture is going away already
it's actually hard to find a product that has so many of the skin lighteners in it
i would recommend this method because when i did apply on with my finger it actually peeled my skin
but doesn't clog up the rest of my face.
this gel makes your skin really sensitive to sunlight so make sure you put sunscreen on if you wear it during the day
otherwise it will cause skin to dry
i can't use it in the day because all the stuff i have to pile on from skin care to make up
to the point that i was wearing tons of concealer even when i wasn't breaking out
not the rest of my skin
my skin has been getting dry patches due to weather
while this gel did provide some lightening
the two products together made my skin burn
it often works as a peel for very severe
it's hard to use it in the summer because the rest of my skin is getting tan
you have to let it dry before putting a lotion on top of it too
maybe you should buy it after summer so your face can get tan
even you go through lazer treatment you'll need to use a sun screen afterwards too
you should definitely beware of the sun
use a strong spf before you go out
it really does suck since i'm light skinned
dark spots quickly go back to normal if you forget to use it for a few days
it is not a strong smell so when you apply a moisturizer or whatever you will use after the smell goes away
not even chemical peels at the salon could even come close to the results i got
not as oily throughout the day
make sure you keep up your sunscreen during the day- this will make you more photosensitive
getting dirty would usually break me out really bad
these do not leave him oily or doesn't make his dry skin worse
one of the bad thing about this product is that it makes your skin extra sensitive to sun exposure
one good thing is that it makes your skin look really hydrated when you wake up
the only downside is that they have been drying out his skin
does not dry out my skin
there is no greasy look either.
loves the pads cause of the tingly effect on his face so he uses them over other acne pads i have purchased
this thing is perfect for cleaning out excess oil from face at night
i find that these pads keep my skin clear.
they leave your skin fresh
great for individuals with oily skin like mine
they stay moist to the very last one.
doesn't make it oily
he has a very oily face
one of these pads really makes your face refreshed
for i think it will dry out your skin
these pads are very easy to use for my lazy husb
cotton pads was too much so this takes a step away
i love the smell of the pads my face feels so alive after i use the toner pads i will keep using these toner pads for the rest of my life
they clear up my skin
does not over dry
they are so moist down to the last pad.
you can see all the dirt
these astrigent pads are really nice.
smooth-never too dry
this is also the first toner i've used where it doesn't leave my skin dry after using it
doesn't dry out his skin.
my skin is also less oily at the end of day.
my skin is never dry when i wake up
t doesn't feel like it's rubbing off on your pillow
i usually apply another cream after this one.
light enough not to be messy
i love that despite packing a punch with the glycolic that my skin is not irritated at all
t does not a job as far as refining your skin
this cream does make it sting oh so very slightly when i first apply it
it wont sit heavy on your skin
i actually really like that it absorbs completely overnight
i don't wake up with greasy skin--which i find happens with thicker creams
'm sure the heat
dry air doesn't help
when you spread it on your face it feels weightless
i don't wake up with oiliness like i have with other products
no greasy feel to this cream.
i need moisture but not a heavy feeling.
t doesn't dry out or break out in the winter time
not too thick or greasy in my opinion
it lasts a while but can quick add up.
make my skin break out worse or clear it up by stripping my skin off my face
drying it out too much
fullly moisterizes without being greasy.
i will continue to use it to even out my skin tone--whenever i break out i scar really easily
it is not greasy
i felt like i needed to applications of this product to get enough moisture
then again my skin is very dry
i don't have any dark spots needing treatment
my skin is more radiant than i can ever remember it feeling in winter
it doesnt leave oil on my skin
i don't feel like i get enough moisture from these
the cream did not make my skin look worse
this give just the right amount of moisture
my skin is a mess!
this is the first night cream i have used that does not make my skin break out
so extra moisture is always welcome
it is really thick so even though i try to use it sparingly
it goes on creamy but doesn't make me break out.
can get my next jar
it goes on more greasy??
i don't break out or get a rash
it is not greasy
it doesn't leave my skin oily or make me break out
i need all the moisture i can get
does notfeel greasy at all
i find this creme to totally absorb into my face
i like the bar of soap because you really get quite a bit of product for your money
my skin isn't dry or irritated even using it daily
i personally like this better then the cleansing foam
if you stick with just the soap in your routine you will not do any exfoliating
clean my face it doesn't seem to be melting
only down side is that my skin had that residue feeling you get with soap bars
i wouldn't even consider searching for another face wash
still use it as a body wash today
it doesn't dry my skin out at all
doesn't dry me out either.
a little drying but that's to be expected.
then use my toner right afterwards
there is no dirt left on my face unlike most other cleansers i've used
get get overly dry when treating it
however it did dry my skin out significantly
it doesn't leave a film or residue
perhaps that's because i use a clarisonic brush to clean my face
it does tend to dry my already dry skin
i think it does a good job at keeping my acne down on non-pms days
it doesn't dry my skin out
it can wash that off
it felt gentle on my skin without drying it out too much
i would recommend buying the soap instead of the foam because it lasts longer
you can rub it on your face right before showering
it comes with its soap bar dish so you don't have to worry about finding a place to put it in
i find it too drying for the face
you can feel it dry out your skin right away in a good way
t doesn't dry of out my skin
doesn't make skin very dry
its a great product that doesn't dry out my skin or irritate it
whether it was a spot treatment or a scrub or anything
it does tend to be a bit drying
i can still use this salicylic acid on my face
the bar soap is definitely the way to go since you get so much more bang for your buck than the foam
now i only break out occasionally when i'm not eating right or super stressed out
it can be drying
i did like how squeaky clean it left my skin
which means you can apply perfume afterwards
if used on conjunction with your clarisonic your skin will feel so smooth
it lathers so much better
i worried that this was expensive for just soap
it does not over dry my sensitive skin.
lasts long time unless you are using head to toe
i won't go back to the foam
this one won't irritate your skin
doesn't dry my skin out
i can see how unscented is better to please the masses
it really works on acne if you give it a few showers
there is no oiliness to it what so ever
it is not drying either
it comes in a great water proof plastic case for the shower/bath so the bar doesn't get wet
shower as i normally would
it will make you skin feel dry
be careful around your delicate parts with this
obviously it doesn't do miracles because it doesn't clear up blackheads or acne that isn't on the surface of your skin
did not irritate my skin at all
s that does not irritate my sensitive skin nor dry it out
not tight or dry
this is pretty drying
it also dried out my skin a lot
i wouldn't use it everyday just because its so drying
now i just wash my face
i don't use this on my face because it leaves that feeling that most bar soaps do
it is a bit drying though
it definitely doesn't dry my skin out
it doesn't dry my skin out
it does dry out my skin
it will last longer than those bottled face washes
i love that this product doesn't dry out my skin
not only has it dried my face
it's too drying for face
doesn't dry out around my eyes either.
it's not too drying when used on the body
can be too drying for the face if used everyday
oily skin for as long as i can remember
although i haven't used this face wash enough to give it a solid 5 stars
or making my skin worse
this does not dry my skin out either
i am prone to breakouts if i do not cleanse thoroughly
it does not strip your skin
it will dry it out after once your done using it so moisturize after
it also has not dried me out too much.
has cleaned up my skin quite a bit
i find this quite drying
so far it had already tackled my problem of excess oil without drying my skin out
i don't need anything heavy like i did with other oil fighting cleansers
doesn't over dry even in harsh new engl
does not dry it out at all
oily skin depending on the time of year
this face wash has yet to dry out my face
this seems to help without over drying out my skin
doesn't irritate my skin or leave it dry.
fresh when i use it
yet not dry at all which is amazing for someone with dry skin as well
most of them would irritate my skin
it gets rid of the exta oil on my skin
its gentle enough to use twice a day without irritation
other face cleansers would just be too harsh on my face
or cause it to be super oily
only down side is that it dries it a little bit
great for combination skin feels very clean without over drying also have had less breakouts love boscia products
i've always had trouble with cleansers because they would dry my skin out or they wouldn't help me with my breakouts
this cleanser doesn't make my face really red after i use it
i must say my skin is sensitve
it does not leave any residue
every summer my face breaks out horribly because of weather
another plus is that you can use it with the clarisonic face brush
gave your skin a good clean while not stripping it at the same time
it doesn't dry my skin or make it feel oily half way through the day
your dead skin cells just fall off without scrubbing hard = great for me
only as an addition to your usual cleanser a few times a week if you have skin like mine
i don't break out nearly as often as before i used this cleanser
i will say the one drawback is it can dry your skin if you tend to wash more than one time a day with it
this stuff is amazing will be in rotation between the charcoal wash the ptr anti aging
does not dry out my skin
except for the fact that i'm still totally breaking out even though i'm washing 2x daily
it does not dry out my skin.
this doesn't dry out my skin at all.
summer- a little oil with dry areas
the treatment is like a gel that i only use in areas that aren't super dry
boscia keeps my face pretty clear although i still get occasional break out
this product cleared her face in 3 day's with no burning or drying
i generally use a lot of soap to get my cakey make up off
this one doesn't dry out my face as others do.
is not drying or irritating at all
only one pump is needed because it foams up a lot which is nice
it made my dry-normal skin that rarely breaks out
not too oily or drying.
i also like that it's not drying.
it can dry my skin out
plus it doesn't dry out his skin
no over-drying or irritation at all.
it doesnt dry out your face
which is already pretty dry
it doesn't leave any residue behind
and it does help keep blemishes away!
i switched to a cheaper face wash only to find that my pores were getting really clogged
a little more dry than oily
you only need a small amount for a rich lightweight lather
removes make-up without too much scrubbing you should definitly purchase this one
it is such a treat to wash my face now
so everything either causes me to break out or dry out
doesn't dry out my skin
i've tried almost every cleanser out there that claims to help clear your complexion
doesn't dry out my already dry skin
it doesn't dry out your skin
a little pump is sufficient for your whole face
the imperfections i do get heal much more quickly
t doesn't irritate your skin
normally my face gets super oily after about 1 hour of washing it with my usual cleanser
isn't drying in the least
it leaves no residue on my skin while still getting it nice
especially in the shower
whether they be exfoliating or for breakout prone skin like mine
without over-drying or irritating my face
add that i'm either extra oily or extra dry
it doesn't "combat" any skin problems i have so much in that it cleans my skin without drying or leaving an oily film
t has not dried out my face its actually fresh
it also tends to be dry after washing my face
will break out from any kind of irritation
it really seems to keep my skin in check
really liked it because it did not sting or burn or cause any irritation on my sensitive skin
as a bonus it is not drying on my combo
t doesn't irritate my skin
doesn't dry out my skin like most products do as i also have sensitive skin
avoid greasy food, not touch my face, etc.
anytime i notice my skin starting to get irritated or feel a pimple/zit/whatever i pump out the smallest possible amount of product
even when i'm lazy with washing my face or when i should have horrible hormonal breakouts this stuff will either stop it or make it very minuscule
this doesn't irritate my skin at all
i always do a ton of research on skin care products before purchasing because i have oily-yet-very-sensitive skin
especially because the majority of the dryness occurs around my mouth as well
it keeps my acne away without drying out my already dry
once in the am once in the pm along with the boscia clear complexion cleanser- i have very oily skin
they control my oily skin
this stuff is not drying at all
less oily from day one
has not dried my skin out at all
doesn't leave my skin oily or greasy
it hasn't dried my skin out either
doesn't irritate my skin all all
doesn't leave any kind of sticky residue
i love that this line doesn't irritate my skin or cause it to flake at all
i like this because it helps with the little bumps from dry skin
love how it doesnt make my face feel greasy when i already have oily skin
my teens are somewhat fickle when it comes to their skin care needs
because it effectively keeps your skin clear.
ive got a discard pile of about everything you can imagine: murad
i definitely wouldn't recommend this if you have major acne or extremely oily skin
it also seems to make me a bit less oily.
i do like that it doesn't dry out my skin.
it doesnt dry out my skin.
once the weather turns colder
many of the things i tried before would dry out my skin
it might work well for occasional breakouts or if you want to maintain a clear complexion if it is already clear otherwise use the willow bark
i've tried so many that either dry my skin out or make it worse
doesn't dry me out
it doesn't dry out your skin either.
now i use a little bit of the night moisturizer on the areas that feel dry
therefor most clear complexion treatments realy dry my skin out
i love it because it doesn't over dry my skin.
they just stay under my skin instead of surfacing
also more acne because your skin starts producing more oils to balance things out
then wash it off with lukewarm water
this is the only cleanser that i've found actually makes my face feel cool
what i love about this is that it doesn’t leave your skin feeling tight or dry
when i have breakouts i always use this because it is so soothing
does not dry it out
this does not irritate or dry out my skin
doesn't irritate my skin at all
you need to use it on dry skin
doesn't make it oilier than normal
it doesn't burn or irritate it
realized that it should be applied to dry skin
this product doesn't irritate my skin at all
it does literally melt makeup away without being harsh on my dry skin
i feel like i'm going through the bottle fast
it doesn't dry out my skin.
i wish it cleaned more thoroughly
have to wash twice sometimes
it is very soothing, does not irritate at all.
still dry out my skin
this was surprising to me since this cleanser does not strip the oils away from my face
i don't have dry
although this cleanser does a pretty good job of minimizing redness right after you use it
this will give you a smooth clean with no irritation
and also remember to use tepid water, not hot.
don't expect this to foam
good thing i only need it in the cold weather months
it doesn't leave my skin tight or dry afterwards
it doesn't strip my skin at all
it doesn't foam, you have to remove it.
so many products bother my skin
which might feel greasy to some people
had come to the point where i could not use blush any longer because i had enough redness already on my cheeks
got so tired of trying other cleansers that made my skin feel tight
does help even out the skin tone
even plain water can dry my face out.
does not leave that waxy film that other 'gentle' cleansers seem to leave
this is the only face wash that isn't burning my skin to use
it cleans my sensitive skin better than any other product i've tried
does not dry my skin
i don't know whether it actually helps with redness because i use the cinique face cream
it is not at all greasy
or were so lightweight that they didn't moisturize well enough
when you apply too much it can peel
this cream, while thick, does the job right.
it doesn't irritate my skin or break me out
not sure if it calms my skin or if it's just my skin calms after a wash with cool water
i usually get this around the corners of my mouth because of the cold weather around me
after using this product i noticed my dryness almost completely disappeared i rarely ever have a rosacea flare up one thing that it took me a while to realize is that you should still use a daily moisturizer if you have dry skin
helps my skin tolerate retinol which pretty much every skin expert says you should use
whenever i got sensitive skin from facial treatment or simply from season change
even in my good skin day i like to use it
think they should make a day cream with spf.
it no longer feels tight from being to dry nor turns into an oil slick after its applied
that being said though i do only use it at night because it does take a while for it to really seep into your skin
i put this stuff on after i wash
most of their products work great on my oily
i will put it on on days where i exposed myself to a little too much sun or when i see a bit more redness than usual
it does calm quickly
it doesn't make it worse or aggravate my skin
not too oily or greasy
never greasy or oily
taking one star away for the jar packaging – i would much prefer a squeeze tube
now it is very dry
have tried dozens of different lotions to use as the weather becomes more colder
this lotion does all prevent it from all of those things
it has not made my skin too oily or greasy.
it's worth trying if you have reddish
not only did it look unsightly
my skin does get red
i'd prefer if it was in a different package like a tube where the cream isn't as exposed
it is so sensitive that i have yet to find a face wash that keeps my skin from breaking out
i discovered upon moving to the frozen north that cold weather is also very drying
this was never a problem in southern humidity
however certain spots dry out when the humidity is low
because of how sensitive my skin is i totally messed it up using different creams thinking i needed to treat the acne
as i actually needed to calm my skin
to make it more difficult, i abhor thick creams.
to the point where i can wear a light powder foundation
this cream together i do not have any flare ups
it isnt greasy or heavy
everything left my skin dry
at the very least you will probably find this cream soothing
it can cover better because my skin isn't as red
the texture does not seem too thick to me
before redness solutions it just looked like makeup trying to hide evidence of all the other junk
it's my go-to for dry skin relief!
it has a cooling effect that feels sooo good when i put it on while my skin is in a "flare up"
it also prevents skin from getting too dry or flakey
its cool to your face
just using a little bit is enough to keep your face moisturized for 24 hrs at least
i think i will use this along with the moisture surge intense cream
every facial set i have used has always dried out my skin
none would take away the real dry patches
my face no longer has any dry patches
maybe now i can get rid of the greasy bobbi brown products
i could feel the burn when i first applied this restoring serum
which means that it was getting rid of all the impurities under the eye
the serum does not leave any greasy film
all you need is one small squirt for both eyes so the bottle will last you a long time
you don't have to put a costly moisturizer over it either
this doesn't irritate my skin at all
you can still use your own favorite primer over this serum
i read some reviews about it being sticky
is not greasy at all
it is not greasy
this is the only night cream that give her enough comfort
enough moisture even for my oily-comp skin type
i normally use josie maran's face oil
got too much sun until age 20
doesn't irritate your skin at all
i love putting this mask on when your skin is not looking so hot
i do use a charcoal mask after to get at blackheads it hasn't done much for
whenever my skin is super dry
this mask is perfect if you're looking to correct blemishes fast
this is a super quick fix for when my skin feels clogged
not drying at all
first i must say i have very oily skin
the product is quite sticky
thought it would have a greasy residue
when i wash it off
it easier spread on my skin
the fact that it dried
not so much where it was hard to rinse off
i like to add a little bit of warm water
really rub/pat it into my skin one last time
did not experience the dryness i normally do after most masks
it is amazing at removing any texture without hurting the skin
i feel like i'm "resetting" my skin when i use this
no burning of tingling which i usually take to mean it's working
i also love how it makes my skin better soak up any other skin care products that i use
pros:-made my skin feel/look super clean after rinsing off-smells nice-small amount of product
whenever my skin is misbehaving i first grab this mask
which is usually dry
not too dried out
i always use a moisturizer after this mask to make sure i don't let my skin get too dry
possibly causing more breakouts whereas this one has fruit acids that will "eat up" the dry skin
not dry or tight
it helps to even out my skin
didn't burn at all
after washing it off the dry peely skin i can never scrub off was gone
afterward apply a nourishing cream which works so much better after this mask
it felt a little dry after i rinsed it off
can use this peel again
it does tingle when you are using it
without microbeads as those always seem to cause me to break out
rule of thumb for usage is: 1/2 a scoop or less if your skin is sensitive
not only was the air pollution at a all time high for my skin
felt as though it would be great for me because of the fruit extract acids
you definitely need to use a face cloth or towel to wipe it off
my face gets significantly more oily throughout the day
once i'm done with this first jar i'll only use it on my body occasionally
as a matter of fact it tingles a little which leads me to believe it has more drying effect
which is fantastic because most products have a bunch of chemicals that aren't good for you or your skin
the only draw back is that it's a powder so you have to mix it with whatever your using as a base
this powder appealed to me because i can simple scoop some out
after using this they just don't surface
the powder can sometimes be hard to get out of the scooper
the first few times you use it your skin will probably tingle a little
it seemed like i used quite a bit more of my moisturizer then mixing them together
not only does it block harmful rays that will jump start ageing
i get compliments on my skin all the time.
my face is not oily all day and shiny.
only down side is that it stings if i put it on after i've exfoliated
it's very versatileits very hard to find products that get rid of spots on dark skin
my advice-take them with a grain of salt.
when you blend them together
i now make a little pile of moisturizer with a well in the middle
i've found that my skin gets used to it over time
i seriously have not even used the powder past the neck of the bottle yet
my guess is i haven't been spreading my sunscreen high enough for years
i mix this stuff into my face oil or sunscreen or even primer
it doesn't irritate my skin except for a bit of tingling immediately after i apply it
it also makes me feel confident that i'm protecting my skin from the damaging effects of the sun if any rays get through my sunscreen
i decided for future uses only to use half a spoon because it seemed to make the already thick moisturizer even thicker
just be sure to blend it in your palm prior to applying it
it kind of dryed out my skin
within minutes of mixing it with my favorite moisturizer my skin seemed to come alive
this is a huge plus as i have very oily skin
the only downside is that sometime i find it will make my glycolic serum peel to much
now i can just add this powder
i like mixing with when hope is not enough serum
it seems like a tiny little tube when you get it
it does not irritate my skin
i still had dry skin
what i love most about it is the texture it's like a whipped gel that isn't too heavy for the under eye area
the consistency is not too thick which i like
basically getting no sleep
i wanted to make sure this wasn't going to make my eyes water like some under eye creams do
i then dip my small beauty blender in a little bit of this product
i did not have any issues with this product drying out my under eye area or not being moisturizing enough
dark enough that i feel like i want a lightening product
so because i already spent the money i kept using it just to moisturize
t is not very oily
maybe too "moisturizing" as it leaves my under eyes feeling oily no matter how little i use
/or wrinkles under your eyes this may not be enough for you or you may want to use it in conjunction with a denser cream
it does not take much due to the soft texture.
it is not oily at all
so not too greasy for me
cannot tell if it actually whitened anything
does not sting or burn sensitive eye area.
being honest--if you have any sort of dryness whether it's just around your nose or your entire face
for those of you who have oily skin
nd usually the moistures makes my face more oily
doesn't cause my face to dry out or be even more oily
not totally grease my face up
would reccomend for oily skin 5/5!
love it for my combo skin so that my forehead doesn't get too greasy
i do find it a little drying on my cheeks that tend to be drier
really wouldn't recommend it to people with dry skin
it doesn't make me feel greasy at all
you can feel your skin absorb the product
if you are still suffering from dry winter skin you need this asap
this did not provide enough moisture for my liking
sometimes i feel like i need a stronger one when my skin is really dry
where my t-zone gets fairly oily throughout the day
i used it in winter when my skin was extremely dry
just keep getting the small tubes which i find more sanitary vs sticking my fingers in a jar
sometimes i still want a heavier moisturizer on at night even though i have combination skin
it is thick enough that you can feel it working on dry skin
it dries fast so you can go in with your makeup routine after application
i am almost 39 with dry combo skin.
absolute moisture once you put this on.
this stuff has just changed my face especially with the dry winter
it does leave my oily spots a little oily
it works wonders on the dry areas of my face
it definitely gives me the moisture i need
doesn't leave you feeling heavy or oily
become oily/dry combination in winter
this does not break me out or make my pores feel clogged or my acne feel suffocated
if i go a few days without using it my skin gets dry
my skin was not dry anymore
i've always had a hard time falling in love with a different moisturizer because it never felt like it truly sunk into my skin or actually helped the dry issue until i found this little piece of heaven
since zero part of my face is oily i was a bit nervous to try
i generally hate moisturizers because they take days to absorb
flaky patches of skin that i get every winter so that my foundation makeup won't cling onto dry patches of skin
t is not sticky whatsoever
it absorbs really quickly so you can use it day
i will say that if you are extremely dry maybe it will not be your favorite because it is more of a thinner consistency than a really heavy moisturizer
it was not sticky
tend to stay away from creams or gels of any kind because even lightweight ones that absorb fast still tend to be greasy
usually on the drier side
yet not to greasy in summer
it didn't make my skin feel or look oily throughout the day
my skin stays soft all day without getting greasy or oily
i feel like if you were to have dry skin there is a formula for dry skin only
a little usually goes a long way unless i'm extra dry
it leaves a non-greasy finish which is something that is m
i would definitely recommend the intense if u have extremely dry skin
i do think this would be good for normal to dry skin though
downs of winter weather in texas makes it hard for my skin to adjust
it's also great to use before apply makeup since it dries really quickly without leaving a residue
in the colder months my face is extremely dry
this product has been able to get rid of the dry patches
keeps me matte through the day without drying me out :
i've never had to worry about it being too greasy for me
the more oily spots are not oily
i tend to always cater to my oily spots
it gives me a lot of moisture
this feels like a cooling gel when i put it on
it doesn't make my skin feel oily
so my skin does still get dry patches in the winter
i've yet to find any moisturizer that's even half as good
on days when my skin is on the oily side
it really helps with the dry patches
it worked well in the very cold/dry climate
was light enough for hot
i would recommend the heavier version if you like in the cold
i no longer have to wear my hair down to hide the dryness
oily parts of my face dont shine
i love that it's more of a gel consistency instead of cream because i'm more oily
if you feel as if your current moisturizer is not cutting it
my skin is more drier in the colder months
i found this on to be less greasy
rich so good if you have dry skin
making me oily in spots
my face loved every bit as it just melted in my skin
it goes into the skin so effortlessly without it feeling too thick
it goes on rather thick
my nose will still get oil when it's humid
even when my makeup should be melting off in hot weather
it does not sting or burn me at all
not going to shell out that kind of cash for a face cream
so only use this cream on the "normal" areas
it was not enough for my very dry skin
i almost feel like i am not quite as oily as i was before starting this moisturizer
also my dry spots are not as bad
it does not leave my skin looking greasy
it doesn't feel sticky either
i am that kind that easily get really oily
i feel like i could burn through this
now my skin is normal and sometimes dry.
provides the right amount of moisture without making me oily throughout the day
won't get the rest of my face too greasy
my skin is still very oily by the time i get home from work
forehead tend to be where i get oily
have been trying everything in my power to find a moisturizer that makes my face glow
becomes oily/normal when it gets warmer
i went without a moisturizer before because everything would leave my skin irritated
it does tingle when i put in on
though i use it sparingly on my chin where i tend to get most breakouts
it balances out my skin very well- i am not even super oily at the end of the day which is basically unheard of
at first i thought that that particular product made my normally oily t-zone super clean
i love that- i've always had to use an oil absorbing powder
usually complains when i wear them because they are too strong for his sensitive nose
we have naturally dry skin
also not greasy one bit
once or twice a week when my skin feels extra thirsty
oily right now in the summer
once you apply it to your face it feels smooth
you get a bit of a tingle when you apply it
get loads of compliments on my skin when i use this product
this oil free treatment does wonders for my skin
if you don't have dry skin
best of all it is not greasy.
i wanted a night cream that does something to my skin while i sleep instead of just sitting on the surface
prior to using perricone i was having trouble with oily skin
i think my pores do seem smaller
not greasy at all
i can even feel the softness when i wake up.
as someone will a very oily t-zone
i also love that this cream is not greasy.
not too thick or greasy.
doesn't make my sometimes oily skin break out
isn't harsh or drying
not ideal for something i keep in the shower
i don't feel any film on my face after washing.
i find when i wear heavy make up
the only time i have to go back over is when i use something like urban decay's liquid liner
this is the only thing that i wash my face with
soft wash that wont irritate or damage your skin
two pump for my taste will do
never harsh or drying!
perricone face washes are the only ones i use now
this or the citrus face wash are the only ones that take off make up without stripping my skin off
this is the only toner i've ever used that makes my skin any different
it is a simple cleanser that keeps my often problematic skin clear
does not irritate or over-dry my sensitive skin
does not dry out or irritate my skin
i want anti-aging at every layer of my skin routine
finally something that doesn't severely dry my skin
does not over dry as long as the water is cool to cold
i don't use it twice daily only because i'm afraid of over drying or it breaking out my skin
i loved it better when they still have skin clear cleanser which is milkier
this one tends to dry my skin too much.
it takes a very small amount from the pump to clean your face
while i do like this cleanser after washing my face i didnt feel much moisture compare to fresh so thats the reason for the switch
my poor sore nose didn't burn when i used the cleanser
my skin was dull, flakey, break outs, etc.
does not irritate my skin in the least
if it gets in my mouth it doesn't taste that bad
if this face wash could be just as sensitive on the eyes it would be the best face wash of all times
leaves your skin the way it should
it does not dry out my skin
love this no-stripping or too-tight feeling cleanser
realize that may bias me against cleaners that are either foamy
it doesn't dry my skin out to the extent that
it doesn't dry me out
a little too tight of a feeling so would recommend as a cleanser during warmer months
my face will feel tight if it’s not moisturized at least twice a day
it does not over dry my skin.
does not burn my eyes when i wash my face
doesn't dry it out or leave it tight
you only need one small pump of it to clean your whole face
i don't have clarisonic brush
i would say this cleanser is not for someone with dry skin
that doesn't stay on your skin after a shower
once you get past that it does the job of cleaning the skin without stripping it down harshly
i like the fact it is in a pump bottle.
it has spf in there so you can skip tthe mess-up-your-eyes-with-sunscreen step
even the ones supposed to stay creaseless for 24h
it does not feel dry around the eyes
you can feel it absorb into your skin immediately without any oily residue to interfere with your makeup
i guess i have a lot of fat on my lids.
it is not heavy or greasy.
i don't mind the slight tingling because the skin will get used to
apply the cream a bit further from the lash lines because your skin naturally 'pulls the moisture in' from the spot where you apply it
if the cream is applied too close to the lid of course it will get inside the eyes
for some reason it causes my eyes to water
occasionally does burn slightly.
it does sting my skin a little at frist.
if i use to much it feels greasy
i don't usually spend this much on eye cream
it doesn't feel tight or dry
'd recommend people with really oily skin use this
like it can breath after using
then i started getting dry patches
despite all this i really do like this cleanser so now i only use it twice a week or when my skin needs that extra deep cleanse
it's just a basic wash good for oily skin like mine
doesn't dry your skin
it does not irritate the skin.
dry after using this
sometimes a little too dry
usually a scent that i would like would irritate my face anyway
it doesn't dry my skin out at all
only thing i wish is more foamy.
it does feel a bit dry
does not dry out my skin
neither drying nor oil producing it does a good job of cleansing
i noticed that during the middle of the day my skin would get oilier
doesn't dry you out.
not tight or dry
the shower can be slippery
it doesn't irritate or dry my skin
it doesn't over dry my skin
it's as if the "dullness" gets washed away a little every day
most other products leave my oily skin dry
although i will switch back to the gentle cleanser if i find it again
it is a quick wash, very fresh.
does not leves you dry
you only have to use a tiny bit because it is so foamy
this cleanser did just the right amount of stripping away dirt
since i burn really easy
it does not dry your skin and lathers well.
this wash smells much better than the other wash that i was using by this company
it is a little pricey for face wash
this works well and doesn't make your face oily.
it does clean my skin well without drying
great for people with combination skin that need a little moisture on the cheeks or other drier places
good product.. does not over dry my skin.
it is very concentrated too- half of a pump is more than enough for a lightly sudsing face cleansing
does not leave skin tight or dry.
it doesn't dry the skin or leave it too oily.
if you find it makes your eye area dry or itchy
it might not be the best/only moisturizer you would use if you live in a region with cold/dry winters
even if i had to skip eating out
i never wake up with an oily face as with other products
it really does peel off the years
another plus to the product is that you can see through the brown glass
you'll take a hammer to it just to get out any precious tiny remaining bits you can
if you apply it over cold plasma
1/2 pump will do your neck
fading dark spots takes way longer than a month even the kind of treatments that you can get from a salon
don't waste any product in a cotton ball
it feels like it is removing even more dirt
i always see something on the cotton pad.
just about every other toner i've ever tried dries out
left it too dry
making it more oily
i look less oily
after recently discovering my skin type is normal / more on the dry side
it was making me even more oily
the gel lasts me longer though
fresh without being too dries out after using
it doesn not do a good job of make up removal so you definitely need to remove funny before washing with this cleanser
it didn't dry me out much which is good since i'm prone to dry skin
does not make me feel too dry and cleanses well.
dry skin that gets oily throughout the day
it can be difficult to find cleansers that don't make me break/dry out
my skin is typically dry
doesn't make me red after washing
i've had no issue with my skin getting dry
so foams during the winter really dry out my skin
in the summer it can be slightly oily
in the colder months can be slightly dry
it leaves my skin tight immediately after i removed it with water
i decided to get this because i had always just used a cheap face wash from the drugstore
it does make your skin a little tight immediately after use
not veering too dry or too oily
i do get a little dry around my nose during the winter
it doesn't require a lot of product to get your skin clean
dried out my skin terribly
this is the first cleanser i can remember using that doesn't leave me feeling dry
im not sure if this is irritating my acne or the "fresh" rose deep hydration cream i love the oranges smell it cleans well too
i absolutely love this product because it cleans without drying out my skin
it also does not irritate my skin.
the foam of the product makes you feel like you are cleaning your face
while this really does the trick without drying out the skin
i've noticed though that if i just use half a pump it still cleanses fully
i wouldn't recommend this for dry skin--it will dry you out more
when you really need water instead of the sahara desert
everything recommended for my skin has been so drying
this is the best fash wash i've had in a long time
i'll be dammed if it didn't clear up my acne as a bonus
not for getting deep cleansing done like i prefer at night
if i don't apply my moisturizer within 10 min my skin may feel dry
doesn't dry out my very dry skin
when used with my clarisonic it does not foam up my face
one thing though--it dries my face afterwards
doesn't dry my skin out
it has also done wonders to reduce how oily my skin gets
i might switch since i do wake up a little greasy
i might try another product for the pores with ole henriksen
doesn't dry my skin at all
i know cleanser isn't really on long enough to to be considered a treatment
doesn't dry out my skin
especially for summer when my skin gets more oily
not at all drying on my skin
my t-zone is prone to be oily
you can get a lot out of 1 or 2 pumps so the product lasts a long time
it's not as drying as you would think for a flaming cleanser
i mean heavy it comes off with one wash
it works great with a spin brush if you have
i never find myself having to "scrub" my face.
it dries my face out if i use twice a day
it really is the best thing i ever tried for my dry skin in a dry climate
retin a can be quite drying while your skin gets used to it
does not get whipped away by pillow or blanket
or cold wind in winter
like a time machine for your skin
i've tried everything on the market in attempt to hydrate my constantly dry
my skin is not in bad shape at all before using it
i like the fact that it's in a pump so there's no contamination with h
because i have super dry skin
absorbs so quickly that i thought it wouldn't work on my dry
my skin has been really dry this winter
the formula absorbs so quickly that the first few uses i was worried it wasn't enough for my dry skin
i do get oily in some spots
this has helped the dry without aggravating the oil
i used this product all throughout the hot az summer too without any issues
no matter what kind of lotion i use my cheeks get very red
with other lotions i would have to reapply throughout the day to get rid of the flakiness
i don't fee this makes me oily during the day
this is a lightweight cream which may work for my skin during the summer
as long as you don't have very oil skin to begin with
my face is very dry in the winter
does not feel greasy or gooey
at night i use this with one of the oils for more moister
my skin has been so dry this winter
also on particularly windy or dry
chilly days i feel my skin needs more moisture than what this cream offers
this moisture day cream delivers what it claim to do
this actually puts some moisture into your skin people
i will start by saying that it is way better than my last moisturizer it's lightweight absorbs fast
this moisturizer won't make my face oily like others have done on my already oily face
the winter weather caused a major skin sos for me
not greasy, perfect for daytime.
this cream mosturizes my skin so nicely that it has actually repaired the broken skin
i keep coming back to it when i need a moisture overhaul or have stressed out skin
needed more moisture when the weather changed
the true test will be in the winter to see if it is moisturizing enough for my dry skin
is lightweight enough not to leave me oily at all
not too oily at all.
this product provides just the right amount of moisture without that greasy
no too oily for my combo skin
then you will love this face cream
'm always on the lookout for something that will not make my skin feel like it's not having moisture sucked out of it
for dry skin, this is the best i have tried!
i wanted to get something organic since everything you put on your body is absorbed through your skin
not like you just chopped up a bunch of veggies
doesn't leave skin feeling sticky the way some moisture lotions can
its for someone who has dry skin or for someone who needs more moisture in their skin
not at all oily
once you blend it out it does absorb quickly
keep in mind that it is a cream
it is not super oily or heavy
i would not say this is intensive moisture.
only thing is that it can make the skin a bit too oily/shiny
doesn't have a greasy/oily feeling
super moisturising without making my combination skin break out
considering how my skin will break out into dry patches within a few hours if i don't use something moisturizing enough
i find that if i rub a small amount in my h
it will not make me oily
usually my t-zone does get super oily
probably not the best for oily skin types.
never feels oily or dry like it use to with other products
i rarely see my dry skin now
good for the cold winter
would definitely encourage anyone with oily skin to use it
vacuum packed so you get every last bit
not do not have very oily skin
even in this dry weather
certainly recommended for those with not very oily skin
i told the sales clerk that i needed a moisturizer that works well for combination skin cause i am oily in the t-zone
i get very dry skin in the winter
he has oily skin and doesn't have a problem.
i just use it a little sparingly
not too heavy and not too light.
my only concern is that i am not sure it is moisturizing enough for me
now i need to get the foaming face wash!
too bad my skin had to act up with this product
very dry on the rest of my face
this product helped me balance the moisture needed on my face
however, it does fill kind of thick.
i think the consistency is far too creamy for day use
it does not leave your skin with a matte finish
i looked far too oily
'd rather have a little too much moisture
although i am almost 50 i still have oily/combination skin
if it is really warm i go with boscia's oil free day lotion
a++ if you live in dry
didn't leave a greasy feel or residue
this product is a little too thick for me
not too thin- just right for normal skin type
my skin breaks out very easily
thick just used too much
during the summer it can be a little heavy as it is pretty thick
it calms down dry irritated skin like i've never had any products do before
i’m going to save this sample to use in the winter when my skin is painfully dry
in my 20's it was too oily
i agree with a previous review that is does make my skin feel a little sweaty after use
my face is normally super dry
now i can wear my makeup without looking like a month old donut that's been sitting in the sun
dry patches away while not aggravating my aggressively oily tzone
just be warned it is a very thick cream
might not be the best for someone with oily skin
i found even with dry skin if i use it to many days in a row my skin feels a little on the oily side
doesn't burn when i'm applying it
first i thought this cream was too thick
what i don't like is the packaging as i prefer tubes or pots nor do i like the fact that this moisturizer sits on my skin for 5 minutes before absorbing in
just enough moisture for my dry/sensitive skin before applying makeup
no matter how irritated my skin i can use evercalm global protection day cream without stinging or further irritation
it didn't feel heavy or greasy.
i mix it with my a drop or two of argan oil
it didn't make me oily at all either which is a huge plus
i no longer have any dry patches of skin on my face
i get really dry in the winter with the cold air
my makeup cakes less in this area when i use it
doesn't leave an oily film
does not leave skin oily at all
it does leave a little oil on my face.
along it does take a while to rub in
doesn't make the skin break out
i don't always feel like wearing my bb cream just for sun protection
letting it soak into my skin with time
enough to not irritate my skin
it does leave my skin a little bit greasy
i do experience a lot of dry patches on my face during cold/dry weather
it doesn't make me more oily in the typically oily areas either
i normally have drier skin
not leave my skin all sticky
it is very creamy but not heavy by any means.
i would say it is great for oily or dry skin types
hot for a little bit so before putting makeup on i suggest a mattifying primer
i tend to have dry
my dry skin problem is gone completely since using this cream
sometimes at night too if my skin isn't feeling too dry
i started using this winter to soothe my dry
i do find in the summer that it is a bit too thick
can cause my sweat to collect in certain areas
it hydrates my skin- not too much or too less
worth it if you have sensitive skin
my skin can sometimes be oily
sometimes if other parts of me are extra dry
it does not irritate my skin
i don't have dry skin like others have mentioned
it doesnt feel greasy or oily after applying
needed a good moisturizer to take care of it without breaking me out
it does feel dry on occassion
how can this be a protection day cream if it doesn't protect from the sun??
finding an intense moisturizer that doesn't irritate or clog my skin has been really tough
for fall/winter it does me well
like it can still breath
it is also oily
this was the only cream that my skin actually fully absorbed
that was able to moisturize it as opposed to just laying on top of it
giving just the right amount of moisture without irritaion
i get the sensation that my skin is soaking up miracle ingredients that work to calm it down
or sensitive skin that can also have some redness then give this a shot b/c it's a wonderful product all around the board
sometimes dry patches on your face like me
not a heavy cream or greasy
it is so hard to find a daytime moisturizer that gives enough hydration so that the spots aren't dry
doesn't also leave me greasy
it doesn't cause me to break out nor does it clog my pores
doesn't leave leave me oily
however people with oily skin could probably get away with it
nothing had ever actually been able to leave me without an oily or even too dry finish
my face gets oily throughout the day if i use any other kind of facial moisturizer
without drying out the other parts of my face
i've had a lot of issues trying to find the right night cream for my face since it is oily at the t-zone
really dry the rest of my face
you must try this it is non oily
not a extremely hydrating mask to where you can actually wear it every night
i never have anymore dry spots because of this
i usually don't wear moisturizer because it makes me feel oily afterwards or after a couple uses
it certainly did not have a shiny or greasy finish at all
but not matte either.
also am a bit oily here
help to make my skin less oily without drying me out
things often don't absorb easily into my skin
my skin is more dry than oily
though if you live in a humid climate it might not be enough
the resurfacing aha concentrate were not too stingy on me
a moisturizer that doesn't leave me with dry flaky skin in some areas
it does not feel oily or greasy
not too mattifying though
the areas that i get oily i get really oily
now that it's a bit warmer i continued using this
touch up my powder as much as i used to
this product has taken that oily shine away
i can't use most primers because they break me out or they are so dry after application my mineral makeup won't stick
i find myself using blotting papers much less often
with this i can last a good 5 hours without looking like someone splattered oil on my face
it does keep my oiliness in check
stuff either made me oily or it gave me a rash
this product makes my skin feel incredible without clogging my skin or making it feel oily
an hour later you are looking fresh out thedisco shiny or it sried you out so bad you feel super tight
does not leave skinfeeling oily
finally a moisturizer that doesn't feel like i'm just making my t-zone shinier
i started using this in the summer when my t-zone gets very oily
doesn't make my skin oily like other products i have used
not too thick you only have to use a little bit
there is enough to put a thick layer on your face
when you wash it off your face is glowing healthy
t doesn't dry your face out
after washing this stuff off
the little brush is a huge bonus as it makes applying the mask super-easy
smooth as you apply it
i love the way your skin 'cools' while the mask is on
then i need to follow with a cleanser to get the oily feeling off my face
it truly feels as though it gets down deep into my pores to really get the dirt
really helps keep my dry skin in good shape through the winter
you'll probably need a stronger chemical peel from time to time
by the time you wash it off
just because it says givenchymen on the tube
as any dry skin person knows
you can literally feel the difference on your face--my skin drinks this stuff up
having dry skin in the fall/winter
not for oily skin, as this really is quite rich.
so needless to say my skin was quite dehydrated the next day
not end up looking super oily
even knowing it was the reason i was super oily
now weather is warmer
at night it is the only thing i have tried that quenches my skin
depending how dry my skin is feeling
yes it has a familiar smell of fresh cut cucumbers which goes away after you apply it
my skin is now going from combination to a drier type as i age
probably won't be able to use this in the warm summer weather
i started using this cream during a particularly angry dry skin period
it can be a little oily once applied
will make your face seem a bit oily until it soaks in
my skin gets so dry in the mountain climate from fall through spring
it did not make my skin oilier as some have experienced
perhaps i just have very dry skin
it might be too heavy for someone with really oily skin
most people says that this is greasy
even with my mostly dry
my only complaint is that it doesn't sink in quickly enough to wear during the day/under make-up
avoid anything too heavy
" the fresh black tea mask does it better with those results lasting longer
you just can't go wrong with the fresh black tea line
my face has been especially dry this winter
i would not recommend this for someone with oily skin
this cream is very nice for the dry winter weather
may be a bit to heavy for summer unless your skin is very dry
one of the very few richer creams that i can use at night that doesn't run into my eyes
it does keep the moisture in your face to maintain
this provided good moisture throughout the night however it did make my face somewhat shiny
give you all the moisture your skin needs even in the deepest of winter
able to use very small amount because it goes on so creamy
it was more even, less oily, and less dry too!
dry in the winter
it does feel a bit oily
i wonder if it still works during the summer in a dry air-conditioned room
it's a bit heavier than some but absorbs easily.
this is a bit too much on the greasy/oily side for me to wear during the day
that is when i turn to this cream
i do like a sheen to be left behind after putting on my night moisturizer
this the fresh moisturizer doesnt seem to sink in like those do
so maybe if you have extremely parched skin
usually i get tired of creams because over time they don't work as well
did remedy some dry spots
the combination of dry weather
expect one tub should last me through the dry season
at first i was scared of something as thick as this bc i have oily skin which sporadically breaks out
it does not leave me oily in the morning at all!
i hate the fact that the cream is exposed to air
while it's fine for my dry skin
so the winter air is very dry
this one is so nice i often just tissue a bit off
f you use this before you put your makeup on it totally helps with a flawless look because it makes your skin so smooth
it is very cooling when you put it on
it doesn't need to dry.
what it does is calm your skin down
once you wash it off
soothing that i didn't want to wash it off
not greasy at all!
it doesn't make your skin dry nor greasy
if you happen to get a dry patch on your cheeks
it does leave my skin with a glow after use
the mask's texture isnt like anything i've ever tried before- its like a cream
my face is always so smooth as i leave it on as an overnight mask
so while during "regular" or cold weather this mask is normally unfavorable
if you live in a hot climate though this is refreshing for the skin
has the most calming cooling feeling even after i wash it off
makes your skin look like it does when you are using the beauty or soft focous filter on your camera
i wasn't in need of tightening or firming or age repair from sun damage
after i washed it off i could still feel the cooling sensation of my face
it also smells like something from my childhood that i cannot quite put my finger on
get this if you have flaky and dry skin!
hydrating products do the same thing for much less money
if i ever get dry skin
it goes on more like a cream
i rinsed the mask off after 20 minutes because i didn't know how my oily skin would react if i left it on
because i thought my skin was burning until i read that the mask is supposed to feel cooling
if you are a person who doesn't mind a cooling sensation on the face
i think this mask will make your skin smoother over time given that mine looked more supple after i took it off
be careful not to get too close to your eyes
i don't rinse it off i just let it absorb into my skin
this one softens skin better than any other mask i have used
t can just breathe
also, super easy to work with and wash off!
i normally have oily skin
it really works wonders if you have tired skin thats been over scrubbed or if you have slight wrinkles
once i rinse it off, my skin does feel softer.
overnight is too rich for me.
work for breakout and dry skin and all season!
i need to put on toner/serum immediately after risen-off as my skin started to feel dry
i will say it is a little drying afterwards
that doesn't bother me because this clears up my skin like no other cleanser i've used
use a small amount that's enough to cleanse my face
this does not dry my skin
my skin also gets dry in the winter
isn't drying at all.
for someone with sensitive dry skin like myself this is a great product to have on h
doesn't leave your face dry or tight
doesn't irritate skin at all
it did not dry my skin at all
doesn't make your skin feel dry or tight
(not sure about dry skin).
why i choose this product because it really cleans surface of my face quickly
it will be a little bite dry
unless you have extremely dry skin
doesn't dry out my skin
don't want to use any harsh soup for daily use or when i don't need extra scrubbing
wish it was made specifically for drier skin.
it doesnt leave my skin feeling dry or flakey which is something i always found problems with other cleansers i've tried
i like it better in the summer helps out with the oily skin
i found it a bit drying
you have the right amount to wash your entire face
when i follow it with my toner there's never even any dirt left behind
it cleans but does not dry.
wish they made a body wash like it!
the only downside about this cleanser is that it isnt very good at removing oil from your face
its good for sensitive skin because it does not dry out your skin like most cleansers do
not just wash my money away
dry skin products don't seem to get my skin "clean" enough
one pump is more than enough to cleanse face
its still more than enough to lather my face
it doesn't leave my skin dry or slimy.
the gel are the two things i let touch my face
in the summer it is a more oily of course
my face is not dried out after cleansing
just make sure your gentle with your eye area becuase of the super thin skin in that area
my skin does not feel tight after using this
if u have dry skin like me it can make u break out of excessive dryness
excellent cleaser.it is foamy but not dry.
it does not dry the skin
i like that it foams when you add water.
it gets your skin clean without drying it out
it stings a little if you accidentally get it into your eyes
not only does it thoroughly clean my skin
i live in an extremely cold dry climate
didn't immediately make my skin feel like moisturizer needed to be applied in the first 10 seconds of drying my face
could be a bit less drying
not dry out my skin
when you lather it up
i happen to have very dry skin
doesn't over dry my skin
it gets rid of all the dirt
in the winter it tends to get extremely dry
creme radiance is a product that i can use year round no matter if my skin is dry or oily
i did notice my skin is more dry
somehow doesn't leave skin oily
it does not dry out my skin like others say.
you can feel your skin has been cleaned well
gentle enough to not strip away of all moisture from your face
a bunch of other face wash
at night my skin is much less oily
i love how this goes from a cream to nice foam.
it is not drying
it doesnt stress your skin at all after the wash.
did apply anything after the wash for 15min
as well as dry the skin a bit if it's used morning
i think this would be a great cleanser for anyone with combination or oily skin
especially when the air isn't cold
it took some getting used to because i had gotten accustomed to cleansers that would make my skin feel "squeaky clean" right after washing
i started using the cleanser even when i hadn't worn make-up
until i found this cleanser there was not one that would not dry out my skin
a little hard to wash off
it isn't drying at all
you usually won't need to wash a second time unless you've really caked on :
no make up residue like other face wash products.
not so foamy but i love the clean i'm left with.
it does a great job doing it without drying my skin
it doesn't dry my skin.
not for dry skin
it didn't dry out or irritate my skin
foams up slightly so you can easily cover face
doesn't make my skin feel dry.
it is going to take me forever to finish this tube because every time i wash my face i use a very small amount
it doesn't burn or leave my skin feeling tight like many cleansers
actually evens out my skin type
when you wash it off your skin feels very tight
you need less than a dime size dollup as it foams up beautifully
this product is a cream that foams up when you add a little water
does not over dry my dryer spots
it actually feels like water on the face
after it's dried my face does feel a little bit tighter
doesn't feel dried out at all
it's not drying on the skin
does not leave any unwanted oily residue
i'd rather spend a little more to have clean skin
just want a quick cleanse instead of your entire regime
it says there is no rinsing needed
however i am finding that it is beginning to dry out my forehead
not dry or stressed after
ever...maybe even better than soap and water.
i liked it for cleansing in the morning when i didn't feel like doing a full cleanse
i do love this product to remove my make up not only because it isn`t rough like the majority of the good make up removers
it will prevent my skin from being oily
i do not have to rinse it off.
i still have a hard time taking off any waterproof make-up
it is not oily
if you want a make-up remover
if i don't have time for a full cleansing this works in a pinch
works on waterproof if you let the cotton disc sit on your eye like 5-10secs
this is a good fill-in cleanser for nights when you have little time to fully wash your face
out of all the products in my skin care routine
it feels like water going on your skin it refreshes me
i find that the better cleansed the skin is beforeh
needed a quick fix to gently remove makeup on those nights i was too tired or lazy to do a full cleansing
this stuff works wonders on my dry skin.
or as clean as you can without actually washing it
doesn't leave a film or your skin oily
not dried out either
it does not work well for eye cleansing
you can actually feel your skin breathe after you use it
it makes it feel fresher without the use of alcohol
not oily at all
leaves face oily for awhile
does not leave my skin looking oily
everytime i would do my makeup it would look cakey or flakey
wait a few minutes for the oil to absorb into my skin
not get oil everywhere
it doesn't seal on very tight
not to mention this is fantastic at controlling oily skin
tricks your skin into thinking it doesn't need to over produce oil
unlike most oils it doesn't feel heavy on your face or come off on your clothes or pillow
i've never even heard of using an oil on your skin for daily wear
i really do think it hydrates my face
would recommend for dry skin.
the skin around my lips would also often swell up even when i did not touch it
this is a dry oil
t doesnt leave your face looking oily/shiny
not have to worry about having an oily-look
i've always heard about different types of oils being used for the hair
it honestly does work for making your face dewy
it even reduced the look of my pores so much so that i feel comfortable going out with no makeup some days
great for dry or combination skin.
it does wonders for my dry skin
i find that my skin needs more moisture
their marula oil doesn't do anything for my skin
occasionally the bottoms of my hair to help with any split ends i may have
this oil makes my skin feel so hydrated for pretty much the whole day until it's time for me to wash again
at first i didn't like it because it made my skin too oily
though my thirsty hair will take a whole dropper full
let it air dry
this product gives me enough moisture
my skin doesn't feel dry, or stretching anymore.
this oil does wonders for your skin
it doesn't feel sticky at all.
i put it on my face too when it's dry in the winter
typically if you have very oily skin what's happening is your skin is lacking hydration
it's going to balance your skin out.
moisturazers often left my naturaly oily skin even more oily
i found the moisturazer for my oily
all of them either made me break out in pimples or had my skin red
/or caused my skin to become more oily
this oil helped to clear my skin so much
not dry out my already dry skin
this oil is also amazing when applied to damp or dry hair
it helps so much with my lips not drying out halfway through the day
love this face oil!
doesnt feel oily at all
very light not oily at all!
then i started using this along with simple cetaphil face wash for oily skin
i don't have oily skin anymore either.
this does not irritate my skin at all
i mix it into everything
this argan oil is seriously life changing for someone who has sensitive dry skin
it does not make my face look oily at all
my face is like an oily pan at the end of the day
works wonders for the skin even if you're oily
during the winter my skin is sooooo dry!
first oil i've use that did not clog my pores or make me break out
anywhere else i experience dryness
oil on the face can be scary
especially if you have oily skin to begin with
doesn't leave an oily mess.
i always reach for it when my face is extra sensitive has dry patches or even when i am breaking out
my hair usually gets very greasy when i put oil in it
through winter my hands and feet get very dry.
not only did it make my skin glow
i never got oily or horrible
all i've ever read is that argan oil should not be deodorized
it does take a really long time to absorb into my skin
haven't been able to find anything that can really lock in the moisture like this oil
wherever else my face becomes dry
my face rarely has dry patches anymore
i would 100% recommend this to anyone with dry skin
i would likely use the 100% argan oil during the winter time since it's heavier
not oily at all.
highly recommend if you have very dry skin
my skin was so dry it was peeling off in huge dry pieces
i really wanted to find something that would deeply moisturize my dry areas
my dry patches are no where to be found
it doesn't make you look greasy
not giving it enough moisture
i am not bothering no more with mosturizering creams
this product has salvaged my dry/irritated skin from the michigan weather
doesn't leave a greasy film over the face
i do get dry patches
i applied it to the really dry areas on my face
foundation doesn't look cakey or dry at all throughout the day
this is a must if you have dry skin!
i normally dont set my face with powder
sinks in to the skin so nicely it doesn't make you pile at all
also feared putting oil in my face would make my abundant blackheads
super dry everywhere else
my nose isn't an oil slick in an hour or two anymore
every night after washing my face i apply this oil wherever i have breakouts
it doesn't make me more oily
i let it sit for a whole then use a light moisturizer on top of it
this doesn't make my face any more oilier
feel like a lot of it has 2 do with how this oil makes my face so moisturized
elic acid or other aha peel to make sure my skin doesn't flake too badly
either it would not help with the dry patches on my face or it would help with the dry patches
my skin is rarely if ever dry
i never used to have dry skin problems until now.
if you feel weird about putting oil on your skin
it doesn't absorb right away
t does feel oily at first
i love that its helped get rid of my dry winter skin
like i've never had any dry flaky patches all of my face at all
i did add another cream on top when i needed extra moisture
this serum is literally like putting water on your face
which i loooooove while getting ready!
when out on it feels like your drenching ur face in water
but, my skin is so dry, all the lines in it show.
really dry in the winter
this still doesn't leave me greasy
it absorbs immediately and you need very little.
dry skin not so much.
has never pilled on my skin or affected my makeup application the way other products can
to try to help my very dry skin
i break out when it gets too dry
i switched from dermalogic hydrating booster to this one about 4 months ago as it locks in the moisture after washing my face am
i just couldn't seem to find a product that would provide enough moisture
my skin doesn't break out
i find that i need it more during the winter-months or just whenever my skin feels dry
i top it with an oil and drier days
it's very quick to absorb into the skin
dry as it did before using
doesn't leave my face greasy in the summer heat
it may feel drying when you put it on because it is soaked by the skin quickly
despite my dry skin i have found that a little of the viz goes a long way
do not get the tell-tale dry patches at the end of a long day
it's way above what the skin can absorb
my skin gets so dry in winter
it works great for my sensitive oily skin when it gets dry in winter
for awhile my skin was going through a dry spell
my skin isn't as dry anymore
i live in a warm hot climate
this is a must have for peeling dry skin.
this is perfect for combo skin that need moisture
especially for those living in colder climates where the weather robs your skin of moisture
if i don't apply moisturizer right after i wash my face it becomes tight
avoid having dry patches when i wear foundation in the fall
you only need one pump to cover your face
as i find it makes me a bit oily during the day
not greasy at all
gives my skin jus the right amount of moisture during the day
feel as if it is doing the job to lock moisture into my skin
it was so dry there
almost dry this winter
i also did not experience any breakouts nor the peeling effect you sometimes get when your skin is over moisturized
it really helps my skin through the drying winter weather
pat your face dry
then when its dry i put a little josie moran argan oil over it that i got at sephora too
this is an absolute must for anyone with dry dehydrated skin
the kind that when you get out of the shower
you can feel your skin really tightening up
which simply wouldn't stop flaking
it absorbs really fast and does not feel greasy.
another benefit is it seems to plump up your skin so you look younger
for some people the word acid might scare them
i love it because it feels like my skin is getting a drink of water
i would recommend it to anyone who is having hydrating or dry skin issues
have always heard how good hyaluronic acid is for your skin
this is the only that doesn't turn white on my face
i tend to have an oily chin
during summer my skin tends to be oily
for winter i switch to the dry skin version
does make my skin greasy though.
i like that it doesn't feel oily or heavy when applied on my face
my skin gets oily throughout the day
love this cream as it doesn't make my skin break out even with the spf in it
not heavy or greasy.
gives me just the right amount of moisture
was worried it wouldn't allow me to get a tan with the spf 25
i still get a great color without ever burning
my personal beauty adviser suggested it to me when i was complaining about the dull complexion of my skin so he told me about how i should try this moisturizer
that this formula actually targets dryer areas of your skin so when you put it on it can solve your dry spots
on hot sunny days when i don't want to have any products on my skin for fear of them melting off
becoming a hot mess this moisturizer is an easy way to get a little natural glow throughout the day too
not too oily or dry
the weather was really dry
this time my face didn't feel dry at all
a little oily when first applied so you have to let it absorb for a bit before applying makeup
does not add any extra oily or greasiness to my skin
good for cold weather.
however this cream don't feel oily
does not make me oily at all
if you accidentally get it into your eye
no pump or bottle that's hard to get the last of the product out
it is not too much for my oily skin
is in fact too much moisture
works well use it as my under eye cream too
i assumed that because my t-zone is oily
my t-zone may be oily
it gets dry in specific areas like my forehead
the oily skin type is for them
it's hard to find a moisturizer with higher spf that doesn't feel like you smeared grease on your face
although i have oily skin
the name of this produce scares me since i have oily skin
that if you have any problem areas of dryness
helps balance my face out moisture wise
my derm put me on some pretty harsh cream to help clear my face up
it still left dry patches which would then make my make-up flake off
in fact it's the best one i have ever used for my oily skin
i will test it in the winter months to see how well it moisturizes when my skin is a bit drier
i still found that it made my face a bit greasy
although my face still does get a bit greasy
i sweat easily which can cause a breakout if the moisturizer i use is too oily
it is not too greasy or heavy feeling
i really prefer a squeeze tube.
yet the sunblock part doesn't have that sticky oily feeling like many others do
my face doesn't feel greasy at the end of the day
have not had one single breakout or dry flake
it was not too oily or greasy
however due to all the stuff i use to treat my skin
it would be too thick for me
then in the winter i switch to the combination dry/oily to take care of the dry skin i get in the winter
25 is about right without feeling too heavy like the higher spf ones-this is packed with antioxidants
creamy product that doesn't make my face greasy or my eye make-up bleed
i find that the oily version of this moisturizer does the best job of providing moisture without feeling greasy
even those of us with oily skin
i usually don't break out with clinique products
not thick or greasy feeling
only to seriously break out or become way too oily
i live in a pretty dry climate
i don't feel oily at all when i use this
it doesn't cause me to break out as other moisturizers have
this stuff makes your skin feel so dewey
now that it's back to normal i use the combination oily to oily formula
not the best for oily skin
i did not give it 5 stars because it is a bit lacking in moisture
my skin is very dry around the t-zone
sometimes oily during the summer
after using clinique moisture surge i find this one does not work as well as the moisture surge for dry skin
i don't use clinique's dramatically different because it doesn't have sun screen
it gives plenty of moisture for my normal skin
it probably isn't for oily skin
i recommend it if you're on the dryer side of the spectrum
it still does wonders for dry skin
this has the right amount of moisture benefits without leaving me prone to breakouts
needed something that would quench my skin without making it feel heavy
although can be a little too greasy in the summer
my skin is kind of dry in places
this goes smooth without being greasy :
f you sweat or go swimming with it on it will run into your eyes
it does have a little sting feeling when i apply it
it didn't give me quite enough moisture for my parched cheeks
my cheeks felt like they could use another layer
i would not recommend this for anyone who has oily or combination skin because of the weight of it
this product is never greasy
i can use on my face that doesn't irritate my skin
whenever my face is really dry in the winter i use it almost everyday
when i have an occasional dry spell
not greasy at all
i guess many creams are too heavy.
not too thick when you put it on
it never feels heavy or oily
it definitely keeps me from burning when i'm out in the sun
i definitely feel protected from harsh winter winds
it is not greasy or sticky
it perks my skin right up
i love this as a base coat for the rest of my clinique make-up
it does the job for my very dry skin.
it leaves my skin ready for any make-up
i would recommend letting your skin dry for a few minutes before applying this moisturizer because the spf may give you a tingly sensation after you apply it
less oily feeling i think than the moisture surge
it you scent or skin sensitive this product will meat your daily moisture need
i would recommend this to anyone that has dry skin
leaves just enough moisture to feel like you've actually done something good for your skin
it gives me enough moisture
it isnt oily, which i like.
i don't need an additional lotion underneath even though my skin can be very dry in the winter
it also doesn't make my t zone greasy
i never burn when i wear this
this is the first moisturizer that i feel comfortable going out into the sun without worrying about sun damage
makes me feel better about the sunlight i know i get
does not leave me oily or greasy
not greasy at all
i struggled for a long time to find a moisturizer that put a stop to my flaking
so this is a good moisturizer for winter when my face is more dry than usual
be careful not to get this in your eyes or it will sting because of the spf
does leave skin a little shiny right after application
it has the spf you need without the greasy heavy feel
i never get burnt on my face with this moisturizer on
this is so worth it, not greasy at all, try it!!
does not leave your skip oily plus has already sunscreen so you do not have to worry about protecting from the sun
it's not rich enough for my dry skin during winter though
no longer have the dry patches
i don't need to worry about the sun since it has protection
no more dry skin in the winter
so i have oily, but pretty clear skin.
made me massively oily
does not strip my skin
almost like there's too much pressure in the bottle
cleanse well and does not dry out the skin.
it doesn't irritate my eyes if i keep them closed
my face is dry
not dry it out
it does not foam unless you use tons of the product
even though it is an oil cleaner
it doesn't leave my skin oily at all
i feel that it might be a little drying because i am literally "squeaky" clean afterward
it is non-drying for the dry skin that covers most of my face
still deeply cleansing for the areas that tend to break out
this product should not dry you out unless you are over doing your skin care regimen
you only need one pump and it lather up nicely.
it's the only thing that takes off every trace of make up with out stripping my face of its moisture
a friend gave me some of this jurlique balancing foaming cleanser to tide me over until i can get to sephora tomorrow
so my face gets washed perhaps a little more than other women's because i like to start with a totally clean face
i figured that since my skin is only a little oily in the t-zone
either normal or a little dry everywhere else i better go with the balancing cleanser
it usually does a good job of removing it
when it doesn't i just add a little more cleanser to my h
my skin does well with the mix
a little goes a long way- just one pump foams up
it's hard to find the right balance between something formulated for acne
something that isn't too light to prevent those stress
also very foamy so a little goes a long way.
i would recommend it to anyone with sever dry h
super oily everywhere else
rub them together to warm the cream up because it is so thick
after going through lots of expensive products to deal with my very dry skin
it can get dry in the cold
not so thick that i break out
also not so light that the dry areas of my skin feel like they don't have any moisture
is easy to get out of the tube
oily or tight anymore
it is still too heavy as a face cream for me
it keeps him from getting oily even after a long day in the florida humidity
your skin must be clean
it is quite thick and does not spread easily.
i stumbled upon suggested i use products for oily skin because my breakouts were clearly from too much oil production on my face
it may feel too thick when you first squeeze a pea amount out of the tube
once you warm it in btween your fingertips
your skin is drinking it all up
let your skin drink it in
it does not dry out even at the end of the day.
it feels so smooth that it's like i have mask on overnight
for so long bc i hated the greasy feeling of most of products for dry skin-type
it works best if you either warm it up on your fingers
get it if you have dry skin.
it's thick enough to only use a bit at a time to cover a whole surface
not so thick that you have trouble spreading it or whatnot
the extra cold winter made my combo
make my t-zone not as shiny
my skin gets extremely drying during winter
i held off a week before writing this review to make sure this didn't irritate my extremely sensitive skin
the little tube takes up very little precious real estate on my bathroom counter
i live in a very dry
even though i have dry skin
have dry skin at the same time
if your skin is dry its great
not oily at all
my face doesn't feel dry or tight all day
you only need 1 or 2 pea size balls for your face
it works great for winter months in houston when the humidity is almost non-existent
would not be so good during our humid months--too rich for that
mpressed that it wasn't oily or greasy
you can just see the glow instantly without the heavy greasy feel
if it fixes my face again
i think it definitely has the right amount of moisture
when sweat usually leaves my face super dry
usually further irritate my skin when it is in that condition
thought this would be too greasy
when it sets it is not greasy
i think this is a good investment for someone who occasionally gets dry
i like to use it on days where i don't feel like using a long process with toner
suggest it to anyone with dry skin in need of some luxury
actually dry in the t-zone
it does not burn irritated or chapped skin.
this moisturizer is so thick i can feel my face sucking it in
it is really hard to find a good eye cream without breaking the bank
your suppose to warm it up slightly with your fingers then pat
this winter i have been waking up to what i call "thirsty" eyes-- basically a horrible look
i think this might be the restorative drink my eyes need before bed :
it holds the same treasured quality: it is hydrating without being irritating
have not found any other cream that doesn't sting
not at all greasy
t is difficult for me to find a product that suits my skin type
it is not greasy at all
i do wish that the cream was a bit thicker
water until i rub them raw when i use eye cream
the other problem is that the first time you open it about a week's worth of cream spews out
you actually feel your skin tightening up around the eye
it really does have a mattifying affect on my combination skin type
it actually kept my face matte all day
my face is an absolute oily mess
normally when i apply moisturizer my face looks like a jar of vaseline within about ten minutes so to find a product like this is absolutely life changing
this does wonders for my oily/combination skin.
it does dry quickly on skin though.
finding something that'll actually keep me matte without turning me into an oily mess within an hour has been difficult
you struggle to control the shine on your face it will not matter how the moisturizer feels in your h
at the end of the day what matters is that your face stays matte
you just have to rub the product well in
let at least 10-15mins for the product to absorb into your skin
it's not over drying or anything.
my skin doesn't look greasy at the end of the day
i would highly recommend it to anyone with oily skin
i get extremely oily throughout the day
you have to apply it after you're oily
it doesn't break out my sensitive skin
this will be your final solution to oily skin
i am normally an oily person
fall where i am not quite my oiliest
it kept me from being a greasy mess.
if i skip this, my face will shine like the sun!
does not make my skin look or feel dry
after it dries it doesn't seem to provide much moisture
it tends to make me oily
before i added the murad oil-control mattifier to my routine i would get extremely oily within a few hours of using both the lm setting powder
because at least my skin isn't oily
my only contention would this product is that it smells like glue
it feels a little thick/heavy as i'm applying it
i didn't feel the need to powder or blot.
otherwise my face would be shiny
i always had problems with my skin being oily
this keeps me from being shiny all day without making my skin feel dry
i only apply this to the oily areas
throughout the work day i usually only have to use loose powder once to keep me matte
you get yourself some if you have oily skin.
now when i say matte i mean i'm not an oil spill.
i like that for me it doesnt make those areas look flat matte
beyond happy with how much this mattifies without drying
my foundation stays put without all of the other products except a blotting powder i use later in the day
worth it just to not have makeup always melting off
just try it if you have oily skin n feel like you can't use any moisturizer because it's just gonna be too greasy
i don't get nearly as oily during the day if i wear this under my foundation
i think my skin was maybe too dry
i apply it on my t-zone and it controls my oil.
it doesn't dry me out at all!
it can definitely help oily skin.
nothing is perfect though some days where i'm more oily it can still cause my makeup to run a little
everything that would help my oily nose
keeps my face from being super oily
we both have really oily skin
i would recommend this to any oily skin girls out there
a must for anyone with oily skin.
especially on my face so with the skin perfecting lotion i felt like i had to wash my face 3 times a day just to keep it under control
my makeup usually gets runny by mid afternoon because of my t zone
t can leave little white spots if you haven't massaged it into your skin well
although it does "control" my oily skin
it really controls my oils without making my face look dry
my "t" often gets oily very quickly while the rest of my skin dries very easily
it also helps keep my face moisturized while remaining oil-free for a much longer period of time
does not irritate my skin one bit
then as you rub it in it starts to melt into your face
i will say it is too mattifying even for my oily skin to use both night
i get really oily throughout the day
it sort of reminded me of elmer's glue.
rarely get oily skin
not heavy on your skin either.
amazing product if you have oily skin!
living in the hot tennessee summer is not easy with oily skin
tend to get really oily in my t zone
it does go on very thick
it does not dry out my skin
use it on my tzone only because is the only area of my face that is oily
mportant for people with oily skin to know that their skin needs moisture so this product is a great way to stay in their comfort zone
my skin stays matte all day long no questions asked
usually by the end of the day i feel like i have a layer of oil just sitting on my skin
i start to look oily i never feel like i have a ton of oil on my face
it is kind of a thicker cream more so than the kind of moisturizer for dry sky that's so thick
the reason why i took one star off is because it does make your skin a tad bit oily throughout the day
my skin would become insanely oily after only an hour
feel protected enough for the little bit of sun i get outside of work
even if they say "matte"
here's the deal though- i'd rather have oil than wrinkles
this product is less greasy
less oily than some other's i've tried
does a good job at making me look less like a grease ball
i love the extra spf in it
my skin is more oily in the summer
i get very dry
in the summer i get really oily
so when i see oil control
it is super moisturizing with out leaving you with that slick feel or look
which is great because most of the time i have to pile on you much moisturizer just to try to make it a couple of hours before my skin dries out
during the winter when i was extra dry i would sometimes put a different moisturizer on underneath this one
let it warm on your skin for a second then rub
i love this as a primer for my foundation- at first i didn't feel like it controlled my mega oily skin enough
wouldn't recommend it on bare skin b/c it'll get soaked up super fast
it does a great job keeping me from getting shiny during the day as well which is a huge plus if i'm not wearing make up or bb cream
you don't want to be stripping away all of your oils on your face
that one is definitely more drying
so many pros about this face wash.
this wash has kept my skin healthy during both extremes with a change only to the moisturizer i use
he too likes the wash
it is very drying though
this stuff will clean your face so hard it might actually sting afterwards
you only need a very small amount to cleanse your entire face
loved it so much i decided to try the foaming face wash
it doesn't dry the face
concentrated that i felt my pores are cleaned so well yet no breakout
one of my favorite cleansers because it gives your skin a cool feeling it leaves your skin feeling lifted where cleansers don't do much more than cleanse this one does something more
eyeliner don't love it cause it takes them off so easily
i don't have to "pre-wash" my face to get it all off
it doesn't dry me out either!
do not over dry the skin
doesn't feels too dry after it
not all dried out
however it can be drying.
so when i started a medicine that makes me sensitive to the sun
now if i have forgotten to wash the sunscreen off i may get a pimple or 2
i also use it with my clarisonic brush
it foams up really well so you don't have to use very much at all
not too much is needed as it lathers well.
how it doesn't strip your skin
read not dry-just clean
like others said i think it does leave skin very dry after cleansing
you only need very little to cleanse your face so the bottle lasts forever
i definitely need to follow up with a moisturizer with this one because it does dry out my skin a little
can see this tube lasting me a while
i usually get dry skin after washing
then it becomes oily throughout the day
i don't get dry skin afterwards
it doesn't strip anything or leave my skin tight or dry
it doesn't strip anything or leave my skin tight or dry
it doesn't strip anything or leave my skin tight or dry
it doesn't strip anything or leave my skin tight or dry
could not wait to get smother tube
you need just the tiniest little bit mixed w/ warm water to do the trick
it definitely saved my skin from drying out
i gave it 4 stars because unless you have oily skin i think it would be really drying
after i use it i can feel zero oil on my face
face oil it might be a little too stripping
i don't usually believe in spending a lot of money on a cleanser
the one for dry skin
it gets your face/skin so clean it will actually squeak
so my face is sometimes dry
i'll generally take the excess suds
- you only need a tiny amount of product to get a great lather
rinse with warm water at night as instructed a little goes a long way
typically to get this level of clean you'd have to sacrifice moisture
sometimes you need to wash your face
its great to use in the morning or if your skin tends to be sensitive
does not dry out the skin
not tight or dry at all
great for oily skin types like mine.
it gives me a deep clean that i have not experienced with any other cleansers
you'd expect it to be drying due to the foam
its odd for someone with oily skin
feel like it gets all the days oil
not dry or raw
also for people who have oily skin
want to feel that extra foaming
not overly dry when using this
oil free yet does not feel dried out
some are too drying
it doesn't dry out
i still prefer a warm water rinse no matter the weather or time of day
my face is normally oily around the tzones
it feels like applying water that isn't wet.
it does the work of a heavy cream
i love that it's for all skintypes because usually this type of product would make my oily skin even more oily
since i don't need as much moisture there
does not leave my face shiny or greasy
have a lot of problems with face creams either breaking me out
doesn't make me any more oily
this gives me nice hydration without being too heavy
not too heavy...works to smooth all day.
'm always on the hunt for a better moisturizer that combats both of those issues
with a non-greasy after feel
or just dry skin
for the past year i have been searching for a light moisturizer that would not leave my face feeling oily
let me tell you, i have oily/sensitive skin.
you can put you liquid foundation over it
didn't want to feel like i have plaster on my face
nice product, not too heavy and fast drying!
it really works by filling in those little wrinkles on your face
most of the moisturizers i have tried are too heavy for our climate
is not greasy at all
i can burn within 10 minutes, easy.
f i put it on for the day i have to put on sunscreen that is spf 50 or higher
though i ussually don't leave home without wearing powder
it is not greasy
the hylauronic acid actually dries out my skin since i live in a super dry climate
when there is no moisture in the air
the hylauronic acid encourages the skin to seek moisture where-ever it can find it
if there is little to no moisture in the air
a great cream for those in humid climates for sure
i love this heavier cream in the colder
this eye cream can be a little expensive
it does very good work to your skin surrounding your eyes
fine lines without feeling heavy or oily
i love it because it absorbs so quickly so you don't have to sit there fanning your eyes for it to dry
i am liking it better than my usual go-to eye creams
the wrinkles aren't getting any deeper or any less
it doesn't stay greasy at all
wipe some off the pump because the pump delivers too much product
i feel like it does work more than other eye creams on the market
i plan to continue to use it on the brow bone though because it was so effective there
you only need to apply a small amount to the brow area
doesn't let highlighter settle in lines
quickly without having to rub
doesn’t feel greasy because it soaks in so completely that i can’t tell that i’ve even put it on
you have to shake the bottle very well
what i can tell is that the skin better absorbs this one compared to shiseido eye cream
the serum really stays in the area where you apply it
upon first touch you can tell this cream is expensive
you know it is working b/c you can smell the tea tree oil as you cleanse
does not make a huge lather so you know there's no residue left after rinsing
do wait the 20 min after washing your face to allow some natural oils to return
so on off days my other skin products tend to sting a bit when i apply them
since it can be a bit drying if you use it daily
it left me with some flakiness
then at night my face is still moist
was really tired of all the flaking
as i age my once tough skin needs babying.
it didn't dry me out
using it too many days a week when your skin isn't used to it will irritate your skin
doesn't leave dry patches
i think it's because i started using it in the cold dry winter months
peeling skin like i did in the beginning
as soon as i wash my face
as well as to find something that could finally get rid of the yucky brown patches of sun-damaged skin on my cheekbones
i couldn't believe how soft my skin was when i rinsed it off
be prepared for a lot of peeling skin
you'll protect your new skin
won't find yourself with new sun damage to erase
some good moisturization could not cover up
it might burn it.
i can only use poetry in lotion once a week without getting flaky
i feel a "soothing" feeling when i apply this that i haven't felt with other high-potency products
if i have dry spots from my daytime aha product
or suddenly spit out too much product
i did not use my normal make-up while my skin was peeling
therefore dryness might happen when first trying.
the cream seems to help not only with aging
otherwise i get a lot of peeling
it took me a few days to realize that my daily bowl of frosted mini wheats was causing a rather bad breakout after three days of using the lotion
i feel pretty comfortable after a week going out with only a little mascara on
i peel a little for a day or two
i put a little vaseline on before bed to combat the tight feeling as my skin is a little reactive while its peeling
i can tell my skin hasnt dried or i didnt feel any adverse reactions while using it
having used prescription strength retin-a before i was expecting either dry peeling skin or no results at all
would use sparingly especially if you have not tried retinol before
which is kind of a problem since i use bare escentuals powder as my foundation
my skin feels so dry during this 20 minutes
i didn't have perfect skin before
it doesn't leave a sticky or wet feeling on the face
never feels sticky or greasy
so happy i found a moisturizer i can use daily without feeing like my skin is burning off
love that you don't dip your finger in to get it out
tends to get dry easily
my skin doesn't feel sticky after using it
especially in the winter with the cold temperatures
i do not have to worry about dry winter skin when using this product
in the winter i'm so dry
i didn't get a residue feeling from it
my skin can get a little on the dry side
i live in a harsh dry climate
even if you have dry skin
seriously have struggled forever to find a moisturizer that actually works without making me breakout/greasy
my skin wanted to peel itself off my face
doesn't irritate my skin at all
for those people with sensitive skin don't be afraid of this product because you won't break out or get redness
dry skin with more normal t-zone when winter rolls around
especially the dry spots that i unfortunately experience on my face in the wintertime
i need something heavier in the winter
i need something heavier for winter
it does not leave my skin oily at all.
non-greasy and a little goes a long way.
only reason i give it a 4/5 is the texture--i think it's a bit runny so you really have to rub it in
cytocell along with her quench serum as nothing seems to work as well for my skin
i simply cannot live without my nourish
i love the pump it makes everything seem so more hygenic
this one does not have an irritating spf in it
probably more on the dry side
great for combo or dry skin.
it goes on lightly
i wish it was a little more rich though as it doesn't leave my skin feeling especially soft
even with my oily skin i worried it wouldn't be a strong enough moisturizer
i find it very beneficial using it with my clarisonic brush
i found that it made my face just to oily looking
just was to much "moisture" for my skin
the weather is getting colder
it doesn't irritate my skin at all
except for those that are really oily or need more moisture
if so you would prefer a richer cream like goat milk
i would be straight up in the poor house if it meant something that would offer me beautiful angelic skin
not greasy at all
even in -30 snowy weather my skin feels way less dried out than before
it has just the right amount of foam
how some people find this tube messy
after recently moving from a very humid climate to super dry my face was in need of a gentle yet effective cleanser
is gentle enough to use everyday
i like that it doesn't dry out my skin too much after using nightly
they feel too thick
i needed something to help with the harsh winter weather
did not dry out or irritate my sensitive skin
it will get drying
it did not irritate my skin
whether i use it with the clarisonic or not- it leaves your skin so soft
it never feels like my skin is dried out or over-cleansed
if i do get a breakout i bump it up to the kate acne wash
some dry spots- this helps with it all
i did not find it drying at all
i do not use it regularly at night as i have oilier skin
be sure to really keep lathering for 30 seconds as it suggests to get the best clean
literally the only bad thing is the scent or lack thereof- be sure to smell in the store or try a sample if you're iffy about it
otherwise you'll dry out your skin
nothing that would be too abrasive
that means your skin is clearing out
it gets skin truly clean without the need for a gritty or coarse texture that is found so often in other best-selling facial washes
i love this because it doesn't dry out my skin.
foam is not necessary to be clean
it is a bit annoying to have to wipe the cap every time you screw it closed
the gentle daily wash is just what the description says
did not leave residue
not greasy or leaving anything behind
not tight or dry
plus it isn't drying at all
the biggest difference though is my clarsonic brush is cleaner afer i use the kate sommerville facewash than any other face wash
it cleans but doesn't dry out my face.
does not strip all the oils
never tight or dry
i like the consistency of the wash.
its not drying at all yet does a thorough job cleaning
i like this product because it doesn't dry my skin
when used in the am doesn't leave skin with film so you don't get oily or feel tight
would be great for combo or oily
doesn't dry out my skin
there is zero drying afterwards in fact i have stopped using a toner because kate's line is so balanced
super dry conditons in the winter
does not dry your skin out
spend most of my time in the kitchen which causes my face to be oily
just avoid getting in your eyes obviously ;)
it does wash all off
i do feel little drying
not tight or dry
i tried this cleanser after months of trying to find the perfect daily face wash that could solve my recently-developed problematic skin
get your face treated
does not dry out.
i love how this cleanser works quickly to clear up breakouts when i slack
it doesn't dry out my skin
it doesn't dry me out or strip my skin
it doesn't feel as though the skin as been stripped
it probably won't help with acne if you using it on skin with makeup on
it does not dry out my combination skin
i feel like it really gets the dirt off
which sometimes i use oil in the shower
*can be drying not much product is needed
does dry skin out a little
somehow my dry patches where i'd get acne from dry skin was soft
has a cool twist top that is easy to use in the shower so you don't spill any when trying to put the cap back on after getting cleanser out
i feel like it cleaned out all the junk in my skin
it's not drying to me at all
i've tried all kinds of cleansers for my oily/acne prone skin that doesn't dry me out in the chicago winter
it doesn't dry me out at all
it does not dry my face so when i don't use a make up wipe before cleansing my face
get everything off without being overly dried out
since i have combo/dry skin i just use it once a day
the only problem is this is kind of drying.
but i'll take that side effect if it clears skin.
it is not drying at all.
i feel like this is the only cleanser that doesn't make it worse or irritate my skin
not so much of the combination dry/oil before this product
at first i didn't like the gel consistency of it
i did find that it made my skin a little dry
i forget to wash my face sometimes
it is not drying
it doesn't dry out my skin either.
my skin doesn't feel tight if i have to wait a bit before i have a chance to apply my moisturizer
i feel it works best if used along with the clarisonic brush
constantly wiping off the cap so that it doesn't have residue that will get on my counter
m not sure that this face wash alone got rid of my acne
made me acne prone skin chill out for quite awhile
doesn't dry the skin out either.
it doesn't dry out my skin
it doesn't over dry my skin
the best part is my skin doesn't feel dry or tight after using it
more oily in the summer
a bit more dry in the winter
this is the only face wash i have ever found to control my oiliness
want a product that won't dry out your skin
does not dry your face out nor make it oily
i tend to use too much with this type of tube.
it really does clean deep down
does not dry my skin out all it feels normal not oily around my nose like usual even at end of day
would say it also works great for oily skin
haven't tried it on oily
after one day of using my skin didn't get oily.
my dry spots moisturized without being greasy or leaving me looking shiny
even when using a combination moisturizer i was never able to find a one that fits perfeclty to my skin
i recommend this product if you have a combination to oily skin
t provide my skin moisture without making me oily
this is the best even if i get a rash/allergic reaction from a product this cream gets rid of anything on my skin
i can now go hours without having to dab oil off my nose
i like using this on its own or even adding a couple drops of my favorite oil to give my skin some extra hydration
it does not leave my face oily
this moisture does not make my skin oily at all
my face doesn't get oily at all the rest of the day
i wouldn't recommend if you have extremely dry skin bc i noticed it did little for the existing dry patches i had
oil zones as it also didnt overly moisturize those areas either
literally can not use any moisturizer on my face i have tried so many famous br
not as quick as a gel thought
i feel like i do need more moisture in my dryer areas
if you are oily all over your face
my face is definitely less greasy by the end of the day
worth the price tag to have a hard working moisturizer that doesn't inflame my sensitive oily skin
it has this cool jar/pump container where you press the top
i tend to be more on the oily side
it is the only other moisturizer besides this that hasn't made me break out
dry patches of skin that had started to form during a particularly cold winter
like i need to wash my face again
i like it better than goat milk because it doesn't make your face oily
so your face doesn't feel oily or heavy after using it
does not dry my face
keeps my t zone matte so much longer than before
for someone who needs moisture
not if skin is super dry
i don't love the container with the pump lid although i was told it's so your h
i am on the oily side
this moisturizer is one of a few that doesn't irritate my skin or make my easily congested skin break out
it doesn't leave my skin oily or shiny
as it doesn't provide enough moisture
i don't get nearly as greasy as i do without it
it takes care of the little dry patches i get in the winter time
it doesn't burn like most oil control products do
i needed to find a more intense moisturizer that wouldn't make me break out
not sure how well it minimizes my oily skin
does not cause excess oil
now with colder weather needed something more
perfect for people with oily skin or for the hotter summer days
really oily at the same time
not sure how my skin is too polar opposites at the same time
i am a little worried that it won't be able to hydrate my skin well enough in the cold
this keeps me moisturized all day long without me feeling like my skin is producing extra oil to compensate
have really improved my skin because i assume a lot of gunk like unwashed makeup in my pores
next comes the speech about regardless of how oily my skin is
especially in the summer when i'm extra oily
my face is not oily or dry at the end of the day
my only issue with the cream
your fingers will never touch the inside of the jar- yay cleanliness
that might be good for my skin that tends to be very oily
i saw my skin wasn't an oil slick like it typically is in the morning
did not leave any oily residuals
doesn't make my skin oilier or break me out
for my combination skin i felt at first that it would make my face tacky
probably need a bit more help in the way of moisture
i purchsed it twice since it really moisturized my skin without breaking out
have struggled to find a moisturizer that doesn't make my skin feel oily
the only setback is it does dry out my skin a bit
no longer get dryness like that
i am lucky enough to get very few pimples
it doesn't disturb the look of the bb cream for me
does not dry my chin
honestly i never have this issue because my skin is so oily
nothing helped these pesky blackheads that are pretty much everywhere
this can make you feel a little dry so after it's absorbed i apply sunday riley tidal which i'm not blown over by so once it's finished il try clinique moisture surge
this can be a bit drying if used morning
the product did dry my skin out
believe or not gets rid of your black heads
it will irritate your skin and sorta dry it out.
salicylic acid products do nothing for my skin except make me super flakey
more oily in the summer
i get dry very easily
your skin will get worse before it gets better!
if you are better with benzoyl peroxide then this is a really great product
as the instructions read start off slow with it because if you use to much it can be drying
it can dry out your skin
unlike some other reviewers i did not find it drying
now this stuff can be a little drying so definitely moisturize well
the areas i apply this do feel a little dry
haven't had any issues with it drying me out at all
i will now minimize my usage as it did dry out of my skin
it really dried out my skin
just make sure you use a good moisturizer as it can dry out the skin a bit
t didn't dry me out
it does dry out your skin
except it doesn't create those dry
it won't dry all the way up or come to the surface
it only seemed to be getting worse as i tried my usual cleansers
often the products seem to make things worse by irritating the skin
then thought i needed a different lotion that didn't make me as shiny
unfortunately it has stained my pillow case pretty bad
clears my skin up like nothing else.
it does dry my skin out a little
this has literally been the only product to keep me pimple free for pretty much everyday that i use it
i would have given it five stars except for the fact that it dries up you skin a little
because obviously it hasn't cured my skin or anything
now if i get blemishes they're small
its drying if you use it everyday so just make sure you moisturize your skin :
it does dry my skin out a bit
after using this i only get one or two pimples that don't ever surface
just be careful it could possible dry your face
i now only get the occasional "i forgot to take my makeup off before bed" pimple
it does dry my skin out around my mouth
while this does irritate it if i wear it during the day
it basically puts all the hydration back into your skin
only as long as it doesn't dry you out
this product has completely cleared up my skin without drying it at all
they were all drying to some degree
plus this does not dry out my skin
it also doesn't burn.
like that it doesn't make my skin greasy or sticky feeling
it really helps to dry them out
on a side note it can dry your face
f you have acne all over your face put this stuff everywhere
it is by far the only product that i've ever used that actually gets rid of the blackheads on my nose completely
this product has made my dry skin worse
i only recommend it for folks with very oily skin as it will dry you out
they would dry out my skin on the top
i also like that my skin isn't as oily as it was when i was using products with salicylic acid
my skin has always been a hot mess.
it does dry me out quite a bit
let's just say that i would freak out if this was ever discontinued… so upsetting that so many benzoyl peroxide products left the shelves a few years ago
i ended up having to get another moisturizer just so my face wouldn't be dried out
it hasn't dried my face out
they either dried out my skin or made my acne worse
this is the only one that works for me without drying my skin
then break for a day because it dries out my skin
the dry skin is not even bad compared to how dry other products would make me
it can dry up your skin a little bit
then this lotion only on problematic areas
it will burn sensitive areas of your face like apples of your chicks
moisturize your skin at least twice a day because this product tends to dry your skin a little bit
keep your face from getting too dry
unless you are very oily naturally
it is very drying though.
this cream is so gentle on my skin i know that if i have had a flare up this will calm it down
it doesn't sting my skin when i have overexfoliated
am dry in other areas
maybe autumn for most normal/normal to dry skins
whether it's from the sun or salt water
i wasn't convinced it was enough moisture
the oils is that i don't look shiny after a couple hours
dry this winter which is odd because i have oily skin
great for winter and really dry skin!
wish the change in weather my dry skin was flaking every time i even touched it
i feel like my skin is finally moisturized- which when you have dry skin seems like it's never going to happen
when the dry patches on my face act up
doesn't cause the oil-prone parts of my face to get greasy
it does a really good job of soaking up all of the dryness out of skin
gross because in winter it gets very dry
sometimes instead of eye cream depending on the day's humidity levels
sometimes if i'm very very dry that day or i used a quite drying cleanser or mask
if you're very dry
or if the weather's dry
or if you've just blitzed your natural oils with a different product
after regular use of this product i no longer have scaly dry patches anywhere on my face despite regular use of somewhat harsh cleansers
i don't recommend it for people with dry skin because it is more of a lightweight cream
too greasy or just so so
i feel like it's really runny yet at the same time hard to blend in
do not leave my skin greasy
gets rid of any dry
the packaging is very deceiving theres nothing at the bottom in that bottle everything is from that silver seal
unlike most moisturizers it does not feel oily on my skin hours later
my skin seems to soak up every bit of it
/or overestimate how much to take out having to use your fingers or popsicle sticks to retrieve
i would recommend it to anyone who has dry skin
i really like that you actually feel like its nourish in your skin
they usually get dry throughout the day with my old moisturizer
you need this if you have really sensitive skin like super sensitive skin or eczema or whatever
the goat milk is great during the summer for my normal to dry skin
keep in mind i have really dry to combination skin
the reason i like ks moisturizers is because they do not leave any residue on your h
i rated 4 stars because i find that wearing under my nars foundation makes it a bit oily
didn't think i was going to care for it because my skin is on the oily side
it was beginning to look more drier than usual
somehow it felt a bit oily for me back then
my skin didn't get shiny or heavy later in the day either
then this winter is really drying my skin
the new formula works great on my combo skin even in hot weather
'm happy with that given how hard it is to find the right moisturizer for my skin in hot weather
it also doesn't feel sticky which is a plus.
for reference i have dry sometimes dehydrated skin that tends to break out
it has never broken me out as most moisturizers do
my face is so dry
i think it's the coconut oil sitting on top of your skin
since i'm on accutane i'm pretty sure i could rub chicken grease on my face
the spring dispenser isn't my favorite as the product can come flying out if you push too hard
if my acids dry me out with this putting my skin back perfect if i use it day
as someone with dry
my skin no longer flakes or feels tight because i use this nightly
i get dry flaky patches even in summer
not heavy or greasy
doesn't leave my face oily
i don't recommend this for people that have oily skin as it may be too greasy for them
it didn't break out my super sensitive skin
he told me that it would help with my dryness
it's a little too heavy for the summer coming up as i tend to get very oily in hot weather
i think it's unsanitary because a lot of bacteria can be attracted to the cap
doesn't dry me totally out but really cleanses.
trying to find one that would help control my oily skin
recommend this for people with oily skin problem
makes all of my other products work better because my pores are super clean
its really good at removing eye make up too!
kate's daily detox cleaner once a day so that my skin doesn't get too dry
they usually dry my skin
my skin isn't oily all day
i love this wash for my oily skin.
clean without stripping out all the oils or leaving you with a gummy feeling
since we can't physically shrink our pores
if yours are large or you're concerned w/ them because you get oil/debris clogged in them making them look even larger
if you're normal/dry
if you're normal/dry
don't think of this as a scrub
i actually have very dry skin
not only has my skin improved drastically as far as the moisture level while not leaving my skin greasy
this product definitely works without making my skin flush
so you don't have to dig your fingers into the jar
almost feel like putting whipped cream on your face that soft
a tad is all you need to cover entire face
i can tell i need more hydration-this product has smoothed me out
s everything in life these so days that is worh a lick
maybe not evern dailty use for those of us with very oily skin
your face will be super smooth in a week!
ptr unwrinkle when really cold weather
even tho i have very dry skin i can use it for about 2 days at a
i think this is probably better suited for someone with normal to dry skin because of it being so heavy
as i felt it might add some moisture under the eye
if you pump out too much rub the excess around your lips
the dispenser gives out too much cream so you have to be careful to not press too hard
this is the only eye cream that doesn't cause that milia stuff too
my skin has been so dry this winter
it does feel like a bit much when you're first rubbing it in
"quench" applied right after a shower or face wash does the trick
is enough to cover my face
not flakey dry but just tight.
my skin was taking its revenge on me after i totally unnecessarily began using a salicylic acid face wash
i believe this is because it helps balance out the moisture
helps with the overproduction of oil that happens when your face is dry
i live in a cold climate
so my skin is constantly in dry air
don't feel like i have to slather it on my face
you only need about half to one pump for your whole face or it'd probably be too greasy
even for dry skin
it may be a bit oily feeling for some
i'd recommend this if you have normal to dry skin
for oily skin this might be a bit much
this saved my skin from getting super dry
my skin would just suck it right up
i imagine that for those will oily skin
not oily at all
adding oil to dry skin is what i've needed all along
in the winter it gets very dry
it feels kind of oily when you first put it on your skin
i gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because it is a bit oily
it does soak in but it takes a while.
have incredibly oily parts of my face
i actually find that it's helping to keep my acne at bay
i can't believe how this turned around my dry skin
doesn't make my t-zone feel oily
this is a must have for any woman with dry skin!
as i have combination skin that completely dries up in cold weather
at least not on dryer sections of my face.
i allow it to soak in while i deal with other things like my hair before applying anything else
you might think this wasn't good for skin that gets clogged easily
love it because you can apply any moisturizer over it once it soaks in
the way it absorbed perfectly into my skin without making it feel/look oily
the product works great for my skin type during the drier fall/winter months
i put a little bit of this serum on my face
at first it comes off as very oily
this stuff is pure moisture without being greasy.
quench is unlike anything i've ever used before.
you can feel your skin plump in no time at all
goes deep down to get rid of my dryness
let alone not clog my skin
however i find the super thick liquid consistency puts me off
i never feel greasy.
it is not heavy
you only need a half squirt to cover your entire face
this really helps with my dry winter skin.
i only use this at night though since my skin is more oily than dry
not just winter dry skin
does not make my face look greasy
it feels "oily" when first applied
it never feels too oily
i tend to be oilier in the spring/summer
lightly pat it on to my dry areas
it's not oily after the application
said it wouldn't break me out even though it contains some oil
like separate or get flaky
it just gives that little extra bit of moisture
i often add a few drops to my moisturizer or clarins uv40 to give the products more "slip" for even coverage
your face just drinks it up
goodbye dry cheeks...i won't miss you!
it seems oily at first
which tend to be dry
iit does go on oily
as long as you are wearing foundation or powder
it will not shine through because it dries so quickly leaving a smooth dry finish
it will absorb fast if you use just a tad bit.
it will be greasy if you use too much.
gets clogged up if i use something really heavy
at first you make think it feels oily
although it looks like oil coming out of the pump
your face will be so soft
it feels a little oily upon application
one quick pump is more than enough to cover your face
your face just drinks it up!
this is the only cleanser that actually helps to keep it down
this doesn't cause my skin to flake or become red with prolonged consistent use
my face doesn't feel dry at all after using that
doesn't dry my skin
the only downside is that i didn't see it helping my impurities
it did not dry it out or irritate it
if u have sensitive skin it wont leave u with redness on your face
i usually don't use anything when i washed my face
doesn't dry out your skin
its not drying to me at all and i have dry skin.
i noticed some people say it made their skin feel dry
you only have to use a tiny amount to get a good lather going
it doesn't dry out my skin
it does not get too foamy which i like
feels really good at scrubbing away all the dirt
you really need the smallest amount to cleanse your face
doesn't strip my face-- i never feel like my skin is dry
get enough lather to wash my entire face
it never caused my sensitive skin to breakout or dry out at all
i honestly thought there was no way to get rid of the little bumps under the skin that weren't quite pimples
i can even feel how it makes my face squeaky clean as i use the clarisonic
it make my face drier than usual
it can not only gentle clean any water proof make up
if you use it with a clarisonic brush
it even though it's a little drying after
remember not all oils are bad for your skin
i stuck wtih it because i have really sensitive skin
i wasn't too keen on spending $60 on a cleansing foam
the oiliness isn't as excessive as it usually is
really does a good of deep cleaning
it doesn't make your skin tight or dry
my skin rarely breaks out anymore
definitely one that doesn't strip the skin or leave the "tight" feeling that many foaming cleansers leave
doesn't dry my skin out
it foams so well that you only need a very tiny amount
i do feel like it can get slightly drying
i also really like that this product is sulfate free since my skin can get really dry
the teeniest little bit will foam up like crazy
i really feel like this gets every last bit of makeup off of my skin without drying it
only downside for me is that it burns if it gets in my nostrils however not enough to stop me from using it
it's one of the few that actually makes your face feel clean after using
it is not drying as well.
however if you have oily
amazing that what feels like a cream can so effectively clean my face without drying or leaving residue
my face is normally dry or oily
it really gets rid of your mascara nicely too.
you have to gently rub your eyes to really work out the water proof make up
may need to add a litle water too to help it loosen it up more
i would recommend using the oil cleanser since it seems to make it easier for waterproof make up to melt off
i love this cleanser because it doesn't leave any white residue n it's super gentle on your skin
it has no oils and i do not break out from it.
i talk myself into trying a less expensive cleanser
i am constantly frustrated by all the drying products out there
more moisturized than with any other product i have ever used
i rarely find washes i'm in love with.
never tight or dry
there are no harsh chemicals in it so you don't have to worry about any overdrying like most acne products
impuritiesface is absolutely streaky clean afterwards with no drying or irritation
this is the only face wash i can use when i have flare up from rosacia
it doesn't leave any residue behind
while i was trying to control the breakouts i was over drying my skin
recommend for people with dry skin!!
my face is not oily
it's not as harsh on my skin in the winter
yet i wouldn't say that it's exfoliating because i only get 2 or 3 beads per use
most importantly it doesn't irritate my eyes
s completely dry before you use this product
didn't strip my face of natural oil
in my opinion it's a good complement for my clarisonic because it cleanses without stripping moisture from my face
i got rid of all of my "oil control" products
it's saved my poor, dry winter skin.
i mean you might have to go back with 1 cotton round to remove the tiny bit left over mascara on your under eyes
you'll notice a huge difference in your skin just from cleansing
without stripping too much natural oil
your skin doesn't feel dry afterwards.
not at all oily
it even help smooth out my skin further on top of cleaning it thoroughly
doesn't leave your skin feeling like there's still a film at the end of it
i normally use it before getting into shower.
usually burns when i wash it while on vacation
does not dry it out
very good for people who produce excess sebum because you can wash your face multiple times a day
dry it on a white towel that there is absolutely no trace of makeup on my towel
it is meant for washing with your hands.
but note that it does not foam very much.
it is not greasy at all
i am always hesitant to try something moisturizing because that can cause my chin to break out
i'll see if i need to go back to a less moisturizing wash at that time
it does not become oily at all
does not leave any residue
it does not irritate or dry my skin
not overpowering to me in the least
this product cleans up make-up very easily without rubbing the skin hard at all
my skin is actually less oily now that i've been using it
i simply apply 1 to 2 pumps to my face with my fingers
otherwise it can get into your eyes very easily
make them burn a little
i've got to take it off with my philosophy purity cleanser or else i end up using too much of this stuff
i've got oily skin that just holds on to make up so well :p
even though my skin is in fact oily
in my dry alberta weather it really helps keep my oily skin at bay
nor does it leave your face feeling like there's still oily residue clinging onto your face
get oily in my t-zone
the though of getting an oil-based cleanser scared me
it actually feels amazing when you massage it into your skin
i realize that one is too thick/heavy textured to remove my eye make up easily
t doesn't get in the eyes while getting the eye products off- splash water on my h
s just enough to get it wet
there is no fear of oily residue
thought i wouldn't like the cleansing oil because of how oily i am usually
then if you activate it with water
anyone who doesn't like the texture or after-feel of oil- stay away
that it would make my breakout-prone skin even more oily
i keep coming back to ap's cleansing oil because it really is the best
this is not one of those heavy oils
i especially love this cleanser during our dry winter months when my skin doesn't need any harsh
we moved from a humid climate to a super dry area
my skin will get very dry sometimes here
a lot of moisturizers aggravate it or make me break out
constantly i need to use those little "rice papers" to absorb a little of the oil my skin produces during the day
is not harsh or drying while doing so
this oil seems to keep the moisture in
actually leaves your skin less-so than it was before
we just want to clean our skin leaving it silky smooth
add a little bit of water
it doesn't leave a film on your skin or feel like it hasn't washed away completely
any residual eye make-up off
if you can endure the smell its a nice cleanser
the skin doesn't feel oily at all afterwards
i got this as a sample first- i couldn't quite comprehend an oil cleanser-
you apply this oil to a dry face
work it in then wet your h
to think a old cleanser would be good for me skin right
doesn't feel heavy or oily or leave your skin feeling gross
is rich enough to work thoroughly into your skin
as the weather gets warmer
i usually do about 2-3 pumps into my h
my makeup washes away so cleanly that sometimes i skip clarisonic
i know that i'm not putting too much pressure onto my skin wiping everything away
i do prefer the way my skin feels with the cleansing foam
when i use the toner there is nothing left on the pad
the one downside it that if you don't take the time to thoroughly create an emulsion
then you are stuck with having to put moisturizer on not-so-clean skin
but that goes with any cleansing oil.
i think it does a great job of gently cleansing the skin
another cleansing oil that is very effective yet does not leave my skin dry
doesn't dry out my skin
not oily or tight
good cleansing oil, but a little expensive!
clean without making it over oily or overly dry
now i don't even worry about the oil in the cleanser
the cleanser does not cause me to break out
i did find them to be unpleasantly strong
if you are combo oily, get this.
this cream soothed my face so much even though i was expecting it to break me out due to the strong perfumed smell
creams just don't help my problem with being oily halfway through the day
anything hydrating normally is a bad idea for me during day time
this is much better than my dr jart water drop- that one tended to pill under my makeup
actually not irritating on my skin at all
usually i thought oil-free
this is perfect for me living in a humid climate
it is so soft and does not dry out at all.
however i think you need to make sure you are washing your face with a good cleanser too
my skin didn't feel like it had a layer of anything on it
not make your skin feel sticky or oily
all of the other products i've tried will make my skin oily-looking
even during the winter when i could use a bit of a heavier moisturizer i just mix a few drops of boscia'stsubaki oil with this
i think i could get away just using this moisturizer in the summer
to the point where i sometimes sneeze after putting it on
and it moistures your face very well.
i get so many people saying that my skin looks like porcelain
when my skin tends to get a bit dryer
i cook with it and now my skin is as silky as it.
i get compliments on my skin all the time
my face didn't feel greasy or oily
even though i'm combo oily
greatly recommend for people with oily tzone like mine with normal skin
it gives the right amount of moisture without leaving you oily
haven't had issues with break outs on my oily skin
i just wish they had a spatula so that i don't have to dip my h
it also dries quickly so no waiting minutes for it to absorb before my makeup goes on
it either dried out my skin
made it really oily or made me break out a lot
so you won't go through the jar very quickly
on a humid or rainy day it basically feels like a wet sponge
$60 creams that didn't work so was pleasantly surprised to see an provement in my skin right away with this
my oily t-zone doesn't end up like an oil slick by mid-day
if your skin gets dry in winter like mine
tends to linger for some time after applying
does not leave my combination skin oily
it doesn't leave a sticky film on your face which is what i find is the case of most of the other moisturizers i've tried
however in the colder months i'd recommend using a richer cream as your skin is usually dryer
at the same time i can feel it balance out the dryness of my skin that occurs after i take a shower at night
though on the sad side it doesn't control the oil on my face
my skin never got oily nor felt tight or dry
a mineral foundation that usually leaves my skin looking a little more shiny than i'd like after a few hours of wear
does not leave an oily residue
i do tend to reach for something a bit more hydrating in the winter
finally found something that doesn't break out my skin while still nourishing it
in every area whether dry hot desert
does not make my skin seem oily
last night i decided to try it because my skin was feeling a little dry
which usually tend to just kind of sit on the skin
gives me just the right amount of moisture during the hotter months
i've found it also seems to do double-duty moisturizing during these colder months too
though it does linger on the skin for quite a while
i don't wake up feeling greasy like some other products
this has helped me pretty much completely get rid of any old dark spots from acne
keeps my skins from going dry
it's painful to have to shovel out so much money for a serum
they feel slick on the skin- not this one!
skin is not too sticky afterward.
you will not remove brown spots or brighten your skin if you are still allowing it to be in the sun unprotected
never causes my sensitive skin to be red or break out
it goes on smooth, not sticky, oily, or harsh.
i can't really pinpoint my glow or reduced fine lines on this or the other
making it appear perkier so you don't even need primer or illuminising products
for reference i have combination skin which tends to get very very dry in winter time
it makes it very difficult to soak up every last drop
f you have oily skin you may not embrace the formula as much
it pretty much made my skin even more oily
i usually use bobbi brown for make up
the texture does not dry out my skin like some other serum
though it might be a little difficult to tell when you are on your last drops as it is an opaque bottle
so add a moisturizer on top after you have allowed 2 mins for the product to be absorbed
beware to those of you with sensitive skin
it's just enough moisture so that you're skin doesnt get oily
have always had a problem finding a stable one that suits oily combi skin
dry on the rest of my face
because the cleaner is not too
i am not sure if it does anything to loosen blackheads
also gets rid of any dry skin hanging around
let me start off by saying my nose is one huge pore/blackhead
seems to be less oily
i do not find it drying or irritating
it brings the "gunk" to the surface so that you can get it out with gentle pressure
way better for your skin than taking a hot shower
this vacuum cleaner did not irritate my skin further at all
i can't say that my pores look smaller
doesn't dry my skin out or irritate it at all
i still have rather oily skin
i feel like the pores no more line helps to keep them "cleared out"
the product near the top of the tube does tend to "dry out"
when you try to apply the dried up product
i can feel the product really cleaning out
i then let it dry
it really works to pull my blackheads right out
i also use this product sometimes before putting makeup on to dry up excess oil
you have to remember it's pulling out dirt that's deep inside your pores
then put a calming natural lotion on afterwards because it can make my skin a little dry feeling
just beware if you have sensitive skin as it does dry out your skin a bit
it doesn't leave my skin red
this product is fabulous at drawing out the oil so that the pores can close to their normal size
he even felt blackhead are less
why are the wholes on your face so big?"
doesn't do such a great job at making my nose pores smaller
it's drying even for a combination skin type such as mine
what it seems to do is just sort of dissolve the blackheads
i love their face oil.
especially if used right after the toner
was really drying my skin out
if you live in a dry/cold place
its never to soon to care for your skin.
i swear its only because girl products smell really sickly sweet most of the time or like potpourri this product is packed with great ingredients at a fair price it gives you glowing plump skin the only thing is be prepared to get looks for sephora employees saying
is soothing after you shave especially if you get razor burn
turned "my people" loose on him to pick the proper products for what he needs: jb pure clean daily facial cleanser
i wanted him to get the antioxidant benefits to keep his skin healthy even if he is not concerned about wrinkles
the liquid texture are just a bad combination for me
on rare occasions that i don't use these products my eys look so dry
just be careful not to spill the bottle!!
while it feels very oily when applied
i like the way it is filling it in
in the summer when i have to put sunblock everywhere including my eyes
if you like/need a creamy eye product this is not for you
my under eye area is always so dry that it's uncomfortable
a sun burn never goes away overnight for me
this is the perfect water bottle for your eyes!
a little tricky to apply because it's the consistency of water
the only bad thing was that my skin is oily
you there is no greasy feeling or shine whatsoever
it feels a little more oily than the original
can be a bit drying though
not greasy but it is like an oil.
your skin will love this!
therefore nothing you put on top of the skin is going to completely cure this imperfection
the mosture stays on all day and feels non oily
if my skin is feeling super dry i have always just add pure coconut oil
i also needle roll which really does not hurt
if your skin is dry you will need more.
you want the product to soak in and work.
my skin definately firmed up without drying out
i can see my skin lose firmness
be careful if you're oily or acne prone
even during our very dry winters in the desert
so when it was very cold
the weather very drying i couldn't use it
it feels like my skin is just drinking it up
if i use it every night i do tend to get flaky skin
i tend to be lazy when it comes to nightly treatments
actually sometimes i think my complexion is getting an "air brushed" effect
i still feel like my face just drinks this up
they often are greasy or thick or sticky
it really does feel like its "repairing" my skin after all the harsh medicines
skin which was fighting to recover from the cold winter winds
it didn't really help with my dryness though.
this really made quick work of cleaning up the mess from the retin a
i really like the fact that it does not irritate my sensitive skin like a lot of retinol products can
the only small issue i have is the new formula has a bit of a fish smell to me
it doesn't dry me out
i like it better than the charcoal mask.
i find that it really cleans all of the dirt off your face
i will say it feels somewhat drying
i do agree that it is somewhat drying
it does leave your skin a little dry after
*** moisturize well after using this because it does strip the oils out of your face so be sure to put that moisture back in
just be mindful that this product is drying so make sure to avoid your dry areas or patches because it will make it irritated if you put it on top
my skin was completely oil free
you can feel this thing just sucking all the grime right out of your pores
my skin was much less oily than usual
its meant to really dry any pimples you have
dry when i wash it off
it doesn't feel very dry after i wash the masd off
this one by clinique does an excellent job of clearing up breakouts quickly without irritating or over-drying the skin in the process
definitely get the clinique mask
this mask is excellent for spot treating or using over your entire face to get rid of toxins
wash it off with just cold water
it did clean my skin enough that i started getting these clusters of pimples in places i knew i had clogged pores
i like the feeling of this mask after i use it
it did not irritate my skin.
after years of trying many products to help me control my very oily skin
only apply this mask in my t-zone after learning the hard way that it can irritate my drier facial areas around my mouth
anytime i have a bump come to surface
which i appreciate because i hate having to spend 10 mins melting dried clay off
it can be drying though
t is probably not suitable for dryer skins or very sensitive ones
for people like me whose skin can get oily or break out at certain times of the month
while still being oily
i will always keep a tube to hand.
i wouldn't suggest putting this all over your face b/c it is drying unless you are oily all over
not too drying, but clears up my face!
it's good for very oily skin because leaves your face oily free
i still use it because it hasn't irritate my skin at all
the only reason i don't give it 5 stars is because i wish it dried out active acne
be careful of applying to much to dry skin as it can dry it out more if you're not careful
this can be a little bit drying to your bare skin
also gently as well- as long as you don't use it too often
you get an amazing glow on your skin right after your usage
the other thing that i love about this mask is that you can clear up your blackhead using this
don't leave it on your cheek or forehead that long since this is really drying
definitely worth buying if you have oily skin in any part of your face
definitely a cut above any mask you could get at a drugstore
whenever i feel i have a breakout coming on or if i'm extra oily i'll slap on some of this mask
it doesn't take that long to dry if it isn't super thick
need something to calm my skin this is the mask i go for
it was pleasant applying it
if i use this mask all over my face more than once a week it tends to dry some areas of my face
the longer you keep the mask on
it can be drying if you leave it on too long.
i might not have completely cleaned it off
it also does get rid of oil
it gets rid of all the extra residue on my face after a long day
but not so much to where i am peeling.
you would need a good moisturizer afterwards because it can be a little drying
be warned it is very drying
having to live with oily
it really does get your skin very clean.
my face is less oily
it's not drying or painful like some other masks
apply it all over my face quickly because it tends to dry rather fast
i've also noticed my face is that dry or that much oily
worth the buy also because you do not need that much for a mask just keep in mind that it dries rather fast so put it on your face quickly
i would recommend trying this out it you get oily skin
this mask is a must have for people with oily skin
then i wash it off with warm water
you could tell it pulled out a lot of gunk from my skin
or dry out my skin
the good this about it was that it was very drying in my problem areas so new acne wouldn't show up
it dried them out so they could begin to heal
that way, my skin is a bit less oily all day.
it does help with oil a little bit
thinking that the tube would better preserve the product unlike the tub that other br
this is perfect to dry out an oily complection after a long day around product
this stuff is still gentle on my skin that tends to dry out easy
my blackheads have also seem to go down a bit.
sometimes i will use is more often on my forehead if i have a bad case of breakouts
i still have a pretty oily face just not quite as bad as before
not to mention my skin was extra smooth
it is best to use the mask maybe once or twice a week because it does dry out your face which may cause your skin to produce more oil
it has worked wonders at plumping up my skin without making it feel heavy nor greasy
it is wonderfully hydrating without being too heavy or at all greasy
i do not have to blot my skin through out the day since i have combination skin
it really took away any dryness
it does have a scent so be careful
i find this rich enough that i can use it on my oily looking
it will rarely have a problem with pilling
/or the thought that the jar packaging is letting my $$$ possibly go to waste from the active ingredients being exposed
it's best to warm it between your fingers
it's difficult to find a moisturizer that can hydrate my skin enough without making it too oily
oily or heavy feeling
my face quickly absorbed this stuff like crazy
i wasn't seeing the crepey dry skin mid day
face cream in 1 so your getting a lot for your money
didn't feel like it washed it away when i washed my face
big plus is that it didn't make my sensitive combination skin inflamed or greasy as they day wore on
it was rich enough to keep me from having patchy skinc
is not heavy or greasy at all
it gets very oily after a while
most leave me with breakouts or not enough hydration
live in very humid climate
it immediately gets rid of any tightness i might feel
or if you live in dry climates
where the weather is very dry
does not feel thick or heavy
the moisture lasts all day long for me.
don't toss your bottle until you check if it's empty
my skin doesn't feel dry at all
i would recommend this to anyone who has oily skin with dry feeling
it's not heavy like a lot of face creams.
not greasy or heavy
this is one of the only creams that are gentle enought to not irritate my skin
desert climate where i live is brutal on the skin
tone has improved so much that i sometimes get confused because it looks like i'm still wearing foundation even though i just washed my face
didn't feel i needed instant moisture
maybe my skin even drank this stuff in
doesn't feel heavy on your skin
i need more moisture at night
completely once it's dried on my skin
if you don't like the smell just apply your moisturizer on top
i don't really have much in the way of lines or wrinkles on my face
i can see how a few reviews described it as wet dog
more like a wet dog
if your product smells like fish it's because the formula has gotten hot
i'd much rather have a fish oil smell on my face than put other ineffective stuff on my face
i don't know if my nose just ignores it now in self defence or some of my smell receptors were actually killed off
doesn't make my combination skin too oily
this product makes them disappear.
cold plasma face resolved that blotch so that i no longer need to apply cover up on that spot
like putting some kind of fish scale cream on your face
especially if you use it as it is intended -- you're supposed to put this on after your preferred moisturizes because this is a treatment
the first time i used cold plasma i could see a change in my skin
it does go away after it dries though
enough to coat my whole face
conservative enough to not leave a layer sitting on top of my skin
i only use it at night because i have oily
cold plasma is that one product that has helped my confused skin
what this does for my oily/sensitive skin is keep it in line
i see a lot of locked in moisture throughout the day
perricone's cold plasma is unlike any thing else i have ever used
just good stuff in there that my skin soaks up
i "used" to have so many issues with my skin until someone at sephora introduced me to cold plasma
don't use my fingers to get it out of the jar
some people have mentioned that cold plasma seems to smell a little better than it used to
instead of making my skin worse
you use a moisture over it anyway so by the time you apply your moisturizer the smell is gone
cold plasma is the answer for me.
i know when i put my usual spf on in the morning my skin glows like crazy
i cannot apply this product at night for fear the smell will drive people away or get on my pillowcase
i layered it under my face cream so the smell wasn't too much to h
if you buy all of your beauty products based on smell alone
i could care less if there is an odd smell for 5 minutes until it dries
my only complaint is that it's greasy after applying
it's the right amount of moisture without being oily
doesn't leave me flakey during the day
because you're pretty much just putting in bacteria from your face
my skin usually wants to be uneven especially because i love the sun
doesn't break me out either and no greasy feel.
this cream is starting to even out my skin
the extra moisture in this even better formula is super
i normally don't use moisturizer because it tends to cause my skin to break out
it's not drying either
its a little bit too greasy for me to use as it
my skin is dry so even though this item is a bit heavy
it wouldn't go away no matter how much i washed or exfoliated my face
now i've made this cream a part of my typical regimen so that the blemish doesn't reappear
my skin is so dry that i feel like i still need a
but keep in mind my dryness is extreme.
it's non-greasy which is a bonus for the dry wintry skin
really rich without being greasy.
it is not at all oily
it is not at all greasy
didn't make me break out or burn my eyes
works well in the winter when skin is drier.
goes on smooth: thick but not greasy at all.
and not oily or heavy.
need more moisture in the winter
as a women or man of color take my advice use this product to even your tone
on a hot humid day here in mn it is too greasy for my skin
doesn't make my face feel oily at all
i find it too drying for my skin {normal/dry}
when i started to get those brown patches on my face that some women get in pregnancy i just kept using the cream
for those of us with oilier skin types
i like it because it doesn't make my face greasy
i don't have much hope for my acne prone skin anyway
my t-zone is slightly too oily for this product
and it doesn't cause my skin to break out :)
it does feel heavy on your face though.
just dab your finger in you don't need much.
i do like that it moisturizes well without leaving my skin shiny
doesn't feel heavy or sticky
a little like bread dough if you ask me
it gives me the gentle moisture that i need
it gives me the perfect amount of moisture throughout the day
this product is not oily
and my sensitive skin does not break out from it.
doesn't leave it feeling heavy or oily.
true normally make my face greasy
while it does not make my face oily or excessively moist
be careful not to get it under the fragile skin under your eyes
other lotions just didn't take care of the dry flakes the way this stuff did
this stuff completely evened out the texture of every area of my face without being greasy
this lotion does the trick specially around my mouth it's very dry i can never live without this amazing product
does not get greasy on skin
post-acne spots go away even faster when you add the even better dark spot correcter to the regimen
if anything it calms my skin
i notice that now even when i forget to use it for a day my skin maintains good moisture between uses
this product is not greasy
i sometimes use this product at night because the sunscreen in it is a little heavy
makes my face a little more oily during really hot days
as someone who has oily skin
it is greasier than i'd prefer
not greasy which is a plus since my skin is on the oily side
i wont use this night time since its not a long lasting moisturizer
irritated as the weather gets colder
it's cooling when you first apply it
i find that if i spend a minute or so to massage it in my puffiness goes away
i used some harsh products to treat my oily/ problem areas
have shelled out more $ than i'd like to admit constantly trying out new creams from diff br
never causes milia under my eyes like some too-rich products do
i don't get a little milia spots when i use this cream
i like the way the cream feels when i apply it
it`s not oily and you can feel refresh instantly.
without feeling heavy or sticky
it also moisturizes just enough without being too greasy for me to put my make up over
a jar lasts a long time as you only need a little
stickier did not hold true for this product
i do use another cream on top because my eyes are quite dry
or if you have especially dry skin
easy to apply without that greasy feeling so common with these type of products
i think i will save it for the winter when it is dry
i think this a good product for very dry skin in a dry climate
for those reviewers who find this product too heavy or greasy
i did notice it did dry my face out a bit
this cleanser does a great job of making my skin feel very clean without drying it out
when i do get the occasional spot
however it can irritate your eyes if you get a little bit of it while rinsing
it does irritate my skin at all
i don't feel dry
i go through this like water
it does not strip my skin
i would totally recommend this face wash!
dry me out or wouldn't even move dirt
then wash with this
it didn't strip all the oils on my face off
never dries out my skin and is my go-to
it doesn't make my face burn or hurt
i still find i need a light scrub a few times a week
this cleanser got everything off after using it my skin felt clean it doesn't dry out my skin i love this cleanser so much
forth between cleansers: mild cleansers that didn't irritate my skin also didn't touch the oil
it does not dry out my skin
i couldn't wear my pressed mineral foundation
usually i always have some makeup or dirt residue left behind
didn't dry out my skin
my face never feels oily or dried out
doesn't leave my face dried out
it usually is too dry
this cleanser keeps me oil-free for a very good amount of time
my face doesn't get oily any faster
you definitely need to use an additional remover for water proof make up though
only cleaner that takes off all my make up
by sensitive i mean almost all cleansers will dry out my face
it did not dry out my skin at all
it doesn't dry me out
i still do use the red clay mask if i have a break out
is because i would warn oily skin types to beware
it doesn't do anything for oiliness
it cleared up my skin so quickly without drying it out or anything
this cleanser does not aggravate any of those areas
not to the point that it's dried out
i would recommend this product if you have oily or combination skin
no drying out or excess oil and no break outs.
my skin tends to be on the drier side
i needed to pick up an everyday cleanser just to get the dirt out
i like to use it in the shower when my face is really drenched
when i do they are only one small pimple
i usually have dry skin
it doesnt bother my skin
i would keep out of eyes because it does burn a little
my skin is way way less oily
plus no ones going to be smelling your face so that's just a small con to this amazing wash
once i wash it off
it doesn't feel right or like it washed too harshly
s face is really dry
can burn if it gets in your eyes
it doesn't cause my skin to break out
no matter the weather
may be a bit drying on already dry skin
my face gets insanely dry in winter
it does not leave my skin super dry after washing
in fact i only break out when i don't wash my face with this
in the winter my face gets very dry
great basic cleanser that doesn't dry my face or anything
not dry after using this
which i would classify gets dewy rather than oily during the day
once i started using this cleanser the pad was always completely clear
not drying at all
i really like this face wash.
it only has the medicinal smell when you are first putting it on
balances frothy face wash until i realized that origins does test on animals
they were all way too drying
sometimes i am too lazy when i get home from work to use my makeup remover
this does not leave your face dried out or oily after use
sometimes i see some dry patches
the climate i live in or just my skin itself
it is a little drying however
it feels so cool when i apply it.
yes it does sting a little after applying
*i also would add that i always wash my h
it started to make my finger texture hard temporarily so be careful
is thick but not heavy or greasy.
that this stuff "tingles" a lot when you roll it on
i get very little sleep
i usually apply then allow it to absorb instead of rubbing it in
the formula does burn if it gets anywhere near your eyes
it does tingle/burn a little bit when i put it on
would recommend storing it in the fridge to keep it cool
you can feel your skin tighten.
it was just too dark that even concealer cant conceal it unless i use too much that it would look cakey
it looks like that the ice cold tip does have more effect all in all its a great eye roller product that i will definitely recommend to my friends or anyone who suffers from puffy eye syndrome lol
could be on my end though due to allergies or not drinking enough water
it definitely did not dry out my eye lids more
does not make my eyes burn
i definitely recommend to people with dry or sensitive skin
in the winter my skin basically produces no oil
i love using this by itself or mixing it with argan or jojoba oil when it's below 20 degrees outside or very windy
i"m the kind of person that can get isolated hives on my face
i don't like using it during day though because it feels a little too heavy
rather something to soothe the skin if needed
can improve dry skin overnight if it isn't extremely severe
which can get really dry after shaving
if using on your face
this is the only moisturizer i can put on my legs without having a reaction
i love it in the winter when my skin seems to dry right up
any other places wear my skin is dry
i get really dry skin during the winter
i now no longer have the dry patches
recommend this to everyone who suffers from dry skin
sometimes it is hard to find moisturizers because the typical texture of those kind of products is often too thick
it doesn't make me more oily
i like to use this when my dry areas flare up
after washing my face i applied overnight to help with my dry patches
would always dread putting it on because it was so thick
however once you put it on the skin it feels lightweight
was noticing some dry patches from a sunscreen i use that also broke me out
it got rid of all my dry patches
this stuff is the only moisturizer i've found that doesn't cause me to breakout
at first i was worried it would pill under my foundation because of how thick the cream is
especially in the winter when my skin can get a little dry
was worried that using something labeled intense hydration would make my oily areas worse
i've found that it locks in moisture i didn't even know i had
doesn't leave you feeling like an oil slick like some cheaper options
still works very well for dry/combo skin like i have
forehead 24/7 no matter if it's winter vs summer or humid vs dry
none of them last long enough for me before my dry patches start flaking off again
so they get dry fast
will make me oily
i can sometimes have terribly dry skin
i also can have terribly oily skin.
i don't have dry patches anymore.
during the winter i get horrible dry spots that nothing could fix
there is nothing else i'll use for keeping my skin soft
i felt my skin didn't absorb it fast enough.
it is not sticky at all
i especially like the 8 oz one because i don't need to touch the cream directly
having crazy combination skin can make finding a moisturizer that actually works a nightmare
at the same time it feels like its doing its job holding moisture while absorbing quickly
not greasy at all
he would get very flaky
it does a great job of locking in moisture all night long
s too because they get really dry
no dry patches to worry about
this cream won't do much to thirsty skin
it doesn't do anything more than to moisturize the face
you must have a great skin that just need moisture
everytime i get sun burn or my skin is irritated for whatever reason
it is not greasy
this cream is perfect for all areas that tend to be a bit rougher
s get really dry from work
i've stuck with the because i'm afraid to venture out in worry that i will disturb my super sensitive skin
it didnt dry it out
i started using it during my accutane which obviously made my skin ridiculously dry
i still use the product now because my skin is generally dry
this cream doesnt irritate me at all
i don't use this during the day under my makeup because it doesn't mix well with my oily skin
makes you feel like your sweating in some way lol
it is so lightweight it doesn't have a scent to it which its great because my face tends to react sometimes
this works well with my dry patches
uses it sometimes to get rid of dryness
anything that is gel-like
after just one use, theres no more dry spots.
this moisturizer helped bring my skin back to life after epiduo stripped it of all it's moisture
t's hard to find a moisturizer without it that's good enough for my dry skin
i like that i can really coat my face with this
even though i drink a lot of water
it just leave me the whole bunch of textures
leave me a healthy dewy look even when i don't wear my foundation on
this is the only moisturizer that i was able to use during that time to provide me enough moisture
without burning or irritating or breaking me out
i would recommend this product to anyone with dry to normal skin
i would definitely recommend this to anyone with dry sensitive skin
my skin is no longer dry
it doesn't irritate my face at all
it is the only one i've tried that doesn't leave my skin greasy looking
this is my holy grail cream when my skin's condition is not that great
a lot of other environmental issue would make my skin really unstable
this is the only face cream i trust because it does not pressure my skin
i highly recommend it if you have dry skin or some type of skin issue
for someone like me who is getting dry skin related to aging
then i let it soak into my skin before i apply my night time moisturizer
this delivers without getting greasy like some hydrators
i think it would work with combo or oily skin
what can i say except that this stinky lotion calms my skin
this is due to the fact that i have extremely dry skin
this is one of the few products that doesn't further irritate my skin
cortizone is my go to for bad reactions
i like to use it when my face is still a tiny bit damp after the shower
great for the winter when skin is extra dry from the elements
pm in combination with other moisturizers because it's not enough moisture for me by itself
do have to wash my h
used this product exactly like my sephora rep told me to- a little dab will do right after cleanser
i also use it when my eyebrows get really dry
i keep mine in the fridge that way it feels super duper cool on my face
the only thing is that it burns when i put it on.
it doesnt feel heavy or greasy
i become super self conscience when i do not wear any makeup since i usually look like a tomato
on my cheeks i apply a slightly thicker amount that i do not rub in
rather i let my skin absorb it
which is a bonus for those of us with super-dry skin
because of the hard water here
have tried every product under the sun to even out my complexion
it doesn't leave a sticky feel to the skin
then increase to every day as your skin gets used to it
the only downside is that you use a dropper to put it on your face
my skin doesn't break out
doesn't irritate my skin at all
this did not dry out my skin
but i do not like the liquid.
i don't get dry patches anymore
could leave you with scarring if you don't use spf
i typically lose some of the product on my bathroom counter
also don't get discouraged if your skin is a little dry
it does seem to lighten my skin
it gets rid of dry
the only downfall is that it is very drying if you are exposed to sun while wearing
i would recommend this to anyone locking for something to even their skin out without drying it
it feels oily at first when you apply
it's very hydrating without leaving residue or making my oily skin worse
whenever i go a few days without it i notice my skin looks bumpy
i really like this serum as it is not greasy
does not over dry my already dry skin
as you only need a couple drops to cover your face
do recommend puting on your palm then apply with your finger
i did rub some of it on my h
they aren't dry or irritated
even though i use this on cleansed skin
your not greasy at all
is a rather pain to apply it cause you deposit few drops between your fingers
if you don't keep them tightly pressed together the liquid will run through
though is not oily at all
you will need like 10 drops to cover your face
it doesn't burn, itch or anything.
so makes me wonder about the amount of retinol again
if you completely fill the tube you will have oil running over your palms
the oil is so light
this product does make your face red
it doesn't make my skin break out
especially when fresh out of the shower
like with other retinols not on your eye lids as the skin is very sensitive there
serum on dry spots which doesn't seem to bother my face
this is not drying to my face at all
which is too much for my skin to h
you only need very little drops to blend it all over my face
its not too strong for my face which is good because usually i get flaky spots on my checks with other retinols
dryness especially if your skin is on the dry side
not sure if it's effective enough for deep wrinkles
it feels more like an oil than something that's supposed to be drying out my skin
this product does not irritate my skin at all
it doesn't dry you out
everything else still leaves some residue
i did not see or feel any oily residue left behind on my skin either
it removes make-up so easily even if they're waterproof
it also doesn't dry out your skin
instead it leaves it soft
doesn't leave my face feeling gross once i rinse it off
it doesn't dry me out like how other makeup removers would
don't recommend using in the shower as you have to put onto a dry face
i really like this face wash.
really dry in the winter
i just take a little oil on your palm
then i wash off with warm water
i like how it doesn't leave my skin feeling 'squeaky' clean like other cleansers do
the only thing i don't like about it is that it spills even when you close the nozzle
you can really feel the oil getting into your pores
it is not greasy at all
doesn't break my skin out
so when that's all washed away you know that all the sunscreen is gone
i felt like the sunscreen wasn't completely off my face
coming no matter how hard i scrubbed or how much lotion i put on before i showered or bathed
no oily feeling and no breakouts the next day.
this cleansing oil is not doing any harm
the only downside is how messy the oil can get when you pump it as it can slip between your fingers
fortunately, it comes right off with a rinse.
at first i was concerned because the word "oil" made me think it will clog my pores
it doesn't leave my skin super tight or oily/greasy
'm a little leery of just using the oil to wash my face
however not pleasant if gets into the eyes or mouth
put it only my dry face
does not over dry my skin at all either
i do feel the need to rinse my face with another cleanser afterwards because it does feel like a oily film is left on my face
doesn't dry out your skin
this cleansing oil did not clog my pores or make me break out
i know there's been times when i've been too tired to remove my sunscreen after a busy activity filled day
never thinking that all that sunscreen might be clogging my pores
i think when i put my finger on my forehead it should come off dry as a bone
it does not make my old lady skin feel dry.
since it is not drying my skin now it probably won't in the winter
for me it doesn't stay completely matte
would be perfect for those less oily than me because my skin is crazy oily so not much works with me
i found that if i applied it lightly
are starting to appear oily again
not just some powder
if have somewhat dry skin
can get oily in the t-zone
at first i didn't like it because it made my skin too dry
then i found that my skin would constantly get oily
obviously my skin was more dry to begin with
just know when to use it if you are on the dryer side
the humid weather can make me feel like my makeup is melting off sometimes
is never greasy or the least bit oily
you only need the tiniest little bit to cover your entire face
with a secure lid its never dried out where i couldn't use it
doesn't dry me out like most products that are mattifying or clarifying do
they made my face real oily
my face doesn't get oily anymore
i always had a problem with oily skin.
i only gave it 4 stars as it doesn't mattify my super oily skin all day
unless i end up sweating
this really helps my skin stay oil free
i let it fully absorb/dry
i knocked down one star because although it says the formula is noncomedogenic i noticed small bumps where i might have put on too much lotion
doesn't spread very easily
this is the best thing i have tried to date for some moisture for my face while still keeping my very oily skin matte
it does not provide as the moisture i thought it would
i really do not see yet how is this lotion works in anti-ageing compartment
pores would not tighten up on ladies who need it
it is so hard to finid products that don't clog my pores or make me greasy
i needed something for my oily/combo skins
no need to touch up with powder
your skin is not oily you develop some irritation from the product
this product will not make you greasy keeps you oil free all day
my skin doesn't get oily
typically my skin gets oily by mid-day.
i usually didn't need to use pressed powder over foundation
i don't have to use the oil blotting sheets i typically carry around in my purse
've had a hard time finding a moisturizer that wouldn't clog my pores
i know at 1:30pm everyday i will need to use 3-4 oil blotting sheets to get rid of the oil on my face
one for cold weather
dry in the winter
my face does not dry up in the winter elements when i use this product
that i've tried that actually control the oiliness in my t zone
i will say that it is not moisturizing enough for me in the winter
i am happy to add an additional oil free moisturizer because it keeps me from using blotting papers all day long
it leaves my oily skin matte all day so fewer touch ups
kept me matte all day long.
normally after a really long day my skin is shiny
i really needed something to keep my skin from getting so oily so early in the day
the two together are amazing for anyone with oily skin
too dry for winter.
it really does keep my skin less oily
that end up being too drying
it is not comedogenic
so i stopped that but still have oily skin.
it doesn't leave my face looking oily at the end of the day
i don't need to touch up with powder once
even though i wear spf through my bare minerals
for me, this works wonders on my oily skin.
it doesn't coat your face or feel greasy or sticky at all
this product does not irritate my skin.
i love that it mattifies shine without making my skin appear dry
i find that this is the only facial moisturizer that really lives up to its claims as being non-sticky
especially now that the weather's gone humid again
not at all oily
i can almost feel this stuff plump my skin up when i put it on
i get tons of compliments on my skin now.
it does look a bit "wet" when you put it on
my skin has always been oily in the t-zone
its been so terribly dry there that when i scratch my forehead it snows
normally use an oil free moisturizer because my skin tends to lean towards oily most days
velvety didn't actually feel heavy or oily when i applied it which is usually the case with those luxurious types of creams
i tried this because my skin is dry
only 4 stars because i don't like that it makes my skin more sensitive to the sun
the end of a plastic spoon to dip it out because you don't need much
could never seem to hydrate them enough
certainly not as dry
yes it may feel "greasy" at first
as long as i don't use too much my face absorbs all
you have dry in weather
no dry patches this winter!
living in a dry climate makes my skin so thirsty
during the warmer months i love the oil free hope in a jar
that just doesn't cut it for winter though
i live in a very humid climate where heavy moisturizers can be too much
just seem to sweat right off particularly for day
the first couple of times i used it i was so disappointed at how oily/greasy it felt on my face
found it too greasy
ts hard for me to find good quality moisturizers that don't irritate my skin at all
i've gone through 4 jars of this thing already because i seriously cannot find another moisturizer that does the job
i read in a magazine somewhere that if you put moisturizer or serum on your skin while it's still damp
a little bit of water still on your skin
i feel like this is the only moisturizer that i can use day/night without breaking me out
i agree with other reviews that it comes off greasy
will definitely smoosh off into your pillow rather than do its job on your face
smart to put it on after your shower or cleanse your face
i will say that if you don't have super dry skin it might be too thick for daytime use
it doesn't absorb to the point where my skin feels dry
it doesn't leave my skin shiny
so this may be too fluid for someone in a humid zone
i get lots of compliments on my skin
without it i can't seem to keep whatever temporary moisture i find through drinking water or using great creams
it's not as light as hope in a jar.
i can imagine it could be too rich for people with combination or oily skin
it really helps keep the cold from drying out my skin
would recommend this to people with dry skin
combination or even skin that tends to change during season like mine
never greasy or sticky.
dry air outside can make you look like a wrinkly mess
keeps things clear without over-drying
it comes with this pump stopper so you can travel w/out making a mess
when i lightly rub my face with this stuff i actually feel my makeup breaking apart
use this cleanser every few days instead of my normal face wash that it is a little drying sometimes
this oil cleanser is really great for me because it cleans thoroughly without drying out my skin further
i know it comes with something to attach to the neck of the pump
it still does not dry out my skin
just need wash the day off my skin
i've tried a lot of make up removers
i don't have to rub excessively hard
it doesn't dry out my under eyes
never caused any skin problems like some other cleansing oil might
not the clean tight feeling more like omg baby soft skin for the entire day
i feel like it helps my other products soak in better
just to be sure i double cleansed with it
after i used the product my face doesnt feel dry
face are dry when applying this
otherwise it will stay oily on the skin
there's no leftover makeup that comes off on a cotton ball with toner
before you wet your face
your face needs to be dry
have fully gotten it on your face then water must be applied to rinse it off
or maybe if you use it along with some sort of sonic facial brush cleaner like the clarasonic or foreo
t's a little hard to use if you're in the shower because it shouldn't be mixed with water for the best results
so much that when i returned the ineffective boscia gel peel
doesn't burn my eyes at all
i wipe it all off with warm water
as it does leave me a little too oily
or i get lazy because i wear a full face
it's like giving my face a cooling mask at the same time
cannot use oily products on my face otherwise i get really shiny- however
massage the areas for at least one minute or it'll leave stains
this works so well on my dry skin.
doesn't dry out my skin
there is no need to scrub.
there is no sign of grease afterwards
i don't feel dryness or any residue of my makeup- even water proof makeup
i cannot use most eye make up removers without it bothering my eyes
i enjoy putting a good oil on my skin
if you don't like oils once you apply warm water it changes consistency
t doesn't leave a greasy oily feeling
it didn't leave my skin oily at all
though next time i will probably put some on eyelashes while i am oil cleansing the rest of my face
cleansing my face without drying it out is a struggle
can dry my skin out
it removes waterproof make up so easily that you will never have to use make up remover ever again
just add a little water
if you get some in your eyes it doesn't sting just makes it a little cloudy- better than that soap in the eye feeling
meaning i clean with the oil
you can follow with a face wash
it takes everything off because when i use my clarisonic with a cleanser after
it's so quick to dissolve all my make up
every time they make my skin burn or my eyes except this one
viscous enough that it doesn't run through my fingers once i pump it into my h
doesn't leave any residue
it comes off so easily with just water.
massaging this oil into your skin really breaks up every bit of make up
it also doesn't dry out my already naturally dry skin
it has never broke me out even though other oil cleansers have
you need to use this on dry skin
the rest of my skin the normal
it doesn't leave any gross greasy film on your skin
it removes all the makeup without feeling a dry squeaky clean that probably makes my skin produce more oil
just a little bit of water helps it to foam up
then when you add water it turns into like a milk
totally-not-oily texture once water is added
it didn't make my face oily or cause me to breakout
it always remove all my make up even the water proof stuff since this is oil based
remember apply it to your dry skin
i usually follow it with a cream or foam cleanser to get the residual yucky stuff off
it also doesn't dry my skin out which i really like
they were either too greasy or made me break out
this one can be a little greasy when you first apply on your face
i found it's best to apply a small amount to dry face
doesn't dry out my skin in the process
this stuff will rub it right off without
is to put it on your skin
have lightly scrubbed your entire face then you add the water to rinse it off
will not lather if you mix it with water like typical washes
this stuff will melt it all off
it can be a little greasy
then i put a wet cloth and wash off everything.
i do go in with some lancome make up oil cleanser for my eyes because i don't rub the boscia remover too much in my eyes
it does not make your skin oily or strip it of moisture like some other cleansers
whereas 2 pumps was better at getting off all my makeup
not drying at all.
i only have to very gently massage my eyes to get it all off
i always follow with another cleanser after to make sure i am squeaky clean
i like how it turns into a face wash when you add a bit of water
this instantly melts your makeup off as soon as you start using it
it's not going to dry out the skin
i can feel the cooling
because this does not foam
i am happy to say that it has not irritated or dried out my skin
found it to be too drying after a while
if you are oily
does not dry my skin out at all
it doesn't take away everything-- i still get the odd pimple
i do know that the non-drying formula means that my face won't overcompensate by producing more oils
the only products that even made a dent in the acne dried me out into a disgusting flaky mess
it does confuse me that it doesn't foam up like other facial cleansers do so sometimes i wonder if it's actually cleansing my face
i read some reviews saying that this dried out your skin
although i still have some dry patches that i have to apply additional moisturizer to
it doesn't dry out your face at all.
really do recommend it to my oily acne prone friends out there
nothing has ever worked to get rid of my acne without drying me out
this formula has never dried out my skin
also didn't dry out my skin
does cause a little dryness, but not too bad.
this doesn't dry my skin
the only thing that i wouldn't give it 5 for stars is it really dried out my skin
i am always very hesitant when it comes to using products that are specifically for acne because they always dry my skin out so bad even though i am oily/combo
this product hasn't made my skin flare up at all or dry it out
i don't want to use harsh products that dry out my skin
as someone with skin on the dryer side
i do notice that my skin is more dry using this
it keeps m skin really clear without drying it
if they ever stop making it i will shrivel up
this is a good cleanser soothin it will work even on dry skin non stripping however will not control oil or get rid of ur black heads maybe good for winter
didn't follow it up with any moisturizers so as not to dampen the effectten days later
the product i was using was drying out my already dry skin
this did not make it drier
this one in particular is my holy grail face wash
it has not dried out my skin
typically every skin product i use either breaks me out or dries me out
it's also not over drying
it foams enough to work well with my clarisonic
i find that it does lather
i will say it doesn't foam
it does not foam up
not dry at all
it has not dried my skin out at all, either.
it doesn't foam like others do it feels more like a gel
she informed me that although it was a good cleanser it just clarified my skin not treated it so she in turn recommended me time realease cleanser
t was a little harsh with everyday use
does not dry my face out at all
though it does not foam or bubble at all
when i do get some small pimples i was my face at night
it is the best wash for late 20's skin.
didn't dry my skin out
because it doesn't have that much salicylic acid
gentle enough on the skin that you can use it every day
i put it on my t zone on dry skin
leaving it super dry
i did notice it started to make my cheeks dry
they made the acne worse or they made my skin peel so badly it literally would flake off
tried it because it wasn't supposed to dry out your skin
i can say this may be the only cleanser i have tried that leaves my face feeling smooth
this face wash does not dry me out, either.
has not dried out my skin
it was so drying on my skin that it caused me to have a chemical burn
doesn't dry out my skin
this isn't dry on my dry-combo skin
it doesn't really get foamy which i think it why it isn't so drying
i don't have to use a leave-on topical treatment anymore
it does not make my face feel oily or too "weighed down"
it doesn't dry out my skin either
does not over dry it
have dry skin that is beginning to lose elasticity
it was too thick or shiny to use under my daily routine products
the first couple of times i think i used too much as my skin was greasy looking
it tends to make me greasy
this is a light formula, not greasy.
as soon as i wash it off
it did not do much for discoloration though.
how are you going to see firming results if your skin is not sagging
sometimes get dry or oily skin
this did not irritate my sensitive skin or make it break out
i actually sunburned when using this
i find that this product is not strong enough for the dryness
my skin tends to get oily during the day
doenst make me extra oily
the rest of my skin is relatively dry
now if i could just get him to wear a decent sunscreen
it has added so much moisture to my face
this moisturizer is a great balance between not drying your skin out nor saturating it
some really oily patches
not does make the oily spots worse
i find this one way better than the sorbet one
my skin doesn't freak out when i apply it unlike other creams i've used in the past
if the winter is very dry
it doesn't show up oily on my skin
with some of my other moisturizers i would still tend to get some dry flakey patches around my forehead
it doesn't break me out or make my already red skin more irritated
my only real complaint is the packaging doesn't get all the lotion out
you can just use the pump straw thing
if it wasn't for fab i'd still be using drugstore products that irritate my skin
which my skin does normally
great for everyday use, will not leave skin oily.
or someone who struggles with sensitive or oily skin
i find that it definitely absorbs super fast into the skin
i do not wake up with oily face in the morning like i normally do
this cream keeps me from getting oily at all
good to use a bit thicker moisturizer at night if you are going through a dry spell
you might like that if you have oily skin
if you need a lot of moisture
my skin was very dry because i was using a cleanser that literally stripped away all the good oils
it didn't make my face oily
i don't have to do my makeup again throughout the day because my face doesn't get oily with this moisturizer
first of all, i have oily skin.
hours you applied it to your skin
it does not make my face feel oily.
it also got me through the crazy dry skin months of winter
does not leave the skin greasy
my t-zone was still getting oily pretty fast
oil-prone aging skin that still needs real moisture
doesn't leave a greasy look
doesn't irritate my skin at all
you only need a little pump of this cream
i feel by using this in conjunction with cover fx mattifying primer that they control my oily skin during my long 10 hour days
it gives the perfect amount moisture without being heavy
i think people with really dry skin will not like this because it is a bit on the light side
doesn't leave my face greasy either.
its not heavy for my oily skintype.
it really is great to balance out skin that has been abused with all different kinds of heavy messy moisturizers
the down side is that it does not contain sunscreen
this cream is great on my skin even in hot summer heat
i cant use it during the day because it makes my skin much to oily throughout the day :
then you'll notice right away that this lotion has them
i do end up getting oil slicks in patches as a result of this moisturizer
my t-zone doesn't get out of control greasy
i think it has more to do with the weather than the actual moisturizer itself
not sure if it might be too much moisture for me in the summer
hoping this is going to be my go to body cream for my dry skin
it doesn't enhance my skin or work very well in the colder months
does not make you oily
perfect for oily skin even in summertime!
i would recommend this to anyone struggling to find a moisturizer that moisturizes their skin without making them oily or mattifying them to the point where they're too dry
i love this stuff because i don't have to dig my fingers in a jar
i love that the metal ball in this always stays ice cold no matter where i store it
my eyes were very dry underneath because of the winter environment
it doesn't appear to leave a film causing issues with foundation or powder
this product does not dry out
not greasy at all
don't really need eye cream
if you need moisture in the under eye are
even better, it doesn't irritate my eyes further.
use something more potent at night so you don't need to worry about your makeup applying well over it or it making your eyes water
quick moisture is what you need than go for it
the cool roller does feel nice under the eyes
i normally have dry skin
this formula does not dry out my under eyes
i feel like this refreshes about as much as any other cream
since i love the heavier cream so much
this soothing eye depuffing roller is just what i needed
i definitely would recommend this soothing serum to anyone who has big bags under their eyes
it's great to keep in the fridge to give it some more anti-puff boost
it got 4 stars because cool teabags would achieve the same result
it feels a little sticky for a minute
once it sinks in it makes my undereye area really soft
even before adding concealer they look way better than when i wake up
i need to use lotion with it as well or my eyes feel a little tight
don't waste your money on any other serum
it is obvious the day i don't use it when my skin becomes uneven looking
it may be a bit heavy for warmer weather esp.
i do live in a dry climate
this heavy stuff + the lightweight moisturizer mixed together make it so that i don't have to rub too hard
it is one of the few products that don't irritate my skin
you feel it missing from your skin routine
"youth-ify" my skin without making it too dry or too greasy like most other products
it does feel a little thick
i felt like i had put too much powder on
this product does not burn, sting or irritate.
dry skin this should definitely be splurge for you
this serum has flat out done work on my skin.
it stays kind-of greasy
it definitely doesn't dry me out
a little goes a long way -- apply to damp skin to stretch it a little
i tend to have oily skin
everything makes me either break out or flake.
although i have no problem with dry spots within my t-zone other areas of my face tend to look dry in any season
it is very light and not greasy at all.
i've always been on the more oily side of combination skins so the sudden change in my skin thpe really threw me off
can get very dry at times
i only hesitantly use this in the am because the formula is very oily
it takes about 2 hours for it to fully soak into my skin
the formula is different from the sorbet so make sure you get the correct one
yes it does leave your skin a touch oily
great for someone with dry to normal skin.
whenever i used a moisturizer it would irritate it even further
it doesn't dry out or absorb fast.
i typically have dry skin in the winter
only mildly dry in the spring
secondly it started to make my skin appear oily as the weather changed
i might buy it again this fall when the weather becomes cold again
my skin isnt dry enough to the extent when it gets flaky
i let it dry a
very good for dry skin in a winter time.
since i live in a dry climate this tends to dry my face quite a bit
i would rather pay that much for soft hydrated skin then get more lines because of the drying of my acne meds that i need
i need all the moisture i can get in this dry phx climate
i could never find a product that would keep my skin moisturized for most of the day
my skin would be flaky or have dry patches.
must have for those with dry skin.
makes my skin feel great even after a long day in the sun
combination skin in this dry winter
no mater how many layers i apply
i didn't really have oily skin to begin with
made the dryness go away
creamy- you can feel the difference right away
it's given my skin a glow.will buy it again.
your skin will drink this up
get rid of the dry patches
not only did it completely heal the dryness overnight
my skin does not feel greasy after application
a must buy for the winter-time skin blues :)
i used this cream in the winter as my skin gets dry
flaky even if i am mostly at home
this works really well for me during winter time when my skin becomes dry
great cream but it is thick, use sparsley
not sticky at all
it's fabulous for my dry skin in a dry climate.
i like that there is spf in it
this product is probably best in the winter when your skin is dryer
good for dry skin best of ll its not oily.
helps prevent my eyes from getting too dry
this eye cream did it for me.
you only need a tiny bit ans it makes your eyes feel refreshed
the skin is never dry anymore
might need something a little bit creamier in the winter time
not too sticky after you use
your under eye area drinks it like water.
as someone with dry skin
i like it because it's a nice compromise between eye creams that are thick
cant put it under my eye concealer or else it will start to get lumpy
i like this item alot leaves a cooling after putting it on
i needed something that would moisturize the area around my eyes because they were ridiculously dry
i think because of the weather
it does not burn or irritate.
not hydrating enough for me to use just this at night
i always have trouble w/ the skin around my eyes: almost everything makes them burn
didn't make my eyes water
occasionally i can even use this on my lips
did not do anything to decrease the look of my fine lines from dryness
does not burn my skin
it does seem to absorb quickly.
could keep the product from drying out
the jar design does make it annoying to get at the cream towards the last 25% or so
will be tough once i use more of the product to keep the scooper clean
does not feel sticky or thick
only thing is the creams sort of stings my sensitive skin for a few seconds
not too oily or heavy
this is the only product that i can use all over my face without clogging pores
i needed something that would hydrate my eyes becuase i noticed that once i began to wear more eye makeup
eye cream that wont make my make up run
this serum seemed to just even everything out.
it just seems to help on a cellular level "clean" your skin thoroughly
although i feel like if you are combo/oily
i don't experience oiliness during the day like i did before
it doesn't leave an oily residue after putting it on
it does have a lot of alcohol in it which is irritating to skin
so you still need to use your regular serum with this
i can immediately see my skin brighten after i apply this
i usually just put them in the refrigerator
i let that dry
it will help your skin repair itself quicker
i need around 2-3 pumps to cover my whole face.
noticed that my skin didn't feel oily by lunch
normally i'm oily by 10am
by the end of the day, i'm still not oily.
said "your skin doesn't look oily at all"
thought i would slather on some of this "potion" while i was doing my usual kid-in-a-c
i may buy that for the weekends when i don't wear air brush dior
just get a nice brush so you don't waste it.
i also love that it didn't burn my skin
i buy dior capture totale one essential every winter or whenever my skin needs a pick-me-up
even when i put a lot of this product on my eyes it didn't leave me with skin problems that come with other creams from over hydration
it leaves a not-too-wet
not-too-dry just-right surface on which to apply my other products
it actually made my skin a bit more oily than usual
i don't get oily as quick
my skin breaks out less
the bad reviews were mostly about the alcohol content in that it might cause dryness etc
my skin tends to break out even more in the winter because of the dryness
in this cold weather my skin tends to get very dry or oily
doesn't dry my face.
it was gentle enough that i felt like it washed remaining makeup residues off my face
thick lather that it ends up lasting a lot longer than any other cleansing foam i've ever used
i like my skin doesn't feel tight or dry
is not at all greasy
my skin doesnt feel oily at the end of the day
does not make my combination skin oily
if i keep it on too long it seeps in my eyes
to the people saying this smells nasty/like fish/like "sewage": you may want to take your jar back because you must have a bad batch
it caused extremely dry
from being so dry
i can't wait till my eyes are completely healed
i can start using this as my regular eye cream
i want something good to prolong the aging for the skin around my eyes
cannot do without it or the cold plasma for my face
this cream was light enough to use on my eye lids without causing them to break out in a rash or feel greasy
its a strange almost tacky consistency that doesn't soak right into the skin
some don't work, some dry out your skin.
all you do is lightly touch the tip of your finger to the cream
the little jar lasts a long time.
i love that i can put it on my eye lids.
giving it a few minutes to absorb--this way you get extra hydration
cold plasma eye took care of that too
i find the smell to be much less intense than the original cold plasma
my only complaint is that it does not provide enough moisture for my dry/sensitive eyes
this eye cream doees everythhing i want it too
not in a drying way
you shouldn't be slathering this product on under your eyes
this cream may smell like a dead fish left on a hot s
don’t mind wearing it in the daytime whereas i can only use the cold plasma face at night because it smells so badly
it seems to make my other creams more potent or somehow work better
i love the feel of cold plasma on my eye
i just don't know if it's that much better than just using the regular cold plasma for the face around the eyes
i'll probably just go for the cold plasma for the face on my eyes
there is no fish smell to either this or the face product
once you try the cold plasma eye
it can make the skin look a little dewey
it will pill up if you rub too much
it also doesn't break out my sensitive skin.
this product has made me forget that i have dry skin
a lot of reviewers are claiming that this is either too greasy or heavy
perfect sun protection out here in the mojave desert
you must protect your skin with that spf.
i find the the cream goes on smoothly with less shine compared to others
tend to dry out or irritate the skin
not sticky, feels great on and i don't spf cream.
it is heavy and has a lot of spf.
after dried it is really nice
have repurchased because i need the intense moisture that the red fab lotion didn't give me
doesn't make my skin too oily
i can see how people may find it too greasy/oily if you already have oily skin however it is mostly perfect for mine which is slightly dry
it also doesn't burn when you apply it like some lotions with spf have done to me in the past
you can burn easily
it's much much better than clinique's moisture defense spf 20 which is too heavy
it is a little stingy if it gets too close to your eyes
the only stuff people put on in the sun was oil
which is unfortunately very dry
my only concern is if it will have enough moisture for me during the nyc winter weather
however, it is oily.
a little squeeze on your index finger is enough to cover your whole face
this is for people who are dry or extremely dry.
don't have to look sticky all day to get the moisture i need
t probably is too heavy for people with oilier skin
my face never feels oily any more.
either my face was to oily or i'd end up with horrible breakouts
it does not read white or ashy.
and it also works perfectly in hot weather, too.
i never feel dry when i use this.
i want the sun protection
so putting on powder/blush right away can be tricky
my face is either super super oily or extremely dry
it is oily on my face.
the wind does nothing to my face
i don't feel chapped or have dry patches anywhere
doesn't make my skin oily
when i put on just the right amount it doesn't make my oily areas even more oily looking
still effective at keeping dry skin
i tend to get dry in the cold weather
it has ingredients that are actually good for your skin
it does not irritate or make the skin break out at all
it is not greasy
the spf doesn't get in my eyes
it absorbs well and does not feel greasy at all.
when the weather changes i get horrible dry patches on my face
it does everything a moisturizer should have except cook you dinner
this would be great for the dry winters
doesn't dry out your skin like some others do
i got a sample to make sure it wouldn't explode my face with breakouts
i don't get coarse skin from sunshine like i do if i wear less sunblock
i love how it glides over my skin without me having to rub my face too hard
i like that it doesn't feel like spf on my skin
it moisturizes while not causing me to break out like most other products
just enough to prevent dry skin
it has a light scent thats not overpowering at all which i also good for my sensitive skin
i do however like to use a thicker cream at night before bed
i wouldn't recommend boscia's lotion for people with dry skin types because the formula wouldn't give them enough hydration
but it does miracles to oily, combination types!
i do get pimples often enough for me to be frustrated with their constant appearance
thought i'd switch to the clear complexion moisturizer to see if it'd help more
you don't notice it once its absorbed
great for oily break out prone skin.
it can have a tendency to dry my skin out a little in drier weather
it did not dry my skin out or make it oily.
my face has the tendency to become oily within a few hours of washing it
you only need a tiny bit to cover your entire face
if your skin gets a little dry just add a few drops of jojoba oil to it
instead it moisturizes my skin just enough without being oily
with the cold weather
i feel like i need more to keep my skin from drying out
i noticed that my face was a little drier after my wash routine
i recommend this moisturizer simply because it doesn't feel heavy on my face
it's the only lotion i've tried that i feel like controls my oily yet maturing skin
this one does not leave my skin oily
my only problem with this moisturizer is that it dries me out a bit when it's so cold that we turn the heat on inside
dry me out a bit when i use this
'll likely just deal with the drying
especially for the dry
didn't make me oily
it feels a little filmy on my skin when i wash it off
if i didn't rinse it off thoroughly enough my skin started to feel a little itchy after drying
just make sure to not use the recommended full one pump or you'll have to drown your face in the sink like me :d
this product is so gentle i actually exchanged it for something "stronger" because i felt like it wasnt cleansing my skin enough
wonderful for those who want an acne wash that won't dry out their skin
it has done wonders for my oily skin
this face wash helps them clear up waaay faster than on their own i definitely recommend it
does not strip or dry out the skin
not dry at all
doesn't dry out my skin
nothing has helped me oily combination skin like this one product
never tight or dry
is soothing when i do get a breakout
this one did not making me feel tight or dried out
i need to like wipe with pressure on my h
being too harsh during cleansing is the worst possible thing you can do for your skin
for when my skin is feeling congested/oily aka all the time
not in that bad squeaky clean way
they always make me too dry
seem to be drying up
i love that it doesn't have harmful chemicals in it
i still find that i will get a small pimple here
i also dod feel dry after each wash whoc o thpught was a good thing
you can feel the clay removing the oil from your face
goes easily on your face
this hasn't dried it out at all
i would recommend this product to anyone who's looking to get rid of acne without drying out their face
doesn't dry it out
your skin is oily in your t-zone
normal/dry everywhere else then this cleanser may be for you
it was not irritating or drying
does not dry your skin out
have to keep my skin care simple
thinking that it would dry my skin out
being a clay cleanser i was hesitant at first thinking it would severely dry my skin out
doesn't dry out your skin
i liked the fact it didn't completely strip my skin of all moisture
because no one likes dry
i've tried a variety of products to try to get my oily-combination skin to clear up
it is not drying
though your skin may take a bit of getting used to it
the texture will take some getting used to as it is very thick
doesn't leave any residue
thinking they will dry my skin out farther
this cleanser is not meant to take make up off
i cannot use this cleanser more than once a day as it is too much for my sensitive skin
dry off my face with a towel then apply it to my dry face
as such does not foam up
at first it feels like it's not cleaning anything because the texture is a bit oily
even though the product itself feels a little oily
your skin feels like ph restored as apposed to when using other cleaners it makes your skin feel dried out
if it bugs you i never seem to notice it after my shower
tends to get dried out with certain products
they all made me really oily
it does not dry my skin out
i think using a cloth has better results than simply splashing water on your face
i just think they are not used to the fact that this cleanser doesn't strip your skin of its essential moisture so feels like there it still stuff on your skin
i get compliments on my skin often
because they are foaming
or in the mornings if my face is a little oily from serums working their magic overnight
i find that it doesn't strip the skin at all
this is a great cleanser for the mornings when you don't want to dry out your skin
it definitely will not wash off make-up.
i find that this cleanser gets rid of any oil that i have
my skin is no longer oily and easily irritated.
the bottle does not lie when it says it will calm my skin
immediately after washing your face you might feel some of the cleanser still on your skin
make sure you follow the directions when using this product: wet h
apply on dry face to get the best results
makes me think i'm getting a facial twice a day!
i do use a couple of drops of josie maran argan oil on my face after washing with this
to ensure my skin isn't too dry
this is definitely not for dry skin
this product will just make you drier
my skin does suffer from break outs
it does not irritate my skin nor does it cause my skin to become dryer
i never used to bother washing my face
caudalie didn't seem to get my skin clean
it doesn't dry my combo skin out
other cleansers always either dried out my skin horribly or were so greasy that i'd break out worse
i guess it was just pulling all the gunk out
it is not greasy at all
i get dry in some areas
only thing is it might not be moisturizing enough if youre super dry
as it can boost moisture where i need it when i am combating breakouts
it does make me a bit oily
you often get those chunks of lotion
i swear my skin has never been this soft or clear
if you do an entire pump you will be rubbing it into your face for quite some time
it'll just get extra smooth
the t-zone is still getting oily during the day while the rest of my face is feeling a bit dry
i do notice that my skin isnt as oily using this product
the clay cleanser actually works better if you leave it one for 5-10 minutes
it will just dry out my skin
my skin was not oily at all
i would not recommend it for dry skin because i find it doesn't fully make my skin feel moisturized
this is not drying
a little goes a long way with this gel cream so use sparingly
i don't even use a full pump otherwise i'm sitting there rubbing my face forever just to get it rubbed in
i feel that it helps to keep any blemishes at bay or for any that showed up overnight
this cream is also on the oily side.
whenever i get zits the worst side effect for me is how red they get
the skin around them gets
you have to kind of spread it to the areas of your face
however in the mornings its really bothersome having dry skin until i get home
more importantly this didn't clog my pores or make me breakout at all
so much so that i can't really wear makeup because it making the flaking even more obvious
find it helps in putting moisture back into skin that may be removed from cleansing
it might not be quite thick enough as a pm moisturizer to deal with the flaking
my only problem is that it burns mt eyes if it gets too close
use that too since i'll get very dry during canadian winter
without making my t-zone look greasy
you have to warm it with the tip of your fingers before you applied in your under eyes
refreshing to treat your skin while you sleep this is it
i really like this gel because its moisturising enough without feeling too heavy on my skin
i've had so much trouble finding a moisturizer that wasn't greasy for my oily skin
i'll probably move on to find something a little more hydrating like the vita line
it didn't make me oily
they were too drying for me
while this doesn't provide a lot of moisture
it is not drying
i found it soaked in too quickly to use as a night cream/treatment
usually clearing up skin requires getting worse before getting better
i live in a very cold
after i apply it i feel like my skin drinks it in immediately
this is a great product to use if you have oily blemish prone skin
can be used instead of a moisturizer if you get oily skin during the night
so finding a night cream that hydrates during the winter cold while not feeling greasy has been a challenge
i'd recommend this to anyone who needs extra moisture during cold/dry weather
even when i have no breakouts i still use it as it leaves my skin smooth
it even control my skin under times of stress
this has cleared up my complexion in a little less than a month without drying out my skin or making it over oily
tip: if your skin is really dry
not to mention the metal rollers felt great against my skin
as i have dry combination skin
it does not dry out my skin at all
this is made worse with the dry air of winter.
when my skin is dry like this
the outside is now smooth enough where i can put concealer on it
the night cream i usually use became really expensive
does not work well with liquid foundation because u r pulling on the skin taking away the effect
my usual skin care routine just couldn't keep everything under control
i pretty much tried everything aside from peeling my skin off
live in a dry climate so when i get a breakout i don't need a dry out
the reason i gave this product four stars instead of five is because it was a bit hard to peel off unless you use a thick amount to fully cover your skin
it didn't take out as much pore gunk as i thought
you have to use a lot for it to peel well
i can see my pores have gotten smaller
out of your skin when you peel of this black mask is soooo satisfying
it'll leave your skin pretty red after taking it off
make sure you put on a decently thick layer
otherwise it'll be a pain to pull off
it's an intense mask that you must apply a thick layer to work properly
it takes forever to dry
the mask doesn't take long to dry
my suggestion is to make sure to put a thick
my boyfriend was disappointed that it didn't have the effects of peel off masks that appear to rip out all white
it didn't get as many blackheads as i thought it would
either it doesn't dry all the way
have to wash it off
it doesn't take to long to dry
would recommend to people with oily skin.
this product did not irritate or flush my skin
it actually feels quite cooling as it dries.
it also doesn't hurt the skin when you peel it off
if you want to have to have any blackheads pulled out
this mask is a waste of your time
let it dry a little longer
even though i didn't put on an "opaque" layer as the directions told me to
it was only a little difficult to peel off
though i did have to rub at the areas of my face that had a particularly thin layer of product in order to get it to peel off
my face is very oily when i wake up
feel like your skin will be off with it then rise it with cold water
this is not the cheap chemical base junk from instagram where you see girls crying
it is meant to naturally clear your skin overtime through the use of charcoal
this mask is used to keep your skin clear
it does pull some fine hairs off of your face if you use it on cheeks
a tip to or break out is to run cold water over your face to close up the pores or put ice on your face
don't write it off completely before trying the baking soda
i really wanted a peel off mask
it doesn't pull out blackheads like some of the other peel off masks you see online
those ones are like putting super-glue on your face
it does hurt in some areas to peel off lol
feel like there's always that extra dead skin layer
where there is residual left on your face
this is also great if you want to remove some of that crazy peach fuzz
seemed to "slick" over areas when peeling up as if it wasn't completely dried
if you eat more healthy
it doesn't take out blackheads like it promises
especially if you have a lot of blackheads on your nose like i do
i sometimes use this mask on my t-zone
decided to try it again using a very thick coat
you need to let it dry for around 45 mins to get the maximum blackheads removed
it's just not enough moisture for my dry winter skin
blackheads allowing your face to breath for a whole new feel-good life
i wanted something to give my skin a natural glow without being oily
does not make my skin look oily
recommend it to people with dry skin
it literally gets all the junk out if my skin
sometimes with peel off masks it's hard to get the right amount on your face
for oily skin it didn't make me oily at all in my t zone or greasy so thats a plus
it just didn't help the dry patches which it claims to help
not that well in my oily areas
i needed something that was going to hydrate my skin enough to last all day
when i apply this to my skin
almost like what a glass of ice cold water feels like when you are really parched
this is one of the only moisturizers that provides the right amount of moisture without breaking me out
my skin didn't dry out terribly while on accutane though
has fast absorbing lasting moisture that doesn't break out sensitive skin like many other products
it is one of the only moisturizers you will find that doesn’t feel like it is just setting ontop of your face
luckily i am neither oily nor dry skinned so this was everything i expected
said it would be great for my dry skin
it also prevents sunburn on those after work runs or time outside
my combination skin gets dry in certain areas
not only are my normally dry areas healed with daily use
the finish is not too shiny once applied
it has a good texture where it's not too thick or too thin
all of the sudden my skin was dry
when i tried to moisturize heavily i would break out
i felt i needed something like a cold glass of water on a very hot summer's day to quench the thirst
this is the best i've ever tried in moisture.
it doesn't burn when applying under your eyes.
my only dislike is that it seems to make my skin feel dry when combined with bb cream that also has spf
humid that i find that its a welcome relief
i do a clarisonic cleaning so everything just soaks in
really don't break from my routine in fear of breakouts
i no longer have the dry patches
not liquid, but not a super heavy cream, either.
even on driest skin that i get
a moisturizer that doesn't feel like i've got concrete on my face
totally addicted to rich moisturizer without being heavy or greasy
it is rich so maybe not for oily skin?
normally i don't like spf products bc i always feel like they leave an annoying residue behind
not too heavy, not too light.
i don't need an additional moisturizer under it except in the winter when it gets cold
there is no greasiness to it
not sticky on my dry skin
i need more moisture than i used to.
with combo skin try applying very lightly
this is the only one i can slather on with no worries of break outs
my skin is incredibly dry in the wintertime
this is one great product with spf for day moisture
i think it is good for cold weather.
if you use too much it feels sticky
mportant these days to protect your skin
tend to get oily in the t-zone as the day goes on
my skin tends to break out
so many times i can only spot treat with stuff like that because it makes my sensitive skin break out
you must let dry or a little sticky.
doesn't irritate my skin while it provides just the right amount of moisture
doesn't leave any residue
i never feel tight or dry anymore
my skin is never dry anymore
doesn't leave any residue or smell behind after applying
it works amazingly on my wrinkles i got from too much sun exposure
not at all greasy
i would say it evens out my skin tone
i highly recommend this product if you suffer dry skin during the colder seasons as i do
i'd like to start using it on my whole face because so many customers love the texture transformation that occurs
the thing that needs to be said is this is not for discoloration
very light weight and not greasy at all.
if your skin is dry
if you use it on your eye lids they can get too swollen
to take care of my skin
my skin is kind of oily especially on the summertime
this product does not irritate my skin at all
not oily and only takes a little.
you only use a few drops.
er part of my mixed ethnicity allows me to get away with being in the sun without getting burnt
this does not dry out
irritate or make my skin more oily
does not cause any weirdness when covered with a moisturizer
the consistency is not greasy or gross
"your skin is so glowy" "your skin looks so healthy" "what did you do to your face?"
i wanted something to do daily that would help prevent aging while giving my skin a little bit of moisture
do add a certain something to your skin care regimen
it's the best i have found to keep my very dry under eye area moist overnight
just moisturizing doesn't seem to be enough anymore
if sun damage is your main issue
doesn't leave skin greasy
remember to wear an spf with this product or you might cause more damage
at the side of my mouth that wouldn't go away with regular skin cream
it leaves skin soft without feeling like somthing is pulling your skin
this isn't one of those eye creams you can just dab or wipe on right out of the bottle
since your skin does all of its repairing while you sleep
this cream doesn't seem good for oily skin.
i would describe it was thick
however, it doesn't pull at my skin at all.
this cream feels great once you pat it in to the under eye area
it's very hard to apply it because it has a thick shea cream type consistency
plus the cream is so thick i only need a fraction of what i'd normally use
i can see this jar lasting at least 2x longer than my previous eye creams
keep reapplying more often every time i see fine lines
the cream is very rich, so you use only a little.
i keep extra tubs just incase they run out!
my skin has been dryer than normal
tend to get dry patches
has given me extra protection for winter winds
the product is very thick so you only need a little
it will appear very greasy
will never use another eye cream!
because it is a thick paste you think you are applying less with this method than you actually are
it just 'melted' into your skin
ten minutes after applying this i cannot stop touching my undereye area because it is fascinatingly baby-soft
since i hit 30 have tried everything from drugstore to la mer to olive oil trying to keep my under eyes moist overnight
in the past i've found them to leave my skin too dry
made my dry skin not be as dry
thin enough to feel it sink in your skin
but once i apply it, its not oily at all.
this is the only moisturizer that actually helps my extremely dry skin without making me break out
nor did it make my skin too oily
definitely less than the amount of toothpaste you would normally use
dry skin is never fun.
i can handle oily, but i can't handle dry.
i can still feel the moisture when i press into my skin
heavier products like this usually break me out
can get dry through the day
when i first bought this i was scared it would be overly hydrating
over all i like it i just wish it was slightly more hydrating in a gel form
for me it really was worth it because i have combo skin with dry patches under my eyes
it is not greasy at all
the biggest perk of this moisturizer for me is that it doesn't feel too slick or unnatural
it was not rich enough for me in the winter
after long flights which really dry out my skin
short of surgery there's really no way to be rid of either however this cream has softened them
they always leave my skin dry
it doesn't leave my skin greasy
scaly patch on my face that i just couldn't get rid of
big bonus if i can use it for eye cream too
i love that it didn't leave my face greasy
it's the perfect amount of moisture without feeling heavy
the dry desert weather in arizona this makes it a lot drier especially during the cold winter months
definitely recommend it for those with dry skin!
my skin can get s dry from being outside in the winter
when the artist used this moisturizer underneath my makeup i knew it'd probably end up being my next big beauty purchase
with the colder months going on i knew it was a little drier than normal
say if makes you face greasy
apply it right after washing your face before you go to bed to get your face used to it
because if your face isn't used to a lot of natural moister
i will say it's the only moisturizer that has done the job for my skin i have very very dry skin
this really hydrates it really well through out my day
let it sit around for a week or two because i am pretty scared of moisturizers since my pores are easily clogged
while it dries it can feel a bit heavy
my dry patches from a breakout cleared without overdoing my oily spots
my skin drinks it right up leaving it smooth
you can feel the moisture all day
skin that tends to be dry
my skin has become more dry everywhere
for those of us with combination or oily skin
i layer my skin with it sometimes even 3 times a day
provides just enough moisture for the dry winter months
it is rich without being heavy or greasy.
also doesn't make my skin breakout.
then i'll use this on spots that are extra dry for an extra boost of moisture
it's usually difficult for me to find a moisturizer that works for me because i have combination skin that breaks out easily
dries out easily during fall/winter too
the dry areas are dry
i continued to use it throughout the cold dry canadian winter because it was the only thing i found to hydrate enough to remove flakiness
in the summer i tend to be more oily
although i really have to blot to make sure i don't look like a grease ball
it doesn't completely absorb into skin either
not oily or heavy
doesn't feel sticky or oily
not for those with oily skin
i would say my skin is average- not too oily
in winter i always prefer a thicker moisturiser
really does quench my dry skin
have really dry skin
it's ideal if you have dry skin as it adds moisure
doesn't make your skin feel oily
after 2 days i could put on makeup with out worrying about flaky dry skin
no more dry flaky skin when i put on my foundation
love this cream, very rich but not sticky.
it gives me great moisture without being greasy
i don't get any more flakes
as close as giving your skin a long cool drink of water as you'll ever get
i highly recommend it for ladies with dry skin or simply following a harsh/drying peel
that i had to start using a powder to use less shiny
does an awesome job replenishing the moisture over night
it have trouble with products leaving a greasy film on my skin
i like to use it as my second cleansing step because it's so milky
gentle cleaner is just the thing anytime
have a normal to dry skin
you can just rub some on your dry face
twice pump is enough for one wash.
i just can't seem to stay away from this cleanser
or you will have to wash your face once to get product off
doesn't leave a filmy residue if it gets on your eyes a little
know i'm not putting any unnecessary chemicals on my face
it can be used wet or dry.
although it doesn't foam up like i am used to
my face doesn't dry out
even though it seems like the product is absorbed into the skin before you can even clean it
you just have to trust that there is still product on your skin when cleansing it
great for normal, dry or combination skin.
both work for my extremely dry skin in humid south florida
i sit under an air vent at work that blows cold air all day long
i could see dry to normal or normal to combo get greasy
i get a little more oily in the summer
wouldn't recommend for anyone with oily skin
it doesn't make my t-zone more oily
it also last a very long time if you're feeling dry
it never flaked until i used this
now if you have normal to dry this might not be enough moisturizing
it's not as extreme as any east coast temps
my skin is so dry after i wash it
i feel like all the moisture is restored when i put this on
it worked just as great on my dry skin as it did on my oily skin
this is the perfect base before makeup if you have dry skin
i usually get dry patches
as someone with combination-oily skin
not only with non greasy skin
since it is thicker, you don't need a lot.
my face is way less oily in the morning
they give the skin so much moisture
acne prone this is the perfect moisturizer it doesn't leave u feeling oily or feels heavy on the skin after i wash my face no matter how much lotion i put my skin feels tight
i can have seriously dry skin
however may be too heavy for full foundation afterwards a daytime moisturizer made for cold nyc winters
creams would either make my chin area dry out
i also find that it works best if you dab it on
sometimes i put powder on right away
applying any sort of foundation leaves my face dry
you only have to dab on a little for it to do its job
it used to be that i'd have to keep re-applying creams because my skin kept drying out
doesn't take a lot for it to evenly spread on my face
it goes into my combination skin super quickly
ok, so i have extremely dry skin year round.
in the winter i have flaky peeling skin in my t zone
which i can never get rid of no matter how much i moisturize
no more dry skin
i still have dry skin after washing my face
is not oily at all
prior to using it i could never find anything that would keep my face moisturized without being greasy
something in this cream was burning my skin
while going through chemo my skin changed from combination to dry dry dry
am taking meds so my skin is still very dry
i'll keep using it as long as my skin stays dry
this winter when i developed a couple of extermely dry patches on my face that my regular moisturizers couldn't relieve
does not cake up on the skin like thick creams often do
the smelll does not linger
before using this amazing face cream my skin would have terrible dry patches during the cold weather
dry fast, non sticky at all.
moisturized yet you do not feel any gunk/film/sticky ickiness on your face
it is never greasy
the glow that i get from bobbi brown's cream is all what i need
can use just a little in warm weather
it is non-greasy
still gives you the moisture that you need especially now that winter is almost here
this hydrates my dry spots wonderfully without being greasy or oily in any way
i just have to find the right combination to layer
to combat this i've used various treatments that have dried out my skin in that area a lot
this is perfect for anyone with dry skin
eye cream you can imagine from $20-$100+
i get very dry skin around my eyes in the winter time
nothing helps my dry winter skin like this
one major thing i like about it though is that it smoothes out the fine lines near my eye bags so that when i apply makeup it looks more flawless
if you're just going for a more flawless eye finish or you have the problem of seeing wrinkle lines after finishing makeup
the bags are controlled when i didn't get enough sleep
the product is not oily at all
it does not appear greasy or have an oily finish
you only need to dab on a very small amount
i expect the tub to last me a very long time.
a 52$ eye cream just doesn't sit well with me
no make up days without all that extra stuff that comes with many other eye creams
if you want a basic eye cream that will dry fast
wait a bit for everything to sink into my skin
not too heavy or greasy!
it did not make my under eyes feel so oily like some
once the colder months roll around my skin gets so dry
it is the only eye cream that will get rid of the dryness completely
recommend it to anyone prone to dry skin during these colder months
i didn't use anything beneath my eyes besides my daily face lotion
i keep it in my refrigerator for when i use it so that it's cold
i don't tend to need "hydrating" since i have far from dry skin
although this is not thick at all
i usually throw this in my skin care routine around the summer months when they don't need too much care
i like putting this in the fridge for a little
absorbs fast enough that i can put on my makeup moments later
this doesn't sting or burn
it takes forever to really soak in.
it does moisturize better than many others i have tried
this is the only eye cream that doesn't burn
it doesn't feel heavy or greasy
some eye creams leave me feeling like i have something tacky or sticky sitting on top of my skin
it absorbs easily so it is great for daytime.
it goes on a little dry
does a good job of hydrating your under eye area so well that the fine lines are less noticeable
knew that i needed too cause my under eye was so dry that it would start flaking when i would put concelor on
i highly recommend this for everyone with a normal to oily skin type
oil right off your face
especially in the summer because it is perfect to get all the oil off your face
even if my face gets a bit dry when i use it during winter
i'd still have to run some cleansing water over my face
it doesn't dry my out skin at all
doesn't leave my skin dry
it is not drying
not over dry when you're done
makes you face feel clean does'nt irriate my sensetive skin love the way it really really foams
this is the only face wash that i actually ordered a second one after i was done with me first in my whole entire life i always switched half way through beacuause either they had too much moisture too drying too much fragrance stipped my skin
does not dry out skin at all
i am using bobbi's cleansing oil right now as it is cold
it can product a lot of bubbles which i like a lot
never tight or dry
since i use it in the shower i seldom take my clarisonic brush in the shower with me
at the end of the day i was simply adding a small amount of hydration to my skin
i let it sit on my face until my skin absorbs it.
i only use it at night because i have oily skin.
my skin is usually a little oily/combination type
is a little bit drying
this stuff keeps my skin moisturized yet doesn't break me out
that is pretty awesome because even lotions meant for treating acne can tend to break me out
take a bit longer to sink in
as it gets cooler out
it can by drying it used alone.
does not clog pores nor needs much time at all to be absorbed into being the perfect makeup base
1 1/2 pumps is all you need to cover your face
there is in fact some sort of sun protection
who's wanting to spend $50 on a moisturizer with spf that needs to be applied ever 3 hrs to turn around
doesn't feel heavy or sticky
have always struggled to find a lotion that didn't make my oily skin oilier
doesn't add any excess oil to my oily areas
when you clean your skin
i love knowing that i’m protected from the sun with the spf 15
it absorbs so completely that nobody can tell that i’ve got the lotion on
i would highly recommend that everyone use a sunscreen because i just had a tiny spot removed from my face
i actually set this with powder before using other makeup on warmer days so my make up lasts
i am so so oily
when the weather gets colder
for reference, i have normal, sometimes dry skin.
kind of keep my oils at bay
being more oily in my t-zone
i get shiny in general since i have oily skin
by that it makes some type of layer inbetween your skin
i no longer have to deal with dry skin patches
want to look into other bobbi brown products as well
this does not irritate my skin
not greasy at all.
usually my moisturizers cause my foundation to break apart even with proper primer
leaves my foundation on without getting oily
it doesn't leave me oily at all
it's light yet still hydrating without leaving a residue
it works for my dry skin during the winter months for those of us who live in higher elevations
it has such a cooling feel on my face.
my face is combination/dry
use it in my drier areas to give it a bit of moisture
during winter it gets really really dry
as someone with oily/combination skin
sticky or slippery -ready for makeup
so good if you have oily/combination skin
a lot of products break me out because of my sensitive skin
have never been able to consistently use a moisturizer without breaking out or feeling like my skin can't breathe
it doesn't absorb so much as to feel like it isn't moisturizing your face
not too thick works well as a primer
we shall see if it is hydrating enough for winter
dry in certain areas
was worried it wouldent work for me since it's intended for oily or combo skin
almost every moisturizer i have tried has made my skin turn into a grease ball
someone with very oily skin this is a ride or die piece in my collection for sure
makes skin appear even without it
i go all day without looking oily
as someone growing up with terrible oily
would definitely recommend it for those with uneven skin tones or if you want a dewy finish when applying makeup
it is rich but not greasy or heavy.
it is hard for me to find a good moisturizer that will hydrate without making me feel greasy or uncomfortable
they either felt sticky, flaky or greasy.
my make up doesnt flake anymore with this used as my base
thought a moisturizing product before my makeup would be a disaster however i was wrong
they're either greasy or thick or hard to rub in.
the jar lasts forever, too!
gives me just the right amount of hydration without breaking out my face
good for skin thats more on the dry side i would say
as someone who has pretty normal skin to slightly dry this primer is a god send
my dry skin ladies will love this!
this product will make you look more oily
my combination skin would start to get shiny by
this primer has more of a sticky feeling
i wish i could rub this all over my whole body because the effect it's had on my very sensitive
it helps my face stay almost shine free compared to an oily mess
without it i wouldn't have found this now staple in my makeup bag
a little goes a long way i use a clean beauty blender to put it on
as i get older my skin is becoming more dry.
at first i was afraid to use this for my combo/oily skin
it seemed to control my oils ok
i realized that it wouldn't keep my face matte throughout the entire day
i almost forgot i had oily skin.
i love how it dries very quickly
i like in a humid hot place so this stuff is perfect for that
be careful if your skin is prone to break-outs
at the same time still good for oily skin
my city is very dry and cold in winter.
lightweight face oil i really enjoy
it applies beautifully to the skin- you can barely feel it when you're wearing it
not greasy at all
i dab it on wind-burned patches or especially dry spots over the balm to keep it from absorbing too fast
this product does not make your face oily or greasy
this oil fixes my dry spots right up without making the oily parts too oily
the design makes it so that you get oil all over the outside of the glass bottle
as i usually just use what is in the lid
always appreciate bb's extra face oil
it does feel a bit oily on topthe skin for just a bit
since i have dry skin
i love that it is in glass rather than plastic
the ks oil did nothing for my severely dry skin.
my skin is normally so dry
i also dont look like freddy kruger anymore in the wintertime from my skin peeling
coconut oil break my face out so bad
therefore causing my skin to create too much
that's not the case with this face oil
when ever my sensitive skin chooses to break out i use this oil to bring my skin back into balance
i can't seem to turn off the heater
which means my skin feels dry all the time now
as if it will be much too oily
that didn't do anything to restore moisture back into my face
your skin has mind of it own depending on your condition
i'd use it at night time after cleaning when you feel especially tight or dehydrated
is great for those days when i am drier than normal
this is a dry oil and it will soak in easily.
you can use it on combo skin
and don't forget your neck and hands!
i've found not every oil suits every type of skin -- i'm in my early 20s
it can get a little messy
i definitely recommed this for people with dry
without greasy feel despite its being an oil
earlier this winter i noticed my foundation would not sit smoothly on my cheeks because of the dry skin
it does not make your skin oily
when it gets really chilly it dries out
the awesome thing about this is that whenever your skin is drying out
you can pat a small amount of it on over your makeup for additional moisture
it doesn't make your skin look greasy or oily.
it didn’t work on my oily skin
think this is probably suited for drier skin types
this cream doesn't irritate them
it leaves them moisturized like none other
this is a must buy for those of us with dehydrated skin
if you get white film
do remember to warm it between your fingers
don't worry about rubbing it in really hard
it seems as though i can never get enough moisture
it is the only eye cream that i have ever used that didn't give me milia or tiny bumps everywhere
anyone with dry skin
the thick cream may be best during cold winter months
at night for anyone with oily skin
it is very rich and thick so i only use at night.
nothing seemed to help until i tried bobbi brown extra eye repair cream
the best part is that my under eyes are moisturized all day with no dry lines
the cream doesn't do anything for dark circles however
make sure you dab under your eyes
don't rub or try to smooth
you need to warm it between your fingers- it will easier apply
even with mineral powder on top of it will still make it look smooth
you must warm between finger tips before applying
i generally take good care of my skin
does look a bit oily
it is not greasy
the only downside is that the full effect diminishes a bit when you remove the residue
let dry before applying foundation
use on dry skin only!
as the product will get crusty if you use to much in one spot
it was peeling so bad that even after make up my skin looked horrible
try to smooth before face is completely dry
i do carry my powder to work as after lunch i freshen up my powder a bit
i apply it with my brush very thinly wait ten minutes or less
if you put it on too thick it will leave white marks on your face
it really does make your wrinkles disappear
splash some water on any of the areas that have a white residue on your skin
the more you dab the more residue you will get!
if you need to blot with water
make sure it is wet
any water left on your face
lastly make sure it dries for about 10 minutes then apply makeup etc
however it tells you on the product that if there is a white residue or film to use water to remove it
dont have terribly wrinkled or damaged skin
i've noticed that even when i wash it off my skin looks so good
i personally am a little hesitant to do the damp cloth because of not wanting to rub the product off the face you pay so much for the product to begin with why waist it
first apply the product let it dry
i get compliments on my skin all the time!!
this is like rest in a tube!
i only gave this 4 stars because of the white residue issue when you use a little too much of this
you will get a white residue
somewhat sticky which made it hard to apply to my face
i will be irritated all day long for those pores
not only does it do a fine job of tightening the wrinkled area
mix with a little water
the consistency is a bit thick so use caution when using alone because it tends to get chalky
powder on top of this or it does not work
close your eyes and fan your face till dry.
can't put on too much because then you have a white chalky look where you put it on
make sure it dries completely
then wasn't allowing it enough time to dry
play with it for a bit because it can leave white buildup that you will need to wipe away
don't let your moisturizer touch it because it will make the white buildup increase
i take care of my skin
after thoroughly letting this product dry i apply smashbox primer
let this product dry thoroughly
be still until it dries
let it all dry thoroughly.
t goes on in an even layer before it starts to dry
if you're skin is too dry, it will turn white.
i do not wash off
once u wash it off
so you won't have the white residue
then you need to wipe off the white dust that appears on your face after it dries
i read other reviews about it leaving a white residue
you splash water on your face
still have make up apply evenly
the only reason this doesn't get five stars is for the white residue when it dries
i wait until the product is dry
it is hard to get the residue off of those areas.
i did have white residue the first time
if i touch it with anything liquid the bags return
the directions on the box say to splash your face with water to get rid of the white residue
it's tough to find products that work well with oily skin in a humid climate
by the way, i have normal to oily skin.
other times are oily
when i wake up or after wash my face i can tell my skin is dry with a lot of dead skin
my tzone is not anywhere near as oily as it used to get
i'll start by saying i have very oily skin
t can get super humid
i get some dry patches sometimes
it's not greasy/oily on my skin at all
i get lazy with applying stuff to my face mainly cause i'm uncomfortable with it feeling sticky or not matte
it's the perfect balance of hydration without making my face look or feel oily
humidity it was taking too long to absorb
note: i have dry skin that breaks out easily
this did not clog my pores although it did not keep me matte it definitely keep me hydrated
very few creams don't make me break out
love it for not being too heavy in the summer heat
but still enough moistures even for the dry skin.
doesn't leave a film or residue on my face
doesn't make it look or feel oily at all after using it
if i'm having a lot of dry patches i pick this up
they make my face feel "fake slippery"
this works very well at giving my oily skin just the right amount of moisture
does not cause my sensitive skin to break out
you can tell it doesn't have any artificial scents in it too which is a plus
only issue is in winter the air is very dry in my house
does not irritate my skin or create an itchy sensation afterwards like some products do on me
especially if you have easily irritated skin issues
but not for normal dry skin.
i still had extreme dry patches the next day
it also mattified my oily parts without drying it
that after using this makes me super greasy
as someone who has really oily skin
doesn't feel sticky after application
i would apply it before my eye cream
not greasy at all
i am not a fan of water so my skin is very dry /oily
the other one made my face too oily if i used it too frequently
yet provides just the write amount of hydration to keep my skin from getting flaky
my face usually gets dry in the winter
doesn't make you feel like it's just piling on more grease --
it didn't irritate my skin either
become very oily no matter what i put on my face
moisture my skin so desperately needed
the serum is kinda sticky once you apply it
id suggest you stay clear from this product if you have oily skin
i think this also really helped with my dry patches
i still use it because i really like the texture
it's perfect to help dry skin during winter.
it didn't irritate my skin at all.
especially because my face has been really dry because it's winter
does not interfere with my tarte foundation
didn't see any change except my skin got very dry
my skin doesn't do well with normal primers
it is the only thing that has helped my dryness this winter
it leaves a film on my skin for a long time
takes care of dry spots better than my thick cream
after about 5 bottles i can say this is a very light moisturizer which allows the skin to absorb it really quick
my oil zone doesn't get too oily from this
i put it on straight out of the shower or after toning my face when the skin is still slightly damp
absorbs nicely so there isn't any stickiness on my pillow when i apply this at night
my whole face just felt so dry i was in desperate need of some moisturizer
it was a little too light for winter use
i feel like this is calming my skin down i just wish it stay wet a little longer
i should note that i have incredibly dry skin.
if it feels sticky, then you used too much.
color goes on great after it's dried a very short time
i really think the sun helps it work on your skin
when i run out i notice my skin becomes more dull
what it does for my skin in the sun
so there's no greasy or oily feeling
it doesn't feel dry or too oily.
didn't leave the skin white
even though i take care of my skin
not greasy at all
i find that most turn greasy in my hot
dont keep rubbing in or it will ball up.
which pretty much makes it the only lotion that doesn't
couldn't get over the greasiness
by the afternoon my face had an oily sheen to it that i just can't live with
hate the smell so this is my attempt at upgrading my skin-care routine
so maybe this would be a winner for people with a little bit drier skin
the only drawback i notice is that if you use to much the product flakes off
made a mess even though i applied very little
thought i should put all this sunshine to good use
"apply generously" does not mean glob it on
i do lose a lot of sleep due to having a baby
i cannot express enough my love for the instant de-puffing roll-on gel
how it soothes away anything visible that you want to hide
it feels so good when applying it under your eyes because of the three little balls on the applicator
especially when you leave it in the refrigerator which i highly recommend
i unknowingly apply too much because the product comes out so easily out of the tube
i did find that it does an excellent job of keeping my eyelids
not at all sticky
this one goes on easily and is fast drying.
it feels like a little mini massage when you apply
your skin will just drink it up
so those with oily skin might want to stay away
the metal roller is probably the biggest reason that i like it
it doesn't leave any kind of sticky
i usually buy really high end skin care
the moisture is there all day truly!
i don't notice that my bags have gotten puffier
it seems like this might actually be helping to fade my scarring
i also love that this doesn't leave behind a residue
it's like my skin has been needing this added moisture all along
i would not use this if you have oily skin
or in areas where you tend to get oily
although it did not clog my pores it did not minimize them
i can immediately feel the difference in my skin once it's absorbed--so soft
which is one thing that the ptr hyaluronic cloud cream that i've been using doesn't do
everything i tried was too greasy or did nothing to keep my foundation from caking
this product is not greasy
it doesn't make your facce feel wet
giving you long time moisture
it doesn't feel bad on my skin like a lot of silicone-y products do
didn't have to use my fingers to keep it more sanitary
being on the plane for so long can make your skin very dry
wouldn't recommend to anyone with oily skin
i live in a very cold city with a great deal of snow
it has helped with my dry patches so much
i find that it really plumps up my skin when i put it on
normally in winter i have very dry skin
this works wonders without making my skin greasy or more breakouts
didn't leave my skin oily
who knew that such a great moisturizer was right under my nose all this time
it also leaves your face so smooth for hours
some areas get dry
my skin doesn't even get a hint of oil in the t zone
supple without making my oily t-zone worse
it doesn't do that gross peeling off thing when i use a primer either which is a problem i tend to have with some moisturizers
fresh that it doesn't irritate my skin
is non-oily/greasy/not heavy
was not sticky or greasy at all
i didn't find it to be greasy at all.
does not leave skin shiny or greasy.
t stays extra clean
this cream made my face feel like a babies bottom
this is the first one that has left my skin soft without the feeling that there's something on it—no tackiness or anything other than smooth skin
doesn't do much to repair damaged skin
usually because of how greasy my face feels in the morning
my face is always dried out
great for summer dry skin.
yes your skin isn't gonna feel moisturized after half an hour
big moisture not so big price.
all moisturizers either make my face red or irritate it real bad
it has worked wonders on my normal to dry skin
it doesn't leave my face oily at all
no breakouts, not too thick nor watery.
not heavy or oily
it is not sticky/greasy
light feel, and wasn't greasy or oily.
it is very light and non greasy, like they say.
my skin can get very dry
i actually have not had any issues with oily skin during the day
have no dry patches or flaky parts
i never use moisturizer because it normally breaks me out-not this one
you figured something out for me to not have dry flakey facial areas or breakouts from moisturizing
is not greasy at all
my skin gets pretty dry in the winter
don't forget to use on your lips before your balm
be sure to only use a tiny bit right after applying face lotion so that it stays smooth
either they are too strong for my sensitivity or they do nothing to moisturize or combat wrinkles
my skin was getting drier than normal
this eye cream does an amazing job tightening up the skin
especially because the container allows you to use all of it instead of most pumps that leave wasted cream where you can't get it
there is a stick applicator because you should put your fingers in the jar
i live in a very dry climate so moisture is king.
when you apply just a tiny amount it feels light
thick, rich and good for dry winter conditions.
even hours later i find myself just touching the areas because they are still so silky soft
didn't make it "ball up" like some eye creams do
too bad the first eye cream i actually like is $110
perfect consistency, not too thick or too light.
only slight complaint is that from am to pm there is a little bit of that crunchy buildup that occurs when you haven't used a pump product in a while
really liked the way how it hydrates my skin making the wrinkles not so apparent
i get very little sleep
i can make it last close to a whole tear being careful to not accidentally over-pump
there is still a load of expensive cream in there that i for one am not willing to toss into the bin
sometimes scaly undereyes that make concealer impossible because everything just dries me up like a lizard
as i keep my stuff in the fridge
not once did my eyes feel dry.
i do notice that when i travel it tends to leak onto the cap
i really like this eye creme you only need a little to use on your eye area
nothing like the heavy sticky one i was using prior
it is not greasy
it was not enough moisture for my eyes
if it just could add more moisture
yet there is still a lot left in the applicator
in the winter i have very dry skin
it's amazing what the little extra moisture in this cream will do
i still really like the cream
you apply the cleanser onto a dry face rather than a wet one
it does't over dry my skin
even better is that this is the only "cleanser" i've ever used that doesn't make my face feel dry
couldn't believe that an oil would clean your skin
this product didn't leave my skin oily at all.
i didn't feel as if my skin was oily especially in the tzone
it also gets kind of messy around the sink area.
like many i have skin that tends to break out
not only does this gently
it is so gentle on the eyes that it doesn't matter if you get it in your eyes during the washing process
this does not make my skin feel oily.
helping to smooth those fine lines i'm getting because i'm dry
usually extremely dry in the winter
do get oil around my nose
it is too greasy to use during the day
cannot imagine wearing something this heavy during the day
i would not recommend for oily skin....
i could tell my skin looked less dull
allows you to get through the winter without a dry face
it is not greasy
which does happen from time to time with moisturizers with my type of skin
all of them didn't stay hydrate long time specially under make up i usually feel so dry few hours later
it is not too thick
for extra-dry days i also use a bit of the josie maran infinity oil
the skin on my face is crazy
too much moisture for my t-zone given my skin's extra oil production in hot weather
kept it to see how it would do as the weather got cold
this moisturizer works well on both areas of my face without breaking me out
the kind that breaks out through the dry patches if i don't h
even has a little spf
flake-free finish when it's really dry out
'd recommend more for someone with drier skin than normal
the only con i can report is it has a perfume type smell that i can catch hints of throughout the day
wanting for more moisture
t does take a bit more for me to see any signs of a sunburn
packaging is not the best since you have to dip your fingers in the tub
if i work up a sweat while working out
i didn't notice that this product is for dry/very dry skin
a few minutes after applying it the skin does feel nice
i recommend it for very dry days
t can soak in otherwise your foundation goes on super slick
applying little areas multiple times works better than trying to spread a large dollop of the moisturizer
it is not rich at all for my skin like i was worried about especially under my makeup
you are also getting your money's worth as you only need a dot on your forehead
especially if you have dry skin.
no dry patches of skin anymore.
it's too heavy to wear in the summer this product is for dry skin
in the summer, i do not have dry skin.
this cream provides the moisture you need where you need it without a heavy oily feel
i'd recommend it for normal to dry skin
it gives me the extra moisture i need
i didn't think it would suit my skin type because i'm usually a bit oily throughout the day
not heavy, not greasy.
she has rather dry-combo skin
definately not for oily skin
so use sparingly or concentrate on dry skin zones
feels like the right amount of moisture
it's the first one i've tried that actually moisturizes my eyes for longer than an hour
can rarely find an eye cream that doesn't sting or make them react
definitely doesn't leave residue or ball up
it also doesn't burn my eyes like most under eye creams do which is great
i love this eye cream because it comes on clean
does not leave any residue under the eye
to the extent that it will peal if i do not moisturize on the daily
my eyes are super sensitive to everything making it impossible to buy stuff that goes near my eyes
it doesn't burn or irritate
i won't live without this eye cream.
the texture alone is enough to buy this eye cream
would often get dried
worth a try in my opinion if dryness is a concern
i often lose a lot of sleep
it might be a little sticky
the air is very drying in the winter
i love the way the cream goes into my skin
it absolutely doesn't irritate the skin at all.
it gives me the moisture i need under my delicate skin around my eyes for the entire day
nothing really helped until i used a sample of this product of my eyelids
you can actually feel the moisture being absorbed into your skin
doesn't keep me matte all day
a must for your eye care routine
i struggle with dry skin
this is the best eye cream ever i've used just about every one it sucks being addicted to an 85$ eye cream
just the right amount of moisture, not too heavy.
it is not greasy so you don't have to worry about racoon eyes from your mascara coming off onto the eye gel
feel of it : it is not greasy
it doesn't leave a oily film
i am pretty sure it will last me longer than my usual $40 eye creams
even though it's for dry skin
i can tell it's working on my dry skin
this didn't make me breakout or extra oily.
my skin happened to get really dry due to a other temporary br
normally my face is more on the oily side than normal
i normally use hope in a jar
what little willpower or common sense i have evaporates
it is a little bit heavy for me during warmer days
many products were either not hydrating enough or too oily
small amount was enough to hydrate my face all day even in las vegas where it is very dry
no more tightness that comes with having really dry skin
be careful when you open it because the lid is big
it does not cause me to break out or irritate my sensitive skin
was a bit drying but not too much.
have almost had to avoid moisturizers in the past because they make my skin worse
since i have not found a moisturizer that improves my oily skin- only makes it worse
my skin just feels so pampered every single time i use it
my skin can get extremely dry because of it
other night creams i've used just seem to sit on top of the skin
light enough for even the oily areas of my face
i continue to get compliments on my skin
so soft after i use it
it's definitely a moisturizer that i know i can always go to if my skin is feeling dry or dehydrated
the texture is somewhat like a paste so not only does it seem to absorb
also kind of stays there so you have that extra hydrating protection
i find that when my skin isn't as dry
no other cream would even come close to soothing my face as this does
maybe now they can put it in a black glass jar
have been waiting for winter because my skin tends to get very dry
my skin got so dry from the odd cold weather we've been having
when i use before my makeup i tend to mix a touch of water in with it
if you are oily or sensitive you should try the serum
no pores sucking in whatever they can grab from my foundation
doesn't feel oily or heavy
this product has actually kept my face from drying out like an exposed piece of fruit
during the winter the temp has been -48 with a wind chill
so extreme temp to endure.
environment can throw at my exposed face
it would be dry
i usually can't use serums because they dry me out or break me out
it actually has helped with my dry patches
gets dryer every year it seems
sensitive skin break out once
this product also absorbs right into your skin so you don't feel like you have a heavy layer on your skin
swore i would go with the "other low cost stuff" or retinol
it helps a little with my pores but not a lot.
i can go out in the extreme cold without makeup
my face was drying really bad in the winter
i see a huge difference in my normally oily t-zone when using this product
didn't make my skin feel any more oily than normal
it does seem to make my moisturizer sink in better
oilier than you can imagine
at age 37 my blackheads were so huge i was embarrassed to even kiss anyone as that would mean they'd be up close
this product does not burn or sting
it was useless however this serum makes pores a tony bit smaller if you have very large pores you won't be satisfied however serums are meant to be used fir many months so our skin improves
it does seem to make the pores seem smaller
my face does end up getting oily as usual
lasts even longer if i wear blot powder.
it does minimize the look of your pores when you have it on
pores do become smaller as long as you follow a proper cleaning routine though
matte for a good hour or two longer than otherwise
buy almost everything under the sun
or if it is just supposed to give the appearance of smaller pores
that your skin still needs oil
mind you my pores are not huge
my only complaint is that it does make my skin quite oily
i actually have some marks on my nose from badly done blackhead extractions when i was younger
one pumps worth is all i need for the nose area.
i find that as soon as i wash it off
this is the only product that i feel not only masks my pores
my skin was not oily the entire day!
recommend this to anyone who suffers all day sheen like i did prior to use
it seems to work by keeping my skin from getting oily
tinted if that matters to you
i would not say that my pores "disappeared."
it's really good for making the pores on my face smaller
it would sort of cancel out any pore-enlargement from tanning haha :
even though my skin is kind of dry
an evening shot of moisture surge extra have made my skin as soft as it ever was
this product does not irritate my skin at all
i know beauty experts say that one's pores cannot be made smaller
please try this serum before you throw in the towel
didn't find it oily at all
it does seem to make my skin even more oily after some time passes
i also use the vitamin c liquid one during the day i don't know if i'm doing too much
i might be better off with some filler
use after wash your face you your skin will glow even more
like the way my skin feels after i apply.
i've gone so far as to talk to a plastic surgeon about getting filler
smooths really well so you don't have to use much at all
cold plasma face did all of the above
as i have very oily skin i appreciate the fact that this absorbs immediately
those with dry skin may find they prefer to use a moisturizer over it
she says her skin isn't even oily anymore
does not feel oily or sticky like some serums may
you can't just starve your face of moisture
it was still a little dry
under a day lotion in the colder months when my skin tends to dry out a bit
is not at all greasy or too thick
not really sure about sun damage
i do not really like the bulb top delivery system as it is a little thick for it
i feel it might be better to have it in a bottle that you could dip a clean finger-tip in
because i find if i use too much my face gets oily
it's going to be a just have in my daily facial routine
it is not going to remove your winkles
it will feed your skin with the proper stuff
this product's ingredients do not irritate my skin at all
as far as being greasy or oily
this product does not sting my face.
it does go on kind of thick
it is non irritating or drying
the product was so thick that the dropper could not pull it out
am always trying everything under the sun
it smells like your skin is burning when you put it on
so my face is very dry in the winter
one of the few products i have tried that does not irritate my sensitive skin
not greasy at all
i get compliments on my skin all the time.
i usually don't spend more than $50 on any facial cream
does not feel greasy at all
my skin just soaks it up compared to some that sort of sit on your skin
where it is very dry
parts of my face would be flaky dry
for years i've been trying to find some way to moisturize without breaking out
its just not perfumed which i prefer anyway
goes on light not greasy
i like it during warmer weather
love it during cooler weather
not leaving your skin greasy
my skin used to be so dry that it actually hurt
doesn't leave any kind of unpleasant residue
it gets dry and flaky and nothing seems to work.
even though the weather has gotten cold
have dry skin in winter
it plumps up or hydrates the skin cells so they look more like they did when i was in my teens actually
like i still had some baby fat in my face
it really does not cause breakouts even if i slather it on
gentle enough for every day use
it seems to absorb into my skin fairly quickly.
i am oily and dry depending on the day.
a lot of creams are too heavy for me to use in summer
doesn't make my face feel greasy or break out
i am still oily
it feels like a cool drink of water going on the face
it faded thebrown sun spots on my eyes just great if you made it in a 5 gallon bucket i would buy it
i did think that it made my face look greasy after application
i no longer felt greasy
i get compliments about my skin on the regular
doesn't make me oilier
does not leave a film on the skin or turn my face white
it doesn't leave your skin looking greasy
you know that finding a sunscreen that doesn't irritate your skin is like finding a needle in a haystack
this product does the job without irritating my skin
winter months my skin was too dry
i love it for when the weather gets cooler
not too smelly lotion absorbs so well into skin it feels like i'm not wearing anything
keeps my dry skin in check both in summer
it is never sticky, thick, or heavy.
the spf 20 is a added bonus that makes it easy for me to protect my skin daily
it's doing great with my dry skin
the only downside is that it tends to dry on the surface of my skin
peel off if i massage it on for too long
t doesn't seem like it absorbs into the skin very well
my only complaint is that it tends to dry
i actually have a pretty oily t-zone
most only go up to spf15
my face tends to be a little oily
probably great for dry skin.
however it burns some when i apply it
love how it totally seals all the moisture into my eye area
i usually like the thicker stuff.
i didn't notice anything miraculous beyond it being hydrating
with a cream this thick i'm not sure of a better way to package it
kind of like rotting food or fish
it stings considerably if you get it your eye
don't expect it to dry- think of it more like moisture all night for your eye skin
honestly i felt like i should have had a creamy lotion like eye cream because that's what i had been getting from all the other br
i didn't get near the moisture or benefits
$68 will last u a year if you stick to the grain of rice rule
come to find out from the sweet girl who sold it to me it is a makeup primer for the eye area
it was normal to lose a lash or two when scrubbing off mascara
it is creamy and also does well under make up.
as my make up eyeliner went on very smoothly as opposed to when i don't wear eye cream where my make up would feel as if i were scraping it across my dry lids
loved how it makes my concealer go on so much smoother without pulling my sensitive eye area
it's been amazing for the cold winter dryness under my eyes
its so hydrating that makes the fine lines around my eyes less noticeable as soon as i put it on
light which wouldn't leave me the feelling of oily
you see results very quickly with this eye balm
it's also not greasy or wet
etc this seemed like an easy after cleansing deal
i recommend this product to ppl who has normal to dry skin or live where the weather is dry
while i don't have under wrinkles or really dark circles i feel like this is such a good product
doesn't leave my under eye area greasy
because you only need a dab
it doesn't leave a lot of residue
what's great is that you can use this 360 degrees around the eye
i like it better then the shiseido eye concentrate because it feels a little heavier
it's also not greasy or wet
does not appear wet or greasy which is nice because it recommends you use twice a day so when you apply it in the morning it's not visible
it also doesn't break me out because i am acne prone
if it's pilling you used to much product
i wonder if the cream goes bad after a while because the smell now is a bit off putting
so far this has not irritated my skin or made it dry
i've only notice it if i use too much product or don't pat it on evenly
i didn't notice any white powder like others did.
just a little of whatever cream
so make sure the product is completely dry
if you use too much it cakes.
fills in wrinklesi used this off/on for years not really liking the white residue
used a brush like they said
it seemed to "dry" too quickly when i did that
just don't touch where you applied the instant firmx eye
you can set with powder though.
so you have to apply it by patting it under your eyes
works best fresh out of the shower when your skin has extra moisture in it
the only downside is sometimes i get the white residue
reapply sometimes because i put on too much
makes the bags just about disappear
to figure out the correct formula to not get the flakey dry white residue under your eyes
it looks like you've applied thin cement to your face
then lightly tap your foundation on top if necessary
make sure to let it dry
unless you have genetic puffy bags under your eyes like me
i found powder works better as it doesn't dilute the instan firmx --btw this product absorbs quickly so be quick on this stepd
use very little as it may dry cakey.
i pat it on until it start getting dry
until it is completely dry
i felt it's not very easy to rub onto the skin
as long as i let the instant firmx eye dry completely
it probably works best on lighter skin or under foundation because it does sometimes leave a residue which is light in color
it can leave a slight white residue if you use too much
when you put it on you can feel the tightening of your skin
frequently get really bad bags under my eyes from the lack of sleep
my only issue with the product is that you can't really put any creamy makeup on top of it or it'll start to crumble
it feels like a mask or treatment when you put it on because it has this instant tightening smoothing effect
then apply to your eyes.
let it dry and no white residue.
now i apply just a tiny bit to a totally clean skin
residue is a problem if you use too much
if you still have residue dampen a q-tip
note if you have white residue then you are using too much
although it does get flaky after using
the under eye area is the most problematic because it doesn't look good with many concealers or foundations
to rid myself of those pesky
the effects lessen a bit if you put a lot of moisturizer or foundation on top
in a few minutes you feel the coolness
she warned me there may be a white residue
make sure you shake the tube before you put on the lotion
if there's any white residue
rub it to make sure it is mixed
this product makes them disappear!
even though it fills them in too
doesn't make you oily
i don't know what makes it so much better than other silky silicone type fillers
if i want even more perfected pores i also put that ysl pink balm in the pink compact over it too
nothing works as well as this to make your pores appear smaller
i love that you can reapply it to touch up during the day
not greasy, not too matte.
it gives you a flat surface to work with once it's has been applied properly
it also did a very good job of hiding my pores — paired with the foundation i use
love this as an alternative on hot days when you want to mattify your skin without adding more power to an already sweaty situation
and you only need a tiny bit so it lasts forever.
other products that claim to do the same make me oilier
humidity in the summer causing makeup never last long before sweating off
tends to just make the pores look worse because the makeup just settles in there
the last amount gets really dry
it doesn't make my face feel oily or greasy at the end of the day
lightly tap it into the areas you want to treat
otherwise, it tends to get flaky.
this product does the job it claims to do- it does minimize the appearance of my pores
when worn under your make it seems to make your make up hold
its perfect for touch ups later in the day when your foundation sinks into your pores a little bit
it has helped keep my skin less oily
not oil-free throughout the day as i still need to blot
you can use it under foundation or powder
i really like this product it make your pores disappear
it does a good job of keeping your nose from getting shiny
not oily at all
it covers my pores for a few hours then i have to touch up with it
by the end of the work day my t-zone is so shiny it looks like i have the face sweats
when applied it turns into a powdery finish with pretty significant coverage
the only cleansing oil that doesn't burn my eyes
when i use this i don't have to wear as much powder or touch up
i never need to use foundation or powder my nose anymore
as in cannot even see my pores after i apply it
anything that can help hide the big pores is a product for my arsenal of make-up goodies
i've noticed as i get older my skin is just not as firm which seems to make my pores look a little larger
i feel like it tightens the skin where i apply it
that if i have not exfoliated well that it will leave a sort of flakey film around my nose
it also gives it a sheen that refuses to leave unless i neglect washing
so my skin is always shiny, and i have school.
bottom line: there will be sweat
it does make my skin smooth before i aplly make up
anything liquid on my face
doesn't cause my sensitive skin to break out
this does a nice job of covering my pores in that area
i just add some powder over my face
i get so many compliments on my skin
she gave me this as well as the cleaning oil
you put them on dry skin using dry hands.
then you wet your h
they just add foaming agents to give the illusion of better cleaning
it much better for your skin
keep my combo/oily skin under control in the humid summer
i've seen a lot of reviews where they say it leaves your skin really oily or the oil didn't come off well
you just have to use a lot of water after applying the oil to your face
it works well and does not dry out my skin.
t doesn't leave me oily
if you are expecting this to go one like baby oil you will be disappointed as it's probably a little less thick than liquid honey
while i'm applying it to my face i'm rubbing it in circles then let it sink in from my own body's heat
it's not easy to dry rub this on your face before adding water
very drying for me
how it lathers once i wet it
this is the first step in keeping my face moisturized on days when i know my skin will have to bear the winter skin
it's not needed on the skin
the directions clearly state to use on dry skin then add water to lather
i like to use this in winter when i need to protect my skin from drying
it also works out for oily skin as well because oil fights oil
what i don't like is the taste when it gets on my mouth
in the cold weather
oil where it usually is
my pores seem to be doing better
let it air dry
no break outs and it protects me in the cold.
although it is a little time consuming to apply it brings so much moisture to my skin
if you apply one or two pumps to dry skin
this is even great if you aren't wearing makeup because it gets off any extra dirt or oils
it's great for all skin types even oily!
you put it on dry skin then lather it
especially recommended for winter when skin tends to become dry
this keeps my face from getting dry
however i felt it necessary to "spread the word" that this product did something that the nose strips
could not do: this stuff is little by little unclogging the pores in my t-zone
love it in the winter as my skin tends to be dry.
both bottles i have of this were pretty thick kinda sticky to apply
when you mix it with water it gets kinda warm
i never thought i would wash my face with oil
the only bad thing is that it sometimes gets in my mouth
leave my oily areas under control
argan oil takes off makeup really well without drying out my super dry skin
t's great for people with oily skin too
i just let the cleanser sit longer on my skin/eyes to soften
i also shake the bottle before use because you can see separation of the oils
definetely doesn't dry the skin out
cleaning oil which sounds crazy in helping rid acne got rid of it all
it doesn't dry out my face or make it oily
it does not burn or cause any discomfort at all
this is the only cleanser that does not make my face break out
don't get it in your mouth
you only need 1-2 pumps, so it lasts for a while!
discovering they dry my skin out
i almost feel like i have to warm it up in my h
for everyone else this should be a lovely cleanser
i know you're technically supposed to use a face wash after cleansing with this product
it doesn't leave my skin oily at all
in fact i would argue that it actually help keep oiliness at bay
my skin doesn't break out at all when i use this product
tastes gross if you get it in your mouth
do one more pass then rinse with cold water
after i use it my skin is so soft unlike the products i used before that left my skin more dry
i recommend it to everyone that has really dry skin
thickness makes me feel like i'm wasting a lot of it
it's an oil so naturally it does not lather
my skin went from super dry to oily t-zone.
i am a user for life again was very dubious slathering oil all over my face
does not dry out my skin
i am someone who has always liked to have a squeaky clean face especially after removing make up however i am someone with very dry skin
if you've never oil cleansed it takes time
your skin may freak out at first
or it becomes too oily
it gives me sun protection without being greasy.
harder to spread than my favourite origins cleansing oil
couldn't be happier with this face wash
perfection i never tought i would wash my combination type skin with oil
it's great for dry skin days or after sun
like after a peel or something
make sure your hands are dry at first.
i just realized after reading the comments that you're supposed to use it on a dry face while i've been using it on my wet face
you feel as if all the gunk from inside has just been washed away
i don't like the idea of using any liquid or oil around my eyes
then i apply the cleansing oil elsewhere on my face
face need to be dry when you use it
rub all over your dry face
i break out really easily so finding a moisturizer that doesn't break me out is a big deal
being someone who has very oily
this product was great for my skin during winter when my skin got more dry
it has just the right amount of moisture to make my skin soft
i find it to be more oily
its ok products i have sensitive skin it doesn't give break out
i love this moisturizer because it doesn't break me out or make my skin greasy
does not get oily or overly dry
doesn't break out my sensitive skin
it is a bit sticky on the face which i dislike
the packaging needs to be redone cuz i've stopped using the cream because it seems like a waste of money to throw away so much of the product in the bottle
is not greasy at all
i look for moisturizers that are not heavy or oily because i tend to get oily in my t-zone
it gets really dry during the winter
face is not oily.
aside from how perfect this product is for dry skin
t's not greasy at all
your make up will just glide on smoothly after putting this moisturizer on
the amount of sunscreen in this is not overwhelming yet still gives you some sun protection
my face just drinks this stuff in.
i can go all day without having to blot or check my face for an oily shine
it is less oily as the day goes on
it doesn't feel sticky or oily at all
this works beat on my dry skin.
i definitely recommend this for those who have oily skin or combination skin
i wouldn't recommend it for someone with oily skin
i no longer have to settle for lotion that is passable
not greasy at all which i really love for my combination skin
note: i have dry skin
a little dry for winter
great to use under make up - not greasy.
my skin would be so dry i had to reapply daily
not greasy at all.
it works so well for my dry skin!
my t-zone would get really oily throughout the day while my cheeks get so dry that skin starts coming off
is not oily where it would make my t-zone worse
it might not be great for someone with oily skin because i don't know if it's too moisturizing
it is too heavy for me to use during the hotter months of the year because my skin is oily
while some are too oily or drying or don't have an spf
hauling a glass bottle around when you travel sort of sucks
does not leave my skin looking greasy
i like to use the benefit total moisture at night for my dry areas
this product doesn't make my skin look oily
the more oily parts of my skin have also not broken out due to this although i avoid applying near my more oily areas
my skin is clearing well so far.
i tried this as a sample so my comments are not from continuous use:pros-lightweighthydratingdoes not trigger breakoutscons-you can feel the spf when you first apply the lotionleaves face a little sticky
any other time it absorbs right away
smooth when you apply it
it is so light that i don't feel greasy using this during the summer
i wouldn't recommend this to someone with super dry skin
the only down side is you have to be careful with it around your eyes since the fragrance can make them watery
it is not greasy at all
i feel like it gives great moisture without going overboard
i gave it four stars because it did clog my pores just a bit
this will be great in the coming sticky hot months
on days my skin feels extra tight, i use two.
doesn't make me extra oily which is great since i have combo/oily skin
it does have a weird taste to it if you get it too close to your lips
it's not oily so even if you accidentally put too much on it won't make your skin look shiny
spf i need for my day without making my skin greasy
doesn't feel greasy on my skin at all
a bit more on the oily side in the summer
it did leave an oily
am not overly greasy throughout the day
it does not have a greasy feel to it
i think it is helping to add moisture back to my skin
it doesn't leave my skin oily
it takes only 2 pumps to get enough for my face
not oily or heavy
i don't produce as much oil did prior to this moisturizer
i would definitely recommend this product for oily skin
i only put this on the dry parts of my face
do not recommend for oily skin
oily skin would probably not benefit as much.
they keep my skin
gets rid of all dry spots
i live in the desert so my skin is usually extremely dry
i know this product is meant for normal to dry skin
this is the only moisturizer i've used that doesn't leave me feeling extra oily or thick on the face
i find it to be too thick for day time
my t-zone is a little dry
i didn't like it at first because it felt too heavy on my skin
this cream is best used before bed rather than immediately before applying lotion because admittedly
it is a bit oily
in my case, the oil helped my skin so much.
it doesn't have a very liquidy or oily feel at all
nothing seems to be thick enough or potent enough to get rid of my dry patches around my face i gave this a shot
i don't use this during the day because it doesn't contain spf
amazing it doesn'teave you oily
my skin can get very oily from time to time
i wouldn't consider it dry
dry skin that just gets flakier
total moisture is the only thing that'll fix it
only problem i had was that my skin was a little too oily for this
i do notice that my forehead gets a by greasy in the mornings when i'm cleansing my face
wouldn't recommend for oily skin
this moisturizer was my savior especially during the winter months when my skin would get very dry
i find sometimes i have to use two face creams for my face to not feel dry
sometimes on really hot days its a bit too much
great if you travel to dryer climates as well
i definitely recommend to anyone with normal or dry skin
i am usually oily
not greasy at all
then go to others because i break out or it makes my skin too oily or too dry
be careful not to add too much or it will feel greasy after a while
i normally suffer from oily skin however in the winter my skin becomes dry
most were too oily
i like really thick face creams that feel like they're working
doesn't go on greasy at all
it doesn't make my skin super oily
it can be greasy
i would not recommend for oily skin.
if your skin is dry or normal
nothing worked for my dry skin
the consistency is a bit thick however on your skin it is not
doesn't feel heavy or sticky
is not greasy for me at all
it has helped to get rid of my dry skin
would only recommend it if you have drier to combination skin
will be perfect for my skin as the weather gets colder
i started using this cream last winter because my face was getting sooo dry from the weather
i definitely recommend this product if you do have dry skin especially in the colder seasons
might change my mind come the next dry winter
which together are like magic for dry skin
doesn't dry my skin out even on the coldest
do recommend this because it delivers a lot of moisture
especially for those who have oily skin
makeup wasn't working at all because it was so dry
the areas just outside of it are so dry sometimes
they can get patchy
i do think there's a layer of some sort of oil that my skin doesn't absorb
t can feel a little slick
i applied this product just to my dry areas
it doesn't make my skin oily or breakout
rich enough to use as my night cream
it gives you just the right amount of moisture
no matter who dry my skin is
without leaving it too oily on the surface
it also has exactly the right amount of moisture
have a hard time finding moisturizers that prevent peeling yet don't make my skin super oily
are looking into trying this is truly the only moisturizer that doesn't dry your skin out--because there is no cetaryl alcohol or other types that dry skin out
recomend this to every one who has dry skin :-
my skin is super dry in the winter months
it gets dry especially during the winter
i started putting it on my lips during dry weather
it is a bit too thick if you want to wear it during the day on your face
sticky on your face there is still enough moisture that hangs out on top
i don't break out much, but have sensitive skin.
because it can look a little oily after application
i will note that i first tried it in the winter when my skin gets dry in some places
come summer it did leave my skin a little oilier than normal
sort of lifts the eyes of how hydrating this product can be
yet dissolves on the skin extremely quickly so there is no shiny/greasy look under your eyes
this cream has taken care of that both in super dry
i also use it underneath my make up.
how cooling it is on the skin-- however it does sting when i get it too close to my eye
a little goes a long way so no need to glob this on
my only complaint/warning is it really stings if you get too close to your tear duct
if you're searching for something that will nourish the area around your eyes while simultaneously brightening
if you solely want it for hydration or your eye circles aren't very dark
since i have both dry skin
it doesn't get rid of my dark circles as it claims
i'll keep using it until i find a product that actually works to get rid of the darkness under my eyes
this cream does help with that a bit.
i find just a small dab goes a long ways
it's thick but not greasy (i am dry to normal).
it hits the skin there with so much moisture that i didn't realize my skin was lacking every day
with my old cream i'd have to wash it out
i also find it doesn't make my eyelids feel heavy or my under eyes feel goopy
when i use it although it's very potent my skin absorbs it quickly
i actually like it better than the bobbi brown one
this does not irritate my skin or my eyes at all
it stings alot if you get it accidentally in your eye
wind and dry is our weather.
if anything it is soothing
didn't irritate the burn more
this is a very thick moisturizer which i love because it does the job for me
it doesn't get dry at all
get a sample of this before buying because its not like the ole henriksen thin quick absorbing one
when skin finally does start looking oily/foundation a bit patchy
reapply a bit of foundation because the skin underneath is as smooth as ever
nose for as long as i can remember
is too thick to use under foundation: makes it cake
it is perfect for dry skin in the winter
as well as to heal them so they don't leave scars
s when they need a little extra deep moisture
probably not enough if you have dry skin
which is where my skin is dry
this really helped get my dryness under control
therefore i always keep one of this cream in my shelf
you can put more on if you have dry skin
likely due to a combo of the dry weather
absorbs so quickly it's like it was never there
makes for an oily situation
this keeps my face from getting dry
makes the oily spots look almost normal
at the same time it doesn't make my skin oily
rather warm it up on your fingers
especially on my nose which tends to peel if i don't get enough moisture
breaks out if my skin gets too oily
this is much less greasy
the importance of this is that moisturizer does a much better job if it can get down into living skin cells
once it dries, you really can't smell it at all.
one pump can cover my entire face.
you can see the firmness
"thick skinned" gals like me might want to give it a try
is not sticky or oily
it does not dry out my skin
the best part is that my skin has been really clear since using it since the glycolic acid is constantly removing all the dead skin cells
my bottle looks like i have barely used any product
anyways they seem dry sometimes especially on my eyelid
after washing my face the skin feels almost tight until i apply
they go from bad to worse depending on my diet
which also happens to be very oily
it didn't sink into my skin as well as i'd liked
doesn't sting when i apply it
it doesn't give a ton of moisture
i actually had to stop using another eye cream because of its terrible scent
not as soothing/cooling as other eye creams i've triedin the end i had to give this 4 stars only really because of the steep price :
otherwise the cream is nice
because i have super sensitive eyes i can put this product right up to my lashline with no problem
just wanting to hang an eye cream for prevention
if anything gets in them they are a non stop watery annoying mess
it's thinner than a traditional eye cream which i like because i feel like it goes on better
my only reason for not giving 5 stars is the packaging: the tube often gets clogged
this is a great basic eye cream that does not irritate my eyes
a very precise squeeze tube instead of an awful tub where you have to stick your fingers in to get product
tried it because needed oil free creams for some time
it is a very good basic eye cream for those that do not have severe undereye issues
you shouldn't wear it out in the sun
this is the first eye cream i've tried that doesn't make them burn
it doesn't sting or burn
however it still did burn and sting a little.
i like the consistency of the product it is creamy without being too thick
not greasy at all
goes on very nice--seems to melt upon contact,
didn't realize that it was an eye cream
it seems heavy at first, but it absorbs quickly.
i actually put a lot on because the area around my eyes tend to be dry
this is my first "expensive" face wash.
so leaving it on for a bit does wonders to my skin
i feel like it takes all the gunk out
i like to use this dry
he likes a more rough type of exfoliator for his face as opposed to gentle scrubs or ones that have the little micro beads
i like to start off with it somewhat dry with only the tiniest bit of water
it was a little tricky to get used to in the beginning since you have to dampen your h
no need to scrub hard
without drying it out too much
it does not dry out my face
sinks right in 1 pump is all you need
i apply the aha concentrate first then 1 pump of the mask a thin layer is all you need to cover your face
s may feel oily
she said i should try to use this to remove dead skin cells that cause those post blemish marks
so be careful to scrub gently- you don't need much friction to get results with this scrub
i would recommend it to anyone with normal or oily skin type
it's like a massage on your skin every time you use it
dissolve into like a nice gentle foaming cleanser that does not leave your skin dry or tight
it also gets rid of my dry patches
the mask is thick-you don't need a full pump.
the third was more of a mousse than anything else
there is a really mild scent which doesn't aggravate my eyes
i really like this scrub.
doesn't leave any kind of film or residue on my skin
you only need a dime size to create a lather
not too harsh even in the winter
i really like this scrub.
the fact that my mia 2 scrub brush does the same thing
this would be way too much exfoliation for someone with dry or sensitive skin
it does not foam up
it's gentle enough that i can use a face brush
f you do have a blackhead it can be easily cleared with minimal squeezing
talk about getting under the surface
it didn't fully slough it off on my dead skin
you definitely can clean your face with a just small dab
this is so gentle it doesn't irritate it at all
this is nice since it foams up when you use it
only air comes out sometimes
it has gotten rid of my dull skin
there is a bunch all through out the mousse
t actually going to go exfoliate deep into the skin as well when i rinse off my skin is not red like most scrubs
you can use it sparingly.
a tiny bit will easily do your entire face.
my skin cells don't turn over as well as they should
you don't need too much if your face is wet enough to lather it up
very soft on the scrubbing action too!
you only have to use a little of it after you cleanse your skin to remove any excess dead skin cells that your initial cleansing may have left behind
use it only 2-3 times a week so the micro polishers won't end up irritating your skin
it is a good post cleansing polish if you use it sparingly throughout the weekplus
foundation go on more smoothly because the polisher is great at removing any of those really tough dead skin cells that an initial cleansing may have left behind
didn't feel like it was giving me good enough exfoliating results
it doesn't foam up too much
when you use it on your skin
not at all harsh or drying
you can feel small grains
you can feel them dissolve a bit
that doesn't last forever like with any scrub
i just hate how it kind of foams white.
absorbs really well if you take a few extra seconds to rub it in
she told me to try this product out for my sensitive skin because vitamin c supposedly gets rid of the darkspots
it does not dry out my face
sinks right in 1 pump is all you need
i apply the aha concentrate first then 1 pump of the mask a thin layer is all you need to cover your face
s may feel oily
i don't know what the key ingredient is that works so well at clearing congested pores
it gives my skin extra protection in the winter without being too greasy
my oil slick of a face is actually better since using it
not nearly as greasy as it usually is.
it is not greasy.
it's not too thick for my skin since i have super dry
it is not too thick or too thin
her new one is too greasy
i actually like this better than the fresh start eye cream by ole henriksen
it sort of just makes sense to protect your eyes with spf too
with the warmth of your fingers you can easily pat it in
i would imagine that the moisture helps to prevent the wrinkles as much as that is possible
it doesn't burn mine at all
doesn't burn or sting at all on me
" when you might forget to brush your teeth
it doesn't break out my sensitive skin
it does hydrate so effectively that they definitely appear less noticeable after application
my skin gets fairly dry in the winter
it's really worked well on my 44 year old skin in a dry climate
it is light enough to absorb easily
i got this because i needed an eye cream for day with spf
it absorbs quickly so that's not an issue
i didn't use sunscreen because it often stung my sensitive skin
just wanted to add that i have fairly oily skin
doesn't leave any residue or shine
i think this product works for me because the eye cream is not greasy
this did help in giving me back the moisture
not oily or too heavy
so just pat it on lightly
i did notice if you put it on your top brow bone
it's so thick that you just need a little for each eye
you can feel it adding moisture
does not cause my make-up to crease
t does smooth out
it just takes a tad longer than other eye cremes i've used
my eyes do water
not too heavy or greasy.
that goes away as your skin gets used to it
get dry patches around my eyes if i don't use a moisturizer twice a day
give it time because your skin will get used to the cream
i did not want an anti-aging eye cream.
i highly recommend this to people who have really dry skin around their eyes
this cream does not ork on the bags however it did provide moisture
you must truly not have dry skin
it does feel a little greasy when first applied
just decided to try it because i had some dry skin under my eyes
the cream is thick enough that you only need a tiny bit
it does seem a little drying
my skin responded very well to this because it didn't strip it of oils
this still dries me out especially on my cheek
the best face wash for sensitive skin i've come across
then you know how difficult it is to find a cleanser that does not strip your skin of all of your oils
my skin will sometimes burn or turn red after some cleansers
this product allows me to thoroughly clean my skin without drying it out
pretty much every fash wash out there for sensitive skin
this does not lather up therefore doesn't give your face that squeaky clean feel
which i never felt actually cleansed enough
you can also use it over your eye make up without it burning
they dry my skin out even more
i like to consider myself as having dry skin since the oil doesn't bother me too much
i need a cleanser that is free of a lot of things because my skin is very sensitive
i little goes along way so bottle lasts a lot longer than most cleansers
it has never dried me out or left me feeling dry
anyways just a pea size amount on my brush is enough
you need less than half of a pump to get a good lather so this bottle will last forever
i live in san francisco where our water supply is from snow melt so we have very soft water
you have to use half as much soap
it doesn't feel super tight or dry
does not leave it feeling oily like so many creams
a little goes a long way as long as you rub h
this is the only daily cleanser that i have yet to find that does not irritate my skin
it didnt dry up my skin either.
i am normally very oily
this is the only cleanser that doesn't make me break out
my skin feels so soft after i wash my face with this that i actually look forward to my nightly beauty routine now
i've tried everything under the sun for my sensitive
have trouble finding products that won't irritate
it's doesn't leave a weird residue or leave your skin dry
sometimes i use it twice to make sure all the make up is washed off
it is so mild that it doesn't irritate my skin
then if i have to breathe
it was really drying my skin out
would only recommend this to someone with very oily skin
it does not dry my skin out
a definite must try for those with sensitive/dry skin
does not dry my skin out
you get the anti aging too
it doesn't do much other than gently cleanse
i don't need to even use a full pump of this product to clean my face
what i like is that it doesn't leave a greasy residue afterwards
citrus can make you more sensitive to sun
other damage if used without sunscreen during the day
its funny because i have larger pores now that i am 30
it does absorb quickly and it not greasy.
she is normal to dry
this becomes a problem when i want to put on concealer or cover up to minimize the dark circles
even though it is rich it doesn't cause any bumps around my eyes either
never felt dryness in this brutal nyc winter days
hydrates enough that one application does the trick for the day
this one doesn't tingle and doesn't dry me out.
not too thin or greasy
doesn't irritate my skin at all
it took me years to find a cream that wouldn't irritate it
the only thing i would complain about is that my mascara smudges onto my face cause of the cream
i can easily wipe it away w some water
need to keep it out of your eyes
i break out in hives at most fragrances—let alone if put a fragrance cream on my face
i live in a very dry climate
it is not greasy or oily
note: i would recommend careful use of this cream around your eyes
the woman at the store told me this is one of the few eye creams you can put on your eyelids
i think it does help with dryness and is firming.
this is the only product i've used that doesn't irritate my eyes or skin
it doesn't make my eyes burn
my eyes can get very dry
a bit cool when applied
jar lasts a very long time
it does not make eye make up messy or look weird like some of the heavy eye creams do
though this is still very moisturizing don't get me wrong
low for a good eye cream that doesn't make my eyes puffier or cause my make up to smear off
i don't have dry patches or flaking anymore
i do not get those little bumps around my eyes that so many other creams give me
leaves a nice surface to apply make-up over
use two different topicals that tend to dry me out
it also does not "melt" into my eyes in the heat as annoyingly as some i have tried
on my way to sephora i had gotten a small sun burn driving there
mind you my face is as dry as the sahara desert
good for young skin too because it doesn't contain retinol or anything too harsh on the skin
i've tried so many other "sensitive" skin day creams that just don't cut it or irritate my skin
it honestly feels like face butter.
i find that this moisturizer is essential in the winter to protect against wind
it may not be rich enough to moisturize your skin if you have very dry skin
you can tell you aren't getting a lot of "filler" like the less expensive creams
when i want a little more hydration i mix a drop or two of algenist face oil in
i love that it doesn't have all sorts of anti-aging chemicals in it
one would expect that after you clean your face you should moisturize
sometimes as dry as a desert
i wouldn't recommend for oily skin
it gave me the right amount of moisture
but doesn't feel sticky or greasy on my skin.
i got this because the harsh nyc winter was drying my skin out
i break out in hives at most fragrances—let alone if put a fragrance cream on my face
i live in a very dry climate
it is not greasy or oily
i would never put anything on my face that could make it greasy or oily
the older i get the more i feel the need for more moisture
so for me the main concern is moisture
it is worth it to have skin that isn't dry or flaky
it is a little heavy for oily parts of my face
my skin is not prone to break outs
a little dab will do it
had seemed to not work as well for my dry skin
it makes my skin feel so much better in the cold winter weather
if you don't have dry or irritated or sensitive skin
have dry combination skin then this is a must try
not oily at all
perricone you have saved my skin from drying up
so a little extra blending is required to get a smooth finish
the skin is like silk after you put it on.
now when i apply light foundation to my face you can't see some of the sun spots i used to have on my cheeks
your spots won't fade overnight so be patient
my only criticism is that it is a bit drying when used twice a day so make sure
it doesn't dry out your skin
it gets oily a little
it stopped all of my little breakouts without drying my skin
be prepareded for soft skin when you're done.
after im done with the murad treatment i will be using murads spot remover because i want something to brighten my skin
people with warmer or dark skin tones will or should benefit from this
because it tended to make my makeup flake if i didnt let it dry amply
it also doesn't make my skin any oilier than it was to begin with
my skin has marks from every pimple i get whether i pop them or not
i really like how the serum is not drying at all.
whenever i use this i feel like i'm being treated to a min-spa session because it plumps my skin up like a baby's bottom
doesn't leave any residue afterwards.
it says clearly that the product won't come off only by rinsing
it does not dry in a day
so much better than any cleansing oil
this didn't dry it out at all while still melting away all of my makeup
let's get the main problem with this balm out of the way
lipstick with micellar water so consider that a factor that allows me to use only a little of this balm each time
dry out my skin or cause a break out
the first time i used it i slathered it on
it's a cleansing balm that apparently is made with some sort of mud
or even water to dry off
y in case you need to wash without running water
be sure to rinse that one well
there is no greasy feel upon removal as long as you follow the directions
it isn't drying at all
run it under hot water
you apply it over your dry face/eyes
my skin does not feel greasy after because i make sure to remove it properly
this did nothing to worsen it despite its somewhat oily nature
especially in the areas where you tend to get dryer
i then follow the balm with some type of face wash
still with some moisture in it so when i wash with my next cleanser my skin doesn't feel dry at all
it isnt so hydrating that it cant be used for normal or even combo skin
then once you start massaging it on your face
it does not make my skin greasy
i wondered why it left such a greasy film on my skin
wondered why the thermal cleansing balm hadn't had the same effect for me
once i used this balm the right way
i always double wash
reading the poor reviews because of the greasiness
soft afterwards with none of the dryness you can feel with other cleansers
it was the only cleanser out in the market that wouldn't break me out
i will like to add that just because my skin's dry doesn't mean i can put a scoop of cream on my face
i stay away from mineral oil as much as possible.
as soon as i put it on my face i immediately felt like i was in hawaii or some other tropical place because it reminded me of the ocean
fyi: you aren't supposed to "rinse" it off
that you need to use a warm cloth
i never use balms on eyes i just don't like the feeling
i like eve lom or even clinique thdo balm much more
you put it on dry skin
my clarisonic doesn't pick up anything after i remove this stuff with a washcloth
this stuff really has saved my skin from the horrible dry skin that comes from winter heating
there isn't any residue
it doesn't linger once you've washed it off
does not irritate my eyes whatsoever like so many other cleansing balms do
i am pushing forty and need the moisture.
the greasy feeling you have when you first apply it is kind of alarming
it really will wipe off with warm water
i can't put my finger on the other scent
making sure all of the balm has been thoroughly removed
be sure to read instructions on how to properly remove the balm
you have to thoroughly wipe a few times to remove any excess balm
if you were left with an oily/greasy residue
it's a fantastic cleanser for someone like me with dry skin that only gets worse over the winter
i didn't feel like i immediately had to put moisturizer on after using this
immediately upon applying it to my face the texture changed to be more spreadable across my face
doesn't linger with you
it doesn't irritate or dry out my skin.
i don't find it to be waxy or tough to remove.
it does feel a little greasy at first
if you can swing the heavy price tag this is a beautiful balm to keep in your arsenal
especially if you tend to get dry flaky skin like me
it does not come off simply by rinsing.
there's no greasy residue left on your face
once you pat your skin dry
with the colder weather
wondered why there was still an oily residue after having washed my face with warm water
because i have oily skin
wash it off with simply warm water
in the summer i get super oily with quite a few breakouts
also not overly drying as i have very dry skin
a lot people writing these reviews forget that this is a cleanser not a moisturizer of course your skin might feel after using this
doesn't leave my skin too tight
it kind of left my skin dry
no more over oily skin
error with cleansers over the last year that would not dry my skin out
i can't believe how clean my pores are
even after my most recent facial my pores weren't as clean as when i use this regularly
it does a good job of cleansing my face without drying it out or making it feel tight
this is just a great basic clean for my skin it doesn't leave too dry
it dries out my skin too much
adequate amount + without too much water/moisture on the face/h
doesn't dry the skin out.
does not dry it out
doesn't dry my skin
this did not irritate my skin
with the right moisturizer that can easily be solved
use what works for me without irritation
that does not leave my skin tight
this product is not drying at all!
it doesn't give me a dry tight feeling on my skin either which is great
you mix this with water
can be used with a clarisonic brush
also can be a tad drying
scrub with a wet wash-rag or as the brits call it a flannel
didn't feel this dried me out more
nothing to make actual experience of washing one's face anything to look forward to
it did not irritate or dry out my normal skin
they don't seem to hold up as well as the algenist cleanser
it's also not drying at all.
not five is that after continous use it can be drying to the skin
since i have dry skin already i like to retain some moisture in my face
i wouldn't recommend to use this twice a day everyday if you already combat dry skin
doesnt break me out or dry out my skin
i found it to be a little drying on my combination skin
you only need a pea size amount to get a really good lather for the whole face
adding a little bit of water as you go
it doesn't dry your skin out
it turns red easily whether it be from cleanser
so far it does not seem to be causing dryness
it does not leave it dry it hydrates it after wash
i am 58 & found this to be a bit drying.
my general experience with them is that they dry out my skin or my face doesn't feel clean after using them
it doesn't leave my skin dry afterwards.
i've had trouble finding a cleanser that did not dry me out or go the other direction
make my face feel tacky or like i still needed to wash
you only need a little amount to cleanse
i wanted to get another wash with 10% hyluronic acid
the only thing i would like is if it left my skin a little more emollient
which i normally don't like being i have oily skin in the t-zone area
a small dab is all you need
i dislike unnecessary chemicals that are not good for you
all my eye make-up comes off so there's so rubbing my eyes with a cotton ball after cleansing
not too dry after i use it
it doesn't dry out the skin
has a lot of slip until you add water
then does lather up well
this has a soapy smell to it which took me a couple days to get over
oil off of your face
have never been happier with the way my make-up stays all day on my oily skin
doesn't dry my skin.
i noticed when using my toner that i would see makeup on the little pad
i don't notice makeup on my pads anymore when using my toner
the facial wash being so great convinced me to spend the extra money on the
if i get really dry
really only in the wintertime
i can mix in a drop or two of whatever facial oil i'm into
this stuff was not heavy or greasy
another bonus is that it doesn't make my sensitive skin break out or flare up
how the pump doesn't pump out too much product
is oily in the summer
dry in the winter
if my skin is a bit too dry
is never greasy or heavy
don't do well with creams or anything on the heavy side
jar package so you won't be throwing your money away
i like this one since many others leave me dry patches on my cheeks this is not too oily
revive night cream so my skin doesn't get used to either one
this stuff is like liquid gold for my dry
it has not only solved my dry skin
is not greasy or heavy
it is not sticky or greasy.
make sure you get the oil-free formula
the regular one is too heavy on my skin
as cooler drying weather was rolling in
this is my absolute staple as i can use it in combination of any chemical or physical exfoliate without worry of irritated skin
doesn't feel heavy or greasy
takes care of my extremely dry skin without causing my t-zone to become oily
not oily or overly dry
i still get dry patches
which i blame on what is called "second puberty" which usually happens in your early 30's
would actually help my dry winter skin
or if your skin is in need of serious quenching
this jar lasts quite awhile since you just need a thin layer
want to start using anti aging products after spending so many years in the florida sun
i my skin does seem very oily after i put this on at night
absorbs fast so you use very little
this does not irritate my skin at all
if you want more of brightening effect try the anti aging cream it works wonders
unlike wake up with a oily sticky face from any other night cream i've used before
keep going until the skin seems saturated
not too heavy not too light.
i never thought i could use an "oily" product on my skin
this does not feel greasy
have a hard time finding a moisturizer that does what it should without leaving me greasy
it dries quickly but my skin doesn't feel greasy.
it can make your face overly saturated
not at all greasy
non-oily in my life
when i do get the occasional pimple it dries up
i don't want to have to wash my face in the morning due to my oily skin
let it kinda melt in your fingers
you can't find any other cream with these ingredients
before use my skin was really dry
the price is the only thing keeping me from drenching my h
feels so much better after applying this cream
what i enjoy about this product is that it deeply moisturizes without feeling heavy or causing breakouts
i no longer have dry flaky skin
i am dealing with dry skin on top of it
i do still wake up with somewhat dry skin
maybe i just really need to slather it on during the winter drying months
used it when my skin was dry
despite the cold weather my skin has not dried out much since using it
flakey with the winter cold
when i applied on my skin
not too thick like some can be
disclaimer: haven't used in in hot weather yet
texture: a rich almost "whipped" qualityscent: like an unscented body lotionmoisture level: on a scale of 1-10 it's probably a 7or 8 depending on how much you use
even though i have oily skin
not oily at all
in the winter months i do get some dry patches
since using this product my skin is less oily in the morning
it wasn't dry or tight or greasy at all.
my skin did not absorb them
without making it oily
have started putting it only on my non oily areas
this one has not made me break out or made my skin oily at all
this cream keeps things in check
it doesn't make my skin feel oily
doesn't have any oily shine when applying.
i definitely like how the cream does not leave a greasy residue on your facewill definitely buy again
is not oily in any way
my skin just drinks this stuff up
even though my skin is still a little oily in my t zone
even my combo skin gets dry
doesn't make my skin oily or shiney through my make up
the dry air is almost worse than the desert
would recommend if you have drier skin
as i get older having fresh looking skin isn't as easy
it's not as terrible as other tops like this since you can wipe everything off easily
oils tend to make me break out
it is a little of a chuck for a face mask
it does need to be used regularly depending on one's skin
in genral my skin feels dry in the winters
my skin turns out be a bit dried out
make sure you exfoliate before you apply to get the maximum benefits
my skin got dried with the winter
okay so apparently this winter my skin decided to become dry
oily in the summer and dry in the winter.
it doesn't feel as dry as it used to most winter days
does not feel greasy
this is the first moisture mask that doesn't make me oily
t won't get on your pillow
because i didn't like to wait for mask to dry
don't have to wash it off
doesn't have that sticky feeling.
now i have oily
so this product many not be in many uses to me as i do use a drying cream to clear my acne
it wasn't doing the trick to replenish my skin of my natural skin type
i am thinking of spending the money on this product to use when i'm breaking out from dryness
the sample i happened to have of this totally saved my sun-overexposed skin from actually turning into a sunburn
in the morning there is generally nothing to wipe off
you will need that extra moisture to make your face looking fresh
however overnight while sleeping you lose moisture even in your face
i hope i can feel more in the fall when my skin would become dryer
don't slop it on--put on the same amount of product you would use if you were applying a regular moisturizer
i don't wake up with dry skin
it's so easy because you use this overnight instead of your moisturizer
my skin isn't dry any more
you'll wake up with a soft
that won't cause a break out or wear like a thick cream
always need extra moisture
so maybe if your skin isnt thirsty
where its super dry
it is however a little sticky
doesn't feel thick or sticky while you're sleeping
then you just wash it away with water
it doesn't break me out or make my face oily
in the winter time i sometimes use it for daytime for a little extra moisture
i like that it is not too heavy on the skin as night time moisturizers tend to be
most moisturizers seam to wear off after so many hours like i never even put any on
normally after adding powder my face feels tight n dry
not greasy or oily at all.
this never feels too heavy when i apply it after washing
finding a product for all of this that didn't make me more oily or cause breakouts was hard
wake up non-greasy
not add oil to my t-zone where i tend to break out
keeps my combination/dry skin in the winter looking better
so light i didn't think it would help my dry winter skin
i should have listened to the sephora specialist when she told me this was too heavy in moisture for my combination skin
i've never used a cream more than a few times because they tend to clog my pores
just make my oily
t's pretty hard to find a product that moisturizers enough with out making me break out or have blemishes
when i need that boost of moisture
the always changing temps do a number on my skin
it helps keep my dryness down because of harsh oh winter
it's not keeping up with my sudden dryness
i like to use this night or day when skin is feeling tight or dry
it does not set on your face in a sticky sense
then i get peeling skin that can be raw
definitely perfect for night time because the cream is on the wetter side
this is the only moisturizer i've tried so far that completely eliminates any dry patches for a solid 12-16 hours
i think its just sensitive because i was stripping it
creamy enough to give you great night time coverage
it is not greasy or oily!
needed something to make it less dull
my skin immediately goes back to being dull
i've never been an at night moisturizing person because even the next day i could tell my skin was more oily
t's nice to find a night cream that doesn't involve me waking up to really greasy skin
would absolutely recommend this for people with very dry skin
it works better when i use after a peel
perhaps the weather is not cold or dry enough
a lot of moisturizers either leave my cheek/chin area dry or make my t-zone extra oily
i don't wake up to an oily face
my entire face seems to have the level of moisture in the morning
it doesn't make your skin greasy
my skin no longer dries out or break out
not at all greasy
when my skin starts to get a little dry or after a break out when the acne treatments leave dry spots
my skin looks amazing i can't believe i found something that took the heat
not too greasy and works well with my retin-a.
this cream didnt make my skin break out or oily at all
its just not enought moisture for me at night during the winter
absolutely no rough or dry patches whatsoever
you may feel slight sliminess in the morning.
they dry my skin out pretty badly
it does get a little dry around my mouth
i like this cream because it doesnt break me out or make my face oily
it doesn't leave my face oily.
it would not cut it for people with dry skin or dry winter conditions
it gets incredibly dry in the winter months
what i love about it is that i don't wake up with a face full of shine or oiliness
t doesn't leave a greasy shine to when applied
you can leave your house bare because it's so light
not at all greasy or oily
completely hydrates my skin without feeling greasy or anything like that
an oil slick on my t-zone
i noticed that i'm still oily after a few hours so this isn't extremely hydrating
other times it can be really oily
the thing that concerns me the most is finding a moisturizer that won't break out my wishy washy skin
if its really hard for you to find a good face moisturizer
more importantly doesn't cause any break-outs to my sensitive skin
this moisturizer has never broken me out or irritated my skin
doesn't turn into an oil slick by lunch time
dont like the residue it left
i still need to rinse my face after the use because i feel some residues on it
i've noticed that my skin would easily get oily throughout the day whenever i used this
i really like the pump bottle
i think it's because i'm using too much on my cotton pads for my eye area
this does not irritate my skin or eyes
wait for it to dry out
like using my own cotton too.
best of all it doesn't irritate my eyes or skin.
t takes me much time to get used to that pump without spattering around
*yuck* its hard not to splash some on your mouth.
you can almost always use this to clean your face as the cotton ball is clean when you're done with a few swipes
i can't have anything too oily cause it feels like i'll never get it completely wiped off
this water is literally like water.
i hate the taste it leaves in mouth when i take off my lipstick
i can also get closer to my lash-line using the cotton pad than i ever do with oil
i don't want to rub oil into my eyes
it doesn't leave a sticky residue or otherwise feel gross on my skin
which i'm pretty sure are just water
i love this cleansing water because it removes make up easily without the messiness of an oil
it isn't drying, either.
then add a little of this water to remove product from my eyes
doesn't make my eyes dry and has no oily residue.
i still rinse my face out of habit though.
i don't feel a residue.
it does leave a somewhat sticky finish
my face gets dry in fall and winter.
it doesn't have a greasy feel or leave any residue
he felt that slight tingle that makes your face feel like you have little scrubbers in each pore
only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is the bottle which is horrible to get the liquid out of
my face doesn't dry out
it easily takes off just about everything with the exception of some lip stains
it doesn't dry out my skin or make me breakout.
it can sting your eyes, so be careful.
doesn't leave skin dry or stripped
does stay on skin for a while
i really like this micellar water as it is light
i can use it for touch ups under my eyes without rinsing
buy i found that it was drying out my already dry skin
sometimes i use this with my double cleansing as well
it does leave a little bit of a residue
to me this residue is a bit of an oil
for me this is ok, because my skin is dry.
running it over your face afterwards if you have issues with the residue
with pore that clog easily i need more than just this to have a full clean face
i usually break out when using face washes or make up removers
if you're simply using this to cleanse before makeup i have never noticed a greasy feel
the smell of this product does not match the rest of the origins ginzing line
i really like the light texture that dries pretty quickly
as it usually did before i start using the ginzing eye cream
doesn't leave the skin greasy
the facial scrub because it makes my skin feel so much more hydrated than anything i have ever used in the past other origins products included in that
this little cream in a jar does that!
mainly for people just starting out into more skin care items or those that just want a simple eye cream to hydrate
that it only takes a small dab to work so this will last a while
it adds the moisture i need without overdoing it
i like how it just disappears on my skin
what i like about this eye cream is that it won't leave my skin oily nor sticky
it is not heavy
those who don't typically wear an under eye moisturizer because of the greasy properties
i wouldn't recommend if you have super dry under eyes
thinking of trying out the facial cream too.
its really great in the summer because heavy products just melt right off in this heat
i recommend for you to wait around 10-15mins if you plan to use this in the morning before applying your makeup cause that way your skin can absorb the eye cream first
drinking lots of water + this eye cream will probably yield better results if its puffiness that you really want to address
does not sit heavy on the skin
it is not heavy
even though this is a cream it is so lightweight.
origins ginzing refreshing eye cream is not just a some "run the mill junk
super recommend this to anyone who stays up late cleaning
it feels light and not greasy as well.
doesn't burn if i rub my eyes which was a problem with my last eye cream
it doesn't burn or irritate my eyes at all either
being worn throughout the day it didn't make my skin oily
is very light doesn't leave a residue
the one side is that it doesn't do much for when my eyes are super puffy unfortunately
not dry it out
this face wash is one of my all-time favorites
when i use this face wash i notice that my skin is less oily
it doesn't dry out my skin at all
i literally can't go a single day without this cleanser
really good face wash, does everything it clams.
completely stripped it of any oil so much so that my moisturizer couldn't help it
only complaint is that when i wash it off it feels sticky
after i use i don't feel dryness at all
however it loses a start because its more like a cream
not having any anti-ageing effects this face wash is perfect for you
doesn't totally dry you out
sometimes my face decides to dry up in certain spots just because
doesn't dry me out, doesn't make me more oily.
is that it can dry out my skin a bit
my skin has never dried out
with combo skin i find it hard to pick a cleanser that doesn't dry out my face
not dry at all
nothing comes close to the results of this wash
my face no longer gets excessively oily
it does not over-dry my combination skin
giving it a great "clean" feeling without stripping all of the moisture out of my skin
usually put on the ole henriksen truth serum afterwards just so my skin doesnt feel tight
for dryer skin types it may feel too clean
i got this because this was good for oily/combination skin
although it does leave a little bit of tightness on my dry cheeks if i don't use a moisturizer
i find it gentle enough to use all over my face morning
i wouldn't say it controls my oily skin
love the way my skin feels when i rinse it off
it really helps clear their skin up
dry or sometimes one or the other
i usually get small breakouts here
this didn't irritate my skin or dry it out
doesn't irritate or dry out my sensitive skin
my skin doesn't feel like i'm stretching it every time i move my face
it does a great job on deeply cleaning the skin without making it tight or dry
as you wash it off your skin feels so fresh
you will love this face wash
when i see or feel a breakout this instantly dries it out
i like that you can see it lather up on your skin
it's not over drying
i notice i don't get as oily as i normally do with other cleansers
recommend this for anyone from oily/combination skin
is a lot less oily
the only downside is that if i use it in the shower to get my makeup off it feels like it leaves a film over my face
lathers up a ton so a little can go a long way
does not dry out my skin
maybe its because i follow with the toner?
only a small amount is needed to get a nice lather
it makes my skin feel clean after without the dryness that is typical of other products i have tried
i loveeeeee this face wash it's kept my face clear even when i'm about to get my usual period breakouts
it is very drying which i like because i have very oily skin
also you don't need a lot of product it lathers
not oily after using it
doesn't overdry my skin but cleans it very well
i like to use it in the shower
can get it rinsed off really well
i usually have wild dry skin
doesn't seem to dry it out like a lot of cleansers do
it does dry your face out
it didn't break my skin out or dry me out at all.
so finding a face wash to keep that in check without over drying is complicated
i would recommend this combination to anyone with super oily skin
not a bit dry after using it
i find my skin is almost always right after cleaning
doesn't dry me out
this doesn't dry out my dry spots
if you smear it on
not oily and i didn't look greasy.
t does burn a little
do not rub all over your face!
it also dries your skin out in the area you applied the product
it gets rid of my acne really fast i just wish it didn't burn or dry my skin out
make sure you use it on clean skin
it's really only effective when it the zit is still forming or it's just an oil pocket under the skin
even when i'm feeling my skin begin to purge
it has not dried out my skin
it does dry your skin so highly recommend to only put a very small amount on the spots itself
it will start to dry
this way it doesn't cause dry spots on my face.
it basically dries them out.
f you have extremely dry skin
it doesn't leave my face too dry after use
i just get the occasional pimple because of my period or because of a certain product i put on my face
it says to wash the area thoroughly anyway
then there is no dryness or peeling
this is perfect to use in a situation where you have either a single pimple or a few clumped together
if it burns your skin it's working
it will make it a bit dry on the area you put this product at
it seriously makes bad acne disappear so so so quickly
irritation is calmed really well so that it's easier to cover
i really have to blend it into my skin otherwise you can actually see the spots with the product after applying makeup causing my makeup to look patchy
i finally found something that really helps heal my skin fast without irritating
it does tend to give off a burning/itchy sensation where ever you put it
i also really like that it doesn't dry my skin out after using it
every time a new pimple arises big or small or does the job in less than 48 hrs
it does make my pimples heal up much faster than they would otherwise
it dries even really angry
now for my oily skin i wash twice a day
i usually moisturize before putting it on to protect my skin too
this is my go to spot remover when any pimple is coming out
you can see the pimple becomes so small
however i can say that this one is much effective because its clears the pimple bumps without getting darken for a long period of time
doesn't work very well on just regular blemishes
it does dry the spots out
you can even c the pads smaller
i find it really does help in clearing up my skin
it does however leave dry patches spots so be sure to really clean off in the morning
also dries out the acne so that in a day or two
i've never come across anything that got rid of deep pimples as well as this does
it does burn a little but nothing uncomfortable.
none of them could clear up a pimple as fast as this stuff
it will dry your skin so use at your own risk.
nothing beats some good time out in the sun with no products on your face
word of warning: do not apply to areas with broken skin
it tingles for a moment when you first apply it
let me just say this product has helped with the huge pimples i get underneath my skin
it burns just a little just it goes away.
it does dry out your face
when i break out its usually due to what i eat or hormones
it definitely drys them out
i let this dry
it didn't dry out my skin.
this stuff literally got rid of my acne in 1 day!
it is normal if you feel a little tingle/burn meaning the product is working
because this product will irritate your skin a lot
this does not have a watery consistency at all.
i would characterize my skin as normal-to-dry
i do apply it a little more sparingly in my acne danger-zones
decollete the most as well as when i plan on putting bit more make up on my face
yet my skin gets dry if the mosturizer is too light
i take care of my skin
i tried almost everything sephora sells for very dry skin with fine lines
it doesn't make me sweat walking outside on hot days
this is a light day or night moisture cream that does what it says
this is thick but not heavy.
i will certainly finish the jar
get oily in the tzone
its not oily or greasy
it doesn't make me break out even though i'm acne-prone
not greasy or heavy.
if you are very dry skin
although it's thick it won't leave your skin feeling greasy or heavy
okay, so now i am 59 and have really dry skin.
my skin has become dryer as i've gotten older
it's back to the sephora age defy night moisture cream for me
it also did not seem like my skin absorbed the product completely
(but i have really dry skin).
because it does have leave a greasy or shiny residue on my combination skin
it didn't do more than beyond hydrating my skin
it is not too heavy or greasy
it can be used under makeup without feeling heavy or greasy
normally it's the other way around where i go to bed with soft skin
my skin can get really dry/flaky in the winter
good cream but too heavy for me.
my skin feels like it can breath
it is not heavy
i normally have very dry skin
moisture that didn't dry up after a few minutes or hours or wash off with the product
for us dry skin ladies it makes you look
at first you might think its a bit greasy
doesn't make me oily
this product does not irritate my skin at all
it wasn't oily but was very fluid all the same.
i would recommend this serum to anyone who has dry skin
it can be too much for even my dry skin to put makeup on top
you want this between the air and your skin.
if i didn't have sensitive skin
it may feel slightly greasy on application
in a dry climate with winter
it only takes one "pump" to cover your face
it's supposed to protect your skin from the outside world
i like to wear it under my mineral foundations since i might need some extra moisture
i wanted to try some kind of serum for my skin
gives it a light 'protective layer' that you can't feel once it sinks in
once that happens you need to keep rubbing it into your skin
it doesn't take long to sink into your skin
wish it was in a pump or squeeze tube bc i think a jar exposes it to too much air so the ingredients "expire" faster
get it if you have dry skin.
it does wonders for my dry skin
my dry skin is so spoiled after this
this is one of the few night creams i've used that doesn't make my eyes water
it made my face look super oily
this is for bed time so the oily consistency shouldn't be a problem considering it does wonders for your skin
it doesn't skin in 100%
sometimes when i wash my face in the morning i can still feel the lotion sitting on top of my skin
as someone with normal skin
that occasionally gets a bit dry in the winter
definitely just for nighttime use because it can make your face look a bit shiny
not greasy in anyway
when i first started to use this product i wasn't sure if it was doing much for my oily combination skin
i either use this alone at night or mix in a little of my clinique dramatically different lotion
my skin literally drinks this up with every application
supposedly this is only for dry/combination skin
generally just makes you look refreshed when you wake up
whereas most other night creams i find to feel heavy or thick
i normally use origins' overnight moisture mask during winter for dry patches that just won't quit
non-greasy finish for a night cream
our alberta winters are pretty dry
now i've got dry patches too
my only complaint is that i also wake up looking like an oil slick
this doesn't feel heavy or oily at all
my dry skin sucks it up
flakes as soon as the weather turned cool
where winter is a little more wet
if your skin is dry
you're in a dry climate
which means my skin is dry
maybe try to non oil free for winter time
get a little more moisture
first impressions is that it will help me with my dry spots
it's a must have in my skin routine!
have trouble findin a good night cream that does the job without causing breakouts
the only problem i have with this is that sometimes it's not hydrating enough for the drier areas on my cheeks
nothing i've tried has gotten rid of that tight feeling under the skin like this
even though it's meant for the evening i use it in the day time because it doesn't make my face look oily
amazing for both oily and dry areas.
it goes on non-greasy
i immediately felt that my skin was getting the moisture it needed
which most of the time if the product is heavy it will leave me feeling oily
breaking out or just need moisture back in my skin
i think my skin produces less oil during the day now because it is getting the hydration it needs at night
use that just before the lotion occasionally when i'm feeling more dry
not greasy at all
doesnt really matter because its a night cream though
this lotion goes on thick when you first put it on
you begin to second guess if your going to wake up with an oily face
i can't believe how fast my pigmentation from damage is going away
if your skin is a least a bit dry
although it will seem greasy putting it on
i don't feel oily after using it
yet my oily t-zone doesn't feel greasy
was a little worried that it might be too heavy for me since i live in hot/humid weather
this cream doesn't feel heavy at all
doesn't make my oily parts more oily
it really draws any under-the-surface blemishes out so while it may make your skin a bit worse the next day
indulge in a night cream like this since you're producing less oil while you sleep anyway
my face doesn't get irritated as easily as it usually does
it doesn't make me feel greasy or like there is a film on my dace
it gives me the amount of moisture i need
this may be a bit heavy for oily skin types
it doesn't take much product at all because it moisturizes so well
i am on the drier side
used to be more dry
my face tend to become more oily
i noticed that my skin would be dry after using their face wash
b cleanser dry out my skin on top of my new dry skin since it became the winter
this has been a gentle cleaner that doesn't dry out my face
t foams up very good therefore a little goes a long way
more like the zero oil face wash
it drys out my skin a bit
it wont dry out , but gives a nice cleanse.
i normally try different cleanser every time i run out
you only need a tiny bit for your entire face
completely without drying my face out
doesn't burn or dry out my skin.
as a girl with sensitive skin i'm always on the lookout for good cleansers that won't decimate my face
it did not dry my skin out at all!
nor did it irritate it like other face washes have in the past
not dry after use
i don't mind the drying aspect of this cleanser though because i follow up with a serum almost immediately after
it doesnt dry my skin out
i like the fact that it does not leave my face with a filmy residue
i like to rub it all over my face
it also doesn't dry my face out
the only down side is that with my clairsonic the cleanser tends to drip down to my eyes making it sting like crazy
it also doesn't dry you out
i would definitely follow up with a moisturizer after for it tends to dry out your face a little
just wet your face
even though you shouldn't by skin care based on scent this is really lovely
doesn't dry out your face
super clean after i use it
using one when my face seemed oily
because this face wash never dries my skin out
never leaves it oily
the only negatives to this product is it doesn't lather as nice as checks
f you get some in your eyes it will burn
i wished it lathered a little more.
but, never the less it cleans good.
you just need a small quantity to clean your face
i love that this doesn't sting my eyes too badly if i accidentally get any in my eyes
it gets really oily
this face wash is great on dry skin!
it doesn't dry out my skin like those other face washes
i think i'll use this face wash forever.
i really enjoy that this cleanser grabs all the dirt
t doesnt dry out my skin
it's strong enough to wash off my makeup without sacrificing the moisture in my skin
without an abundance of moisturizer alongside them i flake like crazy
does not dry out my face
the only reason that i can't give this five stars is because i feel like it pulls most of the moisture from my skin
it does burn my eyes more than any face wash i've used
this has been helping control my summer oily skin
it stings a little if you get it in your eyes
my skin is normal with an oily t-zone
it has a really great lather so you only need a pea size amount which is nice because it's more than i would typically spend on a cleanser
it completely dried me out
summer when my skin tends to produce more oil since it can be a tad drying
i will say that it foams up nicely
i prefer this over the very dried solid texture of the check
doesnt dry it out at all!
great face wash if you have normal or dry skin.
i like to use it after washing my face
it doesn't irritate my skin either it reminds me of the glamglow mud mask
this charcoal mask from origins is what i always come back to
too often will leave my skin too sensitive
i now use a warm wet cloth to get it off!
i love using this mask to spot treat my breakouts or to do my t-zone when it's feeling oily
t doesn't dry my skin out
it also gets rid of blemishes really quick.
i wouldn't recommend this for dry skin, though.
you often have to be careful if you plan to go out in the sun or have sensitive skin
what i love about this masque is that you can actually feel the charcoal absorbing the oil on your face
let it dry for about 20 minutes or so
i find that this mask is wayyyy too drying when used all over my face
i could really feel it opening my pores
it's tough for me to not use this everyday--make sure you wipe it off/rub it off with a wet washcloth to get all of the bits off your face for best results
occasionally it leaves my skin super dry
i will definitely buy this again because it the charcoal really does help acne prone skin such as my own
remember to open your pores with a hot cloth or applying the mask as soon as you step out of the shower for the best results
it can be too drying for my cheeks
this definitely helps to make it less oily
i definitely feel like my skin has gotten a deep cleanse after i use it
i skip some parts of my face where clogged pores are not a problem
it really cleared things up but wasn't drying.
my skin is not dried out
you'll still see skin underneath
hot for hours after i wash it off- there's actually a nice cooling sensation while it dries
i will try a different charcoal mask next time
this product does not irritate my skin
i prefer this mask over the glamglow ones as i found the gg masks extremely drying with price more than twice
do not dry the skin.
however you can do this if you are trying to dry out a large pimple
it gives a cooling sensation when you first apply it
i always use it after a shower
i do find that it helps make my skin feel less bumpy
it can be a bit drying
this mask is not over dry or irritate my skin
all you need is a thin layer of this stuff
i swear i could feel this mask pulling the dirt
oil right out of my skin
i put it on thick enough that you can't see my skin tone underneath
i also tend to use it when i'm taking a bath so the steam also helps this along
i used it once a week to deep clean my skin
my skin is on the oily side so this is great at removing excess oil
i find that it's easier to remove with a warm washcloth
i tend to stay away from masks because they can dry out my skin a lot
usually it's nearly impossible to get my blackheads out
once i washed it off i did see some of my pores definitely got smaller
even though i prefer peel off masks
you can feel the mask working while it dries.
just make sure you apply moisturizer like your life depends on it
was wanting a good charcoal make
it also wasn't too drying
t can make very very oily people break out bad
it's good for clearing skin for normal type people
it took me longer to rinse off than any other product
when i have a breakout i slather my face with this stuff
is also makes for a great spot treatment when you need to get rid of a pesky zit before a night out
i feel less oily as well after using it
it doesn't really dry me out
my face normally if i go out gets oily
if i wash or use a mask gets dry
i would normally feel like i applied cement
not drying at all
it's not going to remove every single blackhead you have
my face tends to be dry and it didn't dry me out.
this gets rid of it so fast
this cream doesn't feel too heavy
this cream helped my dry under eyes so much
the cream is not too thick either
lots of moisture without being heavy.
needing some hydration that wouldn't cake up
probably from a mix of lack of sleep
you'll have a smooth under-eye by the end of your routine
i find that they are too oily for my skin
using this eye cream completely got rid of them
i sometimes even put it on extra dry areas of my face
personally i wouldn't use it as a night eye cream because it's on the light side
for me this is not too thick or greasy.
it does sink in
i certainly don't have any dryness after using
sadly everything ether only helped with the irritation or it made my eyes burn
this is the only thing that has actually been able to moisturize my eyes
i also does not sting at all if you get any product to close to your waterline or in your eye
was not sticky at all
it has a light cream texture that is not so thick that it is hard to rub in
i like that this is fairly thick for my night use
just wait for it to be absorbed into your skin first
once the dry skin was taken care of this really helped the quality of the skin around my eyes
i would say its on the non-oily side
i told them i wanted complete moisture for the under eye area
besides the fact that it's made without a lot of harsh chemicals
i really was just wanting a basic hydrating cream for my eyes since i'm in my mid-20s
does not make my eyes water
i never really concerned myself with eye moisturizer or something to protect my eyes from aging
my dryness starting going away in a day!
purchased this to mix with my retin a cream so that it wouldn't be too drying
i wake up and i no longer have those dry patches.
this eye cream is just thick enough to deliver enough moisture to last all day
which is great for days when you don't have time to wait for your moisturizers/primers to dry before putting on makeup
back in my country it's not that dry
didn't really need to use eye cream frequently
it is way too dry
it will sting a bit if too much gets in
this eye cream takes care of it almost immediately
drying me out even more
you'll get great moisture
from menlo park mall recommended this to me because not only does it hydrate it also combats crow's feet
it also does not burn my eyes which are super sensitive to even the slightest chemical
does not feel greasy
my undereyes were really dry
it absorbs quickly so you can apply make up right away
it doesn't smooth out my laugh lines as much as other creams though
no more dry eyes for me
even got rid of my milia
doesn't sting or burn.
i really like that this eye cream is ample moisture
have consistently struggled to find skincare products that neither strip my skin nor leave me feeling greasy
my skin was changing from dry to combination
s down the best i've used for tackling oily skin
t does dry it out a bit
the wash doesn't leave my face dry or red
i think it's more of a clean your face from dust
i can finally wear dewey foundations without having to worry if i will be an oil slick
it also doesn't leave your skin feeling oily or tight
does not leave it dry
not too strong so my oily skin don't turn out dry
it almost works too well because it leaves my non-oily sections a little tight
it's not a harsh cleanser which is perfect because it won't irritate your skin if you have sensitive or acne prone skin
my skin is dry one day
don't get too oily during the day
does not leave any residue on my skin
able as i have an oily skin
so far my oily skin is very minimum
my skin was typically oily one day
this does wonders for drying it out a bit
doesn't dry out my skin
also doesn't make it oily either
my skin gets oily, but also gets dry.
this helps without making my face dry
doesn't dry my skin out or make it tight
many products for oily skin leave your face feeling like a desert
i really like this formula i have oily skin
really does reduce my oil
-i love how it doesn't have any harsh chemicals-it decloggs your pores without leaving your face completely dry
it's not over drying
not dry it out
i like that it has no harsh chemicals
i find this product is the best for getting squeaky clean face
just enough moisture which is what i want
great for summertime when my skin is more oily!
i would recommend this to anyone who has normal/ combination or oily skin
no kind of primer or setting spray/powder could help my makeup not slide around or kind of melt off
my skin never feels tight or greasy after usage.
u definitely need more than just this face wash to really combat oiliness
not harsh at all but very cleansing.
without the dried out tightness that came with some of the other oil-controlling cleansers i've used
this is also not very drying
would recommend for anyone with oily skin.
i really like this cleanser since i have an oily nose which ruins my make up during the day
this cleanser will burn yours eyes so after showering i have red eyes which i really hate about this product
thinking of going for the charcoal scrub next time
i would definitely recommend this to anyone struggling with oily skin
you can tell it cleans deep
it doesn't control my oil like it claims.
fresh once i wash my face
it doesn't leave my skin tight afterwards either
origins is one of the only lines i've found that doesn't irritate my skin
it can be drying to an extent
this cleanser initially made me want to return it because my pores became more noticible
it's great at controlling my oily t-zone without drying out my skin
i would definitely get the toner now.
this does not dry my skin out, or break it out.
the dry parts don't feel like s
it's a great way to get rid of that acne without drying you out like proactiv
it does not dry my skin out
after using zero oil my skin looks
this mask does not dry down
it's definitely amazing in the winter because i have dry skin from the cold
this is in my must-have winter skin care routine.
whenever i want some extra moisture
this face mask feels like it's melting when i put it on
it must have oils in it because even when you wash it off it still feels like it's on your skin
my skin seemed less dry after a few uses.
it smells really strongly of peaches which is great if you leave it on for 10 minutes
cooler weather together with allergies has dried me out
it almost seems like i can feel it hydrating my skin while its on
even better is that it isn't drying at all!
because i typically have oily skin
i love the cream texture because i could see that my skin was drinking it up
i normally have oily skin
my face tends to get pretty dry during winter
i also swim 3-4 days a week so my skin easily get damaged from being in high chlorinated pool a lot
it provides a deep moisture to my face after i leave it on for 10 minutes
when i wash it off
this gives me a boost of moisture my skin desperately needs-especially in the winter months
this helps get some of the moisture it needs
i think a temporary surge of moisture like this is great for combination skin
i don't feel that my skin gets oily after i wash it off
i do only use it once a week since my skin isn't that dry
i knew my face would need some help with dryness
i normally avoid putting it in my oily areas
everyone suggested i try a dry skin mask.
moisture after doing this mask 2-3 times a week
my skin gets really dry in the winter
i found this mask in my quest to help my dry winter skin
the thing i possibly hate most in life is when you moisturize
i absolutely recommend this mask for anyone who has any dryness
u will get a greasy face
doesn't make it oily during day time
my face doesn't look greasy in the morning
i find it works way better this way than rinsing it off
i assume those bumps are just from dry skin
does not leave any greasy residue
my face doesn't get as shiny throughout the day
it didn't make my face look filmy after
this is also really good for cold weather or if you're constantly in high ac environments
like other people said a thin layer is all you really need
i do not feel thick or heavy to my skin
it just gives your skin enough water to make it looks better
my skin gets really dry after using the clarisonic
this is definitely not the type of mask that improves your skin overnight
my face does not feel greasy after i use it
i usually use small quantities at night as a moisturizer when my skin is in need of extra moisture
once i wash it off i can't believe my skin feels so good
not wash it off- sometimes wearing it to bed
i don't think extremely oily or extremely dry skin would like this
its thick enough to stay on your face without dripping or anything
i can also break out- i think because my skin is usually dry
after i wash this up my skin gets so ready.
i get dry skin
this mask provides the right amount of hydration so my skin doesn't feel tight yet doesn't break me out
give a lot of water to the skin with a good price
i can see my skin getting more water...
this hydrates me in a short 10 minutes just like it says on the package
give me the right amount of moisture!
it does give a bit of moisture
you can either wipe it off or rinse it off
in the winter when my skin is really dry
it doesn't give that hydration sensation if you have really dry skin it will burn a little that means that its working
because my skin was literally drinking up the mask
it does feel greasy when its on
not greasy at all
because its a skin hydrator it worked great on both people with oil skin
or people with dry skin who just need that extra nudge
it's not one of those masks that dry up
it kind of just soaks into your skin the longer you leave it on
i just rinse with a little bit of water to get the residue off
sometimes flakey skin in the winter
i would definitely recommend for those with dry skin
my face is so dry
bad that it looks like i have a terrible sun burn that is making my face peel
it's not a sun burn it's just that my skin is that dry
you can wear this product overnight
my skin gets very dry during the winter
you can wear this product overnight
my skin was not dry at all!
it's not so much a mask as it is just a thick lotion
there's no excess to make me oily
keeps me from getting as oily as i usually do
i find it also cools down my skin which feels really nice
i don't have super dry skin
no more flakey winter skin in the morning!
i tend to use as a cream overnight n my skin is soft in morning
makeup won't glide on easilyi have never found a product with this much pros in my life
i don't necessarily have oily skin
was having a tough time finding a moisturizer that doesn't cause breakout
my skin would be so shiny and feel gross.
i would break out so bad with all the excess oil on my face
i does not leave an oil residue on my face
for those who still need to moisturize their face during the summer
which doesn't make you feel as though you've just sprayed an entire bottle of perfume on your face
which is normally super super oily
however, would not recommend for dry skin.
after the first day of use i could tell this was far better than any other lotion i've used for oily acne prone skin
all of them have given me weird reactions or made me dry
sometimes my skin seemed to dry out after using it
you don't even know it is on - skin is silky!
even though this product says it's for oily skin
my face is a little dry so applying this twice is necessary
because i have oily/combination skin
the oils it does have are good for any type skin
will always been oily
unfortunately they don't make it in a squeeze tube
keeps me from getting oily
not like some of the other reviewers with severely oily skin
i stay away from anything that says dewy
it doesnt look oily either
to start off, i have oily skin.
my skin is not even close to being oily
found it to be a little too oily for my skin
i'd been complaining about oily summer skin
everyday i have to touch up on my makeup because my skin gets so oily
this product really does stop my skin from getting oily
off with this moisturizer because it keeps running out of stock
i would recommend for oily skin
definitely would recommend this product to anyone who has oily/problematic skin
it gives just enough moisture for combination skin
i feel that this along with my primer
help keep me matte throughout the work day
especially the warmer it gets outside
this moisturizer really does cut the oil production down majorly
they were too drying
bonus that the salicylic acid seems to keep my skin clear as well
recommend for anyone with tendency towards oily/combo skin
doesn't leave my skin super shiny a 30 minutes later
now that i live in the desert my skin has been trying to make up for the dryness by becoming even more oily
as far as oil control i do still get oily throughout the day
i did notice when wearing this product alone to sleep i do not wake up as oily
i would definitely recommend this to anyone with oily skin
which all of them seemed to thick or to oily
this one doesnt dry out my skin
i rotate it in to my daily skin care routine during those times of the month when my skin cycles from dry to excessively oily
it seems to help keep my skin balanced when it starts to go overboard with oil production
it is not greasy at all
it does not make my face greasy
it's the perfect super light weight for when i need some extra moisture
evening to not look like a can of canola oil
it doesn't make me oily
i also love that it has some salicylic acid since i do get break outs every now
dries quickly and is most definitely not greasy.
does not leave nasty residue.
oil free which is perfect for oily skin it's really not too heavy like other moisturizers b/c it is kind of liquidly
i found myself having to apply it twice just to make my face not feel dry
wait for it to dry
wait for it to dry
wait for it to dry
wait for it to dry
wait for it to dry
wait for it to dry
wait for it to dry
my favorite part about it is that it leaves my face so matte without drying it out
it is a light moisturizer that does not make my face feel like an oil slick
therefore i added a a few drops of water
my face is much less oily than it was with other moisturizers claiming to reduce oil
the only reason i have given this 4 stars is because i get dry patches on my skin easily
therefore i can only use this once a day because it has salicylic acid
this lotion is pretty good at controlling the excess oil for most of the day
i love how it makes my skin feel although i do find that my skin gets a little bit more oilier when i wear it than when i wear nothing on skin
it is not greasy at all
this product is not greasy
doesn't dry my skin at all
this oil is perfect for my dry
if you are prone to breaking out from oil
f you have a sunburn or just got waxed it feels wonderful
sweating or if i have a pimple or i'm breaking out after sleeping in my makeup
i wouldn't use it at night unless you live in a particularly warm or humid environment
my skin is much less oily at the end of the day
one downside i've experienced is that it doesn't leave a matte finish
i find that within about 3 hours my face is somewhat oily
this moisturizer has proved to me that it is possible to take care of your skin if you have horrible
it keeps my face non-oily throughout the whole day
my t-zone is really the only oily place
it totally changed my skin that was desperately in need of moisture
however i need a little more moisture
since there is salicylic acid in this product i think it's keeping my skin sensitive
while my skin still gets dry spots that need care
i find it give light moisture without making my skin greasy
it can be hard to rinse the product if you let it stay on your face overnight
than wash it off
i tend to have oily skin
i find that it never really dries
never feels too dry or tight on the skin like a lot of clay masks do
just the best face mask for when your skin is really in trouble
my skin didn't look or feel oily at all
was a little hesitant because i didn't want this mask to suck out all the oil from my skin
this says that it wouldn't be good for dry skin
it gets rid of about 90% of it
but it does calm the look and feel of breakouts.
i reach for this when i'm having super rough skin days because i know it won't irritate
this will keep your leftovers fresh
t doesn't dry out
anytime i feel an under the skin pimple forming i put some of the mask on the area or areas
don't recommend removing it with a washcloth like the instructions say -- that only irritated my broken skin further
what does work is to wash it off with water.
it won't dry out your skin
it doesn't over dry or irritate my skin
it does not dry your face
while i don't normally like spending this much on a bottle for my face
doesn't irritate my skin at all
i normally have combination skin so sometimes when my skin is over-dry i breakout as well
it's the only clay mask that doesn't suck the life out of my skin
very dry in the winter
unless you're oily everywhere i would just apply where needed as it can be a bit drying
it does a great job of clearing my skin without drying it out
it's even better for just your pimples to apply over night it just dries them out in going to end up buying the full size
it doesn't dry out like other masks
i like to use this in troublesome areas because i have combo dry skin with oily patches on my chin
it does make it less irritated
i feel like after 2 uses the pimple actually starts to go away
kind of hard to wash off
this mask really did dry out those stubborn pimples that had been lingering for more than a week
it seems like it might be a little drying
it's also winter so my skin is already dry
you can cover your whole face or spot treat particularly aggressive zits
it won't magically clear up all of your acne over night
get rid of extra oil
this product save my skin every time i picked too much my skin
it doens't dry my skin out like a lot of the other masks for problem skin
doesn't dry it out
doesn't leave it dry
kind of smells like rubber or asphalt or something
the worst part is that the scent sticks even after you wash it off
this does not cause any burning or irritation at all
this mask really does rescue your skin.
it tends to linger even after you've washed your face
i especially love it if i notice my skin is looking a little bumpy before applying makeup
you need something intensive to rescue your skin again
or any other big day causing you stress
i don't normally get under the skin
almost like vics on your chest when your sick?
i find that when i use this product when my skin is at its worst it really calms my skin down
i personally can't use it all over my face because it would dry my skin out
spring as the weather / humidity changes
just a damp cloth-don't need a lot of water
doesn't make skin feel dry
when you use it as a full mask
you may also see that your skin is less oily
since it's so quick its really easy to put on in the morning while brushing your teeth or something
if there is a black residue it means you have used too much- you only need 4 little dabs around your face because a little goes a long way
my skin doesn't feel too dry
great for oily people that have big pores without drying you out
i do need a little moisture boost in drier climates
which i think would make it more suitable for oilier skins
gets wind burn a lot
love how it makes my skin feel as its drying
it does not leave your face sticky or have that dry weird feeling after you apply it
it makes my skin so smooth i've noticed that when i don't use this my makeup down look as good
because it is a black moisturizer it's best to use little or none at all in the morning as it does have a ashy look
my skin type is combine dry in winter
it took me a long time to get around to trying boscia black hydration gel
this is the first moisturizer i've found that does not leave me feeling as though my face is going to slide off in the heat
delivers enough hydration to where i don't feel oily whatsoever in the morning
the black also disappears into nothing unless you don't moisturize it into your face enough
it works very good at not drying out the parts that need moisture
keeps my t -zone controlled also skin feels so soft i use at night
it does feel slightly cooling on the skin.
i've never gone through a moisturizing product that quickly before- i couldn't even time it because the jar is completely opaque
it's hard to find a good moisturizer that doesn't break you out so easily
or leave your face more oily than before
the t dryer it's not oily at all
i got nervous thinking it would leave a tint or the shimmer would either irritate or be too 'sparkly'
not have to worry about waiting for it to dry before applying makeup
only on the areas that tend to get pink for me
someone had mentioned that there's actually less than 1 oz of moisturizer if you removed it all from the jar
i like when i don't feel the presence of my moisturizer on my face after i apply it
definitely helps to keep you from producing less oil without giving you dry skin
this really does make your pores appear smaller
i do not like the packaging because i feel like i sometimes over push the amount of product out to the surface
this is my go-to moisturizer for when we've been having exceptionally humid weather or for when i've been slacking on my diet
i've never worn moisturizer my whole life from bad experiences breaking out
can't wait to try the rest of the charcoal line.
this the one moisturizer i've used that does the job without leaving my face oily
it also works well on my dry skin.
it even gives it a bit of cooling effect
not this one after i wash my face i
i can definitely tell my pores are getting smaller
recommend this product to anyone with dry skin.
not something for people with ultra dry or dry-combo skin
even though i have oily
my skin tends to get extremely dry at night especially in the winter
not make me too oily or break out
never gets oily and never dry.
just a light layer will do
i never get greasy
not greasy at all!
i get super oily
i would only recommend this for oily or combo skin though because it is lightweight
tip- if i ever get a dry patch in the winter
anyone with acne knows it's hard to balance keeping your skin from being too oily then the products to keep the oil away can dry you out so much that your skin is flaky
i put in my fridge as i live in a hot climate
however, this is not for dry skin at all.
i would recommend this for oily skin only.
when you have oily skin
it feels cooling when you put it on
i like that it is not at all oily
light enough that my face stays oil free
is not oily at all
it don't look all super dry like it usto
it's not sticky or oily.
i highly recommend this if you have oily skin
my skin was completely dry before using this product
i swear there is more product in the jar somewhere
i get really dry skin after washing so this was a match made in heaven
it doesn't leave my combo skin oily or dry.
the bottle almost forces you to use too much.
it manages to consistently provide the right amount of moisture without leaving your face feeling greasy nor heavy creamed
i feel like it's more of a heating gel
doesn't leave a sticky residue like a lot of moisturizers do
not oily at all
not only does it do this but it hydrates my skin.
let the gel come up
good product but could be a bit thicker.
i couldn't use eyeliner anymore without making it worse
it has rid me totally of all the dryness within a week
while my wrinkles won't disappear-no cream will do this-my eye area looks better
eye creams are a tricky product as you don't normally see results immediately as you would with something like a serum
i usually struggle to find an eye cream which would well moisture skin under my eyes as it suffers from dryness rather then anything else
my other much more expensive creams won't too
the best thing about this eye cream is that it doesn't irritate my eyes
doesn't sting like so many other eye creams do
it was hard to find one that didn't irritate my sensitive skin or make me break out
i can't use retinol eye products because they are too harsh on my drier skin
i've had a hard time finding eye creams that don't bother my sensitive eyes or sting my skin
i don't find it to be greasy at all.
non greasy products when you live in a humid state is ideal
as long as you stay thin with the layer you are applying this is a great product
it doesn't provide quite enough moisture to use on its own
the product does not irritate my eyes
the price isn't bad when you compare it to other eye creams out there
it goes on so lightly
i do notice a little burning
when it drys there is no irritation
this is not a heavy or oily product.
if you want immediate moisture
instant gratification when watching lines literally disappear as you apply it
i can wear this every day without feeling like i slathered something greasy around my eyes
am finally getting serious about eye creams -- this goes on easily
it isn't drying out or hurting my eye area
give my skin a break from everyday use
this gets rid of them
it's not drying even to the parts of my face that tend to get extra dry
i really like these pads.
if you like a strong peel, get these!
while i do find that it is helping with getting rid of some dry patches
does not do much for moisture
or if you have dry skin
i dont have really damaged skin
i know this is mostly from the silicone
pretty quickly after washing your face
it will sink it pretty completely
not oily, but more so than the spot corrector
serums are always a tricky one to review as my skin is different from yours
my skin doesn't feel better or worse for having applied it
doesn't weigh down my skin
let it soak in
it even seems to give an added moisture boost too
knew that i wanted to buy either the serum or a night cream for my skin
my skin gets really dull looking during the winter
now even when i miss a day my skin stays soft
i actually use this product for my oily skin.
my foundation also seems to be lasting longer without reapplying loose powder throughout the day
my skin gets really dry in winter
i put moisture surge over it on my dry spots.
pretty quickly after washing your face
it will sink it pretty completely
it doesn't make my skin oily
i recommend this product for people with my skin type or people with dry skin
i live in a super dry climate
would recommend it to everyone with dry skin
not sure is this would work for people with oily skin
this has never broken me out when i had much more oily skin
i currently have much drier skin now
this is one of the few products that keeps the moisture all day until the end of the night when i have to cleanse my skin
i remember feeling that this might be too greasy
sticky when i first used it
7 oz that i usually get lasts me good 5-6 months
i would highly recommend for your dry skin.
tend to get dry patches during the winter
takes quite some time to absorb/sink in to the skin
nothing has moisturized my skin as well as moisture surge intense while at the same time sinking in
not making me look greasy throughout the day
it has helped so much with my dry patches
it does make my skin very tacky until it absorbs into the skin
i recommend this to anybody who has dehydrated skin
the smell goes away as soon as you put it on your face
i don't find it to be sticky
nor do i find that it leaves my skin with any sort of oily feeling
it would definitely be too heavy for me for the summer thanks to the humidity
it is just what i need for the dry gas heat of winter
the regular moisture surge is still my favorite
turns extremely dry in the winter
great for extra dry skin
let my face absorb it all up
i stop itching as soon as i lather my face in this stuff
might be too thick to moisturize before makeup as it takes a bit it set in
this is a great day cream for those of us with dry winter skin
it's almost like my skin is drinking up the product as it sits on my face
annoying flakey patches of skin that are so tough to get rid of
clinique moisture surge intense is just what i needed to perk up my face
this is the only thing that was able to get rid of my dry patches
i literally haven't had a dry patch or flakiness on my skin ever since i started using it
that can really dry out my skin
it is like my skin just drinks it up!
i find that this is one of the best products out there for severely dry skin
it completely gets rid of the mild flakiness i have on the chin area
my skin can get fairly dry
after having ridiculously dry skin in the winter since moving to nyc
a must have even if you think you are oily or greasy
i can still apply foundation over the tackiness flawlessly so really it's not an issue unless you have to touch your face
you really only need about a fingertip full for your face each time
i find that it absorbs quickly if my face is a touch damp- like right out of the shower
if i need a bit of extra moisture that day
absolutely love that it doesn't leave an oily residue or make my skin feel greasy
can even be too hydrating if you use too much
it is a little sticky like people say
was a bit too oily for day time use
night when you need lots of moisture to your face
this is the only thing that clears the dry
i never knew that's for people with oily skin
my very dry skin wasn't suited to their skin care until they came out with moisture surge
it was not heavy or greasy
my go-to product for all my winter-skin blues
if you are one if those whose desperate to find a moisturizer for dry skin this is it
no dry skin 4 me.
don't know how i've gone through the heat
beach weather for so long without this product
i didn't like it that much in the end due to the scent
so far it really feels good on my skin not too greasy just the perfect amount of moisture
it can be too moist for some more oily-type ppl
the only reason for only 4 stars is that is doesn't always play nice with other toners can make you greasy if its not the right combination
i feel my skin can still breath
my skin feels like it's drinking water....no lie.
one year nothing would keep the dry patches
flakiness away until a bought this
especially my face is really dry
it doesn't make me oily though
i wasn't completely satisfied with the original product because my skin would still get flaky
peeling in the winter this new version for very dry to dry combination skin is the best
i always tend to break out or become an oil slick after application
i like this in the winter when it's really dry out
found it didn't quite quench my skin like i had wanted
it doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy the next day or cause me any breakouts which i love because i have very sensitive skin
i don't have dry skin.
it felt so drying
i appreciate that because it keeps my skin protected during my commute
when i found myself drying out from other creams i was trying
i wanted to try the moisture surge extended due to the fact that i don't like the chemical smell of the moisture surge intense
the rest of my face gets tight no matter what cleanser i use at times
you don't wake up with a greasy face
this is the only one that relieves the dryness for a looong time
winters can be extra drying for my combo skin
this really is going to be best for people with extra dry skin to dry
i only use it when i'm needing extra moisture for my skin
if you are dry to the point where you have flaky patches
great for dry or aging skin
i live in a very dry climate
i needed more moisture than usual.
tired of the greasy serums that just sit there
it doesn't make more oily.
watery so you only need one pump to cover your face
but i couldn't stand the stickiness of most.
stopped the dry winter skin from even developing
i mean it makes my skin actually puke out blackheads i have had forever
i feel like my skin really drinks it up
nor does it aggravate my skin
i've always thought "you get more for your money with anti aging serums" this stuff is amazing
less than 10% humidity in the air
no matter what humidity in the air
it didn't soak in well
it can dry up other areas!!
at my age was concerned about this serum being drying
you feel your eyelids to move when you pass this serum
not just on the surface
sometimes i let it sink in
if you put in on your lid
i still have skin more prone to oily than dry
she did not have the means in her day to take measures to avoid the loss of firmness in the eyelids
there aren't too many products that you can use on your eyelids
it literally does not need much just a dab
got to see just how bad wrinkles are
i tried other eye creams in the hopes that they'd work
can't be without this cream
in the summer i don't use another eye cream with it
sometimes i even pat a little extra after i finish my makeup to moisturize a little extra
does anyone know if my use of a moisturizer on top of this serum is hurting or helping the effectivness of this product?
you can actually feel this product tingle on your lids
i hate anything that feels too greasy or heavy around my eyes
"did you just get your brows done?"
it just wasn't enough moisture for me
depending on how dry your skin is
it's not meant to be used alone as a moisturizer by itself
unless your skin is oily enough that it doesn't require moisturizer after application
otherwise you're wasting your money on expensive hydrating products that will wind up sitting on top of said dry
does not make my oily t zone more oily
it would definitely give that bit of moisture relief without any added oiliness
so be sure your foundation has sun protection
gives me additional moisture where my combination skin needs it
which doesn't cause me to be red
my skin tends to get shiny through the t-zone
i apply this serum right after i wash my face or get out of the shower
does not make me break out or oily
this leaves my skin so soft i can't even believe.
the air is very dry
they've never been enough because i get very dry around my lips
definitely keeps my face from drying out
my dry/oily combination skin receives just enough moisture with this product alone
most moisturizers tend to sit on top of my t-zone
making my face look like an oil slick
chin while not making too much extra oil in the t-zone
it's definitely not drying them out like another serum i used
it is not oily at all
it places moisture where i need it
takes away from where i am oily
i started to get dehydration lines around my mouth which was not attractive for me
put it in my skin care routine
doesn't leave your face greasy like some serums can
i am 44, but still break out from oily products.
it gives a lot of moisture without being greasy or shiny
even though my skin is so dry
only a little dab is needed for the whole face
this really does quench
i typically combine it with the goat milk moisturizer when it is extremely cold
it heats up a little when you rub it into your face
it doesn't leave my face dry or red like some other cleansers do
this does not dry it out or make it tight
i think this is great for pulling out impurities
this is the only cleanser that keeps my skin from getting oily all day without over drying my skin or causing break out
my skin has gone from dry to oily
i also love that it gets warm because it helps to open my pores
get all of the dirt
i am dry with break out prone skin
i like to use this in the morning because having combination skin my tzone gets really oily
it also doesn't leave me skin dry after cleaning.
my face is not greasy at all
didn't make it dry
making my skin much less oily throughout the day
i tend to get oiler as the day goes on
my skin does get very dry sometimes in summer
it really does get warm when you rub it in your h
i still get oily
my make-up doesn't clog up in my pores as soon as i put it on now which is a huge improvement
the product gets really warm before you use it
while i feel like this product doesn't get particularly foamy or work up to a very goo lather
my face tends to get oily over night
it is gentle enough to use twice a day.
it doesn't ever dry my skin out to where i'm faking
just wish it really cleaned out my pores like i had hoped
i feel like its shrinking my pores which im not complaining about
just wish it lathered up a bit more.
it doesnt help me control my oils
it does warm up
it did clear up my skin
i love the warm sensation when you first use it too
don't find myself reaching for this product so often because it is very sticky sometimes
decided to start the search for the best cleanser to tackle those little beasts without aggravating my sensitive
after time i threw it out because i don't like the idea of the sponged filled with gunk
as a naturally super oily person
then very dry if i would wash the face 2x a day
doesn't make my face oily nor dry.
not take away all the moisture or cause any sensitivity
it was not oily or dry.
i don't see my face as oily as much now
i love the warming effect as you cleanse
for sure will forever be my face wash
since using it my skin hasn't been oily nor dry
t warms up when you use it which is not only fun
i still have shine peeking through during the day i'm also finding a good moisturizer for it other than that it's a nice cleanser
doesn't strip my skin or leave any residue
this one cleans really well without being too harsh
i like this because it doesn't dry out my skin
it turns grey-ish when you keep rubbing it on your face
the smell wasn't overcoming or nasty like most things on here
remove the residuals of my oil based cleanse without making my skin feel tight or dry
this does warm up a little when lathered between your palms or on your face
this does not dry out my face
it doesn't over dry
you can feel it getting warmer as you rub it around
also since i have large prose i really have to make sure that i rinse my face extremely well
use a toner to get all the product off or else it will sink in
when your start to use you can feel little hot
it is little foamy because they didn't put any harsh ingredients
it does warm when applied to the skin.
this product helped clear up my skin in a short amount of time without drying my skin
it warms as soon as you put some on
ever since i started using this my skin is much less oily
usually tend to break out
it's like drinking a glass of water with your face
the oily parts are really oily
the finish it would leave on my skin would be too shiny for my taste during the day
drier skin might need an additional
like i do sometimes even with my very oily skin
made the large pores disappear completely making make up look so much better
this product you can even apply on your eyelids
forehead wrinkles didn't go away until now with this i saw good results i guess this is made for my skin
only plastic surgery is really going to lift your skin
i would give it 3 stars if it moisturized without causing a reaction
not only is it very moisturizing without being heavy or greasy at all
i definitely hydrates my skin very well throughout the night because i have pretty dry skin around my nose
definitely recommend this for someone with dry/combo skin like me
i tend to have oily skin
it calms my sensitive skin- it got super dry after i moved to colorado
i think that has to do with more moisture as some dryness
which makes me feel better about all the nutrients being soaked into my skin instead of being all over my pillow like most moisturizers
i find it a little lacking in moisture, though.
my oh creams are just a little too heavy for warmer spring
not sure why it's so heavy compared to other products' jars
my skin doesn't crimp up now that i don't use retinol any more
without making me feel greasy at the end of the day
doesn't make my face feel oily or greasy etc
so having a moisturizer that doesn't cause more oil is a must
i even use it as eye cream when i want to go to bed quickly
not greasy at all
if i don't blend it in enough then sometimes it will show near my upper cheeks
when i used eye creams after a couple hours they were dry agin
my skin doesn't tolerate a lot of lotions nor oils without offering up a big clogged pore in response
this does not provide enough moisture for me
you could even pinch the loose part
it gets really sticky
not too heavy feeling to layer on my makeup afterwards
i found that i needed a little more moisture
not sticky at all
sometimes it does seem to sting or irritate my skin a little bit
can use on eyelids too which is really great.
though if i use eye primer i feel like there's too much "on" my skin
this product definitely helps with oil control while still giving my skin the moisture it needs
not so "cream" that it gives you a greasy slick
if i use too much in the morning my face can appear borderline greasy throughout the day
it doesn't make it flare up
my t-zone lasts longer without getting oily
no matter rain or shine this cream has kept my face looking
i would not recommend it as an eye cream to younger people as it is too drying
dont apply too much or your skin will have a slight balmy feel
i read that moisturizers that come in jars become inactive quicker because each time you open it its beneficial ingredients degrade
i get very oily through my t zone
definitely suggest something more potent for dry skin for a night cream
maybe not great for super dry skin
some moisturizers will have me looking like an oil slick when i get up in the morning
it definitely helped keep blemishes to a minimum without drying out the rest of my face
the only possible downside would be i felt a slight tingling sometimes when i would use it after exfoliating
won't be too oily
that is still to oily for me
the best parts about this product is that i feel it doesn't skimp on the moisture
good moisture but doesn't feel greasy!
i couldn't have been more pleased that this gel cream never made my skin more oily then dry
i barely get oily.
i still get a tab bit oily
it helps me through the day to keep my face so much less oily than it usually is
i don't seem get oily as a result of this product
it doesn't leave any sticky residue
maybe that's normal because i really don't use very heavy moisturizers since my skin is already oily
this is the only moisturizer that balances everything without being too light or too greasy
my skin is getting thirstier even in the summer
didn't make me more oily
didn't help the oiliness too much
not for my skin apparently
i tend to have oily skin.
i feel like it has a good matifying effect as soon as it sinks into the skin
t doesn't feel like a greasy mess on your face
non sticky just feels right
i really like this product except for on my t zone which gets oily says its for combo to oily skin
i would recommend this to anyone who has oily or combo skin
definitely recommend it to anyone with oily skin
i rarely get oily
i hate heavy creams that make your skin feel like it's being suffocated
without feeling greasy or too heavy
isn't so thick that it makes my face feel oily after i use it
this product is not greasy
it keeps the usually oily parts under control
i would recommend for those of us who ooze a little more during the summer months
this product does not leave me oily
for years i've been trying to find the right moisturizer that won't leave me shiny or greasy
it really solves the oil problem without drying out the other areas of my face
also hydrate all the horrible dry patches i have on my face
though it takes a moment to sink into my skin
not be heavy or greasy
it smells like it should be a body moisturizer or that it would break me out
my face started becoming really oily
i notice that people with oily skin are using it
with a nice finish -not greasy or heavy feeling at all
t's perfect for my oily areas
i don't feel greasy at all throughout the day.
low for something anything to keep me matte all day
i get dry patches in the winter
doesn't leave an obnoxious oily shine afterwards
this makes it all disappear
does not leave me feeling greasy yet plenty of moisture
i still have to blot the oil
i decided to give this moisturizer a try after several others left my skin feeling way too greasy
doesn't make my skin feel extra oily
highly recommended this to people with oily skin you won't regret purchasing
dry skin everywhere else
i don't typically have dry skin
i tend to get very oily in my t-zone
i hardly have to use blotting papers to soak up the oil throughout the day
this moisturizer has helped that too because there is less oil to clog up my pores
there is nothing better for oily skin.
i would recommend this to ppl who have dry or dry to normal type of skin to purchase
a lot of people with oily skin dehydrate it by not giving it enough moisture which in turn makes your skin produce more oil
moisturizers tend to make me breakout if i use the same one too long
i am not sure about the "matte finish" here as after a couple of hours my face gets a bit oily
no break outs or dry patches from it either
moisturizes all day long in all the right spots- i never see dry patches when i've applied this
it is great at giving my skin the perfect about on moisture so that my skin feels less oily throughout the day
i just wanted to fix the extreme dryness
she confused me so now i'm going to try the oil free vitamin face base
i started a medication that dried out my normally oily to combination skin so bad
be sure to warm in your h
chicago winter my skin gets really dry
it's a must where i live in such extreme cold
have tried everything under the sun to remedy my skin
this is definately not for someone who has oily skin
it is truly made for those who live in drier climates
you may not like the texture of this balm.
takes too long to sink in for their liking
this stuff is heavy and very sticky.
usually powerful creams like this make me break out
very dry everywhere else
in the morning i use one of the lighter bobbi brown creams instead as this balm as it takes a long time to absorb
i get very dry skin areas
i know its not an eye cream
i applied it thinking it was a normal cream
warm this between your fingers before applying it for an even distri
it is difficult to rub it in it is so thick
or people who want a thicker
i too say that you must warm the balm between your fingers before applying
em with the extra face oil
the balm is a different type of product that must be warmed between my h
i top it off with the oil on especially dry patches
perfect for parched winter conditions.
makes dry skin a thing of the past.
it definitely did not soak in
anything light weight doesn't help me in the winter
i will say it is very thick so you have to warm it in your h
it also goes on looking greasy for a bit while it sinks in so maybe wouldn't be good for combination skin
make your skin more even
with continued use over the next few weeks it also hydrated my dry patches better than anything else
at night i like to replenish my skin with moisture without getting overly greasy
is not greasy at all
you wake up with great skin.
it not leave the skin oily
my skin is usually oily except for winter when its combo
soft even in that gross dry airplane air that usually makes my skin feel super dry
tends to get dry patches all over my face
it does give a nice finish from an overnight soak on the face
also not oily or greasy feeling
i notice that my skin seems more smooth when i use this regularly
i noticed i didn't wake up grease like i did with aqua bomd
some of it super oily while some of it can get pretty dry
this stuff is lightweight enough that it doesn't make my skin feel greasy
i tend to finish it
it's a nice moisturizer that doesn't feel sticky on my face when i put it on
i find it fades rather quickly though.
it can also be a little thick
i can see it being too much for those with oily or combo skin
not so much so that its sticky or suffocating
my normal to oily skin usually requires something lighter
glowy without being too greasy
my skin gets a little sensitive if i use it every day
it gets dry super quickly
it really doesn't feel like i've slept with a facial mask on all night
it did tingle a little after i applied it
didn't burn my face
as someone with highly acne prone skin it did not cause me to break out either
i didn't think it would help since generally hypo pigmentation does not go away
not an unnatural over the job glow like a lot of the newer skin care products have
it does leave an oily film.
lightly wet the cream on your face
i usually spread it on dry face
then add a bit of water
does not leave a residue
doesn't break out my extra-sensitive skin.
sometimes it really stings my eyes- i'm totally willing to put up with that though because i love this cleanser so much
apply it to your skin
as you wipe it off with the included cloth you will see soft
great if you want washing your face to feel like more of a spa experience
i think this is best as a morning cleanse for very dry skin
how well it cleaned my skin
it does sting a bit when you get it in your eye while trying to remove eye makeup
only complaint is that it feels like it leaves a film after rinsing which you can only remove with a wet cloth
i tend to use the product mostly to give my face a 5-min massage after a long day as a pick-me-up
it can burn around the eyes so be careful.
not greasy when i wash my face
finding the dry patches are getting drier
your skin will feel like a babies bum afterwards which is a total plus
i tend to be dry/combo
add a bit of warm water work it into the skin some more
this doesn't dry out my face
s with very hot water
let it sit before rinsing it off
also note that if you use this in a really hot climate
when i used this i lightly wet my face
it balanced my skin out like nothing before
this cleansing balm help me get all of it off with no trouble
in order to use this product you would take enough of the product to lather onto your skin
don't use any water
the product will lather up once you add the water
then you could rinse it off
this product felt a little oily after i put it on
for some reason my skin finds them too heavy or something
i personally couldn't use it for that purpose because it burns my eye area very badly
it didn't really leave the oily film as other reviewers said
i see much less whiteheads on my t-zone
it didn't horribly dry out my face or make my very sensitive skin break out
then i felt like i would just wash it all away with my cleansers
this product does not strip my face of any moisture
fearing that it would make me oilier
this product is gentle enough to be used on your eyes
rub it all over your face
it's also not drying at all
not only does it get all the dirt out of my pores
i love the way my skin feels once it's been rinsed off
just be careful around the eyes to rinse well
at the end of my shift i need lots of help getting the impurities off
i apply it to my dry skin
then i get my clarisonic brush wet
was annoyed with how runny it was
i like how you massage the balm onto you face for a few minutes
it's a part of my beauty philosophy to not spend a lot of money on cleansers because they only stay on the skin for a few moments
this is perfect for winter skin that is simply dying for moisture
it's also really important to use a cloth with this to remove the product completely from around the eyes
i never use the cloth it comes with just splash
if your any skin type with tightness after you cleanse then you need to own this
t would seem this cleansing balm would be a perfect match
then this balm might work for you
very oily in the summer
meaning no cold liquid going on my face
love how my skim feels afterwards
in the summer it is combination to oily
in the winter it is very dry
this has been the best face wash for me this winter
i plan to use it through the summer for the moisture
soft morning skin- that is what this balmy cleanser leaves you with
doesn't leave my skin with any oil residue
even though i'm definitely on the oilier side
i will never go back to foaming cleansers which dry you out needlessly
to anyone who has trouble getting it off your not using the proper temp water to get it off with
doesn't leave my skin with any oil residue
i don't typically take the huge container with me because it takes up so much room in my makeup bag
a lot of them will cause my skin to get really flushed
or worse burn it
my skin tends to break out
i can't stress enough that this balm is great for us "oily" girls too
the balm formulation is great for travel as you don't have to worry about accidental spills
this doesn't make my t-zone oily at all
really not more then a pea size otherwise it is to much
the only reason it didn't get five stars is because it stings my eyes a little if i rub it too close when i'm taking mascara off
it comes with a cloth that i'm not sure i like
everything made my skin worse.
not clean at all
it really does not matter if you use the muslin cloth included or a washcloth as long as it is wet with very warm to hot water
your skin does not feel oily after
conditions your skin so quickly
it's great if you have dry skin
need something to give you extra moisture
i like how it makes my face more filled out
i want to found of the wash or over night cream.
whenever my face needs an extra boost of moisture i use this
my skin is not usually dry
it comes out more like a watery foam that you kind of pat around your face
i do find that it does provide aging skin with good hydration if used properly
don't always cleanse my skin at night so the effects are taking a toll
its a gotta have if you are keeping away from peels etc
without being any sort of heavy or greasy feel
which you usually get with something so quenching
seems to use some type of dry freeze
totally different type of application than any other product- something refreshing about the cold crisp delivery onto your face
the moisture feeling doesn't go away
i would bathe in it if i could!
i think this will lessen the need for the botox in the areas i usually get done because the skin is so hydrated
this is one of the only products that helps my dry skin
my t-zone has not been oily at all.
for those of you who have dry skin you know how hard it is to find a product that not only moisturizes on a high level
this past winter my skin got so dry it was itching
it immediately helped with dry areas of my skin.
without leaving it oily
my face is beginning to get just a bit dry in places
during the winter i need something heavier
this product gives my skin the moisture it needs without making my skin break out
with no oily or greasy feel at all
it's great to have in your beauty arsenal when you need a little more moisture
doesn't make the skin greasy
i knew my t-zone was just craving more moisture.
i usually just wear it to bed
not of the oil though
not greasy at all
i can have combination skin at times where it gets oily throughout the day
i find it a little too rich for the humid summer days
- doesn't dry out skin- cleans makeup as good as boscia product- doesn't dry out skin- good solution
i also use this during the day over the truth serum in place of my sunscreen if i know i'm not going outside
the rest of my face is dry
i tend to get very dry skin around my nose
didn't make me break out in oily areas
if your face looks oily you probably added too much
it's a cream to try if you hate the feeling of having your pores clogged after applying a thick
good moisture without being heavy.
switch to something lighter in summer when humidity provides more moisture naturally for my combination skin
i don't believe this crème could lighten my scars on it's own
probably best for dry skin.
the product doesn't lie when it say it promotes cell turnover because it felt like i was getting a new silky face each day using it
well worth the price as not only does it actually brighten your skin
this is the only moisturizer i can use that's effective without breaking me out
i mostly use at night due to my oily skin.
doesn't feel oily or heavy!
this is my one stop skin care
definirtly a product worth trying if you have dry skin
my skin is no longer dry or flaky.
better that than dry
does wonders for my dry skin in the winter
does give my normal/dry skin good moisture
it seems like it's light enough for me to use as a daily moisturizer during these dry winters
might be too rich during the summer when it gets hot or humid
i would prefer this to be packaged in a tube or pump bottle because it's a lot more liquid than solid
my skin has been extra dry this winter
i apply it lightly
on really dry windy days even add a second application in the extra dry spots
the sales person put me onto this cream in combination with one drop of the ole henriksen facial oil
was worried about the oil/cream combination
in that i give my face some time to absorb the cream before applying make up
a tendancy to get dry with season changes
after i tried a sample which lasted 4days i had to get this stuff it givs my skin a naturally glow
mportant since the humidity in the desert is next to nothing
it does absorb well
i imagine some might find it a little greasy as once it soaks in
no more dry areas
if you put it on your temples
it does the trick to put you into a calmer state of mind
i tend to get a very oily t-zone
always feel the need to wash my clothes immediately afterward
plus you only need a dab so the product lasts quite long
when i feel myself starting to tense from stress or get achy from the weather
the tiny bottle will last forever unless you apply very liberally
just an amazing little thing you can carry around with you to rub on your temples or neck when stressed
you'll notice a cooling sensation where you apply
just make sure not to rub your eyes.
wouldn't blend on my skin at all
this serum is a must for anyone who lives in a humid client that leaves you with the shine
so your face doesnt melt as soon as you walk out the door
if you at least get occasional breakouts
i knew that my skin seemed a lot less oily when i used it
my face is dry
i can get a little oily in the t zone
not drying at all!
the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is that if it is hot enough to make me sweat it can clog pores
my face won't look oily at all
it is not thick
it does not clog your pores or cause you to break out at all
sometimes i don't even put moisturizer over it because it's hydrating enough to be worn alone
i can say my skin is pretty much normal with the exception that it gets a little dry during the winter
maybe is because my complexion has never been oily
i don't longer wake up with an oily face
your face can look a little shiny from too much product
my skin gets oily at work.
it helps control oil without making the skin dull
as it turns out to be a bit too drying
if you also have a t-zone that is oily halfway through the day
i find that as it gets rid of unnecessary shine
so far it's helped with my oily skin
can't tell any difference in my pore size or any toning on my skin
at least it does what i need which is to keep my oily skin under control
i like it more than koh gen do's oriental plants cream because the pump for this product is much more sanitary than having to dip your fingers into the cream everyday
s that get super sticky rather than the face
it doesn't feel that sticky at all on your face
sinks in easily and not greasy at all.
it moisturizes my face without making me oilier in my t-zone later on in the day
theres no harsh chemicals or anything.
you don't have to use a lot to get great moisture that lasts all day
dry patches if i don't use the right product
it goes on your skin
you can tell it seals all the moisture in
or when your skin is feeling dry
you wear it to bed
otherwise it won't turn to foam itself in your h
i also don't have to hide down my face with water to get the face wash off
the cleanser is awesome you hardly need a pea size of product for each use as it foams pretty well
doesn't leave my skin dry
you get the full effect of the wash
i feel like i have to keep rinsing like there's still product on my face
can be a little drying
doesn't leave my skin dry/tight
it does not feel drying after use
it is unlike anything i have ever used- the actual product comes out like a thick lotion or paste
when i touch my face after i use it there is no residue or oil
the only think i can liken it to is when you wash your hair
so you have oily or combination skin type
not sure how it works on dry skin tho
is there anything worse than a tacky or sticky moisturizer that doesn't dry down?
so that i get more moisture
just warm it up on the sides of your eyes where the skin isn't so thin
you do get a lovely cooling feeling when applied.
just make sure it has a chance to dry before going over it with any foundation or i find it migrates into your eye
cold spoons do the same trick for less
dont apply many layers of it though 2 sweeps under each eye is what i do
idk how they did it bc usually anything minty burns my eyes
you can even apply over makeup if you start feeling dry or puffy
can live with out is that it can feel a bit heavy over your bags
if you just rub some on your finger tips it takes too long to get enough product to cover my eyes
this product is perfect for getting rid of those puffy eyes whenever you haven't had enough sleep
it is more cooling than any cream i've tried.
i keep it in the fridge for extra cooling.
i keep it in the fridge to keep it extra cool.
this balm does exactly that.
if you just look exhausted
i prefer it to a specific eye cream because i tend to rush beauty routine
not irritating or heavy.
it is gentle enough to use right from the tube.
it goes on super easy and it instantly cooling.
keep in in the fridge which makes it extra cooling
does not sting or burn eyes
i don't have issues with dry skin
this eye balm should be in every woman's make-up bag
this has a little sheen that some might not like
clarins always makes my acne go away somehow
i won't be using any other face cream
skin care lines bc her skin feels it right away if the cream is watered down or really rich
not at all oily
usually i wouldn't like such a strong scent because they might sensitize my skin
or when i am in a dry climate
neck creams because i'd been struggling for years to find a moisteriser that doesn't break me out
so during the winter as my skin gets drier
i ended up having to use it as night cream because it is just too rich for combination skin types
i am 37 with skin that is starting to get dry
it gives me the right amount of moisture without feeling greasy
i realized that my skin used to be dull as well
get lots of compliments on my skin
it provides moisture without giving it too much.
i can't say it brought my skin back to dry/normal condition
beware, the smell can be putting off.
but it does work on oily/combo skin.
might be drying for those with dry skin/ dry patches
i couldnt use it in the winter my skin was very dry
i do not wear foundation or powder unless it's a special occasion
not greasy at all
"fillers" which may make the skin appear nicer
whenever i want to 'detox' from the chemicals
it works well with my 50 something normal to dry skin
this is the best even for my sometimes dry skin
leave it to my skin to fall in love with such an expensive br
which disappears as soon as you wash your face
my face actually feels balanced which is rare since most moisturizers seem to tip my skin one way or the other
wanted something light enough to wear daily in a warm part of the country
i shudder to think how dry the other reviewer's skin must be if she's forced to use a heavy night cream to get any moisture during the day
you can smell the cucumber which makes you feel like you are at the spa
i love that i can still feel a veil of moisture if i tap my eye area at the end of full day
unlike others that dry hard
it clears the skin but does not dry it out.
if you want clean skin without the irritation or over dryness
t does feel a little dry on
you should have seen my cotton pads
they are good it's easier to extract blackheads after
wondered if dryness was just what happens with mud masks
this product really doesn't dry out the skin
worth a try if you struggle with congested skin
don't want the prune look in exchange for clean skin
this one does not dry out my skin at all
is not as "tingling" this one is much more bearable while its on
doesn't dry your skin out at all
also comes with a little spoon so you don't use too much
this is lovely for my dried up winter skin!!
not greasy or heavy
my skin is often messed up due to different climates
which is plenty for my oily skin
i think i'll reduce that over the summer when my skin is at its oiliest
a few other oils it will have a slight oil finish to the moisturizer so that is why i apply at night only
that is an ingreident that can clog pores this is free of all of that it is so natural
they do not load it with chemicals or silcones
i love that i only need to use a tiny bit to get enough foamy goodness to wash my whole face
if it wasn't so expensive i would use it as a body wash as well
not at all stripped or dry
not a bad foam at all.
it completely took it all off- i didn't even have to get a cotton pad after for some residue cleaning
i honestly use the smallest bit to lather my entire face
it doesn't break me out or make me feel greasy.
yet i get a great foam
anything with spf is going to make your skin feel greasy
my skin does not feel heavy or sticky
my problem is that it never seems to dry.
i still see some oiliness in my t-zone on some days
for the warm weather that's coming
i apply this once a day after washing my patting my face dry with a towel
it is not greasy at all
it can also be used on your chest for those sun spots as well
i guess it's because most cosmetic companies assume that oily skin does not need hydration
since i've started using this my skin is a lot less oily
as other reviews mentioned it looks greasy when you put it on
does not break me out or feel oily on my skin
super dry during the wintertime
i never thought face oils would work on my skin type
skip juno if you have normal or oily skin
it might be too much moisture.
've been struggling to find a really good hydrating face oil
quality facial oil that actually keeps me from breaking out
that black cumin in this oil really did wonders in making my skin look decongested
found this one to be the least greasy
it did take a while to soak into my skin
my favorite part is how i can feel my face gently pulsate at night after i apply it
also a little too oily under my foundation for day use unless i want a dewy finish
the juno oil has been amazing on my dry
in the morning i don't even need to wash my face
it can get heavy so always use sparingly.
if your skin is grumpy like mine try using just one drop in your moisturizer at night every 2 days
i noticed my skin changing- becomming a bit more dry
the best ones are pure cold pressed
the best oil for the cold dry months.
this oil definitely not making my skin dry which is a good sign
the juno doesn't seem to soak in quite as quickly
chin don't overproduce oil anymore
i only use about half a pump n it covers my full face without leaving it oily like the other oils i've used in the past
oily--which is what i am-- or even dry skin
that this one is very dry
doesn't spread very easily
primers just make it sit on my skin
look cakey no matter the means of application
it does not make my skin look oily
got rid of my flakey dry patches
not to mention topical rxs that are somehow supposed to all save my skin
no joke after a couple drops of this stuff you look like someone who actually drinks 8 glasses of water a day
even though you'll want to be slathered in it 24/7
especially for cold winter time
i should be applying the oil with water
not just to damp skin in my case
treat yourself to this special oil
this oil is great it doesn't irritate my face
i reach for this oil especially as it does not have any essential oils that irritate me
occasionally in the am as well if my skin is a bit dry
my face is dry
lately i'be been feeling like i need a little more moisture
t's no longer overly oily in patches
i don't get that greasy look by 2pm that makes me feel like i need to redo make-up or reach for blotting papers
if you're prone to dry patches or have thirsty skin in general
this did not irritate my skin at all
my once-combo skin has turned rather dry
it is super concentrated so drowning your face in it will achieve nothing
i like to put it on when i do a little self-facial or when my skin is looking flat
i suppose that depends on the condition of your skin
with an oily t-zone that tends to react to almost everything
especially helpful during drier winter months
one thing that i found particularly annoying was the leaking bottle
is not oily this way
especially if you use sparingly
however i'm a little oily with some dry patches
i just use my exfoliators to get that off
this product does make my face more oily throughout the day
i simply blot my face with something oil absorbing a couple times
bright with our drying it out
this drys them out
it evens out my skin without being too harsh
anytime i feel like i might be getting some rough texture
a must in my skin care routine.
i already have oily skin
it can burn and it can be drying.
add it into your routine slowly or you'll probably "purge"
i recommend to anybody with damaged skin or dull skin because it will repair your skin as well as make you have a glow from within
if i leave it on too long or use it daily i break out in places i never normally get a pimple
with sensitive skin touch you or it will burn them
the only con is that it leaves an oily finish.
at first it does burn/sting a bit on my skin
it doesn't feel heavy or oily
my only complaint is that it can be slightly drying
take your time getting over the scent
the only thing is because this is acid it can be a little stingy for my sensitive skin
be sure to give it time to absorb before layering on other products
it can be drying and i'm super oily!
like the sort of peel that your dermatologist does that you skin falls off after
i think it has just the right amount of acid
because it really really do a great job in minimizing pores on my cheek
the products that i had used before caused me to get patches of dry skin
if you don't use acids, you need to.
the minute you apply it to your face you will feel the work starting to be executed by the tingly sensation
i don't get really itchy unless i have a fresh dark spot
it's like only my problem areas itch/burn so that tells me it is working
sometimes it can be drying in your problem areas
for everyone saying this dried them out
even if you have oily skin
there is a face oil for you
i promise you will wake up without dry patches.
then i follow it with tatcha water cream.
it gets worse with stress
i find it difficult to find products that either don't over-moisturize my already oily skin
a must try for dull looking skin.
my skin is mostly dry with normal to oily only around my nose
it doesn't dry you out or make you peel!
we perform/ sweat in it
it clogs my pores so much i would break it like when i had acne when i was 13
i am very dry in certain areas
i would recommend pairing this with a clarisonic to really get that deep cleanse
just leaving it on for a few minutes before you get in the shower or wash your face is all it takes to give you a beautiful porcelain finish
it doesn't irritate in the slightest
bottom line this is the best cleanser on the market for us combo skin 40 somethings who still experience the occasional break out
although i have oily skin
nothing irritates me more than stripping all of the natural moisture out of my skin by using a cleanser that isn't balancing
i love how it is just the right amount of foaming because anything excessive leaves my skin lifeless
it never leaves me too dry
the texture is also better than any cleanser i e tried because your face feels clean when done
i would be embarrassed to wear a highlighter because it would look so bumpy
giving the purity a break so that my skin doesn't get too used to either one
a negative is when you get it in your eyes it burn
when i feel super oily/sticky i'll use this
i think this is a bit pricey for something that's just going to be rinsed down the drain
my face didn't get oily throughout the day it just felt so refreshed
it doesn't over dry
it's a rest cleanser the different clays really feel like it's lifting everything out of your pores
i would get out of the shower
not too dry like other cleansers leave me
it controls my oily skin without leaving it dry or rough
the word clay made me think it would be a thicker substance
i usually have drier skin
humidity i can get quite shiny over the course of the day
before applying makeup or when i'm feeling particularly oily
because my skin tends to be drier
my face can easily get irritated from beauty products
it smells just like simple green household cleaner which throws me off a bit
this doesn't work very well if you're going to apply it to dry skin when cleansing
it makes it twice as clean
i like it because i didn't have to keep spraying my face with setting spray as i have a oily t zone
its more of a liquid where i thought it would be more thick
it didn't dry out my skin
doesn't feel dried out at all
still have very oily
this is finally one of the only cleansers i've found that truly dries out my skin a bit
f you feel like you're not getting the best results with the cleanser without the aid of a brush
extractions can leave my skin red or worse
with this product my pores stay clear without the cleanser being too harsh
this could just be my skin purging.
i still need to follow my regular "defeat the grease" routine
gets rid of any oil without drying out the face
i find i don't get as oily as i used to during the day
this product is great because it does not dry out my skin
this cleanser was recommended to me by someone with a completely different skin type than me
as long as i use a good moisturizer my skin does not get extra dry
didn't feel it cleaned off the make up
let your own skin shine
it keeps my skin oil free all day
because i have oily skin
once you rub it on your h
i don't feel like it has actually made my pores smaller
most cleansers that i have used for blackheads/pores have either been pretty drying or lackluster in actually balancing out the rest of my skin as well
hadn't been really cleaned with a good cleanser in a little while
then i noticed my blackheads were so bad you could see them through all of my products
low for something that keep my oily skin at bay i've finally found it
lighter moisturizers arent enough for northern cold air
with combination skin i was afraid this would make my face look shiny
not oily at all
i started with the dry/very dry formula
whenever it feels a little dry
my skin has the tendency to go oily if the wrong product is applied
i do believe its softened my "laugh lines
i love using this under my make-up because it makes my wrinkles disappear
my skin does not tolerate anything too oily or it breaks out
i do feel a bit of a tingle upon first applying
so that the cream actually penetrates in the way i would want my skin to be lifted
doesnt leave a residue or greasy feel at all
it was too dry
it goes on a little greasy
the one thing i do not like about this is that it has more of an oily texture
argan oil makes me break out but this one does´t.
i tried this based on containing retinoids which do not need to be discontinued if you are not peeling or red
i swear this stuff keeps me from getting too oily in the summer
doesn't leave any film or residue
just very lose looking skin
if my skin was dry i would use it all over my face
as i get older find they are too drying
my sensitive skin has made it difficult to find one that doesn't make me more dry or irritated
my skin doesn't get dark spots as easily as it was before i started using this
the directions say to warm 5 drops in your h
it may appear oily at first
most importantly it doesn't burn or dry out my face like some retinol products do
doesn't leave any residue behind
i found it's best to dab it on rather then rub.
it also doesn't flake or come off as that gummy residue like some products do when you apply make-up over it
wait until your other products have completely dried before applying
line fillers do a decent job of disguising them
it actually turns your face into a 'flawless canvass' for which your foundation
concealer sit perfectly upon without any of the usual issues of caking or settling into your fine lines
once it was dry
i finally found something other than those wax type
5 eye creams that i rotate on a daily basis so you can say that i've seen a bit of what's out there
it doesn't turn white when applied
doesn't notice "cakey" stuff under my eyes
using too much or reapplying
it's less than other products that claim to remove your wrinkles
it keeps my pimples away completely especially if you use the face wash that goes with it
doesn't make skin oily or too dry
it doesn't make your skin dry or tight which i really appreciate
combined with the clear days gel face wash has made my skin incrediably soft without making it oily
sometimes if my skin is excessively dry
my face doesn't get oily during the day
the minute i take a shower it becomes super dry
my skin didn't clear up
it doesn't irritate skin as long as you use the recommended amount
during the colder seasons it might be a little drying so just layer another moisturizer on top
this does dry your face up
the slightest bit of anything medicated usually leaves me red
i do use this only at night simply because i need to use a moisturizer with spf during the day or else i will burn
not too weak and not too oily.. just right !
which i prefer for my skin
my skin tends to be super dry all year since i wash it so much
tend to breakout if my skin gets too dry
if i'm dryer that day
with the humidity here
i find that it works really well at treating breakouts without making my skin freak out--no dryness
doesn't dry your skin out or leave any residue on your skin
it definitely helped with the occasional little bumps i get without irritating or drying out my skin
squeeze the amount you need out onto your finger
only concern is that this is not a moisturiser nor is its gel hydrating enough to replace your regular moisturiser unless you have really really oily skin
as i get dry skin from washing my face every day
i can use a hard face wash
doesn't make my not-so-oily nose red
may not be best for dry skin though.
that way i don't get the peely bits of skin around my nose that other reviewers have mentioned
it helps control them while giving my skin the moisture it needs
i tend to by more oily
i do not get overly dry or tight
add the moisture i need also my skin has not looked this good i also use the face wash
i don't have the oily
in the summer it's enough moisture for me
no drying at all
the winter gets pretty bad so when my skin gets really dry i do however have to use some additional moisturizer
like most people- my skin will get dry patches due to my cleanser clearing up a patch of breakouts when they occur
does not dry my skin
my combo skin gets a little dry during the winter
doesn't dry out my skin
i do not put this on dry skin
in the morning i simply rinse my face with warm water
the packaging can be better it literally falls right out of the tube
it will dry out your skin
t doesn't become too drying
doesn't dry it out
the small amoung of salicylic acid isn't too drying for me
works great not greasy yet not drying
makes your face look a bit shiny after you apply it
this stuff is amazing especially for oily skin or a dull complextion lights up face
isnt oily buy this stuff
i also liked that it didn't dry out my skin while it still helped prevent new breakouts
someone who hasn't used this type of product before may experience more flaking
do not contain alcohol to dry out my skin
this is the only moisturizer ive found that helps clear up my stubborn blemishes without making me overly dry or more oily
so you know it helps keep acne from forming during the day
this product gets rid of them so fast
the only problem is that i have pretty dry skin
ncrease your tolerance slowly if you haven't used this type of ingredient on your skin before
using this product line completely cleared it without drying out my skin
doesn't dry out my skin
clear days does not irritate my skin or cause my face to swell
doesn't dry my skin out.
it doesn't dry my skin out at all
my skin doesn't feel dried out or irritated in the slightest
it doesn't dry your skin or leave it feeling strange
the more stubborn zits will take a couple days to go away completely
doesn't over dry my skin and it can't be seen.
i usually don't use spot treatments because i felt like it was a waste since i have adult acne here
doesnt leave the greasy/takes forever to dry feeling of other similar exfoliants
my skin stays super clear when i use it!
the rest of my philosophy skin care routine
this dries my skin out a lot less than other ones
i always seem to get a huge glob come out.
you can feel the acne burning away as soon as you put it on
it go's on really nice not oily at all .
it dried out my skin which i was ok with as long as those painful pimples went away
i've tried everything to get rid of my skin problems
you can really feel it working with the stinging sensation i sometimes have with worse than normal blemishes
for me it worked over time without drying out my skin like other products
it does not dry out the skin at all
i found this to be an effective spot treatment that does not overly dry the skin
i like it because it didn't dry my skin very bad
it is amazingly fast working without irritate the skin surrounding
still "thick" at the same time where it doesn't absorb
oftentimes i'll apply it at night immediately after a shower without drying off
or dab a little on in the morning if it feels extra dry
my nose gets really dry in the winter
this is a wonderful thick moisturizer that you can easily apply make up over top of
nor did i have any globs on my skin
it doesn't make me break out or leave dry patches on my skin
yet never made my face appear greasy
the cold was drying up my skin so bad
not greasy at all
the minus fahrenheit degrees are not good on the skin at all
i live in new york so the cold weather really made my skin red
in love with this product i have very dry skin
not leaving oil on skin
i don't usually like buying products i have to stick my fingers in
not greasy or oily looking
when i get really dry
this is the only product that has brought my skin back some moisture
my dry skin was falling apart due to the dry weather
moisturizes very well without feeling heavy or greasy even during hotter summer months
this cream gives my skin so much moisture without any greasy feeling or any sort of heavy cream feeling
i occasionally get rough bumby skin or un even skin on my face
i would recommend to anyone struggling with dry rough skin
i get dry skin on my t-zone
i find that those make my skin look oily
usually within 15 minutes my skin is left dry
i definitely suggest it for anyone needing long-lasting moisture
it burns every time i use it.
doesn't feel greasy or too dewy
t doesn't get greasy or oily
doesn't leave me with a greasy residue
this cream was the only thing that got rid of my dry patches
comforting yet it sinks into the skin very quickly
i know if you have dry skin your makeup looks terrible if you don't have a good product to hydrate you face
i love feeling like i'm giving my combo skin enough moisture without oversaturating it with a heavy feeling
perfect for daytime because its fast absorbing so there's no residue
perfect for night when combined with a beauty oil to really give a super intense hydration
i went in to a sephora to look for something to put some moisture back into my shrivelled dry skin
i am in a panic because i have scraped every possible bit of this moisturizer
still it was very cold
t doesn't feel like an oily product justs sits on top
not too oily for my combination skin
i sometimes combine it with some nude or maracuja oil at night when temps dip below zero here
find all 3 can feel a bit heavy
this product is not greasy on me
would recommend either to anyone with dry skin.
i've always been dry in my t-zone
you only need one dab to get coverage for your entire face
my face is so smooth after i apply the cream.
it is lightweight without being sticky or drying like some 'lightweight' or gel formulas are
it feels like cool water going on the skin
this is the perfect skin prep -- not so heavy
my skin tends to be very dry during the winter months
if you suffer from dry skin this is a most have
in an effort to get rid of my oily skin problem
thinking it would worsen my oily skin issue
i hate moisturisers that make you look like an oil rig after applying especially applying it before stepping out of the house
i came to realise it does make my skin a little bit oily
this moisturizer has almost completely solved that problem for me without being too greasy or oily or causing any other problems
if my dry spots need a little extra help
it mosturizes without leaving my skin oily.
so i have dry skin.
when my skin is dry you can tell that it's dry.
not only was the gel so tidy
i didn't even put it in the fridge
it doesn't leave any messy liquid around
relaxing like a mask should be.
it feels amazing when you get it on due to the weight of the mask combined with the cooling sensation
i know some other reviewers didn't like the stickiness or weight of it on their eyes
it is a bit sticky
i keep mine in the fridge so they are really refreshing
so easy as there is no product to apply or finicky pads to stick on
it didn't leave behind any residue either
the best part of this mask is the requisite 20 min break you have to take due to it covering your whole eye area
it only takes 20 mins to refresh your whole eye area
haven't eaten right there is not a lot that can completely obliterate the puff
was hoping for something that could sooth my burning
definitely a great product for anyone who gets burning eyes when they're tired
certainly less hassle than holding a bag of ice on my face
not like other masks that get warm after some time or leave red marks
doesnt irritate them more or make them red
have a nice weighted feel to them on your eyes
was pleasantly surprised that it was a no-mess gel mask
they really feel like you put a cool gel pack on
they are so soothing
they are cold to the touch
i put them in a ziplock
this mask is an awesome relief for tired eyes after a stressful day or just because you feel like pampering yourself for 20 minutes
i like putting the eye mask in the fridge just before i use it to get more of a cooling effect
i work full time so can't look puffy on the job!
put in the fridge for even a cooler effect.
these eye masks really do feel better than a nap.
if you're generally sleep deprived
in the hotter weather i pop it into the fridge after purchasing
you also don't have to deal with washing them or keeping them in the fridge
so sticky, yet not.
it doesn't leak or make you wet
they stay cold forever....
don't feel as cool on your face for as long
i usually keep it in the fridge for extra refreshing feeling
regardless of how much eye cream i put on or water i drink
have found that putting these masks in the refrigerator feels very nice on my eyes
it does not dry my skin whatsoever
just give it time to work into your skin
to get my skin to this point
it's not a product that makes your blemishes disappear overnight
if you suffer from the occasional break out or small white
you only get one body.
every other night so my skin can chill
best of all it didn't dry my skin out.
it doesn't dry out my skin at all
i love knowing that when i put it on it will unclog my pores
i did use this in the winter with a moisturizer: clinique's moister surge
after i clean my face i only use this product
totally reccommend to try for those with combination/oily skin
the only reason why i took away the star is because sometimes it smells slightly chemically
it dries almost instantly so you can moisturize or put on eye cream pretty shortly after
i've also not had a problem with it drying out the skin either
you can cover your whole face with this gel twice a day without irritating it
i get the worst under-the-skin pimples that never seem to go away
you need one pump to cover your whole face
maybe like 1/3-1/4 left i like to add a workable amount of ptr's unwrinkle serum to that bottle
this can leave your skin a bit dry
even sometimes it can be a bit drying to my sensitive yet mostly oily combination skin
those ingredients irritated my skin if i wasn't careful
doesn't dry out the skin at all
dry although i do feel like i have some oiliness on top of dry skin on my forehead
i also like that it doesn't bother my mild case of keratosis polaris
it says it has the tendency to dry out the skin
living in the midwest our weather can be brutal on the skin
doesn't dry me out but keeps my skin clear!
it isn't drying on my skin
it doesn't dry it out and it really works.
my skin is clearing like never before:
it does go on sticky, but dries instantly.
it can be drying
not drying like some products i have used
it never really did much to my blackheads as they're still visible
since you only need a small film layer
it'll go away the more your skin becomes used to it
my skin did seem a little less refined over time
maybe because i was in a very humid
it really stings my face, but its worth it.
i don't think it leaves a white film on my face
it's light enough so that its comfortable even on the hottest most humid day of summer
it's a strong exfoliant bringing all these blemishes that you would ordinarily have anyways to head quickly to treat them
i do not seem to have to worry about it drying my skin with use
to not have to hide my skin under all that foundation
i could tell that it was really pulling the impurities from my skin
there are still some very stubborn buggers that won't go away
so haven't had any irritation using this after washing
my skin used to get so oily during the day that if i touched my face i could literally wipe off all my makeup
does not feel greasy
blackheads do not seem so black anymore
not greasy at all
during the summer i have oily skin
during winters i will have dry patches
as soon as i wash my face it's super dry
after its dry my face doesn't feel dry nor oily
still takes care of any dry patches of skin
as i have oily skin already it does not make it worse
i love this moisturizer because it adds moisture without making skin feel or look oily
not heavy or greasy which is a huge plus
it gives moisture without a greasy or heavy feeling
smooth without ever becoming greasy during the day
it is surprisingly moisture rich for something so light
so far, it's enough moisture for the wintertime.
it seems to be just enough for my dry areas
not too much for my oily areas
have really struggled with dryness this winter
great for those who have oily skin.
gives his skin a moisturized feel without being heavy or causing break-outs
it doesn't leave any residue or shine.
it is usually totally free of any blemishes--
it is not oily at all
is like a quick drink to my skin
not greasy at all
some don't have enough moisture.
funny enough some actually dried out my skin
i get dry skin in my t-zone
the extra moisture goes where it needs to
it is perfect for use in my semi-oily t-zone
i love this moisturizer -- it's the only one that doesn't make my sensitive skin break out
i love the pump because i feel that the product stays sanitary as it is not in a jar
it not only helped my dry skin
it keeps my skin from drying out in the winter weather without it feeling oily
does not clog pores or casue break outs which is important with my amture
i simply use the wash
doesn't make my face feel like an oil slick
it is so lightweight that i was worried it wouldn't even provide any moisturize
my face didn't have any dry patches
just like the description says it's not at all sticky or oily feeling
my skin tends to be dry with a breakout once in a great while
does not leave greasy residue.
i can justify buying this moisturizer because at the end of the day my face doesn't end up looking like an oil-slick
right now i am using a different oil control moisturizer which is okay
not oily at all
the face wash is great it just really dries your skin out so paying $42 is worth it for me knowing that it will go a long way
my skin t-zone gets dry in the winter
it works for dry skin too
it looks shiny when you first put it on until it absorbs in your skin
love it because i tend to get oily skin
i would definitely recommend this product for someone with normal to oily skin
have always had a hard time finding a moisturizer that hydrates without making me look like a greaseball
other oil free moisturizers i've used after about 30 minutes it's like i haven't even put one on
i like to wear a non-greasy moisturizer with no spf on my face when i go to the gym so the spf doesn't run into my eyes when i sweat
it goes on light and is non-greasy.
does not make my face feel oily which i love
it make my skin so soft n oil free just like a matte finish
i feel like the moisture balance is finally back in my face
even though its oil free i don't feel like my face is dry at all
if you are prone to break outs.
it was non greasy
the only thing is that some people might not like the density of the cream since it's thicker than most moisturizers
it's especially good after cleansing or after you take off a mask
the only downside is parts of my face are drier than others so those parts can get cakey if i use only this
i kind of spot those areas with my regular drug store moisturizer to fix it
it gives enough hydration to the skin so you dont feel tight or dried up
i'd say my t-zone is half as oily
you can always put a very fine touch of oil free moisturizer where you need it
it is like sealing your face in perfection if you have perfect skin
keeps your t-zone oil in check
those of you who have oily
my face doesn't look oily at all
my skin looks worse without it.
i can't leave the house without wearing this hydrator
when you first put it on it feels a little greasy
once you give it a few minutes to absorb your skin feels smooth
every pore fixing matte claiming primer out there along with anthony logistics for men instant fix oil control which i had heard great things about
i don't get the oily shine until way at the end of my day
no break outs on this fair skin/sensitive gal.
it didn't leave a powdery/dry finish like the porefessional did
must try if you have oily skin
even in the humid summer weather it keeps my skin shine-free
it might be drying in winter weather
even worse when it's humid out.
have an oil slick by the time i make it to work
not too dry or powdery looking
seemed a bit drying but not too bad.
it gets a bit oily on the t-zone
the product does dry out very fast
it might not be that great for very dry or sensitive skin
for me it does feel dry after application
it hasn't actually dried my skin out at all
also because many products with vitamin c cause me to break out in little bumps
work quickly when you apply it because it dries super fast
if you use too much it just balls up
this is truly a must have for anyone with sun damaged skin
for my skin though, i found it very drying.
i been using this product for 12 days i love it i have a little tip if you can go to sauna or stem room
gently pat them together so all 8 fingers had product on them
my skin is less discolored from all the sun i got when i was younger
get compliments on my skin all the time
it didnt do anything in terms of removing the sun spots i have on my cheeks
take your stress down!!
i love how it soaks into my skin rather than sit on top like traditional mask i feel like it works better because it soaks in yes it's pricy
my skin isn't too oily or too dry
i still feel like this "balances" my skin out
doesn't leave any weird residual texture on your skin
instead of some other serums that leave your skin feeling the same afterward
i like to apply extra under eyes to give those lines an extra boost of moisture
nothing was working to get rid of the dryness
it is not oily at all
i struggle with a really oily t zone which i discovered is a result of my dry skin
it didn't irritate my skin or break me out
my skin is less dry in the summer
sensitive skin that will take any excuse to get irritated
it does seem to help control the oil a little bit
i totally recommend this for those who have dry skin especially this winter
it got me through the dry winter when my skin was flaking
considering the price i use this when i feel like my skin needs some extra hydration
this doesn't sting at all
you can feel it soak into your skin leaving it smooth
you really feel this product being soaked up into your skin
i find that in order to get better results to help with any dryness i use the caudalie vinosource intense moisture rescue cream before this serum
it has a really wet texture so your skin just drinks it up
i didn't think i'd get much use due to my oiliness
my makeup always ends up looking awful because my skin is so flaky
this is the one cream i've been able to use that doesn't leave my skin oily or cause any sort of reaction
in the winter months i get especially dry flaky patches
has worked miracles on my dry skin
not sticky but smooth.
my skin gets beyond dry in the winter
not stick or greasy
doesn't feel heavy or oily
i switch to washing my face with just water
your skin will drink this up
i tend to use a pump of this mixed with my regular moisturizer until it finishes
it is a little sticky at first
think this serum is fine enough to fill my pores rather than just sit on top
where your skin doesn't feel dry
around my nose more than usual that my moisturizer just couldn't seem to alleviate the issue
i get extremely dry
many would leave my skin with burning sensation
i wouldn't recommend it to anyone with oily to combo skin even though this product claims it to be an oil free serum
often get dry patches of skin during the winter
there is no greasy or sticky feeling
just one pump is enough to cover my face
i would definitely recommend it if your face is feeling dry this winter
you'd think the benefit of having super oily skin is that you never have to worry about dryness
my skin can become flakey in the winter time
everything seems to dry my skin or make it more irritated
it would be perfect for someone with oily skin because it absorbs very fast
i am noticing way more moisture in my skin
dry skin around my nose that nothing can help
i live in a very dry climate
no residue, no slick feeling and no shine.
however it can be dry
i didn't feel like it gave my skin any more benefit other than moisturization
doesn't make me look greasy throughout the day
seriously, if you have oily skin, you need this!
that was always dry
live in a very cold
it's very hard to find something that will help hydrate my skin without causing a breakout
i like that this doesn't make my t zone oily while it makes sure that my u zone stays out from dryness
for someone who has very dry
you know when your skin is dry
this really does quench your dry skin without sending it into a frenzy
oil not so oily feel
i like applying it fresh out of the shower
especially on days that are cooler
it can also be used in your hair
i like to mix it in with some vaseline when i apply it
this oil is one of the nicest things you can do for your skin after a shower
the bottle is glass though so be careful if you leave this is the bathroom
gives beautiful moisture anyhow
i can probably transfer the product into one of those pump containers or maybe a spray bottle ?
i don't like the spray pump- i wish i could pour the desired amount of oil i want to use instead of having to spritz
'm not sure if it makes combination skin more oily
this dry oil is amazing.
i usually wait till after my hair is dry before i add it
this oil is perfect for the ladies out there that suffer from severe flakiness
before then i was always skeptical of oil thinking that would stain my clothing or make me look greasy
i also use it pretty much all over my body when i want my skin to be soft
i really love this dry oil.
did not like it for my hair
it works best if used when skin is still damp
because you can use this oil anywhere that needs moisture
doesn't leave a greasy feel like some heavier oils
i can feel it absorb very quick
the first thing you experience when you open the bottle is the scent
not greasy at all
was pleasantly surprised by the way the oil absorbed into my skin without any greasy residue just soft
the oil is not in anyway greasy
a chance to dry out my skin with this oil
so much better than the nude oil.
a true lifesaver in the dry winter!
i don't typically like to put oil on my body
which is quite dry
best application is right after the shower when your skin is still damp
not too strong nor greasy
it is a dry oil
my skin does not get oily
no break outs or over oily skin.
this oil good for dry skin
it's quite expensive therefore i try to use other body oils
couldn't afford the argon oil so get this one instead
may be because i have thick hair
it doesn't have that smearing-feeling when you apply it
it generally lasts me through the dry winter
not too sure about oily skin.
this oil feels amazing on the skin--i like it best when i spray it on after the shower
it is not sticky at all you can apply it to your body or hair or even on your face witch is really h
i also enjoy using it on my body after a shower as it does not leave me feeling oily yet is very moisturizing
it's also the only oil i trust on my hair without making it overly greasy
some may prefer a drier oil, but i like this one.
the leftover oil on my face doesn't make me look shiny even though it feels great
it doesn't linger too long
works great over some of my lighter oils to seal them in
it leave your skin light
it doesn't make my face oily
and it does not look oily.
this oil is everything you look in a dry oil.
apply a little bit on your hair end to prevent freeze
it will accentuate the texture of your skin to the maximum degree if you apply too much to your face or body
you'll find your skin feeling very dry after you wash it off--- which indicates to me that it isn't that moisturizing
it also works the best right after a shower/bath while your skin is still damp
i want the devine scrub too.
it doesn't leave my skin greasy
divine oil also got rid of dry winter skin on my h
this oil is great for dry patches on the body
i'd imagine it would be a lovely bath oil as well
doesn't leave my face shiny or oily looking
also great as an overnight hair fix for split ends/dryness
i also use a tiny bit to smooth things out during the day if the frizz starts to return
even out my skin
it absolute into the skin like water it is not greasy
this stuff smells so good i want to eat my arms after applying
was a little skeptical about using oil as a moisturizer since i thought it would be greasy
it does wonders for my very dry skin
it saved my skin over this past cold dry winter.
i didn't like it used in my hair, felt heavy.
i always use this after i use rena levi's amazing scrub
or i use it more than once a week just on my cheeks as i think too much use might set off my zits/oil
do not pass this up if you have dry, red skin!
i would also use it as an overnight mask when i feel like i'm too lazy to wash it off
i live in a dry/cold climate
it gets very dry
by the looks of my skin you can tell that i am parched
i wonder if it will work well with the red clay cleanser ?
really great for dry, winter skin.
this winter might not ruin my skin after all.
if my skin is really acting up
i feel my normal moisturizers can go back to their jobs
my skin is dry even in the summer
you just have a bad skin day sometimes
if i ever overexfoliate or feel tight after cleansing
then i can go on with my regular routine without having to worry about new dry patches showing up
i like to keep it in the fridge so that it helps cool my skin as well
it doesn't dry on your face like other masks
i like to use this on days where my skin is flaky
once i wash it off
i will say that sometimes my skin starts to feel a bit warm
burn from contact with water all year long
when i get dry
patchy skin or my skin just needs a pick-me-up i use it
even the slightest change in weather can really mess me up
i always like the texture of my skin after i wash this mask off
even when it's dry it will melt off with warm water
i wouldn't say this is the most hydrating thing in the world
it doesn't make my oily parts worse
my skin did not feel tight or sticky after rinsing off
i will put a hot wash cloth on my face for a minute
my cheeks tend to get dry during the winter months
i typically have very dry skin
does not leave oily
don't have much experience with dry skin products
not oily or greasy at all
i feel like it helped even the oily areas of my face in calming
even if you have acne or irritated skin that isn't necessarily dry
as soon as i washed it off i could feel a difference
it didn't irritate it all which is important for my reactive
break my skin with so many itchy burning bumps which would have taken it much longer to heal
adds back the moisture that you might have lost due to the possible acids in your treatment
which get very dry
i love using this mask on days where my skin is feeling tight
i'll definitely keep this product in mind during the dry
i find that it keeps my skin from breaking out when it starts to feel dry
it helps take the redness out which makes them easy to cover up
which i found to be too greasy
is not greasy at all
my socal skin would suffer with the harsh winters
used this on my clean skin
i know product as moisturizing as this would probably wreak havoc on my t-zone
never makes my skin red or causes break outs
wanted to try a mask that doesn't dry my skin the minute i take it off
did not rip out any stray hairs that got in the way
i usually use this after my other clay masks that are a bit drying or after a microderm
it did not leave a residue
refreshing--i can see this would be wonderful for anyone with dry or irritated skin
in the winter it gets more dry
recommend this for dry skin.
this face mask is great for people with drier
doesnt irritate it at all
gets rid of any red patches that i may have on my face
i don't usually have dry skin
u did rinse it off after 10 mins though n my face did not feel tight
couldn't get it under control during these especially brutal winter temperatures
unlike most masks that make your skin tight
did i not put enough of the oatmeal mask on?
i found out it would make my skin dry after rinse it off though
although not perfect or completely healed
this is meant for people with dry skin.
this mask is so hydrating that when you take it off your skin gains life
thought i would try it to see if it would just calm the itchy feeling i had on my face
even when i don't have eczema i use this mask once a week because it leaves my skin so soft
i would recommend using a moisturizer meant for dry skin at night while you sleep so this doesn't dry out your skin
this will be just perfect if you have really oily skin or mostly oily skin like mine
it's so much less nd looks like a glow rather than a frying pan
i needed something to give me some moisture
i find i don't get shiny throughout the day
it mattifies so much it gives me dry patches
doesn't make my face look oily at all highly suggest
it controlled my oily skin so well that now i use it about once or twice a week under my primer
it control my oily face very well
i really recommend this for people with oily skin
you may want to try somethiing more like benefit's new porefessional mattifying fluid
easy to wash it off.
it hydrates my face just enough so that it isn't producing more oil to overcompensate for dry skin like with my other moisturizer
i also suffer from dry
good for oily type skin or combination.
i tend to have dry skin in the winter
most moisturizers tend to make me break out or just add to my oiliness during the day
night i've not had the oiliness i did have
it’s like a little drink for your skin.
probably best for oily skin folks
dry as a bone everywhere else
would always go for the really rich moisturizers which didn't help with my oily spots
it does work wonders on the oily areas of my face
i would recommend to anyone who has combination/oily skin to try this out
i get really oily on my tzone
did not have to blot the whole day!
i feel as though it's not always moisturizing enough for the rest of my face
not oily all day long
heavier lotions would make me break out or look oily before noon
i would consider my skin to be combination with an oily t-zone
it's also dry in places
t makes it a little bit expensive for a moisturizing that not have any anti-aging properties
it can be sticky
i wouldn't say that it absorbs quickly
i can feel dry in some places
doesn't leave my skin oily
nothing that some blotting papers or powder can't fix
doesn't peel or pill like some mattifying products do when you layer them over one another
this product does help with my oily skin
or feel like a super dry layer under make up
i don't feel dry either
it does hold back the oil by balancing out my skin
i still need to test it in much warmer weather
it takes away the oily shine which i have always had to deal with
that's when my skin became drier than usual
not a heavy feeling one would be better or you can incorporate a hydrating serum into the mix
during the winter my skin gets super dry
the only reason i am docking it 1 star is because it was not moisturizing enough for my face during the winter
i still have a few dry patches after i apply this
i still feel slightly dry when i put this over the moisturizer
i may have to use it for days i don't want to wear makeup because it's almost drying in a way
however because when my skin was very dry in some areas this did not quench its thirst for moisture what so ever
my oily skin is controlled for a good 8-10 hours without becoming overdry
the dryer parts of face are pleasantly moisturized without being overly so
they have left my skin really oily
this is the only moisturizer that can control the areas that are oily
i apply this cream on top of my face oil once it has absorbed
it is not greasy
they never fully moisture my dry sometimes flakey skin
you can visibly see it has moisturized your skin because there aren't any rough patches or dryness compared to the many other moisturizers i've tried
this is an absolute must for those with dry flakey skin
just know that it is not for oily or combination skin types
it'll make you too oily
the rest of my face hurts in the winter because it gets so dry
if u have dry skin
although it helped with the dry flaky skin i was getting i did notice the texture was a little too much for regular use
i needed a cream light enough that my skin can breath
i do not have flakey or ashy skin anywhere
my face is no longer dry
you wouldn't believe how many products i've tried that were supposed to moisturize my skin
it doesn't come out too sticky
now i know i just have super dry, sensitive skin.
it is not greasy.
love that is does not have any nasty chemicals.
doesn't just sit on the surface of my skin
usually stay away from creams like this
greasy or make me super oily in the am
i went into sephora after trying many moisturizers for winter dryness some of which came with hefty price tags
it did however make my skin hot
it seems to not sink in my face
or dry all the way
recommend it as treatment for really dry skin
doesn't make my skin break out
come to find out my skin is naturally dry
my poor skin was producing excess oil to make up for the dryness
are you super dry?
i get very dry skin in the winter.
so glad i finally found something that works for my dry flakey skin
red bumps that form when i don't use enough moisturizer
if i don't have my vinosource moisture rescue cream
it is not oily
it is too heavy for my entire face
not the type to soak in immediately which is what i like
if you want a light weight moisturizer or have very oily skin this is probably not for you
all of my dry patches are totally gone
no more dry patches for me!
works so well on my girls dry skin.
i could no longer use it immediately before i applied my makeup as it was too greasy
hopefully it won't continue to be greasy
wanted something natural that would put the moisture back in without being oily
two days ago my skin was going crazy from being dry because of the cooler weather
only thing is i was expecting the same application as the sorbet
it does not leave you oily or greasy
you don't need more than a pea size of the lotion for your whole faace
on occasions that i need extra coverage this provides enough moisture to prevent any concealers/treatments from cracking
i did not the day i used this because it does appear to have orange pigment in it
i would consider this to be more "maintenance": i apply it right after i wash my face/get out of the shower with my moisturizer
she also tends to have violent reactions to any product that her skin doesn't like
it wasn't a cream treatment as you would expect from clinique
it's supposed to make under eye skin thicker
it definitely works well as an under eye primer without drying up my skin
has a nice feel to it as you apply it with a special applicator
plus i feel like i have to rub it in a long time.
i find myself applying less cover up which means my makeup is less cakey
my skin is not dry at all
even the matching seaberry cleansing oil is amazing if you're too scared to run oil on your face like i was
i found it works best to warm it up in your h
this says that it's for dry skin
this oil works great on my dry areas
i also find this oil is amazing for my hair.
looks a lot less greasier than other oils i've tried like the ufo
although i have oily skin
i never thought i'd find something to reduce my oiliness
i stopped using it as summer is coming so my skin isn't as dry as it usually is in the winter
even in very cold
i find that it's too oily for the warm weather
too oily in the t-zone
i decided to try this because i have oily skin
just not enough moisture for my dry skin in the winter
dry patches which is nice
i could never find that happy medium to get moisture
how fast it obsorbs into my skin
its not one of this weird oils that just sits on top of your skin
doesn't make you look oily or greasy
hasn't caused my oily skin to freak out
it was a little oily
it does not leave my skin oily at all
it really do keep your face moist!
without looking like an oil slick
my skin is oily during the day
it got rid of all my dry spots
couldn't believe how dry my skin was
my skin doesn't feel dry anymore at all.
this oil has really made my skin look amazing without getting my pores clogged
and it doesn't leave a residue on my skin.
you really can't smell it unless you put the open bottle up to your nose
last winter was the first one that i did not have flaky skin on my forehead
it does a wonderful job at providing moisture without being greasy
especially because i sometimes use very drying deep cleansing regiments to clean out the t-zone
it might be better if you're not mixing it with moisturizer
can become "greasy/oily" looking quickly if too much is used
i can't even pick a favourite face oil
winter time is the worst and my skin goes nuts.
has anyone else actually used this on burns?
it is the only facial oil that doesn't cause me to break out
this is a game changer coming from someone with oily to dry skin
i noticed that my face doesnt peel anymore.
i face usually peel every week
i noticed my moisturizers in the pm just weren't cutting it to make me feel nourished
not oily, not dry, but normal and perfect!
whenever i forget to bring it with me i feel mu skin tight
needing more moisture for my dry areas without breaking out the oily areas of my face is a hard combination
clean with just the right amount of oil
because of this when i use spot treatments i would get dry patches
once the beginning of november hit my skin was so dry i knew i needed to add some extra moisture to my routine
it did help with texture: my skin is no longer super oily or super dry
any more will make you pretty greasy
this oil somehow makes it less oily
although i look like such a grease ball when i go to bed
i never thought that an oil would work wonders on my very oily skin
doesn't break out my combination skin.
love this face oil!
it always hydrates my skin without overdoing it or making me break out
love this face oil.
n combination to your favorite foundation if your skin is feeling a little dry
it says at the top only good for normal or dry skin
then my moisturizer with the spf in it as well or just two drops of this if i'm not going into the sun
it does not make my face feel oily.
not greasy at all
which is typical for me to have it on my nose
it'll help prevent future dry patches
when i think oil i think of greasy
it doesn't provide the hydration-this is a tad bit thicker
when i rub it in
i love any moisture an oil or cream can provide however i need it to sink in
i sometimes apply this to my lips before i go to bed because my lips were super dry
well this oil really does revive that soft baby-like skin
it controlled my oily skin so well throughout the day
i decided to buy this oil because of all the good nutrients it had in it
although my skin may look a little oily
dont be scared away from oil if you gave oily skin
it is a quite heavy oil
it doesn't make my skin fell too oily
so creating a mixture of it with the other 2 oils really helps it go all over my skin easily
other oils tend to be too greasy
i've used a few other drugstore face oils that i could only use at night because they left my face slick
i wanted one i could wear under my moisturizer during the day since my face is becoming drier as i get older
need an oil that won't cause break outs
i mix 2 to 3 drops with belif cream moisture bomb *as she does* every night to seal in all the goodies i've put on my face
any other time i feel dry
maybe the people that did break out were also allergic to grapeseed oil
does not make my combo skin greasy.
it doesn't leave your skin dry
it has a great bottle dropper so you aren't dipping dirty fingers to apply
weren't super super dark they were acne scars from when i didn't stop picking at something i shouldn't have
s is not as effective because the serum needs to be rubbed below the skin's surface
this serum has lightened them up more then anything else i've tried
it is drying though.
i can only use it 1x a day or else my skin gets dried out
doesn't make me break out unlike many other serums
i don't have any dark sports or pigmentation so can't speak in that area
doesn't leave your face dry or tight
you don't need to use too much to get a good amount of moisture
also, does not make me oily at all.
i need something for my dull skin
since this can be drying
this was amazing but only if i slathered it on.
the regular crummy kind you can muck with trying eye creams that promise youth in 28 days or pay cash for plastic surgery
try not to use in the daytime unless you have a very strong spf day cream
i did not find it too drying or irritating
which is oily in summer
i bet most of the people do not realize that even a brief exposure to sun will vamp up melanin production
does not dry out my skin.
it also doesn't burn or sting
at first i used it applying it with my finger afraid to waste product with pads
this solution has definitely made my skin look like i've had a peel
or make it dry
it can be drying
so make sure you use moisture
space to every other day if you get too dry
it is not harsh or drying at all.
the only results i really ever got was dry skin
not only did it work insanely fast at getting rid of my acne
knowing i cans still look good without makeup
i expect that if a person had oily skin
neither was helping to control my oily skin
i didn't have to blot or powder my face all day!
my pores are huge making me a bit acne-prone so this product did the trick
it also doesn't dry my skin out
all 3 products together didn't dry out my face
this mask is so amazing for oily
the oily "i" zone i call mine is so hard to control
i think that might be quite drying
so over the summer my skin tends to get extra greasy/oily
if you use a small amount as a primer it will keep your t zone shine free all day
as it can be a bit over-drying
i would only recommend using this as a mask if you suffer from oily skin
it has been keeping my oily
has not dried my skin at all
you can even use a tiny bit as a primer for days you really need your makeup to last if you have very oily skin
i would avoid using it as a primer if your skin isn't very oily though
it makes your skin look extremely dry with the white flakes it creates if overused
am always in search of a product that can both treat my acne while not drying out my skin
when i see a pimple coming it i wash my face as usual
the best part of this mask which forced me to write a review is that the other day when i used tarte's new hydrating cream on my face i woke up with a lot of tiny breakouts
i didn't realize that an oil could be non-greasy
don't limit yourself to using this as an overnight mask
with just a week of using it as an overnight treatment on problem areas my skin is clearing up so wonderfully
ditched my primer i believe it was causing breakouts on my cheeks anyhow
i even got a sample of the green liquid stuff to try
i usually have very dry skin
it dries pretty quickly with a thin layer so you can go to sleep pretty immediately after putting it on
it does not really dry so you may wake up with some of it under your fingertips
it really does work especially when salicylic acid doesn't work for mature acne
it warms on contact but it's not really a mask?
dennis gross suggested i wear this underneath my make up to help with my oil throughout the day
i switched to my other mattifying primer because i felt
the reason i had to replenish my ptr sulfur mask was because it easily dried out even though i stored in a cool dry place with the cap tight
usually when my diet goes off track
it doesn't dry out too drastically
i don't know what it is --- i have used many sulfur masks
which means it doesn't entirely stink or dry out the skin
where i get the most oily
i've tried a lot of products that overly dry out my face
not dry out my skin
moisturize afterward or you can be left with like a white residue
doesn't dry me out either!!
i can’t use these without my skin going red
it is very cold
my skin is usually so dry in spots this time of year
/or bring the blemish to a head so that it can dry out
i didn't find it drying
first i have dry sensitive sink
if you do have dry skin
use it i suggest getting a good moisturizer to counter the little drones that occurs
i no longer have to worry about my face getting oily during the day
i love that it's kind of a 3 in 1 product: you can apply a thick layer
one small dab is really all you need
what i usually get with fast-acting drying products
not so good for dry
is great for dry skin in the winter
if you use only a little bit on a pimple
i prefer sulfur based products over others because it doesn't burn or irritate the skin
t seems to dry up
you'll get treatment all day :
have you got those deep blemishes that just don't want to come to the surface or go away?
one or two treatments overnight is all it takes to clear up before it creates a mess on my skin
underneath your makeup as a primer is worth it if you have a backlog of stuff on your face
you really only need half a pump to moisturize your whole face effectively
i don't mind using it as a spot treatment or mask
it would always dry out halfway through the tub
it doesn't over dry my skin
it can be a little drying sometimes though
normal to maybe oily skin
you really only need a small dab!
i admit that i thought that would be enough moisture come winter
mix in a bit of the moisture bound crème i still have from my sample
other days i want to add this silky
i want the face wash too
it's not super moisture feeling on my face
i am so dry that i can drench my skin in moisture
i don't think i've ever come across anything this velvety soft in my life
i will have to find something additional to add as i do dehydrate very quickly
as someone with oily
this gets 5 stars for not burning my skin
if you buy a moisturizer for its smell you will be disappointed because amore pacific is about results
low for some kind of skin care line that would help repair the appearance of my skin
i live in a very dry climate
as soon as you put it on your skin it instantly feels calm
does not feel heavy or greasy
my wallet empty as i reapply cream all day long
i tend to break out a lot on my chin so this was recommended by the rep of amore
because i only use it on my dry areas
not abrasive its a must try
also after i've used one of my more intense face masks because it calms my skin much better than my everyday moisturizer
doesn't leave any greasy residue
it can be overly greasy if you apply too much
doesn't make the oily parts worse
it can be overly greasy if you apply too much
it can be overly greasy if you apply too much
it can be overly greasy if you apply too much
it can be overly greasy if you apply too much
it can be overly greasy if you apply too much
it can be overly greasy if you apply too much
it can be overly greasy if you apply too much
it can be overly greasy if you apply too much
it can be overly greasy if you apply too much
it can be overly greasy if you apply too much
it can be overly greasy if you apply too much
it can be overly greasy if you apply too much
it can be overly greasy if you apply too much
it can be overly greasy if you apply too much
it can be overly greasy if you apply too much
it can be overly greasy if you apply too much
it can be overly greasy if you apply too much
it can be overly greasy if you apply too much
it can be overly greasy if you apply too much
it can be overly greasy if you apply too much
it can be overly greasy if you apply too much
it can be overly greasy if you apply too much
it can be overly greasy if you apply too much
this product really is not for oily or combination skin
not just sit as a layer on top of your skin
i'd say spurge if you have dry skin
don't waste your money if you are oily
this product is thick but it doesn't feel greasy.
this product is soothing without being anything
nothing would make my dry
it is not oily at all
which you can use around your eyes as well thus dumping your eye cream
i think my skin hasn't been as oily as it usually is
this cream does so much!
this stuff doesn't irritate my skin
you get used it after awhile or force yourself to ignore the smell since the product is so wonderfully moisturizing
my skin gets dry in the winter
is not sticky or greasy
all the other products i have tried have dried out my combo skin
heavy cream that doesn't feel heavy on
-absorbs quickly which means you can go to bed immediately after use-i love the smell
or burn at all
especially in the cold
i don't apply it on my forehead since serums can give me white heads
my own fault because i always thought sun damage was just when your face burns throughout the years- not easier for people that don't burn :-/
i hate having to put on powder everyday.
... well, my skin, anyway ..
this tends to work but really dries out my skin.
i hate when serums are way too thick
helps with my skin which tends to break out
it tends to run thru my fingers before i can evenly apply it
is not goopy under my make up
i don't use it every day especially since my skin is sensitive
i do agree that it is difficult to hold a thin oil layer in our h
however my skin tends to react/break out easily
if you pump it normally
it is like a kiss on your face all day.
love this product since it absorbs so quickly too
most products leave my skin feeling greasy or weighed down or make me break out or get some sort of irritation
it does feel like it is a little drying to my skin
i am not blotting excessively like usual
allows me to apply another serum directly over it without having to wait for it to dry
because i find it makes my skin less oily
this is the only one that didn't leave a sticky residue
my problem is the product is so thin that you lose a little down the bottle with every oump
no too heavy or oily.
burn this one however doesn't
give it a try if you have a bit of puffy
i always feel the need to go for more watery type of eye creams
which i feel gets evaporated anyways
because if i use too much it tends to seep into my eyes
really does instantly brighten as well as lighten over time
did not irritate my skin.
the area under my eyes does get dry
using too much can leave a cakey appearance.
because i was sure it said to also apply on the eyelids
sucks that you can't get it near your eyelids
i found this cream if i put too much on makes my skin burn
puffiness so decided to give it a try thinking that if it makes it bright then the puffiness will not show as much
just a dab is all you need
going into winter i also wanted to find an eye cream that provided plenty of moisture
this is good for me because i don't like to wear make up other than occasional mascara
try not to rub too much when applying make up
at night i put extra amount to the point of greasiness
i try every new eye cream or treatment that comes out
i usually don't believe any products that claim to get rid or smooth under-eye dark circles
my skin was going through a dry spell
if you push down on the pump slightly too hard it's easy to waste a lot of product
it doesn't make my t-zone oily
its not a heavy cream apt for winter months.
it doesn't irritate my skin or make my more oily.
normally when i break out the acne is dried out in a day or two
i got this because i had just been prescribed a daily cream for my acne that made my normally slightly dry skin even worse
it's gentle enough that it doesn't irritate my face while still keeping it from drying out
doesnt leave any sort of residue
i live in a very dry climate
doesn't make your skin feel sticky
never greasy or oily
might work better on someone with slightly less dry skin than mine
it didn't irritate my face
i think this would work for combo to oil as well as combo to dry
i can react to products especially when my skin is dry
this did not irritate my skin at all
this moisturizer does not break me out or make my acne worse whatsover
do still see some dry patches
it's the only thing that holds up against my extremely dry skin
it is light and not greasy at all.
it mositurizes my skin without leaving it oily or irritated
oil free that wouldn't cause me to break out
you may have to reapply several times throughout the day or purchase a thicker cream
i know that is bad for your hair
made the dry patches go away
i don't usually put anything on my face anymore in the daytime since every product that i have used causes me to either sweat or sweat more
well not using a moisturizer has left me with problem dry areas on my cheeks
combination normal/oily skin that isn't too rich
i felt like it didn't do enough to really moisturize my skin during the winter
even out my skin
i don't feel greasy or like i have a ton of product on after i apply
when i moved back to san diego where the weather isn't as extreme the moisturizer was too heavy for me
it gives just enough moisture without being too heavy or greasy
i can't see myself using any other moisturizer during fall/winter time
this is great to use when my skin is normal or oily
have to mix in a facial oil with this in order to get the moisture i need
doesn't cause my sensitive skin to break out
this one gets absorbed into my skin without that greasy feel
doesn't weigh down my skin
not greasy in the least
n winter because otherwise they can make your face a bit oily
my makeup goes on nicer and no more dry spots.
i am dry in some places and have an oily t-zone.
it does not irritate my skin
provides just the right amount of moisture without being too heavy
it helped the dry patches on my skin that was peeling off a little during harsh toronto winter
too thick as soon as it started to be warmer outside though
because my face because very dry
i switched from origin's "nitamins" cream because it felt too heavy/oily for me
i do not find that this hydrates too much
it is completely changing my dry
i generally apply it a couple times to my very dry spots
i would not say it heals my dry skin when i get dry skin
flakey skin i was trying to get rid of when the weather started to cool down
the skin on my face gets dry
especially those with lots of scent or those that are oily
doesn't every feel heavy or thick on your face
even oily or slightly dry
who does not need this moisture
i find that i only use it at night because it tends to leave my skin a bit greasy/tacky for hours
i love the way may skin looks when using it in combination with the camu camu serum
they need to put this in a see-through container or make it a screw on jar
not feel oily like other products i used
does not make skin shiny or oily
with an oily yet somehow always dry t-zone
the push down function to retrieve the lotion actually helps keep your portion to the right amount without wasting which i love
doesnt feel greasy once applied.
some reviews say that this stuff makes your face greasy-this moisturizer isn't for oily skin
they are either too greasy or not enough moisture at all
i do get dry during the winter
it is a perfect balance of moisture with out being too heavy
it burns pretty bad
my skin doesn't feel dry in the morning
makes my skin feel great totally addicted to the product line would recommend it to anyone seeking moisture without the greasy side effects
i decided to try this cream because i used to have pretty oily skin
after using ptr my skin has been quite dry
also great for the colder and drier months.
theres always a few more days worth of cream inside
get more out when your h
s are already wet from rubbing some on your face
that's always been the case with my skin no matter what i use to moisturize
i usually do not like using moisturizers because they tend to make my face oily
i tend to have dry
now that my face an neck are so happy to be moisturized i only use at night to give my skin the best drink ever
it makes my face quite oily during the day
i am not using the toner that goes with it as i found it to be too harsh
to get my make-up to look pore-less
though my skin is not really oily anymore
i only use this product on my nose
if you are worried about large pores this product works
if you just use this pore treatment without the pore minimizer you get the same benefits for less money
most products that i want to use for my oily skin
make me more oily
i like what it did to my pores on my nose too
i can tell my pores are getting smaller
like many others my pores seem to be larger than those who have more dryer skin
it has been a extremely humid summer so even though i take extra good care of my skin i could really notice the pores on my nose
my oily skin is a a mess this year
i've had to discontinue most of my normal skin care products other than eye because they are clogging my pores
i never felt any "burning"
i gave 4 stars instead of 5 because it does have a pretty intense burning sensation when you first apply it
it does burn while it's drying
not a terrible burn or anything just enough to feel slightly uncomfortable
man do my breakouts shrink when i use this
theexfokiation as you rinse it off is nice as well
my skin doesn't feel oily after using this product
my face got irritated if i used it too often :
this stuff burns like all get out
it does "burn" a bit, but it is worth it.
for first 2 mins it hurts like you've hot sauce on your face
not as good as this one i think because what i need the most is something to exfoliate my skin
my skin looked significantly better after washing it off
not as much as when i used a thick layer
the majority of the time i'm gonna use this mask as directed with a thin layer
didnt irritate me at all
especially when i feel like really clogged or my skins overly not pure looking
when i did wash it off
hot water can have the same effect on my super dry skin
after using this mask the first thing i thought was how dewy
because otherwise you'll end up with dead skin blocking your moisturizer from soaking in
this mask leaves my skin so soft for the next 1-2 days after use
it is tingly when you put it on
my face is combo with some very oily patches
irritation after washing off even though my skin is never sensitive
afterwards my skin looks more like it's had some kind of chemical peel done
as it's hard to think about emotional distress when it feels like your cheeks are melting off
get a sample first if you're worried about the discomfort
some of the reviews said the tingle/burn can be really intense on certain skin types
if other people with normal skin says it burns
the tingling was a strong minty kind of feel- sort of like how your mouth would feel when using listerine
as a person who has to deal with dry skin
i love using this when my skin feels clogged.
the product dries out if you don't use it up quickly
'm not sure how good this is for sensitive or dry skin
if you're looking to get your first facial mask
especially if i notice any burning or tingling
because of some reviews i read of a burning feeling while putting the mask on
can afford buying the big jar of the youth mud
one it dried it didn't burn anymore
as it dries you feel the typical tightening feeling
didn't burn my face for me
cannot stress the "thin" part enough
when you remove it you can feel that your skin is smoother
much needed in the winter when your skin is getting drier
keep in mind that i have combo oily skin
i love harsh exfoliators because i feel the dead skin going away
i wouldn't recommend to dry skin because i have more oily skin
not too often because it can dry out skin
it's not for overly sensitive or damaged skin so don't try it if you're in that bucket
washing it off was easy.
when you first apply the product it isn't so much of a tingle as it is a burn
i love to indulge in thirsty mud immediately after as it dries you out
did not dry it out
if you tend to have dryer or sensitive skin
because while it is drying
apply the mask well my face is a bit damp is it makes it easier to spread on your face
i seem to get a couple extra uses out of each jar
anything with clay or charcoal in it usually sets my face on fire
have to remove it asap because my face feels like it has a flamethrower on it
this one contains 'french sea clay' which didn't irritate my skin whatsoever
even in the shower were a bit difficult to completely remove
get very little sleep
although it did not get rid of my dark circles
that a lot of people didn't read the instructions on how to wipe some of the serum on the lip of the bottle before application
if you need to de-puff then this is your safe haven
the dark circles reduced so much that i don't need concealer to cover them up anymore
it's definitely effective in getting rid of most of my puffiness with its cool touch
now i enjoy using the cool tool all around the eye as a little mini massage
when you avoid using your fingers
i think it keeps you from over-rubbing the sensitive skin under your eyes
it is a bit thick so you got to get used to how the applicator works
a little heavy if used much
ignore all the reviews that say about it drying out your skin
the applicator does make you use too much
you must follow up with an eye cream for the moisture
i recommend putting a little bit of eye cream after if you have dry eye area
i find myself either tapping the want to get some of the serum off or dabbing it on my face
this product lasted all day on my skin without a greasy feeling
not greasy at all
does not linger on your skin
absorbs so quickly i don't even need to wash my h
i do find that i need to use an exfoliating face wash more often than before
it took much longer to "soak in" to my skin than when i used the instructed amount
it doesn't feel heavy or greasy at all
i still wake up with dry skin
feel hot from it being too thick
it does make my face a tad more shiny than i would like for a daytime look
one tip--you'll want to make sure that you are exfoliating once/twice a week
considering the horrid 90-100 degree dry heat that we have been having where i live
i do find this crème to be a bit too heavy for hot
it did rub on and disappear.
not over powering which i like especially since my allergies can be bothered by certain scents
to even out my 45+ sometimes sensitive
mixing up my skin care routine to get the look
the dry down can get sticky
it does help if you either tone or exfoliate your skin regularly because when i don’t
not greasy or heavy at all
it doesn't give your skin a sticky feeling
i love how it just sinks into my skin
not greasy or sticky feeling at all
my skin absorbed the moisturizer quickly which is good because no one wants an oily face during a hot / humid summer in new york city
it did take awhile for it to absorb because it is thicker
rna would be better for drier skin
my acne marks heal more quickly-or just get lighter which ever way it's a win-win
did not cause breakouts although my skin didn't have any hidden gunk in it
it's most likely because your skin is pushing all the gunk out of your pores
it does not leave my skin oily
any product that leaves my skin feeling sticky or wet
someone would inevitably tell me that my skin looked glowy or dewy
t's better for normal/combination skin or dry skin in the summer
if you overwork it into the skin it does begin to flake off
you do not feel that heavy feeling that you get with some moisturizers especially ones that are anti-aging
my face never got oily
this product does leave me looking like i have a little sheen on my face
doesn't leave it greasy
you really do only need the smallest of pumps to cover your face so although pricey
once it's worked in to your skin
the only down side is on humid days it felt a little sticky on my face for about 30 mins or so
it is by far the best hydrating beauty product i have used that doesn't seen heavy when applied
you only need one pump to spread over your face
my face is neither oily nor sticky after using one pump
the only downside is on hot humid days
goes on without feeling heavy or oily
i love that it doesn't make my skin more oily
you can see your skin getting firmer.
and i get compliments on my skin all the time.
obviously has never heard of emulsion
it doesn't leave any irritation
also gets really dry in some parts
i let it dry for a few mins then put on primer/makeup
or so tag for clear stuff in a bottle
it's not drying at all
i may still repurchase it because i like my pores stay clean
without leaving smoky 'raccoon eyes' behind like my other cleansers do
this cleanser works wonderfully whether you have perfectly balanced skin or if you are in the middle of the worst inflammatory process ever
it a bit pricey for a face wash
the product foams up so a little goes a long way.
does not leave any residue
if you struggle with dry skin
when i rinse i often use a warm washcloth to make sure i'm getting rid of all the dirt
without any oil or product residue at all
it has really helped with my skin in the summer that is prone to more breakouts with the extra product i wear
more so than using a face wash.
i like how the consistency changes when you rinse with water instead of staying an oily consistency
not greasy like i expected
if you are searching for an oil based cleanser that not only will clean your face
i add warm water to my face
i put a little bit of water all over my face
none of the other oils that i've used made my face this smooth
it wont leave your face oily?
needless to say i will be only purchasing this cleansing oil to clean my face
it hasn't clogged that up like coconut oil used to whatsoever
my skin doesn't feel dried out after like it normally does after washing
be sure to stay away from your hair line
now that i have this cleansing oil it's a one step process to clean it all off
add a bit of water for a little bit of foaming action
once i dry off
my t-zone is very oily whereas the rest of the face is very dry
had a feeling that my skin may break out if i use the oil
apply oil to my already very oily skin.
i expected my oily
i would be left an oily mess
this product is almost like a dry oil
perhaps in the winter i could use it more often because my facial skin is less drier in those months
was a little worried when i saw that it is for oily to combination skin as i tend to have dry skin
the directions say to use on dry skin
it's very difficult to find a cleanser that is strong enough for the oilier areas of my face yet gentle enough for the drier areas
just 2 pumps of the oil is enough to clean my face
so using an oil-based cleanser has always scared me a bit
do note that you need to apply it to dry skin
those are just little things that don't detract from the fact that this is great facial cleanser
s made my skin break out or become super dry
i loved that i just had to massage it onto my dry skin
you only need to use 1 pump to clean your entire face
not thick or greasy like my old brand.
it also doesn't make your skin feel dry
though oily, it did not seem thick.
it is not greasy or oily at all.
silky its absorb into the skin so quickly its incredible feeling after used i know sound like im too crazy for this stuff
the only thing i am not sure about this oil is its "oily" feel
i cannot tell when i can stop rinsing
the consistency is just right without being too watery or thick
for those who feel like it leaves a layer of oily film afterwards
i suppose to allow the cleansing oil to loosen up the dirt
it does blur your vision for a minute until you can wash it off so contact wearers
or not thick enough
i simply wet my face
something very important to me since my face is exposed to extreme cold
you barely need 2 pumps to get your face clean so while it may be expensive
i've found it's best to follow up with a normal cleanser to really make sure your face is squeaky clean
how it doesn't strip all the oils out of my face
my face didn't feel greasy after applying the cream
just a dab will do you!
just use the pearl sized amount you will supply your face with just enough moisture to not be too greasy
it can tend to be greasy if you apply too much.
if you like rich texture creams this is a nice pick for you
i think this is better suited for cooler climates then in the midwest heat
have had to stop because of the summer heat was making my skin feel too greasy
this product got rid of my dry skin completely.
if you just need light moisture
you may not enjoy the drenching this cream does to your skin
if it's slightly dry to combo or oily
the serum is easy to get out of the pump
the serum is very slippery when initially put on my face
it doesn't irritate my skin at all
it isn't necessary to have a heavier cream
if you use a smaller amount on a wet face it becomes easier to ware
otherwise when i did my makeup immediately after applying the cream i looked way too dewy
think if you have dry skin
/or like a dewy look this cream could be for you
i did not feel like lotion was dripping into my eyes
you don't need to be heavy with using the cream you only need a little dab
have a hard time finding a moisturizer that doesn't leave my t zone overly oily
i really like the container it is in
the included spatula is very helpful in taking out the perfect amount to put on your skin
t is a very dry desert climate
your skin still dries out living here
the not so good: i wish it contained spf.
typically i end up losing the spatula because there's no where to put it
i would scream if i caught anyone wasting this pricy stuff on the palms of their h
only bad thing about this cream is that its a little heavy to use in the summer with sunscreen
this cream will for sure be a lifesaver in winter when my combo skin is at its worst
it was too much moisture for me
i normally have normal to dry
the skin around my nose that likes to peel all the time because my skin is so dry
not put any on my face to see if my new amazing skin texture would last
then this might be your holy grail
so taking to much of this cream makes my skin extra oily
it is not to oily
the product sit on my skin
it really does have lasting moisture too!
it feels like i'm washing off last night's cream
trying to find a good cream for my combination oily/dry skin
it comes with a little scooper so you don't have to use you fingers to take some cream out of the jar
could leave your face looking greasy or oily
my face has been so dry
every so often i will get a blemish
does not feel like typical serum
does not leave skin greasy at all
once it's dried you won't feel sticky on the face
wait until it is completely dry before you apply your moisturizer
the very first time i used it my face felt sticky
that seems to help it soak in faster
it seems a little sticky at first
it is a little bit tacky after applying so make sure if you're going to use it you give it an appropriate amount of dry down time before applying makeup
it's like a drink of water for your skin.
as switching anything in my skin care routine tends to break me out for weeks
my skin is normally dry on its own
it is like looking at myself through a good filter except i don't need the filter
think of all the money you waste of products to hide imperfections
it did not make my face feel greasy or slick
now i can feel fine going out on everyday runs with just my ud de-slick compact that i only apply mid-day or later
it does not leave a residue
cause my face it's really dry
does not make my sensitive skin break out.
i only use it on my lids though
sometimes when i find another eye cream that works wonders under my eye i try it on my lids
it sinks in quickly so you can put your eye makeup on without worrying about smudges
not thick or heavy or greasy
my make up doesn't cake up or crease anymore.
i really like how easily this cream is absorbed.
doesn't irritate my eyes either.
it's thick enough that you only have to use a dab
i can feel my eye area tightening when i apply this cream
it didnt sting or burn at all for me
the only reason i'm not giving it five stars is because it was just the tiniest bit too oily for my skin
just enough that i had to be a little more vigilant with my acne-fighting cleansing/face masks/etc
the pump doesn't come close to cleaning out the container
it will be chilled when you apply it
it's also getting rid of her under eye fat bags.
not oily or greasy just enough.
while this mask is on i can see it sucking out oil
this is where the dirt
i would also recommend using this every other day as opposed to everyday to give your skin a break from the acidity
warning: depending on your skin type it can hurt a little
this worked better for me than pore strips as they are not able to pull many blackheads out of my skin
keep in mind ones skin gets worse before it gets better
the mask does burn a bit
worried to use on dry
it does burn a little at first
when i apply it it stings a bit
using this to spot treat dried it up fast
whats great about it is that you can use it as a spot treatment to remove stubborn white heads
love it for a good cleaning on my problem area which is my nose
honey let me tell you about my clogged pores
i love how you can literally see it cleaning out your pores my husb
don't use this after exfoliating it'll burn like crazy
only glamglow mask that doesn't contain an ingredient to break me out
you can literally see it working it draws out all the oil in pores
i literally have never found a mask that didn't make me break out or more oily
basically gave myself a chemical peel without really wanting one
with this mask i have been able to get my skin smooth
when it starts to dry you can't move your face
it's almost like i can feel my pores opening up
it definitely stings a bit when drying
it dries so you know when to wash it off
you can also see the areas where it's sinking into your pores as it's drying
the mask does burn a bit the first few minutes it's on
it seems like most cleaning mask do that
i know it's this because i have tried everything under the sun for my acne
you have to wash your face after you use this mask
i can see it pulling oil out of my pores which look smaller when i am done
it really stings/burn your face for a few seconds
not only do you see immediate results after rinsing off the mask
it is hard to wash off
i can see it absorbing any excess oil
we both have fairly dry skin
almost like you got a sun burn on your face
im assuming from having dry skin
it definitely reduces/eliminates any acne i have even if it's somewhat below the very surface of my skin
it felt like a burn
i apply it all over my skin
it also left my skin with a matte finish rather than oily
i also actually really love that it isn't a peel off mask because that stress on your skin messes with your elasticity over time
i find that i get the best results when i let it harden onto my skin
i am diligent enough with my make up / skincare that i don't break out too often
i just use a thin layer as a spot treatment over anywhere i'm breaking out
i love that it helps control my oily skin
i honestly have no words for how soft my skin felt after washing this mask off
after you apply it on your nose
it also doesn't dry out my skin if i use it more than once a week
the pores on my nose have been so deeply congested that even my esthetician couldn't get them out
if not i'll definitely continue using it just to clean out my pores
it does calm my skin down a lot
just make sure you moisturize after because it can dry out your skin
nothing clears my skin like this
don't over expose to the sun either
feel if you have dry or sensitive skin this will make your face red/irritated
if your pores are small or your skin is dry this may sting a little
doesn't irritate my skin whatsoever
it really does pull out the gunk living in your skin
i would still get oily mid day
i can feel the tingling as the product goes to work
my skin feels like it can breathe once i've used this
the moisturizer is thick which made me wonder if it would be heavy
there is this dry skin one
both have very thick texture however they sink in completely
absolutely no oil or grease left
it keeps the oil production in my t zone in check for much longer than any other mattifying products i have used because it deals with the root cause of excessive oiliness--dehydrated skin
i found it very suiting for my summer skin that tends to get oily with dry patches
minus one star because it may not be hydrating enough during the winter
fortunately you don't have to use a lot to hydrate skin
it doesn't leave me that greasy
it's light enough in the humid new engl
summer that i don't get super oily
i totally recommend trying that if the treatment alone doesn't keep your skin from drying out
my skin is combination/very oily around my t-zone
my only issue is that it isn't super hydrating on my dry spots
it's been the only thing that magically works while i sleep to truly hydrate
though it sometimes feels a little drying
i sometimes need two coats for super dry
so the jar will last you
tent to get really dry skin during winter so
at night it is gentle enough to put on my eyes as we'll
this has never given me an oil slick
f you have oily skin like me
don't want your makeup getting oily after a long day
not just great for sun damage
you have to look at your skin for the rest of your life
all without making my skin oily
it is rich enough for winter
even though this "treatment" is for oily skin
it does not become "drying" or feel "gel-like"
especially in the winter my skin get more dryer
i will probably layer on another moisturizer on top because it's really windy where i live
i usually have oily skin
i also use acne cream i use that makes certain parts of my face very dry
or even someone with dry or normal skin
whenever i applied something to my skin
i know my skin will be getting its daily oils
having moved from a humid to dry climate my skin really needed an extra moisture boost
guys with oily skin
never leaves my skin dry
regardless of allergies or dry/humid weather conditions
i get very dry patchy skin in the winter
sometimes on its own or after a serum depending on what my skin needs
does not feel greasy
my make up gets less oily throughout the day
i love the way this applies on a freshly cleansed face it doesn't leave an oily film like some cleaners do
i absolutely love it i couldn't continue their nightamins from warm months to cool bc it wasn't as moisturizing as needed during cool months when i'm more dry
doesn't break me out or aggrevate my highly reactive skin
spreads so far-- you only need a little dab for your whole face
not too heavy for the heat
while i tend to have combination skin this has given me no issues with break outs or extra oiliness
i do not like that it takes much longer than the treatment to blend into my skin
i like the treatment one because it seems to dry quick
doesn't feel greasy at all on my normal-oily skin
or dry me out was impossible
doesn't feel greasy or too heavy
it is not greasy
it would still dry out quickly
this winter i had the worst dry skin ever
retains moisture better than it did before
in the winter months i need more moisture
you might end up with a greasy face if you apply to much
it helped get rid of the dry patches on my face.
this gets worse in the winter with the heat
the cold dry air in albany ny was giving me a few painful dry patches this winter
great for cold, dry winter weather.
can't even have air fresheners around without getting a headache
doesn't make my very oily skin worse
usually i get a few really dry patches during winter
be warned that this is a bit greasy
it does absorb after a bit
probably because they're not full of garbage from less superior moisturizers
i however have a oily combo.
the treatment is good for those people who have a oily t zone/oily
this is really good for dry skin because it has a ingredient that helps pull moisture from the air to help with moisture loss in dry skin
every product i use either feels like water or is too oily
don't let the the extremely thick consistency scare you though
you might be a bit shiny for a little while
he says it doesn't feel thick or heavy on
if you don't mind applying toilet cleaner smell to your face
my face just looks like i have glow not an oil slick like it usually would
i would definitely recommend this product to anyone who suffers from oily skin
btw -great in the winter as it does provide moisture
still not matte enough for me
my face is normally very oily
with this product you get rid of oil
it's the perfect product for him since he'd never agree to using my oil blotting powder
avoid the eye area though as it is drying
which i must admit i was a little concerned about…didn't want to walk around having my face smell like i dipped it in a bowl of cologne
now i don't have to worry about blotting or looking oily
highly recommend this if you have huge pores or oily skin
i tend to get oily through the day
i tend to get oily in my t-zone
i've tried everything under the sun to control my extremely oily skin
if its a super humid
sticky day here in nyc i can apply it over my makeup for a little end of day touch up
it was not oily
this is an amazing product if you struggling with oily skin or perma-shine like i do
does not feel oily at all when applied.
my skin is not so oily in the morning
when i blot with rice paper there is still some oil
it's great for winter time especially when your face is very dry
no matter how many things i have tried my face looks like an oil slick 1 hour after putting on my makeup
i usually put one drop with my moisturizer or if i forget then i put one drop on my palm
doesn't make it oily
to all my ladies out there who is dry / normal/ sensitive /oily//combination : give this oil a try
've been washing my face
this does not leave a residue on my pillow which surprised me
it's really helping me with my dry areas on my face
or i simply lightly set the places i feel like need to look a bit matte
i does not leave you skin feeling too oily
although this product may seem oily
my skin has been all out of whack due to my pregnancy i normally have very oily skin
doesn't seem to get as oily as usual at all
i can get oily on my t zone
it doesn't make my skin oily
without making it greasy
dry in the winter
which i do like a lot in the summer because it's not too wet
it still never seemed to soak in totally or work with my skin instead of sit on top of it
to be honest sometimes especially when it's extra humid i will mix these two together
it seems to just sink in
with this combo my foundation actually stays on my face without feeling dry or caking up
i just apply the oil
the oil leaves your skin feeling satin smooth-i recommend really massaging it into your face when you use it-i use mine at night after a shower when my face is dry
i like it because even when i use too much it sinks into my skin
my lips- i put this oil on as a part of my skin
this oil is like a drink for your skin :
if you put the right amount on then your skin just soaks it up without leaving a gross oily feel
eventually the creams started to dry my skin out to the point where i would have so much texture
why does mine drip so much oil fast?
it just dispenses oil so quick i have to work fast with it
my skin is so dry, especially in the winter.
especially if you have drier skin
i like my josie maran argan oil better because it soaks in more
used it on my dry
when i get dry patches on my skin
so the next time i put my moisturizer on first then mixed a little bit of make up with a small amount of it
honestly it's not an oil i'd use in my skin care routine
where i tend to have dry spots
figured out maracuja oil actually helps lighten them
it doesn't give me that crunchy wet look
this oil doesn't feel greasy or heavy on the skin
i normally apply a few drops after i wash my face
i could not believe how creamy my foundation applied
a bit oily at first
it is not greasy at all
my skin is dry so that is why i combine the two oils
my skin is usually kind of dry
unless you have super dry skin
i mostly use it at night for some extra moisture
the way i make sure i don't get greasy when i use this is i mix 2-3 drops with my serum
bought this product because i had dry patches on my face to the point where it was peeling
i either use this underneath my moisturizer or mix it right into it usually before bed
it never makes my face more oily
in the mornings i'm not too oily
it works great for keeping your face moisturized without leaving any kind of oily-ness on your skin
then top off with whichever moisturizer i happen to have
feels more dry much faster
this doesn't feel heavy or greasy
the rest of my body is dry
for you face it just absorbs right in
amazing oil not work on my face i have oily skin
sometimes other times of the day if i feel like my skin can use a little refreshing
my skin would get dry
can't really tell if this oil is the solution to dullness or uneven skin tone
not only does it help oily skin
my other areas are less oily
it doesn't break out my sensitive skin
my skin would get so dry in he winter
i already have oily skin
the eye dropper feature will make it a sanitary "share" if you don't get careless
touch the dropper to anything while trying it
i stay way more matte all day
while it does go on a little greasy
not only do i use it on my face, but on my hair.
the two best ways to use it are just rubbing it into your face before bed or putting a few drops on your brush before makeup
i like that my skin isn't as dry
when i wake up the next morning my face is not an oil stick which shows me that there was no need for my pores to secrete any extra oil to prevent my skin from drying out
the heater on inside are not friendly to our skin
i live where its very dry
i don't like to use oil products on my face.
i get tons of compliments on my skin now!
usually only in winter because i get so dry
this cream is easy to put on
it goes on with no residue
not oily when you apply it
you can feel it tightening the skin
not quite enough for me now that the weather is colder
because it's still winter i require something with a more greasier substance
you only need to use a tiny bit of the very light cream
i love the fresh cucumber in my water so what better than to have it in my face cream:
put a little of this under your eyes while you sleep
its not overly greasy just perfect for laying foundation on
ts not so light either that it disappears right on application into the skin
keep coming back to this as it feels thin enough that it won't clog pores
helps with any dry patches during the winter
i feel like if i dont have enough moisture my skin will create oil to make up for it -- which is what my skin does with this product
for my skin its not enough
not greasy at all
i am not sure that i would use this cream every day since it is a bit thick
t tends to dry my face a little bit
after putting it on my skin it will dry
it didn't cause any piling
i give this product 4 starts because i prefer pump rather than jars
my dry skin needed something a bit more heavy.
if i only use the product on its own my face doesn't quite have the same dewy look or feel
we both have dry skin.
if i don't put moisturizer on as soon as i get out of the shower my face gets red
i can put it on very lightly or layer more on if the weather is very dry
so my skin takes a beating in the dry atmosphere of the icu
my skin just drinks it right up
needed something that took care of dry
it's super dry around my mouth due to me being on accutane
i feel its a bit oily for me
use another cream that is not to oily on my skin
didn't get as much relief from the expensive cream
like this a little more because i get that silky feeling with this
its the only thing that helps me with my hormonal break outs
i don't like heavy face creams so this is great for me
sometimes i add in two drop of seaberry oil for extra moisturizing if my skin is really dry
does not leave a greasy or oily texture afterwards
i like how my skin doesn't feel dry or tight
does not make my face look oily even though i have oily skin
it's a perfect moisture replenisher without making me oily or irritating existing breakouts
it never fails to make my skin look plump
i am currently using it as my night-time moisturizer after clinique's dramatically different started to feel too greasy on my skin
also doesn't make my face oily
doesn't leave skin oily or heavy
my problems with dry skin have really been sorted out
for the drier parts of my face
definitely would recommend for people with oilier skin
i am dry skin and use it for summer,feel good
it doesn't feel greasy or heavy at all
definitely recommend this for those with normal to dry skin
either it felt to heavy
greasy or it felt like it didn't moisturize enough
my face doesn't get extremely oily or breakout
although if you have really dry skin
it kind of smells like one of those green juice drinks where you feel like you are drinking a plant
the ingredients are pretty clean too.
i like it because it does soak into the skin
not heavy or greasy
however i have normal to dry skin
it does not leave my skin oily at all.
this product to me is like water for my body.
irritate your skin from applying it like 5 times in one day lol
dry out my skin under my eyes now because of not using this properly
the most i can do is soften
it hurts sometimes to put pressure there
i've never had it sting or irritate
irritation does occur if it gets inside my eyes
it's basically a toss up off what will work for your skin
i love the smooth, clear, no -greasy formula too.
when they apply the cream
it does mine too if i put this on the tops of lids
otherwise it doesn't sting
this product is getting rid of stubborn fine lines
absorbs quickly you can use this in the morning under your eye make-up
almost acts like a primer instead of making your make up cake like some eye creams can do
it can burn your eyes if you rub it when it's just applied
you just need to use a small dab
m not really in need of an eye repair cream yet
unlike other eye creams this did not leave my skin oily
when you rub it in
my eye area is so sensitive i cannot usually put anything around them without instant redness
it did not irritate my eye area or dry it out.
t doesn’t stay greasy on my skin
didn't have any burning or uncomfortable sensation
it does seem a little thick out of the container
you might want to buy a couple of tubes to completely vanish your scars
let it soak in
t makes it a little harder to blend your foundation
doesn't dry out my skin
this product does its job without drying out skin
if i could bathe my face in this i would
i applied this frequently to the cut she made on my skin
the scars were so dark you could always kinda see them through the concealer
since skin cannot get better without proper moisture
for those of you who say it is sticky
that was so drying
i doesn't dry my skin nor does it burn
so just follow up with whatever face wash
for some reason my skin was going through some weird dry/peely phase
if you're on it i suggest a weekly scrub in a hot shower
the scrub really helped remove excess tissue that probably wouldn't of been removed otherwise
unless you are ready to put down massive amounts of money on microdermabrasion then you're stuck to figure out what to do
i got this on a whim because i like the kate somerville pimple drying solution
a little bit of concealer my skin looks wayyyy better now than it did in high school
my skin rarely breaks out now!
your skin will get pretty dry at first
i always put it at night then in the morning i use argan oil to avoid the dry patches that retinol can cause
the packaging is not ideal in that i always end up having to kind of squish the tubing to get every last drop
it is gentle though so you don't end up with a scaly face though
until your skin gets used to it
i don't use it every night because i have normal to oily t zone skin
i always put a facial oil on top because of retinol's drying effectsit is extremely normal to break out after starting to use a retinol product
my skin looks dull compared to what it looks like when i just wake up with this one face
they were all sticky
you only need a little bit of this thick cream
rich so one pump is enough for your entire face
it doesn't cause me to peel
it didn't add to the oil
it can be drying
your skin will adjust in matter of 3 days
don't apply it to dry patches
it might be better for combo to dry skin.
it doesn't make my sensitive skin break out.
peel when you first start to use them
i might start applying it under my moisturizer so that it can sink directly into my skin
or they are too drying
it doesn't break out my skin and i'm 24.
doesn't break me out so overall pretty good except for the pilling
it really does work from the root of the wrinkle
this cream is not heavy or oily.
like any retinol product when you first start using it your skin needs to get used to it
i really like how this moisturizer is not sticky when it dries
its unfortunate they don't put it in a pump because that means bacteria can build up
horrible combination skin in the winter
it got to the point where not even blotting powder
if you are an oily/combination skin type
does not leave it oily plus it does not feel heavy on my skin
if you suffer from oily skin
i love this product simply for nourishing my skin without breaking me out
i never really found a moisturizer that prevented my oily skin from becoming more oily until a sephora consultant suggested this product
hydrates my skin just enough without leaving me that greasy feeling
somehow controls my oil really well
the only thing is that the texture of this cream doesn't spread around my whole face easily
it got too oily for summer
it does not dry my eye area
more importantly i don't get oily during hot days
i also wish they'd have put this into a pump bottle rather than a tub
i always feel bad having to stick my fingers directly into the cream adding all sorts of gross bacteria
this is the only moisturizer i can wear under make-up that does not increase oily skin issues
no breakouts--it feels soothing--especially if i get a bit of a sunburn because i missed putting spf on a portion of my neck
you get a large amount for $65 it's so worth it for oily skin
usually have difficulties with products making my skin either too oily or too dry
this cream made them disappear!
my skin is no longer dry at all
continues to clear it up when something else causes a flare up
not oily at all with this gel
i never feel greasy
doesn't make your skin feel oily
it feels like a splash of water on your skin
drier skin types could use this as more of a "serum" product if they need more moisture
my skin tends to get oily by mid day
i really considered returning this because it does not leave your skin matte or absorb oil
if your skin was less oily than mine
it also doesn't leave my skin oily
when i try skin care
i do use a skin care line from sephora that is a bit pricey
just minutes after being absorbed into the skin i can feel a very mild tightening effect on my skin
5 min after i apply my makeup i have to re-powder because it's already oily again
this will sop it up
yet not greasy in the least
i would consider my late 30s skin to be moderately oily
found that it was just moisture
does not make me oily at all
most oil-free does not hydrate enough
my skin is not shiny during the day
it seems like it would be a great primer under my bare minerals
turned out to be a lot thicker than i expected a gel moisturizer to feel so can really only apply immediately post shower
i needed to switch my skin care regimen for the summer because my skin was becoming too oily
my skin needs less moisture than it does during the winter
my skin would feel super greasy at the end of the day
probably not enough moisture for the winter months
i will say it has not done much for my oily skin.
a little goes a long way so you don't have to apply too much just a thin layer to cover your face
its more like half gel half cream which is perfect for oily skin in the dead of winter
heavy enough to actually moisturize any dry spots you might have
i normally can't wear a moisturizer during the day because i will have an oil slick within an hour
previous products tried either felt like elmer's glue
my skin wouldn't hesitate in letting me know in the form of an unsightly pimple
for me, this is the product that rocks my face.
i must mention though that i have oily skin
i did find the product to be slightly drying even following it up with my normal moisturizer
i did notice that this was a little drying
so at night when i apply it before bed i add some vaseline on top to help hydrate
nothing topical will get rid of them
not greasy at all
buy does temporarily make them seem less puffy
i like that you can use the product without exposing it to air
burns if used too much
doesn't dry my eye area
it has not dried me out either
i feel my skin tighten after using it
thick like an eye cream so don't expect that
t really doesn't provide any moisture by itself
allowing to dry well you can tap on a moisturizer if you need one
if your skin isn't sensitive at all
just because this is marketed as an eye cream does not mean you can't use this as an all over face serum
it didn't irritate my skin at all
it does feel drying
can dab only as much as i need
this gel is not a miracle worker so don't expect surgery smooth under eyes
found that even though i have aging skin the creams were too rich for day time use under makeup
bought this after long to long hours of research i liked that it was in a dark bottle with a pump i am 25 with porcelain dry skin that skin type shows aging way faster then others yay me
so worth it i already decided if i didnt notice anything in 7 days i would just get a plain under eye cream day 5 i was sold moisturized all day eyes firmer eye lid
there are very few retinol products that you can use on your lids
doesn't irritate at all
it has a very dry finish
it just won't leave a moist finish like a cream
got more moisture during the conditions of dry air in the aircraft
a lot of the bad reviews had to do with the serum over-drying the delicate eye area-
you'll have to start slow
the serums either dried out my skin or did nothing
especially if you live in a dryer climate
lighten cream seems to be doing the trick
definitely need to use a cream w this product as i think it would be too drying w/ out one
with very little cream you cover a lot
the only problem i have is that if you actually get this product in your eye it burns so bad
it hydrates your under eyes which in turn makes them look better
it was the only thing i incorporated into my skin care routine
it is gentle on the eyes so you can rub it in a bit
i do not feel like a residual layer on my skin
usually these little samples just sit in a drawer unused
it gets in your eye it will water
it's definitely one of the 5 eye creams i have in stock at all times
don't really need to be using an eye cream
does not irritate my eyes or hurt if i accidentally get it into my eyes
i love it because it's heavy duty without being too hydrating
not too heavy moisturizer that doesn't aggravate my skin
doesn't look oily at all
i didn't realize how good this eye cream was until i saw it work it's magic on mature skin
until my eye area becomes less dry
a creamy oil you can use for pretty much everywhere
josie maran argan oil no longer had the effect on my skin that it used to
my only qualm is that the temperatures in the summer keep the moisturizer in "oil" form rater than "cream" form
so you have to be a little more careful when squeezing it out onto your h
more like a creamy oil if kept in a cooler environment
i do find myself really stretching my skin to blend it evenly
my skin feels oily for the first 30 minutes or so
i couldn't seem to get rid of the harsh dryness which would cause the cycle to restart
decided to try this for daytime moisture wow.
yes this is made up of many oils
so it will be oily!)
i usually have very dry skin that usually dries out over time when using certain lotions
apply to really dry spots3
i only use it at night since my skin can get oily
it keeps them from getting too dry especially in the winter
great for every dry spot
really it more in the wintertime
if you are over 40 or have dry skin
i live in a condo which dries me out even more
i think i've done it for severe dry spots
don't have to use chapstick when out
my skin is combo/oily during the warmer months
the only thing that doesn't make me break out is this lotion
its great for when you have a chapped nose
this is a great all purpose moisturizer that's not too heavy i especially love putting it on my lips before bed time
it was too oily for my entire face
it does feel oily
although it does initially feel greasy going on
my face gets a little oily because it needs an additional layer of protection
after letting it set in for about 10 minutes you couldn't tell that you had just looked like a basted turkey
i definitely recommend if you have dry skin or need some extra moisture here
so sometimes you may need to blot your palms after applying
this stuff saved my dry skin
i also use it on dry patches
i can also use this on the dry flaky skin that can flare up around my mouth
it doesn't leave greasy marks
i keep a little jar at work
works so well on any dry or tight spots on your face
even though it's a pretty heavy duty oil it still manages to feel really light on your face
doesn't feel like its absorbing
think it may work for very dry skin in the winter
i will say it's not life changing for dry lips
my eye area used to be so dry
love it for my dry areas
which get super dry all year
so you don't have that oily h
it does need to be kept in a cool place or it will melt
people think i get manicured often because of it.
i typically only use it for problematic times with my kin with dryness
this creamy oil has saved me this winter by applying on my face
much needed for my hands in this winter weather.
must-have for dry skin!
can be used as a pick-me-up to dry skin during the day or on cuticles
this week i discovered that it is the only thing that will heal my winter chapped lips
it save my mom skin from dryness as she is 92 years old finely we found something all purpose that help her all over face body h
s are always dry
blemishes somehow clear up when you would think a cream like this would cause blemishes
i also use it on my lips when they become chapped
when i put it on zits they seem to heal in record time
thick moisture right where you need it
my skin has been feeling great- even with the cold winter temps
unless you have desert dry skin
i mix it with my blush for a different make-up look sometimes
i pat a tiny amount over my make-up if it's looking dry
especially under my eyes- i hate those dry make-up lines
it doesn't seem to sink in quickly
this is an argan oil based cream that goes on a bit oily
is much easier than having an actual oil drip right off your fingers before you can even apply it
s if they are feeling dry
i mix a little of this with my face cream
my skin tends to be normal during summer
a little dry in winter
really sensitive dry skin everywhere else
for as long as i can remember i have this strange texture skin underneath my eyes
use it with my foundations when my skin is a lil too dry because i didnt think of using it like that :
in the summertime without any extra oil on my face
strong enough to moisturize yet light enough that it doesnt sit heavy on my skin
before this i would just use coconut oil
not leaving my skin oily in the morning
my only complaint would be that it takes longer than my argan oil to sink in
it works pretty well at moisturizing my face before i put on make up
my skin still gets flakey by the end of a work shift
they tend to sit on the skin
i only use it at night because it hydrates my skin so much
i like to wear it under my eyes over the argan milk
when you rub it in it turns into an oil
all around treatment for any dry areas on my body
i usually mix some of this into my night cream
then apply a little extra of it on places are extra dry
this creamy oil was a great way for me to add more moisture to my skin during the harsh winter months
cuz i have to warm up lamer cream first by my four fingers then padding it into my skin
most of time i have to use a lot of lamer cream to keep my skin not drying out
i recommend it to those who have dry skin
the cream is not too think nor too watery
does not burn or tingle on application
sinks into your skin so evenly you can just wear it alone or under make up
of course it doesn't make wrinkles go away permenently
they make my eyes water
i will never use another eye cream
not at all greasy
does not irritate the sensitive eye area
i find this eye cream works well in this weather
i do not recommend if you're using this for puffiness or dark circles
this is the only eye cream i've ever used that does not irritate the skin around my eyes
also use it on my lips when they get dry
i've had issues with eye cream where it didn't feel like any cream on
light but rich and non-greasy.
sometimes the under eye tissue is so crepey that if i rub my eyes the skin will stay that way
it didn't make my lids overly greasy overnight either
it is already helping diminish the "crepe-y" look of them
i live in a very dry climate
it feels a bit thick when you apply it initially
i hate sleeping with it because oil doesn't dry
recommend it to anyone who has dry skin
i don't have that annoying dry skin around my nose when i apply foundation
this product is perfect for dry, winter skin.
s or face feeling greasy like some other products
i didn't find that is was effective until after i exfoliated my skin well
this mask is always on my shelf just in case my skin gets overly dry or sensitive
having dry/combo skin is so hard in winter
seriously dropped from heaven above because it has saved my skin from the peely grossness that is dry skin
definitely not a "surge" of moisture
i stopped using the regular moisture surge because once using the gel it felt tacky
if i use a sheet face mask the first thing to absorb all of the juices is my t-zone
not as often because i feel bad about too much waste from used sheet masks
winter when i must turn to super heavy oil creams
you do not have to rinse this off in the morning
i usually have combination/oily skin.
my skin became so dry it burned to put anything on it
this is a nice moisture mask that is not to heavy
if you're into an overnight mask this is a good one
i just make sure i give it some time to soak in before hitting the pillow
it actually absorbs into your skin before you go to sleep
i can still feel the moisture in my skin when i go to wash my face at night
to sort of "seal in" the moisture all day or night
i need extra help to stop from getting it dry
this helps keep my skin in check
that's okay since my skin will absorb it through out the day
decided to use it this winter when my skin was super dry
don't use this on oily skin.
i get pretty dry in the winter
especially in the cold winters we have here
my skin is a lot less dry
if your skin is dry you need this in your life.
even for my super oily skin i wake up
depending on how dry my skin is
nothing seemed to work- they either case me to break out or to have really oily/greasy face
this moisture surge overnight mask from clinique is by far the best one i've tried for my skin
it doesn't feel sticky or heavy
without anything heavy or greasy
my skin feels as if it couldn't possibly absorb any more moisture
i save this mask for when i really have some dry skin going on
i like how thick it is
because i wanted the moisture
however, it doesn't have a heavy feeling when on.
this works well for my dry aging face
this is my holy grail for dry skin especially in the winter time
absolute life saver for dry winter skin!
i only get oily at my nose area
this doesn't make it any more oily
i recommend this for dry-combination skin because it repairs flaky skin/dry patches
i would not recommend this for those with oily skin types because this product does nothing to help minimize the oil on your skin
this is because i know 100% that i can use this on top of my pimple-covered skin without fear of my break out getting worse
i would only recommend using this under make-up if you have dry skin
your make-up might get cakey if you don't give it enough time to absorb into the skin
i don't use this regularly since i have oily skin
i can use it on the few occasions where my oily skin actually gets a little dry
i couldn't get past the texture
super sensitive skin so finding an oil free night cream is a nightmare
i got this because the winter weather was making my skin very dull
i never remembered the moisture surge line of products being all that great
when i stopped accutane my skin was still very dry
i like that you leave it on all night so your skin really has a chance to drink up the moisture
the weather is very cold now
feels a bit sticky when its first applied
you can feel the moisture on your skin all night long
everyone knows when you blow your nose every other minute it gets flaky
when i apply it at night it absorbs pretty quickly
though not all dry everywhere
the bitter nyc cold dries up my skin so bad.
i only need a little bit of moisture in the morning
on very dry cold days
can look oily when i use a product that's too heavy
i don't usually go for moisture surge anything for my face
my skin doesn't need to produce extra natural oil at night hence no new surprise breakouts in the morning
although the description does not say it is for oily skin types
i would strongly suggest not using this if you are oily/combo oily
i tend to get dry skin around the fall
you just need a dab when you use it.
if you use the same amount you would for a regular face mask it feels really greasy
my skin used to be very dry--sometimes the skin around my eyes would get so dry i couldn't even wear makeup
now that my skin isn't dry anymore
you can feel how supple your skin is when you wash your face in the morning
so now i use it as a spot treatment for dry patches in the morning before applying my makeup
i couldn't tolerate it on my face for overnight wear
have to remove it within minutes because it feels dirty to me
i no longer use daily moisturizer on my face because this product does the trick overnight
let the mask sink in while i sleep
all my fellow dry skin ladies out there
it also doesn't flake or break apart.
worry that products that offer intense moisture will break out my skin
that doesn't leave a long lasting oily feel
our apartment is also very dry as we cannot control the heat level
that sucks all the moisture from your skin as well
so things were really not going my way for moisturized skin
like i have never had a dry skin in my life
though it might feel a little bit oily when i wake up in the morning
after dried the skin you will be surprised
i wake up with such great skin
it's definitely a long lasting moisturizer unlike something you can get with glamglow thirsty mud
not oily at all
sometimes gets really dry areas that just won't stop flaking
it got rid of all of my dry patches!
have dried out my skin like other
the mask didn't irritate it at all
it tingles a bit when you apply it
it doesn't dry out my skin
it also seems to clean off my sink easier than the other br
it doesn't dry out
it definitely doesn't strip my skin
it burns a little bit for me
i don't notice a whole lot of difference in the "clearing out impurities" part
removed it just with warm water
im so surprised that it can clean out the blackheads on my nose
it's best for dry region or normal to dry skin believe in me
skin feels greateasy application w the brushcurious how my face will look tomorrowcan easily get 3/4 uses from pod
i don't use face masks very often
it's very nice to not have to worry about them drying out
whenever i buy a large container i feel like i don't get a chance to use the whole thing before it dries out
most of my mud masks tend to dry my face except this one
it doesn't dry hard or get flakey
it doesn't dry lighter or show the dots where oil is absorbed
ing is that this masque shouldn't really be left to dry on your skin
hasn’t been exposed to air – once you open it i think there will be some level of oxidization
provided you have a nice thick layer of the product on you will see it start to ‘pull’ something from your pores
i get most of it with the wash cloth
the mask itself feels like it's warming up with you put it on
its a good, not too heavy, not too light cream.
the only negative thing about thisproduct is that it does look like you have mud or poo all over your face
it's very pleasant to put on especially with the brush
it does tingle a bit when you first put it on
you just have to refridgerate it in a ziplock
cold when you put it one to
normally i would stay away from mud mask
for it dries my skin so badly after 15 minutes stay
the only downside is that it makes my skin feel burning when my face is not in a good state
the brush makes it easy to put on
most importantly it doesn't irritate or dry out my sensitive skin
after you wash it off
that could get messy
every mask i have tried either makes my face super dry or irritated
the wei hydrating face pad switching them out as needed would work wonders for anyone with dry or combination skin
t wouldn't dry out
not dry or tight like some masks do
you get a lot in the pods
it's not too drying on the skin.
it didn't dry out my skin at all
doesn't dry your skin
you can get three masks out of each little tub
i am always trying clay masks to help with my oily skin
i personally like the individual pots it comes in as it makes less mess
your actually wasting your money cause your drying out the clay
your face won't get all that goodies that the mask can provide cause your cutting your self short
applying it with the brush immediately relaxed me
there's so much product in these pots you can easily get 2 facials from each one
its so much better for your skin
you have to come up with your own way to reseal it
t doesn't dry out
it feels like i was applying chocolate onto my face
i let it sit on my face for 10 minutes then i rinsed off with warm water
the mask does not irritate my face
not too strong or burning
i like the brush it comes with
this one is a little different in that it is a wet clay
only 4 stars because it does not work as well as the brazilian peel
let it completely dry
as it dries on my face i can see white "stuff" being pushed out of my pores
enough to do spot treatments with just one cup
t does not dry out
since a smooth layer is all you need to really get results
it does not seem to irritate my dry/normal parts or aggravate the oily parts
hoping that it would not irritate my skin since it felt so smooth
this seemed to really give the blackheads a run for their money :
decided not use it until i was done with my origins mud mask
after i used this i can easily clean up all those dirty things
i honestly bought this product mostly because of the brush
it helps tremendously to have that brush because i feel like i'm able to put the mask on more evenly
sparingly then if i just used my fingers
i can easily get 3 masks out of one pod.
all of the sudden all your pores seems to open as if they are trying to catch the purest deep fresh air
it doesn't leave a residue which i've noticed with other products
after you wash it off
it doesn't leave your skin dry or tight afterwards
i just love the little brush that comes with it too
there is enough product in the cup to cover your entire face
worth trying out if you have sensitive, dry skin!
doesn't really make your face sticky
a little goes a long way i have normal to dry skin
i could tell it was smoothing out my wrinkles too
this is one of the only things that works without leaving an oily residue
the pump on it means plenty is left in the tube that won't pump out when it's almost done
people state they felt like it doesn't absorb into the skin
it doesn't seem to absorb into the skin
t doesn't have any skin tightening properties
it may seem pricey because the tube is very thin compared to other moisturizers of this size
i even use it in the day when i'm very dry
it doesn't absorb extremely quickly
i feel like it does not absorb completely into my skin
it still is not absorbed when i got to bed 4 hours later :/ i feel like i'm going to rub it all over my pillow cases
you can spoon out another good week's worth of product
i can only imagine my face looking super greasy
without irritating my sensitive skin or making me break out
this one doesn't made me feel oily at all instead gave me enough hydration
i will recommend this to anyone whose skin is dry
just a few areas on my face that need that extra moisture
i am still trying to find that hg of non-greasy yet
this is good if you have really dry skin.
this is a nice moisturizer for when my skin is feeling a bit tight after washing -- perfect for the cooler
i definitely need something lighter for warmer nights
this product keeps me from even feeling like i'm on accutane
it is not greasy or sticky.
my skin felt dry upon waking until i started using jojoba oil with it
may even suit skin that is just slightly dry.
it was super dry before
didn't leave my face looking greasy or oily
let it absorb overnight
it would be a great winter cream.
was worried it would end up making my skin oily
they did not disappoint with this super-charge overnight moisture
getting drier as i get older
it works really well on dry skin.
its thick texture makes it great for those dry patches in fall/winter
i almost cannot stop touching my skin because of how soft it is now
i like the tube form better than if it came in a pot too
i love that it doesn't get greasy or "slick" like some night creams
buy this if your skin has been beat by the winter weather
in just a small amount of time it has totally brought moisture back to my face my dry peeling skin is gone
not heavy consistency too it
one pet peeve of mine is when night moisturizers make my skin feel like it's sweating under it
wish the spf rating was higher since i am getting the same feeling of a light residue/film on my skin that a regular sunscreen has anyway
i like the way it looks on my bathroom shelf
this may work better for normal to oily skin.
not at all greasy
it didn't make my face shiny at all
f you're a dry skinned type this is not for you
i happen to be combo oily in the summer
great for folks with oily or combo skin.
not bad for summer because its not sticky or heavy
so far it gives me more glowy healthy look rather than oily
in those super cold days
i usually follow it with a facial oil on the driest parts of my face
i don't feel any pilling if i put on primer right after
yet not greasy to the touch
i don't feel oily at all when i wear this.
it's always hard to wear any type of sunscreen on my face without breaking out
the smell of typical sunscreen has always made me sick so this stuff wins in that area as well
is never oily or heavy
the spf can make you especially oily looking around the t zone
though when i know i'm going to be in full sunlight for a long time
dewiness that is hard to find in a spf
protects me from the sun without the irritating effects i usually get from sunscreen
t would be a good idea to reapply if you're out in the sun often
it is not thick
light, not greasy, doesn't make your skin white.
could be a problem if you have dry skin
my t-zone might be slightly oily
this is the only spf moisturizer i have been able to find that doesn't make me break out
all the morning moisturizer i've used either made my t-zone more oily or made it sticky
i really like it because it gives me a long day moisture needed
i really like this moisturizer because it does not feel heavy at all
does not leave a thick or greasy residue
doesn't leave your face feeling like u just put sunscreen
the oil goes away if you use a mattiying primer before your make up
i definately have to blot during the day which iw not normal for me
overall, this would be great for dry skin
i usually hate using moisturizer during the day because it tends to leave me greasy
provides just enough moisture without making my skin look or feel oily
love that it has sun protection too!
make me seem oily during the warmer months
does not leave a greasy film
i don't have to reapply my foundation because oily skin is shining through
there is little to no fragrance since they don't add anything artificial
i don't notice it after it dries
it is not oil free but it does not feel greasy.
it doesn't make my skin oily or feel greasy.
also doesn't dry out my skin unlike the shiseido oil free sunscreen
many products make me feel like i'm putting on a full layer of sunscreen as though i'm going to the beach
did not burn and the product has a nice texture.
the winter weather is arid
it isn't too thick and gets absorbed right away.
my skin can be oily with some dry spots
if you've been hesitant about using other 30 spf's due to that heavy greasy feeling
no matter what you can still see little patches if dry skin through my foundation
i might not use it over the winter as it does seem a little thin
here you get a high sun protection factor without the heavy
colder places as well as the dehydrating airplane atmosphere more often than i'd like
it also worked well to protect my face on a recent caribbean vacation even when the spf 50 lotion on my shoulders started to fail me
i mix in some face oil
doesn't leave me greasy
don't even wake up oily
when i have a cold
otherwise, your pillow will get all the benefits!
have never found a moisturizer that has made my skin look so good so fast
without making me look greasy
i do not use primer as i feel too many layers just make me so greasy
the oily t zone does not get too oily.
anything that may be oil clogging
wish it was in a pump bottle though- the jar is al little unsanitary having to dip fingers in every time
it doesn't make my oily skin greasy
but doesn't dry my skin out.
as the weather gets colder
am not greasy from using this
it was never too heavy back in the hot humid place
not making it too oily
summer moisturizer to get me through the rough texas heat
have been able to tell that my face feels moist
which usually i wouldn't like due to dry skin
this product doesn't dry my face out while making it matte
depending on the weather or condition of my skin.
my skin will sometimes have a dry patch
sometimes it is just really dry in places
it deals with oily skin really well.
or get something with spf instead
i like to use this in the daytime for moisture.
so for me any oil will make my t-zone more oily
when i put it on before bed i feel like i don't have to do anything to my face in the morning- i wake up with soft supple
it'll moisturize the heck out of your skin without leaving an oily/greasy film on it
really helps control oil without making the dry parts of my skin flaky or tight
it's hard for me to find a moisturizer that doesn't make my skin feel greasy or breakout
immediately took care of my oily areas
have combination to oily skin like i do
otherwise they are too sticky
did not leave a cakey/oily residue when i applied or when i wear it for long
however i do no think it would hold up in the winter when my skin is at its driest
i would say it will work fine with anyone with normal to dry skin
not only has my skin become more luminous i've notice i'm not as oily
i put this on some nights when my skin feels super dry
it's hard to find a night cream that doesn't have a sticky finish
my skin never once felt tight or uncomfortable even though this was the only hydrating step i used
doesn't feel sticky or heavy on the skin
skin drinks it up so you don't end up sticking to your pillow
just let it soak in
my skin is combo and this does not make it oily.
s thick so you don't need a lot to cover your face
made a mess on my face kind of dry
or just as anytime treat for your skin
said she needed to add a good amount of moisturizer because my skin felt really "dry"
seriously my skin just drinks it up
if you need amazing moisture this is the oil for you
see how soft your skin is in the morning
it will give your thirst for moisture face a rescue
it cleared my dry winter skin right up!
i love this because i can feel the moisture in my skin all day
i wouldn't recommend this for 'emergency' dry patches
i can't imagine someone with oily skin using this product
doesn't break out those with oily skin
some people say this product breaks them out because it is on the thick side
i apply this after a face oil because my skin needs the extra moisture
it does not irritate my skin
they were either too oily or too light for my sensitive/combination skin
i needed one that would be perfect for my dry patches
i don't feel the oil on my skin
sometimes during the day if i'm too dry
because i have oily
let it all soak in- i wake up with amazing skin
i live in a very dry climate
not greasy at all
make sure to use only a drop or two for your face if you might end up greasy
i also liked to use it on especially dry spots on my body
i heard that tsubaki oil is really good for dry skin
this oil is so amazing for combination to oily skin
because winter makes my skin so dry
so i started to mix this oil with my day cream.
doesn't leave my face oily even with being an oil
i guess it really wasn't penetrating into my skin to lock down the moisture
i like the tatcha oil better
my makeup always tends to cling onto some dry patches
allowing it not to look cakey afterwards :
not greasy or oily at all!
i love this oil because it works to keep my combination skin moisturized in the super dry winters here
you only need 1 or 2 drops mixed in with your moisturizer so while this product seems expensive it will last a ridiculously long time even with everyday use
this facial beauty oil didn't make it any worse
i think it helped make me less oily because my skin feels healthier
this oil is a little less greasy
i think any kind of facial oil does a great job of keeping oil at bay
my face is less oily than usual
it helps to hide dry spots that sometimes appear under my makeup
as i found it to be quite thick
oily to other parts like my t-zone area
i also don't have super oily areas to my t-zone anymore
i tend to get more oily later in the day
it is more of a glow oily all over rather than just super shiny in my t-zone
normal mositurizersin cream form tends to break me out
it hydrates my face without feeling like i have heavy product on my face
recommend washing your pillows at least every 3 days to make sure that you rest your face on a clean surface every night if you really want great results
i don't feel extra-oily
since it didn't entirely seem to sink it i was worried i was going to wake up with an oil slick on my face
winter weather or when you're feeling in need of a dewy glow
it lasts forever since you only need 1-2 drops.
it is a bit sticky when you initially apply it.
whenever i'm feeling a little dry or flaky
my face gets quite dry
this lovely little bottle of oil has saved my skin this winter
it is not greasy
it doesn't make you greasy at all!!
it doesn't make your skin feel oily at all
for being an oil it isn't oily
no longer sensitized by the dry winter air
i get a lot of flakiness when wearing liquid foundation for filming
i switch back to this oil every winter when the air dries out my skin
have on average pretty normal to oily skin
this absorbs well unlike some oils that feel like they sit on top of my skin
i never go without a bottle of this oil!
using an oil for my combination skin didn't seem the right thing at first
it's really nice for my oily skin i only use use it at night time
i feel like this bottle lasted me a lot longer then the fresh seaberry face oil as well
my t-zone tends to be very oily in hot
it could become flaky
absorbs well if i use the right amount of it
oily since it does feel greasy when applying it
its not heavy or greasy feeling like a lot of oils can feel
if my skin is feeling dry any time during the day i just dab it over those dry ares
putting a little moroccan oil on it on it before blow drying
my skin is never left feeling drier than when i put it on
this provides just the hydration i need without leaving a bunch of product residue
i found out while on spring break if you need extra lubricant in certain areas during a certain activity between two people
doesn't look oily on
or on any dry parts of my body like my h
i started having a lot of dryness on my face this past winter
i still have a hard time smearing oil on my face
then it is not greasy
i would break out in dry patches because of the lack of moisture
i don't have any dry patches anymore
a little extra dry in winter
pretty slick during the hot humid days
and no it does not make my skin extra oily.
i don't rub it in just pat
if you like to use face oil.
i do find that there is a bit of tightening felt once it's absorbed
my face is mostly dry so when i wash it is just just more dry
not too thick to use with my clarisonic
other cleansers that claim to be for sensitive skin have always made me break out
not dry at all
yet doesn't leave skin dry
it smells so good that i find i wash my face twice as long as before just to make the experience last --
if you can gently use around your eyes though
does not leave my face feeling dry or tight like so many others do
use a little bit of water with it to really get it to foam
it does not over dry my already dry skin
except it was kind of hard to wash off
it is not greasy at all
it foams up enough for your whole face
without leaving any residue on your face
after using i love the way a little bit turned into a happy foamy good smelling treat for my face
it does sting if gotten into your poor eye
when you have oily skin like i do
it is not drying nor is it too creamy.
especially when the weather is warm or humid
have dried up so much
it doesn't make me oily either
still oily on my tzone
it does not leave any residue behind
it really gives your face that 24 hour moisture that it promises
need a quick flash of moisture as a base for a quick makeup for the day
does a pretty good job against winter dryness too
when it doesn't control oil
i like to use it alone underneath my makeup on very humid days because it absorbs so easily
doesn't feel greasy or sticky on my normal skin
if you had sensitive or oily skin this might be a nice light option
it did leave a slightly sticky residue behind
it is a bit sticky at first
i can practically feel my skin soaking it up minutes later
it will take too long to soak in
i would definitely recommend this gel cream for anyone who has rosea or any type of sensitive skin issue
my make up does not go on well over this gel cream
i like it when my skin is more normal
t gets rid of any dry areas
i tend to get fairly frustrated when i'm on a hunt for a new moisturizer
definitely make sure to wait long enough if applying a powder foundation
a word of caution for those with truly sensitive skin: i experienced a mild burning/stingy feeling the first couple of times i applied it
usually i get tired of products quickly :
i needed a lightweight moisturizer for the summer since my skin gets a little more oily in the hot humid weather of south florida
of course once winter rolls around i think this may not be moisturizing enough
it seems a bit sticky right after application
i am really liking the way this product quickly absorbs into my skin
easy to work into the skin
it felt like water when applying
in a flaky gross kind of way that cannot be covered by makeup
for that the only thing that helps my dry winter skin is lancer
i've always had a little dry patch on my cheek that i couldn't get rid of
the product is not oily
i no longer have dry patches on my face anymore
i feel that this would prevent my skin from becoming dry
it feels like you are treating your skin to holy water
feels like the ingredients were literally made for your skin
my skin is more dry than oily usually
on days i don't wear makeup i can sometimes smell the lotion even a couple hours later
it absorbs well enough to get rid of any flaky dry skin
my skin still gets oily later in the day
probably not for oily skin?
have found that i need to use something thicker
do not use it for a summer morning otherwise it will make your face oily for the day
one pump does the trick to keep my face soft all day
this is a really big deal for me because it can take multiple applications of creams after serum to get rid of my dryness
i'd probably go for something thicker in the winter months
s kind of dry up
it is non-greasy
i love this fast absorbing gel under my make up.
i still like to use a drop of beauty oil first
may not work as well for super dry skin.
sometimes i got dry patches
try the clay one first of u get oily skin in the summer
it is not heavy or greasy feeling
one pump can cover my whole face
because anything more makes my face feel greasy all day long
mentally the gel takes getting used to if you are accustomed to st
this one never seems to really soak in or dry
i almost feel like that's necessary in order for it to be more hydrating
with other light moisturizers i've always found that they sink in very quickly
prefer it over the super complex 7 face cream which i feel like is a little thick
it had fixed my winter dry
i think it would be too little moisture for me on its own
you really do see improved moisture overall
i loved the fresh cleansing foam so much i went back
takes care of the dry patches i also get
will not take off waterproof mascra or heavy make-up
i find that it works best if my skin is only slightly wet
it could be good for dry skin
don't do well with using things with harsh chemicals at all
it doesn't dry my skin and it does brighten it.
i can feel all the dirt rubbing off my face
i really like it and it foams up really well.
doesn't make my skin feel dry at all
a lot of them are very oily
so only 1 pump is needed to cover your entire face
my old face wash was too drying
this face wash is so worth it.
i don't find it drying at all like some of the reviews-
this is a very lightweight cleanser that definitely gets my skin clean without irritating it or drying it out
even though it is a foam
it is not drying at all
not too dry after use it
the foam is wonderful when i use it with my clarisonic
this is not a normal oil
although i don't slather there
i can tell you the oil was more orange than red
i might have to warn you about the orange tint it gives your face when applying the product
it doesn't disappear completely overnight
does wonders for clearing up my skin
i love how this oil absorbs into my skin instead of sitting on top of my face like most oils do
it used to be less sticky
i love it because i have extra sensitive skin
best thing i have found for my winter skin.
i get really dry and flaky.
any dry skin will be gone
my normally oily/combo skin is drinking this stuff up beautifully
i make sure to massage this oil into my face for a good minute
might end up on your pillow
if you feel dull during the winter
first impression is that it smells awesome however if you apply it wrong it does leave a nice tint of orange on your face because it is so orange
i usually use boscia's tsubaki oil.
for the people who say its too greasy or doesn't absorb
this helps your skin absorb it so much
i would recommend this for dry skin.
i think i've found my new skin care routine
i really like this product for dry skin
but it works for dry skin.
i lfeel it takes a while to absorb so you can't layer another product like sunscreen on right after
or when my face is still wet from the shower
i wear this oil under my foundation sometimes
it is not a clear oil like josie maran
doesn't make my combination skin oily
if you rub/pat it in
if you use a moisturizer after it then it will take the orange tint this oil gives you away
i definitely recommend using it before bed so that you wake up to a great canvas for makeup
i suggest applying 30 mins before bed so that an can sink in properly
i do not get that at all to me it smells like rose hip oil
if you do have a problem with the smell wear it to bed :
just rub it in
it will obviously wear off to the pillow if you immediately put your orange oily face on it so just use common sense
seriously with use i could see a difference in my skins texture
i tend to apply oils at night
as in don't let the serum fully dry before starting to apply the oil or the serum will dry on your freshly cleaned skin
was thinking it will be more or less like my healthy store's rosehip oil -- i
love the smell color does not bother me or transfers to pillow soaks right in
basically looked like a terrible sun burn.
so basically this is for anyone who has dryness
needs a little bit of a kick of moisture
it's not so heavy that you end up looking greasy if you want to seal it in with a moisturizer too
i just wear it under my nighttime moisturizer so that i don't have to go out in public smelling like this
can't speak to how it might feel on an oilier skin type since it is pretty greasy to put on
i added this oil into my skin care routine
doesn't get as oily during the day
it's like fresh sunshine on your face
during the dry season this oil keeps me from drying out more
can sting if you use it too close to eye area
i've noticed that my skin went from oily to dry
those other reviews that talk about how it smells like fish oil
oils don't live up to their hype
because i don't want to have oily skin during the day
the one thing i do not like about this is that it takes a while before it soaks into your skin
i like it because it gives hydration especially under the eyes so when i put on concealer it won't dry my eyes
it almost leaves an oily finish that your make-up will slip off
i figured this would be a good lighter-weight eye cream to try
i do not feel it dried my skin out either like some of the other reviews mentioned
it's also the only eye cream that does not irritate my eyes
i leave it damp
under eye setting powder do not appear dry
did have that wet look
i am trying to use it as more of a preventative plus i wanted to add moisture to my very dry under eye area
not too thick to where you can't apply make up over it
i usually apply it all over my eyes
it corrected all of my dry
i don't feel that the areas around my eyes are dry
i believe it has more to do with washing your face day/night
can get dry very easily
not greasy at all
i only used at night though because it was a bit too moist/thick for under makeup use for me
this eye cream does everything it claims.
seems to take a long time to "soak-in
this cream doesn't irritate them at all
it's tough to find a cream that clams to work on that problem
not thick easy to apply
add to your"beauty dollars that didn't work" pile
my face tends to be very dry in the cold
i love what it does for oily/combo skin in hot
it does not provide enough moisture for my face which tends to be dry when i apply this
not too dry or flakey
i don't use this in the fall/winter when i don't want to appear tan
it's very hard to find a good self tanner for your face when you have such oily skin like i have
thankfully the color didn't stay
since the glowlotion doesn't have spf
make sure though to pat the serum on face
you will feel your skin gets tight after you apply this
which i do now for extra moisture
t getting worse in the summer sun either
on top of that i have really oily skin during the summer
i honestly feel like it provides so much moisture to my very dry skin
it provides so much moisture that my makeup doesn't crease at all
i do believe that that was do more towards its amazing scent i did feel that it left my skin very shiny it had a wet look the didn't really fade out that was slightly disappointing
solely as it's not a super intensive moisture that my skin needs in the morning
the dry areas really need something more heavy
doesn't make it look or feel oily
the only downfall about tho moisturizer is it does not pair well with some of my primer
it is light weight and not greasy.
the moisturizer itself is a gel-like substance that i find to be light on the skin without leaving a greasy feeling behind
i think i would stick with a thicker formula
doesn't make my skin feel oily after
it doesn't dry down in that weird tacky way that a lot of gels do
gives me the moisture i need without making my skin feel oily
i like how it just disappears on my skin
i am so happy that it doesn't make my skin oily after a while
it is not heavy
doesn't make my face greasy
doesn't leave your skin greasy
winter months my skin tends to be on the dryer side
its really great in the summer because heavy products just melt right off in this heat
when i first tried it i wasn't completely sold because i have been using a thicker moisturizer even in the summer to make sure my skin is well hydrated
during the summer time my skin becomes really oily
after using this gel mousterizer it not only hidrates my skin super good
that will balance out my skin
i also like that this doesn't contain sunscreen so that i can apply it both day
my t zone was not greasy or shiny
i loved that it didn't feel heavy or suffocating like a lot of moisturizers can do
i would recommend this for oily to combination skin
drier types could use this in combination with a serum during the day
it is not greasy
strong so beware if you do not like scented products
i usually don't go for moisturizers labeled as a gel or lightweight cause my skin tends to feel dry after using it still
its not heavy or thick by any means
don't take me wrong it dries fast
it barely looks likes i have used any in the jar
it does not leave behind an oily residue.
can tell my skin already feels less dry after only 2 weeks
it also doesn’t make the skin get that tacky feel i sometimes notice with other br
this did not leave my skin feeling greasy even during the warmer temperatures
my face is always dry as a prune
t doesn't make my skin any more oily than it already is
especially in the summer heat
does not leave it with sweaty or oil
it is not thick does not feel in the face
doesn't make my face oily or slick
this product does not irritate my skin
definitely recommend this for anyone with oily skin in the summer
its not too heavy
i absolutely like that this is not very sticky or bulky underneath my makeup
i mostly opted for light face oils or whatever moisture i could get from my sunscreen
would likely not be enough hydration alone for very dry skin
it's definitely a nice burst of moisture in the morning
the origins energy-boosting moisturizer is perfect for those of us whose skin needs a little pick-me-up
doesn't make my skin feel sticky or greasy in any way
i wasn't so sure about the gel at first
doesnt dry on me very fast
once its dry it doesnt leave your face sticky which i love
it has that greasy sensation until it does
so appreciate that it doesn't feel heavy on my face or leave me super greasy midday
even when i wash my face after a whole day i can feel it still on my skin keeping it moisturizer
not so heavy that it feels greasy
makes me oily throughout the day
sometimes products that do that tend to make me face oily
my skin is not needing as much moisture as usual
i never thought i'd find the day that a primer would work for my oily skin
this is not drying.
it never makes it look dry or oily
it did a little better with powder but not much.
the last primer i used gave me pimples which i never get not even growing up
made me sweat like my face could not breathe
doesn't break out my dry
the only reason it doesn't get 5 stars in my books is i prefer something less mattifying as i like a dewy look
not greasy like some other primers
going to start by saying i have very oily skin
i get super dry after washing my overly oily face
sometimes i notice some feeling sticky
my skin is truly combination with an oily t-zone
fairly dry everywhere else
my make stays put all day without getting oily or settling in the wrinkles
not only does it take away the sticky feeling
only if under special condition that you might need a little more oil-control/silky finish
it minimized my pores so they weren't so visible when i wear make up
make sure it is completely dry before you apply your foundation
most importantly keeps my oily skin at bay for hours
not only does this primer work it helps to decrease the size of yours pores while your wearing it
what can help reduce their appearance/help them not get worse is healthy skin exfoliation
feel there is something about the alguronic acid
this primer never beads up like some
i never have to use a finishing powder of any kind
for the dry skin i have
it doesn't make my face look flaky as others
you have that instantly smooth feel you have to wait for like on the non-silicone smashbox photo finish or sephora silicone-free/oil-free primer
it doesn't really make your pores look smaller
it is light not greasy
i find most primers have an oily feel to them after applying
every one that i've tried has left my skin feeling like an oil slick
it can get a little oily on the skin
i tend to go way drier in winters.
there is this dry skin one
both have very thick texture however they sink in completely
absolutely no oil or grease left
therefore i'm already accumulating so rockin' stress-lines
not at all sticky
it doesn't make my oily
occasionally i skip that
my skin is a dry mess now
followed it with moisturizer on my dry days or just primer if my skin was not parched
found it dried my skin out so much
i should say that i was using algenist neck cream
if your skin isn't as dry as mine it should last you four months or so
it lightned sun damaged better than the murad product i was using
it did not cause sensitivity or drying.
did not irritate my skin
i take good care of my skin
my dermatologist recommended i get a retin product to help control my grease face as well as help to reduce these super annoying tiny bumps that never go away
i'd have him burn off with a hot needle like thing which are caused by my combination
i often skip even light coverage foundation because my skin looks great these days without it
it was so good at re-moisturizing perhaps that whatever peeling occurred didn't really matter at the end of the day
it tends to be a little drying
i find it does not make my face oily at all
it gets rid of the dullness for me.
i am usually fairly dry
not oily or too thick
had trouble finding one that didn't cause my finicky
i would have given it 5 stars if the container was easier to open so that i could scrape the last bits of my $100 serum out
this product doesn't dry it
gives just the right amount of moisture without making my skin greasy
does not feel like i have a thick film on my face
not sure it will be enough moisture in the winter
don't wear retinol during the day- if you know this
a little oilier then i like
not at all oily or greasy.
not greasy at all.
some of their products just don't do it for me---like the firming eye serum
this serum is the only one i have ever tried that did not irritate or cause breakouts for my combination to dry skin
apply this to your face n neck on after you cleanse
which is more on the oily/combo side
the reason i look to see how quickly it absorbs because on really hot days when i apply my moisturizer
my face gets a little greasy if it doesn't absorb all the way into my skin first
when i want to wake up with healthy skin i always go for this sleeping facial
i don't use it every night just on certain days when my skin visibly looks tired or dull
not only does this cream feel so luxurious
t can be used during the day for people with extremely dry skin
they just couldn't cut through the dryness on my cheeks
don't see any oiliness during the day
actually it seems to balance out my skins oil
i also hate moisturizers for normal/dry skin because they're too heavy
not too light, not to heavy!
i've tried a lot of skin care
my skin would actually get so dry that it was painful
the way it makes my skin feel- i slather this on at night
if i use a tiny amount of this mask i wake up to soft supple skin which lasts for days before i feel the need to apply more
hydrating face products i try dry my skin out or cause me to break out
i didn't get that burning sensation a lot of face products give me
get really dry skin in the winter
doesn't leave a greasy heavy feeling like some creams do
instead of my skin normally feeling dried out on a long haul flight
if you apply it heavy h
you may feel greasy
especially in the winter when the cold takes a toll on my skin
my skin gets quite dry in the colder months
does make skin feel dry
which tends to get very dry during the winter
your skin takes in the product right away
and it evens out extra oily areas on your face.
how it is not greasy at all
it does not make me more oily
it does not dry out my face
my face is a little dry
i always worry about thick creams on my face at night because i break out easily
this stuff is the reason i didn't shrivel up like a raisin this past winter
i do not need such an intense night cream
my icky dry patches were gone
my face is back to being naturally oily--which i don't mind because i love the dewy look
how can your skin be dry
it doesn't make my skin oily.
only thing that will do the trick in such dry winter weather
i do notice a slight stinging/burning which tends to be worse if i have any dry patches
i feel it made me get blemishes more
it made my face really dry
before if i wanted to keep it on all night i would just put on a thinner layer
not too heavy not to sticky
i would often have dry/flaky skin from it
when i use this product after the retin a i wake up with soft skin
found my skin was getting really dried out
as i have combination/oily more on the oily side
i don't have dry skin
it is wonderfully moisturizing without feeling heavy or greasy on my skin--in fact i often use more in the summer
it is not as oily in the t-zone area
do not rub it in
pat it on the skin instead
because i'm especially oily all over
it did dry my skin a bit
my skin is incredibly oily already so when a coworker recommended i give the lotus oil a try
it is good for dry, winter air.
but if you live in a humid place, be careful.
it might get too oily for you
i kept reading about face oils being super amazing for trying to tame the oil production
dry my face completely
may be just for improving my oily skin
my skin in the morning is barely oily
it doesn't make me oily
my skin can get quite oily
being a vib rouge member you can imagine i've tried everything for oily skin around
whenever i would take my powder out for touch-ups
does not just sit on its surface
it looks oily for a minute
works great for oily skin in the summer
it may be too drying for oily skin
doesn't cause me to break out since i have really sensitive skin
lotus oil truly does help to balance out the oilier part of my face
because it helps so well with my dryness i really don't mind
non-oily all day
i mean dry red
i couldn't leave without foundation cause of my bad skin
instead make my skin better
it is not greasy
next time i may try the one for dehydrated skin
i great out almost immediately even if they are suited for oily acne prone skin
i know it is scary the thought of putting oil on oily skin
this product has helped keep my oily skin under control
why didn't i know about this product when i was a teenager?i have super oily skin with huge pores
then after reading the reviews from people with very oily skin i was scared that this would dry me out
you don't have to worry about smelling like a salad as it quickly fades
i will suggest you rinse your face off as soon as you get up
this is the only product that works for my dry face
doesn't leave any residue
no more dry skin at all
i only use at night because it is dense
shiseido's super restoring cream seems like it was designed for parched skin that's been on a long journey without good food
it immediately takes all the dryness out of your face
it's hard to find a products that does provided adequate moisture with out break outs
literally overnight my skin looked so much better
good for people with dry skin
it was too thick for me
less dry after the very first use
this cream is great if you have dry
it is not heavy
it is a little sticky if you use too much
doesn't clog your poor
i don't notice a strong smell- that could be a batch-based issue since it's made with algae- the only problem is that i find it sticky so makeup doesn't smooth well on top
it does tint my face pink for about an hour it until it fully absorbs
doesn't leave my combination skin feeling greasy or oily
my father even found themselves using it to counter balance the dryness from our cruise
have dry skin this is a winner
if you are blessed with olive or darker skin that is not dry this is probably not for you
did not make oily areas greasy
the 30 spf was even better.
the spf30 makes it my go-to all summer long
yes it does leave a shin on the skin
however give it time to absorb into the skin
maybe it's for dryer skin types?
i never feel greasy
your face will be oily from top to bottom.
you can imagine my surprise when i put this on one morning to find that my skin was incredibly supple
if it can make my extremely dry winter skin oily in the t-zone
was shopping for something that would really soak into my skin
it may be light enough to use as my primary moisturizer once the dry winter skin is no longer a concern
i did not notice any chalky whiteness as mentioned in other reviews
i would always run into issues with spf products burning or irritating my skin
never stuck with it even though my fair skin really needs the sun protection
i think u need a heavier in the winter
i didn't have that heavy sunscreen feeling like some products do
it stayed sticky all day even though the description says non-tacky
don't use too much of it cause it can make you look pasty white
if you don't like the glow, powder over it.
when i put it on it doesn't take long for my skin to soak it up
my face doesn't become oily at day's end when i use this
even though i live in a climate that is hot
absolutely light weight without any chalky feel like some sunscreens leave when trying not to be too oily
but not oily at all.
when you do, it feels sticky on your skin.
the slight dampness allows the product to go on easily without applying too much
it doesn't make my super picky skin break out either
which i like because then i apply a powder foundation
does not break it out or make it oily during the day
however i disgard my sunscreens after the season so this size jar will be perfect to get me through the ny summer
i do reapply often after swimming
i love the nutrients that i know are sitting on top of my skin all day
i love what this product does for my dry skin
i definitely recommend this for women with dry skin who want high spf coverage
it has an spf 30 in it to protect your skin from the harsh sun
i wish it gave me a bit more moisture
when sunscreen is added to the equation my skin can really go berserk
i come from very humid weather
you only have to apply a little of the product to have just enough of a radiance
if you overdue it of course your skin will look oily
i've noticed that i do get oily when i use this product
even though it makes me oily
when i used this i didn't even have to use my normal moisturizer with it
so weather is a factor in my skin care routine
i don't have much of an oil shine at all
at first i was skeptical of using genefique because i tend to have combination oily skin
this gets rid of them.
i just want to bathe in it!
my skin not only tolerate it well
wait a little bit before putting on the moisturizer
it always contain so much wrapping
you will still need a moisturizer if your dry like me in areas
only reason i won't give it 5 stars is because for oily skin this will increase the shine the skin accumulates during the day
night if you're dry
i'd play around with a sample to see if the intensive hydration works for you or makes you oily
you can instantly feel your face smoothen out like a baby
it made my skin so lovely that i would just rock the no make up look all week
although a bit dry in the winter
i would definitely recommend this product for oily skin as this does not make your skin sensitive
just be sure to wash face well after
can get oily with make-up.
not greasy at all- so smooth is goes on like water
you only have use a little bit too so it lasts
my skin is not too dry or oily anymore.
it is not greasy and goes on clear.
feels like you haven't applied any cream
doesn't leave them flaky
never travel without it because my skin acts up in different climates
if you're more oily you can just use this on the high points of your face like the cheekbones
doesn't sit on top of skin or feel greasy
it's not my favourite way to put an oil on my face
you only smell it until the product is absorbed i find
this can be a little oily
in winter very dry
there are a few things i would improve- packaging: i do not like the idea of roller ball applicator
i do not like the idea of using this application method after you just applied lotion to your face
makes my dogs sneeze if my face is in close proximity to them after application of this oil
yes, this oil is good for my oily skin.
doesn't leave my skin greasy at all
the name is apt: it really does seem to replenish the skin
i found that i liked applying it without the roller though
not only did her sunburn seem to evaporate in record time
free of any chemical nasties that cause me to stress over what they may be doing to my body
doesn't break me out or clog my skin
and it does not aggravate my skin.
i generally prefer masks i can use in the shower so rinsing is super easy
i feel like it did help minimize the appearance of my pores
stripping your skin of it's natural oils with a mask isn't going to help
they'd provide some sort of spatula to make the use easier
when applied it almost has a cooling sensation that just perks up my skin
it makes my breakouts go away faster
it somehow manages to deep clean without making my skin dry
btw the more even a layer of this stuff is on your skin the better it works
it doesn't irritate my dry
as for clearing blemishes i have a few on my right cheek i don't think overnight it will make your pimples disappear
here you get many treatments out of one jar!
it left my skin perfectly even upon application
i noticed after application that my skin had a serious dewy looking glow that was not at all oily
i did not love the feel of the mask on my face as it was drying
this made me look like a baby -- not as much as the luna oil
can wait to finish my current peel product
as it dried it did not aggravate my skin
when i rinsed it off my skin did look slightly better
the only thing i didn't like was that it really takes some effort to get it completely rinsed off
once you rinse with warm water you're left with glowing skin as if you just left a facial
i don't mind masks that recommend longer wait time to rinse off
you do have to use a generous amount of the product to get a "thick layer" so the sample was only used 2-3 times by me
sensitive skin that just want a little extra boost to brighten them up
it won't work as a magic to heal those acnes on my chin for sure
don't know if it suits those super sensitive skin
like it when i need a little glow
i also love that it is super effective without all of nasty chemicals other br
the jar is small so i use it very sparingly.
removed all the dry dead skin patches from the dry winter weather
by itself it doesn't cover enough or glide well.
i still feel a little dry after i apply this
effective for my dry skin in winter
this is the first moisturizer i've tried in a long time that has not burned my skin when i apply it
doe not leave my face glossy like other oils do
my skin can get patchy at flakey during winter months
it makes my dogs sneeze if they come to close proximity of my face
i no longer have dry patches
every other cream i tried for dry or sensitive skin was too thick
then apply this while my face is still moist
all they seemed to be doing was drying out my skin
it doesn't dry my skin out
works better on dry skin in my opinion.
they do recommend to use it on dry skin.
i leave the product on my dry face
then i get to use my clairsonic too for a deeper clean
also kind on your skin
wont make your skin feel dry
i typically use it over dry skin
it works if you skin is wet
you get the deeper clean with dry skin
which i suspect because i do not wash my face clean enough
scrubbed much too hard
any exfoliatior shouldn't be scrubbed hard on the skin
often just odd skin i have tried almost anything to even my complexion
i find that i have to use another cleanser for the eye area which is a little annoying
this product rinses much 'cleaner' if you use it in this way
i do however use a pump of sunday riley ceramic slip afterwards just because i'm oily/combination-skinned
makes your face so smooth in a such a short time
forget about the surface
i find it gentle enough to use morning
which when i use in the shower gets me a bit nervous
use this cleanser my skin honestly looks better than it does with foundation on
great for people with dry skin.
this cleanser is so good it doesn't make my skin dry afterwards or strip it either
i found out that stripping the skin from natural oils is not good
i apply it to dry skin
not icky chemicals--that make this product the wonder that it is
this only works if you use it on a dry-ish face
for example i usually take my makeup off the regular way then tap dry my face
i tend to wash my face twice.
finally glad to find a toxic-free
i find that using it twice a day is a bit too much as it is grainy
great treat for your face!
frankly, the product is drying.
gentle enough for everyday.
does not irritate skin at all
otherwise my skin is clear
doesn't dry your skin out
i generally do not use scrubby cleansers as they tend to simply cause damage to the skin
it doesn't irritate my skin at all
it didn't dry out my skin either.
it doesn't dry out my skin at all
my skin is generally really oily in some spots
extremely dry in others
had resigned myself to the idea that cleansers aren't meant to improve your skin
just wish they made a smaller bottle for infrequent exfoliators
be careful if using for everyday use unless you're super oily as the micro beads do a great job of sloughing off oils/dead skin
everything i apply to my skin i take a deep breath
it was no longer dry/flaky
without any oily feeling or visible shine
one pump can cover your whole face
even better if you use toner
i don't know if it actually exfoliates
one week in i'm still using it alone because it is so moisturizing that i don't feel the need for another layer
or for extra-dry skin types
really does help my extra dry cheeks
however i will definitely buy it again when i run out because i absolutely love the cooling roller ball underneath your eyes when applying it
it's cold coming from the refrigerator
i wouldn't want it to feel cool or cold under my eyes all day
the applicator/packaging on this is great-i haven't experienced any irritation or break outs either
it does have a really nice cooling sensation when applied
i don't have to use my fingers to rub this in.
i let it soak in on its own.
not sure if it works so well with puffiness though
the puffiness did shrink on the eye i used it on compared to the one that i didn't use anything on
as in right as you tap it in your puffiness is gone
it is not sticky or oily
doesn't leave my skin sticky
i leave it in my refrigerator to get an extra cooling feeling
especially just to pamper yourself during the hot summer months
once absorbed you don't get the sticky feeling.
it has a water like feel
i can already feel the moisture staying in my skin
i feel like it doesn't give me that moisture that i desperately need this winter
yet didn't offend my sensitive skin or make me oily throughout the day
it's too early to tell if it has lightened my skin though
it does feel cooling when applied which is nice.
it didn't leave my face dry
you only need a tiny bit to get a thick lather
i can say i very rarely get pimples now while using this wash
i will never use another face wash again.
i find that it's non drying
really oily in the summer
super dry everything else
it can be very drying
i only needed a tiny amount because it foams very well
does not get oily
this product is very good at providing moisture without making the skin oily or causing breakouts
this is perfect for putting on to keep my skin from being super oily
which can be oily
then becomes dry at times
doesn't make my skin more oily
it doesn't feel heavy or greasy
when first applied it feels a little heavy/ greasy to me
in the winter it gets dry
while it isn't greasy for me in the winter
i wouldn't recommended it for the summertime though because it way too light
i've read a bunch of reviews about how this product is too oily for oily skin
i've had a hard time finding a moisturizer that doesn't make me break out
so this does a good job of moisturizing without my face getting oily through the day
i still have to use a bit of matte primer on my t-zone help control oil
i found that after applying it i would have to use a blotting sheet so my skin would be shine free before applying make up
i would not repurchase again just because i can find a better moisturizer that wouldn't leave my skin shiny
i find my skin getting oily enough that i need to use my blotting sheets
i live in a very humid climate
in the winter dry air this oil is the way to go.
because there's still so much product left in the bottle
plus the algenist spf sublime defense day cream goes on so much nicer with this oil i didn't like it used under cream
my skin can get oily quick
doesn't leave the rest oily
my skin is not that dry any more.
honestly thought this oil would break me out as some super heavy moisturizers do or leave me with a grease slick
i honestly use a tiny bit of genius cream as i feel this helps it that i don't need nearly as much as i did with other heavier moisturizers that broke me out
it does look greasy at first
the only down side to it is that it seems to me to not be very moisturizing at all
it is not greasy at all.
this product works well in the summer for my dry skin
dry patches of skin at the same time
i suppose i'm a grass is greener on the other side kind of person
less wrinkly skin that i wake up with in the morning when i use it
i never feel greasy
he has very dry
he no longer has lizard dry skin
even though i am careful to gently press the oil on my face
it leaves a moisture barrier on your skin without being oily if that makes sense
even my aesthetician was concerned when i told her that i had purchased this oil because my clogged pores were that bad
s as they tend to dry
t doesn't feel oily
sometimes i wear just this
it actually prevents the occasional break outs i get
didn't leave my face shiny or oily
it did not feel greasy at all
or at least keeps the blemishes at bay if not providing the luminescence i deep down really want
i find it too oily for daytime use.
it doesn't seem to absorb quickly
i tend to break out pretty easily
moisturiser before i go to bed under the impression that it helps seal in whatever vital ingredients the serum/moisturiser has as i sleep
or whenever my skin needs a little more moisture
i usually don't wear other products when i apply this oil
especially during cold months it seems the skin can use the extra help
it lasts a very long time since 2-3 drops is enough to moisturize your face
i usually do not like the greasy way they feel on my skin or the fact that they don't really absorb all the way into my skin
doesn't leave skin greasy.
my skin normally is extremely dry due to wind
the down side was the fact that it was too oily for my skin which is normal/acne prone at 25
my only "problem" is that i've got 3 facial oils that can be used daily
now my skin is getting drier especially when it turns cold
she mentioned that this would combat my oily t-zone
so quickly to a once a day application of this amazing light oil
the thought of putting oil on your face when you have combination skin goes against nature
humid nyc weather it does not cause my skin to get extra oily or uncomfortable
there were dry patches of skin that i couldn't get rid of
people around me has commented how there's virtually no dryness anymore
even if its dry
a must try for dry skin.
the next day my skin is oily
look on my face , because come on, oil with oil?
just seemed too dry
so restorative i can't imagine my skin care routine without it
the oil is a good deal as you only have to use a tiny itsy amount of it
it does sink in very fast
you do not have to wait to apply your moisture cream
it actually reduces how oily my skin is in the t-zone
since i'm using this oil i feel my face smooth
i recently had a chemical peel that left my skin dry beyond belief
most of them tend to leave a residue
still leave a greasy feeling that never absorbs into the skin or they are just to heavy to begin with
my friend suggested i try a face oil because of my skin being so oily
telling me the whole thing about face oils make your face produce less oil because you're applying oil instead of just stripping it all the time
the immediately the next day my skin wasn't so slick
face serum a bit quicker than i would like
you should only be using 3-4 drops warmed in your h
this product didn't irritate my skin in any way
winter my skin gets much dries than in spring
s before applying anything with my fingertips on my face because i have the worst sensitive skin ever
if i stop using it my skin becomes dry
whatever may have oxidized is lightened to such a degree thats like they were always apart of your gorgeous face- a face that has an even skin tone
does not make me oily
put it on under makeup too for flawless application if you tend to be on the dry side
my skin is just that much more radiant that i would hate to hide it
it can fix any skin problem under the sun.
this helps my skin not dry out from them
when i don't use it i notice that my skin gets dull
your skin won't look 10 years older"
this stuff makes it so my moisturizer just completely seeps into my skin it seems super expensive
i can truly tell the difference in my skins moisture
this has taken care of the dry patches i used to get on occasion
have not had any dry patches on my combo skin since
my skin doesn't break out
it just was getting all the gunk out of my skin.
i slather a liberal amount of this all over my face
i basically use a clarisonic type device to wash my face at night
how my acne was pretty much not as swilled or red
nothing would take away my dryness
normally it takes about a week to heal to get rid of all of the uneven texture
since you constantly have to ope it germs can get in there
he normally doesn't even notice a new hair style!
other than evening out my skintone i haven't found it doing much
i don't get all oily midday like i would with so many other moisturizers
it's only for oily skin since it make your skin dry
of course it will dry out since it's just a serum
they will get dry
i apply it religiously as the first layer of my morning skin care regime
this serum does not make me oilier
it didn't dry my skin out as others have stated
i still have a very oily t-zone
my skin can still breath yet it helps to make my face much smoother
sunscreen was not heard of in the 70's so now i have sun damaged skin
if my face is oily as it tends to get by afternoon
if my face is looking dry
i always mist my face with a toner to allow me to use less of my costly skin products
when i have no makeup on my pores are smaller it's actually relle cool bc i was starting to think it was a lost cause
my skin doesn't look even close
it makes your skin look very smooth--you'd never know there were pores under your makeup
my make-up lasts much longer
does not make my face oily
it leaves your skin so silky that you almost don't need a primer
even the prescription stuff from a dermatologist didn't make me presentable or comfortable
enough moisture so that the drier areas of my combination skin are happy
literally so good i had some really dry patches
which isn't a bad thing for me since my skin can get dry
not dry at all
not overly oily either
i felt a different type of moisture locking into my face when i applied this day cream
especially anything with spf
gets really greasy looking by the end of the day
a single blot paper or throwing on some mineral powder usually take care of this
meaning that my t-zone is almost always pretty oily while other areas are sometimes dry
although my t-zone is very oily
the rest of my face can be a little dry
it gave my face such a healthy glow that i didn't think my skin was capable of having with out looking greasy
i never really use moisturizer before my make up because it tends to make my face greasier that it usually is
my only complaint is i feel it left my skin sort of greasy sometimes
it doesn't break out my sensitive combination skin
it is not greasy at all
i expected this to be heavy and greasy.
this is the first winter that my skin is not flaky or dry
it will heal any dry patches that i may have.
when you have oily skin
s not an oily look
i don't notice any flakiness through out the day
it does have a strong cucumber scent that dissipates during my wait time
i wish it came in a tube rather than a very heavy glass jar
this cream is heavy even though it is oil free.
my skin was not used to such rich moisture
this is great moisturizer where i live which is in very dry climate
it is not too oily and has spf 25.
i don't feel dry or oily/greasy after applying
the only thing that keeps this product from getting a 5 stars is when mix with a face primer or liquid foundation it flakes
he i don't get to oily through the day
doesn't cause excess oiliness is my t-zones yet helps to moisturize the areas that are dry or flakey
for oily skin try something different
highly recommend if you have dry skin.
don't be detoured this is an amazing cream for someone who has true dry skin
you actually feel a tug on your skin minutes after using it
when i put it on its not oily
my doesn't have anymore dry patches
i never really cared for an oil until my skin was getting really dry
it's a very light-weight oil that provides enough hydration without making my face look greasy
my skin does not look oily by the end of the day.
i let it soak in
unlike other foaming cleansers this one doesn't go all over the place when you rub it in which is a plus for me
it does not leave your skin dry
i still found my face to be oily
i hate using milky cleansers because i feel like my face is still dirty afterwards
i felt like i was wasting product- thin oil like texture that would run down my finger before i could apply it
you can pair it with pretty much any aye cream for extra care
i get dry all over
the shape of the little jar makes it difficult to get product out when it's on it's last legs
i carry this cleanser when i travel because it is all i need to wash away all my make up
you have to get the morning cream so that way it fixes any dryness that might be cause over night
t will feel a bit sticky if you use too much
i sort of like the burn
i love night time options because they tend to be more hydrating for my severely dry skin
like almost all other eye creams i have tried do
estee laudee is my go to for skin care
you use such a tiny amount it lasts forever!
not dried out or tight
it tends to your dry
make sure you use as a mask after you've cleansed
if you don't use a serum tho i have discovered that it makes your skin feel like rubber
is that it can really burn your eyes if you aren't careful during mascara removal
not have my eyes burn
a couple drops of water in your eye will completely heal it
doesn't dry out my face after cleansing
you only need a drop and you get tons of lather.
i don't like to use products that dry my face out as i am trying to beat wrinkles as well
it makes your skin firm yet smooth after each wash
makes sure my face is clean without the typical dry-out feeling that most cleansers give off
not in an unhealthy, dried out clean.
always left my skin dry afterwards
my skin really did look better even after just one wash
you only need a pea sized amount to lather up for your face
i didn't have to worry about my face drying up
my skin is normal with a mildly oily t-zone during the summer
becomes dry throughout in the winter
the weather is constantly dry here
my dry skin feels soooo soft when i rinse this away
you only need a little dab
it says on the tube that you can use it as a moisture mask twice a week
doesn't dry out skin or leave it oily
did cause some pore congestion n i notice extra oily-ness throughout the day
some times i'll use it during the day to add extra moisture to my skin if i'm feeling tired or dehydrated
it makes my skin look oily alone
s when they are having a really dry spell
and it does a lot for my cuticles too.
they made my face feel oily/greasy
just watch out to put not a lot on because it gets greasy quickly
doesn't make my hair ends look greasy
doesn't make me more oily
your worried about if it's going to be too heavy for you or leave stickiness
don't even bother using coconut oil on the face because that will cause you breakouts
have this as a morning moisturizer as well if you know that you have a dry texture matte foundation that your thinking twice about throwing out
helps me if my skins oily in the summer or super dry in the winter
i always get the small bottle
i never got oily or horrible
all i've ever read is that argan oil should not be deodorized
the regular formula was a bit too heavy for my skin
for someone who has really oily skin
not greasy at all
this oil goes on easily
i can even use it on my eyelids which is my most sensitive area
it seems whenever i use this product my skins tends to behave
my mascara seems to smear very easily when i put this around my eyes
it sort of sits on your face doesn't absorb into your skin initially
i wake up with skin that is not an oil slick-amazing
highly recommend to any oily skin people out there
i got this as a sample at sephora it moist my skins the first time i used it
i feel like it adds moisture where i need it without making the oily parts feel too heavy or cakey
it doesn't make my skin oily-er in the oily areas
doesn't leave your skin feeling like its got a film or stickiness
decided to go with the lighter version because i have oily
it was so oily i had to blot it
this oil is light enough
where the original oil is too oily for underneath makeup
it's light enough that i don't feel more pores are going to clog
it doesn't dry your skin or break out
i try not to apply it to my nose just cause i like to keep that area dry
it actually helps to keep my skin less oily throughout the day
never imagined an oil would work that well for oily skin
love this one just as much as the other josie maran argan oil
it does not leave me oily.
this oil i can use it on my face
way less oily feeling then the original argan oil
picked this up because my cheeks get really dry in the colder months
have not tried on my oily t-zone yet.
because i have oily skin
not oily at all
oils that never used to work for me are now my holy grail
made it less oily
when i use this oil
so your face doesn't have that greasy feeling since i have oily/combo skin
just be mindful that this might shorten the life of your color if you color your hair
this product was recommended to me after i totally clean my oily skin
it also keeps my hair in great shape after blow drying it in the morning
this doesn't aggravate my skin at all.
and it doesn't make me feel oily.
this stuff is great you can put it on your hair your nails
in your cream make up i specially use it for my anastasia cream contor kit it helps to prevent it's drying out
this light oil does it all!
not become oily, but actually sweat.
no matter how thick or thin the cream/gel was or how much i would apply my skin would just start sweating
and solved my horribly dry skin.
i like how quickly it is absorbed in my skin
it's so hard for me not to slather this all over my body
so the regular oil doesn't absorb well for me
foundation on my skin because if it has clogging properties
i often avoid using a moisturizer because i'm so afraid of breaking myself out
in the winter when my skin is feeling drier than normal i'd use a small amount of the dry parts of my face in the daytime
i like to use a drop or two on the ends of my hair if it's looking dry
it's light enough to absorb fairly quickly
not so quickly that you find yourself needing to incessantly reapply in order to feel like your skin is quenched
sometimes i used it to help get the last of my eye makeup off when my usual cleanser didn't quite get the job done
so the idea of using an oil as a moisturizer made no sense to me
although it doesn't make me less oily either
i really noticed that using the oil to combat my oils was clearing most of my face
this is by far the best oil i've used for my combination oily skin
it balances out my skin as well as any dry patches
don't be intimidated on putting beauty oils on your face even if you're oily
while making me less oily through the day
i usually get super greasy very quickly
since i have oily skin i got the light oil one
i can use this on its own more heavily or layer it lightly over a moisturizer for a one-two punch
your hair will be a bit greasy or oily in the morning from all the rubbing while you sleep
doesn't leave you looking greasy
thank goodness that they decided to make a light version of the argan oil for someone with sensitive skin
it actually soaks in faster than i thought
my usually oily skin was still dry
after using this on my combo to oily skin this has made my skin stay less oily than any other product has before
especially in winter when my skin tends to dry out
my skin is never dry when i use it.
not greasy at all
after using a lot of serums that tend to always leave my face oily or shiny
i feel like this stuff provides the same level of moisture
i generally use it as a night cream
doesn't really give a instant moisture to my skin
also something very hydrating because my face tends to dry out during fall
winter despite my oily t-zone
i don't seem to get dark spots as easily now either
does not dry out my face.
if i stop using it, my acne comes back.
plus you don't need to rinse it off either!
would not use this a regular cleanser as the residue left behind doesn't make my skin look or feel as clean as my regular water / product combination
after all it is basically mineral spirits for your face
the only beef that i have with this stuff is that the directions say there is no need to rinse before continuing on with your regimen
i currently use it as my first cleans in a double cleanse regimen because i find that it does leave residual stuff
lazy to wash my face
not only got me washing my face more
you don't wash it off
it doesn't dry my skin out
this really does the trick without stinging
water to make sure i got all the soap
find that i don't have the greasy
dry spots i used to have
not too oily nor too dry
sometimes in the summer i would cleanse my eyelids 3-4 times a day to keep oil at bay
doesn't leave me tight or red
it has the added bonus of not drying out your skin afterward
the best part is that it doesn't need to be rinsed off as i don't use water to wash my face
it's very good for winter use if you live in a dry climate with lower temperatures
it's not really a big problem for me because usually i cleanse my face again with a different cleanser after the first general wipe
not tight or greasy like the other two br
it's amazing what is leftover after you wash your face
i didn't find it sticky at all
i wouldn't reccomend using it to remove eyeliner or any make up too close to your eyes as it was very uncomfortable
it's perfect for sensitive skin or someone prone to breakouts or jut someone who wants to simplify their routine without losing any benefits
no sticky residue that you would expect from using a product rather than just washing with water
this is obviously getting pricey: eyemakeup wipe
not oily or dry like the different wipes ive used do
s of cleansing water as this it a little pricey too
i needed just a tad more to get my eye make-up off to feel clean
i used it after cleansing on days i'm going to do a treatment or just want my skin to be extra clean
it also doesn't dry out or irritate my sensitive skin
that might irritate your skin
i hate oil based removers because they irritate my eyes this takes off every single speck of waterproof makeup i have on my eyes
i am so happy i found this product because i was worried about causing wrinkles with all the rubbing i had to do to get my makeup off with other products
perfect for getting off that overnight grime when you don't feel like washing your face
doesn't feel heavy or slimy perfect to use at end of day or first thing in morning
refreshed without making it feel like there is a layer of gunk or chemicals on your skin even after letting it dry
plus it's so friendly to girls with sensitive skin like myself that it does not burn at all-it's literally like water
this just makes my skin care regimen so much faster
not oily nor dry
the cleansing water has never given me an issue
manages the oil that i even use it sometimes in the middle of the day on those oily areas
when my skin gets a little drier
i still use it after washing my face
did not burn my eyes like most make up removers
my way of testing how good they are is if my cotton pad comes clean after swiping with some caudalie cleansing water afterwards
it feels just like you're using water.
maybe because is made with water
i say this because it's not made with harmful chemicals
i can only find very oily eye make up remover.
my oily t-zone is less oily
yet still very gentle water out there
i love that i don't have to rinse it off
doesn't burn at all
this mask is my go to whenever i have dry patches
due to the price those of you with oily skin may not get the full benefits of a mask like this
not only does it nourish
sometimes more in the cold dry winter months
they could do damage if you scrub your face with this mask
i applied it on my not damp face the first time
low for something to combat my dry
it's my treat to my skin once a week
this product gets rid of my winter dullness
let your skin soak it right up
the sales associate told me that i should only use this mask when my skin is especially parched because it is so hydrating
i slathered it on my face not knowing it cost $140
i like the nourishing aspect of it since a lot of masks i have are "deep cleaning"
great for sensitive skin or after a day in the sun/wind
is quite sticky as expected
may need mixed occasionally if the oil separates out
it is rather sticky on your face
for winter months i dare say this is the most hydrating
putting raw honey on your face more that likely
won't get properly absorbed through your skin
i actually like this much better than just using honey or not even whipped honey
recommend it if you have dry skin
most amazing mask that will transform your skin to softness you didn't think was possible
as well as oily at times
it felt weird--that it didn't feel like it completely rinsed off when using only water
let whatever layer is left on the skin to remain
the texture was also great not sticky like i though it would be
totally worth it for dry/combination skin.
i'd advise people with oily skin not to use.
if i have really dry skin this fixes it immediately
this was the first moisturizer to really give me what i needed for oil control
my skin no longer has dry patches
would not recommend to someone with oily skin as it may be a bit too rich
doesn't leave my combination skin too oily
can look a bit greasy
the two other products were horrible for dry combo skin
this has always been so good to my dry-prone skin mainly because i live in a very arid climate
it would either make me break out non-stop or really leave my skin feeling drier than before
then constantly dry out
of you have dry skin or live in a colder climate
it got rid of my dry patches
would definitely recommend to anyone with extremely dry skin
someone at sephora recommended this one instead of the dramatically different gel that i find doesn't hydrate enough
i feel like if you have dry skin this would be good
my skin has been so dry in the cold lately
this is honestly one of the best products i have found for super dry skin that doesn't leave your skin with a weird heavy residue
most products just make my face oily
i do still use it when i come inside from the cold because the winter is harsh on my face
the moisture lasts all day without getting oily
one that also didn't make my skin feel dirty after cleansing
i prefer that over dry any day
everything else is desperately dry
i get dry skin on my face especially in the winter
almost daily just when i feel like i need a little moisture
good for those with dry skin
it didn't cause my skin to break out too.
providing the moisture into your face without making it greasy in the oily areas
i find it works best when you massage it into your face
when you rub it in
while it may be a tiny bit greasy when applied it sinks in super quikly
for the longest time i could not find a moisturizer that wasn't irritating to my skin
does not make your skin oily or sticky.
they were irritating my skin even more
as this can be a little greasy
my skin gets very dry in the fall/winter time so the lotion is perfect
i've always had really dry
it does not clog pores nor does it leave you oily
i get really dry in my forehead since i have used this moisturizer my forehead never gets dry
the only product that seems to work well with my dry skin in the winter without making my face feel sticky
it's not the best when i have extremely dry parched skin i need something way stronger
they either leave my skin feeling bad or irritate my skin
subtle oil that gets put back
however i only like it when i use it with a facial oil otherwise it has a tacky feeling on my skin
i recommend to everyone with dry skin to give this stuff a try
then i realized that 98% of the bad reviews are from people with oily skin
but that is probably because they have oily skin.
my skin drinks this stuff up in a good way
never oily with this product
as soon as i place it on my face my skin absorbs it
when my skin was super dry i would use it
i find that i always get puffy
this eye cream is good for early care
never used any eye cream before this
doesn't leave the eye area greasy
note that my face is usually very oily.
doesn't leave an oily finish
this is my new go to eye cream in the morning replacing clinique all about eyes™ rich
this cream, however, did the trick!
not only does it completely brighten the area
what i love about it is the fact that it dries up so fast
i feel that i need a bit more cream over it
this helps my skin not dry out either :
i want to feel greasy free
i would add a heavier spf if i were to be out in the sun all day
not need to cover up the rest of my skin
probably not good if you have oily skin
as i've never had luck finding a moisturizer that doesn't break me out
in the hot humid summer that's all i want
i don't need a heavy cream after all that other stuff
i find that i need a little more moisture
even though at first i didn't like how watery it feels
i might try something a little thicker for the colder months
let me start this by saying i have combination oily sensitive skin
gives all the moisture you need with a single pump
i feel like nothing can cleanse it off
if you put anything on this moisturizer before it's dries complety then it will would not work its magic
t's not very effective if your skin needs a lot of moisture like during colder weather
if my face feel particularly dry that day
is great for hot humid weather, it will be.
blends easily onto skin so you dont have to apply too much
it may make your skin appear shiny/oily for a few minutes after application
i do not feel any dryness during the day
since winter is here this is a little dry
some time when i put on spf lotion other than this one my nose flakes a little
it would be good if your skin is dry!
however i found that it left my skin a little greasy
does not leave me or oily or greasy
it doesn't take long to dry
afterwards your face doesn't feel like it has a film of residue on it
does not feel oily at all
doesn't cause break outs on my sensitive skin.
it's a light moisturizer so you may need something heavier for the winter if you have dry skin
no more greasy t-zone
it has done wonders for my skin-- i barely have dry patches anymore
it's also great that it doesn't make my face feel greasy since it absorbs so quickly
it doesn't absorb too well for my skin
i do feel the need to add a beauty oil for my cheeks
i do get a little greasy in my t-zone
gives me just enough moisture during the day
works even on my combination skin during our super dry
others dry out so quick
do not put it in an expensive purse or next to nice clothes
my skin tends to get dry in the winter
doesn't leave your skin greasy or parched either.
this moisturizer did not break me out even more
i don't know if it's this or the solid cleansing oil that i got that has been making my face glow
i feel it's good for adults who need nourishment for their skin to prevent the appearance of aging
please don't forget that drinking lots of water helps your skin a ton too
really haven't ever found a moisturizer that won't make my face a grease bucket in a couple of hours
doesn't feel oily or sticky
i find many product hard to absorb on my skin such as l'occitaine divine cream
ibuki cream works even better for dry winter condition
with this i don't mind it as much because it is so nourishing
best moisture i have ever used.
it has always been a struggle for me to find a moisturizer that tackled my dry/oily combo skin without making my t-zone feel heavy
i even noticed my face doesn't get oily as much
i only need to blot once and i'm good.
does not leave your skin looking oily
i like it cause i can get away with it without using my eye cream
again for dry skin
my t zone not at all greasy or oily
it doesn't burn or turn me red
for anyone with dry or sensitive skin i know fragrance is usually an issue
i need the softener because it takes away my flaky skin
needed a bit more moisture for winter.
this has been the only moisturizer that hasn't left my skin too dry or too greasy
it doesn't linger after you rub it in
doesn't leave you oily even during the day
you don't need to squeeze out a lot because just a pea sized amount goes a long way
it's a bit runny at times when it comes out of the bottle
usually too greasy or thick
doesn't leave you oily even during the day
chemical peels that all seemed to do more harm then good
normally a lot of products hydrate too much for me
great option for problem skin which is not oily
they either burned or dried her skin out!!!!
they do however, burn your face.
it doesn't dry out my face
since my skin is on the oilier side it has not over dried it out
i needed something mild
it didn't dry out my face
it stings a little when you put it on
i've noticed that my skin is less oily in my t-zone
it doesn't dry the rest of my skin out at all
press on the pad in the container to soak up just enough of the solution for one use
it does make your face tingle which is kind of annoying
most product dry out your skin
itches for the first couple times you use it
my skin does not feel dried out or raw from use
in the winter i have dry spells
i will forever use this product in my skin care routine
beware it really does feel super itchy when you use it
when you use to for the first to weeks your skin actually gets worse
adult acne that i highly suspect is caused by the fact that my skin doesn't turn over fast enough
salicylic acid does barely anything on its own
getting rid of any breakouts that make their way to the surface
there is a bit of a burn
they are very damp
i can't put any cosmetics on my skin without them being oil free as i break out the same day so even with the sting this has when applying it doesn't bother me one bit
yes, it does sting and burn.
the reviews on here are night misleading when they say that it is a burning/itching sensation
these pads really work.
it does burn- you may want to do a small patch test before applying it all over just in case it's too painful for your skin type
they keep my skin smooth until i get home
yeah it does burn/itch right away
it does sting a bit when you first wipe it on
i found that applying it directly to my skin as too irritating
the burning sensation is so bad everytime i use it i tear up
they really clear up your acne very well
the pads don't dry you out
these wipes are so easy to use.
don't let your skin get dry.
i'd say if you have mild to moderate acne i'd use these for a few weeks as a quick fix to clear things up then ditch them for something a little more gentle
but you should know it burns.
return something that burns so badly
ready to go so that i could immediately sooth my skin from the pads
so this product loses a star because it really is almost painful to use these pads
have a fan ready to cool your face
as they totally remove all the icky oil from my face
you gotta' feel the burn to get the benefits
imagine ditching your foundation because your skin looks that good
they cleanse all the dirt that might be sitting in your pores
doesn't dry my skin.
they don't dry out my face
got rid of all of the gunk that was deep in my skin i couldn't squeeze out
this does itch a little bit when i first put it on
my skin has not dried out at all
rarely do i rate stuff on spear
don't let the skin totally dry
they did start to dry my skin out even using just once a day
oil in your face
it doesn't dry out my face
doesn't turn me into a dry flaky mess
which i always wash first
because of these pads my skin is completely under control
the body towels are so expensive for so few
tell you that $5 oxy pads are the same thing
this stuff makes my face itch!
be sure to put your eye cream on first because if you touch these pads then touch your eye it won't be fun
these pads take care of zits like nothing i have come across
ointment they could throw at me
the pads do sting a lot right after you use them
so for the amount of pads you get
sure they sting a little i just fan my face until the burning subsides
it doesn't dry my skin out too bad either
the pads do burn but it is worth it.
i do cut the pads in half since they are so saturated
though if you apply moisturizer quickly it's not bad at all
a little drying, but not too much.
there's a purging period where your skin gets worse before it gets much better
i feel like my old pimples are drying up without more replacing them
it doesn't seem to dry out my skin either like some strong products can
not too drying which is good
yes these are tingly for the first few days you use them
your skin gets used to it
i wish he made a jar with 100 pads!
you need literally a pencil's eraser amount for your whole face
you only need a very tiny amount to wash your face
have you ever have that icky feeling when you're face has a layer of oil whether it's on your t zone or throughout your face
will clean off all the oil
or on it's own on a day when my skin feels particularly dry
i found the gel too sticky for my liking
when you wake up your face will be "dewy"
this stuff works miracle if you leave it on overnight after a thorough face cleansing
it will make the skin hurt a little if the skin is too dry
it does do its job perfectly that it restores moisture levels without any breakouts
in fact it is a pick me me up for dehydrated skin
you can wash it off after 20 min
the less product there is to wipe off
that's a great way to see how dehydrated your skin may be
it's not easy to find masks for dry skin so when i saw this product
i even used it around my eye area after an especially drying business trip
anything higher can actually dry your skin out
you only use a little each time so a tub last a pretty long time
i've also noticed that my night serums seem more effective because of the type of moisture this leaves in my skin
i find that this process doesn’t strip my skin or dry it out excessively
it’s usually very difficult to find a cleanser that removes everything without drying me out too much
however i use it in the shower
let some hot water in the jar
soft yet not dried out
a smelly risk i'm more than willing to take on the daily because it melts makeup away like a dream
if i use anything foamy
it takes so much time to massage my face entirely
i know such trouble causes for a in home facial clean is a thing that people tends to avoid
which either leave me skin greasy or residual makeup
didn't think it cleansed my face all that well
it spreads easily once it's warmed by your body temperature so you really only need to use a tiny bit
you don't need to worry about keeping the muslin cloth clean
it's does not burn or irritate the eyes!
it doesn't dry you out like a lot of cleansers do
it doesn't linger on the skin once you rinse it
you automatically feel refreshed right after you wash your face
if you alternate cleansers or feel like your skin goes through certain transformations throughout the year
i would not use this if you have oily skin
as i am getting older my skin seems to be getting more dry
when you rub this cleanser all over your face it really seems to get into the pores depending on how long you rub
the greasy texture may put some people off.
get it all dry
do the cloth thing for three times
i love the fact that i can use it on my eyes without stinging
as i've gotten older it's a bit drier
most products that would treat my congested skin are very drying
there's a little insert that comes in the box explaining how to properly massage your face
my skin isn't flaking at all anymore
because you can rub it right into eyes without any burning
she refused to use it because she assumed the oily texture would make her face oily
it turns out i had dry skin
i am no longer oily
not drying at all
i love how it feels after cleansing my face with their hot cloth
but i would not recommend to super oily skin.
before using it i recommend you look up oil cleansing method otherwise you may be disappointed with no lather
seemed to improve the dry areas without making the oily parts break out
it is definitely a little drying
it goes against my instinct to wet the face with water
even though i didn't out the cleansing balm on my eyes
it did not dry out my skin over is it better than a 40 or 30 dollar cleaner?
it dries nice the next morning its either dried out or smaller
i like the way it dries little spots
it didn't dry my skin out either.
so with that comes a bit of dryness
it balanced it nicely without being too dry
their deep cleansing mask did nothing for my breakouts
your face has that frozen look
be careful to only use a little because when you close the lid a little eeks out
you rub between your fingers to warm it up then apply
nor does it dry my skin out
you'll never have dry patches again
once it's on my skin i barely notice it
it means your face has been stripped of all oils
not that you are squeaky clean
i no longer have scaley dry skin on my face.
note: i have dry/sensitive skin that gets super dry during the winter
i apply a small amount before i get into the shower
it isn't drying at all
not as thick to apply
really work it into my skin to gently clear away the night cream
doesn't feel dry or stripped
not perfumey like some skin care products can be
it's a bit lighter for am face washing when you don't have make up removal needed
it doesn't dry my skin
am prone to having dry patches that burn
then i rinse it off before i get out of the shower
doesn't leave my combination skin oily at all
the smell seems less intense each time i use it
massage into dry skin for as long as you'd like
comes off easily with water that you don't need to wash your face w soap
you warm it in your h
so they only reason i even tried this face wash because reviews were mad it didnt foam
which tends to be normal to dry most of the time
as it can dry out my skin
you might get a bit of drying at first as the vitamin a
no need to add another layer of product on regular sun days
if i use just a tad too much a thick film is left behind that creates little balls when i rub my skin
doesn't cause me to break out or get red due to sensitivity
plus it doesn't irritate my skin
not too slippery or too thick
whereas other creams would still leave my skin dry after a wash
real oily over here
retinol should not be used during the day when you get sun exposure
you may experience a few dry patches when you start back up again
my skin is often messed up due to different climates
it is light weight enough that i don't wake up still feeling like i have a heavy lotion on my face
i live in a very dry climate
i absolutely hate most moisturizers because they never seem to soak into my skin
it is the right weight and does absorb quickly.
this is the only retinol-derivative that i've tried that doesn't make my skin react horribly
real oily over here
retinol should not be used during the day when you get sun exposure
you may experience a few dry patches when you start back up again
supple skin which will make you look like you did actually get 8 hours of sleep
it does not irritate my skin
not so much dry skin- this is your jam
you only need the slightest pressure to pump out the tiniest amount
so you will need one of those two if you have dryness around your eyes
wait for it to totally dry
immediately got rid of the dry flakiness
love that i have found a retinol for my eye area that my body won't reject
although it did tingle a little once i applied this product
i don't find it to be too drying or too strong.
it does slightly tingle upon application every once in a while
it doesn't even make my eyes water
does the burning go away with regular use?
i don't think this serum will provide me with the amount of moisture that i prefer at night
anyone seeking a non-irritating eye cream with a decent level of sun protection needs to try this one
you can only apply one layer
however it can crease if it's used too heavily
i like to put two layers of eye cream on because my skin is so dry
it doesn't ball up or pill when i layer items over it
i do not find that it leaves a white cast at all
helps them not be so dry
it sometimes it starts flaking under my make-up
even though almost everything with spf usually does
i feel like they drag along my skin
i don't know if there is even another spf eye cream on the market
nor burn or sting
i only use this in the morning because i read it's good for puffiness
it doesn't leave my under-eye area looking too shiny the way murad did
if you are new to using sunscreen within the sensitive area of the eyes then you must consider it is best to "dab" the moisture
i̇f your skin is dry give it a chance
just don't expect your dark spots to magically disappear overnight from using this product
i only use a bottle beginning of each year when i feel like winter has made my skin dull
tried a bunch of products to lighten it
i will not buy it again though as i feel that it is kind of useless to put it under my tinted moisturizer
not dry or stripped
have to make sure to up my spf under my makeup or i feel a little bite when the sun comes out
i only use it at night because it makes my skin appear a tad greasy
my skin: sun damage to my t-zone which also happens to be oily
once applied you do not see any of the glitter on your face because the particles are very small
it does not dry my skin or make it oily.
don't think that just because you are medium skin toned you need the medium
there's no way to open the container
its' going to look a little silly on you because it will give you reddish pigmentation
since my dad's from sicily i don't need anymore red undertones in my skin
if you wash your skin
i find it to be too heavy for my skin
even immediately after application your skin looks better
somehow, my face isn't near as oily either.
bone up on your sunscreen as it doesn't come equipped with any
it does not clog my pores which i have a problem with usually
glowing when i wake up which would never happen with any traditional drying acne products
it feels so good to slather onto a clean face at night time
don't make your skin oily
i like this night cream because it is rich
it goes on a little "greasy"
my skin still feels oily even after washing it off
i try not to put too much on the areas of my face that tend to get oilier
doesn't feel heavy once on
a nice, rich night cream without being too heavy.
my face is very dry (winter and summer).
it does not dry or irritate my skin.
i agree with some of the reviews that this is not a cleanser for those with dry skin
it gets my skin really clean without drying it out
it takes off make-up exceptionally well without over drying
it does feel a litle drying after washing
dry in the winter
i love this wash for my sensitive
this product helps clear my t-zone without drying my cheeks out two much
would leave it too oily
i might not use it through the hot sticky months of the summer
it's like giving your skina big glass of water
or dry/fickle skin
from the moment you mix the wonderful cream with water
neither drying or greasy.
won't go back to any other cleansers--it makes my skin soft
super dry skin that gets oily during the day.
this cleanser has done wonders for my skin by noramalizing the texture as well as getting rid of the dark spots
it isn't easily washed out
you need to use warm water and care of it.
it's very concentrated---so you need very little---like the size of your fingernail---literally
good cleaning action and not too drying.
you get a large bottle of this stuff
had perfect skin even through the stress
the blackheads were so tiny it's not like i could squeeze them out either
my skin was not dried out
the toner is also wonderful although it can irritate ur eyes a bit
i definitely recommend if you have dry skin.
i really feel like i get a deep cleansing whenever i use it
doesn't leave your face dried out
definitely recommend to anyone looking to restore moisture
not too dying, and not too oily.
the best part is that you only need a little bit to cleanse your face
while never ever drying
it does not dry my face out nor does it leave it greasy
this can be used to wash your face in the morning since your face is more or less already clean
this wash is great if you have combination/dry skin
you feel clean and no dryness at all.
i would have dry patches
it doesn't really exfoliate as much as you may think
it doesn't sting at all
just another tip: if you haven't tried a tool similar to the clarisonic scrubbing brush
most i have tried leave me skin tight
i wold walk over hot coals for this one
every time you wash with it
it doesn't dry it out or leave it oily.
i tend to wash my face then apply it
especially in the summer so refreshing to your skin
i absolutely love this mask for when i've gotten a little too much sun or had a few too many drinks the night before
you can really feel it clean out your pores.
when dry it is so lightweight
everything i've tried for preventing breakouts is either too drying
i tend to have red cheeks no matter how much moisturizer or serum i use that are supposed to clear them up
don't wash it off
if you are one with combination to dry skin buy this i promise you'll not need another moisturizer or face mask
i am sure of how this product applies a bit sticky while applying it
if you just need a hydrated look from dry or patchy skin give it a night
i am sure it would be a dream for a sunburn as well
very oily in others
this mask did not irritate my skin
i saw this mask in sephora one day while searching for a mask that would hydrate my extremely dry
i tend to sleep with it on as a treatment.
great for making my eyes feel less puffy if i didn't sleep well
my face was so dry
perfect amount of moisture for what i needed too.
and it does not irritate the skin.
non-greasy at all
in comparison to another's "overrated" products that make skin break-out or with patches
s down the most refreshing mask if you are sun burned
it is even more softer when i chill the mask in the refrigerator
the fact that it makes the redness go away much faster
you can apply a thick layer let it sit for awhile then rinse or use it like a moisturizer before bed
i often get patchy dry areas when the weather changes
it definitely helps calm your face right after using a stronger mask like the moor mud or the pumpkin one
i keep it in the refrigerator for the extra coolness
for the people who think this product burns your skin
it's probably because your skin is so parched that when you get moisture on it
it'll feel like burning
cucumber are supposed to help cool your skin
if you're washing this off its a waste.
mind you i totally just expected it help with dryness a little
my skin stays free from dryness for days after use
my only complaint is this mask tickles my face in an annoying way when it's drying
since it tends to dry out my skin so much
fear not because now you can leave the bathroom without a blotchy red face
it can also be pretty drying in the winter.
i do my normal skin care routine
i tend to get a dull complexion a little more quickly than others- this is awesome after exfoliation at night to fight that as well
i found another reason to love it when i put it on my chapped nose after a cold
my skin gets really dry during winter especially around my nose
it would feel so good if worn when it's 95 degrees out
will help even out blotchiness in the long run
i instantly fell in love with the cooling sensation you immediately feel as you apply it to your face
my only negative to it is that when you rinse it off
you can't just wash it off quickly.
i'd like to not have to spend as much time rinsing it off as i do putting it on
this stuff really makes my skin feel much better after it gets dry from the shower
like jelly or something
i cannot give this product five stars because it says that it detoxes my face
while it looks less greasy on my t zone i still have blackheads
i didn't get the cooling feeling
generally my face is very dry
this is one of the only products that reduces my dryness without breaking me out or exasperating my oiliness
to make it even better put it in the freezer for a little bit or just keep it in the fridge
does not make my skin greasy
i actually keep it in the refrigerator
not to the point of where my eyes will get too oily
it locked in much needed moisture
this is strong enough to clean without irritating my dry spots
sometimes need a little extra to get stubborn mascara off
gentle enough for the dry areas
which makes my face super oily as it tries to compensate for the loss of moisture
it doesn't dry out skin like other cleansers sometimes do
it takes a little getting used to not adding water
you are left with soft skin that never feels dried out
sometimes i wet my fingertips a little bit because it can dry out a little before i'm ready to wash it off
especially when i'm in humid climate
it was a hassle to get use to using it dry
i rub it in before i get in the shower
my face never feels oily or greasy after i use it either
does not over dry my skin or make me break out
i knew deep down i was doing more harm to my dry skin than good
its amazing at taking off water proof makeup if you just take your time with it
does not make my skin oily
does not dry out my skin
usually 2-3 pumps are enough for me
not tight or dry
does not dry it out
you put it on when your face is dry which seems unusual
i find 3-4 pumps can get all my makeup off
does not foam for those of you who prefer ones that foam
it does not make my skin feel dry after using it.
my skin is really dry in the winter
a bit on the oily side in the warm weather
not dry, tight, or any leftover residue.
it doesn't make you dry or feel stripped
doesn't dry out my skin
does not dry the face out too much if you have sensitive dry skin like me
i really only ever used water to wash my face
it can even be used in your hair.
good for moisture but not for extreme dryness.
the greatest thing about this product is that it does fade my dark spots that i had from acne
i do dampen my skin
which can really dry out my skin
if i have too much out i just put it on my hair ends
my skin gets really really dry during winter time
was given this as a sample in the store one day while shopping for moisturizer that wouldn't make my makeup all damp
especially if you have dry skin
i live in a really dry
you will be left with absolutely no oily residue
sometimes a little dry in areas sometimes a little oily
it is just the right amount of moisture to make my face feel great
i didn't want to risk making my skin too oily.
i saw that everyone was using oils
it is not greasy
then it is less sticky
it doesn't make your skin feel oily at all.
it is not greasy
after i went in to find something a little stronger to help with winter dryness
i even mix it with some foundations that i find too dry
let it absorb into the skin very well before primer
not greasy at all
still does not make my face look greasy
my previous breakouts from the too rich cream i used before are gone
flaky skin doesn't break out from it
love how this oil absorbs so much more quickly than other oils i have tried
this oil is not greasy
hope that will help the dry patching.
i must say this is the best oil for my dry combo skin especially in the winter time
has treated some of my recent dry areas of my face due to the cold dry weather this season
it did not leave my skin feeling oily or greasy as i would have expected
i like this oil...a lot.
this one didn't dry out my face.
it would be way too oily for me
as someone with an oily t-zone
this saved my skin when it was really dry
make it possible for me to just make facial expression without feeling like my skin will rip
it was hard finding a type of lotion i could put on my face before bedtime
i don't have an oily t zone or flaky skin i don't need to use that super exfoliant anymore
great in the winter on dry
never oily for combination skin type
whenever i'm having a bad skin day
this will get you through the winter or super dry days
occasionally when my face is dyer than usual
others can leave me very greasy or not hydrating my dry patches at all
it completely cured my dryness without feeling too heavy
i find that i wake up with a more even skintone.
winter weather makes it worse
i got a sample of this from a sephora employee who recommended it for my dry/normal sensitive skin
it was as if my skin was dry yet oily
some until it clears up naturally
after applying it the product doesn't completely get absorb
it is great for a dry face.
my face felt like i just applied this cream
moisturizers either didn't do anything for my dry skin or it would make my skin oily
i always have dry patches that peek out through my makeup no matter what i use
flawlessly that i almost can't wait to wash my face
usually go oil-free
those tend to not give me enough moisture in certain area
it's also a beautiful moisture base before i do my makeup
it comes with a small metal tube-wringer that helps you to get the the product out without too much waste
the next morning i don't have any flakiness or any excess oil
it's really smooth after you apply the cream
i put on my normal skin care
it is kind of sticky initially
i put it all over my face when it is really dry
i also use it when i just have a dry patch
i can even put it on my lips
i suggest you keep a tube of this in your cupboard at all times
this one has never made me break out which is perfect since my skin dries out terribly in the winter
it can leave an oily residue so use a very small amount or it's impossible to put makeup over it
it doesn't break me out or feel greasy works well with my oils
with this moisturizer i don't have to reply throughout the day or worry about flaky skin
if you struggle with dry flaky skin
suffer from really dry
if you need a major moisture boost for your skin
i also love the you get a little tube-squeezer to get every last bit out
it doesn't burn on application
i've had such a problem with dry skin this winter
spend almost 50$ for your most precious skin
our winters are extremely dry
this stuff is the last layer in my routine
finding a moisturizer that doesn't break me out is incredibly difficult
i will say it does leave a luminous finish on my skin
together they leave my skin soft
best for dry skin esp in winter.
my face is no longer constantly dry
i still use it daily because i love how quickly it absorbs into my skin while being extremely hydrating
very good product for anyone with dry skin
it is indeed oil and cream, but it is not oilly.
t can absorb by your skin really quick
useful to the people who wash their face every day by really warm water
even with an oily t-zone my cheeks get so dry
i've always had issues with day creams because i have very dry skin
i pair this with the liquid as well since i'm so dry
i mean that i've yet to meet a person who's skin flakes faster than mine
dry skin that can get oily
i pat it in until it's fully absorbed
making it look even more greasy
not too heavy for humid summers
my skin is either too dry or red or too oily
i tried this because my skin was so dry
i like the fact that there is a metal applicator so that the chances of getting bacteria in the product is reduced
my sensitive skin did not break out
money trying to find the perfect moisturizer that wouldn't break me out
i've always had a difficult time finding a moisturizer that kept my skin feeling good all through the day
i live in a very dry climate with harsh winters
yet effective at helping my skin hold onto what little moisture it has
i could get away with not moisturizing that frequently because my skin was super oily
the highest praise i can give is it does not irritate my dry sensitive skin
it does not irritate my skin at all or leave it red
it doesn't leave me oily like the bobbi brown does
doesn't leave me oily looking
t does not leave your skin with a sticky feeling
does not oil up my face
perfect texture to keep my face free of extra oil that can trigger acne for me
on any given day can be a grease pit
have dry flaky skin at the same time
i recommend this to anyone with dry skin.
doesn't linger for long
in the winter months i would rub the excess on my h
which usually happens to me whenever it's cold
it might feel thick at first
jart's ceramidin cream has eliminated the flaky skin that i am supposed to be getting by starting renova
it would also work well as something to dab on dry spots
makes oily t zone moisturized without making you look oily
winter my skin gets quite dry from extremely cold outdoor weather in mi
my skin did not feel dry
it's even more awesome if you use it in conjunction with ceramidin liquid
did say that this wasn't enough for her super dry skin
i moved from a humid climate to a dry/cold/bipolar/what?
everyone who i've forced to try it agrees that it has an extremely pleasant hydrating sensation when it's first applied
any time when my skin starts to feel irritated or sensitive from trying new products
it did lightly break me out on my oily forehead if i apply too heavily
doesn't irritate my skin or cause breakouts which is a safe haven for me
those don't seem to be doing the job or helping my dry sensitive skin
my skin gets really tight after i use any cleanser so having this serum during the winter months has been awesome
it really is like a drink of water for your face
i need the moisture boost as it gets cold
great for people with dry skin
skin type you have
i tried everything to get my skin to the point that i could wear my tinted foundation without having to put more lotion on to quench the dry patches
i got a sample of the cermadin cream which i use over the liquid on places where my face is really dry
so be careful when you squeeze it out
they're the only ones that combat dryness
my face would always get so dry
my makeup would always look so flaky by the end of the day
it balanced my dry skin without making it oily
my skin is the driest thing ever
it's just not good in the warmer weather for me or i was just too dry/dehydrated
she came up with this due to my skin not working well with sun screen in my foundation nor moisturizer
i recommend trying this out for people with dry skin yet have oily areas
this product went smoothly on my face yes it's a little bit sticky once it dried out
once it gets cooler
even pricey products would make my skin break out
you could mix in a drop with your eye cream or lip balm
i smetimes rub on a few drops after using a product that i know is drying
it gives me some added moisture
apply it to my damp face
t can be great for dry or sensitive skin
no matter how mild winters are
i will occasionally add a drop of nude oil into the liquid before i apply if my skin feels tight
the more moisture your skin gets the better
my skin has been so dry this winter
only temporarily because my dry patches tend to return
extremely dry with a constant layer of excessive oil later in the day
the cold weather my skin has been flaking off
this stuff within a day or two saved my dry disgusting skin
the product leaves my skin moist even during the worst dry winter days as the heat blows throughout the day
i kind of dig the basic clean packaging too.
i really struggle keeping the moisture in
can't describe my feelings for this ceramidin liquid
it relieved my itchy skin last winter better than anything i've used
if your skin is oily/combo like mine
over the summer months i tried something else because i never loved the powdery scent this has
this is what i felt when i needed some savior for my burning red skin
although sometimes i feel like i don't even need to moisturize after this
which can get very dry
i can hands down say this is liquid magic!
completely got rid of my dry patchy skin i had
makeup goes on way smoother now, oh and not oily!
this might be irritating to sensitive skin because it has a lot of alcohol
i like the liquid because i can use 4-5 drops on my face
it boots their moisture power when it isn't quite enough
the thing i like about this liquid is that it isn't sticky or slick
not one dry patch.
even in very cold
this formula gets kind of lost in the moisture
this serum works well enough that i don't feel the need to use the ceramidin cream with it
saved it for wintertime when i get dry
slightly tacky until fully dry
i put it on dry skin
it's a thick liquid that leaves your skin feeling a bit tacky which i actually love
my dry skin is better than ever
it's light enough to use on your body or your face
as well as dry
i am terrified of putting anything other than water on my skin because it is so sensitive
they make the rest of my face totally parched
this is the only thing i've found that helps with dry patches
so finding products that work without irritation or dryness is a real challenge for me
considering you only need 3-4 drops of this serum to make your face feel amazing
i just had to try it for my dry skin
the first thing i noticed about this serum is that it's very liquidy- almost like water
i'll take all the moisture i can get
i sometimes like to add some moisturizer on top of my makeup later in the day if my skin is really dry
my skin would be dry
i would like to try the cream next for our brutal canadian winters
this is a miracle in a bottle for those of us with dry skin
dry on the rest
it goes on after your toner or any treatment with requires you to use a cotton pad
i like the fact that it is liquid
and the anti aging never hurts either!
it is never oily
i like the way my face looks after using this cream
unfortunately many creams dry out my skin or irritate it
the product is dispensed in this squeeze canister that i prefer to a jar where i have to scoop out what i use daily
but now, it is smooth when i touch it.
i like this product its not greasy going on
the only thing i didn't care for was it left my skin feeling a little greasy towards the end of a hot summer day working in the sun
all you need it a half pea size amount to lather across your whole face
on the down side i feel like it dries a little sticky
it was dry and then oily and then dry again.
combo-oily dry--also breaks out from time to time
i only use a pea size amount as it lathers really really well
it doesn't irritate my skin whatsoever
this tube lasts a long time too
the only little problem i had is that it doesn't efficiently remove all of the mascara i use
i feel that immediately after drying my face
i love how this face wash is great for sensitive skin
during the winter my skin got even drier especially that clarisonic did quite a damage to my skin
i wanted something gentle after i'd use my tatcha camelia oil to get rid of make up that is usually set deeper within skin
the rice enzyme powder thing by tatcha were the only things that didn't break me out
goes a long way doesn't leave my skin dry
doesn't dry my skin out
if you wear heavy amounts of make up
it makes my skin squeaky clean but not drying
this tends to make me feel a tiny bit dry
it does dry my skin out a bit
i didn't want to go back to the blue line of skincare products since my face didn't feel as oily as it used to be
trying to find a good cleanser that would not upset my super sensitive skin
the downside is it does feel like it leaves a thin film on your skin right when you wash it
looks great without makeup in the summer heat
with a lil bit of water it foams up so much
which made things worse because they were drying
plus, it doesn't dry me out.
not tight or flaky at all
gentle enough on your face
only face wash that actually clears me up without making me drier than the sahara
not dry or tight at all
thru that struggle i've had a hard time finding a facewash that will help me with my acne
i can't say that it really cleaned up any of my skin issues or moisturized at all
did not leave my skin red or irritated
is enough to wash your face with.
eat it to with both
i feel like i get a thorough wash without having a tight
i did knock off a star only because it is a bit drying for my skin
good moisture all night long
it lasts forever because you can use literally such a tiny amount
but this one really works for my oily skin.
if i kept the cleanser on for too long
i would feel a little bit dry
so i always rinse if off on time.
the rich later makes washing my face more satisfying than just regular soap
doesn't dry you out
it lathers really well so you only need the tiniest bit
t was a bit too drying for me
in previous review somebody mentioned its hard to rinse off
yes its difficult to rinse it off when you use too much
i just use a very small amount which is enough for making rich lather
a little goes a long way it lathers up considerably so you don't have to use much
especially didn't irritate it
as soon as i apply a dime sized amount of this to my skin it totally calms down totally
my face has no more dryness like it did
the reasoning i'm giving it 4 stars is because it doesn't help with my acne like other face washes have
it's help with my oily skin
doesn't dry out my skin
it doesn't dry my skin
only down fall u will need boscia blotting papers because it will make ur skin a little oily small price to pay for flawless younger looking skin
i must say that it is great to have a cleanser that doesn't make your face feel tight or peel
it feels sooo nice when you wash your face with it using the clarisonic
returned it not wanting to risk it with the scent however i then bought the first aid beauty gentle milk cleanser or whatever it's called
the wash was doing nothing good for my skin
because my skin is very dry from the cold
when i put the softener on its feels much better
is less oily by the end of the day than usual
my skin usually feels dry at night
without being too light or too heavy
dry to very dry skin for day
it doesn't leave a greasy finish
especially if you live somewhere with a harsh winter
good for days when i don't feel as dry
it also doesn't make my skin greasy which is a huge perk to me
getting dry patches despite being oily
i would say if you're using a lot of acne treatments that dry out your skin
it wasn't oily or greasy.
i tend to have dry skin in the fall/winter
i do feel like this has helped to provide moisture without causing me to breakout more
i also love that it doesn't stink like most sensitive lotions do
not oily or dry
i feel this oily is not making you feel truly oily
this, you still feel your skin can breath.
i get very dry skin in the winter
my skin doesn't get especially dry
not making me oily
i can't use those drying products anymore
i've always been afraid of moisture
felt that i could have even more moisture
i deal with less humidity
this cream is not too heavy for daily use
i live in a very dry climate
as we move into the colder months it gets even dryer
i would highly recomment this for those battling dry skin
put too much it does get greasy
i switch to the lotion version as it can be tad heavy for summer
tends to break out more
there's a learning curve as to how much to use during the day if you have oily skin
it took me some time to figure out the correct amount to use during the day so that it doesn't feel too heavy or look greasy under my makeup
ive read some reviews saying how this products makes their skin "sticky"
doesn't feel heavy on your face
it doe not make my face feel greasy at all.
especially if you're using acne products that tend to dry your face out
i would recommend letting this moisturizer sink into your skin for a couple of minutes before applying foundation though
flaky in some spots which drives me super crazy cause i can't find a product that will moisturize my skin
take care of the flaky patches without being greasy everywhere else
like not thick feeling at all
-this has balanced the moisture all through out my face-non greasy
absorbs fast and dont feel oily at all.
they would only cause the irritated areas to burn without helping the dryness at all
in the summer time my skin gets really oily
the rest of my face is usually extremely dry
i wasn't too dry or too oily
it gets oilier because it overcompensates for the dry weather
i would recommend this to anyone--dry skin
you only need so little to moisture your entire face
the only down side is the smell of the cream make me feel like
oily so most cause me to break out
was not at all greasy
it made my face so so so oily.
since it's enriched/thicker it would not leave my face oily
i see this container lasting quite awhile
i tried this on a whim because my skin was dry flaky
even though i have oily skin
i feel that it might work well with dry skin too
it seems like it would be thick or heavy when you first touch it
for the first time i have experienced severe dry skin from winter weather
it does what it says without the oily feeling in the morning
i usually have oily/combination skin
winter has made it super dry
the consistency is actually thick which i like
once you apply it onto your face
not at all greasy
i like how it just absorbs in to your skin
i like it better the the skin care line.
it doesn't leave your face oily
is less oily by the end of the day than usual
tends to get dry in the winter
am not sure that this would be good for oily skin
i am 66 and have normal to dry skin.
however this winter weather has made my skin really dry
'm trying to find things that are hydrating without being greasy
greasy for day use
it is the best thing i've found for my dry skin
it is too thick or feels greasy if you have oily ot combo skin
they have dried out or irritated my skin
i stored it away to use in case i run out of moisturizer
just don't get it into the eye as it'll sting
this cream does not make my skin oily
the most i have ever hoped for is that an eye cream keep my under eye moisturized
almost like cold cream
does not ever get too thick or cause milia
t just maybe this is a lighter texture than i am used to
a lot of eye creams unfortunately break me out
it has this amazing cooling affect when you put it under your eyes
on days when i don't want to wear make up i am not needing to cover my dark circles with concealer because they look nothing like before
do not get too close to the bottom lashline as it's very rich
this is actually a very light/easy-to-apply eye cream
also has helped with getting rid of any dryness i had as well from the insanely freezing mn winter we are having
usually end up tearing which for me causes more wrinkles as i wipe them away
it has only been a few days- seems to help my skin smooth out before i apply my moisture
i love how each pump breaks a pearl open which keeps it so fresh
the texture is a bit thicker so the products will last for quite some time
i do like this eye cream: it sinks in immediately
it still seems to disappear too quick
you only need a small bit to moisturize your whole face
i would imagine it would not work well on oily skin due to the consistency of the cream
i need to swap out my face cream for something that better hydrates without breaking my skin out
this is the first moisture-infusing product i've come across that didn't break my skin out in little bumps
wouldn't recommend it to very oily skin
moisturizers rarely rate more than a yawn from me
it made my face feel super soft without having to apply too much
due to the colder weather
they were all either too greasy
wait for it to soak it up
i only get a little oily in my t zone during the day so this oil is perfect for me
i don't think i'll be going back to my previous eye creams
i don't think i'll use this on my entire face since the level of hydration it provides is a bit much for my habitually oily areas
yes it can be oily
all the reviews about the easy-to-spill bottle almost made me not buy this
all you need to do is mist your skin with water
much more dry in winter
i love that origins tries to stay away from all the harmful chemicals
who makes a bottle full of oil so easy to spill???
leaves you with a soft glow that i just can't get enough of
this face oil is not bad.
it doesnt take long to dry
this oil even helped me survive a frigid winter trip to tokyo with lots of outdoor exposure
then i have to combat the wind burnt look with other junk
doesn't slide off your face like some moisturizers will do
i can tell that the skin on my forehead
my face really dries out during the winter months
it really does a good job locking in moisture
i think the problem was it was not moisturizing enough for me
let it soak in for a few minutes then put on moisturizer
if it gets too dry, i just add a splash of water.
i don't have any issues with it drying out
he skin look dry
after about 3 weeks use my skin doesn't feel tight or flaky anymore
my skin also tends to get pretty oily mid-day
and not in a greasy kind of way.
until this had to choose between being clean or having moisture
you barely use any cause it is a thicker lotion so a little goes a very long way
they seem to dry out my undereye area as well
this is the only eye cream that didn't irritate me
this is one of the very few eye creams on the market that don't cause my eyes to water like crazy
i've used far too many creams that leave my eyes looking dry after only a couple of hours
made sure to get a jar of this
surprised to see reviews of drying out skin
this is the only oil cleanser i've used that didn't break me out like mad
this still has a good foam to it
i got a little cautious with the reviews as a lot of people claimed this product did not leave their skin moisturized or feeling good
one thing i will say is that you should apply a moisturizer or oil after using the cleanser because it does tighten up your face a little bit
find myself always coming back to this cleanser
whenever i use something irritating or have really dry skin
i've noticed my skin isn't as oily as it used to have a tendency to be as well
it clears off any make up i'm wearing while not leaving my skin too dry
it does not strip skin at well
not super oily in feel.
i love it- i have sensitive skin that can get dry when i use harsh cleansers
it doesn't dry my skin out or make it too oily.
this cleanser alone doesn't seem to get my skin clean enough
the makeupbreakup is just too oily for me
no more face wash break out for me.
your skin will love it.
it manages to clean away excess oil from my t-zone without leaving the rest of my skin dry
you may want to avoid it or just remember to moisturize very
since i have fairly dry skin
it doesn't really foam up at all
it is never drying or oily.
winter can be pretty hard on my skin
it doesn't dry my skin like most cleaner.
i didn't think an oily cleanser would do much
does not leave my skin dry at all.
you have to rub the cleanser onto your skin when it's dry
many products either cause me to break out or dry out
i think because this doesnt have soap or anthing foaming it just works perfectly with my skin
even though my skin usually throws a rash or some sort of temper tantrum at any excuse
unlike a lot of other oils that leave a residue
i feel like it moisturizes enough that it doesn't strip my face
it also dries me up enough so that my t-zone is noticeably less oily throughout the day
most facial washes i've tried have left my skin feeling extra dry
it doesn't leave any oily residue
does not foam at all
i will never use another face wash!!!
this is my favorite cleansing oil for hot weather
it dries my skin out too much
does not dry out my skin
the only issue i had with it not removing completely was some cream/gel eye liner that i had coated on pretty thick
i wet my face with water
it does not foam up
leave my skin dry
it never makes me red or dry.
making it not very usable in the same way as the makeup breakup cooling cleansing oil is
i would not recommend using this the same way as other cleansing oils by using it on totally dry skin to remove your makeup--as i see others have tried to use it
feeling so soft without drying me out
if your skin is parched like mine in the winter months
this will help replenish your skin
to me that's a good sign as a lot of lather can strip moisture from your skin
you have to squeeze it out
i don't think it has dried my skin out or gave it any extra unnecessary oil
the boscia oil-gel does not do that.
is to apply to a dry face
then add a little water
i find it mild
i don't end up with a black area around my eyes or feel any stinging like i would with the oil makeup remover
the only thing i don't like is that it leaves my skin feeling a bit dry after i wash it off
it's not so dry that i'll get flakes or feel uncomfortable
people with dry skin might not want to use this product
it did not hydrate as well as i would like
it did not sink in to my skin
i would not suggest this for thoes with dry skin.
i will probably return this since it doesnt give my skin the moisture it needs
it does the job without breaking my sensitive skin out
can feel quite sticky on the face
especially in these dry
this mask is light enough you can sleep in it
i feel like it is my best defense against dry indoor air this winter
t's hard to find products that work that don't flare up my condition
at the same time not irritate your skin
i would recommend this product if you're looking to nourish your skin overnight
in the winter months i tend to get pretty dry
takes care of those dry patches
you get this glow from it.
or if i just use a tiny bit it works as a moisturizer as well
i couldn't get it to close around my eye area or it would burn/turn red a little
my skin is very dry with a few oily patches in the t zone
it helps a lot to keep your skin hydrated when you don't have a major budget to use
it does make your skin a bit sticky when you first apply it
i do not rinse off in the morning
the formula is thick so a little goes a long way if you apply it thinly
not at all irritating either.
can get oily if i put in my t-zone areas
this product would be perfect for someone with dry skin though
wash it off first thing
i really need moisture that isn't greasy or oily
i really recommend this product to someone with dry skin
this is the only moisturizer i own that fully moisturizes my skin- i can really feel it sink in instead of sitting on top of my skin
it doesn't make my skin feel sticky
it getting on your pillow
i don't have this problem because i apply a thin layer to absorb into my face
neck so my recommendation would be to not overdo it
this honestly saved all my dry patches
when i do not moisturize my face enough i get very oily
my skin just got very oily during the day
it's not sticky and does not irritate my skin.
got rid of all my dry patches
i sometimes mix it into my day cream if it's super cold outside
this however not only completely got rid of all those dry patches
usually somewhat flakey by the end of the day if i don't use the right products
it does leave an awful shine on skin
my skin gets so dry in the winter that my forehead will actually start flaking from the lack of moisture
particularly to anyone whose skin needs a little extra love during cold months
this is great for when you have super dry skin especially during winter months
i will use it after my moisturizer if my skin is really needing some extra tlc or just use it as a night cream
my skin is extra dry in the winter
i put this on my very dry skin
my skin tends to get really dry during this season
i live in a very dry climate
this mask is perfect for making sure my night serum works into my skin
so here's the thing: i have combination skin that gets extremely dry at certain times of the month
i wouldn't recommend for break-out prone or oily skin types
i think the silicones in this will be great to protect skin from the dry winter air
another bonus to that is that it doesn't make my hair around my face greasy
i love this mask because my combo skin is slightly on the dry side with the weather transitioning in to fall
there are never any dry patches
my oily areas don't feel any more oily
maybe suggesting to oily people that they don't apply to their super oily areas until they know how their skin will react
i would recommend this mask to everyone especially those with extremely dry skin like i have
i would even suggest doing a face peel right before then letting this product set overnight for super soft
i found that my "oilier" parts were greasy when i woke up
when usually i wake up without excess oil
only getting drier as i get older
in the morning when i wash it off my face is incredibly smooth
perhaps that's because it is super moisturizing which would reduce the oil production anyway
use a thin layer or it will be too sticky to sleep in
especially since it doesn't have bad chemicals in it
i will be switching back to my moisture pack next time bc i don't see any great advantage of this mask over my old faithful
it's worth a try if you don't have an hg moisture mask yet
i don't have any issues with my pillow getting greasy
now that the weather here is warming up
this product is wonderful for getting moisture deep down into your skin
if you are on the oilier side
it is very rich so keep that in mind when wearing it to sleep
comfortable the down side is it takes a while to dry down causing by any hair on my pillow or sheets to stick to me
not really soak in
i don't find it as moisturizing as i thought it was going to be
i literally have never used a product that has almost instantly changed the texture of my skin until i slathered this on
it just gives your skin that extra oompf
it stays a little "tacky" on my skin for quite a while after applying
it's thick but not heavy or greasy on the skin.
this is definitely not a product for people with oily skin
it is my opinion that those who have a combination of normal/dry to very dry skin should try it
this is the only moisturizer i have ever used that gives enough hydration without breaking me out
when i try anti-aging products they are usually thick
my skin just changed from combo to dry
it doesn't leave that much of a greasy residue
it was so thick that i had to use a lot of it to get an even layer on my face
a really good moisturizer especially during the winter when my skin gets dry
don't recommend using it in the morning because it does make my skin just a little oily
although it feels very thick when i put it on
my skin is super extra oily yet when i put this on
have to be careful that whatever cream i use isn't too greasy or heavy
it don't use it every night because i don't want my skin to get accustomed to the anti-aging cremes at this point
this is the only moisturizer i have used which has absorbed into my skin so well
i don't feel greasy from the cream
not with this stuff underneath
this is a great product if you have dry skin.
i love how this masks feels as you wash it off
it is much more dry than a 20
this does not cake underneath
not sure if age, stress or lack of sleep.
i feel that my makeup does not crease as it would with the heavier eye creams i've used
found it didn't give my eye area quite enough moisture in the cold winter months
not oily at all
you definitely just need to dab it on.
this doesn't make my face greasy or break out
it also provides just the right amount of moisture without feeling to heavy or greasy
i like this cream because it is very light.
it makes my face so smooth, not greasy at all.
i don't have to rub it in
i tend to use as a night cream.
i see a lot of reviews on here of skin peeling
your skin has to get used to it first
which can be really oily
not to heavy or too light.
not greasy at all.
i would wake up with oily slick over my skin
i do not get as oily in the morning as i used to
it is not thick at all
it can sometimes leave my skin a bit oily after several hours
m happy to get both in this non-drying cream
not at all greasy
is not greasy or oily at all
still have combination skin with an oily t-zone
it moistures without leaving a greasy feeling or look
it immediately sinks into my skin without leaving any greasy feel or shine to my skin
foundation which normally with any other oil free moisturizer it would leave me shiny
my t zone can get a little oily
oils before that i either had bad reactions to
got some acne because of it or my skin was still greasy when i woke up
my skin does not look greasy nor oily when i wake up
you start patting it into your skin
i must say i have oily, sensitive skin.
the problem i constant have with every other moisturizer i have tried is that my skin feels dry after 20 minutes
best of all i don't look oily even after a long day at work
the consistency reminded me of an old cold cream
by the way my skin tends to be oily if i use the wrong items however this keeps my skin soft
it is made from algae so thickness should not be a surprise
i started using this as a night cream because of how thick it is
i feel like i am constantly trying to balance the moisture in my skin without breaking out
it doesn't make me any oilier
after using two drops of oil a little of this cream goes a long way
this cleansed my combo skin so well without stripping it too much
it's hard to find a product that can provide adequate moisture without making my skin feel greasy
you may not be into this product if you're sensitive to scented products--this cream definitely has a strong
yes, but worth it if you have dry sensitive skin.
have no problems with it feeling oily
it doesn't absorb over the genius cream as well
eye cream because i wasn't sure if i wanted to shell out $100 for the cream itself
i've never found another moisturizer that hits the balance of what i need so perfectly
provides just the right amount of moisture without feeling overly oily
feels just fine in the summer even when i should be getting oily it keeps my skin in check always
my skin has always been dry esp in winter
it's still too early to tell how this cream rates as an anti-aging cream
ed to my skin looking better so quickly
when my skin usually is at its worst
i find it doesn't irritate my eye area at all
i don't use it in the morning unless i'm housebound for the day as it tends to make me look like a grease ball within a few hours
it did not irritate my skin at all
very nice to know it is helping my skin through the night to maintain moisture
your skin looks oily during the day
very light but i could eat it.
my skin recently started to react to the cold weather
does not go on sticky
it does not feel thick
it did not cause any breakouts or leave my skin oily
it is not heavy
not sure i need an expensive face cream habit
totally non-greasy with a light
my skin is never dry anymore with this.
it was just what my dry flaky skin needed
a bit more of a face-oil texture than the other algenist cream i tried
takes care of my drier skin condition for the cold weather
this is the only cream that i can apply to my chin area
now i can skip the dessert that goes to my hips
i can see how this cream can help prevent over-drying
oily skin may not like how greasy this can become a few hours in
is a lot less oily/shiny
towards the end of the day i don't have that oily sheen on my face
the only cream that i have ever known that the moisture was totally locked in all day
my old parched dry skin is not feeling so parched anymore
as soon as i peel it off it brings all the gross stuff in my pimples to pop
thought this would make my skin too dry
this mask is amazing if you have oily skin!
i don't particularly recommend it if you have sensitive skin because it's a little tough to peel off
right after i use it my pores do feel tighter
then it takes longer to dry if you put enough on which can make my skin burn a little
i recommend this product to anyone who doesn't want any oily skin or apparent blackhead on your face
most masks either don't get enough out or strip the skin way too dry
it took me a long time to perfect a skin care routine to fix the damage that caused to my very sensitive skin
when i peel it off i can actually see all the gunk it took with it
my face appeared much less oily after just one use
what i do is apply a slightly thick layer
i found it a little bit difficult to peel the first time i used it
i only gave 4 stars because the mask is difficult to peel if you don't apply a thick enough layer
i've never had so much fun cleaning my face!
don't get you all mad trying to peel off it works on the feel of your skin also leaves your skin soft to the touch
i love that it is a peel off
i only use peel-off masks because they aren't messy
this mask made it so that i no longer feel the blackheads whenever i feel around my nose with my finger
this mask did not over dry my face or make it red
clean out your pores so whatever treatment or serum you put on afterwards is able to soak in
i recommend it if you wear a lot of make up or if you have acne or oily prone skin
i would suggest using a moisturizer right after this mask as the peeling effect can leave your skin feeling a bit dry
this mask makes my skin look incredible immediately after i peel it off
you really have to apply it evenly for it to peel off
to get a feel of how it will dry
can you say perfect environment for dark spots!!!
it makes your skin look amazing right after you remove it
peel off masks are always fun
you can actually see the impurities coming out of your skin
my only recommendation is to be wary if you have super dry skin- this was fabulous
it kinda hurts to peel it off in the winter
the first time i used the mask i wasn't sure how to peel it off
you can actually see the junk from your pores when peel it off
i didn't find this to dry my skin like other reviewers said
t felt quite dry on my face
my face is also not as oily as it was before
not crazy… when i peel it off
make sure to put a thin layer because if it's too thick it takes a long time to dry
some parts won't even dry so you can peel them off
i found it to dry my skin out badly
it did however draw out any impurities i had.
this mask is different in that once it dries one would peel it off instead of washing
especially the ones that dry
it got rid of my excess oil
didn't dry me out- which is particularly important during the winter
i didn't experience any burning or stinging.
this product is my go too when parts of my face feel slick or congested
this works really well for getting that satisfying peeling feeling when you peel it off
it does also work really well at cleaning your skin
so if you want a deep clean, slab it on.
as the mask is drying you can feel it pulling your skin tight
it should peel off great
it also didn't hurt coming off like many peel-off masks do
it is extremely fussy to remove after it has dried
it doesn't clog my pores or do anything to my super sensitive skin
it never gets dried out either
it was super easy to peel off
my mask did not peel of near as well as the video
the peeling takes forever to get this off
i actually really like this peel off mask
because i have oily skin it doesn't pull out black heads like i though
i only use it when my skin breaks out which is not very often
maybe peel off masks just aren't for me
i could not get the bloody thing to peel
washed it off like i normally do
this takes care of the extra oils in my t-zone
off type mask you can visibly see it work once you remove it
the whole mask didn't dry well
it is think out of the tube
i normally need to with my thirsty skin
i also like the hint of red color so you can see what you are peeling off vs
my skin is pretty "normal" i don't really get oily nor do i get dry
it draws out whatever is inside of my skin
it could get a bit messy
it doesn't dry properly
this mask is difficult to clean off
a little goes a long way as it foams up
this product is great for the summer months when my skin is extra oily
it's hard to find a cleanser that can actually remove long wear make up without being too harsh on the skin
it had worked out better that the other face wash i was using from alba
today is wasnt even half as oily like it normally is
radicals without leaving my face feel super dry or stripping my face of all its oils
while the other products have fallen out of my routine this one has stuck around as i find it provides a great clean feel without the stripping/drying feeling found in other cleansers
mostly because i feel like it isn't working while i'm washing
this is great for those of us with oily skin.
lots of cleansers meant for oily skin can leave my skin feeling dry
even in my oily areas
it dries out my skin like crazy
so my skin will be really dry in the winter
really oily in the summer
when the weather started to get warmer
it did feel a little drying once i patted my skin dry
i wouldn't recommend this for drier skin types or for the winter
it may be a little too drying then
i will definitely run back to this when it gets warmer
but clean-removed of all oil and nasty junk.
does not get oily throughout the day
get a good lather going
i don't use it every day as my skin gets dried out very easily
this is my go to for the occasional bad pimple i get
i just use a little only on the breakout to wash
i typically get my face wet to break up my make up then apply a dime size of this product all over then apply my clarisonic
it doesn't leave my skin parched
most cleaners either do not clean my face enough our clean so harsh my face is dried out
did a good just at cleaning my face
i'd recommend for anyone with combo or oily skin
it doesn't dry me out either.
normal soap wouldn't get the smell off
though it does leave my skin a little dry in some places after washing
it feels great on oily t-zone
get this if you like a deep cleanse once or twice a week
about a year ago in the shower i needed to wash my face because i refuse to not wash it after a full day of being active my face needs to be clean
this tube will lasts for awhile
have always had oily
it can be used with a damp or dry face
i prefer dry as it gives a deeper clean
even my hands are soft from washing my face.
it doesn't feel as though a residue is left on your skin after use
this cleanser worked really well for me to help minimize oil without drying my skin out or making me break out
i needed something to really get my skin clean without being too harsh
this mask however didn't dry me out
it really dried out my skin
so much so that i got dry patches all over my face
not a clay which is fine by me
does not dry out my skin at all
mostly more oily in my t-zone
it doesn't dry my skin
other times really oily
it gets rid of most of my oiliness which is nice.
my face does tend to feel a bit tight after washing with this
i find myself blotting way less throughout the day
sometimes i don't even have to blot at all which is a miracle for my skin
it does wash off make up well
you can tell if you have dehydrated skin when your skin is dry yet it still produces oils
people with dry skin do not produce oils
this mask doesn't make my face oily
t has time to dry or else my pillow will be orange
will use this product more in the winter when my skin feels dry or after tanning
the tint does not come off on your skin
i let it soak in
just want your skin to glow in general you need this mask
that i don't like using it overnight since it still feels a bit sticky
love it because it sits on your skin while you sleep it's almost like medicine working its magic
it makes my face oily in the morning
i don't feel like my skin is as dry as it was before
i live in a very dry climate
already have dry skin
i definitely recommend it for anyone who has dry or dull skin
moisterizing enough to not have any other lotion on
i love the idea of a sleeping mask because i don't have to mess with peeling it off or washing it off
it's a decent sized bottle with a thick consistency formula that won't drip into your eyes or mouth like most facial oils so that's a huge plus
less dry face since using it
when i work out, my neck gets sweaty and dry.
it revives dull looking skin to give a sheen almost when you wake up its hard to describe how it works since i just revamped my whole skin car routine
haven't had any break outs or irritations although my skin is sensitive + combination dry
in the beginning i just sprayed too much cream
for me it worked better to apply a nice thick layer
it is less greasy than shiseido
i hoped it would help my winter dry skin.
sometimes i leave on certain "problem spots" while i sleep
it goes on light, but not too light.
helps with elasticity it spreads very well under the eyes so you don't have to rub at all
not as greasy as shiseido
it is really light and not greasy.
eye creams that really give a lot of moisture without feeling like an oil slick on my face
i get very little sleep
it may not be hydrating enough for the over 45+ crowd
they all end up irritating my skin
the concentrate seems a little "thick" when you first apply it
type of feeling when applied
so this eye cream is great for drier months
nice treat for your face :)
the instant face mask is incredible if you want a cooling energizing face mask
this cream did not mess up any under eye makeup application like most eye creams tend to do
you feel the cooling effect right away after application
i do find it on the oily side
my bf can usually tell the night after whenever i used this cream
i can only imagine that the extra moisturization will diminish them
this is the only thing that has ever gotten rid of the extreme dry patches on my face completely
my skin has been horribly dry as far back as i can remember
i found the best routine for my oily skin to look amazing especially in the summer after im out in the heat all day
i usually put something over it though because my 32 year old skin is very "thirsty" after 30 years of being an oily mess
it did leave a bit of a gloss
this is a must have product for dry skin.
it does a great job at hydrating your skin without being too heavy or greasy
you really need only 2 drops to cover your face
i'd recommend getting the smallest bottle first just to see if it suits your skin
it does feel like you're putting oil on you skin at night before bed
leaves my skin softer than any expensive night cream/gel has been able to do yet
if you're worried about it being "too oily" or causing you to break out
now i'm so please dry patches gone
then i was freaking out all over again because the texture was a soft yet greasy feel
it did not make my skin any more oily
all the weird dryness from winter was gone
doesn't reach into the bottle enough to properly dispense enough of the milk every time
not too light where it won't help my skin hold the moisture in
doesn't leave you looking greasy
at first i just paid mind to the moisture effect.
it didn't feel sticky or too oily.
sometimes they sit on top of my skin
i only use it at night because i do find it feels a little tacky on the skin
i wouldn't use it as a facial moisturizer because my skin is getting a bit oily even in the cold months
my face is normally combo/oily t-zone with the rest of my body being very dry
it gets really tight with dry patches in the winter
it might work well for someone with a mildly dry to normal skin or someone in a less harsh climate
does not leave an oily residue
this is one of the few things that helps with my very dry skin from the tough minnesota winters
i find that my skin does not get enough hydration from the milk alone
gives you that little extra you need for dry skin without feeling greasy
i love it because my skin is dry
this along with the josie maran cleansing oil has really helped save my skin from me using a very drying face wash
i like it because it is a little thicker than your average oil
have to see how it holds up in the cold
in winter when i get drier combo skin this will be awesome
it really does help moisturize my normally dry face very well
or if i get an outbreak of patches of dry skin again
i do notice its better when i am not in humidity
it's great since i hate using or finding lotion for my face
perfect for anyone with oily skin or combo
i used only just enough to cover my skin
use sparingly or youll end up looking greasy
my skin was so dry during my pregnancy until i found this product
i still use it every time my skin feels dry
i'd say if you have oily skin
only use it when i am super dry because i dislike the oily feeling
this argan milk sinks right into your skin without any greasy feeling
this treatment does wonders for my dry skin.
definitely give it a go if you're experiencing a flare up in your skin
it is not greasy
it just felt like a big drink of water for my skin
right when i put it on i instantly feel moisture
it may be too much for someone with oily skin
inn the summer it makes your skin look really oily
find it to be too oily for my combo skin
from my oily t zone to my dry eyes
as soon as i put it on my skin i felt my skin drink it up
you need this for a mid to end pimple situation
this makes my dry skin go away immediately
unlike other oils it doesn't make it so my makeup comes off easily or slides around
absorb otherwise it'll get to greasy
if my face is really dry
or if i've just used a harsh mask
then i'll rub in the rest and wash my face.
this is the perfect level of hydrating for me because i don't have dry or oily skin
it may get oily if you do have oily skin
i can be both incredibly oily
incredibly dry at the same time
'm constantly trying to keep up with how drying the cabin air is on my skin
i think it has gotten less oily because of my new routine
my skin didn't seem to need any face cream after i use this
living through minnesota winters make my face dry out to the point that it just hurts
my t-zone not overly oily
the next time my skin is desperately craving moisture i'll be reaching for this stuff
then i have parts of my face that gets oily
not leave me so oily after a long day or leave me with a good level of moisture in my skin
what more is it supposed to do than hydrate your skin?
it really helped my dry patches
usually i use my towel to wash off this mask because i always put a very thick layer of this mask on my face which is very time consuming to take off without towel
i think they should warn customers not to wash-off with towels
it's not oily or sticky.
rather than having the moisture disappear as soon as the product did
i usually have such dry skin
it did burn a little
usually when i use very hydrating products they tend to make my t zone a little oily in the morning
don't know if this is enough hydration for someone with dry skin
then once finding out it was the hydrating one i strategically used it whenever i had super dry skin from my acne products
think it's good for strategic use if you have oily skin
it's usually all absorbed by then
doesn't feel heavy or clog your pours if you leave it on over night
there seems to always be a thin layer left on the skin that is cleaned off later
the face washes i use tend to really dry out my face
putting this on overnight gets rid of any dry patch i've ever had
i even use it sometimes before putting on makeup just to get rid of a dry spot or two on my face
i like that it doesn't feel sticky like other masques
now use at least once a week or whenever i see any trace of dry patches forming
my skin no longer flakes off all winter long
how quickly things can go wrong when masks mess with my skin's moisture
when i use the mask as the night treatment on my entire face i do notice that i get blackheads after
as long as you are cleansing your skin properly you should not break out
when i put it on i can feel it absorb into my skin
it gets super oily to the point that any makeup just slicks right off
my skin doesn't get super oily throughout the day
usually i have oily skin
moisturized look i need to add a lot of moisture to my skin the night before to let my skin soak it all up
some products make it to dry
i love adding to my night time routine or whenever i feel my skin needs a boost of moisture
love the fact you don't need to wash it of cause your skin absorbs all the moisture
you don't even need to wash it off because your skin just absorbs the moisture
this product didn't irritate my skin at all.
there is a cocnut smell to it which goes away pretty fast after applying it
it's great for spot treatment of dry areas as well
then you can either rinse it off or rub it in fully
i usually use in the shower
it really does help with dry skin.
i always like to use a mask after i've been drinking to help out my skin
usually after i use the supermud since it can be a little drying
or even normal skin for a little pick me up
i tend to apply it right before bed so when i wake up my skin looks alive
is amazing for anyone dealing with dry skin
a little goes a long way if used only in drier spots on the face
the product itself didn't do much for my suppper dry skin
this is a must have product to save your skin through cold weather
so you don't put your fingers in the pot
having oily skin usually causes me to shy away from products with the word "hydrating" in them
it's important to remember that sometimes you can cause your skin to over produce oil if you aren't hydrating it
if you do have oily skin
i would recommend using this product once a week or once every 2 weeks to get the moisture back into your skin
thats not the only thing it's also super hydrating which i need because my skin gets very dry during the winter
i would totally recommend this for dry skin!
in the winter in really dry
this has been a godsend with dry winter weather.
i tend to have oily
it feels like you are on a tropical isl
or if i feel that my skin needs a moisture boost
don't wash it off.
it didn't get rid of my uneven texture
i occasionally get those dreaded dry
like so dry you could see my skin flaking through my foundation dry
i've never had so much hydration with any other "mask"
this stuff does wonders in clearing up my dry patches
it gets rid of the dry patches on my face.
i didn't realize that the mud mask wasn't in there
i felt it was hyped up by you tubers only because they get paid to hype it up
i won't have any dry patches
as i don't ever wipe it off
cream is not too light weight or heavy it just so good on my skin
is how it saved my skin in the -70f dry arctic environment
my face actually gets oily with it
the cream really lasts a long time if you take a small bit on each ring finger
if you don't mix with at least one drop of oil it will start to flake part in your face as you apply
nothing got rid of my dry, flaky skin.
this is the only moisturizer i have used that has completely eliminated the dry flakes
after one use, my skin was no longer flaky.
if your skin is parched
one has to get all pores cleaned out before you see the special qualities
if my skin is extra dry i'll use it for day time as well
i wasn't sure about this because a lot of heavy creams make me break out
the oily parts are really oily
the finish it would leave on my skin would be too shiny for my taste during the day
don't rub this in or you'll have troubles if used over other products
i like this one better because even though it is very thick it somehow feels lighter on my skin
the only con is that it can make my eyes water
dry eye issues so many products cause this to happen
it wasn't doing anything to help keep the dryness at bay since i started using retin a
it's hard for me to "settle down" with any one bran for product
no matter what my skin felt dry and looked dry.
being that it is so thick
over application will result in it balling up or flaking off if you touch your face
my problem areas are less oily
none of the nastey ingredients prevalent in every skin care line that wreak havoc on your skin
i think some of the comments about flaking or a waxy texture is because the user is using too much if the product
it really does get flakey if you rub your skin
because it is so thick
i read a lot of reviews about this cream balling up or flaking off
it has never balled up or done anything weird to my skin
my skin is really dry this winter
either it is too soon for your skin to h
they're usually bad in the winter when i'm most dry
the reality is that the sunscreen element is always going to look dry on the undereye eventually
it still gets quite dry
t's really tough to find sunscreen that won't irritate my eyes
very dry skin types might want more moisture from an eye product
pretty much any product containing enough physical sun block will
i prefer this cleansing oil as it does not leave my pores congested like the balm version
protects your eyes at the same time with no painful burn
especially when transitioning to colder weather
doesn't leave my eyes oily
i even get moon burn.
i think the daily sun exposure has something to do with it
great eye cream for sun protection on a everyday basis because you still want to protect the eyes with spf
does not make my skin oily
this stuff is the only spf that won't burn badly
for reference i have combo-oily skin that is not usually sensitive to anything
then it doesn't sting
if you want to make sure your eye area is proper protected from the sun
i'd say this is a good eye cream to get
it doesn't sting or burn my eyes
i can always use another eye cream underneath
much as many of us often do for facial sun protection
no eye sting or burning no matter how much i sweat
i don't get oily during the day
i didn't think it would give me enough moisture in places--it was so lightweight
only thing i've had on my skin that actually cools it when you put it on
it's the only one i've tried that doesn't leave my face feeling sticky
i usually follow up with a face wash afterwards
powerful enough to remove yucky stuff off eyes
to swipe up any residue i think is best
i even use it as a cleanser when i'm too lazy to wash my face at night
get all the crud off my face
the oil really does dissolve all the make up
sometimes i just cleanse my face with this
i feel like it does the job without drying out my skin
work with water in order to clean your skin effectively
when there's no time to wash thoroughly
for those of you out there who don't like toners
not tight or dry
it does sting my eyes if i get it into my waterline
it's also nice to use in the morning when a foamy cleanser might be too much
it did a really nice job taking off my liquid foundation
never a good sign when you have to go get your normal cleansing water
to clean up the mess that your new cleansing water just made on your face
if you used this as your only cleanser it may leave some residue which i think would be good for dry skinned girls
then i wait for my face to "dry" then i use this
i can see the make up that the wipe didn't get slowly melt away
easy to use-i just rub it all over my face like using face wash in shower
my face feels very soft when i rinse it off too.
it doesn't leave my face dry
not dry at all
first let me start off by saying that it will melt almost all of your makeup with just a few pumps
the second thing that matters the most to me is that the formula doesn't ruin your regular nail polish
somehow there's just a nasty film like residue left behind with some
where some days i'm more oily
i prefer this over than the balm form because it's more hygenic
i love this "cleansing oil" it is actually not an oil
this is great for oily dry combo skin that breaks out
you'll need to rinse a couple times with water
you're going to get a fair amount of transfer when you wipe your face after rinsing
so when i go to wash my face
does not leave residue
not too greasy and oily.
i personally think it is a good as she eumura famous cleansing oil without the high price tag
hopefully they will have it like in "spray" bottle
this one can remove all the dirts without giving me any breakout
does not dry out my skin
i never feel any residue afterwards.
usually follow it up with my regular face cleaner
it does burn my eyes a bit
just make sure to completely rinse away the product with water
as cold water does not have the same effect
you will know when it is off your skin as while being removed it turns a milky white
once there is none of this milky residue coming off you will know that your skin will be clear of makeup
love to use this before washing my face.
or sweating a lot that day
so that when you actually wash your face with soap
i switched to the oil because it feels more hygenic instead of scooping product out of a tub every day
i don't notice any breakouts or oilyness or tingling after using it which is great because i have very sensitive yet combo skin
toner to check how much is still left on your face
does not irritate my oily
i love that it does not dry out my already dry skin
doesn't dry out my skin which is important when following up with another
this was the first cleansing oil i tried that didn't cause breakouts or leave my skin feeling greasy
i love this make up remover so much
dirt without over drying my skin or making it too oily
this oil basically dissolves any set-in foundation that otherwise would remain on your skin even with washing
doesn't dry out my combo skin
not that i like a thick formula
this cleansing oil does not break me out
i feel when i use a make up wipe i'm really tugging at my skin
i like using the pump much more than the take the day off balm in the tub
however it does leave your vision cloudy
i would have to keep rinsing my eyes out to clear them
i definitely prefer the take the day off eye make up remover because i would just dab that on a cotton pad
t doesn't irritate my skin
but make sure you put it on dry skin.
rub it in like you would a normal face wash.
so although it doesn't come with the coolest pump or have a good scent
it will clean out your pores like no other
clean -not oily whatsoever
i keep getting acnes when only using clarisonic to clean my face
i love this product because i think it's easier for me daily routine than the makeup removers
the oil is very gentle i never had any burning in my eyes from rubbing the mascara off
you put it on your dry face rub all over
when i apply my toner on directly afterwards there is not a hint of color on the cotton ball
my skin is basically "normal" maybe tends to be slightly dry at times
but this cleansing oil (when used properly!)
use it on a dry face
doesn't leave my skin dry which is great!
i apply to my dry face
then i apply water
i still use a face wash after this, though.
not oily at all
even to those with oily skin
it didn't dry my skin
what i find amazing is how it leaves no oily residue unlike some cleansing oils i have tried
i wanted a cleanser that wouldn't leave my skin feeling dried out
since most of the wipes or soaps i'd been using recently were leaving my skin feeling tight or irritated
it does not make my face feel oily or leave any residue on my face
this doesn't clog it or make it worse
it gets rid of all the tough make up in one wash
other make up removers require you to wash more than one to get rid of everything
it gets rid of any trace of makeup or sweat or anything that ends up on my skin by the end of the day
there wasn't any leftover makeup on the cotton pad so one less product i have to use
i would use coconut oil all over my face to get rid of the make up then wipe it off with kleenex
not oily at all
most primers for pores honestly aren't meant for your whole face
the oil does not leave a residue on my face which is nice
just a few pumps in your dry h
it doesn't dry out your skin
the oil-based make up remove does the trick for even the most stubborn eye make up without making me break out
it doesn't dry out my skin or make it oily either
also because it limits exposure of bacteria to the face --the last thing you want for your pores-- simple to apply
t tends to keep my face matte since i have oily skin which is a plus
not an all-over your face cream
i like the moisturizing effect so much that i am holding out hoping my skin will adjust in time
all a must when you have oily skin in a humid climate
just like all origins skin care
or left an overall weird sticky residue on my face
so you can squeeze every last ounce out of the tube
what it is is very moisturizing so may choose to skip your daily moistureizer it's not greasy
i do get just a little oily by the end of the day
it doesn't make me look oily even at the end of the day
my skin type is oily in my t zone.
too bad my sensitive combination skin is allergic to this because i'd buy it in bulk
for the last month i was thinking my skin doesn't look so smooth
it keeps my face from getting oily throughout the day
doesn't make me oily or make my makeup slide off later
its a perfect primer my face doesn't get oily unlike other products i've used before
its very moisturizing so you might want to avoid it if you have oily skin
they both feel weightless once applied to the face
i think it works better for those with oily skin.
don't require that their skin looks "perfect" every day
not at all greasy
it doesn't make my combination skin break out
doesn't weigh down my face or leave a weird residue
yet light enough for my skin
also doesn't irritate my sensitive skin or leave any kind of weird residue
its a good lightweight face lotion that doesn't make you feel oily throughout the day
this works really well if you have oily skin
this is a nice light lotion that does not make your face oily
or for a summer day that you won't just sweat off right away
evenly over my face that it doesn't take
it doesnt dry out my dry spots
i wanted a light lotion for daytime use that would sink into the skin easily
i don't have dry
its very hard for me to find a moisturizer that wont make me look oily
moisturising but not too heavy.
my makeup has probably applied easier with the moisture
it does flake off throughout the day
it was getting really cold out
how it keep my face moisture for hours in the california dry weather
not so heavy that it makes me super shiny halfway through the day
it feels like your skin can really breath
i might move to something a little heavier in moisture during winter
f you need a lot of moisture
like that it feels absorbed all the way when i rinse my face in the morning
not so much that you end up greasy
my skin always get dry
can't get a moisturizing face wash because i get extremely oily in the day time
it doesn't feel like it's laying on top of my skin like a lot of other creams i've tried in the past
the only problem is you need to replenish every month since 30ml is so easy to finish
while "drying" it never gets that dry face cracking feeling
first is that it doesn't dry down super tight.
i loath the feeling of anything drying down to a cracked solid on my skin
i like the way it makes my skin tingle as its drying
i don't drink enough water
glamglow thirsty mud depending on what i feel my skin needs
this mask fixes whatever my skin needs at the time
want that extra "glow
want to let my skin breathe
it is a mask that your skin can tolerate every day because it isn’t irritating
it's like giving yourself an at-home facial!
you can actually feel your skin breathe following the treatment
as it can be a bit drying if done too often
it wasn't oily or dry.
it does a great job on deep cleaning my skin without over drying
doesn't dry or irritate the skin like other clay masks do
it can feel a bit drying in winter
just a warning, it does get warm.
it doesnt really burn or sting it just gets hot.
it doesn't dry my skin out.
it also helps control my oily t-zone.
it can be over drying to my skin
this product is not overly drying
washing it off my skin was so much brighter
it's important to really massage it into the skin so those little beads break open
i would recommend this to anyone experiencing rough texture
when you put it on it doesn't make your face stiff to an annoying point
i do not have any skin problems except dry skin.
washing it off i could instantly tell my skin was smoother
i like that it does not dry out my already very dry skin
maybe because it doesn't dry out my skin like those did
never could get in to the cold plasma line.
it feels like mud mask when it's on the skin
doesn't pull your skin
i used on the days my skin felt dry
my skin was so dry that the woman helping me couldn't put any foundation on my skin because it just cracked
it didn't itch or get super dry at all
not at all like fish
not at all greasy for the oily t-zone
plus i can use it 2 to 3 times a week with no dryness
once you wash it off
did i mention it super easy to rinse off
not like drying hard to get off mask
i find that i can actually apply this with just my fingers whereas with glamglow's i had to use a foundation paddle brush to maximize the product usage
i felt like applying it with my fingers wasted too much product
fairly sensitive so usually i can't use clay masks they dry me out
its not uncomfortable to the point you want to take it off after 5 minutes like glam glow
when you take it off your skin feels so soft
that's not over dried or irritated
the little beads kind of stick to your pores when you wash it off- like you can see where it is pulling the gunk out
it doesn't stay on top of the skin to make it shiny
the dry patches would be back
dry to normal everywhere else
it didn't help my oily skin
after applying it is amazing because it does not leave a white ish residue on my face like most spf moisturizers do
i tend to have oily skin
it smells like a bag full of oranges :3 also really helps with any discolourations you may have
the only negative thing i can say is that i have very oily skin
it doesn't look oily or shine -- it just feels a little oily until your skin absorbs it fully
because of how dry my skin can be in those areas
it only feels greasy if you put too much.
therefore i would suggest letting it really sink into your skin before putting on foundation or concealer over top of it
even though it has spf
it is not too oily
it does feel slick when first applied
this doesn't make your face oily or dry
it can be a tiny bit greasy when first applied
it doesn't make me look oily
avoided spf because of that greasy feel until i found bbn
it doesn't burn or make me red
give me moisture to last the day
whenever i wear it under my foundation it really gives me this nice shine without it looking like i'm oily or greasy
it sits on the skin so my foundation doesn't last long without setting with powder
my face is really dry too
it doesn't leave a greasy shine
without being greasy or sticky
this doesn't have a scent or otherwise look manly except for the "for men" declaration
if i have a blemish i just spot treat it with this stuff
this product did not make my dark spots lighten up
did not make my skin tighter
i needed two dips to get enough to cover my face
it does not irritate my skin
which i almost never like in skin products
i couldn't find that in any other eye cream
this should be a for sure summer staple in everyone's makeup bag
i've had issues with so many under eye concealers either not blending well or blending so well that it doesn't correct my under eye circles
it doesn't irritate my skin at all
it does a great job covering my dark circles without being cakey
if not set by a powder
my only gripe is that any pressure on the tube makes a mess all inside the lid thus wasting some of the product unles i can dig it out
i will usually add a bit of powder on top of the product for a matte finish
feel like it could be a little drying
could be i used too much so it caked up.
this doesn't irritate or dry out my eyes
it's so great in fact that i've been able to skip under eye concealer some days
if you can keep it close by in the fridge where you apply makeup
this could even replace concealer for those of you who have mild dark circles because it really does cover well
this stuff is like a treat for your under eyes!
this is just my natural skin issue nothing to do with sleep
i find it hard sometimes just to get a little dab now that im half way through the tube
you can use it on its own to brighten your eyes
or you can use it under a concealer to combat any settling into fine lines
i especially love that it doesn't set in fine lines under the eyes like most concealers
i wasn't sure how a "pink" eye cream would work
i don't typically wear foundation
i do not use the tip to smooth it on my undereyes
feels more like the eye cream than anything
i do keep this in the fridges as eye creams are better applied when cold
i don't find the consistency thick nor does it cake on my under eye area
feels a little wrong to rub the undereye area to apply it
tightening mask that doesn't dry skin this is a good bet
it gives my skin such a pick me up
it worked best using wet fingers to apply it
otherwise it's too dry to get a smooth application
it did just that and always minimized my pores!
you are probably better off just jumping in the shower then using a simple warm wash cloth
this mask is frankly awesome if you have dry or sensitive skin
dry skins this is a great go to
it can dry out a bit in the jar.
if it gets dry
i love that it drys quickly
i do us the boscia konjac sponge to take it off it's easier that way
i think everyone agrees that the brightness effect is just temporary right after cleaning
it is not drying
now i didn't realize the product actually makes your skin feel very tight as it drys
made my usually dry
seems a little hard to apply on your face
which i can't use once the weather dries out
it feels a little minty for the first few minutes once apply on face
you can also see all the little algae inside the mask
oiliness in my t-zone is pretty much gone!
it is not drying
it does not dry up in the jar as long as you keep the lid tightly closed
which tends to look dull every so often from sleep deprivation
smooth not like other mask i tried
didn't turn my skin red nor dry
could not wait to wash my face
great for people that don't want the chemical peel type masks
comes off easily when you wash it off
don't use it right before a big day the first few times you use it as it does clean out your pores so you may get a whitehead or two at first
this product has help with my dryness so much.
it's like a drink of water for my face.
so dry that i couldn't even move my skin without moisturiser
it's like some magical potion that heals the dryness right away that no moisturiser could do the job half as well
i over did it trying to 'prep' my skin for a tropical vacation
my skin actually feels like it's holding moisture
it's no longer peeling and is not oily at all.
these drops feel more like water
i occasionally get very dry
etc without getting irritated
it may be a bit too nourishing in summer
when my skin will get usually oilier
i would recommend it for the oily skin type during the winter
for dry skin in summer
extremely dry in the winter
flaky skin that i normally have during the winter
this is the first product that actually keeps my face from flaking at all
this hydration booster is ideal in the summer because it does not add any oil or shine to my face
i didn't realize you had to be so careful about sunlight when using this
when i use this serum it maybe helps a little for burning
i am in a dry climate
i agree with the first reviewer thatyou need the whipping net in order not to waste the soap
make sure it's not sitting in water
does not lather a lot
it still looks basically unused
that you should use their wash afterwards
really work it into your skin
not only does it remove stubborn waterproof makeup i don't need to wash my face because of the oily residue that's left after using most cream removers
days when i indulge in a quick home facial i will work this cream to the oily consistency
because it doesn't irritate my skin in any way
the results of peely dry skin scare me much more
does not linger on the skin
it leaves my skin smooth without drying it out or irritating it
four stars because you can only massage it into the face for a minute or two before it dries
doesn't dry out my skin
not dry it out
this winter my skin has become really dry
you put it on your dry face then rub it in for a minute then you put the hot towel
as the weather gets colder
my skin gets drier i felt it was time to try a different cleanser
it doesn't stay warm super long
this really helped to clear up my super oily
not dry at all
i love the cloth that comes with it
my favorite part is that it's so gentle you can open your eyes while using
plain old stinky noxema has always been my daily go-to because it doesn't dry me out
that cloth is so nice
leaving a hot cloth on your face for a little bit is just so enjoyable
i literally have never felt this way about a cleanser
however because i don't wear make up it made my face a little dry
it does get sticky
when put in the fridge before use it makes for such a cool
i also notice that my pores seem smaller which is probably my favorite thing about this mask
i notice my skin start to warm up up a bit
i can't see my skin surviving without it
if you keep your skin fed
that i should splash cold water on it often
i do not find it hydrating in the slightest
it would be a little dry
occasionally my skin would become dry
maybe even heal the damage a bit quicker
it feels great after a hot day when the gel mask is cool before placing on your skin
nor too sticky that it comes off on my pillow as i have it on overnight
i struggle with dry skin
face washes will dry me out and then i break out.
it dried up pretty quick
it is so refreshing when you store it in your fridge
might get the cucumber one just to switch things up
when i use it cold
cool on my face
i applied it when it was cold
that it doesn’t get uncomfortable on your face
store it in your fridge for a refreshing end to your day
sometimes ill wear it overnight
i put it in the fridge to cool it.
i assure you this is an unfiltered up close no make up pic of my skin this morning
silly me i tried this sample the way it says to on the foil packet
it's great to sleep in overnight because it dries
isnt all slimy like most have been for me
probably a good thing for our cold, dry winters.
especially if you have sensitive skin because it has an instant cooling
i apply a little dab of this all over my face
let it soak in
i think for those prone to breakouts or clogged pores would probably not want to use it in this way
it does feel good after being in fridge however be careful because my pot cracked all the way firm the side as a result of doing this
very nice, especially during hot weather.
if u live in a dry climate
let it soak in without washing it off
i sometimes use it overnight sometimes as a mask.
you simply could be allergic or sensitive to roses
the few pimples that i do get don't last nearly as long
especially when it comes out of the fridge
the gel consistency still has a cool feeling when applied
either alone or over my facial oil
this is my first time to try the gel mask.
it seems to be clearing up my skin
a lot of the ptr products i've used have dried my skin out
a must for your skin care routine!
it doesn't feel dry or cakey on your skin
i always do the "toner test" to check if there's any residue
i actually use it in the shower as a face wash
if you tilt the bottle just a little bit too much you end up with a very soapy face
this is the only non scrub i've used so far that actually feels like my skin has been cleaned
not drying at all
i guess my skin is a little drier in the winter
a little oilier in the summer
it was too drying to my skin.
flaky patches no matter what i did
i found it didn't thoroughly remove all my make up
then lathers up when you add more water
since its a gel you don't have to use a lot
trave a lot from dry weather to really humid
as i am generally a lengthy face washer anyways
it also doesn't dry out my skin.
i would not use this without my clarisonic because it would leave a residue behind with just trying to rinse it off alone
i usually use only water to wash my face
as i've come to expect breakouts from any face wash or mask
the nice scent what i also really like that it doesn't dry out my skin
just add water if it's not spreading well enough
it get my face clean without drying it out.
all i need is a little drizzle to get my face cleaned
it can be a little harsh in an every-day face wash
i would gladly give up the "lather effect" if this gel would be made sulfate-free
not over drying and doesn't leave a gross film.
i swear that my pores also look smaller after using it just once a day
i've found it needs a lot of water to lather properly
it does not dry the life out of my skin
can already tell by washing 2x a day a difference
it is a thick gel that needs to get wet to be able to spread
i could feel a difference in my skin as i was rinsing it off the first time i used it
didn't leave me dry at all.
not dry or tight
this cold winter has not been kind to it
my skin is much more dry than when i was younger
i still don't find myself getting oily
it doesn't break up, get patchy, or look greasy.
i did notice this does not clog my pores as fast as other foundations
occasionally i have an oily t-zone
i never look oily at the end of the day using this foundation
radiant finishes are usually a no-go in texas where even in november we have 80 degree days with high humidity
beautiful finish with just enough coverage to hide what needs to be hidden without a makeup-y look or feel
doesn't show any dryness of my skin like all other foundations do
they are much too drying in the winter
it seems to really disappear on my skin
it stays on all day even with my oily skin.
it gets a little slick on reeeally humid days
for summer skin that doesn't melt off in 2 minutes
they always look cakey or greased out by the end of the day
i usually use some sort of mattifying primer on my chin
my nose where i can get oily during the day
sometimes go over it with my beauty blender after just to make sure it's really in my skin
it can occasionally cling to them
i also find it doesn't layer very well if you have any makeup underneath
doesn't leave my skin oily
in the winter it gives me just a little extra color so that i don't look like casper
other products cause dry patches or break outs
so many foundations tend to dry me out or cause some irritation
perfect for my changing skin as i'm getting older
sun protection yet feels like nothing is on your face
the pores on my nose tend to look bigger with makeup which is obviously annoying
or until you wash it off
that combined with oiliness makes me want to give up
doesn't cover a lot with just one layer.
the texture feels kind of oily when you start applying it
i don't set my face with powder when i use this
it doesn't get oily on me throughout the day.
there's no need for me to set it with a powder
at least as cheap as my bare skin foundation.
typically by the end of the day a light foundation or bb cream that started off great looks very oily
it held back the moisture without looking too matte
this color is slightly too dark for me unless i'm straight back from vacation
if you just want a more even complexion without completely covering your skin
it does need powder touch ups throughout the day
i would not recommend to my pale skin ladies out there
if your skin is mostly problem free
it will make you look more youthful if your skin is clear
regular foundation was too thick or just didn't feel good
it is long-wearing, even with my oily t-zone.
the only critique i would give it is that my skin looks a little "dewy" after applying it
when using this you do need to let it dry for about 5 minutes before applying powder
i blend it well on my neck so not a big issue
it held up beautifully with the heat without feeling heavy or looking cakey
i usually have to mix something a little lighter in with it
covers what i want to hide without being heavy
don't like wearing other foundations because i find them to be too cakey or irritating
this does not make my t zone oily nor my cheeks dry
i didn't want it to be heavy or cakey
i don't like to look made up or have the feeling of heavy foundation
i am convinced that the people who are complaining it's too orange accidentally got the bronzer which is packaged in the same bottle
i actually prefer to use my fingers first
i typically don't like to wear a full face of foundation--in fact
i usually just apply it around my t-zone to even out some of my redness in that area
it is for someone wanting a more natural color.
did not irritate my skin
definitely recommend for people with oily skin!!
dry patches on my face so this product actually was great for my skin
normally by the end of a day my dry skin is showing through my makeup
it has proven to be difficult for me to maintain the perfect balance when it comes to avoiding oily skin without over drying
i read somewhere that it left the skin greasy
you can literally feel the product being absorbed into your skin
you'll also notice that your skin becomes softer to the touch over time as well
it literally causes your skin to feel tighter
it is a thick oil but does sink in.
believe it or not applying this "oil" seems to have made my face less-oily over time
warm it up on your fingers first then press the lotion on your face
i live in a very dry climate
i love moisture that is not heavy
it is so great in the cold dry weather- i love the way it makes my skin feel first thing in the morning
it provides enough moisture without making my skin break out
it almost melts when you try to get it out
this does not feel heavy or greasy
i am also trying to be very careful about what i put on face because skin absorbs the moisturizer
not greasy at all.
these two dry winters in so cal have made my skin really dry
always combine this oil with my regular face cream
while it did help with my redness it didn't do much in terms of moisture
you may feel a little sticky before bed
this has now become my go to as the weather gets cold
dry skin after having a baby
does wonders for my severely dry skin
it soaks in so quickly that i would liken it to a dry oil
i did not break out or notice clogged pores- that's positive
moisturized yet it never felt greasy or too heavy to me
my t zone is sometimes dry
no night cream has done a better job so far by nourishing my skin
my skin was flaking so badly due to being unaccustomed to toronto's drier weather
you can mix this with the sos thirst quench serum for those with very dry skin
you can even mix a few drops of this into your mask
it is not greasy.
i typically find eye creams to be too greasy
it has a cooling feeling when i apply it
i wouldn't go without it in dry climate!
because it's the only cream i have used that is intended for 360 degrees around the eye
i like that it is hydrating without being too thick or balmy
it is not oily
t doesn't creep into your eyes making them feel oily
my only gripe is that it makes my eyes water from time to time
i don't find it sticky
maybe shipping in warmer weather does this?
perhaps it is a bit too rich for my summer skin.
i ended up somehow chemically burning the skin around my eyes by trying all these different eye creams that had all this anti wrinkle or lifting properties
my skin was soooo dry i was dying to put something in to soothe them
i keep coming back to this eye cream because it is so lightweight
i wish it wasn't so fragranced though because initially it did make my eyes itchy from irritation
doesnt interfer with make up
i mean very dry under eye area
i never get mila- the little white bumps or any other skin conditions under my eye
again only for someone with extremely dry undereye
products i apply usually burn my eye area
doesn't absorb right away
it is a little bit sticky at the end
the only bad thing is it runs out fast compare to other eye creams
quite expensive if i have to refill it so often.
i does not absorbs quickly for me.
not as dry as before
whenever i apply this under my eyes
ive tried numerous eye creams they would either make my eyes burn/watery
were way too greasy
theres one person who suggested applying this eye cream when the skin is still damp because this product contains hyaluronic acid
this is why having damp skin helps lock the water in
i tried applying this right after my shower with damp skin
i suggest you apply it on damp skin
i also want to try out fresh's other eye creams too :
i don't typically need an eye cream
this didn't really do much for my eyes except moisturize
my under-eye area can get pretty dry
then this is the under eye cream for you
some eye creams i've tried make it hard to apply makeup on top because they were too thick
this is the first eye cream that does not cause them to tear up
i put it in the fridge so the cream stays cold
i recently moved from a humid climate to a more dry climate
i needed an eye cream that would provide lots of moisture
lids where people get dry especially in winter weather
just rub in until it totally disappears.
this is the only eye cream i've used that is gentle enough
you can really feel the moisture
recommend keep in fridge to keep it cold.
i really like this eye cream -- as soon as you open the jar
i even use it as an eye cream.
i honestly find myself reaching for this over my other eye creams
not greasy or oily feeling.
really just needed a lightweight moisturizer to go under my make up that wouldn't feel greasy or bother my sensitive skin
it didn't cause my skin to look or feel greasy.
i feel like less creasing goes on when i've got this bad boy on underneath my concealer
the only thing i recommend when using this is letting it penetrate the skin
they sting my eyes or are too oily
i definitely prefer a product that does not sting such a delicate area
i don't think it works as well on brown sun spots
they clear out your nose
the strip is actually covered with gunk when you pull it off
the soothing strips that you put on afterwards have all of this great moisture in them so you don't feel like you're killing your nose with the treatment
i add warm water on my noise for a bit
the first patch will not work if you don't wet your nose first
make sure that it's very wet
love that it comes with a dry then a wet nose strip
shrink them from so huge you could plant trees in them
they didn't irritate his sensitive skin either.
it pulled out gunk that i didn't even know was there
it works so well when you take off the first step 1 the dry one you can see all the nasty stuff on the mask
these are the best blackhead strips i think i've ever used
it's amazing and removed all the gross oils too
my nose looked like i didn't have a single blackhead once in my life
they pull out so much gunk form your nose
i think the key is to really soak your nose with wet
definitely doesn't pull everything out of your pores
the first stripe makes you go "beurk" because it really goes into your pores
i like how it only covered my nose because that is where all my blackheads are located
i do not have an oily nose
didn't irritate or dry out my skin
it clears up your nose like nothing else
you can see all the blackheads that are pulled out on the strip
not only do you have a strip that pulls the blackheads out
it was not pleasant taking the dry strip off
it's an easy way to entertain yourself at night when you look at all the gunk on your used strip
it seems like every year my blackheads just get worse
i couldn't believe all the gunk that came out of my nose
you can see the blackheads on the actual strip which is reassuring
this is the holy grail to get rid of them totally worth it
they just dry my nose
after taking off the dry first step strip i could see that it actually extracted a lot of blackheads
after the dry strip it was so nice
have not tired any nose strips like these yet.
they get out at least 7 times as many blackheads as the biore strips
leave my pores the way they should be: clean
works great the dry strip really gets a lot out of my pores
very good at pulling out blackheads from my nose definitely a good buy if you love skincare products it was a little drying for my nose
they clear out your nose so good
i wish you could purchase just the wet patches.
i like that these have a second step to seal your pores so they don't get immediately clogged after removing the dry patch
it's hard to control the amount you put on as its so thick
so your fingers don't go in the jar.
so my guess is the warmer temperature maybe makes it "melt" into the eye a bit
seems to suck up fine lines immediately
but if you've got the dough, i recommend it!
it's a comfort to know i have an "eye safe" spf on during the day
s to turn it into an oil/balmy substance
they appear smaller and definitely less "gunky".
to get the best results you have to massage it in with water
if you just rinse it away immediately you miss out on the best parts
it seems to be just what i needed to keep my redness
only thing that gets rid of my breakouts!!
i applied a nice even layer not too thick onto dry skin as the directions said
always finish with the fresh rose face mask as to not dry my skin out after using drier mud masks
at 50 i'm so dry in the winter i have to be very careful about cleansing products making things worse
then it dries in about 5 minutes or so
my skin wasn't as oily or dry
it mad my skin burn a little
loved this treatment mask it was the first thing i have tried like it i have dry skin
it wasn't too drying
i really love this product--it definitely does not dry my skin out like most cleansers do
i love how it doesn't strip the oils from my skin
my skin type is usually dry
was not over drying or irritating to my skin at all
i am nearly 60 and still have oily skin!
it honestly smoothed them so much
for those of you with really sensitive skin that can't h
didn't dry out my skin at all.
after you wash it off your skin will feel baby bottom soft
does not dry your face out like some clay masks
when you get it wet again it become an amazing oil cleanser
dried on my face like any clay mask would be expected to
i love how it turns to an oil when you wash it off
dry up on your skin to pull out oil which is just like the other 2 they have
i also like that it is mud to oil.
couldn't find anything to moisturize enough
didn't leave my skin dry
not making it feel dry
it did help significantly with some stubborn texture
makes your skin so comfortable that it doesn't feel like you've used a harsh treatment even though this is effective
i always give my face a quick cleansing to remove any excess makeup or oil so the mask can focus on the stuff that's deep in your pores
every few weeks my skin gets pretty oily
love how it's a mud to oil treatment
you can feel it working right off the bat--makes your skin glow
not too hard or drying
i like the effects it keeps my skin in check
it did tingle my skin for the first 2 minutes or so
when i first put it on it did burn my skin a little
the one warning is that if you exfoliate before using this product it will burn
i love the feeling of the 'mud to oil' when you rinse it off
if u have extremely oily skin like mine bust have
does seem to really clean out the buildup
i usually use masks to help keep my skin from breaking out
doesn't dry out your face
you literally see the stuff come out of your pores
i only let the mud dry for 10 minutes
doesn't dry out my skin like other masks tend to do
t can be difficult for me to find something that clears my pores without making my skin red
love how my skin looks like when i rinse it off
i feel like it's working to pull out all of the toxins in my skin
when there’s always dirt you can’t see
you must apply moisturizer after as it does dry out your skin a little
my only caution is that if you have dry or very sensitive skin
now that my face is less dry
i feel like it's gentle enough to use more frequently than the other masks
you want to clean those pores out good
even in tone without drying me out
congested look i can sometimes get
i did have to dial back on this product during the winter--it was a bit strong on winter-dry skin
as it makes me look like a got a bad spray tan
so many ingredients seem to break me out
i don't find it drying or irritating
this product does not leave my skin dry even at my second week of use
i can still feel the moisture on my skin
i see a ton of reviewers complaining that it pilled when rubbing the eyes the next day or that it didn't play well with makeup
otherwise it gets sticky
the product is a little sticky
i suppose if it really bothers you you can apply your regular moisturizer or night cream on your brow bone
i would recommend putting it in the fridge!
but i just use less and let my face air dry.
plus i never get milia from this
using too much will make it feel sticky.
i never was good at shopping for eye treatment stuff because i dnt like touching my face due to noticeable winkles
if you use too much it will not absorb properly or ball up in the morning when you are putting on the morning cream
too much & it will be goopy.
a jar lasts quite a long time
this gel is not for you if your not into thick gels
don't listen to people who say lint gets caught under their eyes
the only thing i dislike about this product is that it's very sticky when it dries down
if you are often sleep deprived
it is so soothing to put on
it is a little sticky
if they don't i just use the origins ginsing eye cream which is not sticky
applying this gel before i go to sleep makes them so much better
if you are sleep deprived or have any irritation under your eyes i recommend this
it can be a bit sticky when it starts to dry
i like that it's a gel since it feels cooling on your skin
my undereyes would get so dry flaky
that's because gel is meant only for nighttime
if your worried about crows feet this is the eye gel for you
be careful if you have really sensitive skin under your eyes
the texture is a bit sticky on my finger when i go to apply it
it doesn't feel sticky
it doesn't take much and a jar lasts a long time.
it's cooling when you apply it
in the morning can still be goopy
you don't need much i usually get a small dab to do my eyes
or it can be sticky
soothing when you put it on
it may be sticky
yet doesn't dry skin out or leave it feeling uncomfortable or red
it won't do much for deep wrinkles
it can really add to your skin care routine
it takes a little extra effort to wash off just fyi
won't burn your face off
this mask doesn't make my face burn it just tingles for about 10 seconds
my skin does normally get red under the sun or when it's irritated
i typically use it in the shower since the directions say to apply to wet skin
my face gets greasy throughout the day
i do use this product 2-3 times a week since i get oily throughout the day which causes a build-up of dirt on my face
after all it is your skin which is continuously exposed for the rest of your lfie
completely ignored this pumpkin mask thinking it wouldn't work well for my skin
you can feel it working so the tingle is normal.
this mask definitely stings when you put it on.
adhere you take it out your skin fells so clean
after that no burn or tingle.
i could tell a difference after washing it off
it does burn like all other mask i've used
i could tell that it was a new layer of skin!
my face is lighter because it's so much cleaner
this jar will last forever too
give me some moisture to ensure it won't do any damage
after you wash it off
wake up with super bright healthy skin a must try get samples
wash well some beads can still stay behind i just follow with to we to make sure i'm squeaky clean
you do get a bit of a tingly sensation when you first apply it
the tingling feeling really isn't that bad after a minute or two
it tingles a bit when you first apply it
it has a nice grit as well that doesn't feel like you're about to scratch off your skin
he doesn't even wash his face.
as soon as you stop rubbing
i like this a little better than the honey mask because it is less irritating on my face
very comparable to if not better than the exfolikate scrub/mask
you have to scrub a bit
even then it still feels like there's some residue
this will last me forever because literally a pea size amount is all you need for it to pulsate
it would quickly return to it's usually uneven texture
it burns rather intensely the very first time you use it
if you're into skin care
doesn't sting or burn
even though it says for aging skin
while rinsing it off i could feel the difference in my skin
there is a little burning effect once you apply it
this does a great job polishing your skin with those little beads
when you revoke the mask you are left with glowing skin that is ready to absorb whatever product you are applying next
if this mask could only get rid of my discoloration it would be the absolute most perfect facial product i'd ever used
putting it on, it definitely burns a bit.
i usually go for the charcoal kinds
have to be extremely careful with skincare products being allergic to citrus things with that as an ingredient can break me out like the sunday riley luna night oil
however it was too much peel
i do think it helped bring up gunk to the surface of some active acne though
i love face mask because it forces me to take some downtime
this didn't burn my skin like most masks tend to do
somehow still super oily in the t-zone
i could immediately feel it start tingling
it has quickly become one of my go to masks when my face is feeling oily or like i'm going to break out
it burns pretty bad on the face
no matter how much moisturizer i used it still seemed lifeless
it basically exfoliates your face while making it easy to treat things like pimples
it does feel very warm when you first apply
everyone complaining about the burn
doesn't dry out my skin
not oily yet not really dry
it also has a good lather when applying to your face
this is definitely worth trying if you have dry skin
your in the middle of washing your face
doesn't dry me out
i read a bunch of reviews saying it dries you out
so my skin does not dry out
i would give it a 5 if it weren't so drying.
yet doesn't dry out the skin
you could also double wash
it was hard to find a face wash that was effective without drying
i don't find it drying
it doesn't dry out my skin
this product doesn't dry my skin
the only thing i noticed was that it may have left my skin feeling a little dry
it does a great job of cleansing thoroughly without over-drying
the only reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because their genius gel cleanser is still my absolute favorite
there would be no make-up or dirt on the pad
it is more on the drying side.
does a super job getting all the grime off my face
veer away from cleansers like this because i fear they will dry me out
i usually only wash my face with either st
i only use it 1x a day as it can be a bit drying.
while i wouldn't recommend this product if you have very sensitive or very dry skin
it can leave a little dry
i conditions get worse
-doesn't strip the skin-i don't have redness after washing like i did with purity-has a pump that dispenses the perfect amount for the whole face
it does not make my face red or cause breakouts
when the weather is humid
my face didn't require much at all to feel perfectly moisturized
won't clog your pores at the same 10 minutes after wearing it you feel you face is kinda blooming like a delicate flower
i do highly recommend this especially if you have oily skin at the same time you need a moisturizer
i wouldn't call it a "brightening" or "whitening" product because it doesn't make your skin lighter than you naturally should be
the cream does not make it look any more oily than it is
it does have a bit of an oily consistency to it
by day three i can see that my skin looks firmer
i will say that it can feel a bit oily at first
you should be using a toner or essence before as cream does not absorb well into fully dry skin
does give you a shiny oily feel after application
i took away a star because i feel like this should be a night cream as it takes several hours for my skin to start absorbing all the oils
i didn't think i needed the moisture
it is the only cream i have tried that will make my skin glow after using it overnight
i constantly go back to this one because no cream makes my skin literally glow the next day
does not break out oily skin.
definitely don't use it in the morning under makeup or you'll have your foundation slide off your face
doesn't have any mineral oils which you can find in some other pricey br
especially great for dry weather
just thrown them out because they were either too greasy or too thin
i live in a very dry climate
i love how it absorbs quickly into my skin with no oil or anything left behind
i can never use lotion on my face because i break out
ive noticed it does a nice job of keeping my skin smooth even after washing my face
i am not as oily
any time my skin is in a bad mood i use this
if i feel like i didn't get enough sleep i used it in the morning too i had noticed that my skin looks more plumper
great for oily skin at night orunder make up
i get compliments on skin all the time!
dry in one spot while oily everywhere else
wish i could rub it all over my body
is no longer dry
it can really transform your skin into an even
doesn't leave the skin greasy
the texture makes my skin feel like it's getting the support it needs to avoid fine lines
doesn't break out my skin.
my skin has gotten really dry during the winter
it is not oily at all
i apply it directly out of the shower then put on my moisturizer over top
other says charcoal meat?anyhow
it did help my actual moisturizer sink in a bit better
maybe it's because i apply this after toner
not sure which serum does more for my skin.
it doesn't irriate or dry out my sensitive skin.
normally i wouldn't spend so much on a serum
most either dry out my skin
it almost calms my skin because i've noticed throughout the day it is not as oily
and it does not burn my eyes.
i am skeptical of cleansing oils fearing they will leave my oily areas more so
does not dry out my skin while cleans it
i follow with ole henrickson red tea foam cleanser because i like to make sure there is no oily residue
the oil does not dry out my skin
my skin is all too happy to flare up over just about anything
otherwise i get that oily film everyone talks about
this skin care routine works for me
then this soothing oil gets to the rest
even acne wash didn't work that well for me
i can tell a huge difference when i wash my face before bed my face isn't screaming for a ton of moisturizer right away
it will burn like the dickens for a good 5-10 mins
the first time i pumped about what i would use in other eye creams
i continue to use the day cream with josie maran oil because it lasts longer for me :
u will love how it melts on your skin especially after you have prepped it
i needed something that moisturizes in spite of the wicked winter wind
although i am 46 which normally means dryer skin i still have somewhat oily skin
not too dry or sensitive
like the day cream much more
note: if you have super dry skin it might not be moisturizing enough on it's own
i can't use a lot of products as i will breakout or my skin will have dry flakes
if korres can eliminate the oily looking
i love the way my make up looks when applied over this cream
certain skin types will react or flare up
i apply it to a dry face
it may dry out your face because it is strong.
it does go on chalky..that's normal.
i don't find it to be too drying
really just enough to wet my fingers seems to be enough
you might feel a bit of burning
i've never had any lasting irritation from this product once it's rinsed off
even when waiting a bit too long to rinse
it did not harden to where it wasn't removeableremoveable or harden much at all
it does not over dry
one minute later wet your fingers to allow it to work it's magic
i would recommend putting on some facial oil afterwards because i noticed some drying which seems natural given the ingredients
because a single application can leave your skin surface feeling smooth
does not bother me in the way that artificial scents normally do
i just use a small amount of my cleanser again afterward to make sure there's no residue
definitely do a patch test
i love this treatment as it is perfect for the minor buildup of texture i get every so few days
it is like scrub when i put it on my skin
the only way i can describe it is that it smells like copper
this really helps brighten your skin when used a couple times
i like that you rinse it off instead of having to keep a sticky serum on all day
especially since it didn't dry out or react badly with my sensitive skin
i also don't think it dries my skin out either
it did not burn on my skin at all.
this product did not make my skin dry at all it actually moisturized it
then i think it may be just the product gumming up on your face
i take good care of my skin
i normally treat my skin before bed
she'd already warned me not to rub it around on my face too long
use on clean dry skin for best results.
the whole day i had no issue with excess oiliness on my skin
that it is best used on dry skin
voila my skin no longer felt like it was burning
you can use it after you oil moist
even through humidity and a long day of work!
it absorbs pretty quickly so the sticky doesn't last
can't tell any more benefit from it than i get with ibuki beauty sleeping mask x the sleeping mask is lots cheaper
it burns my eyes every time i use it
it doesn't burn my eyes
it did not irritate my skin
try to empty a bottle you'll realize that your skin condition has always been stable
whenever i rinsed my face off i immediately had to moisturize or my face felt like it was shrivelling
my skin isn't dry at all anymore
it takes so little to cover your face
at first i didn't think much of it than it was just a simple primer or lotion
this won't take the place of a moisturizer so don't skip that in your routine
this concentrate not sticky at all
not greasy at all.
tip: be sure to allow this product to dry on your face before you put on your moisturizer
i think when i used it by itself it just made my skin more oily because it was enhancing my moisturizer
even then it was dry
i normally would have break-outs or dryness during these situations
i found that i had to use a much smaller amount of my usual serums when layered over this
press it into my skin just as i would an oil
i truly can't believe how softly my makeup settles into my face throughout the day now that i'm using this
humid like i do
any moisturizer you put on top truly seems to sink in better as well
in my pores is just too good
using the oil made my skin dry!
normally during summer my face gets really oily
i could feel the tightening on my skin immediately
like many products at first it feels greasy or heavy
use as little or as much as you want depending on your moisture needs
i looked too oily
if that wasn't enough it is also red and dry.
my face has never been as smooth or moist.
would most likely use with a heavier night cream in the winter
when the weather was dry
i wouldn't recommend this to those with oily skin
it was too light for my dry skin as the weather turned colder
i don't think it would be sufficient for very dry skin
if you apply a sheer layer it is perfect
follow the directions then apply some night cream or i simply apply a thin layer
let it soak into my skin -- i even sleep in it --
so don't expect for it to harden
i will say i don't love the smell or the slight sting i feel for the first few seconds
it was still a little tacky when i washed it off so don't expect that tight feeling most masks give you
leave you with drier skin the next day
i put it on thickly let it absorb into my skin then after about a half hour rub the rest into my skin
i would say that 3/4 of the mask actually sinks into the skin
almost gel type finish by the time you're ready to wash it off
this is my favorite all time mask for moisture!
if that wasn't enough it is also red and dry.
my face has never been as smooth or moist.
it is first oily
does not leave any residue on my face at all
not good in the shower because your h
because i have combo/oily skin
i follow it with a gentle face cleanser because this stuff provides a bit more moisture than my skin needs
for those with dry skin
i don't get a greasy residue at all
i skip the dry step
then use this on a dry face
if your environment is too cold then then it tends to leave a residue that most won't like
you must use warm water to ensure that it works properly
give it a try if you have dry skin!!
it does leave a "film" on your skin though
it by no means is greasy
the only way i could see it feeling greasy to someone is if they had oily skin to begin with
my favorite part is that you can judge based on how dry your skin is
add your favorite moisturizer afterwards or don't add anything at all
!personally, with dry (and oily) skin i love it!!
just letting that moisture "film" soak in my skin overnight has done wonders
a little does go a long way with this cleanser
your skin will thank you <3 this is the most expensive beauty product that i have in my bathroom
it's great for older or dry skin.
then you add water
it's oily when you apply it
this oil like consistency breaks down your make up
this will be perfect for anyone with a dry skin type as it does a great job at leaving you hydrated
i don't feel like i'm rubbing off all the natural stuff my skin needs to be healthy
i love it way more then digging with my fingers into a jar to get my cleanser
you end up with a nice smooth oil
however at this point i tried removing it with a warm wash cloth
its perfect for when i feel to lazy to do separate steps for taking off my make up or when i want extra help getting it off or when my skin feels dry
it's not foaming, but rather like a gel oil.
for the most part this takes off probably 95% of my make-up without heavy rubbing
i love that i don't have to wet my face to get this to lather
give my skin a much needed moisture boost
does not strip your skin
doesn't make it feel too oily
that being said it takes a bit of effort to rinse off on it's own
when i'm not in a rush i take my sweet time massaging the product onto my face
even plain coconut oil would make more sense
sometimes i don't need a second cleanse
my skin tends to be on the dry side
you do have to make sure you rinse well
they also tend to have a skin drying effect
once the skin is dry take a small amount
even makes it feel less oily throughout the day than other cleansers
i feel like it leaves an oily residue behind that takes some effort to rinse off with water
i probably wouldn't of looked at this cleanser before if it wasn't in the sephora favourites kit
use it on a dry face
have had a hard time finding cleansers that don't leave my cheeks feeling tight after washing or result in shiny forehead by the end of the day
f you are the type who only cleanses once a day or has naturally oily skin i can see where you might want to give this a pass
i could never imagine dropping 38$ on a face cleanser
it needs to be put on dry skin
then taken off with a washcloth to do its best work
my skin does not feel tight after using this
i feel like i have pretty polar combination skin running from super oily in some spots
very dry in others
i need to be careful when rinsing because it can be slightly irritating to my eyes
it does not burn my eyes
at least it isn't drying
it's so creamy when you apply it to the face
you just want to keep massaging it over your face
i am noticing that my skin is not quite as dry
does not cause dryness the way some of the st
when you put water on it thats when it foams your skin feels amazing after you rinse
you must apply to dry face with clean dry h
no leftover make up.
it doesn't feel tight because it didn't strip my face of oil
this is a good cleanser worth trying if you're dry
not drying on my dry
so of course it is not going to foam
if you are oily or have combination skin
sometimes i'll go back over my foaming cleanser with this because i just love the way it makes my skin feel
it doesn't make my skin dry
it is so thick that i haven't had any leakage when i put some into a travel bottle
although we're upon winter drying season for me skin wise this doesn't leave my face feeling all tight
great for dry fall skin!
doesn't dry at all
you do have to use a towel just to gently wipe when you dry
it felt a little weird going from a gel to an oil to a milky
the scent tends to stay around for awhile
it needs to be used on a dry face
if you get it even a little bit wet
once you add water
even a little bit oily
which is fine because my skin is dryer now that i'm in my 40s
i do use it quite liberally.
it didn't irritate my skin at all or break me out
i didn't expect much as with all eye creams
finding an eye cream that doesn't burn or make my eyes water is wonderful
this amazing eye cream will treat every concerns you may have "360around the eye" a genius treatment for your eyes
you dont get the watery eyes like some eye creams give u
not only did it not burn or irritate my already irritated skin
i've noticed i get less oily throughout the day
i still can't use it daily as it makes my skin too red
calms skin in any season or climate.
if that wasn't enough it is also red and dry.
my face has never been as smooth or moist.
my skin has gone from oily to dry
leaves my skin super soft without making it too oily or breaking me out
don't have any problems with residue
it doesn't burn or sting
in the winter i put this on dry skin like a mask
let it sit for 15-20 minutes then usually wash off on the shower with a brush
would recommend this to anyone with flaky skin
my skin is dry when i do this.
it makes it so much easier to wash your face.
certain areas get very dry
it really does melt all of it away
they balance out so well so that my skin isn't oily or dry
don't have to haul my entire skin care regime around
would be great for mature or dry skin
it does leave a film on your skin
it doesn't burn or sting as long as you don't get it in your eyes
it really does melt everything away.
i apply it to dry skin
doesn't dry out my face or leave my face oily
it's even good for summer with my oily face
younger users may feel it makes their skin too oily
not at all dry or tight
yet have dry skin
because it can leave some dark residue from mascara etc
i know that's not ideal for every day use plus cleansing cloths make my eyes sting
instead of washing it off i would recommend you literally sleep on it
i love the fact that it doesn't dry my face out like other products
doesn't leave you super oily
let it soak in while i sleep
t's very important for me to clean my face thoroughly every night because i have acne prone skin
the product really melts away all the make up making it easier to wash your face
i do find i have to wash my face extra thoroughly after use since it can be tough to get rid of that oily residue
no need for double cleansing here ladies!
when your face is still damp
this will go away as soon as your face dries
sometimes feels a bit too oily when washing off
i don't like using this as a face cleanser as i find it to be a bit too oily for my liking
i never found anything hydrating that didn't irritate my sensitive skin
this is so nice to just gently rub over makeup
without burning if it gets in your eyes
doesn't feel greasy by any means
love it just as much as i did in summer when i'm oily
you can rub it directly into your eye area without a problem
when you rinse it off it does leave an oily film
it's easily removed once you dry your face
it is not too oily or too drying.
if you are a teen or in your twenties you probably should stick to foaming cleansers
was ready to return bc it initially felt really oily on my skin
i find regular makeup removers to be too drying so this is perfect
if i have a lot of dry skin
it's really important to keep wetness out of the container
i do not wet my face prior to use
once you add a bit of water
i don't have dry skin
i do not have dry skin
love that you use it on dry skin then just rinse it off
i love that i can use it on dry face.
i wouldn't use this if you have oily skin
they both feel oily after washing it off with water
it is does leave a greasy residue
i agree with other reviewers that it initially seems to leave the skin a bit "greasy" after it is washed off
it is supposed to get milky once you add water
then you keep washing
i felt like i couldn't get it rinsed off
after applying this on my dry skin
are still hesitant to cleanse with an "oil
need to apply to dry skin
i did not find that it left any sort of oily residue on my skin
'm sure i could use it as my only cleanser in a pinch
it does leave a film on your skin if you don't use a brush or washcloth to remove it though
i love slathering this on before i hop in the shower
it won't dry your eyes out like other cleaners or leave a gross oil residue
you should definitely wash your face after using this
just using your face wash won't actually get everything off your face
then when you use your face wash
you're actually cleaning your face
it is designed for you to quickly wash your face afterwards
talk about leaving your skin smooth
the consistency of the jar i received is not sticky
the trick in using it is allowing it to get warm against the skin
however i never found a decent oil cleanser that made my skin feel amazing
or worse made my skin pull when applying
i don't know about it turning into a cleansing milk with water
whereas other cleansing oils have had that happen for me
humidity can be as low as 7%
i love that this was jelly to oil because it moisturized my face so well
i live in the south where waterproof makeup is pretty necessary
a foaming one is great to take the oil off.
so decided to try their cleansing oil as well
honestly it cleanses well enough that i can easily skip the second cleansing which i some times do
it never dries out my skin or leaves it feeling greasy or slick
make sure to put some moisturizer on because i do find that it dries my skin out a little bit
not dry like most face wash
the majority of them require you to start off with dry h
take longer to wash off because i could still feel the oil on my face
a little wet is ok
if you don't know much about mineral oil
i love the fact that this cleanses my face fully
i can use this oil on a wet or dry face to completely remove all my makeup with little effort
you just rub it around your face
it almost feels like you don't even need to wash with a cleanser
it doesn't leave your skin oily
heavy duty enough that it doesn't clog my pores cuz i have oily skin
i could never get every trace of my gel liner or mascara off before
to make sure not too much oil stays on my skin
the key to a good cleanser is that your make up comes off easily
most removers are too harsh or just don't take everything off like they should
you only need one pump per face wash
i always use my cleansing oils on dry skin so that way i don't allow my pores to open up
if you're going to use a cleansing oil
i gave this product a 4 because it does hydrate the under eye so well
prices don't scare me when it comes to my skin care
it doesn't last as long as thicker products do
you may need to lightly dab a moisturizer over this product after it's had a couple of minutes to absorb in
it doesn't make my eyes water
you can tell that tightens up the skin under your eyes
it does make your eye area a bit more "fresh"
you can immediately feel the cooling
constantly worry about dry skin
i only need 2 pumps to cover my face
sunburned my face way too much in the past as well as not properly moisturizing my face when i was younger
like most murad products this is a rich/thick cream that can leave behind an oily greasy shine
not oily or heavy
my t zone is more on the oily side
you want something that is not greasy or oily
it provides a nice amount of moisture without that heavy feeling
it is not greasy
would recommend it to people with sensitive skin that leans to the dry side in winter
it's thicker than i expected but not greasy.
doesn't leave my skin greasy
getting older i needed moisture
not greasy or too heavy.
which i find very unpleasant
as the colder weather sets in
combination skin that gets oily in the t zone
no oil slick that i normally had to deal with.
not greasy at all.
my skin is so sensitive that it breaks out with any other moisturizer that i've tried
i like it because it is moisturizing without having a shiny face with a lot of gease
goes on easily and doesn't leave any residue.
while the slight chemical smell was a little off putting it doesn't last
now i can't go to bed without it on my dry
it is very tricky when choosing an item for oily skin because it often causes dehydration
hyalo gives my skin perfect moisture level without making it greasy
it does seem to soften any lines or wrinkles you have
never had that heavy greasy feel
this product was the step i needed to combat themail dull/dry skin
i love it because it gives my skin the hydration it needs yet its not heavy on the skin
i guess i'll have to get used to not worrying about my dry skin this winter
i am prone to getting more dry or when i feel dry
have to use prescription medicine for it that makes your skin super dry then you need this
in turn it makes my skin so dry that it flakes for days
it is a bit sticky
this is still sticky when i go to bed even if i've applied it at 4:00
even that is problematic if you apply it to your décolletage too- you basically have to take a sponge bath
on morning my skin doesn't feel dry
definitely recommend this for someone with dry skin
i'll use this if my skin is in need of some extra moisture
i also use this if i get sun burned
after a night of drinking it seems like your skin needs a boost
putting this mask on it gives you the hydration you need in your skin
gets a bit dry during winter
the scent is refreshing enough not to bother you before you head to bed
i am flaky dry all year around.
sun when i get home my face is beyond dry
doesn't make you wake up with stuff all over the pillow
it may be too much for oily skin
though i do feel that is hydrating as well its a bit heavy for me
i typically have the driest skin of life
i don't wake up oily
not at all greasy
which i'm trying to be careful with since i get oily in the t zone
mattifies not sticky at all
it doesn't feel oily on the skin
i wash my face like normal
if not for the fact that it breaks me out in whiteheads within hours
this product is a must have for dry skin
i feel like it helps keep my oily forehead in check
sensitive skin that also gets oily on my t-zone
i usually use it on my dryer areas
i don't get oily from this
it hard to find products that really help hydrate my skin without making it greasy too
i think normal the dry skin types can use this
if you are too oily you may not need the extra hydration
this never makes me oily
this definitely prevented me from getting dry patches during this winter
i've gone through so many moisturizes that just did nothing for my dry skin
i always use this when my skin is dry or when i'm traveling somewhere cold/dry
once applied it is not greasy or uncomfortable to wear overnight
i love this i have itchy dry skin in the winter
not greasy at all
i really struggle in the winter time with keeping my skin healthy
certain areas felt burnt because it was so dry
this is a nice mask to give my skin a break from all those
it is very dry in the winter
you will love it if you have dry skin.
this doesn't break me out or make me more oily in my trouble spots
it takes care of any pesky dry/flakey spots while providing an amazing overall layer of hydration
i even use it in the morning if i still have a little dry patch that will look even worse with makeup on top
my cheeks always get super dry in the winter
you can also use this as a day-time moisturizer if you have more dry skin
i live in a very dry climate
so are the dry patches on my t zone
it would just be to keep it as far away from your eyes as possible because it burns
not greasy--perfect middle ground with this stuff
the glamglow thirsty mud one--unsure as to which one worked better
i live in a place where its always cold and dry.
it takes away my dry spots
would recommend this to anyone with dry skin.
i find with the harsh dry winters i just needed something more moisturizing
i would recommend this product to anyone who literally needs moisture in their skin over night
to the point applying makeup over the dry skin just looked even worse
by the time i go to bed it has soaked in enough that it doesn't come off on my pillow
this more than helped my dry skin.
i normally dread moisturizer because it feels so heavy
i like that my skin pretty much absorbs it overnight
i normally have dry skin
i will have small dry patches on my face that tends to flake
doesn't work well on dry skin
i wasn't willing to switch over to liquid foundation because it feels disgusting
my skin can get very dry
during the winter i had super dry flaky skin which doesn't usually happen to me because my skin is usually oily
my skin was so dried out i was physically self conscious about what i looked like with make up on
in the winter when my skin is extra dry
most creams either make my skin too greasy or don't do enough hydrating at all
your skin will be tacky overnight
it is the only thing i found that helps my face after it's been exposed to chlorine
my skin started to dry out even more
living in such a dry climate this is exactly what my skin needed
if i have any dry flaky patches
it was the only thing that got rid of a recurring dry patch of skin under my eye
love the serum some skins take a few months to work it's not all the same
i recommend this product if your tackling your dark spots
often i do get them because of hormones
not only does it lighten the marks
it does tend to ball up if you put moisturizer over the top
i found the trick to that is to start with a completely dry face
then let it completely dry
just a little bit provides the moisture i need
it doesn't break me out or cause irritation.
i recommend this product if your tackling your dark spots
the jar can get contaminated because you are sticking your fingers in the jar each use
this stuff has a bunch of fruit extract in it
their products really just don't pick skin types
doesn't dry my face out
am always worried products will dry my skin out or make it red
any product that i can run over my eye without any burning sensation is good
it's a little drying to me in in fall/winter
not sure if it's due to the face wash or just my body changing
dries out easily if i use anything too harsh
i find that it does dry my combination skin some
it does not dry out my skin
it doesnt dry out my skin
it's great for a gentle cleanse in the morning when all i want to do is get off my heavy night moisturizer
doesn't leave your skin dry at all
still gives me the deep cleansing it needs without drying me out
gets my skin super clean but not dry or tight.
love that you apply to dry skin first!
since it's winter time i've really been struggling with the dryness
when my skin is being extra dry i'll use it at night as well
does not burn my eyes
i realize something that this product make my skin so oily
this foams up so well yet is not drying.
not tight or dry
you may not like it if you are wanting a natural or mild scent
i wouldn't describe this as moisture rich like its title
it's meant for dry skin
my past experience has taught me that if it foams it will strip your skin
i notice my skin gets dull when i skip a couple days
i see that people with oily skin problems really love this product
unlike some serums i've tried there is no film or greasiness in my t-zone
you can feel the elasticity of your skin increase after applying it
the only thing i don't like about it is that it's a pipet type tool where you have to drip the serum onto your face
have to always use toners or some kind of wipe after to make sure all makeup excess is gone after i shower
this is a great face wash for everyday it doesn't dry out my skin i love it
it doesn't break me out or irritate my skin
this product doesn't dry my face.
especially oily or combination
just good for a last cleansing after you've already cleaned the face
doesn't leave skin tight
this is a great cleanser once i tried it my skin felt like it could breathe
hasn't irritated or made my skin break out even once
if anything i would say that my skin is less dry than after i use other cleansers
i find the foam formula lasts a long time too which is nice
just wish it was more geared towards oily skin.
didn't make my skin more oily than normal
not any less oily either
this cleanser does not irritate my skin or dry it out even further
i really like this foam.
i guess this might be suitable for those with oily skin
doesn't strip away the much needed moisture my combo skin needs
it doesn't dry my skin
so far no drying of my skin
skin doesn't feel dry afterwards
make sure your face is dry when using it.
does not dry out my skin!
do not find this product too drying
doesn't dry one's skin too much
do not feel that it is as moisturizing as i would like it to be
it is non drying which is important because i have dry skin
my skin does not feel tight after washing it with this
have found my face to be less oily in the day
my face is naturally already very red- so anytime it doesn't like a product i get itchy red patches
i love the fact you can use it as a mask once a week for stronger exfoliating action
it does wonders for my combination-oily skin.
it really does deep clean without over-drying.
this is way better than the foaming "pefectly clean" by estee lauder
not the least bit dry for being an exfoliator-type product
a little goes a long way--i rub it into all wrinkle
didn't break my oily skin out
it did make my skin sting
when i saw that it truly does relieve my skin
i hope that skininc comes out with other cleansers where it lasts longer
this cleanser neither break me out nor give me red spot
it always gets the grime from the city off my face
i do not like sticking my fingers in a pot
i hate facial creams because they all make me break out at some point
i feel like it helps everything absorb better into my skin because when i wake up my skin is so soft
the combination of the two makes my skin so smooth that i can't stop touching my face
is not sticky or oily at all
regardless of the fact that my oily
i do find i'm less oily too, which is amazing.
i don't use it during the day because i already have an spf infused daily moisturizer i refuse to swap out
even in the humidity of the summer
out of no where which is weird because i'm a very oily person
used it tentatively because i thought it would be too greasy for my acne-prone skin
my skin is dry but nothing too bad.
i did however have problems wearing foundation because dry patches would show up
i recommend this to anyone with dry skin!
when you put it on it feels so dry
still need something for your skin i recommend 1 table spoon honey
voila not so dry skin anymore
if your skin is as bad as mine
i sometimes get small
almost as if it was drying my skin out
i finally found the overnight mask that isn't sticky/messy
i recently have experimented with the coconut oiltrend going around although it has worked very well on my hair my skin did not like it at all backstory on my skin i have very bad eczema
my skin tends to be really oily through my tzone
couldn't even feel it on my face until i washed it off
with the cold weather
received it in a sample bag i have really dry skin my feels so hydrated i will be buying this in the near future
my face is so much more moisturized since i started using this products
my skin has been pretty dry since its gotten cold
it doesn't feel tight from dryness
my horrible dry patches are so much better
i often get compliments on my skin
this mask is definitely more intensely moisturising than any other lotion or oil i've ever used
i usually am not crazy about gel masks
is not sticky at all
it feels like water when you apply it
fantastic mask that can be used overnight or after using peel an serum
great to leave on all day as a seal if going to be exposed to wind
love that is can be a sleep in or rinse off
love how it leaves your skin soft right after you remove it the next morning
not sticky on face
this is a great mask to give your face a boost in moisture when it's feeling or looking dehydrated
this is not for someone who has severe dry skin or has dehydrated skin from not drinking enough water
it did not irritate my skin as so many night creams do
or get on my pillow
plus it did not irritate my sensitive, dry skin.
now i just use it on my oily t-zone to control shine
my face has gotten really oily recently especially around my t-zone
after i let it dry
love it and it is so easily absorbed!
only when your skin isn't feeling the best
3 drops can have an amazing effects on your skin for a couple of days
it's very important to protect your skin from sun damage
it is not sticky or leaves any coloration like some of the other products i've tried
this is the only serum i ended up loving it really does hydrate my skin only complain is it runs out so fast it can get a little pricey repurchasing every month other than that it's a great product
it does not last super long because with 2 drops it comes out thick
i do recommend this for people with really dry skin
it not only added moisture to my skin as promised
the serum soaked into my skin well that it did not leave any sticky after feeling that i've experienced with most moisturising products
i also love how it is non-sticky
i didn't realize my skin was so dehydrated until it drank up this little gem
not sticky or greasy.
my skin don't feel so dry anymore just after 2 weeks of nightly application
or go to drier climates
i think it's because of its hydrating effects that my pores need not open bigger
i don't have to blot at all
surprisingly this serum made my face as if i had enough sleep
i like to apply this as a primer sometimes because my skin is super dry
this does make my skin a little more red at first
for me it just doesn't help my skin retain moisture throughout the day
just felt super cakey the rest of the day
just because the ren stays in my dry winter skin better
i can feel a little sticky at first
not to a point where it dries
especially because normally i have an oily face.
the consistency of the serum itself is seriously not a big deal especially if your using it under your moisturizer
dry, fine lines, really dull and i'm only 27.
whenever i feel dull i use a few drops of this stuff
you can feel it tighten a little so using moisturizer
it can feel a little "gluey" at first
i can see that this might feel a little drying in winter
my skin has never been dry while using this product
in the winter the air gets very dry where i live
makes your skin so perfect before applying any foundation or powder
a layer on first thing then press another layer on at the end right after my moisturize
i get pretty oily throughout the day so these silicone based products were just not working
it also doesn't dry my skin out.
i think it's just the makeup that it dries out a little
using it in those areas really makes my makeup look better over the scarring too
do get oily in my t-zone
i wanted a product that would help keep me from getting shiny without drying my skin out
i don't get as oily
fantastic for anyone who doesn't like using powder to touch up
this product does not feel tight at all on your skin
firms my skin without it feeling like it is dry or cracking
your fingers will feel like it is adhering to your face due to the "firming"
just loved the hydrating feeling of it so much that i had to go back to get the full size
i just would like to point out that it did leave my skin feeling a bit dry
not oily when i apply
as soon as you put it on you can feel your skin getting tighter
its basically a drink of water for your skin
not sticky at all!
you can feel the instant tightening in the skin as it firms
i also tried drinking a bunch of water in hopes of restoring my skins oh balance
the consistency can be kinda thick when you take it out of the jar
then rub it all in
i recommend applying at night so your skin can drink it in while you sleep
have the super dry
the dryness can be very difficult to tolerate
ensuring that it doesn't feel greasy on the skin
if you're looking to get a dewy look i'd recommend this
my face doesn't look so dry now
the oil balm does not make my face feel greasy
i got the gel too for the day.
i've also found that it's great if my skin peels unexpectedly during the day
not only do i wake up dewy
especially great for the dry winter.
i recommend this if you have dry skin.
s are so dry they're cracked from the cold
just getting over a cold
for those who don't like the dewy look
especially when it does keep my face from getting dry longer
it does make give your skin that slip feeling that many primers give
which is oily in the summer
gets completely dried out in the winter
it doesn't make my skin greasy
protects my skin against the harsh winds we're having right now in new york
it does make your skin shiny so use with a mattifying primer for day use or put on in the evening
just let it soak in
i would say this would work best over damp skin so you can lock in some hydration
this product is an oil that somehow doesn't make my skin feel oily at all
which used to be painfully dry in the winter no matter how much moisturizer i used
the ceramindin oil balm is now a must have for me
oily skin types might want to try the liquid instead
chicago where my face would get so dry
does not irritate my skin at all
the only thing i don't care for is when i put this on my lips it leaves a mildly strange taste in my mouth
this does not irritate my skin
the itchy dry flakes i get from cold dry winter is all gone
so this maybe one reason that it seems to be working for me as i clean my skin with a salicylic acid product beforeh
maybe consider adding a salicylic acid product into your skin care routine to see if that helps
it didn't make my skin oily or break out.
evens my skin tone so much faster than it used to take for them to fade
i don't even need to use a mosturizer afterward like with most serums
or if we've just cleansed their skin
doesn't make you feel dry or sticky
it did not leave any residues
it's also great about not drying my skin
a quick makeup remover or when i am too lazy to wash my face in the mornings
f you do feel the residue
it does not feel oily or heavy.
i can be rather lazy when it comes to my skincare routine
even then my skin feels dry after washing
this product does clean the skin well
most of products i use make me break out or make my face red with irritation
worth the money because it doesn't irritate my skin as other toners have done in the past
it's the product that got me back into being diligent about washing
it takes off the top layer so the cleanser can do a better job at getting deeper into the pores
don't wash it off
this is mild enough to use it everyday
i do not even need to wash my face sometimes after cleaning make up with it
whenever i want clean skin
i swear it helped even out my skin tone as well.
gentle enough to apply on your eyes.
doesn't leave any weird residue
i noticed that when i cleansed my face in the morning i seemed to be stripping off a lot of the moisture
other great nutrients i put on the night before
if it still gets rid of dirt on my face after my clarisonic
i still see there's residue on my face
i heard water facial cleansers were a big hit in korea so wanted to get one
then use another cotton pad to wash your face so you don't cover up your face with erased eye make up
deally you've already washed off most of what's already on your face
since a lot of the day's grime tends to gather there for me
i didn't realize how much was still left on my skin even after i cleansed
you only need a little bit on a cotton pad
it never leaves me feeling sticky or like theres any product on my skin
every time i use this product it feels like i just deep cleansed my face
it does not irritate my skin
it's pretty alarming what can still get left behind when you think you've scrubbed everything off—sometimes i end up using more than one cotton pad
sometimes i follow up with a salicylic toner if it looks like i have a breakout coming on
this one is gentle enough that i don't need to rinse my face afterwards
it didn't dry out my skin
sticky feel after using it
one con: it does sting a bit though
there are some nights where i just physically can not bend over a sink to wash or rinse my face to take my makeup off
use this same product on my eyes because it is gentle enough
clean- not greasy or tight
it leave a slight sticky feel after using it on it's own
it does not disturb or cause any stinging or burning to my sensitive
i don't wash it off when i'm using it as part of my mourning routine as there's less foreign material on my skin
are trying to avoid that dry
i hate most make up removers because they either 1 don't work or 2 are greasy
i still have to wash my face afterwards because this doesn't get into pores on its own
i've used the micro-water without rising it off afterward which i can tolerate
i think it would be great for all skin types since it's a magnet for pore-dwelling residue that even really good cleansing doesn't seem to get
plus it doesn't dry out my skin
doesn't dry my skin like regular water.
i apply it over my whole face with a cotton pad
this doesn't irritate or dry me out
it does not dry out my skin.
clean without any need to rinse it after using it
i don't know how it's different from other cleansing waters
that way i can be sure that my face washing is really penetrating deep into my pores
that no impurities are getting in the way
even though it looks like ordinary water
doesn't dry out my skin
you'd be surprised on how much residue is left on your face even after you've washed it well
it won't dry your skin out either
it doesn't make it feel greasy
helps make my skin become less oily through out the day
it keep my skin oil free and brighten up!
but not too thick.
totally oil slick in summer
dont know if im able to wrap my head around the price- note: lotus face cream by fresh is amazing for redness
it doesn't weigh skin down at all
i live in a very dry
in the winter my skin gets super dry so this is amazing
it was making my t-zone super oily
for whatever reason it made my skin oily
n will always have a jar of this on hand!!
that's more than twice the amount you usually get when purchacing any kind of face cream
of course there is a bit or residue on my face
especially with the cold weather coming in this is a must
have never found a heavy "mask" night cream that will work for me
it doesn't soak in completely which concerned me at first
i like that i can feel it on my skin when i wash my face in the morning because it's a reminder that i've been hydrating all night
which has seriously dried out my skin
even with the weather being warm it can be troublesome
washing off hasn't been a problem for me.
i do find it a bit sticky on my face
the excess product was very easy to rinse off too
its the only mask i have ever found that doesn't irritate my skin after use
just a warning-- it does first feel as if it is greasy
so soft i couldn't stop touching my face
it didn't feel greasy or oily
not oily at all
the mask is not sticky at all
i wonder if fresh knows that it can actually heal poison ivy
ready for me to apply my bb/cc cream without feeling like there's too much on my skin
i didn't like some of the ingredients such as the corn oil
my skin is water sensitive so being able to put this mask on
so a generous amount doesn't mean to slather your entire face with it
applying a generous amount makes me break out.
on occasion i do get really dry skin in the winter
then i felt what others wrote about it being slippery/greasy
most creams soak in immediately with the dry feeling returning all too soon
i can see how it may be a bit heavy for those with acne prone skin
it's not supposed to be lathered on like a clay mask
because of my light use
if i can find a smaller jar i intend to scoop some out with a plastic spoon to keep it fresher
is that it leaves the skin looking quite greasy after application even though it's not greasy to the touch
what i found as soon as you apply is that is softens your expression lines
the retinoid level in them usually just makes the area around my eyes dry
doesn't dry or irritate my sensitive skin either.
taking a tiny dab at a time making sure not to waste
you want your face to be as smooth as a baby's
i only use this cleanser 2 times a week otherwise it gets too harsh because i have sensitive skin
not to mention botox for that area runs around $400 each time
it can be drying
it doesn't pop up when you pump out product
it has a nice cooling effect on my skin afterwards
then i use a scrub to get out any extra dirt or oil
it works for me because i have oily skin.
don't use this if you have dry skin
you put it on your face dry
then get your face wet
i actually had to cut down on some of the other oil control products i use because together they dried it my skin
i barely get oily anymore
although if you have dry skin this might not be the best product as it does tend to remove most of the oils from your skin
can happily say that i have found the perfect cleanser for my super sensitive
my face is less oily throughout the day when i use this
i highly recommend this face wash for people that have oily
didn't dry me out or make me oily
keep in mind that your skin will get worse before it gets better
i really notice a different in my skins complexion as well as it looking less clogged with blackheads
amazing if you have oily skin!
the only downside that i see to this cleanser is that i can't really use it at the end of my shower like i usually do because it needs to be applied to a dry face
nor has it excessively dried out my skin
cool when you use this
also, i have oily skin and i breakout a lot.
my skin is more oily than usual
i don't think it overly dries out my face
i will say that because it starts as a charcoal color
the mud gets dried while in the pump then it'll be difficult to dispense it
does foam up quite a bit
it doesn't dry out your skin!
i would definitely not recommend this to people with dry skin
it may work for people with dry skin
super clean my only complaint would be that it does dry my skin out a bit
when you combine it with water
it doesn't leave me dry or oily.
this product is best for people who have oily skin rather then someone who has dry skin
because this is the only cleanser to ever take care of my ance without drying my face out
this actually helped get rid of my dry patches as well as my ever constant acne
not good enough to get my skin back on track
all i have now is a little texture left
it can be a little drying
the pump on the smaller bottle tends to get stuck tho
at first it was a little drying
definitely would not recommend daily use if you have dry skin because it is so drying
it does dry your face at first
did not dry my skin out
i do not find it dries my skin
normally i'm bad about cleansing my face
i think this would be good for oily skin
it's maybe a little too drying for my normal skin
i'll probably switch to something a little lighter like fresh's cleanser
soft skin without the drying itchy effect other products can give u
only criticism is when washing off it is a bit messy
i took a star off because it's a bit too drying on my skin in winter
dry my skin out even worse
s add a bit of hot water
the pump can get stuck sometimes
which is good for someone that has dry skin like me
my face is less oily.
if your skin is like mine
not messy or oily.
easy to apply and clean off.
it hasn't made my skin dry out at all
youll get a refreshing feeling i use a scrub on my face face instead of using my h
it makes my face dry if i use it twice a day
i found that this product really dried out my skin
i never thought i'd see the day because my skin is super oily
it does not dry out your skin or leave it feeling oily
making it really feel like you're getting into your pores
get rid of the dry patches on my skin
it's a light duty product that helps keep the effects of deep clay masks much longer without having to sit around for half an hour
for having dry skin i can get awfully shiny with certain cleansers
i usually switch up my cleansers often for the next best thing
is not too harsh on the dry patches on my face
you can literally feel that it's cleaning your pores while you are rubbing it on your skin
you apply a thin layer and let it do its magic.
have had dry skin my whole life
i did not smell it until i put the oil on my face
great for dry skin or for nighttime for other skin types
my face was extremely dry due to the cold weather
this oil is perfect for dry season especially for winter time
my skin could not survive another winter without it
it helped me get through the ny office dry heat in the winter
will continue to use it for my normal/dry skin with occasional ecezma
i can feel the moisture
the only thing that hydrates my face sufficiently during the winter
it's supremely hydrating now that dry winter air is already starting to mess with my skin
no greasiness all dry patches are gone within a couple of uses
it can be used alone or under your other night-time moisturizing products
this oil is a non-negotiable if you have dehydrated skin
my skin can enjoy the rich
i apply this dry.
i apply it to dry skin
use a different cleanser i always regret it because my skin just isn't the same
it comes off easily leaving little to no residue
it's it the only oil that nourish your skin without leaving any greasy residue
i can actually swim in a pool now without feeling stinged in my face
goes on like oil
a half pump usually does the trick.
it doesn't burn or dry them out
it won't be emusified super quickly once you splash some water
it was still too greasy
once i wash it off my face is soft
softens my dry skin to the point where i don't need to exfoliate as often to get the same result
final verdict-almost perfect except it can make my eyes water after rinsing
it's stuck until you push really hard then squirts out too much product
get rid of any dirt or oil that built up overnight
the only reason why i didn't give it 5 stars is because its very heavily scented with essential oils which can be extremely cloying at times
you only need 1-2 pumps
as soon as you wash it off your face is soft
it is not drying
i tend to use it more when my skin feels off balance or just dull
i also feel like it doesn't strip the skin while cleansing
with this being in a glass bottle alot of product gets left unused because you can't get it out
it leaves a cooling effect on your skin which i love about it
it doesn't get all my makeup off since i used my toner afterwards
i apply it to dry skin
i love the cooling effect an the smell your left with is so relaxing
it doesn't strip the skin which is great
you don't have to use a ton of product to create an even layer to leave on as a "minute mask" i like to use a hot damp towel to stem my face first to open my pores
i apply this to dry skin
because i do find it a bit drying if i use it too often
i like to use it on dry skin with a couple of pumps
really work it into the skin
get a bit more of an oil finish
i don't allow it to suds up on my skin at all
so don't waste product by having super wet h
once you work it around your skin it turns very oily
when i wash it off
how much moisture it has now
you cannot treat your skin if you have a layer of make up on
then you will add a little water to your h
pull things out to the surface
one of the first things i did was swap out that awful charcoal face wash from boscia for this
t doesn't feel drying to my skin
removing one star simply because this is quite a bit to spend on a cleanser
the scent can cause my eyes to sting if it gets too close
i do not use this twice a day as recommended because i find it a tad drying
i need that drying
it's a bit drying for my skin which is what i expected since it has clay
never really feeling the power like the ones with harmful chemicals
a word to the wise: try not to get it on your lips because it tastes awful
it can 'flake' if i rub my skin after applying
so far it's been fine for me in the cold dry season as well
never really felt the need to moisturize a lot
my skin started getting really bad dry patches
it does absorb quickly for me
it does not irritate my skin at all.
while not aggravating my oily t-zone
i can smell it even after i apply it to my face
not greasy at all
have these little bumps under my skin that you can't pop
my face would feel greasy throughout the entire day
so refeshing when you put it on and not oily!!
doesn't make my face look oily
this moisturizes so well without being too thick or heavy
it does the job without leaving my skin oily.
it is either to heavy
does not leave an oily or slick feeling on the skin
look for a light product that doesn't leave my face greasy
also takes care of those dry places
not too heavy, not too light, just right!
doesn't make me oily which is hard to find
is not in the least bit heavy or greasy
it really helped with my dry patches
is super moisturizing without any greasy feel leftover on your face or h
this is the only moisturizer that won't make her face turned red
didn't make me feel oily
i would recommend it to people with normal to dry skin
many other high-end moisturizers either made me break out or i felt like a grease-ball when i woke up
this doesn't leave me oily
a lot of people say it burns
i find that it does burn if it gets in an open cut
it never feels greasy or heavy
the only thing is that i either have to add more layers or put another deep moisturizer on top because it doesn't moisture as much as i want it to
i've made peace with the fact that i need to layer more than one moisturizer in order to really bring my skin to normal
i prefer a heavier-feeling cream bc the skin around my eyes gets very dry
not heavy or oily
some days it’ll be as oily as an oil slick
day if i’m more on the dry side: the water cream.
even oily skin can use this as well since oil products actually can help the skin produce less oil
i usually use it in the morning or as a second cleanse because i don't feel like it totally gets my waterproof mascara off
it doesn't leave an oily film on my skin
a little hard to wash off because of its oil texture
didn't break me out or irritate my skin.
first cleansing oil i have tried, but i love it!
i do use three pumps as i noticed two wasn't enough to get rid of my mascara
it melts your make up off as soon as you start applying into your face
even all the hard to get off eye stuff
i love how well it cleans my make up off.
you need a dry face
you put this stuff on a dry face with dry hands.
best part is that there is no oily residue after you rinse off
when you wash it off with warm water there's nothing left
my skin didn't feel stripped or have a oil residue
i usually use it with a facecloth
if my skin is feeling sensitive i splash it off with water
i do not use it on the parts of my skin that are extremely acne prone
i first need to say that i am extremely lazy when it comes to facial cleansing
i typically buy wipes of some kind
it does not leave your face the least bit oily
they either dry me out or leave a film on my face
does not dry out my skin
i would recommend this to anyone who has combination skin to dry skin to wanting something luxurious feeling on their face at the end of the night
i also find that you don't have to rub your lashes too hard
i especially like that you apply the cleanser onto dry skin
just put the oil on a dry face
this oil does not leave me dry
it does not leave a sticky feel
you don't feel that dried out feeling you get from a lot of cleansers
isnt too greasy the only other cleansing oil ive tried is the precleanse by dermologica
my normal cleaning oil is a tad bit gritty
i really like this cleansing oil because it softens my skin in a big way
one of the many issues i tend to run into with oil cleansers is that they don't wash away as cleanly as i like
i don't do liquid eyeliner much so perhaps that is where the complaint is from
so was worried it would feel heavy or would not clean my skin
i've never been super big on the oil cleaning method just because i feel that my nighttime routine takes much longer when using a cleansing oil
the oily texture that you apply to your dry face is
dry face there is no mess
i never liked the oil remover products that you have to wipe away cause it feels icky
when i wake up any texture
you put the product on your face dry
it doesn't dry it out
this is the first oil i've tried that didn't leave some sort of film on my skin after rinsing
when you add water
i am just curious as to if it's safe to leave on the skin since it says rinse
the texture of it when you're massaging it into your skin isn't even oily like you would expect it to be
it doesn't leave a greasy residue after you wash it off
1 or 2 drops is enough
no matter what cleanser i use i feel tight
does not strip my skin
does not leave any residue
it is low maintenance in that you apply it to dry skin
i now only have to exfoliate with my clarisonic once every couple of weeks which is insane for me
it removes almost everything off my face with out over drying it or irritating it
it never leaves my skin burning
clean without irritating it
i sometimes put this on my dry face
sometimes i wet my face first then apply it
less red just by washing my face with these 2 products
this does not upset my dry sensitive skin at all!
saw that it wasn't cleaning my skin enough
would get it realy clean before i put an ointment on it
i happen to love oil cleansers because i feel that they do not strip my face of my oil reserves that i so desperately need
it dried my skin out so much that immediately after
surprisingly clean without drying me out
you put it on dry skin
there's absolutely no oily residue left behind
without being oily at all
wonderful product if your skin isn't heavily oily to begin with
it still feels soft after i rinse it off unlike harsher cleansers which makes my already dry skin even drier
there is always makeup residue on it if i use this product alone
and so gentle i can even use it on eyes.
it saved my dry winter skin
i highly recommend this oil if you want extra hydration
love how it doesn't have a sticky oily residue or feel
i apply one drop of oil on my skin
i do not use the oil since things look a little greasy
have not left my combo skin feeling or looking oily at all
drying i had enough
i struggle with dry skin
using this oil has helped my face a lot while not irritating my skin
this product would be ideal for combo/oily skin as doesn't offer much hydration for my normal/dry skin
rub it on my lips in the morning if they're feeling dry
the consistency of this oil isn't sticky
oil has the tendency to also make you feel greasy afterwards
this oil actually helps to stop my skin from overproducing excess oil of it's own
have normal/dry skin by the way
i know it's not marketed in any way as making your eyelashes grow
especially if you have dry skin
from just normally dry skin
i've never felt greasy or oily.
the oils balance your skin so you don't produce excess oil
t will have time to fully soak into my skin
i especially use it when my skin gets very dry during the long minnesota winter
regardless the fact that have dry skin
this has not been easy in the dry vegas air where i reside
is not greasy at all
in the morning i don't wake up feeling like a greasy hot-dog
you can add extra later if you want a bit more sheen
will make you look like an oil slick
i never thought to try a facial oil
oils usually break me out
doesn't need much in the way of extra moisture
normally oil makes me feel greasy
if you aren't as dry as me
unless you have really dry skin
i noticed i'm not quite as oily
doesn't leave your face greasy ... which i love!
it has been a life saver for my dry winter skin
i wake up with a nice glow that i don't wash away
during the day when my skin feels a little dry
i think it might actually heal them faster when used in combination with the pink topped serum
if you use too much it definitely leaves a greasy residue
this was way way too sticky
the oil is too much moisture while the b hydra gel is too little for my skin
only use at night though because it takes a bit to soak in
i do not experience any dry patches on my face which is good news since the weather is now cold
if you need a little extra moisture just add a drop of two of this to any product for a little extra moisture boost
the dry parts of my face go back to being dry
as the seasons change my skin becomes more combination/oily
i still struggle with excess oil in my t zone
however it's not as bad as it used to be so my fear of creating oilier skin was unfounded
this is the perfect amount of moisture for my oily t zone
this stuff really helps calm my skin down when i make it cranky by eating too much junk
it is not greasy
now that cold weather is here
this is the only oil that's helped provide some moisture to it
or all alone for those dry skin days
amazing oil that does not break out my skin.
it also felt like i was applying a vegetable oil or something
the oil wasn't heavy like the others
love this for my dry patches it pretty much works over night
i doesn't feel oily
the only thing about this product that is inaccurate is that it absolutely leaves an oily or greasy residue
this oil is light without feeling like a true "dry" oil
am not very oily anymore
i think the oil is just two heavy on my pores.
i find it a little less greasy/heavy
i feel like it's a nice break for my skin because is 100% all natural marula oil
if you get sunburnt put this on before you go to sleep literally anywhere on your body
haven't experienced super oily skin either
i mix 3-4 drops into my night time moisturizer rather than applying directly to my face
some didn't entirely sink in/absorb
nourishment for dry skin that i haven't experienced with any other type of oil
though i can see how it may make oily skin too greasy leading to breakouts
if i'm not too dry
what i like most is that this heals your skin with just one use
this will change your skin care routine!!!
worried it may cause me to burn easier
if you turn bright red from the glycolic it's because you're using something else that has sensitized your skin
i thunk this would be perfect for oily skin as my oily areas seem to react well to this
using this product every night doesn't burn or irritate my skin
i don't even wear foundation or powder anymore
this serum is great for those who are trying to even out the texture in your skin
i got a travel size of this to test it out since i have sensitive dry skin
in some areas it's very dry
my skin is way less oilier than it used to be
i looked like the smoothing filter on snapchat i am not even exaggerating lol
i can imagine it won't sting for those that regularly use stronger washes
it did not over-dry or give me any burning sensation
congestion in my skin i make sure i wash
not dry or oily
i no longer get oily
this product does so well controlling my oily face
especially during the day when it progressively gets oily
honestly my pores are almost gone now
it makes your face just super fresh
i did notice when i used it straight on my face after washing it did cause irritation so make sure your skin is dry
also for me personally i mix it in with marula oil
can get away without using a primer if i moisturize really well
oily skin will love this product though
it dosnt absorb into my skin it kinda leaves my face feeling sticky
i'll take a bit of stickiness at night if i'm going to wake up with dreamy skin
can't wait to try it out on my arms as well since i have keratosis
not sure what it is about this glycolic acid that my skin responds to so much better than others
i couldn't use the same stuff as when i was a teenager because it caused irritation
i've tried so many products in an attempt to get rid of texture
didn't dry it out
it cleans well and does not dry out my skin.
i never thought that my pores could vanish!
50% of my pores on one area shrinked so much that they are not visible anymore
i don't notice that this is too drying even if i don't use a moisturizer
it didnt dry me out at all
making my skin dry or anything
unhealthy despite plenty of water
i do get the occasional hormonal break out
does not leave any residue
this is the first bar of soap i've ever used that doesn't strip my skin of moisture
it gets all the make up off without drying my skin
the only drawback is that it doesn't get all eye make up off so you still need eye make up remover
it's one of the few cleansers i've tried that doesn't leave my skin really tight
use it less frequently because i like to limit the amount of physical exfoliation i do
far less oily, too!
a must-try for oily skin!
does not leave my skin feeling dry or itchy as many bar soaps do
really cleans my sensitive skin without any issue
for someone who is always on the go this is a great option for when you want a cleanser that is great for your skin unlike many stripping bar cleansers
i love this product because it's a great basic cleanser that doesn't leave your skin feel tight or dry
i love this bar because it allows me to fully cleanse my face
doesn't dry it out
my skin gets drier than i'm used to dealing with
doesn't leave my face feeling super dry after use like other cleansers do
this "soap" has not bothered my skin at all
i no longer need to exfoliated twice a day which is unheard of
t would keep the bar dry
doesn't dry my skin
it's not drying at all
if you already have dry skin
some really dry areas and an oily t zone.
i am usually not a face soap person because i find leathering up your facial wash is troublesome when you can just squeeze them out from a tube instead
t's like using a very thick cleansing milk if it makes any sense
i actually see this face wash really working into cleansing my pore
after washing off my face doesn't feel dry at all
i can see all the pores are so clean
it doesn't burn my eyes
i ended up buying this one instead because it seems to help with dryness
make sure to store it/ let it dry on a soap dish so none of the product goes to waste
made my combination skin perfect without drying it out or leaving it oily
i just wise it didnt feel so dry
the way i usually use this is to wet my h
i don't wet the soap itself directly
i get the soap itself wet
it doesn't dry out my skin
i wrote another review about how the marula oil helps calm my skin during the hot summer months
once i learned that balancing my ph levels was the cure for my oily
the pekee bar however is a bit more gentle as it does not have the exfoliating bits in it
i also get dry patches easily in the oily areas
use just enough water on my face to rinse it off so there's no visible soap
i made the mistake of rubbing my face to hard when rinsing which made my face feel "squeaky clean" which i didn't want
it does burn a bit
my face does not feel dried out after using this bar
doesnt make me dry or break out
this one truly does not strip or dry the skin.
tend to steer clear of bar soap
any cleanser that might strip my skin too dry
i prefer using this one regularly to the juju bar because that one has fine granules in it
that tend to irritate my skin if i use it regularly
at times seemed a bit drying
it gets everything off without over drying
i just want something that removes my grime at the end of the day
i take my skin care routine very seriously
the only thing is that it does strip my spray tan rather quickly
as long as you don't feel it drying your face on like the 3rd or 4th cleanse
if you do experience some sort of drying component
i'd say stop before you end up like me -- where the oiliest part of the face is now the driest
love my skin after and it doesn't dry me out.
flakey on my chin that i decided to give a new product a try
it does help calm down my skin
t does not dry or hurt like some other cleanser that i have tried
does not dry out my skin
it did not get a 5 stars cause it did cause some dryness after use
foamy on your face which is something i like
you can feel the skin tighten after
etc are very drying for my skin
i suppose you could also just brush your clarisonic over the soap bar
this soap doesn't make my face feel dry or tight.
you don't want your soap to sit in water
don't keep it in the shower.
i wet both the bar
doesn't leave a film or make my face dry
if it gets wet it will get messed up.
doesn't leave your skin with that tight drying feeling i'm also using estée lauder advanced night repair along with this
i kind of wanted something that lathered for my second cleanse
so far it doesn't dry out my skin
it's literally the first cleanser i have ever used that doesn't make my skin feel tight or dry afterwards
it does not dry out my skin
never dry or tight
not tight or dry at all
that it doesn't leave a film on my face like other bar soaps
i love that it doesn't dry out my skin
it doesn't dry my skin out
does not irritate or make your skin feel dry
didnt work for me they were drying
it's hard not to have outkast playing in your head after washing with the juju bar
i'd much rather have a liquid i could easily pump out of a bottle
it's a smooth lather than feels like clay at the same time
i don't find it dries out my skin
needed a face soap that would not dry my skin
it's also drier than usual
doesn't leave your skin dry or tight, no residue.
i quickly realized my skin does not tolerate twice daily cleansing
it does not leave your skin feeling tight like a normal soap bar
it definitely keeps my oil at bay longer than other washes do
it did not dry my skin out at all
everyday i would wake up with the same flaky dry spots
it doesn't even leave your face feeling that tight dryness after some exfoliants
i think it was just adult acne starting to grow onto me
it doesn't dry the skin
t's not sitting in any water
not dry or tight after i cleanse
use that to really get my skin clean
not stripped dry after i wash it
then lightly everywhere else
"do i lather it up
or, do i rub the bar all over my face?"
realized that the bar was doing it's job by bringing impurities to the surface
that it isn't drying
it's not drying at all
i would've never thought that i would have to exfoliate in the morning with this bar
some soot residue always seemed to remain almost a week later until i got juju
even with my combination skin back normal
this maybe better suited for everyday use on someone with combo to oily skin
i love how it doesn't dry my skin out
lasts a long time since it does not take much for it lather up
i just splash my face with warm water
it says wet the bar
so that may be why so many find it drying or over-exfoliating
this didn't dry me out at all
in fact it leaves a kind of moisture film on the skin
it rinses away without making my face feel dry or tight
sometimes i use it with my boscia sponge other times i just use my h
no matter how many times i used this in the day it doesn't dry out my skin or make my face feel tight
completely gets rid of the tiny little flakes of dry skin on my face if i have any
is not too abrasive if you work the product into your h
because i thought it would dry my skin
i hope it is not damaging to my skin
i do not rub the bar directly on my face
if not i lather it in my h
if anything it has helped calm some existing buggers
it is a little scratchy when you put it directly on your skin
i find my skin does ok with direct contact to the bar except it hurts a bit on my forehead
'll rub it on my h
then give my face a nice rub/scrub
not dry or tight
ifyou have sensitive skin i'd do the pekee bar
my habit was to just rinse my face with water in the morning because i thought it best to minimize anything that could be drying
i find it leaves my face slightly red if i use it that way
sometimes my skin can react to certain products
apply to my face i can still feel those grains
i like using it like this better because when i just use the lather it doesn't feel as exfoliating
the only thing is that it's hard to find a spot to put it after i'm done using it because it's a wet bar of soap that sticks to the counter if i leave it there
it got rid of all of those dry patches
then apply only the lather to your face
if you are finding this too abrasive i can imagine it is possibly from rubbing the bar on your face
it does not strip the skin nor does it leave behind any residue
i will say tho the exfoliating beads or whatever is in this bar are very harsh
then applying to the face not using the bar directly on your skin
i kind of wish they made the bar with out the exfoliation that's why i took off 1 star
well my skin tends to get oily throughout the day
i would suggest not putting the bar directly on your face as it is pretty abrasive
it is really only detectable when you use it directly on your face
all my cleansers were just not cutting it because they were drying out my skin
it got rid of my dry patches
i no longer have dry patches on my face.
i recommend this to anyone with dry or sensitive skin
other than that my skin is not dry or irritated at all
i recommend this to even you combo/oily girls
you can feel how abrasive this bar is
if i do to much to it it can get super dry or super oily it never seems to be ok until my daily routine with this soap
doesn't feel greasy or turn your face into an oil slick
doesnt break me out, which most oils do.
i feel like my skin just drinks this up.
as of right now i have a bad cold
have been blowing my nose like crazy so of course its dry as heck
it burned so bad i have to wash my face right away
during the day i find the elixir a little too heavy with my makeup
do not mix with moisturizer so the product can really sink into your skin
if you are looking to mainline moisture into your skin
t does leave an oily residue
feels like dry oil
sensitive skin people have been duped into thinking all scents are bad for skin
only negative is that i do find it takes awhile to sink in to the skin
does not sit on top of your skin to make a film like many other anti-aging products
my skin would have been a dried out
doesn't even feel like an oil and sinks right in.
it is a dry oil so my skin does not look greasy at all
i really try to stay away from fragranced products on my face
if this was unscented it would be very good!
is somehow less oily during the day
i would use this product on my skin for the scent alone
it will not leave your bedding destroyed
this cleanser is literally so bomb like i went it for something i could actually wash my face with cuz i don't really have any facial cleansers
does not strip my skin
usually anything that foams is too drying for my face
any type of face wash makes my face burn
it's just an all around need to have face wash
not dry or oily it's perfect
i am usually fearful of foaming cleansers as they usually leave my skin super dry
would recommend anyone with dry skin to use this
from the moment you start to cleanse your face you will see how soft
i would extremely recommend this face wash.
since i tend to be very oily
i never feel like i have to put lotion on my face immediately after washing like i have with other face washes
leaves my skins so nice afterwards every time
protect my combo/sensitive skin incase the clarisonic was too rough
the only thing i dislike about it is if it is your only cleanser that you use you start to get a build up in your eyebrows where it doesn't completely rinse away
t doesn't dry out or irritate my skin
it didn't irritate,dry or make my skin red.
it's gentle enough to not over strip my skin's natural oils
doesn't leave my face tight or dry
as a personal preference i don't like too much lather because those seem to make my combo/oily skin dry
it now seems that its the only cleanser that doesn't give me an allergic reaction
i get so many compliments on my skin with i'm not wearing make up
dry skin at all
it doesn't dry out my skin or mess with my ph levels
it's very foamy does not dry out skin or give you that tight feeling after you wash your face which i hate
lots of products burn when i put them on.
think aquaphor to try to keep the dryness at bay
everything i put on my skin was making it burn
i also love foam, can't get enough.
was sensitive to my other face wash
i assume that it will be good for all types of skin since it is moisturizing enough for dry skin to be more refreshed
highly recommended to people with dry skin since it's not drying at all
best part, my skin isn't dry after i was my face.
actually dried out my skin more
i feel like a cleanser that doesn't foam also doesn't clean your face very well
yet doesn't leave your skin feeling like it has an oil layer after washing
it does not make my skin oily nor does it dry it out
since i use this face wash it doesn't weigh down my face or makes me look tired my face h
nice for the morning when you don't need a deep cleanse
doesn't dry out my skin or anything.
a little goes a long way so this isn't a cleanser requiring a gob of product to get the job done
doesn't dry my face out
doesn't make my skin feel squeaky or dry
if you're concerned with dry
it cleared up all my problem areas right away even though i'm not keen on skin products with fragrance it does smell nice
not so much that i feel it is stripping my skin
decided to buy a full size because i loved how soft my skin felt after washing it with this
fragrance as these both can irritate the skin so this may not be gentle for everyone
alcohol is so horrible for your face
why add something that strips your skin so badly
very dry in the winter
it doesn't make my skin feel dry at all.
it doesn't make my oily skin feel
residual water stays in there when you close the cap
it did not dry my skin out or leave my skin feeling tight like most cleansers do
also really helped my skin from getting too dry
from getting too oily through out the day
when i first tried this i didn't think it has enough cleansing power since it feels very creamy
doesn't dry my skin out
even though i have oily combination skin
it's non-drying on my face.
as i don't feel like they really cleanse my skin well
nor do i care for the greasy feeling after i rinse
i mean everything — dry
occasionally i follow up with a cream remover if i don't want to scrub too much
some cleansers are terrible when they get in your mouth
it does not dry my skin anymore
i don't usually spend this much on face washes
general yuck of the day without drying out my dry skin
my skin tends to be a bit on the oily side at the end of the day
my skin doesn't feel tight or dry after using it.
so much less oily
take your time massaging it into your face
rub it in really well
it does foam up a little bit
have a container in all places i wash my face.
after i rinse it's off it makes my face have such a beautiful glow
it works well with my crazy normal to dry combo skin
it doesn't dry me out but helps combat my pores.
this is nice because there's no need for excessive scrubbing or rubbing or pulling
it doesn't dry out my already dry skin
making it feel dry
this doesn't break me out or irritate my skin since it is very gentle
what i love about this is my skin feels full of moisture
didn't dry my skin or irritate it
it does not dry the skin
honestly healthier than it was before i put that horrid exfoliant on my face
i put this on my damp face
i am not a fan of foaming cleanser as they tend to run down my arms when i wash
this does not dry my face out at all
any cleanser that claims more than that is just money down the drain
the cotton round never had any leftover residue
as i find it too thick for my oily skin
as it doesn't further dry out my already-parched face
i simply rub it into my typically fully made-up face
it does leave a bit of residue
it is not greasy
i usually end up with a cleanser that is too rich
it breaks me out or too drying
it does a great job without drying the skin
it doesn't leave the skin dry or dull
this stuff is gentle enough to off my tons of eye makeup without harmign my eyes
the only negative: it does not remove all of my makeup unless i work it into my skin with warm water
if i use this product first i have way less make up residue left on my face than compared with my make up remover wipes
it doesn't dry my skin out
don't get that dry
i actually had to check my face again because i'm so used to cleansers making my face feel stripped afterwards
it doesn't even take much to wash your face.
ill never use another eye make up remover so this is perfect for my face
they trigger my blethritis condition to act up making me look like i have pink eye by morning
it is so easy to wash off
it doesn't dry my skin out or add unnecessary oils at all
there's no chance of drying out
it actually did take care of my puffy
so they both got same amount of cold compress action
the product leaves a cooling effect on your eyes for about 10 mins after so you know it is still working regardless
warms up too quickly so by the time you finish applying to one eye
even though its pricey it doesn't take much of the product to calm the puffiness
this stuff is unlike any other "eye cream"
for some reason some concealer a tend to be a little too drying under my eyes
what's more is you can even dab it
powder if it's looking a bit cakey throughout the day
this does not replace your eye cream, however.
i love how the iron feels cool when applying
if you are looking to only cover puffy eyes this product is for you
use it the way it's meant to be used or it can get clumpy
product will not work effectively if you hastily rub it in with your finger
take your time with the iron as it really helps.
i find the iron a little hard to work with
doesn't burn like a lot of other under eye products
i can't even count how many $ i've spent on eye creams
doesn't seem to work too well in ironing out puffiness
you only have to use a tiny bit to cover the area you want covered
you didn't get a lot of sleep or are hungover
its almost like i can feel my undereyes being de-puffed
it doesn't feel or leave my under eyes oily which is awesome
made them feel cool
it doesn't disturb it or wipe it off
who cannot wear a heavy moisturizer all the time yet need one every once in awhile
i didn't have to scrub hard or leave a moisturizer that bothered my skin on all day
didn't leave any residue
didn't make my face greasy like most masks have a tendency to do on combination skin
it amebas you can splash this on with out any messyit sucks right into your skin
use this to thin out my foundation or just under my foundation
doesn't leave my skin greasy or too shiny
doesn't get greasy by the end of the day
some of these moisturizers have products that cause everything to ball up when i put on foundation
i typically don't splurge that much on face wash
it doesn't clean nearly as well
i wasn't sure i would like this since when i was rinsing my face i noticed the squeaky clean feeling which isn't my favorite at all
by the way i don't have a brush
my skin didn't have that "tight" feeling one sometimes gets after washing
this + my clarisonic made my skin so clean
probably best for oily or normal skin
cause i could see this drying me out after repeated usages
it didn't feel drying either
good for all skin types even oily.
isn't too stripping on my dry patches either
you'll need to make sure to be properly matched to the right sonic brush though
i love the finish of this face wash it goes on mild
anything with any trace of fragrance will give me an allergic reaction all over my face
is more than enough because of the incredible amount of foaming this wash does
i imagine this would be even better with the fancy cleaning brush
when i used this wash instead of the foam my pimples were almost gone in two days
my face is squeaky clean but not dried out!!!
i can't wait to try it with my facial brush.
it's just a very solid face wash that doesn't have tons of fluffy ingredients that cause negative reactions
i noticed that when i used toner afterwards that there was very little makeup on the cotton pad
it does not strip my face of nature oils
this cleansure takes care of all of that without drying my face
so this tube lasts quite a while
didn't dry out my skin
i think for more oily skin
i love how it helps with the clarisonic glide over your face
a lot of other face soap leave the brush so soapy it takes forever to clean
this does not and makes it a breeze to clen.
i'll probably buy their regular face wash
this is the only oil that won't break my skin out
everything breaks my skin out
dry indoor heating mean my skin needs an extra bit of pampering
i even use it on dry
f i put make up on while it's not 100% dry
this stuff very well might be my holy grail when it comes to my skin care routine
nothing made my skin feel as good when i was using this cream
some how manages to not make my face never feel greasy
my t-zone was less oily
prone small breakouts if a product is too heavy or greasy
i've gotten plenty of compliments on my skin alone
i find it works best on clean skin.
can't really tell you if this makes my skin softer or reduces pore size or whatever
it's a multi tanker that will not leave you oily at all
most serums exacerbate my oil issue or break me out
the others i have tried are quite runny
that it dries pretty quick without making my face greasy or shiny
they heal super fast
it doesn't make my skin more oily or grease at all
i am normally a pretty dry
doesn't make it oily
definitely need the moisture
i am use to a more oily consistency with serums so with my first initial try i wasn't expecting much
this is a great all around serum even for people with sensitive skin like me :-
that my combination skin was showing more extremes in its dry/oily areas
this serum doesn't leave any residue or leave me shiny at all
which is actually too thick to be serum
it doesn't help with my oily problem
i feel like my pores are tighter which eventually should mean less oil production
doesn't leave my t-zone feeling oily
when first applying this product i found it soaked in really quickly
soft after i apply it
doesn't leave any weird residue
i find my skin needs a little more moisture now
i hate putting on a moisturizer after using this product because it lessens the effect
i don't need to apply powder over my tm to avoid a greasy look mid-day
i love that it doesn't make my make-up look greasy or shiny
i would use this with my skin needs a drink
use it when my skin needs a drink
this one is my favorite to apply because of the texture
or if it the other ingredients in this mask that give you the firmness
after washing off you do feel the skin tightening
the skin doesn't feel dry either.
after about 5 minutes the skin starts to feel warm which i really enjoy because you can feel it soaking into the pores
are filled with dirt that will not leave
they just make my skin tighter
absolutely love this mask- i have combination skin that occasionally gets hormonal break outs
oil out of my skin without being drying
i like this mud mask because it feels so luxurious on my face
i love that it is not drying
i do experience some tingling when i put it on
i like to think of it as it working to get all the dirt out of my pores
rinsing it off takes some time because it's pretty thick
i feel like it has cut down on how long acne stays on my face
it doesn't dry out my skin unless i leave it on for too long
i never leave on any longer than recommended or my face will start to feel sunburned while it is on
will keep this one in my skin care routine.
it doesn't dry as much as other masks i'm used to
really makes me skin feel less clogged
they were very drying
i suppose that can be due to the fact that all the impurities are brought up to the surface of my skin
washing off the mask can be a mess
it is not drying at all
it has a slight burning sensation when you put it on which i can tell is helping to remove dirt
sulfur in it which you would think would be great
i did not feel any burning or tingling with this because i read another reviewer said they avoided it by using a thin layer of the mask
this mask moisturizes without leaving you crazy even though i've used it 3 times on a problem area in 24 hours
it has not burned me it just feels like a little bit of yogurt smeared on your face or something like that
since it doesn't dry
the oil is still bad
can actually make it through work without having to use a oil blot sheet
i think the secret here is to use a thin layer to prevent the severe burning that other reviewers mentioned
i love that it doesn't dry like other face masks
only thing though is that it stained my h
it never got dry or super tight
love that i don't have to leave this on until it is dry like other masks
i love this mask because it's not drying.
you are suppose to take it off with a cloth
i just wash it off.
i also love how when you puff air onto it or air blows on the mask it kind or heats up
is also great for spot treating without drying out
i like to use it at night as part of my routine when i have breakouts or breakouts just ubder the surface that i feel
i never use mud masks because i have very dry skin
i will admit this product is hard to wash off
it does not dry out my skin
it is however extremely difficult to wash off.
it doesn't dry on your face like other masks do
since i have very dry skin most mud masks are too intense
this is where the moor mud mask is perfect because not only does it hydrate my skin
i could never seem to find a face mask that i could use that actually helped clear up blackheads
i don't want to harvest the oils in my skin
it also doesn't dry making your face feel tight like it's going to crack off
highly recommend especially if you don't like the feeling of typical mud masks
for me it doesn't burn or irritate my skin.
it didn't dry on me
this mask doesn't get super dry after leaving on my face for 15 mins
i can't use sulphur or charcoal masks because they dry me out
splashing it off won't do it.
you have to use a wet hot face towel
although the thick mud can be difficult to rinse off with just water
which can make your skin produce even more oil
it doesn't dry down all the way
i actually really like this mud mask.
the fact that it doesn't dry down
i feel like it really helps with controlling my oily t-zone as well
needless to say the weekend in dry dry heat
am able to get every bit of it off my skin without rubbing my skin
the entire time it's on your face it stays moist
this one remains relatively wet / sticky the whole time it's on
i could see so much stuff brought up to the surface
it's not too hard to get off if your towel is wet
it sort of stings when i apply it on my skin
it is a bit difficult to remove
just don't leave it on too long or your face will be lobster red
fast plus long term results make this guy my new favorite detox mask
don't mistake that with itching/burning
you need mix the powder with the solution before put on the face
i actually like this soap even more than the black one
i don't recommend using the black soap too often during winter
would be another story for oily skin type
the yellow soap is absolutely amazing during winter or any dry weather
or for dry skin
you could actually wash your face with it first
i will definitely get this product right away if you have acne prone or orily skin
i usually use miscelar water
my sink looks like it has mud all over it
it's like the deep cleaning allowed my other skin care products
this is some serious deep cleaning
i guess my skin couldn't cope with the pollution
dried my skin a little but thats usual for me.
which i normally apply after cleansing anyway
it's a pretty new texture to me cause i've been using oil balms for the longest time
i like that it foams up a lot
⭐️spend the 35$ on the black soap if you're wanting your skin to look smoother
when you apply it on your face it has a very creamy
it definitely is better for people with oily/combo skin
at first i just did quick washes
haven't had any clogging of pores or anything like that
because i have gentle skin it does dry it out a little in some places
don't dry out my skin
you may feel a little bit of dry once staring using it alone
i love this so much- especially in the dead of winter when my skin is so very dry
i generally layer it under bb cream- it feels like a good level of everyday glow for me
this doesn't leave my face any dryer
this cleansing bar doesn't dry it out too much at all
is not too shiny/oily looking
does not feel suffocating to my skin either.
i waited to buy this product because putting anything creamy or lotion-y on my skin makes me break out just imagining it
did not make me look like an oil slick
it's to remove all my make up when i'm too lazy to wipe it off
you'll still have some residue on your face
i already have dry skin
it doesn't dry my skin out
you really have to adjust your skin to this because it's so potent
if you feel any tightness or dryness then slow usage
it does dry his skin out a bit be a useful of the salicylic acid
it explains that it will dry your skin out
it can be drying
unless you have sensitive skin
i also use it as my body wash as well.
does not strip away too much moisture
i don't find it drying at all.
avoid dry areas as you may get "flaky".
night that does not make my dry skin tight right after washing
something not full of chemicals that it'll burn you or leave irritation
i also suggest that if you have dry skin like me
f you use it in the morning you may notice some peeling
it's never left my skin dry or oily.
doesn't dry out my skin
you really need to know what acids are in your products before use
it is the only thing that i cleanse my face with
i can't help but touch my skin after i clean it.
can only fall back on this facewash once a week now due to its drying effects
clear face wash gel- works well with a clairsonic- a little goes a long way
the bottle lasts awhile assuming you use only a dime size or so of product to wash your face
the one thing i have come to find out is that this cleanser is a very good cleanser especially if your using something such as the luna
especially gel face washes as they always dry out my skin
most face washes either dry out my skin or cause it to get oily
this stuff if magic in a bottle
is it is drying using it twice a day
products i have used in the past dried out my skin
drying like others i have used
i loved how clean my skin got without drying it out
this doesn't dry my face out
does not over dry skin
this can be slightly drying at times
this truly is the best face wash for my oily skin
it can be drying if used daily
i gave though ones that a normal exfoliation can't go deep down enough to clear completely
definitely can be a bit too drying for everyday use
not recommended for dry skin!
my face is not greasy now or too dry.
so yes sometimes it might feel a little dry after
it can be over drying if you use it more than once a day if you already have dry skin
doesn't dry my skin out
i really like this face wash
i don't even have any dry patches like i've had with some face washes
at first i didn't like how foamy it is when it lathers
i would tread carefully if you have combination skin
it did tend to over dry my combination skin
it will really just wipe that sharpie right off of your face
wanted a product that was going to wash my face without over drying it which would cause more production of oil
product does dry out my skin
i no longer get dry patches
this stuff works well beyond just cleaning your skin
my face was not that oily
i only need this kind of squeaky-clean feel in the summer to remove sunblock
use sparingly if you have dry skin
since i have sensitive skin i tend to use this only every other night followed by a good moisturizer
that seems to not over dry my skin
i didn't use to wash my face much before going to bed
they all either dry me out or don't clean my face
though it does not burn your skin
this stings little when you apply it
when i wear glasses i don't bother covering them at all since they have been minimized
it does tend to have a feeling like it dried out your under eye area
those that couldn't get rid of the beads used too much
only four stars because the beads don't break right away which can't be good for my skin
it has tiny beads in it that do not easily break down when you apply directly to the skin
both palms will be up when you do this.
the little beads did not all break when i applied the product
it did have a drying effect at first
it does sting a bit when you dab it on
the lack of sleep doesn't help
the downfall it is a little drying
for those of us who suffer from dark circles it's worth it since you don't really have to use as much concealer
there is no need to lather it on
drier skin types will probably need an additional moisturizing eye balm as it falls short in that area
because i have oily skin i've never had an issue with a dry eye area
i would suggests that someone with dry skin
it makes your skin baby soft super easy to use not time consuming i use it about every other day i'm in my early 20s
it would dry out my skin
i work it into a nice lather
it hasn't made my skin dry at all
doesn't feel dried out at all
(i tend to have normal to dry skin).
just like any other if used to often will dry out your face
i got hormonal break ours
did find this too drying for everyday use
it does go on mud-like
i don't have dry skin
it's actually more on the oily side
dried up while i rub it into my skin then i wet my h
yes i believe it is for oily skin
it doesn't dry me out a lot
sometimes u have to keep pumping
couldn't get it washed off
the instructions say 1-2 pumps on a dry face then to add water to your h
this not only gets your skin really clean
i feel dry if i use it too often
an added bonus- you don't need to wet your face before putting this on
doesn't dry it out or have any break outs
i just love how soft it makes my face feel during use
i do find it dries out my skin a little bit
i sometimes use this as a mask itself by putting it on right when i get in the shower
i will use this every day if my skin is dry
had to wash it off almost immediately because it burned my sensitive skin
it doesn't dry my face out
the when you apply the water it turns into the more traditional face cleaner
can easily get dry
i don't see any remnants of leftover make up
makes my face super soft without drying it out.
i typically use this in the shower
so my face is already slightly wet
if i use on a completely dry face
it does dry out the skin a little bit
normally i have to wash my face twice to remove every bit of make up
dry on your face before you wash with it
it also controls my very oily t-zone !
i am more on the dry side of skin type
the only ding in my rating is that the pump gets air in it fairly frequently
i will say it can dry your skin out a bit
i do need to use moisturizer afterwards though because my skin feels a bit dry
it gets all my dry patches and dead skin off!
it has started to dry out my skin a little
i don't usually get this dry
it isn't drying at all for me.
not as foamy as you would think
i leave it on like a mask till it dries then wash it off
does not give the burning sensation i get with the youthmud mask
if it didn't turn into that foamy consistency when wet
does leave my dry skin feeling a tiny bit more dry
it works really well to get my skin squeaky clean about twice a week
the scarring i have to go along with that is pretty bad
it can go on dry skin
my skin gets oily in the summertime
especially in the wintertime then dont use
it wasnt too drying like most reviews are saying
even with my oily t-zone
although my skin does feel nicer after using this
i still use it every day since my skin does feel pretty clean with it
this is perfect for people with normal or oily skin
because this cleanses so deep you won't be oily after a few days
especially since most washes i feel sometimes turn too quickly
i couldn't stop touching my skin.
love that this is not over drying
do not apply it to a dry face
wasn't sure about applying something with dry h
working in to a lather i felt the little beads doing their thing
it didn't leave it soft
you apply this product dry
it is very mud-like
does not sting if i don't use the blue hydrating mask
doesn't break my sensitive skin out
does dry it out a bit
doesn't pull them out like some stronger exfoliants do
can use it daily, feeling good on your skin.
youthcleanse can be a little messy to use
if you use it in the shower that problem is solved
i know if you have dry skin your probably have a slight fear of cleansers
between too oily it breaks you out or even worse dries you out
my face wasn't dry anymore
i definitely recommend this to all my combo/dry skinned girls out there
then you add water to make it foam
when you add water it goes into cleaning mode.
feels like you did a mask or overnight treatment as soon as u wash off
i suggest oily skin users use in the morning to prevent oil shine throughout the day
(mid 30's)i have super dry skin.
it has been super dry
however, i do recommend for dry skin.
also does not dry out my skin
it is definitely not drying at all
however i still follow with a laneige moisturizer afterwards to lock in the moisture
i get oily in the summer
dry in the winter
when my skin is dry i rely on this for my morning cleanse
which may be true for very dry skin
just need a bit more moisture in the drier months give this a try
it cleans my very oily skin without leaving it tight or dry
personally i have really dry skin
this definitely leaves me just as dry as i was after my first face wash
while i do love the deep cleanse it gives me i can't use it too often without it irritating
my t-zone is oily where as the rest of my face is normal/slightly dry
it's tough to find something that doesn't over dry my skin while still managing breakouts
even wearing certain types of makeup would make me look like i had something caked on my face because of those problem areas
burning which i felt was normal for switching my skin routine
i decided the next morning would show me if it solved my dryness problems
sure enough i checked my skin
perfect for aging or dry skin or just to use on your eye area
this cleanser is not what you'd expect from a cleanser: it doesn't foam up
are bad for your skin anyway
my breakouts are a result of not enough moisture
i only use one pump though it covers my whole face
honestly i could just deal with mud
you're supposed to wet your h
except for my excessively oily friends
it'll feel like you've just emerged your face in a bucket full of cool water
the only thing i would recommend though while using this is to wet your face a bit before applying product
i'd wake up with extremely oily
rub together whatever product is still on your fingers
then add a little more water to it to make it foamier
dry like it does after using other products
in the beginning i was a bit worried since it is a mud cleanser
its not drying at all
mix in a little water so you can really get the foam going because if you apply it directly to your face first
then add water it doesn't form as much foam
my skin is oily/combination and break out prone.
i do love it for days when my skin is starting to feel tight
doesn't dry out sensitive patches on my face
is a great face wash i apply it all over my face when it's dry then add water
s with a little water
never tight or dry
it didn't linger or bother my sensitive skin at all
while it does not dry my skin to the point of tightening it
everyone with dry skin issues
can dry out my checks
it may be too much moisture
my skin type is mainly dry not oily
this face wash is perfect for my dry skin.
even when i just use this wash
usually cleansers have this way of being great for the first week then eventually they make me break out due to over drying effects
i only have typically tried high end face washes when i get them in samples
my skin isssss slightly dry after i wash it
like i said i have dry skin
best face wash though and is very worth it.
it once you touch water to it
i follow up with my burts bees face wash to make sure i get everything off
decided to stick to just washing my face with water
when you add water
i love the process of washing my face with this
this doesn't make me any oilier
for my person super dry skin i find the best results are using daily when showering
t's not a daily moisturizer however once i find the happy medium i'm sure i'll love it
dry patches when i used it everyday
my skin is on the drier side now that i'm 32
dry skin so everything tends to irritate it
i guess because of "vigorosly" rubbing the product in like instructed will leave your skin red
the lather is way richer than the others
the lather itself is what i like most because the other two do not lather as much
it doesn't dry your skin out
i rarely have to use concealer now even on the days when i don't get enough sleep
doesn't make skin look oily.
the cream doesn't fix these
it will ball up if you rub it
this is so far the only eye creme that gives me adequate moisture
i feel like it's really feeding that super sensitive eye area with everything it needs
it seems to be just right for cold winter days in ontario
it doesn't burn like others
it's moist enough for use during summer
it does not sting or irritate my eyes even if it gets too close
another huge bonus was that it did not irritate or burn my eyes at all
i especially love the fact that it absorbs quickly
have really dry skin
i don't expect them to eradicate dark circles or make my fine lines completely disappear
it helps a lot with my dry/oily skin
the oil isn't needed everyday
it's great for your skin without all the added harsh chemicals
so coupled with how quickly it absorbs you have to do your face in sections
better moisture retention that doesn't leave me oily
which just sit on your face or are too heavy to use along with a moisturizer
you know it's going to provide some solid nourishment
it gets absorbed so fast i can put my day cream right after :
i do love how soft my face feels after smoothing this on at night
it's very hard to find effective skin treatment that doesn’t stick or feel heavy
i normally avoid serums because my face tends to be oily especially in the mornings
it can also leave it dry
my cheeks are so smooth i can never stop touching them
sometimes more on the dry side
since using this my oils don't break through my foundation as much
i like that my skins doesn't look oily afterwards
it does play quite nicely with foundations that otherwise may have been drying on skin
usually right after i cleanse i feel dry
doesn't make my combo skin oily or leave it dry
i tend to have dry skin
it goes away once it's on your skin
at the same time my skin is not greasy
i still do a weekly peel
i feel that all skin types could benefit from this product even if your oily
it is the best i have found for not only not drying out my skin
so residue is not a problem for me
it's so simple: rub it all over your face
been using this all winter for my dry
uncomfortable until i could get relief from my moisturizer
it does not get foamy
so you can get all the nourishing oils you can from it
in the summer i find that this alone gives me enough moisture to skip using a moisturizer
one pump of this oil into my dry h
i get oily skin in the summer
you get more in the bottle
especially when your feeling lazy to remove all your makeup
was hesitant about putting oil on my combination skin
you have to apply to dry skin then wet your h
gets it ready for your second cleanse
it doesn't leave your face dry.
i need to use another cleanser afterward to get the oily feeling off my face
its not perfumy, and doesn't leave any residue.
my face is so oily
i don't feel greasy or oily afterwards.
once i rinse it off there is still a light amount of the oil left on my skin
it is a good consistency - not too thick or thin.
when you add a bit of water
no matter how warm or thoroughly i rinse
there is a bit of residue
i never would have tried a cleansing oil otherwise
one pump is seriously all you need to wash your face
even longer if just used as a wash
what i do for an easier rinse-off: after applying the oil on dry face
i used a mkeup towelette afterwards to make sure i didnt miss anything
i didn't feel greasy after either.
you just have to get used to not having a lather.
not one bit of residue left on my skin
doesn't leave an oily film behind
even though my skin tends to be dry
i've always felt like i need some foaming action to truly get my skin clean
never felt like cleansing oils were doing anything for my skin
not at all like there is any oil or film or residue left behind
ered over to the skin care section to see what oil cleanser would get it all off
my face tend to be dry
it seems to have balanced my oily/dry problem out
made me feel like i needed to use a regular cleanser after to get rid of that greasy feel that remains with some oil products
if you are on the oily side
doesn't leave my face dry or with a residue.
i tend to use the oil cleanser in the winter when my face has to deal with winter
didn't strip or irritate my skin
you don't need very much product for it to easily melt away all your makeup
'll immediately wet my face
this product doesn't work so well if your face is wet
it has to be dry and i keep forgetting that.
face to really melt my eye make up
even when i do keep my eyes closed to rub off my mascara
does not feel greasy
this is not as thick
i don't have much to clean off my face
it never leaves me oily
it does not leave an oily residue or feeling on your skin
it does not irritate the eyes at all if it accidentally gets in the eyes
perfect for normal or dry skin.
actually more effective-- it didn't leave a trace of makeup on my skin afterward
how it makes my skin feel after i rinse it off
the feeling of the oil when you first put it on is so soft
once you add water
i don't have to reapply powder or blot anymore because oily skin isn't an issue anymore
i like to apply on a dry
face first just so that the oil can break away all of the impurities on my face
not greasy or tight
my face can be very dry at times
when i would use my make up removing wipes it left it even more dry
i know there was no residue because i used my miceller water with a cotton ball
i've even seen some additional residue come off when i use my toner after i wash
it is safe to say this is a staple in my skin routine now
it's worth a try if you have dry skin!
not greasy at all
get compliments on my skin all the time
not greasy or oily at all
doesn't leave a strange residue like other face oils that i've used
this oil is the best product i have ever used on my mature dry skin
it also does not leave my face disgustingly oily in the morning like the other serums i've tried
seaberry is a little too oily for me
this one is better on oily skin as it doesn't feel oily at all
it doesn't feel sticky or tight once dried
your skin's texture will transform just like mine did
this amazing liquids helps get rid of the crusty skin on top of them so that my makeup looks smooth
not greasy, mind you.
i won't be parting with this product in my skin routine
i end up using 3-4 cottons to get my whole face
my skin is not happy about being washed 2x a day.
the wrong face wash can cause a breakout
never skip cleansing your face
all i do is put this one a cotton pad
t doesn't make my sensitive skin break out at all
in the winter some parts of my t become extremely dry
dont waste the product on places that are already moisturized
when i used this cleanser the pad had lots of make up residue on it
it was like i hadn't cleaned my skin at all!
even after i have done my cleaning routine.
i went to look for something for my pores
not only does it not irritate my skin or eyes
this is the only toner/makeup remover out of the hundred that i've tried that hasn't given my skin some kind of horrible reaction
if you are one of those ppl who goes to sleep with out washing off your makeup or washing your face period
it is not drying
once in the morning let dry then the moisturizer worked great for me i can see the difference in my face
i don't even wash my face with "normal" cleanser anymore unless i'm in the shower
any zits that come up go away very quickly
most products that clear my complexion end up drying it with continued use
feels a little thick as if u need to wash it with water
my skin can now breathe again!
i love that you do not have to rinse it off at all
that you can actually see the grime that it pulls out of your skin
for starters i used my clarisonic to clean my face with some good face wash
it didn't dry out my skin
cleansing the skin at the same time that i don't even wash my face any more
because it doesn't interrupt the skin barrier like more heavy duty cleansing
not enough sun protection
still want to even out my skin tone
the only problem i have with the product is that it tends to turn my clear nail polish yellow
this cream has not caused me to be oily at all
this also doesn't sit heavily on the skin
for the winter i'll probably switch to the cream without the tint
since i just don't know if the tint would be a bit too orangey for my very fair skin in the winter
not heavy or greasy
now i use it whenever my skin is feeling dry.
at first i didn't like the texture because it's on the thicker side than what i am use to
the rest of face dry
for winter this is the best moisture that i've had
most others are too heavy or leave skin tacky.
this did not give me any dry patches
i don't feel like it made my skin more oily than usual
sometimes i'm told to moisturize that area more because that's why it's producing more oil
it didn't leave any sticky feel on my skin
my skin type is dry with some oily combo on small part of my face
no tacky finish or peeling off
one thing is to make certain to use sunscreen during the day because this can make your skin more prone to suns damaging rays
i stay out of the sun as much as i can
i wouldn't buy too many at a time though since the vitamin c will oxidize if it sits around too long
doesn't leave skin sticky or oily at all.
if your skin is still feeling tacky after applying
serums are concentrated you don't need much or your wasting it
i like that it is a bit watery so that i can smooth it everywhere i need to before it dries
one trick i have found is use it then wait 3-5 min before putting on your moisturizer
if you use it as your first layer it makes your skin so smooth
it does seem a little sticky
it doesn't burn at all when applied
i get so many compliments on my skin!!
i've always have those tiny bumps under my skin that you can't actually see
to note i also use a moisturizer over it as it does dry my skin out a little
i live in a very cold
put a bit of oil on after it sinks it as i don't find it terribly moisturizing
a combination of damp clothing left to sit for too long
i rarely stick to any skin care product
not greasy at all --
i tend to have oily skin
it might be too harsh or drying
it disappears quickly if you hate coconut
this is really good for dry skin like mine.
i wash my face with it as normal
dry me out or otherwise irritate my grumpy skin
which i find surprising considering my skin burns easily
i personally feel a warming sensation when i apply it to my face
when you squeeze it out of the tube there's no color change
when you rub it into the skin per the instructions it turns orange indicating that you have activated the mask
this product was used on me before i did my chemical peel
i put it on my dry skin
use a wet clarisonic to get it off
effective without drying out my skin at all
like it does not dry down or vanish.
usually breaking out my skin pretty badly
so might take more than just a splash of water to remove it
its really fun to hear it bubbling away on my face
after one application you'll notice that your skin looks
it does not dry out my skin.
i will say that i did feel a bit "tight" after removing the bubble mask
much more so than i feel with clay masks
like oxyclean for your face.
it doesn't feel as strong as a peel
doesn't cause my face to feel oily or sticky
if you already have a deep cyst it won't really help much
i will also wear under make up if my skin is flaring up
just use a dab or it can tend to ball up
if you don't overuse it under your makeup it's a wonderful way to keep acne at bay during the day as well
my normal combination dry skin does not know what to do with it self this summer
put it on when you feel acne starting to form beneath the skin
this does not dry out my skin
this is not drying
is colorless so you can wear it during the day
though it's drier than oily
this really does help the acne i get on my forehead from sweat build up
so you must put your finger into the jar which is not hygienic at all for an acne treatment production
nonetheless i would still recommend it to people with oily young skin
really helped repair my dry
i needed something to help with dry
forget about getting oily
gly gel which did very little for me
definitely recommend for someone with oily/problem skin :
i really like this gel for those times when my skin flares up for no reason
apply it directly on top of your makeup where you get oily
definitely try this out if you have oily skin!!
i love that it's worked to clear up any blemishes without over-drying my skin
or dry my skin at all
didn't make me look greasy like some beauty oils do
my face is dry
this must be aphrodite's sweat or something.
i really like this scrub.
so you have to be careful mixing in the palm of your h
this is my go-to mask for mornings when my skin is looking a little tired or dull
side note: this mask does not make my finicky skin turn red or irritated at all
however it's a bit annoying to have to add water to the powder-- can be a mess
you have to use a tiny amount of water though enough for it to still be "scrubby" for it to work best
didn't make my face feel too dry
the application was a little odd with dumping the powder into your h
the steam really helps it get into my skin
i feel like it is gentle enough to use it 1-2 extra times than an average exfoliator
also don't scrub your skin to hard with this product
i then wet it a little
while the powder adds just enough grit to make the cleansing power of the mix even better
or just water depending on my mood
i usually ad a little more water to loosen it up
due to having such sensitive skin its been impossible to find an exfoliater that doesn't irritate my face
heavy duty exfoliator that you use once or twice a week then this may not be for you
i would recommend this to anyone who has issues with flakey skin that gets irritated from most cleansers
you can use it on bare skin or to get make up removed
it doesn't dry out my skin either.
i'll need to try to use less powder
my skin doesn't look or feel irritated after using it
what really caught my attention was that it didn't contain harsh chemicals
you are either scrubbing too hard or you've used too much powder
this product has been great to get rid of some of the peeling
also you can choose to blend it with water which is great for those days you just want a mild exfoliation
it is just enough to get off any dead skin on my face
my skin can also be oily
still be flaking because for some reason my dead skin cells just don't want to come off
doesn't irritate my skin or dry it out
i would compare this to scrubbing your face with super soft s
i struggle with oily
doesn't dry out skin
i can't seem to get it out of the bottle without dumping some in the sink
don't over scrub if you're using it twice daily
i think though my face is kinda going through a little of a purging phase with this exfoliator too
i actually found it to betoo gentle when i add water
the good thing about it is that you can pretty much adjust the intensity by hoe much liquid you add
fine enough to not just scratch up your face
this stuff made me turn my back in a long time favorite exfoliator
put off using it because i was using other exfoliators
even when i mix with water i still find it leaves me skin baby soft
it will definitely last much longer than the liquid exfoliator i was using before
especially when in a humid shower
am totally geeked about how much lighter this product will be in my suitcase compared to the oil cleanser
it was much easier to use with a cleansing oil
i also realized i may have put too much into my palms to mix
always just mix it with water
give your skin a treat.
the only downside is you have to use a lot of the product to get a good scrub
some exfoliators are too much for me
i found it to be a little more abrasive when using with just water
didn't over-dry my skin at all
so supple when i get out of the shower
with water - just no.
what you add it to determines how harsh or gentle the exfoliation is
if my skin is extra dry i mix it with the oil
doesn't irritate my skin at all.
i take a bit of the powder
after using all these expensive treatments that dried out my skin
just a bit of water to make it smoother to apply
it doesn't dry my skin out
there's something in this that keeps me not so oily throughout the day
it is a little hard to get used to the powder form
you can feel your skin is so smooth after wash!
it makes a nice paste that doesn't burn skin or leave it feeling dry
as i like to clean my face first to take off as much as i can before exfoliating
i usually leave it on a couple of minutes to let the enzymes do their magic
it is gentle enough to use everyday.
it is a bit difficult to rinse off at the sink
smooth without breaking my face out or cause dryness
only downfall as other reviewer have mentioned is if you hold the bottle up to the light you'll notice the product is filled only 3/4 of the bottle
this does a good job of exfoliating my dry skin without drying it out too much
i find that a lot of exfoliating products are too gentle to really be effective at sloughing off dead skin
i really prefer exfoliants that have a fine grain so this feels really good to me
i like how it can be mixed with water or a cleansing oil
you can either use it with just water or with the cleansing oil
if you wash your face properly add this
dont need to go over the creases of my nose to get the junk out
it takes care of the dry patches i used to get on my cheeks
it did not irritate or cause my sensitive skin to break out
did not make my combo skin oily when used during the day
great for dry skin or just dry weather.
very rich without feeling heavy of the skin or leaving a gross oily residue
let it soak before i rub this in
scarring--i thought i would never go out without a blanket of makeup again
i can feel the added moisture
they are not left with a dry flake of skin when i was the mask off in the morning
it does not dry my face out with using it
it does not work nearly as well when using a thin layer
or doing a lot more for my skin than just wearing a mask
it doesn't get as stiff as many clay masks do
it doesn't make me feel like i would crack my skin if i were to move a facial muscle at all which is really nice
personally for me this doesn't cut it as i have an oily skin type
if i use this too often it dries me out.
i don't feel like i struggle with my skin anymore combining this with a good toner use
you don't have to spread it on that thick for it to work
i feel a serious need to buy extra jars
once you wash it off
although i have dry skin
i can't use anything too drying otherwise i get horrible dry spots
it does not dry out my skin
t did dry me out a little bit
did not dry out my skin
any texture you might have on your face
i've always wanted to do a clay mask
the drying affect my skin felt afterwards
not only has this not dried my skin
once i let this product come to a drying point
at 27 i just wanted a mud mask that didn't dry out my combination oily skin
at the same time your face doesn't feel dry at all after you remove the mask
it doesn't feel dry at all.
i always get compliments on my skin when using it
it did not sink in my skin
i tend to be very oily
doesn't irritate my skin at all
this is not sticky at all
it doesn't make my skin look greasy
it does feel slightly greasy for about 5 min if you touch your face after putting it on
it is a bit "sticky" at first
it doesn't leave any sticky residue like other c serums can
so u apply how many layer that ur under eye area can absorb
i do find i still need my eye cream for moisture.
not greasy or heavy
don't let the light weight texture fool you
definitely on the more of oily side
after applying it i thought it would be useless because my pores were still visible
i only applied this in my t-zone where my pores are more of a problem
nothing keeps my oil at bay as well as this primer
the tube lasts a long time too you only need a small dab in problem areas
my skin is a little less oily than it should be for this
tend to get a little oily by the afternoon
it can be a little drying
it you have oily skin
i don't have oily skin
it didn't break me out/wasn't drying
keep my very oily t-zone matte throughout the day
some people might find this primer a bit too thick or tacky for them
wont have a problem with blending
it does not break out my sensitive skin.
you only need a tiny amount of this product for a baby smooth
my skin has become drier the longer i live here
it works great if you have oily skin with some dry patches
i used the hope in a jar for dry skin for years.
it only burned because my skin was extremely dry from a weekend of camping in the elements
it doesn't have that annoying paper seal in the cap that soaked up your precious cream
dry skin problem like me
does the job, yet feels light on your skin.
seems my skin was just not used to a new cream at first
long story short: if you have really dry skin
i even use sometimes at night just because of the way it makes my skin look
not too heavy, just right.
i feel good knowing that my face is protected from the sun every day
i tend to have dry skin
cauz it may be too light for the dry winter.
not dry at all
especially for those with break-out prone skin
thinking that since i always forget to use sunscreen in the morning i'd just kill two birds with one stone
because obviously you don't put sunscreen on at night
it felt a little bit too much like sunscreen for me
it doesn't clogged my pores which i love because it means that my face has cleared out
it does burn slightly when applied
the texture of this product is interesting--you definitely need to use something other than your finger to dip into the jar
every other eye cream has burned my under eyes or just didn't moisturize it enough
when you put your finger in the pot the product is almost bouncy
it also has become a little oily.
can make you very dry
it is very moisturizing which is what i want since i have ecsema under my eyes
it is ultra hydrating-perfect for anyone who is normal to dry in the under eye area
that's because my undereye area was still sensitive from trying a different cream
it does state that it's an overnight balm
doesn't bother my skin in the least which is rare
that take forever to go away or irritate my skin
always check the ingredients to make sure your not allergic ❤️
it is creamy without being too much.
i do use this around my lips too.
not as puffy or dry as the used to
it is non-greasy and easy to apply.
you can actually feel the moisture in your skin
i don't usually like to use treatments on my eyes because they are all so greasy
this is a super thick cream that goes on easily
it is not greasy or heavy
you can still feel the moisture on the surface of your skin
my face is now never dry
just add a little more moisture
i can clean my face more because i was massaging it more
didn't leave any greasy or filmy feeling to my skin afterwards
if you rub it for only a minute or two you see your skin get brighter
somehow even with my dry skin my pores had became the size of kanye west's ego
i feel my skin gets used to them
normally oils seem to be just ok for my combination dry skin
i swear this stuff helped soothe the burn
i didn't have any peeling
my skin is dry in the winter
oily every other season
i don't have to worry about accidentally wiping away this expensive oil
can sometimes make your eyes burn
caution that it also may stain the pillows you sleep on
t made my skin more dry
i tend to be a little heavy h
i often just rinse my face with water in the morning without a full wash
this oil feels so luxurious going onto the skin.
for some reason if i use it every night it starts irritating my skin
works amazingly without that feeling of my skin being on fire
oily in others- now my skin seems to be pretty normal
i don't have much problem with it absorbing into my skin- i use 3-4 with an additional serum
my face is not as oily as it was before
i might look like a greased chicken going to sleep
what i like best about this oil is that it really evens my skins texture
this oil seems to keep blemishes at bay even with my oily skin
make sure to use spf though!
i still have very oily
not oily at all once it's on
your skin is left feeling like you've been at the spa
i do feel like my skin looks better overall in the mornings after applying it
the only con about this is that it does dry my skin out
for the first time in my life i'm able to wear a thin layer of foundation
so do not plaster it on
whenever my skin starts to look "blah" which is often because i have dry skin
i no longer have oily nor dry skin
this most likely will dry your skin out a bit
f you have extremely dry skin this isn't for you
i love this oil even at this price because i think it plumps
texture is going to take a bit longer
i once again feel confident just wearing sunscreen out of the house
it's the perfect amount of moisture on my face
the oil is not too heavy
otherwise it could dry out your skin
i tend to get very oily
not oily at all!
i'd say 4 maximum if you're very dry
a pretty noticeable floral scent which scared me because i thought it might break me out
i only tend to break out when i sleep with my makeup on
not as dull as before
i suppose because sap serum has a pretty sticky consistency
i can imagine it could be a put off or a cause of allergic reaction to a sensitive skin
with the cold weather we've been having its extremely dry
this one is a game changer for my parched winter skin
even thou it was formulated mainly for dry skin people i do love the after feeling
it's so strong that it could dry you out
this makes my face even dryer.
it doesn't burn or irritate my skin.
weather is so hard on your skin!
usually just winter/dry weather
have felt way more moisture
i tried everything under the sun to manage my breakouts
i hate using serums that leave a thick sticky film on my face
it sinks in so well and its not heavy.
i feel like using less i wouldn't always get an even mix of the little beads that contain the active ingredients
i would also like to encourage you to use the pure revival peel that helps to remove dead skin
my problem before was that my skin was oily
i don't get as oily that quickly either.
i wanted a little extra hydration in my flaky dry areas due to my combination skin
my skin felt oily when i used during the day + my normal makeup routine
my skin has gotten so oily in places
not oily, not dry, no issues.
not very sticky for a serum of this type
you can get another empty bottle to blend them together as well
or blend them together based on what's going on with your skin
even though it is an oil it absorbs directly into the skin without
at first it was kind of sticky
not oily like my usual 'morning skin'
sinks into my skin so easily, not oily at all.
it does dry out your skin a little
directions encourage every other day use if it dries out skin too much
i don't even flake from it.
doesn't leave me dry or irritated at all.
you can't have any waxing done while using this product
it can make you more apt to sunburn
my skin type is dry to combination in the t zone.
i feel i never see results or my pores get clogged
i find the oil-based consistency helps it to soak in quickly
it simply feels like a night time oil treatment.
it does not irritate or dry out my normal skin.
i've spent a lot of money over the last few years trying to buy "cheap" retinols l/chemical exfoliants instead of blowing money on something like this
i continue to get compliments on my skin.
i tend to be on the oily side
?i love that sometimes i can even use it in place of my moisturizer
if it's too drying
i find that in the morning when i apply my camu serum that it absorbs into my skin better
since the sun won't be as strong
how a clear gel would have sun protection in it
it does hold up the make up all day it does have sunscreen which is another plus
not the best of skin care
have a hard time finding something that is matte
doesn't leave any residue
my work environment is so dry
my skin is grease free by the end of my shift
who doesn't love the extra sun protection
doesn't leave me looking like a grease ball
which is super dry
sometimes the silicone ones are too thick for me
've had to use this either without a lotion beneath
this can be a bit of a problem if you're in a dry climate or have dry skin
if you rub it too much
it feels light rather than sticky or greasy
that it can pill if i rub rather than pat my makeup on over the top of it
it seems to help keep my oils at bay slightly
don´t like wear so many layers of products on your skin: with the murad invisiblur you have the primer
more as a filler for any lines on my forehead or a smoother anywhere else
the consistency will begin to dry out a bit as you get to the end of the bottle
i find my skin a bit less oily
the pump does not work on my bottle
don't rely on it for long periods of time outdoors or strong sun
it's been hard for me to find a good primer like this that can make my makeup outlast the texas heat
you just have to let the primer absorb into your skin as with any primer
so you can swipe it on gently like you would sunscreen
if you try to rub or swipe your foundation across your face
not only does it help with my greasy face its an spf
my face isn't oily at the end of the day
i don't look greasy while getting some spf protection
i've never had issues with the product flaking or rolling into little balls how some have said
any other primer or product with spf under my foundation usually makes me oilier
i noticed if i use too much it pills a bit
never had any trouble with pilling or peeling.
no burning or sun damage in the 110 degree desert weather
is that one needs to be very careful to dab or smooth on quickly
it will dry very fast which does produce little lumps of dried up product on the skin
probably better for dry skin than for oily skin.
i will say that upon applying it there is this odd "chemical" smell that takes a few minutes to go away
doesn't make my face so greasy
still need to use a primer to help cut greasy face look
it has kept my skin not oily for over night
it is not mattifying though
your skin might need time to heal
not moisturize too much to bea greasy mess
found that it dried out my skin in certain places
sometimes i have even forgot to use a setting spray afterwards
i do think it does a decent job of keeping my oily skin at bay
i don't find myself getting shiny throughout the day
i give it a 4 because i don't think it will combat extremely oily skin
you still have to use it in moderate amounts or it can get cakey
this is perfect if you are in the oily skin boat!
primers make me break out really bad
i barely get oily throughout the day.
dry in the winter
i don't think it does much to reduce the size of pores or control oil
make up will literally melt off your face.
can get quite oily in summer
because twice daily use make my skin crazy oily
the humidity always makes my face turn into a greaseball
when there is little to no humidity or i'm traveling to places with drier climates then i definitely won't reach for this because it can really dry out certain areas of my face
my skin type is more combination normal/oily with dry patches every once in a while
even though my nose is always oily
it is not worth it for me to use this because some areas of my skin will dry out
this tends to dry out my face
i now longer worry about finishing powder because my face produces so much less oil
it still helped control my oil despite the humidity
once it dries to a soft matte finish you cannot even feel that it is there
though my normal/combo skin doesn't typically get oily
kind of pat it around then rub it in
my normally very oily skin has definitely stopped producing so much oil
so far it's the only day time moisturizer that doesn't leave me oily again within a few hours
it doesn't irritate my skin at all
definitely worth a try if you have similar oily/combo skin
my t zone is considerably less oily
i actually end up having a "glow" to my skin
i didn't notice this helping to subside my oils
no drying nor excessive oil
love the way the gel feels when you first put it on your skin
doesn't leave me oily/cause breakouts
after washing my face it is dry
've yet to find a cream that hits all the sweet spots in that it keeps me hydrated without giving too much shine
am prone to breaking out if i'm not careful
my skin feels way less oily throughout the day
my face is like an oil slick
since using this with the red clay cleanser my oil has been so much better as well as the size of my pores
unless you're going from an oily moisturized as comparison?
or your skin is irritated enough to produce more oil?
if you need to mattify i suggest a powder
doesn't make me break out or more oily
my skin get's really dry in the winter
my skin also gets less oily through the day.
some much needed mattifying
it's not drying at all.
i didn't find it "mattifying," though.
i think this would be great for oilier skins
it did a good job at keeping my oils to a minimum
it made my face an oily mess
would recommend it to anyone with combo/oily skin
it didn't keep me completely matte
as someone with oily skin that gets worse in the winter
it doesn't keep me matte all day
i would still recommend you use a good powder over if you're especially oily
make sure not to use too much or it will make your skin feel oily
a lot of reviews talk about making it give oily skin-
you only need a very small amount in dry areas.
i still like i have to put another moisturizer on my t-zone
that gets oily easily with anything that is put on it
doesn't "weigh" my skin down or irritate it.
t's almost too mattifying for me
which i never thought would be possible with my oily/combo skin
itchy while the rest of my face tends to be a bit oily
my face is not dry
it tends to dry me out in the winter months though
thats how good it is at controlling oil since im usually oily even in winter
my skin always gets oily at this time of year.
my face is no longer greasy
it can feel a bit drying
not sure about the mattifying part
sensitive skin that tends to break out from many products
mattifies my oily areas while still providing moisture to the rest of my normal/ occasionally dry face
this product has not made me oily at all!
does not dry or break my skin out
i 100% recommend for anyone with oilier skin in the summer
this doesn't keep me matte all day
if you're not as oily as me
you're probably not because i'm a grease ball
it can be drying if you use nothing with it
i prevent that by putting just a tiny amount of moisturizer in with it
make sure you mysterious any dry areas before doing this though
let this dry before applying any primer or makeup because it will ball up if you put too much on the skin layer over layer
i needed something thin enough to use in the mornings under my makeup
didn't make my super sensitive skin break out.
my t-zone is the area that gets the most oily
i still get a bit oily throughout the day because of the heating at my place
my skin doesn't break out as much
my skin gets oily as the day goes on
i like this because its not tinted
make sure you do a good job washing it off at days end though
although i have normal/dry skin
i lightly pat on a small amount over the areas that bother me
it's too drying to be used all over my face
if you're on the drier side
it does leave my tzone matte throughout the day
it goes on a little greasy
if you let it set for a few minutes the grease disappears
her nose does not get greasy during the day
my bags under my eyes can get so bad
as demo'd it is supposed to feel wet
you let sit/soak in for a few minutes while you brush your teeth or do done other part of your routine
i just leave it on until it semi-dries then put an eye cream on top
the best part is the ball is freezing cold!
have had the hardest time finding a moisturizer that doesn't hurt my skin
it gives my skin the perfect amount of moisture without feeling oily at all
i did not have any irritation nor did it clog my pores
i've forgotten how my skin would feel tight due to a lack of hydration
i just recently found this particular moisturizer after finding out that i had extremely dry skin
i really enjoy the bouncy gel-cream consistency which is enough to totally quench my dry skin
oily areas really well
this is great as long as you do not have super dry skin
it doesn't make my pores suffer either!
it doesn't dry out my skin
it only took one application for me not to have dry patches over my makeup
as a woman with dry skin i can finally wear matte finish with no patches
especially if you slather it on or in hot summer temps
added needed hydration without making my skin feel greasy or heavy at all
it doesn't sting or turn my face red like a lot of other moisturizers do
not greasy at all
opt for a lighter moisturizer in the morning as florida heat will melt anything off my face
its like your skin is drinking this up!!
who tend to be dry
even though i have dry skin
just to be clear not all alcohols are bad for your skin
which is super important to me as i often cut my moisturizers with different treatment oils that will sometimes be a little intense on their own
doesn't leave my skin oily and lasts all day
so many cream don't work or dry it out even more
love that the cream is thick yet when i put it on
i could feel it sink into my skin
my face was so dry
definitely more of a once in awhile cream or for the colder months
i wouldn't use it for dry or oily
get this if you have dry skin!
this is intended for very dry skin like mine.
i apply only what is left on my oiliest area
especially if you have dry skin.
have struggled with finding a moisturizer that is heavy enough
used it one night when my skin felt dry
this was a lifesaver during the dry winter when my skin is prone to flaking
doesn't sit well on my oily t-zone
doesn't leave my skin oily
with this cream on top my flakiness from the medicine is gone as well
amazing if you have dry skin.
all the while knowing it was not enough moisture
this stuff is straight up the best moisturizer-doesnt claim to be any else
this jar was a godsend for my dry skin!
gets really dry during the winter
i personally only use at night because i have oily skin
however, the moisture is definite and it lasts.
i am no longer peeling.
i typically never use face cream
my skin is so dry that if i laugh or smile
that is what the origins drink up overnight mask does to my skin
this is seriously a miracle product beause it turned my painfully dry skin into normal skin within a few weeks
my dry areas are super dry
this one was my favorite because it was thicker which is good for winter
when i would get a cold
this product really is a moisture bomb on your face :
it doesn't leave a tacky greasy feeling like so many other moisturizers yet it does the job
i instantly fell in love with this because it hydrates my skin without making it feel greasy or to heavy
i find it needs a little longer to sink into my skin
my skin gets super dry during the winter
it didn't hold the moist for very long
this did not affect my skin other than giving it a plump soft look
it definitely doesn't feel heavy or greasy
i'd imagine this is better for dryer climates though
some creams are heavy or greasy, not this one.
i get really dry on my cheeks
during the winter i always get dry flaky skin
not greasy or heavy.
i like to put on a heavier moisturizer at night so my skin has the time to soak it up
yet somehow i still get dry skin on my face
why people don't patch test
i get dry patches on my face
i would wake up with dry skin
would get flaky throughout the day
i would not recommend this product for oily or normal skin
it feels like you just put a heavy cream on your face
it made my face really oily.
no residue, nothing but clean!
i love how foamy it is because it makes me feel super clean without drying my skin
i agree with a lot of the other reviewers that this is a pretty drying wash if you already have dry skin
nothing the rest of my skincare routine can't get back under control
as someone with drier skin it is very hard for me to find a cleanser that gets my skin "clean" without completely stripping all moisture
the vast majority of cleansers i have tried either make my skin so dry
this face wash does not irritate it at all
need a clenser that is gentle enough to not dry out or irritate my skin
i suppose that could be uncomfortable with dry skin
it's never felt at all drying
as long as you're applying it to a wet face
you really only need a pea-sized amount to get a good lather
they either were so gentle that they did nothing to remove dirt
oil or were too harsh
doesn't dry my skin out or feel tight
be careful around your eyes it burns like crazy!
it cleanse very well and doesn't dry out my skin.
people who are saying that this leaves their skin dry probably aren't using the moisturizer
the only problem is that my skin gets tight after using it
i really like this face wash.
a dime size portion can really work up a lot of lather
it doesn't dry my skin out
i love this product, my face is dry and oily.
people keep saying it dries out their skin
maybe it is actually designed for oily skin
don't like the drying factor
isn't at all drying
doesn't dry my skin out
this made me think it'd be drying
it doesn't because there is still makeup on the cotton pad when i follow with toner
you need just a little bit to wash face
once you apply water
i've always had that problem after washing my face as my skin is dry already
this face wash leaves it less dry than others i have tried in the past
it really helps to lather up the product even though i can get a nice foamy lather with just my h
when my t-zone will be more oily
i still get flaky sometimes
dry in the winter
all it did was dry out my skin
it used to be really dry
now i can tell that it has become way more moisturized
however, it burns if it gets in my eyes.
i got the travel size of this in the winter moisture l
it does not dry your skin out
i didn't have to use a lot of product for it to lather
it doesn't leave my skin dry
fresh without the residual junk i feel like is left on my skin with other cleansing waters
i am into micellar waters because they are better for your skin
don't want any sticky residue on your skin after application
as great as it is i will be changing it to a heavier product as winter approaches as i am not sure it will be hydrating enough for dry skin
anyone who may have dry skin
the rest of my face gets dry really easily in the winter
is just moisturizing enough so my face doesn't feel dry or right
my t-zone doesn't get out-of-control-oily
i also find that it helps control oil without drying my skin out
doesn't break me out or irritate my skin.
doesn't leave me greasy
way too many are thick or leave my skin feeling blah
normally when the weather starts getting colder
it does not feel greasy at all.
i am most likely to buy it again during colder seasons to see how much it actually works with severe dry skin
our winters are dry
my skin gets very dry in the winter months
my skin is combination, and i get dry patches.
the skin sucks up the moisturizer so there aren't greasy feeling after few minutes
i tend to get dry around the mouth
it was not enough moisture
may be better for oily skin.
it's like puting water on your face
so we decided to try a formula for dry skin.
they're not so thick that they make me look like a grease ball
i wouldn't recommend this for someone with oily skin
it will make them too greasy.
provides enough hydration for my skin to not flake or look dull
didn't leave my skin oily at all
or they make my skin feel greasy
my face doesn't look of feel like a grease mess or move around under my makeup if i happen to put any on that day
i can feel the residual on my face
i would also like to mention that i used to have oily skin
t doesn't get sticky like other products
so after discovering i have a normal/dry skin type
not greasy at all
doesn't leave an oily film on my skin
make-up without having a greasy mess on my face
maybe it's too lightweight for dry skin or cold weather
is a wonderful moisturizer for the warmer months as its not greasy or oily or heavy at all
i love how fast it sinks into my skin
light weight/ not greasy/hydrates as well as it says it does- a little goes a long way
my entire life i have struggled with oily skin.
once i learned that when you have oily skin your face is compensating for a lack of moisture i started to investigate
gives me the perfect amount of moisture without being oily
not enough for my normal borderline oily skin in winter
is not greasy at all
though i did go through a few very dry/flaky skin days when switching over
i love that it does not cause me to wake up with my skin oily af in the morning
so overall great item for oily skin
i love using it over any face oils i use at night
the other version of this is just too heavy for my skin
does not feel thick/sticky on my face afterwards
i sure don't feel dry through out the day
much better at sinking into your skin
oily t zone, drier in other areas.
rains we get most of the winter
it is however healing to wear overnight to instantly restore moisture back into your skin so that you can wear a good application of makeup under it
not just the face for an added moisture
i can't recommend this enough if you live in a humid climate
just crave a little moisture locked in
doesn't sit on the surface of my skin
it's the perfect amount of moisture for me
not greasy or irritating
usually if the product doesn't have a gel base it makes me break out
if i could bathe in this i would!
especially if you have oily skin
is also easy to layer on days where you need a bit more moisture
it doesn't make me break out at all while actually giving me moisture
this is a great product for anyone with dry skin!
does not leave a residue either.
usually i don't stray from my facecare routine because i have sensitive skin
especially if it gets too dry
especially thick or oily ones
i usually never even finish off products
found it left me feeling slick because it didn't absorb well enough
don't dry your skin out
this stuff is way less like water
so this stuff doesn't quite do the job in the middle of winter– i usually add another moisturizer to my routine
not super oily throughout the day
it did not irritate my skin at all
i don't feel like i have a thick film over my face
doesn't leave my skin super thick or oily
as soon as you put it on it really is an intense hydration
definetly recommend if you normally get dry skin at night
wish it was more cream based as it seems it evaporates during the night
throughout the day my skin doesn't get oilier
occasionally gets dry in areas
most of the time when i buy a moisturizer i get nervous because most br
this does help with my dry skin
so lightweight while also being hydrating which is exactly what us oily girls need
the only thing i want to point out about this product is that it is so hydrating that my skin stays a little shiny
wish it had a pump so all the bacteria wouldn't get in there
whenever i applied a moisturizer to my face i just looked like a ball of grease
this is so bomb especially if u have dry skin
in the winter i turn into an actual raisin
it doesn't make me oily at all
not greasy till about 4 if i applied it around 8
my only gripe would be it takes quite a while for the product to soak in
not dry out my skin cause it is not that oily
hated it left my skin way too dry
it doesn't feel heavy or make you more oily
was able to wash it off with just pure warm water
aqua bomb is one of the very few products that actually gets rid of my dry patches without adding to my breakouts
it does feel a bit sticky for awhile after application
without that wet greasy feel
it doesn't leave my skin greasy or sticky.
not at all greasy
i don't like having to use a spatula to get the product out
my under eye area becomes very dry because of the cold weather
age:31my eyes/lids had become dry as the dessert due to a product i had used
it doesn't burn or sting.
so many eye creams sting/burn if you apply them to your lids
it does not feel tight or dry or itchy
i've finally found one that doesn't burn
i don't feel like my wrinkles are getting any smaller
gross because the skin underneath was so dry
if you suffer from dry skin
extremely dry under eyes this is a must
claiming this cream was so rich it left some with milia
i remembered being told that eyecreams can sometimes used as a neck cream too
forget to apply it to my neck
i don't even have to use that much of it to get adequate hydration
it has really helped to retain moisture in my eye area
it sinks into skin almost immediately so you don't have to worry about your hair sticking to it or if feels weird on your skin
doesn't make my face feel gloppy
thick to make my skin break out
as someone with oily skin
you only need a tiny bit of product
while i generally have dry skin
my complexion is not 100% even because i only use this mask twice a week
they all either dried my face out too much or actually caused a breakout
literally my skin was so dry.
i do love how quickly it sinks into my skin
a lot of overnight masks feel like they just sit on my skin
i never really tried a peel off mask
it immediately says that you wait for the mask to dry
it doesn't really "peel-off
you can just rub your face
i think we all loved those plastic-y peel-off masks from long ago
little bits do get stuck in your hairline if you're not careful
once it is completely dry
i love peeling the mask off although it doesn't really show
it's true that it will get stuck in your hair if you get too close during application
easily comes off with wishing face with water
takes a bit to get it all of by peeling
i ended up washing the residual product off with a washcloth as there were bits here
be careful not to get any in your hair as it is a bear to get it off
it did dry my skin a little
now i only do the mask before i shower
i find that it is slightly tacky to the touch after it dries onto the skin
let it soak in
it says you can use it as like a spot treatment or a mask
you only need 1 pump to cover your whole face.
the moisture bomb has a bit of a waxy-ness to it that i don't like because it sits on top of my skin where the other two absorb completely
you don't feel greasy afterwards because it absorbs so fast
this will continue to be a 'must have' for my dry skin
my face wash that i have been currently using is a little more drying
it get bit drier on winter
my skin gets so oily throughout the day
then i use this product to keep my face moist
you only need half the amount to clean your face
the oil is much lighter in consistency than the other cleansing oil i've tried which makes it easier to spread
means i use less of it to clean my face
doesn't do so much in the lightening which i don't mind because it plumps your skins so well
i absolutely love that i don't have to stick my fingers into a pot
i even struggle with dry skin.
not greasy i use this instead of the serumexcellent results
does not irritate or cause burning to my eyes
then the sun doesn't help
with this cream i really like how my undereye area is looking
i love the new power eye cream as i have very dry
i don't think it would be super great for anyone with oily skin or really dry skin
so i wouldn't worry about the tint.
when no spf needed
not noticeable unless you are looking at your skin up close
there is a pink or gold color you can choose from
does not leave my face oily
even in the humid environment outside
i dont think it has enough moisture in it for the winter
i mix it with my bb for a little extra moisture.
t was great in the summer when i didn't need to moisturize as much
now that it's winter i am having to either apply it twice or use an alternative moisturize
my skin doesn't feel tacky or greasy at all after applying this
very dry in others
one day my entire face is an oil slick
most importantly it doesn't irritate or break out my sensitive skin
tend to stay away from anything labeled "all skin types"
you can feel the moisture work easily into your skin
i like this a lot for when i just want to add a little bit of extra moisture to my skin care routine
so on days when my skin is a bit drier i will go for a heavier oil
its great under a moisterizer for dry winter face
the skin was so dry that my regular acne go-tos weren't helping
it moisturized my weird dry-acne spots without making me break out further
now i use it whenever things get dry right before i put my regular moisturizer on
have that dry skin feeling through out the day
it drinks it right up there is no oily residue.
keep skin blemish free i would try this one
this is literally food for your skin.
i will say that this is oily
gentle enough to use everyday
i chose this as a sample thinking this was the teaberry moisturizing face oil because i wanted to replace my previous morning face oil
unless i'm not putting enough on my fingers
now if i feel that skin start to itch
haven't even tried it on my face, too precious.
it did not hurt my sunburn and i did not peel.
with or without peeling i was happy to be able to put it on my burnt skin without any pain as sometimes oils can worsen the burn
my skin has been more on the dry side because of winter of course
so so drying even in the summer
it just seems to be another facial oil though
my skin has a tendency to get dry in that area
which didn't give me enough moisture
i'll have to keep using it to see if it completely clears up my dry feet
it doesnt make it more oily
can tend to get crepey looking in areas
because of the oil it doesn't dry out my skin at all
can be a little drying so make sure to use moisturizer right after
this doesn't dry me out or make me too oily
i absolutely love the combination of oil and mud.
i dont get as many pimples as i used to before my period
they seemed to be making my face even oilier
oily t zone and dry everywhere else.
it doesn't do enough to fully clean my pores
it does not dry out my skin
you are in control of how much mud
apply to my dry face
then i get my fingers wet
it's gotten better results than any topical washes
use the mud for spot treatment on your face
it dried out my skin too much
i needed a face wash fast because i had been living off of using body wash for my face
was too drying for the rest of my face
i love how you can customer your cleanser/mask to suit your skin's needs at various times
it does not strip my dry areas of moisture
i even wear less make up
so everyday i would try to mask my blemishes in make up because no face wash could control my skin's rebellious tendencies to flare up at the worst times possible
$39 is a bit pricey for a face wash
the pumps let out very little product
it's not over drying
at first i was a little iffy on the use of an oil in my oily areas
i've noticed that my combo skin has started to even out where my oily areas are less so
my dry patches are nice
oil put it on my dry face
thats because its bringing everything out to the surface of the skin
dry nor covered in a balmy film
i love the oil | mud combo which you can adjust to your liking by adding more or less pumps of each
love that you can adjust the oil to mud ratio to add more of one or the other as you wash
it cleans way better when you apply it to a dry face
one for the oil so you can add more of the oil if it's too drying
if your complexion craves replenishment the oil phase will take you there
it is the first facial oil i have ever purchased because i was always afraid that oils would make my skin "extra oily" since i'm already on the oily side
when you put the oil on your skin
even though i have combo skin
i feel like i'm less oily now.
i am normally oily
just mix it with your fingers
a bit greasy but its an oil!
in the morning i might add a couple of drops to my hair to make it more manageable on the days i don't wash it
thankfully it doesn't linger after application
it also sinks into my oily/combo skin without breaking me out
none of them sink into my skin
they just float up there making my face greasy
this was the only thing that stopped it from flaking this winter
a must have for those with dry skin
it is not greasy in the least if you use it sparingly
it feels less like a oil.
does dissipate a bit so as not to be a problem for sensitive skin
it is not a greasy product
it's great for my oily skin in northeast winters
not too drying or oily
even though i am in my 50's my skin is still pretty oily in the summer
i don't need much moisture
this is the perfect amount-- great for oil-prone skin
seems to control oil because my face is not as shiny as usal
it's a little bit hard to melt into the skin especially when ur skin is dry
it did take a week or so for my skin to adjust because it is slightly drying
i supplement with a touch of cetaphil when dry weather hits
the spf is high so keeps me from burning all day
although i always apply with clean freshly washed h
i wouldn't recommend it for someone with dry skin cus it doesn't offer too much moisture
skin is not oily even after this large amount of time
makes the oil slick situation worse
i don't have oily skin
i think it would be good for oily or combination skin
is only so-so for my dry skin
it's close to impossible to find a daily face cream that has a good spf
i get oily pretty easy through out the day
sometimes get dry patches here
it help with my dry patches
this cream does such a great job blurring imperfections that people think i've used a filter even when i post an unfiltered picture
this stuff gives you the perfectly primed face texture you need to put the rest of your make up on
it doesn't feel oily
still have oily skin this stuff keep me oil free all day long
i recommend trying this out if you have combination or oily skin
with oily skin i love that it doesn't leave me too shiny
it really looks good on your skin by itself or under foundation/bb cream
there hasn't been a primer thus far to keep my skin mate or control my oil
i apply a little more in super oily areas n really helps
it doesn't feel like i'm wearing a cream to the touch
for being very dry
not one bit heavy or greasy
it does not make her skin oily at the end of the day
what i like about it: no burning or tingling on application
it doesn't cause any allergic reactions nor makes my skin break out in specific areas
if you just apply this straight to your face you will have a white layer
if you apply it to your fingers
goes on smooth stays on haven't burned yet i love this sunscreen
sometimes i have to reapply when my skin is particularly dry
humid it's one less thing on my face that might slide off
this is a little bit dry out of the tube
this lotion took me a few tries before figuring out how to make it work for me as far as minimizing the minor white cast it tends to leave underneath my foundation
t does leave a little white sheen on my skin
i didn't get sunburned on my face once.
which the 5 in 1 face cream doesn't have
then i read the review the said you need to warm it up by rubbing it in your h
if i let it soak in for about 3 minutes or so
the other reviewers are correct in that if you warm it first there is no white hue
if you're using it alone it does give your skin a white-ish tint
it does not leave your skin with an oily finish
it's definitely better than the josie maran sunscreen this one is not as sticky
it can leave a white tint if you don't rub it in completely
that's the key - rub it in completely.
if you warm it up
you'll probably end up using too much or leave white streaks
you must warm it in your h
rubbing will only make it feel tacky.
t hard to spread on the skin
if you keep massaging it in
i don't get greasy by the end of the day
my skin looks as if its under a blacklight for about thirty minutes until the products fully dries
once it's rubbed in you are good to go
not dry or greasy
doesn't feel thick at all
usually the higher spf means a very thick
your skin doesn't look shinny right after application
there's no pilling if you over-apply
it does not make my skin oily/greasy
it's not sticky or greasy or heavy at all
so satisfying to the mask dry so quick
because i actually have always had nice clean normal skin
it will tighten dryer areas so use wisely depending on your own skin needs
so many masks that i try make my skin raw
i love that it doesn't irritate my skin
especially as someone with dry skin
i find it hard to find a mask that has a mattifying effect
doesn't dry out my skin
i love that you can see all your pores when it's drying on your face
plus you don't have to leave it on your face for very long since it dries so quickly
i can't say if it's from the mask itself or from using a wet washcloth to remove it
what is up with the little pieces that don't rub in?
easy to get your whole face covered quickly
i could see exactly where it was sucking the oil out of my pores
my skin is so clean and not oily!
i applied this to my face until dry
follow up with a good moisturizer because this will absorb excess oil
if your face is a nasty grease pit like mine
i can go outside without the sun reflecting off my greasy face
i look for anything that can shrink or clean out my pores
this is quite literally the best mud mask i've ever tired
my skin is starting to get a little dry again
normal to dry everywhere else
didn't dry it out at all
it still felt less oily which i appreciate
put it on my dry skin
it was really drying
felt a bit drying at beginning
although it burns sensitive skin for the first few minutes it legitimately gets rid of almost all of your blackheads
although i would not recommend for sensitive skin as it is drying
even though i have dry skin it was a tiiiny bit drying
literally a small touch takes out all the oil in you nose
my face is less oily after using this
it doesn't sting or burn
i wouldn't recommend this for someone with dry skin
because i feel like it would dry out your skin more
if you a combination of oily
dry or just oily
the only thing that aggravates me is the little lumps really thought it was going to be more creamy
it isn't messy or drying.
i do find my face a little more matte
there is a texture in the mask which i kind of enjoy
it really does feel like it gets rid of the gunk in my face
this mask is the only alternative i've found to glamglow's supermud that actually gets everything out of my pores
this product dries my skin out too much
this keeps all my skin problems at bay when i use it regularly
it seems to dry it out a little
this really does clear up my skin overnight.
of course if you have more cystic acne like me it will take a little bit longer
when you apply it you can see the mask cling to all the imperfections on your face
after washing it off you instantly see a brighter face
super clean whenever i use this
just prepare to deep moisturize if you have dry skin like myself
make sure you exfoliate really well before you use this mask or it won't be able to properly pull all of your gunk to the surface
i knew i would not go back to my glam glow mud masks
he is not a face cream/mask guy
don't dissolve so they're just sitting on your face
does tingle when you apply it
still put it in my oily places
for my dry spots, it worked so well!
it does tingle on my skin for about 30 seconds after applying
i apply it all over my face because i'm extremely oily
not only does it suck out all the extra oil from my pores
my pores do feel better after using it
this mask will shrink it right up out of your life
you can see the mask working as it dries
desperate for something that will help clear your pores
because it is for all skin types while typical mud can dry you out
as someone with dry skin
i wish it was slightly better are purifying the pores or build up
t oxygen facial you will love this one even more because it's 1/3 of the price with very similar results
you can really feel the product bubble up on your skin
it washed off no oeiblem too.
spread it around my face the product is suppose to sit for no more than 3 minutes or else your skin starts drinking it up
then you wash it off and off you go!
it does not leave your skin tight.
must safe in dry
i like how thick it becomes as it foams so you can massage your face
it's just as good at the others that claim to "infuse your skin with oxygen" or what have you
doesn't strip your skin or leave it begging for moisture
did not burn or tingle, as i have sensitive skin.
the bubbling of the gel once it is exposed to oxygen does not bother me because i am very happy with the results
i really really don't care for the tight feeling of strong mud drying type masks
i know the instructions call for a damp face for application
try not to walk around too much when it's bubbling up
i really felt that it got out the bug spray
that stuff is oily
get in the shower wash my face
then rinse it off it literally takes me no extra time to use this product
most facemask if i put them on a need to have a clean face so usually do after the shower not going to go to the sink
always end up getting water with the mask residue all over
i assume that means slightly damp skin
i simply use warm water
i used 2 pumps and it seemed like too much.
a pump bottle or tube would be so much better.
i don't wash it off.
i just let it soak in
put these in your refrigerator
then applied this with a little water
i guess because i washed my face so thoroughly it burnt
so make sure you save it in a ziploc bag
it does get warm!
i love that i can put it on my dry face
it really does warm up
i love the way it warms my skin when i'm running it in
while it doesn't necessarily have the foamy leathery suds you may be used to
the only down side i think is that it doesn't lather up very much
it doesn't get as warm as i expected
this does not make your face oily.
good for using it in the dry winter.
i find it's warmer the dirtier my skin is
i apply it dry
the instructions say to use it on a dry face to start the "warming" of the product
this really dried out my skin
there's no need for a double-cleanse
the only thing you should know about this cleanser is that is does not foam very well if you use it with a sonic cleansing system like a clairsonic
it's heavy duty make up you might have to wash your face twice to make sure everything is off thoroughly
at first it did make my skin a bit dry
it does not over dry my skin or make it oily.
bonus is your skin won't feel tight
doesn't leave my skin dry
i wouldn't say i have oily or dry skin
i just might use it as a body wash
leaves very little makeup on my skin when i go over it with toner
i got this for my boyfriend who tends to have oily skin in the summer
however i tried it on my normal-dry skin
i always have troubles removing all of my mascara even though it isn't waterproof
really like the way i can feel my pores tightening when i use this
normal skin everywhere else on my face so findng a cleanser that works well all over without stripping my skin is difficult
i find the alternative really maintains the drier parts of my combo-oily skin
that maybe because jurlique doesn't use harsh chemicals
really work it into your skin
using this only when i wax or use foundation really keeps the acne at bay without drying out my already dry skin
too drying for that
it doesn't feel heavy on your skin.
it blends in so well into the skin it doesn't feel too greasy
it helps so much to get rid of my dry patches without my t zone being too oily or breaking me out
this is such a good oil if you have large pores!
this nighttime oil is perfect for dry skin.
would highly recommend it if you have dry skin
did not get oily at all
only problem is that it made my eyes burn
my skin has not been nearly as oily as it usually is
3-5 drops pressed into your skin is just enough when used with moisturizer
it's a hot mess in the little packet if you don't realize how shear
it doesn't feel oily at all
rather than trying to strip my skin of the oil
i find i usually need almost twice as much in order to get the drier patches between my eyebrows
even though my skin can be oily
when i'm drier in the winter though
plus with my dry skin i always had face flakes
this oil really did make my skin less red
i let that soak in for a moment
the combination has really helped even out the oiliness that results from too-dry skin
fun fact: oily skin may mean oily skin
before using this product i had issues with dry flakey skin
dry patches on my face as well as some issues with my make up not going on very smoothly
didn't dry my skin out in the process
in the cold dry weather this does wonders for my skin
it's a great dry oil that doesn't make an "oily" skin
i sometimes will have acnes around my tzone
after i start to use this skin oil
i didn't buy the matching cream because it was suggested for combination/oily skin
if it's as gentle as the serum i may have to try it
its perfect for us oily girls no leftover residue no heavy feeling
if i need a bit more i combine it with the oil free cream
i can't believe this oil has saved my oily skin!!
it does leave my skin a little oily/greasy in the morning
which my skin usually doesn't tolerate
amazingly even though i used an oil on my face
my skin was not oily or greasy at all
if your skin is combination
smooth the oil into your face with the other
s – which is difficult when you’re doing the oiling-your-face thing
it is not super greasy or drying just perfect.
it doesn't make me oily throughout the day
it's not greasy feeling like other oils
then foams up on your face so be careful applying around your eyes because the foam can get drippy
had been thinking about adding this to help perk up my dull winter skin
it bubbles lightly like i have not experienced before
after you wash it off
you can really feel it cleaning your skin out
which i never get compliments on my skin
let it breathe a little bit
i could feel a heating
it had such a nice tickle to my face immediately upon application
it's one of those "break glass in case of skin emergency" kind of products
i couldn't believe my eyes, when i washed it off.
this is a great mask for those times when your skin looks tired
when a skin care can make my gross skin look good im all in
a super clean feeling all without excessive drying
my skin tone was as if i had i just put on a primer too
my combination skin was getting crazy dry
needless to say that i've finally found a moisturizer that not only works with my skin
does not leave my skin oily
it gives me enough moisture.
this cream doesn't make me feel greasy or breakout
if you can have a face cream that is your soul mate
if it's sitting on top of your skin
not irritating at all if you have sensitive skin
the pot thing is really annoying- i prefer pumps to keep the ingredients fresh
the older i get (44), the drier i get.
my face was more than dry
asked the girls that were working "what they use to keep hydration in their skin in such a dry dry area of the u
it doesn't leave my face too shiny
knowing i have dry skin
after getting the dry skin off
i've never found a moisturizer i've liked before because they leave my skin greasy or smell too strong
it really helped keep my skin from becoming too dry
like it just got a drink of water infused into it
more oily in the summer
heavy that i only wear it to bed
i wouldn't recommend this for someone with very oily skin as it is pretty intensive
this will be your miracle in a jar
when my skin tends to be on the drier side
i cannot seem to find another product that moisturizes my skin like the extra repair does
as someone with extremely dry
if i was feeling a bit drier i just use it as a primer for a heavier cream
my t zone didn't look as oily as other creams
i feel that it keeps my face not super dry
find that a lot of them just don't cut it on hydration
i've also noticed my dry patches completely go away after i use it
if it's not enough moisture
i do get oily sometimes in my t zone with dry patches
this doesnt dry me out
some spots get super oily through the day
you can actually see it soak into the skin instead of just sitting on top
i just thought i could get away with using it whilst having acne prone skin
it's my number 1 go to when my face feels dry.
i don't like heavy cream on my face though it is dry at my age
my face gets so oily
i am still oily
get dry patches here
it does not leave my face slick or greasy at all.
i hate products that make me feel oily this doesn't it feels like silk on my h
it does not leave a sticky residue on my face
or my skin will break out
as a gift because he has dry skin
i can see this being suitable for people with oily skin too
not oily or heavy at all.
i'd rather use this cream on my hands.
during summer it could feel a bit oily after
it doesn't feel heavy on my face at all.
i didn't feel any dry spots on my cheeks.
when i used this product it did sting a little bit
didn't use it since i thought it would be too heavy for my combo/oily almost 60 skin that still breaks out when irritated
my skin tends to be on the drier side
it was so dry, i was actually in pain!
i love going to bed at night smelling like whatever i applied on my face or skin
you only need the tiniest bit to cover your face.
no more dry spots and no greasiness either!
it is not oily
this product did not make my skin tingle or burn
doesn't quite get every pore
it was slightly difficult to tell if it was all washed off
this mask did not irritate my skin at all!
didn't irritate my skin in the least
breakouts when the weather seems to change or go up
doesn't dry our your skin as much
you only need a thin layer so it lasts forever!
i leave it on for about 15-20 minutes because that's how long it takes to completely dry on my skin
didn't seem to irritate my skin
this wasn't too drying or tightening like some masks i've tried
let it sit in until it starts to look chalky
healthy glow as soon as i wash it off
i like to use a pore strip before using this mask to great a really great deep clean
doesn't dry my skin out
i would not recommend this for someone with very dry skin
this doesn't make me break out or burn my skin
it does not make your face overly tight
which is a very good sign that a masque is doing what it should be'clearing pores
my acne dies down a little whenever i use it
i love that you can literally see the oil being absorbed
every time i use this mask my skin feels so clear after
also love how it dries quick !
throughout the day my skin will be less oily
as if you have put your face in the healing mud on a sea shore
it doesn't appear to set out my skin
i wanted a nice face product that would draw out impurities built up from the week without being too drying
wouldn't be too moist or else it would clog the pores in my t-zone
or just dull overall i put this mask on
i love that it doesn't have chemicals
if you do have dry skin
this mask doesn't irritate or burn my skin at all
doesn't leave my skin feeling like a desert like 90% of other masks
my skin was extra oily this summer which made my pores a real hassle to the point where i could literally feel them on my face
my favourite thing about this mask is the little holes it makes when it drys on your skin
kept looking at my skin for an unhealthy amount of time
get oily in my t-zone"
i will say this coupled with the thirsty mud mask over night
however my extremely dry skin had left me with very few options that don't leave my face flaky
it makes my skin less congested without drying me out or causing my sensitive skin to go berzerk like it does with other detox masks
loved how it dried on my face
doesn't dry out my skin
once it drys i can actually see little dark spots where it has sucked the oil out of my pores
it does dry fast
it helps when my skin is having a more oily
and i love how easy it is to wash off.
i swear to you that it made them smaller my skin felt fresh
it dries relatively fast as you spread it so do it quickly
i love how it dries so you know when to wash it off
in the form of huge under-the-skin pimples in places i normally don't have them
i find that after using my mask my skin even seems less red
it doesn't leave my skin parched after application
well worth the money if you are looking to detox the skin
it is a great exfoliator for winter months when they dry skin gets bad
great to use once or twice a week to really detox your skin
it can be hard to find masks that actually improve my skin without irritating it
it cleared them up very quickly without over-drying my skin
this mask didn't dry out my skin one bit
i love how i can see the little marks where the mask has pulled impurities from my skin
sometimes fifteen if i want a good skin detox
we all have different skin types ranging from oily to excessively dry
helps control oily spots on my combination skin without drying the rest of my face
i think i may try steaming my pores open before applying it so the product can *really* get in there
it didn't dry out my skin like a lot of products do
it doesn't dry out my skin like other masks.
it gets rid of my flakiness.
it's amazing as soon as you wash it off i noticed all the blackhead on my nose disappeared
because i have dry
then i decide to put on a very thick layer
cooling feel like never before
it might not be the choice if your skin is super oily
i think this mask would help anyone with congested pores
is not drying at all
does not dry out or irritate my face.
i find it helps to keep my skin clear
i find it less drying than all other clarifying masks i've tried
doesn't get dry and tight, which i like.
this product works best if you steam your face first or our just out of the shower so your pores are open
for some people any kind of purifying mask may cause a few white heads a week later from pulling all of the clogged pores out
i usually wash it off with some water
not only i had dry patches
i recommend this product to anyone with dry patches
i do not have any dry flakes at all
your skin can still breathe
you don't have to rinse it off
it's good for your whole face when you need a moisture boost
i wouldn't have thought i would like it since my skin tends to be oily
i doesn't make my skin more oily
this is the only one that really saturated the skin around my nose through the winter
one word of warning if you leave it on for an extended period you must wash your face before you apply foundation or tinted moisturizer or you will have flaky bits on your face
living in chicago where the weather can get to dangerously low temperatures
it doesn't make me oily
it wont make your skin oily even you wear it whole night
i think this will be my go to winter dryness help
t does need to be rinsed off
wouldn't use this as an overnight mask because it would muck up my pillowcase
you can even put a generous amount around the eye area without irritation
applied this mask in just the dry areas before bed
i notice right after using the mask i'm less oily
it did not impress me more than other charcoal masks
so this doesn't strip my skin as hard as other charcoal based masks
it also seem to hardly dry
my skin look even and fresh after using it.
i really hate that mask where you have to peel the mask off your face after
a staple product that should be in your routine if you have oily skin/enlarged pores
i started breaking out horribly due to heat/sweat/stress
the only things i'm not crazy about is for me it's a bit hard to apply in a consistent thickness on my face
i only use this on my nose because of how strong the mask is
my skin doesn't seem to get as oily anymore
great for combo-oily skin to get rid of that looming layer of oil
this doesn't burn or stings.
it sucks all the oil out of your skin
it is not greasy
while it is not too drying either
i kind of wish it was a peel off mask because those are so satisfying
i can't say this will work as well for dry skin
the clinique mask did not irritate my skin at all
i don't feel like i have as much excess oil
the drier parts of my face feel fine, too.
it dries very quickly which makes it easy to use.
to anyone that rated "no" on my review for the clinique acne solutions oil-control mask: hopefully you will someday get some humor into your dry life
it doesn't dry me out at all
it really just dried out my skin
dried out my dry spots bad
don't put it on your dry spots you will definitely need to moisturize
you can literally feel like all the dirt is being pulled from yours pores
i wouldn't recommend for dry skin.
i actually have normal/dry skin
when you wash it off it's the oddest sensation it's like you can feel air on your face as if a layer of grime has been lifted up
do this in the shower after washing your face
it is worth it to make your face much cleaner
this is perfect to use once a week just to get the oils
huge pores just make me look even worse
because it can kind of dry your skin once its off
this mask has helped my oily skin if i use it the day of
right when i rinse it off my skin is tight
it is not thick.
i feel like a lot of reviews make it out to be this super thick goopy beauty oil
in a matter of days my skin was completely clear of any dry patches
my skin has become super dry to the point of dry patches
i quickly turned to sunday riley flora oil knowing that this oil will work wonders for my dry skin
my dry skin needed a heavy oil in order to revive it from all the retin-a usage
this is a heavy oil, as in not a dry oil.
every so often i'll overdo it with the retin-a or lose the moisture battle to the winter
this is not my daily face oil.
if your dry skin battle is less extreme
my skin is too dry to use only one product
i've never been one to have oily skin
my fresh seaberry oil so much that my face looks very oily
with the vib sale decided to take the plunge on flora because it said its for dry very dry skin
keep in mind this flora oil is for dry skin.
the other two didn't even come close to moisturizing my face as well as the flora does
i keep using it in the mornings under or mixed with my foundation because it makes my skin
found it was too much oil for my skin
my moisturizer absolutely glides on over it like no other oil i have ever tried
this is the best oil/serum for normal/ dry skin especially those of us who want some help in the anti- aging dept
it seriously makes my skin glow like no other sunday riley oil has yet
cannot use this overnight without my skin being itchy the next day
i am not dried out
when i give my face a quite rinse off
my skin may look oily or even normal if you looked at me
this products (for me) sucks as a wash off mask.
my skin would feel the same once i washed it off
i wouldn't wake up with my skin feeling dry or tight in the morning
figured why not just use a thin layer in the morning
as a wash off mask, not so much.
with such sensitive skin having something so moisturizing that doesn't break you out is a heaven send
absolitely recommend to all of those with dry skin
and no more oily skin either!
smoothe like soooo smothe i couldn't stop touching my face i use this as a mask twice a week
i do not feel this mask is sticky at all
leave my face drier
the winter air is so dry.
dry winter my face becomes very dry
my face does not look tired or dull.
i needed a quick mask to hydrate my skin since i was planning to go out
it didn't burn when wearing
in particular when the weather gets colder
this doesn't make my skin any oilier
it also doesn't take long to dry
it might be nice to have around during those hot texas summers too
every time i find something new disagrees with my occasionally bratty dry skin
a lot of cleansers that remove makeup as good as this one does do tend to burn or irritate my eyes
i can slather this all over my lids without any problems whatsoever
this might not be for you as it is heavily fragranced
the best part about this cleansing balm/oil is that it doesn't leave a greasy oil film on your skin like some oils do
i wouldn't recommend using any cleansing oil near your sensitive eyes
the solid to a liquid means that it won't be leaking all over your stuff if you need to throw it into a bag for an overnight
if you read the label it definitely says you will be left with a lotion-like layer
some people like hard water over soft
the one thing i didn't like its that it clogs my sensitive bathroom drain
my sink has always bad issues
i actually like the clinique balm because its not an oil
this doesn't make me excessively oily or anything
i am in the 1% of the population where coconut oil makes me break out
it mositurizes at the same time which i love because i use retin a which dries my skin out
so you can work the product into your skin
loved this to remove make up when skin was dryer.
now that my skin is a bit oiler i like to just use the make up eraser towel
you literally need a dab like oil so a little goes a long way
for normal or dry skin this is a treat
i do feel like there is some residue
i like using erborian so my skin doesn't get too dry
so you don't need to put your fingers in the jar
i can only recommend for normal to dry skin because that's what i have
it does leave an oily texture on your face after use
i usually use albolene cold cream to wash my face morning
what i love about cold cream
this way my skin gets a deeper clean than with cold cream
which you don't wash off
this you can apply to dry skin
if i don't rinse off very well
doesnt get in my eyes like coconut oil used to even though i really rub this over my eyes to get the makeup off
the one downside is that it leaves my face a little greasy right after- i only wear it at night so that it has time to soak into my skin
when this one's empty i'm sure i'll be purchasing a third tub too
it seems strange that it isn't your typical cleanser that you would moisten your skin first
i remove most of my makeup with a cleansing cloth then grab some product about a dime to nickel sized amount with the spatula that comes with it
worry about products that dry out or irritate skin
fresh scent that does not irritate your nose or bother you
you work it in over your eyes
i find if i do not add 'enough' water to lather the product on my skin
try to rinse if off right away
(it seems more like a oil in a gel form to me.)
you do have to be careful-- really careful on the eye lid
was happy with it until i noticed it was drying my skin out
if you're naturally oily, fine, but i trend dry.
it does melt on your dry skin as you work it in
i still put some of my boscia sake balm afterward
then follow up with this balm to get any excess makeup off
still don't have a holy grain one
doesn't leave a residue like some other oils
doesn't take my eye make-up off as well as other oils i've tried
i found it to be a little drying though.
i feel like balm make up removers are really good for dry skin which is why i tend to use them
does the job of taking off all my make up even when i use my illamasqua eye liner which is practically a tar
i just make sure to rinse it out completely now
my face is no longer dry, and i'm so happy :)
clean the skin better if there's no make up on
then add warm water to face
let me start off by saying that my skin is incredibly dry
it is a dry skin must have.
though i admit it does feel a bit weird initially rubbing this onto dry skin
it won't burn them if you accidentally get too close
then you add water
it will save your skin.
no need for water........heaven!
there is no greasy film afterwards
this stuff is a lot thicker than most cleansing oils when you apply it to the skin
the only reason i'm not giving 5 stars is that it didn't transform into a silky cleanser after
anyhow it was less noticeable after i dried my face which usually never happens after just using face wash
when you wash your face with this first you can move on to a cleanser
this oil is just meant to break down oils
then apply it to my dry face
rub them together before massaging my face for another minute or two [it should look milky white on the face at this stage due to the water which emulsifies with the oil balm]
then i rinse my face at least 3 times until the water is absolutely clear
doesn't burn or sting on my combination skin
my face can sometimes get itchy
my skin doesn't have dry patches anymore.
doesn't feel like it would cleanse because it is a solid oil
this is wonderful for those who have really dry skin during the winter
i did a toner swipe just to see.
you only need a little to cleanse your face with.
make sure your fingers aren't wet if you do choose to scoop it out with your fingers
because it will mess up the texture of the product in your jar
will make your eyes burn
too much or too little will cause the balm to leave a heavy residue on your face
i think i will stick to my liquid
let me start by saying i have moderate to oily skin
then if you add water it becomes a light
if used properly really breaks up
almost as if it is a liquid face lift.
i am so oily you could fry an egg on my face.
horrible that i would rather take the oily skin
i take care of my skin
what i like about this is that it doesn't feel as drying like mattifying primers like mufe or becca
it doesn't cause my makeup to drag like those ones
oily or combination : get it now
since the price is a little high for just an everyday face scrub
i will say that this face creme is thick-- thick like you either put on too much or feel like you didn't use enough to distri
its so worth it i got the eye cream as well
have good skin from being out of the sun
unfortunately i find out virtually every eye cream has shea
unfortunately it dried my under eye area making it look even worse
no heavy greasy feel just light moisture.
even then it doesn't overly dry my skin
my skin is normal with oily spots on my t-zone
so oily skinned folks out there may like this better than dry skinned
my pores are not as clean, even after a day.
when my pores are bothering me
or until i notice my pores looking large again
there's something very luxurious about massaging the formula into your skin for a few minutes
for a stick i found it a little messy to use.
i used it every other day in order to prevent my skin from getting dry
not a liquid/gel/foam whatever so less chance of a mess
i loved how i didn't have to dig the wash out of a jar with my long nails
it's actually pretty difficult to spread on wet skin
then go in with a wet face brush
i can literally feel it pulling the blackheads out of my face when i use it
doesn't irritate my skin at all
it goes on very sticky
its not a scrub or anything
then splash some water on your face
this stick lasts forever
rub it anywhere on my face for precise application
i don't wipe it directly on my face for fear of contamination especially if i have a breakout
massaging the product in as if i were going to wash with it
i guess i was pressing too hard against my face just like how you use deodorant under your arms because there was this black
i never get the stick wet
have no issues with "ruining the whole thing into a globby mess
doesn't leave my face dry
it doesn't dry the skin.
i prefer to use it outside of the shower
as it tends to get a little too soft if it gets too wet
it can be a little drying for me if used daily
which can range from really try--to really oily
don't use too much water
you want it to stay a bit thick
t dried it out a little
also really great for oily skin as i find my skin stays dry for around 6-10 hours after i use this
it really does make your skin feel super duper clean
even though you're supposed to rinse
you may want to use a darker washcloth
as the charcoal will take a bit of washing to get out
there is so much moisture restored in my skin
because i've read that it tends to be drying if you use it everyday
it doesn't over dry my face.
the trick is making sure not to get the product itself wet
wet my face first then dried my h
used a q-tip to basically scrape the top of the roller to get the amount of product i want
i keep this product in the refrigerator to help keep it from getting soft
he keeps it in his shower as he says it can get a bit messy if he uses it at the sink
i find this stick dries it out a bit too much
this is great because they're no bar container or fears of pumps leaking or any leaking at all because of its solid state
it's also helped cut down the amount of oil my face tends to produce
if you put the cap on when the bars wet
get my clarisonic brush wet first
i let the cleanser stick dry out over night
if it gets on clothes or towels it does leave a black residue
my skin feels extremely clean after i do think if you have dry skin it will strip everything off so you should use a very dense moisturize afterwards
i like the fact that my skin doesn't feel dry afterwards
no other products actually cleans everything either
also made my face less oily.
also have super dry areas especially in dry winter times
i pretty much use it only at night after a day of wearing heavy makeup or if i was feeling especially dirty
make sure you rinse well.
my skin type:seriously dry in my t-zone
yet oily at the same time?
struggle to find products that will deep clean without irritating
the product does not work so well if you apply it after wetting your skin
changing how often i do or don't exfoliate
if you use a clarisonic it helps if you just wet the brush
it dried my skin out so much
that they're literally applying it like a glue stick to their skin — no
it is too soft to use directly on your face
probably not for dry skin.
then i just use some water
this did a better job of clearing out my pores than any mask ever has
just saying though: while my face is a bit oily it is also sensitive
your face needs to be properly wet to use it
if it's not wet enough
it is a bit hard to just apply it as a stick so you should wet your face before using the product or else it will be thick
kind of stick to your face like mud
the irony is that my skin dries up very easily so the products that work really well for acne-prone skin types make my skin really dry
t takes a while to apply it all over your skin
one thing to keep in mind is to really wet your face first
this stuff sticks where you rub it
my troublesome oily pregnant areas feel so clean
if you moisture after you will be just fine
while it looks like it is the size of a tube of chapstick that would easily maneuver around your nose
i don't rub it directly on my face
put it on my face before i wet it
you have to work it a little to get it to spread evenly over your whole face
so you had to dry your h
s before putting it on your wet face
f you splash onto the sink while rinsing off your face you will get grey water on it
i put it directly on my face dry then add warm water to create a foam
i don't wind it up much at all.
if i used it more i think my skin would get dry.
however, it is very messy to apply.
that sit on the skin
even oily-skinned people can get dry patches
thick creams didn't seem to do anything
i don't care as long as i feel moisturized without having a heavy layer on my face
it might not enough for super dry skin during winter i assume
leave me greasier than before
i don't know how this watery gel works
on its own it may not provide enough moisture
doesn't take much to smooth on
not only could i feel a difference immediately in my skin dryness
i would definitely recommend this if your skin needs a boost of moisture
you won't want your face to feel heavy or clogged up with a thick moisturizer
doesn't leave my face tacky or too wet
so far this past winter i have needed to use this with a creme as well because it wasn't quite moisturizing enough
it gets dry afterward
it doesn't have that sticky feeling
it just feels like my bare skin like nothing is on
i don't know if this is heavy duty for dry skinned girls
refreshing when you pat it on your skin
i can't get over how great my skin texture is
this gel is perfect for the humid weather i live in
it's just enough moisture
have been using it for a cool down sunburn relief too
felt a cotton pad would absorb most of it.
face was not sticky
this is perfect for oily skins that just want a little moisture
not sticky or greasy
doesn't feel heavy or greasy at all
i usually use fresh seaberry oil
it doesn't make my skin oily or break out
maybe on oily skin it feels like this
perfect for dry or combination skin.
my skin type is normal with seasonal dry.
it doesn't break me out or cause overproduction of oil
as it was light enough to not mess with my bb cream
i would recommend this oil to those who are super oily
don't like the greasy texture that takes forever to absorb u must ask for a sample
does not feel oily after applied
this is definitely the best oil that i have used on my dry skin
it's not as dry as it use to be
the only con is that my face feels sticky
like ithe oil never completely sinks into the skin
i also like the feeling of having a little layer of honey on my face
is certainly not as extreme as actually having honey on your face
the consistency is much more like a silky liquid on not so much like an oil
sometimes i feel like face oils don't spread very well
t's hard to find a facial oil that doesn't make my face feel oily
your skin just changes as you get older
i used it after the shower so my pores were nice
my face is so much more glowy than it was before!
dry on my face
i lightly work it in to my skin
you don't have to slather this stuff on
leave it on for the 30 minutes your skin will look georgeous
one is supposed to scrub in circular motions as you're applying it to your face than leave it on for 20 minutes
besides the gravity mud this stuff has to be my favorite
where i have dry spots they get really flaky
make sure to scrub at the dry spots before leaving it on for the time it says
please note that if you have large pores
my skin has not dried out
it's great if you have a bit of dry or dead skin on your face
find that i have to be gentle when rubbing it in
if you feel your skin is looking dull
doesn't over dry it plusleaves it really healthy
or the compliments that i get on my skin after using it
it really gets rid of dullness without stripping or leaving skin dry
it does take the dullness away
it didn't irritate my skin at all
imagine it would clean my skin just as well
you wash your face like normal.
let it dry for 10 minutes, then rinse it off.
after just a few uses this will really brighten up your skin
your skin will tighten a little after using so definitely follow it up with moisturizer
i end up having to use my moisturizer or the thirsty mud mask afterwards because it dries me out a bit
does not dry out my skin after the use
this mask is a must have in my skin care routine
leave it on overnight--it feels like the silkiest
noticed they just needed moisture
i would recommend this to someone who is looking to lighten dark spots
not only is it great for exfoliating if you want really smooth fresh looking skin
as you rub it in
it does dry out my skin
does it break out my overly sensitive
it may sting your skin slightly if you rub it aggressively
just make sure to follow up with sun screen
everyone in my house has found a use for these wipes
how they have an abrasive side
not to be confused with a make up remover
you might want to use a product to remove the top layer of make up
then use these to get a real deep down clean
they are not drying at all
it doesn't dry out my skin using it 1-3 times a day
i would recommend these to anyone with oily skin
be sure not to let it contact your lips as it does exfoliate
after using these my skin is not as oily after i've worn my make up for a while
did not rinse it off
in the winter i'm rarely dry i'm mostly oily
then when i used the soft side of the wipe it cleaned off all the dry skin
decided to give it a go as my skin was pretty dry from the cold weather
i absolutely fell in love these wipes are so convenient
its not too harsh
gentle enough for me to use daily.
chest to avoid body acne that he gets if he doesn't wash the sweat off
i steal them from him when i need a little exfoliation a few times a week
because of my dry skin i don't think they'd be good for everyday use
wouldn't recommend it for daytime unless you have super dry skin
since i have such sensitive break- out prone skin
you can feel your skin stretching as it dries
this one actually made my skin feel firmer right from the get go
its magic in a packet ♥♡tip: make sure you rinse it off really good
i take good care of my skin--wash
i love that it has spf 30 because it allows me to skip adding additional sunblock most days
it does burn a little bit on my cheeks when i first apply it
washing it off can be hard sometimes
i feel like a lot of masks have short term benefits like they make your skin feel smooth
would recommend to anyone who has any type of textured skin
i definitely feel it did minimize my pores
even though i don't struggle with texture
this is the mask for you!
apply a hydrating night cream after so my face won't be dried out
it does seem to decrease my dry patches
especially if you have oily skin.
then when you wash it off your skin feels really soft
after i take this mask off my skin is so smooth!
this is the second mask i tried from origins being that my favourite go to mask is the origins charcoal mask which is a stable in my skin care
nothing where you had to devote your life to in order to peel off
this mask doesn't dry me out
after putting on my regular moisturizer i didn't have any bumps or texture at all
i don't feel dry at all
since i have dry skin
this mask did not irritate my skin
it even helped heal my scabs underneath so that the dry part of the scab will come off easier
wow holy moly i've never seen a skin care product work so well on my skin so quickly
it definitely tingles when you first apply it
my skin did not feel dry or tight
most clay masks leave me feeling super dry
it make my skin look so clear
it doesn't leave my skin dried out like lots of other masks
however, it burns really bad on my face at first.
you don't have to scrub your face apart to get it off
it tends to dry on my face
would have given a 5star if it did clean pores a little bit more
it didn't burn my skin
then when the exfoliation get to be too much
not too much for my skin that gets sensitive in the winter
this mask not only smells amazing it also draw out impurities without making my skin feeling tight
it doesn't irritate my skin at all
didn't affect my dry skin
this will dry your skin out even worse right after you use it
i feel like this gets rid of dry spots without over drying
although it does a good job of clearing my pores
it doesn't do much for softening my skin
just washing it isn't enough
all masks will dry you out
this facemask is great because if i just want to wash it off
the day after wearing it i never use any face make up because my skin looks amazing
my skin does not feel dry after
my pores went sooo much smaller after one use
you don't feel any dryness at all
you're suppose to gently rub it off to exfoliate after you let it sit for ten minutes
once i wash it off it literally feels like a baby's
although the description is for smoothing fine lines i use it because it sucks out all my pimples
i constantly break out because my oily skin
could honestly double as a primer if you have normal or dry skin
you don't smell it all day on your face
does not make my face greasy/shiny at the same time
very good for summer if you have combination/oily skin
it not too heavy
it works great on combination skin without overdrying or making my face too oily
it does not leave any sort of white tint that sun screen can sometimes leave
it is non-comedogenic which is great because my skin gets oilier as the day goes on
my oily skin remains shine free for several hours
which i didn't realize was actually drying out my face
otherwise it feels like oily
doesn't make my skin look too shiny or oily
this is good for me when the weather getting a bit cold
when sunny it get a bit oily so not used it too much
kept me moisturized all day without being too thick or greasy
doesn't add more oil to my skin
problem was that it wouldn't really dry out my skin
just around my oily t zone
consequently i'd get dry skin by the end of the day
i can use it all over my combination oily sensitive skin
even with spf not greasy and sticky at all!
it's the only sleeping mask that i've found that clears up my acne so fast
i usually have a problem with overnight masks because i tend to sleep on the side of my face
wouldn't leave any residue on my pillow
i keep them in the fridge.
can easily be used more than once if resealed properly or put into a ziplock
whenever my skin get's flaky i put this mask on before bed
if you put too much mask on your face it will remain tacky
t wasn't prone to drying up so easily
i didn't usually use it as a sleeping mask
please make them in tube or bottle form!
dry skin at times so this product really helps balance all three issues
combination skin so for me to find a product that doesn't irritate me is a huge plus
these go on sticky
as long as you avoid your pillow
it's not that sticky compared to other sleeping masks i've used
etc under the sun trying to control this
sometimes it dries out if i don't stack something on top of it to keep the top from opening
these masks are really great for plane rides where the air is really dry
'll usually come off a plane with dry patches everywhere
try this mask if you have dry skin or if you need soothing on the face
i would recommend putting it in a ziploc bag after so you can reuse
night masks so you dont have to peel or wash off a bunch of clay
i get such dry skin sometimes
i'd really love it if sephora sold them in containers or even tubes
i picked these up the other day just because my skin needed a little bit of nourishment
i didn't break out with my normal to oily skin.
such a great mask to use before bed
it's not resealable so you need to put it in a ziplock or put a item on top of it
there's zero need to wash it off the next morning since there's no residue
they give my skin just enough moisture
are not drying at all
you're not able to reseal it since you're using it multiple times
i keep it in a little ziplock
one little pod lasts you 4-5
i try to make this a habit when my skin is angry
the next day my skin was not as oily as usual
if you're sensitive to smells maybe avoid this particular one
this can calm my skin even in the most horrible break outs or dry spells
doesn't feel sticky on your skin
it saves me so much time in the morning by not having flaking dry skin
i highly recommend this mask to anyone with dry skin
completely takes away all that excess shine
definitely recommend it for anyone with oily skin
wish there was a way to warm it a bit for maximum absorption because it goes on a little cool
my t zone would be all oily
've started using the lancome moisturizer along my t-zone with another on my cheeks when i'm feeling particularly dry
used to hate having to wait for my clinique one to "soak in" before putting my liquid foundation
my makeup stays on all day which is not easy for someone with extremely oily skin like mine
my skin actually feels normal after applying it not drying at all
using powder you need this in your life
i totally recommend this for oily skin!
a must for people with very oily skin
the oil does not irritate
i've always been bad about washing my face
i make sure to add an extra pump of oil just for my eyes
it really has to go directly onto dry skin with dry h
s are already wet
use it on completely dry face
there seems to be a little bit of oil residue when you have wash it off which is probably great for drier skin
it doesn't leave any residue
then use micellar water to make sure i really got everything
it left my face super oil it was hard to rinse off then i found this
i do need to wet my face first before putting this on
you apply only one pump to a dry face
then you add water
i would highly recommend this oil for anyone with dry/normal skin as well as sensitive
if you put it on directly to the waxed area without any water first
then you can just add water
not at all oily.
it doesn't leave a film once you wash it off
doesn't left you skin oily
con is that it leaves my skin way too oily
how it cleans off every bit of make up
said that it does the same thing as those high-end oil cleansers
she also said that when wet
the oil turns into a lotion-like substance which honestly i was skeptical about
fight oil with oil - wait, what?!
is less oily in the long run
however it does cleanse nicely
cleaners tend to make it drier than usual
even though i have oily skin i like for an oil to be my first step when i clean my face
you might think an oil cleanser will make your face oily
i just wouldn't use this as my only face cleanser because it's not that great at cleaning out pores
all you need is 1 pump to gentle massage all over your face
it makes my skin feel so good that i don't need to follow up with any facial wash after rinsing
i love how it turns into a lotion consistency when you add a tiny bit of water
work it over dry skin
i find that this leaves a slight oily residue if i don't finish with purity
so happy that you brought back this cleansing oil
trying this cleansing oil completely changed my mind
without leaving my skin either dry or oily
i tend to get a little oily around my nose
didn't leave my skin feeling the least bit oily
does not burn my eyes
the harder it is to get off my skin
my skin didn't really mesh well with this in the beginning
doesn't even irritate my contacts
i usually go in for a second cleanse just to make sure my skin is extra clean
i've taken a cotton pad with toner on it just to see if if takes up any addition make up
watch your make up melt away
it gets rid of waterproof make up without a problem
just in case the oil still have leftover on your face
then when i added water it turned to a milky type consistency
did not leave a film or dry my skin out
i live in a very dry climate
i find a lot of eye products either too lightweight
or too many active ingredients which irritate my skin
which is great because i have super dry skin
i truly cannot stop touching my skin.
be sure to keep it around your eyes
rinse your face off first thing when you get it
this is one of the few eye treatments that didn't burn or make my eyes water
perfect for my dry skin in the humid nyc summer
you do notice a subtle difference quickly after rinsing it off
this is the first mask that wasn't drying my skin or burning my eyes
when you wash it off
i like to put this on before my makeup because of how it smooths my skin out without making my face overly slippery like the smashbox primer
most important this product has to be used on bare clean dry skin before any other skincare so directly after you would wash
the trick is to not layer many products over it because just like regular tape it can cause the product to slip
this oil does wonders for my skin
be sure you keep it out of the sun
not so dry now
my skin isn't getting oily or dry throughout the day
only draw back is the slight rubber ish smell it can sometimes leave behind
i've always had skin on the drier side
my skin breaks out or gets irritated immediately when it doesn't like the product
the normally dry area
knew my skin wasn't oily everywhere
i don't have to pat my face during the day to absorb excess oil on my t-zone either
this is the cream of dreams if you have super dry skin
tends to dry with change of weather
can hold on to your skin
i always found them way too greasy for my acne-prone face
not so greasy that my oily patches shine like the top of the chrysler building
just make sure your fingers are super clean before you dip them into the product or else you'll leave bacteria in there for the next time you use it
perfect if you have really dry skin.
this product can be applied multiple times a day without feeling greasy or overdone
this is the only moisturizer that i can use twice a day without making my skin feel greasy or oily
tends to not be absorbed as fast
it works perfectly for cny cold winters
does take a minute to completely absorb into my skin though
need some deep moisture this product is it
i've always had issues finding a moisturizer that would work for both dry
oily skin without leaving some parts too dry
some part too oily
it seems to soak into my skin fairly well
always used to have dry patches
i recommend this to anyone with very dry to dry skin
there are a lot of moisturizers that do as soon as they touch my skin
it does feel a bit greasy
it does feel a bit greasy
the one thing that really disappointed me is that applying a primer over this resulted in the product clumping
a must have for even extremely dry skin!
it do leave your skin a little dewy
f you don't like that effect or have grassy skin
during the hot summer days when everyone decides to turn their a/c on full blast my skin becomes very dry as the a/c zaps all the moisture from your skin
it also does not make my sensitive skin break out
sticking with this for my cold weather routine
it makes my face feel so soft without any oily residue
i just get too dry during with winter with dry air
just switched to my summer moisturizer as it is getting warmer in kansas city
doesnt just sit on skin
occasionally my nose when the weather gets really dry
when you wake up you can still feel moisture
as i got older my skin is getting drier on certain parts of my face
doesn't make my skin feel greasy or oily
it an get a little greasy if you put on too much.
didn't really work for me with my severely dry skin
kept going back to it when other moisturizers didn't work
my skin needed that
don't let the stinging feeling or redness turn you off
you feel a little burn
it does however dry out my under eyes to where they are rough
you will feel a "pinch"
the treated area will feel hot for a while
perhaps get something a little more balm like
it feels like a bad sunburn until the next morning
you will feel some burning after a treatment
you will also want a light eye cream
you can mix it in with your foundation
especially if you're dry.
nothing really helped with the dry patches
i can now wear my favorite foundations again without worrying about dryness
doesn't make you look super oily by mid-day
could mix it with my coverfx foundation since it's so thick
makes it too oily pretty quickly
it is more like a dry oil
i tend to dry up extremely fast when wearing makeup very frequently
would deft recommend for those of you who suffer from dry skin
the foundation does not crack or have that greasy heavy cake
dry skin that's response to any problem is to turn red
i love how they absorb into the skin right away
i want to try the other oils now that i dip my feet in the waters of you will
it doesn't leave a greasy finish
my face tends to dry out
still get oily through the day
my skin gets so dry in the winter
with the oil infused my foundation isn't drying out my skin anymore
have tried just about everything out that would help treat red/uneven skin tone
i still feel dry which i add 2 drops
doesn't look oily at all
it doesn't separate my foundation likes other oils do
around my mouth get very dry
red skin you need this in your life
it helps me particularly calm my skin when it dry or have some red patches
- good for humid weather cuz of its light texture
not oily love it love i can use it in place of a primer
oily skin took a turn for the worse
when i say oily
i mean i am oily like even after 2 hours of applying my makeup
it definitely gives a matte finish immediately so at first i felt like i wasn't getting enouh moisture
8 can definitely say it's helped keep my oils down
still give me moisture :
so far i love it for my dryness.
only negative- if you use too much it can feel a little sticky for a while
perfect base for makeup or to help things stay matte on no-makeup days in the humid florida weather
doesn't leave behind any residue
i don't think it will transition in to drier weather
it does go on a little sticky
i woke up not oily like i usually do
does not feel sticky at all
does not leave any residue
your skin seems to have a vendetta to be as dry
i normally get a lot of red dry scab patches from where a pimple use to be from face wash drying my face out so bad
rub it on the areas it needs it
dozens of products to find something that will moisturize my dry skin without causing insane break-outs
i hate greasy formulas or formulas that do not seem to absorb
some days i even skip my primer!
decided to use it today cause my face was feeling so dry
i feel the new gel more to preserve moisture better than before
it may not be super moisturizing if your skin is severely burned
it worked for me in my moderately dry areas
mine was i wish i could find a moisturizer that would hydrate my oily skin without any problems
always have trouble with breakouts because my skin cant h
didn't break me out or make me look like an oil slick either
was searching for a good anti wrinkle cream that wouldn't make my oily skin even more oily
sometimes with an oil under it if i need more moisture
i will say i still need to use a serum underneath this as i have dry skin
it is thicker than i expect
this is the first moisturizer i've ever used that didn't make my face break out
a product that wouldn't cause my skin to become oily
this is the first moisturizer i've ever used that didn't irritate my skin or make me break out
i am 33 with mostly oily
my skin can be a little on the oily side
find during the fall/winter months i need a little extra moisture
which i never really found before with their creams
the reviews on here saying it made you greasy are untrue- you only need a pea size amount to cover your face
i like that it is not greasy and thick.
not only did i not burn due to the sunscreen
cheap skin to try to fix the problem
how many products have you tried that supposedly "melt" into your skin?
even if you have very bad wrinkles
i even feel like it did a way better job than my ptr in wrinkle night cream
this stuff hydrates my skin like nothing else.
my skin was parched due to the very dry air
if you don't have dry skin it will make the perfect moisturizer year round
yes it stings if you are not accustomed to glycolic
you need only a small amount on the provided spatula to cover your entire face
to those who complain about it being greasy
sure it feels like snot when you scoop it out
not oily like it usually is
i get dry/flakiness during this time of year
non-greasy that you can easily apply makeup overtop
always feel like my jar never contains enough
it has never made me oily or break out
i don't really have dry skin
it takes a little bit to dry
my face was dry for so long
this product has given my skin the moisture it was lacking with out over oiling
it seems overly wet, at first, but dries quickly.
my skin needed a serious drink.
doesn't leave an oily residue that i need to let dry or soak in before continuing with my facial routine
if you use to much it will feel oily
it doesn't sting on my skin
always struggle to find a moisturizer that doesn't break me out
somehow even though i have dry skin
my only problem is sometimes when my skin is super dry
i think its going to work great on oily skin
it can be a little "sticky" or tacky on the skin after immediate use
it is moisturizer without being too heavy on the face
is light weight-no gunk for the hot weather of summertime
i can see someone with dry skin not loving it.
if i feel like it's too dry i put another moisturizer over it
never notice anything sticky on my face
my face normally tends to be oily
doesn't leave it oily looking even with the extra moisture
i usually use only a little dab or so for my whole face
it's plenty dry by the time i go to bed
after using this my face is less oily
it is hard to find one that doesn't leave your face like an oil slick
this product does not irritate me or make me more oily
doesn't leave any residue
it can get sticky if you use too much
4 stars because it's more of a night time moisturizer as it makes putting on make up a bit trickier
so light weight and not sticky.
however this is not meant for acne specifically i do enjoy how bouncy my skin is
i think that any burning sensation mentioned in other reviews was probably a result of the glycolic acid high up on the ingredients
i did experience slight burning if i put the moisturizer on really dry patches or down too far down on my neck
because it did not burn once dry patches were repaired
i think it would be great alone on oily skin.
it does feel sticky
protects your skin all through the night no matter how often u tub your face on your pillow/sheets
the only thing to be aware of is that it is a bit alcohol-y in that it burns if you put it on any sort of broken/cracked skin
just power through that burn because by the next day that skin will look gorgeous
i am not a fan of thick creams that sit on my face
creams because they always make me more oily
almost requires another serum or oil to really quench the skin which makes it perfect for people who have combination-dry skin
you really get your money's worth of the product thanks to the texture
this is the best i've ever used for my oily aging skin
for my sensitive combination skin with no severe dry patches living in a desert climate
i could still feel a light bit of the moisturizer hanging on to my skin
it is a perfect night cream for the dry skin people in the driest winter season
it is not sticky5.
this made it really less oily than before
i do get a little bit of a burning sensation if i wash my face to soon to placing it on
it doesn't irritate my skin at all
nothing so bad that it make my makeup patchy or my face stick to my pillow
may feel a bit sticky on the pillow at night
doesn't feel like i am just layering more product on my face
a few minutes after the product absorbs you're good to go
super sensitive/scared that products will break me out
yes it is a bit sticky at first but abates.
i applied before bed as when you first put it on your face the texture may feel a little sticky rather than slick or greasy like other facial moisturizers because of the gel texture
there was no sticky texture or greasy film left on my face like some moisturizers leave especially on dry skin because they don't absorb properly
have been careful not to slather my face in this product
then some setting spray before applying my foundation
it totally has gotten rid of my dry patches.
when the product dries down it's not as moisturizing as the one previous one
i do notice if i don't wash my face in the morning it can look a bit shiny
my skin can get very dry
it doesn't leave it looking oily
i didn't find this eye cream sticky at all.
i did not like the nighttime gel in this product line
this cream will tingle a bit when you put it on
it doesn't leave behind any unwanted texture
t may not be enough for aging or very dry/dehydrated skin types
it absorbs really well and doesn't stay greasy.
have a hard time finding eye creams that work for me
it is not greasy or sticky
otherwise it does have a tendency to be a bit heavy under makeup
when my eye get tired from a long days work it's very soothing
my normal moisturizer wasn't doing jack to help the condition
non-greasy feel when i apply it
it does tingle a bit so might not be right for those with sensitive eyes
the cream does not sting me at all.
do live in a very dry climate however
worth a try if you are not sensitive skinned
do not require significant moisture or live in a dry climate
make sure you keep it in a cool place though this cream is not made to h
it is so hard to find an eye cream that does not use cucumber to depuff
i find it a little runny, but it does soak in.
what i like most is that it doesn't seem to cause too much morning puffiness
not too thick or too watery
can feel it plumping up my skin after i put it on
sometimes i decide to change my eye cream
i would highly recomend this cream for anyone in need of more moisture with out excess oil sitting on the surface of the skin
i require that it not make my eye area look greasy or shiny
i will get probably 100 applications out of this little tub
my eye area is sensitive this gives me just enough moisture
however, i do not have very dry skin.
some products that i have used actually leave my skin feeling dryer
like get a decent amount of sleep
also, wish it was a squeeze tube or pump?
may be too light if you need moisture around your eyes
under my eyes tends to get dry
frankly i'd love it to have a bit more residue like a heavier eye cream
not sticky after you message for a while.
for years i couldn't use any eye cream.
my eye area gets really dry in the winter
i get them from lack of sleep
it really keeps those bags under
the rich version like many other cream out there helps the dryness
it is not holy water
this is wonderful if you have realy dry skin around the eye areas
i don't recommend it if you have oily skin
i just take a little dab, and it goes a long way.
t might not be enough if you have extremely dry skin
i don't beleive greasy heavy eye creams necessarily deliver results
they can be irritating to my eyes
i can feel it on all day long yet it does not "sweat" into the eyes
other eye creams that i have tried were so thick the cream would actually start to form little crumbles
it is no longer too dry or too oily
get get the larger size because it's very moisturizing for my combination skin with out over doing it i also notice notice my skin is much softer
it gets so dry it hurts this fixed everything in one night
i love this cream is not greasy at all
very rich without being oily.
there are many creams i can't use on my face without breaking out or feeling greasy
i think that if i had used it for a few weeks it would give me the moisture i need for my dry skin
it does feel a little sticky
great for people with normal to dry skin.
really different... not your average cream.
did not make my combo skin oily at all
this is great for any dry patches
a quick fix for any rough spots you might have on your face- for me it's the sides of my nose
it was too rich for my skin at the time
i returned this product because i think it was too heavy for my combination-acne prone skin
for everyone with normal to dry skin
my skin break out easily
when i smooth it on my skin drinks it up
my face always gets dry during the winter weather
on particularly windy or dry days
not greasy at all
it is non-greasy
this is the only creme i have found that actually balances out my skin
pick this one over the precious cream with the spf added to it--the spf tends to make the cream a bit "sticky
i seem to break out with every anti-aging moisturizer i've every tried-dozens of them-until i tried this
this cream is too oily to me
however i believe it can moisturize well when my skin is in its dry
has commented on how pretty my freshly washed face with immortelle precious applied is
otherwise tend to be oily
really takes care of those dry spots on the face
i live in a very dry climate
if someone has dry skin you should try this for this winter
my face still feels dry sometimes even if i have a combination skin
it absorbs quickly and does not feel oily at all.
my skin gets drier i'm sure it will get me thru the winter
even though i live in dry co
doesn't leave an oil slick on my skin
doesn't cause my skin to break out
i live in hawaii where the air is often humid
it's not greasy, or drying.
very light-- beware the product goes bad easily in the heat as i've noticed from some of the testers in a few loccitane shops without a/c
although i have skin that tends to the dry side
while it did help with my flakey skin a bit
it thoroughly absorbs into your skin for easy application of make up afterward
even my oily/combination skin just sucks it in
now i can experience that again with this effective smoothing l'occitane immortelle precious cream
it is not greasy
if you leave it on too long it will dry the skin
smooth after you wash it off
by the time i get in the shower it's dry
then i wet it with my wet h
letting it nearly dry then lathering it up
my blackheads have proven nigh impossible to get rid of
i feel this is almost the lazy girls' way to wash your face while receiving additional benefits
my dry skin loves this as it doesen't make me dry
if i'm too lazy to hop in the shower this stuff does an amazing job of taking off my makeup without over drying my skin
ill often let it sit whilst i brush my teeth in the morning as well
cool when its applied
'pat masks feel so dry
it does a very good job soothing dry areas
this is a nice quick mask to apply in the evening that also cleanses your face
i did not find it drying
when it's done drying
best part is the "face wash" that foams up at the end :
breakouts after moving from a dry winter climate to a hot humid summer climate
which a lot of clay masks tend to do to my skin
i tend to be messy over the sink
then i simply wash it off
you feel your skin tighten a bit about ten minutes
i don't think this mask makes a huge difference in my skin when i use it compared with other clay masks
not dry at all
it doesn't leave my skin dry like other masks.
usually have pretty normal skin
i should say it does leave your skins very soft with out over drying your skin
sometimes i'll use it as a mask
then you can wash it off
it doesn’t dry out my skin at all
i love that they're gentle and remove oil.
it's nice to not have to spend a bunch of time washing the mask off
they are really thick
bright after using these although it feels a little dry
they're a little bit drying
white for any areas that are sensitive or tend to get irritated
or if you have really dry skin
they did dry my skin out
didn't find the pink mask to be that effective
just like a clay mask should.
the more i used it the better i felt like it worked specially when my skin needs a fast facial gets all of my makeup residue off
this is a long time for me as my pores clog very easily
not just the quality of my skin
somedays my skin is so oily that i can blot a lot of oil off throughout the day
i would've wanted this to be more like a rinse off mask
my tzone / oily areas are not extremely oily anymore
don't dry my skin out
simply used this product instead of my typical face wash
not too much that it makes your skin super greasy
don't know what possessed me to buy this mask-to-cleanser set as it appears to need more effort than your usual cleanser
i put them on my dry skin
so your face doesn't get all sucked out of moisture
the foaming part makes you really feel like you are getting all your makeup/dirt off your face
you add water to it
they leave the skin matte but not dry.
when you wash off they do become foamy/creamy which is a nice change
use mask to wash off make up when dry
i usually apply to clean skin
don't use the green mask if you have sensitive/dry skin
usually about 10 min then i wash it off
being someone with dry
its surprising to read that these dried out peoples skin
work well and don't irritate skin.
oily as the day goes by
so easy to wash off
depending on which zones are drier/oily than the other
doing some research i was looking to switch it up from clairosonic refreshing gel wash
i needed something to get my skin back in shape
they dry down too much
it doesn't strip skin further or irritate it
after a while i noticed that it's just really cleaning your skin
this cleanser foams a ton with very little product on just a few drops of water or even just rubbing it in your h
it threw me off a little when i rinsed it off because it almost made my face water resistant haha
you don't really need to actually splash your face it's more like keeping your fingers wet while working in the product more
the only thing is sometimes it make my dry skin a little drier
you only need the tiniest amount to get great foam
doesn't make skin dry or oily.
it doesn't dry out my skin or cause any breakouts
i wouldnt recommend this to those with dry or sensitive skin
make sure to wet your face first
it is pretty drying
if your skin tends to be normal or oily
i don't think i'll repurchase it once my current one is used as i tend to stick with slightly heavier serums
just make sure you rub it in well to stimulate your skin with it
i notice that it doesn't look oily
it is so hydrating i don't feel the need for a full pump
this does not transfer onto the skin
i'll try anything to help my extremely dry skin.
i can feel it help firm my skin around my eyes
i would get flakey patches when i use foundation
the gold sparkle is really pretty when you pump it out
it's not at all noticeable once you apply it on your face other than that you look really dewy
the dropper doesn't do a good job at picking up any of the product
so you have to dip like 3 times to get enough to cover you face
it never tried me out since it's like a lotion
the product is too thick for the pump
if needed on my oily skin
except for my moisturizer cream which i sometimes apply either more than one layer of or one out of a few that i choose from depending on how my skin feels dryness-wise that day
i make sure too really massage this product into my skin well
is not just sitting in some sort of layer of products on my face
didn't feel at all sticky
make up glides easily over without pilling so was great for both am
so you get twice the use from a jar
one pad really allows me to "treat" my face
my skin tends to get oily by mid-day
my face doesn't look greasy
it can be a little sticky i think because it is a thin gel texture
you can apply a very thin layer without using much product
it does really melt into your skin
t ends up feeling more like you are applying a liquid
i love how it comes out in a foam
spf so just make sure you put one on top or pair with a foundation with spf
i can wear this cream alone without foundationit makes my face look really healthy plus i no longer have dry skin
except not as saturated
as a refresher around my eyes or where i may have a dry
my skin does not feel dry anymore
feel good when you roll it under your eyes
love this eye cream especially cold in the fridge
keep it in the fridge for extra cold effect.
it goes on cold
putting it on cold is the best
almost like the glow glow hydrating mask where you can feel it slip off when you wash your face in the morning
does not make my skin look greasy even after hours
my skin gets red from just about everything
gets worse with coffee or alcohol
however my t-zones occasionally get oily
or at least not excessively dehydrated
because with the hot weather
easier to cover with foundation or i'm even super okay now with going out in a bare face or using lighter coverage foundation again
always assumed that any product would wok
it doesn't feel thick or heavy
not only does it help soothe my skin
this cleanser does not make my face feel over cleansed or dried out
it didn't make my skin feel dry or tight
this dries out my skin a little too much
i would imagine people with oily skin would benefit from it
isn't too drying on my skin
when i'm done washing my face there is this amazing cooling effect
not heavy or greasy
is just the right amount of moisture for fall/winter
don't wash your face in the morning you can look a little shiny
usually if i don't use a moisturizer my skin gets really bad
does not have yucky ingredients i avoid
it is not sticky
i used this with my regular facewash from whole foods before eventually switching to lancer for that too
i put it on every few days as i find my skin gets too dried out
this product does not break me out or cause excessive oil production
years of experience i know over drying is an extremely common mistake ppl with problem skin make
it tingles a little when you 1st apply
it definitely has a tingle when you apply
this is the only one that doesn't make my eyes water
the results clearly proved me wrong--this stuff really works to reduce brown spots/sun damage
can create an oily feel
mportant that your skin is properly moisturized on a regular basis otherwise it will not absorb
it would come off in like a weird paste
they all leave me oily or dry
even better if i've put on a little bit of argan or marula oil earlier in the evening
putting a thin layer of this on before bed makes things a bit less greasy while still retaining all the goodness of whatever i put on my face before
so products that are intended to keep you matte end up drying me out
making me even more oily
it keeps my face from getting oily throughout the day
i think it helps balance out your skin
someone who is very oily
the gel consistency is what keeps my skin in check when it's still oily
hate anything with the slightest oily texture.
i love the rest of the products in the ceramidin line because they really are deeply hydrating
i don't necessarily love the thick feel of the original cream formula on my face during the day
my normally dry skin can be flaky in some areas
literally feels like your skin is literally drinking water
loved the quick absorbing and not oily finish.
not too light not too heavy.
those with dry skin will underst
you wont feel like your skin is moisturized because it absorbs very quickly if applied correctly
usually by the end of the day i'm oily
at night i add a drop of oil to give the extra moisture
i also use it before i go to bed to give my face some extra moisture while i sleep
dry skin in the winter time
it did not hurt as much even outside in the cold weather
i mix it with my spf josie maran for extra moisture especially since it's been chilly my skin needs a lil boost
i would really like to try try the oil balm.
as winter days is fast approaching im winterizing my skin as well
this is the best moisture i have ever used!
is not at all greasy
doesn't absorb right away
my skin starts to feel a little dry again
doesn't feel thick or heavy at all!
i think i could even top it with a light oil during the colder months for extra hydration because the air is quite dry where i live
i can't judge how well it works on wrinkles after just one packet
simply because i was rubbing the excess into my h
like a baby just took a shower kind of skin
have had a hard time finding a face wash that doesn't over dry my skin out
the fact that it doesn't lather means that it's not stripping my skins natural moisture
which is a bonus for those of us with drier skin
i hate going without washing my face now.
since i have very dry
it is not a cleanser i feel like i can't live without or am head over heels in love with
doesn't foam very much
have had a hard time finding a face wash that doesn't over dry my skin out
it gets too dry
doesn't strip or dry out my skin
since cleansers aren't on your skin for long before you wash them off
i don't feel it's necessary to spend nearly $40 on a specific morning cleanser
i keep it in the fridge to keep it extra cold
it gives me hydration without the excess oil that i usually get in the mornings
if i use any sort of skin care that isn't geared towards dry skin
cool on my skin i left on a little longer than 10 minutes because i was loving the effects
must have for dry skin !!
it literally feels like you have a bag of ice on your face the entire time
it doesn't dry all the way
my skin seems to really drink this product right up
i find it so soothing to leave my masks on for 30/40 minutes
my face does not feel tight at all as the gel dries
i didn't find this mask to sting or irritate it otherwise
it did sting my sensitive spot a little bit when i first applied it
it kinda feel like when you been on your water drinking game
if you are super dry like me i use the camu sleeping mask which is creamy
i usually use first aid beauty- because i am dry
i really enjoyed this mask i tend to have more dry skin
so there might be less of a tingle if you don't remove layers of dead skin immediately before using this
always make sure you wash your h
this mask retextures so much
you have to apply fast because it dries quickly.
utterly zap what little moisture i have
it's not drying at all.
you can put it on really thin so you get more out of the bottle than other br
not in a greasy way
not good for very dry skin like mine is in the winter
this does not make me oily or too dry
i find them to be a little drying even with weekly use
i need something to pull out all the junk in my pores
some can leave your skin feeling too dry or oily after
all you need is a very small amount of warm water
lotion-like feel which is good because my face is already oily
i do not get pilling
yet somehow manages to keep my face moisturized for the whole day
probably from all the moisture
typically use this after i shower or wash my face
i usually let it absorb into my skin for about 10 minutes before i try to put on makeup
this winter has been extra hard on my extremely dry
i mean extremely dry
have struggled with moisturizers that are too thick or make me too greasy
there is no sticky feeling after i put it on.
i no longer have dry flakes for the winter!
with the water being so harsh
the weather so dry i really needed something that would quench my skin thrist
sleep tight balm to help with that when i can afford them
t allows your base to easily cling to your skin without attaching to any dry patches or anything
it will be a good addition to your daily routine if you already have sunscreen in your foundation
not sticky but could be heavy in the summer.
maybe because of my age i use my makeup very sparingly
a little oily for me
i suggest you try it as a night cream if you don't like the feeling of it as a day moisturizer
must be people's make-up or dry skin if it does on others
it does meld into my skin or i wouldn't be able to apply silicone primer
this is absolutely the best one i've tried on my normal to dry skin
it doesn't leave my skin sticky
so my skin these days is beyond dry
it really does feel like it locks in moisture better than any other moisturizer i've used
it also doesn't burn like a lot of moisturizers do on my extra sensitive skin
might be too heavy if you don't have very dry skin
what i do after i wash my face is splash a little cold water
i just rub it off
i don't put it on before makeup cause if i did it kinda clumps up
granted i do not use foundation so for me this works well under loose powder
dewy3- skin brightes has increased 4- lips volume has increase yes i use them on the lips 5-it balances my combination skinover all i give it a 12 out of 10 the smell is not good
i wouldn't use it as a day cream though as it is thicker than your usual day cream
wait for it absorb before applying your make up
it does take awhile to soak in
didn't irritate or cause my skin to break out
this sinks right into the skin without making it feel greasy or oily
i struggle to find a moisturizer that doesn't make my skin oily or doesn't do the job
this is the only lotion i have used that soaks into the skin instead of sitting on top of it
t doesn't irritate my skin
i never used any western products on my skin because of the harsh chemicals
i like that because i feel as though it's providing a longlasting layer of moisture
my face was still sticky from it
this does a pretty good job of getting moisture into my skin rather quickly
this doesn't have a nasty scent to this like some moisturizers out there do
since my skin is very dry right now i do need something extra at night
i can see my tub lasting a long time.
the mud/dirt/oil/i don't even want to know what that is that i contend with i searched
this is saying a lot from someone who suffers from very dry skin
until my 30s has always been oily
i like to apply it with my origins renewal night cream sometimes
i did a ton of research on a product that would help with the redness around my nose that's always been there
i do recommend it to any one with dark or red spot
i also loved how light the serum was without making me feel or look oily by the end of the day
totally worth it if you are ready to get serious about treating your sun spots
i can easily use it under my moisturizer during the day without feeling like its sitting on top of my skin
this doesn't quite do the trick at cutting down on shine
it keeps my makeup from settling into fine lines which are even more noticeable once i get oily
i needed something with a bit more moisture than my juno oil was giving me
doesn't leave a residue or leave skin feeling oily or tacky in any way
my skin doesn't feel dry at all
actually squeaky clean after i use it
i like to use this when my skin has excessive oil
last longer than typical face washes
not dry or tight
i could tell that it was actually soaking into my skin as i washed
i normally don't spend that much on a bar of soap
it does not make your skin feel dry
the brush head helps it lather even more that it does on its own
there's never any make up left on the cotton pad
it doesn't irritate my skin at all or leave it feeling tight
i'd like to try the charcoal one in this line
even though i have oily
doesn't dry out my combo skin.
really only use it a little in the shower if i'm in a hurry
sweatiness from our gross humid weather
after washing it doesn't leave my skin dry or tight
it doesn't overdry or feel sticky.
would be good for people with oily skin.
it does make my face feel a bit dry after each use
i am not into bar soap because most are not good for your skin
i've never found a bar soap that doesn't completely dry out my face
not only does it not dry out my face
i like the idea of having a bar soap like this that does the job with ingredients which are good for the skin
i hate all the cheap fragrancy body washes out there
doesn't dry me out at all
i can say it made my skin drier
the soap wasn't so drying on my skin anymore
however i do like this soap since it helps with my breakouts
doesn't leave your skin feeling dry or like its sticking on you
this oil somehow need us the oiliness of my t-zone
it does absorb into the skin with some time
i just dab a little extra on it
depending on how dry your skin is
my t-zone is usually very oily
i am less oily
i like how this keeps my oily skin balanced all day
this oil does wonders for my skin.
not heavy on oily ones for those with combination skin
this is the oil for you
if i had some sugary food or dairy i would break out the next day
my skin has cleared up no matter what i eat!
the consistency of this oil is not too heavy
i tried almost every face oil out there: josie maran argan oil regular/light
it didn't make my skin worse
won't dry you out
because i still get oily throughout the day
i highly recommend if you have combination/oily skin
whatever the ingredients is inside this oil smells exactly like when you walk into a teavana store
i can see this working really well for people with drier skin
but i notice this one absorbs quickly too.
it gives just the right amount of moisture
this is the only moisturizer i have ever tried that hasn't left my skin feeling/looking oily midday
as if you have a slight chemical burn
i did notice that little bumps would pop up on parts of my face where i don't normally get acne
it does make your foundation slippery though.
when i wake up my face is pretty much matte instead of oily
this oil completely cleared up the flaky skin as well
let it soak in
but the lapis oil just really does it for me.
put oil on your face to keep your face from being oily
when they say it's oil balancing
my skin always tends to break out whenever the cold weather comes
'm thinking that for the warmer seasons i'll be using lapis
a must-have for anyone with breakout prone or oily skin
your skin needs it
noticed that my skin is less oily during the day
as someone with oily
i did not think facial oils were for me
i do not become oily throughout the day
it definitely helps balance out the oiliness without neglecting the dry areas
it's light enough that you can layer it under sunblock without feeling like an oil slick
doesn't make me greasy at all
so when i first picked this oil up i was a little worried it wouldn't be hydrating enough for me
it has made my already oily skin even more greasy with lots of breakouts
even though i've never liked the idea of putting oil on my oily skin
it would dry my skin out terribly
have always struggled to find a balance between moisturizing too much or too little
not oily in the slightest
this oil keeps me from being too oily
didn't absorb or left my skin dry
i kept reapplying thinking i forgot certain areas of my face until i realized that my skin was practically inhaling this stuff
not heavy or oily at all
finding a face oil that doesn't make me look like an oil slick right after i apply it is really hard
so my only caution would be to try to keep your bangs off your forehead as it absorbs
keeps me balanced where i'm oily
it actually balanced out my skin
the finish is so nice i'll even use it in the morning under my sunscreen
it hydrates the dry parts just right without causing my t-zone to get overly greasy
the problem with buying intensive hydration creams is that they almost always cause me to break out
you can always add a few more drops for a more dewy finish
before you use this oil
make sure it is fully dry before you do so-you'll feel like a rich housewife when using this oil btw-dark spots are gone
it makes your moisturizer last longer too when you mix the two together
i only use 3 drops after my night cream which is enough to do my face
i now purposely rub it into my cyticles
this oil manages to fix my issues with dryness while not making my skin oily
creams are full of things you should never put on your skin
it's really helping get rid of my awful dry flakey winter skin
i've found it applies a lot easier to damp skin
can't wait to try the lapis oil next!
i shy away from oils that aren't advertised for the oily among us
during the winter months i tend to develop dry spots of skin in r
not heavy or oily at all
this is a great oil for dry skin
because it takes a while for the oil to absorb into my skin
i live in a drier climate
i got this as my winter skin oil as i normally use clarins huile lotus to control my oily skin
it also doesn't cause breakouts nor is it greasy on my skin
the smell last only until the oil is absorbed
no oily film on your face.
it's so relaxing that i use it on my hands also.
it's works miracle for the dry patches on my skin
sometimes the skin around the end of my nose get so dry
it is the perfect amount of moisture without making my skin feel heavy or oily
it's also really great in the colder months when my skin dries out
the packaging is so beautiful that i it can be left out in your bathroom
i usually apply it mid day to hydrate my face
i make sure to use it before any events or special occasions because my skin glows
if followed as directed this mask will turn your skin from blah to radiant in a matter of a few days
definitely would recommend stirring the mask before using every time to get the best glowing skin
when it dries your face becomes quite tight
it may go on a little bit runny
if you spread it with clean fingers
i feel like the steam helps it not dry out.
they'd often leave me with itchy
you can make them as thin or thick of a mask as you want
my skin these days is dry
i do remember a slightly unpleasant feeling on the skin when i first used it
i do get the occasional spot
it didn't dry out my skin at all
i apply with a brush and let dry.
like i find myself touching my face all of the time because it's so soft
if you're not used to a slight tingle
try not to put my skin through too much
this is just enough that it still helps smooth my skin without making it too dry or sensitive
i didn't find that it burned or tingled either.
have to be careful not to spill this liquid gold
it has never irritated or dried out my skin
would also not make my oily combination skin act up
don't find it over drying as long as i use a face oil
just remember a little goes a long way cause it asks for a "thin" layer that stays on for 15-20 min
especially if it's already irritated from washing off my makeup
pros:-your skin feels as soft as a baby's whenever you use this mask-a little goes a long way -does a great job of decongestant skin
you really only need a very thin layer
i really didnt know what to think a scrub with blue tanzanite in it would be like
i've never used a chemical face make before
the only thing to help it is the warm weather
you can really feel the cleaning effect it has!
little bit difficult to rinse off though.
i let it dry completely
it's a bit hard to wash off after it dries out
i found that repeated usage doesn't irritate my skin at all
it is a little difficult to wash off
the only downside is how long it takes to rinse off
it doesn't linger on the skin
because they are so wet
it did not irritate or break my sensitive skin out
i don't have oily skin
after you wash it off
everything made my skin worse
om blemishes all over that just don't give me an even complexion
i can't say enough about how amazing the blue tansy mask is
it barely takes any to adequately coat your face
lots of products don't work right with my skin
be sure to check that yours has the spatula
this is one of the few products that is strong enough to clean out my pores
the smell isn't too bad when you apply it on your face
take it off with a warm wash cloth like the instructions say
i think my dark spots may be getting lighter too
i didn't experience any burning or eye watering.
i usually neglect buying eye creams because they make my eyes sting so bad
when i apply at night i just don't dab it in as much
how it looks on our bathroom shelf
the jar lasts me a long time.
it also gives me just the right amount of moisture
if you use too much i've noticed that it kind of sits on top of your skin
love how it feels cold when i put it on.
i do think it helps a bit with undereye darkness as well
i tend to get very dry under my eyes
i also only use eye cream at night since i sometimes have oily skin
it can be a bit thick
finding a good eye cream for me was very hard since i did not want anti-aging or any cream that was harsh on my skin
i didn't even see a point in using eye cream
that it didn't irritate my eyes or skin
end up making my whole face greasy
not too greasy or think
if you put it on your lids
it can feel quite sticky
because the winter had made my under eyes so dry
doesn't leave the skin feeling super tight like other products do
my eyes water at the slightest thing-even the clinique eye creams couldn't get too close to my lash line
i can't wait to go a few weeks using the eye dew
i literally feel my skin soak it up.
definitely a 4 out of 5 in terms of nourishing my dry eye area
i don't feel greasy in the eye area
sometimes dont even have to put moisturizer on afterward
at first it didn't seem to sink into my skin
as you heat this up while putting it on
i can easily get a few drops from the dropper whereas others have said it dispenses the entire tube
it does have a licorice smell so that may be a turn-off for some people
though not rich enough for real winter cold
i usually have to use plain raw shea as everything else causes breakouts or flaking
i like to use this more heavily at night to nourish my skin
i am curious if that quality will continue in warmer weather
after you put your other products on it doesn't smell as bad
this has been a skin saver after suffering through the yucky winter
don't forget sun protection on top!
one pump is enough to cover your face.
it will change your skin
can sometimes burn the skin
because their product was not air tight
the only thing i dislike about these types of serums is the "boiled hot dog" smell that lingers on the skin throughout the day
if i use more than a "pump" plus a drop it burns.
i let this dry
then let that dry
your skin has to get used to it
it does not bother my 41 year dry sensitive skin
just pay attention to how your serum looks
i find it almost like a dry oil
i don't really have a place for it in my routine since i'm already using a facial oil as a serum
it's packed with all the ingredients that you would want in a serum
doesn't remain tacky like other serums can
especially if i sweat
due my hair touching my face or other irritating things coming in contact with it
just make sure you watch out for oxidation
100% recommend for people with dry skin
not in a greasy or oily way
i tend to be on the dry side
not greasy or dry anywhere
if you wash your h
i don't mean the my skin is so oily it could be glowing glow
i wore this under my mattifying moisturizer because i can see how it could make my skin oily if i didn't
nothing like hot dogs as some say
's products are making my skin break out
which tends to stick with you on your face
it is also a bit sticky on its own
that doesn't tend to bother me since i usually layer it under other products
this can make you look shiny or make your skin feel sticky
in couple sec my skin soaked it like was so thirsty
did not leave any sticky texture
doesn't leave my skin shiny or greasy
i can't get over the smell of this moisturizer- it smells so good i just want to keep putting it on my face over
quick-absorbing hydration was perfect under my foundation when i was trying to do a quick makeup application
in my late 20's my skin has gotten a little less oily i still tend to find that a lot of creams
i do not like sticking my fingers in a tub.
ever since using this it is no longer flaky just a smooth surface
even out my skin
i find that i have to layer on a thicker cream on top of the gel because my face still feels a bit tight
my skin thanks me for you using it.
gives it the perfect balance -not oily or too dry-
it doesn't leave my skin oily.
doesn't leave any sort of residue behind
it does dry out the skin a bit after
you have to rigorously shake it to get a nice foam out
i struggle to find a cleanser that doesn't dry it out or irritate it
the product did not strip away moisture
didn't break out my sensitive skin
don't like any of them i realized i should just buy more egg mousse soap
it doesn't irritate my skin at all!
it also does not at all dry out my super dry skin it moisturizes it nicely
that's how my skin feels after i wash it off simply amazing
t's hard to find a product that doesn't irritate my skin
it did dry out my skin a little
all in all for my skin i feel like i still have yet to find the perfect facewash
which i always remove with micellar water anyway
not dry at all
leav skin clean and not to dry.
you will get more than your money's worth out of this cleanser
when you wash it off
you won't feel any film or residue on your face
it does give me a deep cleanse
when you pump the product onto your h
makes me giggle each time i use it because the foamy texture is so fun to start the day off
it doesn't dry out my skin that much
does not dry out my skin
it just washes the day away without leaving my face dry
it doesn't leave my skin with that tight-dry sensation
it drys clear really fast without water.
at this point, my skin is normal/dry.
/or sunscreen you need something oil based to take that stuff off
foam use to be my favorite thing
the only issue i have with it is that because you're supposed to apply this to your face before rinsing with water
it can get really dry
a little difficult to rub around upon application
it makes your skin to breath after using it
makes it a little hard to put on without getting in your hair
the foam is really fun to put on your face
it doesn't make my skin red
i struggled for so long especially in the winter to find a gentle non-drying face wash
washing your face at the end of the night can sometimes be a boring task
it keeps your face at bay if you have relatively good skin
does not dry out my skin
as someone with normal to dry skin that is not a bad thing
does not dry out my skin
i also love the way my skin feels when i wash it off
the oily portion being my t zone.
because of it the consistency it didn't provide enough lather
i usually use about the size of a cotton ball maybe a smidgen more
it does not dry out or feel harsh on my dry skin
it is a bit strange at first because it does feel like you're putting shaving cream on your face
not too dry or slick
their egg mask is wonderful too!
the trick to using this mask is to make sure you fully massage the product into your skin to where the mousse has vanished into a clear
this mousse pack is a great way to meet that need
it is easy to wash off.
one of my major pet peeves with face packs is how difficult they can be to rinse away
it's not sticky feeling like a foam
something that comes out as a thick foam couldn't possibly do good things for my skin
i assumed it would be drying
i apply a little water when removing it
use it sort of like a face wash
especially in winter when my skin gets super dry
dry skin so when i tried this product i was a bit worried
it did not over dry
leaving me looking a bit like a picasso or a salvatore dali melted face
it is a thicker serum but not heavy at all.
not only does it smooth fine lines
they never burn or get milia
i remembered that the bottle says you can use this on the lips
most everything else didn't even touch the puffiness
often get little breakouts or bumps if i am sensitive to it
i don't have to use another eye cream
no need to have my chemical peel done
if you massage it in for a couple of minutes it doesn't stay noticeably sticky
a bottle lasts me a long time because i only use it as a spot treatment on any dark spots on my face
i used it as a spot lightener too
feels tacky for a while after you rub it on your face
i am not in the sun which makes the spots shine through everything
if you expose your skin to the sun those spots will return
if you are expecting your skin to do a 180 then turn your attention to laser treatments
is slightly drying so follow up with a moisturizer other thank that i love it
i take good care of my skin
shouldn't use it all over the skin
before using this product my skin seemed darked on my chin for some reason too
can be damaging to your skin
skin treatments shouldn't be judged on how pretty they smell
make sure you use sun screen though because it does make your skin sensitive
as long as you wash your h
i feel that it has really decreased the sun spots on my face from tanning
i would caution you to pay attention to your body if after a few days your skin is too dry or irritated stop for a few days
you don't want to overly dry out your skin.
this serum helped lighten almost all of them
although my blemishes would go away rather quickly
this is what j use to clean off my make go along with micellar water
i feel like this is one of the only one cleansers that really made a difference on my skin
it doesn't make my skin feel dry
s down the best face wash for my dry
this doesn't dry my skin out, but cleans so well.
it does have mild grit to it
just enough to sluff off dead skin.
some people have commented that this dries their skin out
doesn't dry my skin at all.
without drying my skin out too much
i love to use this around the winter time when my skin gets dry
good deep cleansing exfoliator really gets below the skin to help clear it out
even without being irritated from the harsh chemicals
doesn't dry out skin
you should never use a face wash that has beads or granules in it with one of those
cannot wait to try more face washes
doesn't dry my face out
so now i have to be even more vigilant with sunscreen because i can get a little pinky with just a couple minutes of sun on short err
doesn't dry out my skin
oils i couldn't get it right
it does everything for my skin to prepare it for moisture
i no longer have the dry uneven texture!
it does foam up slightly if you rub it
it doesn't irritate my skin either
the ingredients help give my large pores a deeper clean so they are less noticeable
gentle enough to use every day
it left my skin super smooth but not dried out.
i love the combination of acids in this as well i feel like it really cleans deep down
also this did not irritate or dry out my skin or leave a tight feeling on my face after using it which is always a huge bonus
i suppose it was just polishing away the bad layers
the eyes are a part of your face so wouldn't it make sense for a cleanser to be safe with the eyes?
t has more time to sink in to my skin
i would never rub hard or use with any kind of abrasive pad or even a clarisonic
my skin doesn't get irritated at all
the only downside is that it can be drying
before this product i always felt like there was never enough lotion on the planet to quench my face
moisturizing agents can't go through if there is a layer of dead skin on your face
i still need to use a very good facial oil after
if you gave oily/combination/dry skin that you know how to h
gentle enough to use everyday
which can dry out your skin
'm looking to dry it out a
as i age it was drying my skin out far too much
doesn't dry it out or irritate it
every few days i'll use this with my clarisonic to really work it into my pores
stripped my skin of too much oil
is gentle enough where i use a little around my eye area to clean off make up
this works well as it doesn't irritate my skin
it does not make me feel like i am scrubbing the skin off of my face
too drying for my skin to use daily as some folks suggested
i still have oily areas on my face as well
it doesn't irritate my skin at all
it is not drying
doesn't dry my skin.
can never find a face wash that helps
look so glowy so for now i'll stick to this
the aha/bha in it makes it possible to rid of those little bumps on your arms
: after massaging into my face i leave it for maybe 30 seconds or a minute before rinsing it off with warm water
it can be slightly drying though
this is coming from someone with oily skin
because it can dry out my skin
my skin looks so much better since beginning to use this to cleanse my skin
doesn't dry out your skin
avoid your eyes until you're done with your face so that your eye make-up doesn't get rubbed everywhere else on your skin
it does not irritate my skin
it doesn't dry out your skin
doesn't dry out as quickly
you don't have to scrub
not dry or greasy
i know numbers of people use cleansing oil to remove make up in a whole
doesn't leave a heavy film or residue
not because i feel i have to wash off remaining oil
then put a little water on your h
so the small amount of mascara left over was never a problem
apply it to a dry face
more often then not i just want to peal my lashes off
feels great when i massage it onto my combination
i will put this on my completely dry face
then get in the shower to rinse it off with only water
that's not to say that you still shouldn't cleanse your face because you literally just used an or oil on it to remove makeup
i apply this oil on a dry face
this product does not irritate my skin
i love the fact that the bottle is good to go for traveling without leaking on everything in your bag
normally when you think "oily face" you don't think "add oil"
it didn't burn my eyes.
although i still followed up with the foam because i like to be sure there's no residue/oil left
does not irritate my eyes or my contacts
t doesn't break out sensitive skin
when my skin gets too dry
doesn't feel dry after wash!
i find that while it breaks up makeup when i just use my h
it doesn't all come off my face unless i'm using the cotton
no need to use a facecloth
this takes everything off without ever leaving any residue
we tried to see how much this cleansing oil took off of my mothers thick makeup by using a toner after ward
this also doesn't irritate my eyes like other oils
it's not drying which i was hoping for.
doesn't leave any residue
it doesn't dry my skin out
for those new to oil cleansers please remember that it takes skin a long time to switch from one routine to another
oil cleansing may break you out at first
you put it on dry
my skin has never felt so clean as it does after i use this on the shiseido cotton page
might leave your skin just a tad on the dry side after cleansing with it
she suggested trying this out since it's no rinse
there is no need to rinse or towel dry
doesn't't make it tight & dry.
it really picks up extra dirt that doesn't get cleaned with my cleanser
there is no drying even though this is a water-based product
leaves a bit more of a residue than i would like
also this doesn't leave my skin tight
then apply the foam while your skin is still dry
having to dry my face mid shower in order to then use this product is slightly annoying
what product can actually reverse oily skin
it does an amazing job of breaking down daily grime
it has not dried my skin out
didn't dry me out
it hasn't dried my skin out when used with drunk elephant marula oil which works amazing for my acne all over my forehead
just make sure you use a moisturizer afterwards as it will dry you out
make my skin get better
i don't have as much blemishes as before.
i already have dry skin
cant use anything specifically made for acne because it drys my skin out way more
this does not dry out my forehead
it can be drying
s aren't putting too much oil on my skin
if it's too drying
just avoid double cleansing because it will dry you out
when i do get a problem area it never surfaces to a real pimple
never leaves it dry
it doesn't irritate my skin at all
it won't dry your skin out either
is that it does make your skin dry if you've been using it for a while
i hate when some cleansers make my skin feel like a desert afterwards
it feels heavenly when you're applying it on your face
it does not dry out the skin whatsoever
i loveeee the cooling sensation you get when you wash it off
i could imaging this may be a little harsh on dry skin though because i have oily skin
it did dry out my chin a bit
do not use it more than once a day or else you risk drying out your skin thereby creating more breakouts
my face does not have the texture
i would highly recommend this to anyone who has oily skin
it doesn't dry me out or leave my skin irritated
it doesn't dry out my skin or feel me leaving tight or itchy
if you're prone to dry skin
all it did was dry me out
i can go on my way to brightening skin care to rid me of dark spots
it works but it dried out my face so bad.
it is not drying and that is a plus.
i highly recommend to anyone with acne or just a face wash that makes the face feel clean
i absolutely love this cleanser for my acne-prone skin i feel like it does a great job of cleaning my skin without making it feel stripped
luckily after years of searching for the right cleanser this seems t do the trick
it also does not dry out my skin.
this can be drying
would definitely recommend to those with oily
drying out is not an issue.
this does dry your skin out
if you tend to have more dry skin i probably wouldn't try this because it is a little drying or maybe just use a couple times a week
i even have dry skin
i will say though if you have dry skin it will really dry you out
f you have normal or oily skin this should be fine for you
be careful if you have dry skin
you do have to be careful of over usage as it is a little drying however with my oily skin it is needed
i do not feel my face getting oily throughout the day
is much too harsh to use for every wash
not skin deep so as for clearing up my skin like any product i have tried it does not clear my skin
it is drying- so be prepared for that.
i tried a few things which either didn't work or badly burned my sensitive skin
it can also be a bit drying
having lived with combo-oily skin for so long
now to have combo-dry skin
this product doesn't really strip my skin dry
i just like the fact that it eliminates bacteria that can cause acne that's my main reason for usage
it doesn't dry my face out too much.
it is not drying at all
it does dry up my skin
that said, it dried my skin out very badly.
because murad's products are so highly concentrated o recommend using this product 3-4 times a week if you find it's too drying
i wouldn't recommend this for anyone with dry/combination skin because it's very drying
it can dry you out a little if you have sensitive skin
you'll be right as rain
not enough to dry the skin out
it doesn't make my skin more red which is an issue for me as well
so for dry/normal/combo skin i wouldn't recommend this product
usually in the winter my skin gets dried out easy
my skin dries out very easily even though it is greasy
some people are saying it dried their skin out
didn't dry my face out
you can't rub this product in at all or it will peel on you face
i noticed to that it pills unless you put it on when your other treatments have dried completely
then wait for this to dry.
my skin sucks it up right away
rub it in very well
occassionally it would still do that balling up thing under my makeup
i notice that it dries more quickly that way
my skin can look dry
i apply it to my dry make-up covered face
i let it air dry for the most part
you would think a balm wouldn't be good for oily skin
it didn't strip my skin of it's natural oils yet removed all the make up
especially when my skin is feeling a bit more on the dryer side
nurish like no other balm does
this does not irritate my skin
my towels are permanently grey in some places from this intense kevyn aucoin mascara i use
seriously buy this is you have remotely dry skin
this is my night time cleanser due to the fact that it has some grit to it to help exfoliate anything i have on my face from the day
it is not too drying or too oily for my combination skin
it is rare for a balm of any kind to anything on my combination skin without giving me blemishes
didn't feel like it did much after i washed it off
leave me with dry patches
it does have little sugar crystal chunks in it which some might find weird for a balm or might not work well for super sensitive skin
gets all the gunk off of your face while not stripping it completely
when i use my other cleansers there is always a little bit of residue left when i go over my face with a cotton pad
it's a little treat for removing full face make up or heavy foundation whenever i need to feel like a princess lol
if you put it on your eyes your eyes will have an oily film on them which is a big drawback for me since i hate that feeling
they are a nice little massaging bonus
i don't seem to get the foamy milky reaction other comments say
i still like to rub in again with warm water
used cold water afterwards
found that if you rinse with a little bit of cold water after there isn't a lot of that greasy oily feeling leftover
if you didn't like that feeling try the cold water
for reference i have normal skin with some dry patches
get a bit oily throughout the day also breakout very easily
won't bother your eyes too much if you're looking to use this balm as your "one cleanser for all areas of the face
when you're done cleansing your face
it's not a bad kind of "oiled"--i'd say it's moisturized with whatever ingredients are in the balm
more dry in the winter
a lot of products can seem to irritate it
i apply a little to dry skin
once you rinse it off your face will feel like
i highly recommend this for anyone with dry winter skin
i looked into this stuff after hearing a lot about the clinique take the day of cleansing balm
i think it is a good cleanser in the winter when the weather is dry
you're probably not massaging firmly enough
no need to worry about keeping my cleansing oil in my checked bag or decanting into a smaller bottle
how oily it felt
it doesn't feel oily to me at all
the "grit" i see mentioned in other reviews isn't harsh on my skin
then is left with dry skin
it is amazing if your skin gets really dry in winter months
then add really warm water
not always} i use a toner there is nothing on the cotton pad
dry skin at all
it seems like a scrub when you first put it on your face
i can see how some people might be turned off by the slightly waxy
it will semi-hold that consistency until you add warm water
i love this so much more than salt based-scrubs because it's much gentler
especially with the irritating dryness i tend to get around my lips
you feel like you've had a facial just by washing your face
is able to hold moisture <3 this
although i don't use it as a wash lol i have a smaller jar of this
i start with dry skin
it does not burn or irritate your eyes at all.
then once you are done you rinse it off.
the sales person told me to use it on a completely dry face
i actually find it works better to use it with wet fingers
however i'll definitely be using up the rest of the tub
my skin is dry in the winter
love that it leaves a dewy finish that doesn't irritate my skin either
i believe that the little three ounce tub is too expensive
the texture of the balm is hard so when i first crack this baby open
i find that the balm takes off almost all my make up
often get dry patches
this not only helps to get rid my dry patches
i would not recommend this product as a makeup remover because it does burn when you get it near your eyes
wouldn't have to carry this big jar in my makeup bag on planes
it is very firm so until you break through the surface it's a bit hard to work with
otherwise you'll have a residue
this balm doesn't have as greasy/thin consistency like other ones i have tried
while i'm not as in love with the texture of this one
this balm doesn't do that
it was not slippery/oily enough
you have to use some cotton or a wipe to help it
night as i realized all regular cleansers were drying my skin out like crazy during these winter months
it really does clean your skin
it even took care of my mascara without having me look like a raccoon
my face can be dry
or can be extremely oily
not oily at all!
run a cloth under really hot water
it's also a nice thick balm so when you massage it into your face
it does a good job gently picking up any bits of dry skin
it helps tighten your face not a treatment!
i find it gives a lot of moisture
i just didn’t notice them on my skin
i generally have very oily
this stuff burns my eyes if it gets anywhere near them
no because it burns my eyes maybe if they made it without the spf
not oily or greasy at all.
i love that it has spf in it as well since it's hard to find it a good moisturizer that doesn't clog your pores
i do not feel like i am applying a heavy sunscreen to my face that just sits on the surface of my skin
the ones i've tried always seem to have that "greasy" smell no matter how much fragrance they put in it
this cleanser gets rid of any buildup on the skin without drying me out
only down fall is i did not like the sponge.
i leave it on my face for a minute or so to let it melt
do its thing before i sponge it off
a splurge that is probably best for combo to drier skin types
it feels oily going on your dry skin
if i take a shower
left my skin prone to breakouts especially because i'm a big fan of using oils at night
my skin gets superrrr dry in the winter
best for: anyone with dry skin
take care of you skin without harsh chemicals!
you literally need only a dab of the product to cover the entire face area
or if you have sensitive skin
very oily in the oily spots as well
give it 2 weeks to balance your skin.
not dried out - but not greasy.
apply it to your skin
i don't care too much for the scent though.
those with normal/dry skin will enjoy it
if you use a toner after cleansing than the above doesn't matter
does not dry my skin out like other cleansers have in the past
i do not use the sponge with it
all my dry spots feel normal
not like an oil
i read one review that said she leaves it on for a little bit before washing off
there is so much product in the jar
i like the sponge but i prefer with the foreo!
dry to very dry skin in the fall
always wash my face twice
moisturizing that i felt like the real benefits were being washed away after i cleansed a second time with my clarisonic
the sponge is nice if you have dry paclesn
i found it helped my neuroliquid serum absorb in my skin better too
it didn't dry up so fast
however i did notice that this tends to dry a lot faster
for those who are conplaining that it dries too fast
do not worry about thinning out the profuct too much
i don’t have to apply too much of the gel
i hate having to apply the gel with my fingers it's a mess
with this you just brush it on
easier to wipe or wash off if you want to
this oil ranks #1 in a tie w nude for me because it is highly moisturizing without being greasy
it is ideal for winter months when your face gets super dry
then when you add water
is not overly drying
even looking afterwards which speaks volumes as i have yet to find an hg cleanser that does not irritate my rosacea
it did burn a little in my eyes
when you put it on your dry skin
your skin won't feel tight afterwards either.
super oily in certain places
i now keep it in the fridge
i tend to stay away from overnight heavy duty hydrating products because they make my skin oily
you need to be careful to not apply it around your eyes as it stings a bit
they leave my skin feeling too sticky/oily
the humidity of summer in new york leaves my normal skin really dry
it doesn't necessarily make your pores look smaller or get rid of the bags under your eyes
it did a lot to help quench the dry skin around my mouth
what i love the most is it doesnt make your skin greasy at all
using this nightly mask twice a week has added just the right amount of moisture back to my skin
after trying the hydra therapy sleep mask for a week my face is noticeably softer without getting oily either
i hate going to sleep with an oily face
was unsure how it would stay on or not stain my bedding
i may even prefer it to the sheet mask
which tend to dry out my skin
this is great because it doesn't irritate my skin or feel heavy on my face or goopy as a lot of other moisturizers tend to feel
not greasy at the same time
was worried that there would be some residue on my pillow
absorbs quickly -- there is no sticky or wet feeling
doesn’t cause a breakout because it is not heavy/oily
