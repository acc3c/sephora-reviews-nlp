the product itself is good
this felt nice going on
this is nice and all but really expensive!
while it does feel nice
it felt much better
maybe this is nice for people with extremely dry skin
this cream felt great
seeing how it works for your skin type
i feel like this beauty oil will be the exception because it feels so luxurious
it really did a great job depuffed my eyes
it was just okay
i would say this is one for the fun factor
my skin does feel nice after using it
there isn't really much firming to be done
felt exactly the same
it looks awesome on
it definitely doesn't feel firming to me
my skin feels great
its a cool concept makes my skin feel good
not sure about the tightning aspect
this mask is a ton of fun
it was real exciting while it lasted
is really bad for skin
this product is what brought me to glamglow.
it feels like you're doing something really nice for yourself
it has done nothing for me
it felt like it helped
it puts out the perfect amount of product for my entire face
it just doesn't feel good on my skin.
using it isn't a great experience.
it felt incredible on
this was a big miss for me
however, for me it isn't a perfect fit.
this product seems to be too much
this product felt great on my skin
this is far too expensive of a product to have done absolutely nothing for my skin
this product is nice.
hope everyone else has better luck with it than me
showing me how wonderful it made my skin appear
a little product comes out
i learned early on that a little bit goes on a long way
besides all the positives things about it
does absolutely nothing for dark circles
this seems to make my situation worse
it does absorb very nicely though
definitely not worth 100 points in my opinion.
and that isn't a good outcome for the eyes is it?
a big issue for me is that it stings my eye-area every time i put it on
also the packaging is absolutely horrible
it has done nothing for me
the all about eyes is much better.
other than that the serum itself feels nice
it was like a terrible mask.
this one is definitely not worth it
this made my skin look awful!
when you put this product on it feels good against the skin
with good spf maybe this is for you
this stuff is horrible
it feels like it sort of sits on my face
it is not pleasant
it does have a slight tingling sensation so hopefully that means it's working
this product is terrible and a waste of money.
it definitely does what it says
this is a big no-no for me
it got a bit flaky i know it does get some excellent review
so maybe that is what it is good at.
but overall, it seems to be a good product.
it felt great going on
my skin was clearly not happy with it
it was nothing special
this cream feels very nice when you touch it
it feels very heavy
genius line work great
gave it a good try but it is a terrible product.
i think this product was a good one.
this product has done absolutely nothing
the product itself was a very odd consistency.
so there it sits.
hopefully this will be a keeper
luckily i put very little this time
this happens to me quite often
it did as great job at calming down my breakout
make an amazing difference
the worst thing of all
especially with the great reviews
but it was nothing truly special.
how it makes my face look
really it was just this
it felt good when i applied it.
it feels very intense
even with a small amount it just doesn't feel nice
feels amazing when applying the product
hopefully it works for others!
by itself it doesn't feel like it really sinks in
a little product goes a long way
it works very well.
this mask was very tricky
it felt so incredibly good on my face.
this was super disappointing.
this is the second murad products that's done this
the product itself is good.
while the product is fabulous for my skin
it has done nothing to my skin
it seems to be a nice face mask.
it felt great going on
the one star is for the aesthetically pleasing element of the product: it looks pretty cool on your top shelf
the product itself is great
yet it hasnt done good for my skin whatsoever
i used the whole thing
it felt good putting it on
the product was amazing
really likes the natural
nice, but nothing life changing.
it has a nice feeling
feels nice going on
this stuff was nothing special
thought the benefits sounded great
it goes on flawlessly
which is really strange
it made me breakout
actually feels more like vaseline…
the oil itself is so great
this is a nice oil
which was very surprising
i gave this two stars because the product itself is good
it worked really well
not just an ordinary breakout
my first issue is how gigantic this
it does feel nice
which is really the best way to use it
it was a great idea, but not a superior product.
i like the way it goes on
it is what it says- a nice face oil.
the only good thing about this product was the packaging
so, yes, it goes on nice and cool.
really just feels pointless at the end of the day
it really does feel cooling
it was a neat item in my play!
it felt really nice
it feels so good going on
the first time i used it it felt so cool
aesthetics is the biggest thing going for this product
it does feel cool
it doesn't really cool me off very well
felt nice for a second
while it does feel nice upon application
it also has an odd
feels nice when it's first applied
this product feels nice when you first swipe it on
it is a bit too much for me
even though this cream was nice
this is definitely not it
this was terrible for me.
how nice it felt on my skin
as that has worked great with my skin
the consistency was nice
this product sort of sits on top of my skin
this is really heavy
feel that i really gave this a fair shot
this may be wonderful
get the same aspect
while it it fun
sephora play box has been quite disappointing thus far
it has done absolutely nothing
"smells amazing" is how i've seen it described in almost every shop that i found it
not nice at all.
on the plus side this product feels nice on the skin
this stuff is just terrible
the stuff feels like it never ever comes off
it felt pretty good while i was using it
i found it was pretty average,nothing special.
it did clean fairly well
when i brought this face wash i had very high hopes mostly since everyone was raving about how great it was
the best thing was the fragrance: lovely.
unfortunately for me this was not my experience.
was excited to for this new one
this new skin care line is doing nothing for my skin
still breaking out, so sad!
i gave this 2 stars because i do love the texture- a little goes a long way
that is not a good thing
it just wasn't very good
definitely not doing much for anti-aging.
it had a great consistency
i think this is a really good product
this product looked so pretty
i used the whole thing
it has lots of great reviews.
my skin looks pretty much the same after using a whole bottle
this is an interesting product
it is a good concept treat and smooth out.
well it comes in 2 steps
honestly step 2 is horrible it makes wrinkles look worse
good luck to who ever uses this
it is very nice
it does absorb really really really fast though
definitely not good for my skin
$47 is too much for something that is "okay"
this product feels nice
this stuff is pretty expensive for the small amount you get
it does a good job as a primer
i've definitely felt like it's helped my make up last longer
it has done nothing for my skin
at first it was great.
super disappointed, hopefully works for others.
feels amazing going on
i think this would be a great moisturizer for the right skin type as it does feel really great
and it was not the best idea.
if it works it works
for the right skin type this would be awesome
sadly it has done nothing
tugs on it a bit which we all know is a big no-no
it was a good experience
that is just personal to me
the biggest disappointment for me is how much it stings my eyes
it definitely keeps my skin nice
it was way too much product
in my dry/normal spots - it is awesome.
it is a little too much
so far no luck.
it feels great under my eyes
a little goes a long way
it was way too much
so because of that unfortunate quality
this is not such a great product.
the only thing nice about this gel is that it's good to apply before make up
glamgrow is a much better choice
it seems like small
it was a little hard to take--sweet
really makes a difference in my skin
found it works much better
my skin feels great
felt like nothing happened
'm not putting this mask in the spotlight particularly
like i said causes me to breakout :'
it looks really nice at a distance.
the rest of this line is so amazing at achieving a natural glow
a little goes a long way
perfect for a fair skinned person who is trying to achieve more of a natural highlight
this stuff is pretty neat
the whole "highlighter" thing was just an added bonus to me
it made me breakout
the product is beautiful as a highlight
takes away from any chance of looking like a natural beauty
it looks great and not greasy.
it goes on nicely
the origins ginzing works better than this for me
a little goes a long way
this product feels very nice on the skin
not in a good way
sadly this made me breakout
for me, it was a 1/5.
was too strong for me to use
the only good thing i like about it is that it's pretty good for sensitive skin
doesn't feel like it absorbs well
the fresh line seemed to be a nice choice
it has done nothing
so that was disappointing
initially it feels great
this product feels and behaves like a primer.
feels nice under make up
plus: - great for combination skin like mine
it feels like a very un needed product in my opinion
it just feels very very sticky
it is nice to apply
this is very disappointing
it feels nice on my skin
this is too overpowering for me
this kind of thing has never happened
nothing spectacular stands out about it.
the change wasn't good for me
pros: lightweight, a little goes a long way
the new formula is not good.
this is really a miss for me
purchased the renewed hope in a jar so far it is fantastic
i love it the texture is thicker the previous version my skin feels great looks great if this does not work for you try the renewed hope in a jar
it works great for him
it just isn't working out for me
the concept is really neat
the packaging is great because you only touch the amount of product that ends up going on your face
it doesn't feel that great
does not clean very well
it is such a great idea using both way of cleansing
it is really subtle
this goes on so smooth
felt great going on
it gets everywhere and becomes messy real quick.
it will feel good right at first
also it lasts me awhile.
this was very strong for me
which was not good
this one is not so great
it feels smooth going on
it felt like an unnecessary step
i really like the way it made my skin feel
the fragrance is so strong especially for something you put on your face
that is probably my favorite part
the good thing is
it worked pretty well
which is great for under foundation
it does absorb very nicely though.
the ingredients aren't impressive as far as long term improvement for us older ladies
the only reason why it's not a one star is because it has pretty good ingredients
this is obviously a problem
the pump is horrible.
the product itself does the job.
that works really well
it goes on easy and lasts all day.
great deal for what you get.
nice basic kit but not amazing
it worked fine though
feels great on my skin
definitely not a miracle product for me.
this is a great product, very good ingredients.
the formula itself felt okay
in the morning my skin does look nice also
of course everyone's skin is different
this did absolutely nothing good for my skin.
made my foundation look horrible
i like how the product feels
it has not done anything great for my skin
it was just okay
the consistency feels like primer- it seems to sit on top of my skin
the description of this makes it sound so wonderful
very thick, not very good for daily use
i gave this product a decent amount of work
i feel like it helps
just hasn't worked for me.
for all the good it does
giving this an extra star because it did feel very good on the skin
it feels great on your skin
it feels like it's working
this doesn't work well
it feels really cooling when you first put it on which i like
the package is nice
it actually feels very similar to my smashbox primer
but it feels nice on the skin, very light.
i can see it working very nice as a primer
the reason i am rating this only a few stars is because it is a horrible moisturizer
weird consistency and does absolutely nothing
only nice thing is that it feels cooling
jart generally has decent stuff
so far nothing has worked
this is a big no
consistently makes me break out
it feels good when you first put it on
it feels good under the eyes, though.
pro's: •absorbs fast •no irritation •it does a good job with fine lines
the essence is nice
it has a very strong
the pro consultant doing my makeover said this would be amazing
told me all the great benefits this has fit my skin
my make up comes off so easy now.
this one is just an ok
it feels very good when first applying on
feels great on the skin
the pump is a little hard to control.
this product is okay.
while this one feels good going on
this product was nice
this is definitely going back.
unfortunately it seems you need to use a fair bit for it to work
i like it because it feels refreshing
i only gave it two stars because it has a nice consistency
it has a cooling feeling which is kinda nice.
it feels nice to apply it
what the product is essentially doing
i love the way it makes my skin feels
amazing at first but not worth it
i think this would be a great bar for a truly oily-all-over skin type
had decent expectations for this
except my foundation always wears off really fast
the rest of the tsubaki line is great though.
possibly good for someone who wears foundation over it
this product was just "okay."
definitely a return for me.
just a big waste of money!
the overall product is great
one little bead of this stuff gets my entire face
so this lasts a super long time making the price not so bad
this product is fun to use.
not in a pleasant way
this made my foundations that normally look amazing already
it is not as awesome as people say
the consistency is weird
very good at what it claims
takes a bit of getting used to
i think she actually uses very little foundation because her skin is already perfect
it really doesn't work for me as a primer for foundation
the product is definitely in fact very sticky
okay i'm obviously in the minority here
it always looked bad
it has not worked for me as a primer
sadly, it is going back!
it worked nice for my dry spots
so overall, i give this a 3 stars.
this is really a side note
the product is a lot of fun to put on
it feels like glue going on
for me it was not a game changer.
its wonderful as a face primer.
no magic moment here.
i like the way it feels going on
it was so terrible on my skin type
not amazing as its sounds
doesn't work so well in real life
both misses from a great brand.
at first it looks great
i needed it to work really badly
like using the product because it helps me get a nice finish without using too much foundation
it was a great idea
this seemed like it was going to be a fantastic product
first time was amazing
my eyes it feels great
definitely not what i'm going for in an eye cream
it works great on my husb
which made me think it was doing something
the fact that it is a 2016 best of beauty winner
in my opinion just as good
because otherwise it is a nice product
the way it felt
it feels great when it's applied
however, this was a big miss for me.
at first it felt amazing
this is definitely not a good choice for me
the packaging is awesome
if that makes sense
i think this product is good
was expecting it to be amazing
it is very rich
this was nothing special
what a colossal waste of time.
over all it is a great product
each work together so nicely
it is a nice consistency
it made me breakout
it really doesn't work as a primer at all
it was fine, but not a game changer.
it was good, but not for me.
it made my foundation go on weird too.
i am as fair as the very fair model in the video here
it makes your skin look fantastic
it seemed like it was more for looks.
it's just not that amazing overall for my skin
that is a fantastic product.
there was nothing special about it
was excited to try it because of all the hype that surrounds this br
no matter how nice the product looked on my skin
even commented that my face looked great
great for very sheer coverage
it is so strong
this is a beautiful product that goes on smoothly
this was a success for me
this is too much for my skin
this is not so great for mature skin.
this is just fair
it was a good product for me for a bit.
nothing really amazing about this product
that thing is by far the best for me so far
my skin is only getting better
his words: "not bad, nothing special."
it made me breakout.
another thing that really bothers me about this product isn't the product itself
it is like a very course s
my skin feels great
a little goes a long way
it lasts a very long time
it felt really heavy
i'll use the whole thing
this was just terrible for me
i also feel like its a fairly think cream.
it looked good by itself on my skin
which is neat in concept
it goes on nice.
this was definitely not helpful for that
this product is just "okay".
i don't think it worked great as a primer
that's was pretty much the only good thing about this moisturizer
i like the way it feels after it sinks in
this one is very light
as it is a roll-on well imagine it
probably if your skin is very dry this will work wonderful for you
it felt really good when i applied it
this product definitely wasn't for me
while this moisturiser is alright
the product is great
it is very light
i like how it sits on my skin.
everyone has different skin
this product is a good idea
was really excited to try it because it said it was good for sensitive dry skin
this was getting good reviews.
also got this in my very underwhelming play box.
as an added bonus it gave me a nice zit.
the packaging is very well done though
this is a great concept
it looks really neat because of the gold
gets worse as the day goes on
my foundation applies weird
easy it feels great to put it on
used just a little bit
it feels nice on my face in a weird way?
i will say that it looks amazing under my makeup.
it says it's best for this type of skin
it was a horrible fit for me
stays that way on me all day
it makes me breakout very next day
not good for my skin type
it cleans my face but it isn't a game changer.
was very excited about the formula
it was really convenient to bring on a vacation
really just what the title says.
as far as how this product actually performs
very hard to peel off, was not impressed.
i think this product works in the sense that my face felt super smooth after i used it
that one is amazing
really this mask was the worst i've used honestly
love origins products but this is no good.
i loved the way my face felt it did feel weird at first you have to get use to it though it was very strong on the nose
this is not very good at all
the rest was horrible
this mask looks pretty.
not really in a good way
i tried this mask because the color was very interesting
this was not a pleasant experience
this makes the application of my foundation streak quite a bit
the title says it all.
the product itself is actually really nice
it was pretty good
this one wasn't really all too special.
however it made my skin breakout like crazy
a little goes a long way with this guy
my experience wasn't good at all
which is really such a shame
it is really refreshing
everyone who uses it loves it
it looks so pretty.
i will say the texture of the product itself is very interesting
this one was just okay for me
would be a good primer
as it works well
but, this product is just bad.
this is basically just a st
there is nothing here for sensitive skin.
it is however quite the opposite
it feels great on my skin
it feels nice going on the skin
t's easy for it to get everywhere
i only used a small amount it felt really nice.
it is very shocking at first
this feels like it just sits on top
rough going on to me
because there's 3 of what looks the same on the website
only good thing about it is the added sun protection
it was absolutely awful to my skin
the murad is honestly the only thing that truly keeps me matte
the little bad things outweigh the good for me
it goes on like a primer
very expensive for what it does
this did matify very nicely
a little goes a long way
not in a good way
it really depends on what consistency works best for you skin
it looks good by itself
this would be great
i wanted this to be good so badly.
it felt so good
the product doesn't last very long
unfortunately it hasn't done much for me
it made me breakout
hope it gets better
it feels like a waste of money
it is not a game changer
my skin still looks awful
it goes on reasonably well under / with foundation
the only reason i gave it 2 stars so far is because the smell is horrible
this has done absolutely nothing for my skin
it worked wonders for my skin in just one week
i love fresh but this one is kind of so so.
on your face is a bit of an experience
the consistency is not for me
i give it 2 stars because it smelle good
the $80 cdn price tag really puts me off- this isn't a product i feel i need in my regiment
which is why it got 2 starts
however, it felt a little masky to me.
nice message to the face
i've heard a lot of good things of it before
not in a good way
the "glow" that it gives did not look very good
this stuff works great--leave a youthful
really turns me off to it
a big plus for me
which is great for foundation!
this is too little.
it feels nice while it's one
this is not a terrible mask
goes on easy enough
to get this thing off is awful!
my title says it all.
it was good at first
its nothing special to be completely honest
didn't feel as amazing as other said
result not very impressive
the product is not bad
since my skin was doing so well
it was really nothing special
while it is fun to apply
definitely not the greatest
it felt great putting on
it felt great on
it's pretty disappointing because the sales associate talked all about how great the mask is for sensitive skin
the whole process was very relaxing
the mask was nice
did a good job of warming
only if something is really good or really bad
and this.. is really bad.
got a good 4-5 uses out of it
end results after washing off we're not exciting.
this was just disappointing
this product really worked great
not in a good way
it is not a winner for me
i like the way this is gentle
a little goes a long way!
the concept of the product plumping my face was really intriguing to me
it feels a little bit plumping going on
this product is amazing
does exactly what it says – plumps up the skin noticeably for sure
this product felt absolutely amazing on the skin
this mask is fun to use
although it was fun to try
wonderful things about this product
just feels so heavy
it was definitely fun to use
the concept looked exciting
the idea is cool, and it was fun to remove.
this one wasn't working for me
all in all, fun, but not essential.
the magnet part was super awesome.
the only thing good about this mask is that its fun to use
it was a little tricky to apply
it was fun touse
honestly it works the same
the mask itself is just alright
it felt nice to apply it
it was a bit much.
it seems to work great for everyone else
it sets really fast by the time i was done mixing
a real disappointment from a line that i really like
tight feeling is not a good thing
it's really disappointing that this product didn't work the wonders for me as it did so many others who left great reviews
that in itself is a deal breaker for me
it goes on smoothly
it goes on nice
feels great going on
it feels great going on.
'm being pretty honest to say this is not a good product
not that great for the face.
it goes on easy
not the lifting good kind of tight
using it pretty much daily
tight in a bad way :(
it seemed like worked like a magic for some people
to make it really work
did much better job itself
so for me personally this product was definitely unnecessary
because the consistency was nice
the coverage are awesome
a little goes a long way
however my experience with it has not been ideal
maybe someone has successful tips for me.
does not look good on fair skin; much to dark
a little goes a long way.
does a nice job of removing foundation
got this thinking it would be an awesome cleanser
it comes in such a big bottle
well this is just horrible.
it made my foundation look awful
this made my foundation look awful.
was disappointed with this primer
the finish was nice
when applying this primer it felt very nice
overall, this was really disappointing.
this is really like an other eye cream.
a small amount goes more than a long way so a jar lasts forever
it just looked awful
take great care of my skin
feels good putting it on-
the video made it look great
looks like i'm back on the hunt for something else
this is a very disappointing package.
and it works beautifully with the first few uses.
this cream is very nice.
i feel it has done some good.
no real miracle here
it made me breakout
this product is definitely not for me
you make some good stuff
everything it claims matches my needs
it was great on my skin
it just sits there
the ingredients in it are fantastic overall
a little goes a long way.
it just holds everything in
ultimately it does a great job of protecting your skin
it feels nice going on
it takes forever to blend in
the only good thing is it feels very hydrating when first applied
thought it would be perfect for me
the good part is yes
it pretty much is make-up
it works if you have pretty nice skin already.
this stuff is very light on me.
i found that this product made my entire face look very shiny
not in a flattering way at all
which was pretty disappointing
it was very obvious
it is not a good base for foundation
sounds like it works better for people with light skin
the consistency was also too think for my liking.
a little goes a long way.
thankfully sephora is terrific about returns.
i am going to return this because it feels heavy
it says he likes it
it just makes it look worse
this one falls a little short for me
it goes away pretty quick
hopefully my skin goes back to normal
my skin has been great
wrinkles here we come
this product is not for me.
this feels so nice on the face
i think this is just as effective
turns out it wasn't that great.
the product works really well for getting off foundation
i find the whole process so strange
i really wish this worked for me as it seems to work for everyone else
i really like how this makes my skin feel
consistency as well as how nice it leaves the skin
which is always a small miracle for me
even though it feels nice on my face
overall it just isn't particularly amazing to me
it feels good on the skin
i think it is actually pretty effective
some good products do wonders
there is nothing lightweight about this.
this is a great product.
it feels like a quality product
it is just okay.
it's a good mask in the fact that it feels nice going on
this stuff is amazing
the product itself is nice
it made me breakout like crazy
the one who gets a breakout from a product everyone else loves
the product itself is incredible.
really really really good
it was much better
this product is terrible
it is hard to describe
this one was bad
it is very rich
all of which sounded amazing
i think the face cream is nice
i think the cream works well
that is just unheard of for me
this product is too strong for my skin type
this was my favorite part of the two step process
this one was nice
this set is alright.
but overall great product!
is as natural as it gets
it makes a huge mess
i felt like this was a pretty good cleanser.
totally believe that it works in really getting your face clean
this is unusual for me most products don't make me breakout
i really was hoping this would be something great
the oil comes out way to fast
it goes on nicely
the bar is nice and i like the lather it gives.
was a little concerned about changing as i have super sensitive skin: i think the system is really great interms of removing dirt
i think this product is good but not great.
it was kind of hard
the product itself is really good for sensitive skin yet cleans well enough for my combo skin
the consistency is very interesting and unusual.
so far my under eye looks the same
only nice thing about the product is that it mosifurizes under your eye
definitely returning this product.
not great for what the turnout looks like
this product looks somewhat good until you step into the light
it is really pretty
this goes on really nice
nothing natural about it at all
this was an awful product
it was just overwhelming
it feels nice on the skin
when you put it on the face it looks like a very light highlight
commented on how ridiculous it looked
it looked really promising
this was definitely a miss for me.
definitely not by itself
so this just makes my skin look worse
although the highlight was nice
it was in no way flattering
using a little as a highlight is hard.
i like it a lot better
this one was definitely a miss for me
the results look great
i did not feel like it worked great for under the eye circles
this is a great product for a quick fix
the consistency was okay
this does great for the drynes.
there really is very little benefit above
that's nice because it feels good after a long day
it really wasn't very good either
it was kind of a weird consistency
this eye balm reminds me a lot of that product
it works perfect after that
i guess the formula feels nice on your fingers
had a lot of success with it
it makes me breakout
decent but not incredible.
this product probably works great
unfortunately, this just doesnt work.
so this is sadly going back
work better for young
works well under make up
it goes on very smoothly
if that makes sense
i'll still with my de as it seems much better.
so hopefully it isn't.
plus the primer itself smells really good
this primer is great for under foundation
a little goes a long way.
it definitely is not the same product
it is really nice by itself, but not as a primer.
not great as a primer
the consistency is great
i feel this sometimes separates my foundation
this was a exceptional nightmare.
it goes on smoothly
it goes on smoothly
it would be good if you have flawless skin
my foundation looked amazing again
the way it feels
the fact that it has some kind of shimmer to it is not the best
feel it plays well with my skin
it does work well as a primer
this always leaves a lot of product on
it does a pretty good job at removing my make up
it hasn't done much
the formula however was nice
that is where it starts
was definitely a waste of money
this did nothing to perfect my skin
this is definitely not a bad product
it does make the skin look pretty
which is an accomplishment in itself
for me this one is going back
it takes a really long time for my face to absorb the product
true foundations for me
definitely not good for my face
which gets really bad during the winter
it feels very nice going on
does well with any foundation
it leaves this weird film on your skin that is terrible for priming- foundation tends to ball up
initially it made my face feel amazing.
really work well as a primer
this product is difficult to work into your skin
feels so good when you put it on
it goes on so smooth
the serum from the same line is nice though!
it was really strange.
it feels like nothing on the face
you would think its very natural
this product is definitely has something that is not good for you
it takes very little product to cover the whole face
it takes a lot for it to actually do a solid job
the ingredients are just horrible!
that's where the benefit ends
it definitely has staying power
the color stinks it is way too dakr for me.
because this is definitely medium
the idea behind this is awesome
the product actually works very well
which makes me very sad because this really controlled my oil
but the packaging is really bad in my opinion.
i still think the product itself is absolutely amazingly
it is nothing spectacular
that's pretty much all it had going on
my highlight was always the first thing to go
it feels so heavy
also gives a shine to my face which is already is pretty oily
it goes nice under make up
i brought this because it seems like a good two in one product
the cream itself was way too heavy for me
in the meantime it is a nice product
this product is definitely not for sensitive skin as it has made me break out like crazy
maybe it will be a wonderful product for you.
so to me this is very
this was too heavy for me
its really a shame as it did work so well with the exception of breaking me out
we could've been great together
this cream feels really good to put on.
the way the product looks is very eye catching
the only reason i give it a few stars is because it smells great
also it look horrible under make up !!!!!!!
when the sa tried it on my hand it felt amazing.
this product was very disappointing
this product does wonders for the skin
this concentrate was a big disappointment for me.
use everything she makes
a little goes a long way.
it just didn't work great for me
reading this- it feels good
this product is definitely very greasy.
it goes on like desitin
this is too much
it feels like i'm spreading
the consistency is amazing
it feels great on the skin
the quality is certainly there
it was not a good look.
it feels like it weighs down my face
it makes it not as heavy
way to much for me.
this was a little too overpowering for me
it is so disappointing
gave me awful bumps
this is the first time that this happens to me with a product
this was just my personal experience with this formula
it kind of "sits" on my skin
this product is just okay.
probably great for more mature skin
this is the most disappointing product ever.
this makes no sense
this serum felt nice at first
performs great under foundation
the bottle is small but a little goes a long way.
this stuff does a great job if you like matte looks
it definitely works better over foundation
not great or game changing
this is definitely not a primer
this product is really unique.
nothing seems to work for them
the best thing about the biossance eye gel is that it's very cooling
feels great going on
it does a good job of keeping the skin under
i hoped at first it was a good thing
obviously this is an hg product for some people
it gave me a really bad reaction
worked really hard on this
when you put it on it feels nice
it has done nothing
one positive is that it does absorbs fast into the skin which is nice
this feels good going on
normally this kind of formula would work for me
although i like the way this makes my skin feel it broke me out pretty bad within a week
makes my skin feel good when i put it on
is that it takes a bit of time to absorb
a little goes a very long way
this seems like a great product
so far it's really done nothing for me
this one reminds me of the feel of some others
this product helped a little
overall the product wasn't for me
it works just fine
i used this for a good 2 months and it was great.
pros: a little goes a long way.
your experience with this product isn't anywhere near as bad as mine was
the pump is a bit hard to work with
was extremely excited to try it because my skin gets very oily throughout the day
overall as a moisturizer this feels really nice.
felt good going on
t takes a lot to keep me shine free all day
which is not that big of deal to me
it does make me feel good
it has done nothing
it is very sheer
i wish this worked better with my skin because it feels so comfortable on the skin
this one jhad a lot of nice things
it works pretty good.
stops working for a bit
alternating skin care (for me) is the best thing.
feels great when you first put it on
i feel i could probably find something just as good that my skin likes a bit better
so here it is again
the only good things are the nice texture
unfortunately it made me breakout
which is all right
not everything works for everyone
it was just the right consistency
this has a nice small
definitely could've been a different product that did this
if anything it just sits on top of the skin
this one has a lot more hype
my first impression of it was this is really oily
i put my foundation on it looked really nice with it the oil as a base
overall i tried everything with this
felt pretty good when i first bought it
nothing so amazing to be worth $54
unfortunately the product was really great
hopefully it's a better product than this one.
but clear skin is way more important to me.
nothing especially just looks nice it does sink in
it does a good job of making my foundation last all day
the hype behind it makes it intriguing
so many youtubers raved about it being the best primer ever
not a good primer in my opinion.
not a whole lot more
it made my foundation pull in such a weird way
its definitely going back.
i learned a very valuable lesson after trying this one
honestly it made to difference to bethe packaging is pretty
the one upside is that it smells very pretty.
it was not good
it was not a great primer either
this primer is neat.
a lot still comes off
i feel like the product also just stays on my skin
was super excited because it smells so good
because a tiny bit goes a long way!
it is incredibly light
it has not worked for me
it feels really nice once you put it on
it takes a while for it to be smooth
this new formula is a lot like that
i don't think it absorbs very well
i think overall the product is a nice quality
do like that aspect
thats how amazing the old formula was
it honest to got gave me a headache because of how strong the scent was
this product is a big disappointment.
it most definitely is not!
a little went a long way on my face which is great
this product is great at first.
so this is great at really resurfacing my skin
tatcha makes great products-- except for this.
the 4stars is because it takes quite a bit to cover the entire face
unfortunately something seems to seriously be wrong with the package
it was a nice concept to place a rubber film on my face
it was a weird consistency
the look to this mask was very unique
felt it was only okay
overall i like how easy it was to use
at the same time really cool
the only feature i liked is the fact that it comes in two pieces
this one was difficult to unfold
it fit my face well
fits good enough on the face.
mask is semi fun for a one time try
it looked so neat
love the way the mask feels
use the spot lift that are fantastic
which is a little disappointing
it was very relaxing
the price is way too much for something that does so little
thought it looked very cool
the packaging was quite nice
was that it felt great while it was on
just kinda sits on top
it was a fun one time experience
this one is not as good
worked excellently for me on that scale
the product works great
it absorbs great and the packaging is super nice.
just too good of a job on my skin
this is much too light.
it feels really nice going on the skin
the cream consistency makes it hard to spread
the deal breaker for me is that it seems to greatly accentuate the fine lines around my eyes
very quickly goes away
while the eye cream is disappointing only really in so far as the packaging
good genes is still my all time favorite
it has lasted remarkably well– a little goes a long way
the breakout was very obviously from this product
this product did a really good job of getting rid of my makeup however
for some reason it always feels like i pumped my eyes full of this
it was great on the rest of my face
the product does work well
not a horrible product but not impressive either.
gives the perfect amount
:( i'm very upset, as this thing costs an arm.
the formula seems great with all the right ingredients
glad it is working better for others!
the only thing nice about this mask is how cool it feels when it bubbles up
just not a very good product all around
i feel this packaging is poorly done.
it was really nice on my skin when i used it
this is a beautiful product in terms of consistency
this product has been working great on my normal/dry skin
was quite excited to try this new one
the cleanser overall is a very nice consistency
it is not great around the eyes as it stings terribly
there is so much great skincare to try out there now
this just was awful for my skin
does a decent job cleansing
unfortunately, this product is a huge miss.
obviously wasting a lot of product
there is nothing super spectacular or innovative about it other then it's solid
the reviews looked great
the jar is very big
the gold one is really nice
it definitely says what it claims
it was nothing too-too special
the mask works okay
but a great way to try it out with a cute design
it was fun to use because of the colour
this thing is pretty much gone
'the mask itself is quite nice, however.
it is so awful
it was not a healthy "that means it's working" feeling
ironic since this is supposed to work on sensitive skin
however, it really worked.
this is just a fun one
i think it works great
this is an interesting product.
it is fun to use
that seems to work best
it is now a small little ball
this product is really fun
can do something interesting with the same old same old
while it was fun to try
it gets points for being fun
it isn't going to last very long at all.
overall the product itself isn't great
the idea was good though.
however, the good stops there.
this product is fun
found that to be quite nice on my combo skin
this product definitely feels light
which is a good thing
which is extremely disappointing
thought it had to be amazing
my face usually knows how to balance itself out
think the hype over this is how amazing it smells
the hype was not real on this one.
it just seems pretty average.
the packaging is also nice too.
it makes foundation application look amazing!
got this as part of a vib gwp
(thanks sephora for the awesome return policy!)
it does have good ingredients
everything else was good
this product comes in second for me
i really hope it was just a fluke
it felt really nice on my skin
it takes some getting used to
this is good serum but not excellent.
it goes pretty fast.
i've kind of gotten used to it
a little goes a long way.
it sure feels like it
this product is terrible
while my skin feels wonderful right after using the product
it seemed to do the opposite of what it advertises
it becomes a bit harder to spread
start doing all of the wonderful things it said it would
it felt pretty nice when i first put it on
it was nothing impressive
it seemed like a nice
feels really nice on the skin
for me the absolute deal breaker is the scent.
this mask isn't going to be phenomenal
it gives a very nice cooling sensation when you do so
first, this is a great product.
it seemed like it would be great for my skin
it was a good product
a little goes a long way trust me
my skin feels great for the day
this product would be fabulous
this has really really helped
it felt amazing the first day
it feels really nice at first application
nothing looked nice over this.
incredible for my skin
the only positive thing i can say about this is that the purple color is really pretty
have had great success with this line
this product is a pass for me.
i wanted to love this because the idea of what it's supposed to accomplish in theory sounds great
coverage is good enough for everyday wear
i'll keep wearing it and see how it looks.
however with that came pretty bad breakouts
think that is what it is from
the oil has a very nice
i think the product was good
see how my skin progresses
which is always something i look for after ingredients
breaking out was a huge drawback for me
the serum felt nice going on
a little goes a long way
while it felt very nice going on my skin
it feels great on the skin
i found it very nice in the aspect of hydration
getting a $7 spot treatment that worked wonders
mess with a very good thing
this was a good product, but not my favorite.
not in a good way
this gel product definitely does what it claims.
this is good as in it does the job
it feels so weird on the skin too.
it's working much better for me.
good for people who have pretty normal skin that that want to perfect
not for someone with terrible skin seeking amazing results
product felt like it was working great after i put it on
it sits just fine
the combo it great
a little goes a long way so it lasts forever.
the cream is kind of in a solid
it does feel nice on the skin
this truly is nurturing.
i think it cleans great
unfortunately, it ends there.
i like the fact that it is natural
i know it has great ingredients
'm not really sure about its brightening effects
it was a bit weird on the consistency
it would be a really nice cream
the only good thing i can say is that a little goes a long way
it feels like it sits on top of the skin
it even feels good going on.
there is a different feel
every time it gives me pretty bad
looks like it works better for a lot of other people
it was really disappointing!
it looks about the same
i just thought my skin was going through a transition
this is a deal breaker for me.
it also has a pretty sticky
this one is definitely a no-go for me
i really wanted to like this product based off the great reviews
it does the job with my combination skin
it feels atrocious in your hand.
i like a lot of the ingredients
look for something with better ingredients :
it also hasn't made me breakout which is great considering how moisturizing it is
the consistency is weird
but this one really disappoints me.
now the sad part
it felt like it absorbed nicely
very nice... but not nice enough for the price.
which is always a good thing
this cream is really not for me
so many great reviews
however, it does soak in well and feels nice.
this stuff came highly recommended to me
my face feels nice after this product
lovely way to start your day.
it was a great way to try this out
the reason i'm giving it 3 stars is because it smells really really bad
i really like the way it feels on the skin.
everything about it is different
it's a very disappointing experience with philosophy
in theory this is great
this product was so-so for me.
it has a weird consistency
because all this has done for me so far is make my face feel hot
my skin did look great although
it's definitely helped with some of my fine lines
i think it did a decent job at keeping them from progressing
it actually works really well as eye cream.
thanks to sephora's fantastic return policy
feel the product work
was really hoping this would really work out for me
it is a real disappointment
this does feel nice under the eyes
overall the product is no good.
it feels nice going on
not working very well
it does feel really nice on the eyes
there is nothing very special about it
even though it feels nice
it does have a refreshing
it does have a nice cooling effect which feels refreshing
like to use something good for tired eyes
was very hopeful with this product
it feels nice when you apply it
it has done nothing
this definitely helps with that
this mask is ok at best.
this mask is nothing special
it was so disappointing.
i am sure it is great on other skin type
it is also really messy
it was just awful.
it got great reviews on sephora
this product feels nice
there's still a lot of make-up coming off
don't think it deserves 1 star
not oily which is a good thing
this product just isn't doing it for me.
this was a totally different
it was lovely--"what i'd take to a desert isl
not as good as the old formula.
this product is nothing like the old product.
this new formula is very bad though.
the new formula is awful
i definitely seems like that was a bad call
was extremely happy with it
hopefully this review helps!
which is very disappointing
lately its just not loving this product even though at some point it was a godsend
this stuff is the worst!
that works wonderfully for me
her skin is totally different i am rating it as high as i am simply because it smells good
this product has a lot of natural ingredients which i liked
product runs out really fast as well.
it's hard to control how much product comes out with each twist
that worked very well
i used the entire thing
overall nothing fantastic, but good product.
that work really well
it seems like a complete waste of my money.
so far so good i think.
thought it was perfect
the pump also makes it really easy to use.
i would definitely repurchase because it really does do a great job of hydrating the skin
this was pretty disappointing.
comes in nice bottle pump.
almost no frangnance, which is good.
good for the money.
felt like it worked pretty well
it feels nice when i apply it
has done nothing for my skin
it did feel great going on
i really like the way it feels on my eyes.
a little goes a long way
this helps somewhat, but it's not great.
my guess is that it works much better on younger skin
this was super disappointing
the worst thing about it is that it makes my face look white because it does not blend in
it just kind of sits on your skin
it was too strong for my husb
it comes with a lot of product for a great price
which was amazing for just using it once
some firming with just one use which is awesome
that was not my experience
it also worked fine for my skin
my skin developed really bad breakout
this product is way overhypes!
this one was definitely a miss
t's really sad to learn that it no longer works well for my skin
it was okay a best.
i feel like it gets the job done
what all the hype is about
it has done nothing
this was nothing special
i tried this cleanser with high hopes because of all the wonderful reviews
it definitely is a no for me
it was so horrible
it made me breakout bad
although this felt really nice
all that happened was it made my skin extremely
which is especially bad for my rosacia
i really tried to give it a good amount of time to work its magic--
it feels nice on my skin as well
this is a "good to have"
this is a nice happy medium
it feels great on the skin
the packaging however is so frustrating.
it is not a bad product
he raved about how amazing this product is
on about how great this stuff is
was pretty excited to try it out at home
this formula was just not for me
this works a little bit
i think it was a good start
it never worked for me
even though it felt nice applying
seemed great on paper
that definitely wasn't my experience
there are an awful lot of ingredients in it
its just really frustrating
hoping for some kind of breakthrough
so far, nothing really.
worked great for a little while
works well under make-up
it is quite a hassle adding another step to my daily routine
a little goes a long way.
it is also very messy.
it is a good product
it does clean my skin pretty well
the bar itself lasts you a long time
the bar itself works great.
thank you sephora for your excellent return policy
it's a great product if you have the patience for it
a hard pass for me sadly :(
while this is a great
to me this was nothing really special.
that's pretty much what it feels like.
yes, it feels nice.
it worked great for that along with a really good moisturizer
it does feel good after having an allergic reaction to something
this made it feel better
stays for a long time
it felt really great going on
for me, this was terrible.
i like that this is a good base for foundation
a little goes a long way
takes a little bit of time to absorb.
because it does feel nice
this felt so so so good on my skin
this stuff was too strong
nice glow however the ingredients are no good
it feels nice on the skin
the moisturizer itself feels great going on
it really felt heavy
also the consistency is just weird.
it always felt kind of sticky
the amount of pimples i have now is unbelievable
this product seems to break me out
felt this product very mildly helped
seems like a lot of money for no real results.
a little goes a long way with this serum
though it is a really gentle
i feel that the bottle is way too small
this isn't really a "little goes a long way" product
it made me breakout like crazy
not in a good way
it seems to be working fine that way
the product works very well
it does feel cool
feels good going on
it does work a little
now i know that the guy simply has good genes :
it was so bad and too much for my skin.
was very good about using it every day
it was not the game changer for me that it seems to be for most
my foundation last much shorter with this thing underneath
this one definitely isn't my thing
this takes time to set
this is a nice product
although if feels nice on my face
it hurts something awful
the cleanser itself seemed really nice.
it was a little too strong for me
does the job well
it is really nice
so that part is definitely a 5.
i think this is a good product for some just not for me
i like the product it works very well
it is very hard to get the product out
the pump is hard
it looked absolutely horrendous!
definitely feels like it provides a good cleanse
good face wash, nothing that great.
feels great on the skin
this is not a good product for me
'm hoping the hype of murad's pore treatment follows through
although i suppose this is an improvement of sorts
this product in particular was awful!!
the product is concentrated so a little does go a very long way
this product is very disappointing.
- great value: you get a good amount
formerly it was exactly perfect
this is a really nice soothing product
still, it feels nice.
felt like it was much too heavy
it is very rich
very nice cream all it is missing is spf
my skin is very dry; it didn't improve.
it is a good consistency
it is pricey and little goes a long way.
hopefully that one works better.
easier what is good under my makeup too
it has really saved my skin
it feels really light going on
although it feels nice on the skin
this one seemed great at first—smells fresh
it absorbs quickly and a little goes a long way.
it is a pretty basic cleanser that gets the job done
my overall feeling is: it is not nearly as good as clinique
that is good enough for me
this had good reviews
hopefully i'll find one that gets the job done
this didn't accomplish my goal.
this product is no better
this product felt great going on
she said this was a good bet
it works just fine
goes great under make up
and the jar does look huge.
this is actually very light
this was not good
the guy pumped up this item as to how well it was going to work
nothing great i haven't seen any kind of great difference
goes on very lightly
really wanted this one to work.
it has done nothing for my fine-lines
it lasts a long time, which is the only perk.
but it was just awful.
the productbwas too strong for me
so the product itself is great
a very nice technician helped me to choose a different product which i'm hoping will work
it's worked quite good
this stuff has definitely helped
it does have a nice cooling feeling when you first put it on
other then that it just feels cool
i still feel that it doesn't live quite up to the hype it has earned
sadly this continues to burn just as badly
which is fantastic if you've got sensitive skin
it is actually quite tough to wash off
what in it is so bad that it makes me break out?
this product is a great way to waste money quickly
it doesn`t work for me.
this goes on smoothly
i really like the consistency
one good thing came out of this experience though
feels great on skin
my 70-year-old skin is in pretty good condition
it makes no sense.
it is true that a small amount of product goes a long way
it was absolutely amazing
this is the only thing i've found that works
well the result is bad :
the consistency is also really awful.
this winter was extremely bad for me
the formula's consistency is quite odd
this cream looks just right
a little goes a long way
it is great for no make-up days
the consistency of this product makes me feel as though i'm doing more harm than good
the reviews on this one are really good
the formula just felt too heavy for me.
a bit disappointing if you have very dry
it didn't feel like it was absorbing well.
this product is thick but not in a good way.
there is no way i'd put something that smells like that on my face everyday
this is definitely not my favorite
overall, it works well.
not in a good way
it gets gross pretty fast
it lathers so well and not much is needed.
is the only thing that has ever worked to clear up my skin
it covers it up pretty well so that is a plus i guess
a little goes a long way as well
my experience is that this is good but not great.
it doesn't really work amazingly as an eye cream.
it feel great going on.
feel neutral about the whole experience
this is one of those products that everyone seems to love
it feels really rich
not very like it
it was pretty good
felt really good on the skin
their makeup is quite good though.
it was really weird
it also makes your skin feel very tight in a bad way
feels great-a permanent addition to my routine now
it feels awful on the skin
all of the praise this product gets
feels great as a h
this is a good choice
used every single bit
i've had pretty bad dark circles my whole life
in fact it feels nice
it hasn't really done much for me
it goes on very smooth
it feels good on my eyes
this one was a big nothing.
feel of this is amazing
this is very simple in that it feels really nice
definitely not the product for me!
it goes on well
it seems to be working
who works outside a bit
with all the good reviews about how it's amazing for oily skin i had to try it
it feels good once you apply it
my foundation looked great
this was an okay product
a little goes a long way
it was okay, but not that great.
this mask is really pretty
it makes my skin look and feel great.
this is a good product
it goes by super fast
it is not awful
it feels really energizing
it doesn't do a whole lot in the way of skincare
definitely not any kind of miracle worker
a little goes a long way
is not a terrible product
very rich, too much for me!
i like how it feels on the skin though.
it was doing fine for my skin.
everything's great about this product.
nothing superb that you can't get from another product with better spf
the only similarity is how easy going the product is to put on the skin
the application was actually good
so far it feels good on my skin
for a product whose name means "well done
it goes on easy
this is a great product
it does a terrible job at removing completely foundation
it lasts very long though
it sounded like it would be an awesome eye cream
it seemed to really work
one thing is that the packaging is a little weird
hopefully see a nice result soon
it feels good when you first put it on
this product is awful
it is a good product
i think it is a great product
i guess the only thing going for it is that it has an spf factor
it is a decent product
while i found the consistency to be nice
i still really enjoy using it because it feels good
so this was a big disappointment.
it is very very mild which i appreciate.
it does a pretty good job as i then tone afterwards
this doesn't have great chops in this area
it was not fantastic
$28 for a face wash is pretty steep considering it doesn't really do much
not in a good way
my skin just got terrible
it was the only thing i was doing different in my skin care routine
definitely not for everyone !
alright so my skin was at a solid plateu.
everyone has a different experience
this one is exactly what it says it is (mild).
not horrible but not amazing.
there was nothing special about it
so this makes me think the ingredients in this product are quite harsh
works really well with my clarisonic brush
it worked very well for her
her face is gorgeous because of this 3 step stuff
nothing extremely amazing about it for me
great price but was so sad.
foundation really emphasised how bad it was
feel great before i put foundation on
definitely helps with oil
it feels great on the skin
this product has been hyped up so much
this is a good primer
i did like this one quite a bit.
it sort of works for me
was really hoping this would work based on the great reviews
well then, something is very, very wrong.
it was great consistency
the product works okay
and this one is just that, decent.
it goes away, but it pretty strong initially.
it does its job
average--nothing speccial--didnt really do anything miraculous for my skin
this goes on light
overall, think i'll keep looking.
it is doing the trick
not great for me
this is is somewhat of a disappointment
my face is quite small
not so great gave me under eye bumps
this was just too strong
this seems to do a good job of smoothing
it goes on smoothly
the formula is very nice & lightweight.
it is a little expensive for what is really is
the cream itself seemed okay
it absorbs pretty well
this is a big problem for me
this is clearly not for everyone.
it is a decent product
it does have a nice gel consistency
i think the formula is too strong
it does feel nice
a little goes a long way
it goes on very smoothly
getting the balm which is amazing
it seemed like a good oil
works wonders but not on my pocketbook!
frankly it is just not that good at it
but this is absolutely terrible.
that stuff takes everything off.
it feels good when you put it on
hopefully the balm is better?
it wasn't as great
this is okay for now
it lasts a lot longer
the only good thing about it is it makes your skin soft
this is the only product that has really disappointed me
though this product is indeed very gentle
it just doesn't remove my foundation very well
this one was disappointing
i think it works better for foundation
doesn't really clean well
this product does a pretty decent job taking face makeup off only
this does a horrible job
it was doing a good job at moisturing
to me this feels more like a day cream.
it makes my skin feel nice after i put it on
like most of the shiseido products it goes on smoothly
hopefully just a fluke thing.
this is a bit strong for my tastes
not in a good way
why it gets such great reviews
so frustrating, as the cream seems to work.
felt it was pretty good
very thick, but i mean that in a good way.
it was nothing special
this product is practically perfect.
i give this product three stars because it truly is a really good product
this is a really good product
however, it is a great matifying product.
it works great under your primer
so that feels nice on you skin
this product is terrible
it is a really light formula
it doesn't do a very good job of helping with shine-control
while this is not a bad product
this was too much
unfortunately it is ideal for night time use
oil just keeps coming
it feels great going on
this has a nice light consistency
so far no luck
this works great around the eyes, though!
this product is a lot like that
it is no good for my skin
i want to keep it because it feels so nice when it lathers
so far he is not really seeing the affects
when i first started to use this product i feel like it's overall good quality meaning the feregrance
this one is great also
this is not a good choice
it really does work
its really awesome as compare to this one
makes my skincolor look odd
i am usually pretty good with shiseido
this stuff just makes that problem issue st
this product is really terrible
it brings fine lines
this product is too rich for me.
though it feels nice
it is what is it
a little goes a long way
as bad as it was for me
there is nothing that amazing about this eye cream
which makes a difference in the long run
which is definitely a plus
the reviews gave it a really positive hype
bought this with pretty high hopes considering the raving reviews
it feels nice because it seems to be pretty moisturizing
how long it lasts as you only need a tiny bit
this clinique works much better than it
i think this is a great product
i find the texture of it is a much better fit for me
there is nothing special about it
it runs out very fast
huge disappointment as well.
thought it was fabulous
maybe because it is too balancing?
that was a fantastic product
invested in a really good foundation
it seems different now
it felt really nice
put it on i was excited because the gel was so fine
refreshing: i thought it was going to work great
it is very light
feels especially good during the summer.
this product is a definitely no-go.
it could be refreshing
it does feel nice and cooling.
this product feels nice to put on
it seems like a different gel
why is it so hard to find a good eye cream/gel that is natural
it comes out a lot
it does feel refreshing
it does have a wonderful cooling effect
the gel feels great going on
unfortunately this gave me horrible
this product was so disappointing.
i like this product well enough
so as much as this cream feels lovely i don't like what it could be doing behind the scenes
this cream is definitely too much money for what it does
nothing fabulous about it.
extremely difficult to get the product out
what i got is an okay mask that is very messy to apply
it has just okay results
the mask was good but not great.
i like how it feels
absolutely haaaate the way it comes now
this product goes on dry which i thought was quite interesting
this product is wonderful.
the new glass bottle is absolutely terrible.
first off, this product is amazing.
this is a great product
as the saying goes
this awful pump makes it difficult to get enough product out
the product was much too harsh for me
hopefully it'll work better over time.
i feel like it really does the job only thing is it makes my face a little oily
my face in general just looks so much healthier
this stuff has done a fairly good job of clearing up my skin so far
found it to work very well
it feels good though.
also, feels kind of sticky.
it only helped a bit
has done a great job of keeping my acne in check without overdrying
it has done absolutely nothing for my skin
nothing has worked so far
it certainly felt like it would work!
it had great reviews
philosophy is a fantastic brand, all around.
the only good thing about this cleanser is that you need very little amount
i did not like the consistency of this product it is too thin
overall so much better
this night just didn't work very well for me.
feels great on the skin
it works well under make-up
seems to me to be just a nice average hydrator.
for something that merely feels good
it feels nice going on
not as powerful as it thinks it is.
i really think that it is remarkably average
i feel like this moisturer is good
their products have done wonderful things for my skin
not in a good way
this is probably a great product for people with balanced skin
unfortunately, the night cream disappoints me.
i like how lightweight it feels
this was just the new thing to try
she seems to like it
this is not the best product for me
it does clear it up really fast though.
that helps i got the 3 step treatment
the box says one thing
it seems like it helps with oil
it goes on nicely
this does clear up my breakout spots
this stuff is not perfect
it works a little though
it doesn't work as well
this product is too strong
that combination has worked wonders on my skin
overall it was an okay product because it did not lighten my marks up completely
i gave it 2 stars because i like the way it feels on my skin
though this product got very good reviews
obviously it got some great reviews
unfortunately this is a miss for murad.
too pricey for how well it works
my skin does feel good in the morning
this definitely gets the job done
don’t know if it really works with evening skin tone
i think this is probably an excellent cream
it did go on nicely thought
i just think it was too potent for my skin.
a product where a little goes a long way
this has done nothing.
it's not good for people who breakout easily like me as it is very heavy
very hard to blend also.
this cream worked no better
this product is awful.
it came in a really nice
very disappointing since i did notice it was a nice decent size bar for the price
the product is great though
it has done very little for me
it feels really nice on the skin
nothing really outstanding about it.
this one made me breakout so bad i just had to
its just as good or better
at first it was an okay product.
a little really goes a long way as it foams up.
hopefully it starts to work soon though.
very disappointing considering all other boscia products have worked wonders for me
this product only makes it worse
this probably works wonders
it does its job
'm using something a little stronger now
so far so good
i think my skin needs something a little stronger
my skin seems to be pretty content
it does feel good on my skin
it still was no good
it does work well
it is pretty oily like someone else said
felt great when i put it on.
this feels wonderful on my skin
thinking that maybe there was no product/breakout relationship
it makes it worse
it seems very good on my skin
so far i'm kind of pleased
feels very sticky when it goes on
it had a fantastic result
i like the way the mask feels when its on
unfortunately, this mask is really disappointing.
especially with all the good reviews
it feels like it does nothing
it was just as bad
this mask is very strong.
it looked like it is going finish very fast
it has amazing results
i think the product is nice
it can last a long time since a little goes a long way
this is a great product
so once this is done
the cream is very nice
this is great for farmers like me
this has done nothing for my dark circles.
it has done little
unfortunately because it is a great price point
told me this was the best stuff
with all the great reviews
it felt really nice
it just gives the illusion it does
unfortunately i was proven wrong.
works well under make up
i guess one good thing is that a little goes a long way with this product if it works for you
its done absolutely nothing
it was extremely disappointing as the reviews seemed amazing
that seems so great when you first use it
feels nice going on
i really only feels nice going on
product consistency is great.
it was good in the beginning although the smell was quite awful at first
the produce itself is okay
not quite worthy for $52
especially given the amazing reviews on here..
my face gets really try
it works great for me.
it makes me wonder what percentage of people experience this sensation of our reviews never get shared
which was absolutely wonderful
however it does feel lightweight
it was just too strong
it worked great under my foundation.
i found that it was great for use in very hot
this was so strong
probably a awesome product for someone with really dry skin
i am usually quick to see the good in imperfect products
i want a product that feels good on the skin.
a little goes a long way
was not the right fit for me
it has a very strong
this cleaner at first was great
the product does work nicely.
not the good tight
better off with nothing.
this has not worked for me
this product just is not working for me
she said well try this stuff
has not done a thing for me
this one was too strong
this product is definitely not right for me.
it is a good thing that sephora is good about exchanges
this one seems to work well
told me how good it was
though it does the job fine
really good at first
a little goes a long way
the cream felt great going on
that's a whole lot of money for a whole lot of nothing
the most frustrating part
thats really the only good thing about it
overall, no amazing results, just clean!
which i think is a really bad sign
this was not good for me.
terrible product at an equally terrible price
it definitely is what my skin needed
very disappointing considering i only get half way through the product before it goes rotten
this product made me break out terribly
was really excited because i got a really nice sample size as a perks reward
a little goes a long way in its use.
does a great job of cleaning.
it seems to be a natural
this product is so bad which made me breaks out everyday
that one really good
a small amount goes a long way.
a little goes a long way.
it seems to work good
it felt way too rich
it is pretty horrible
which is very disappointing because i actually do like the cream
this is the only stuff i added to my routine.
the pump is great
more like it is a film
not even the natural kind
product is nice, packaging isn't great.
while they product is nice it isn't great
what i like is that this a natural product
the only thing i do really enjoy is that it seems to keep my skin a bit more mattified
this cream is pretty average
there is nothing that makes it exceptional
which i was very close to doing
on about how great it is
it feels good when first applied
still have overall nice skin
this is a pretty good
it is a little heavy for me
this would be very nice
a little bit goes a long way :
went on smooth, felt really nice.
nothing special about this cream.
it takes hours to absorb into my skin-very unfortunate
i feel that is has a great effect as far as moisturizing goes
this is definitely not for my skin type.
on my face it feels like i just applied it
it still feels like i just put it on
for me it is just so-so.
it has not really helped my fine lines
a little goes a long way
i got this as a sample - good thing too.
looks the same as always
it's a great way to try new products
this mask is definitely refreshing as others have commented
she said it felt amazing
it feels very nice on
good effect, but makes me break out a little bit.
nothing special shows on my face
this was way too much for me
this felt amazing while using
it wasn't very enjoyable being so careful using it every time
this is definitely going back
it is definitely not my go to cleansing product.
pros: a little goes a long way.
the only thing it has going for it is the fragrance
while this product has a nice consistency it does
it works like a dream
it is a little too intense
unfortunately the makeup stayed pretty true
this product does well too
it did not turn out quite *as* exciting as i thought it was going to be
unfortunately, this product made me breakout.
the product itself here is great
it feels good on the skin
this oil is amazing if it works for you.
i wished it worked on me as it did look phenomenal in the beginning
this is a "pretty good" product.
it also felt very nice.
works a whole lot better
luckily sephora has a great return policy!
all the ladies in the shop said how good this product was
luckily sephora has a great return policy!
the only issue is that it goes by fast!
$65 every month is pretty steep
but usually a wonderful product.
it feels great on my skin in the morning
at first it does feel nice on the skin
that was the weird part
it is a great spf
it was so much better
now it seems as if my skin is reacting to something
well this feels great on and goes on smoothly.
know this is good to my skin
this face wash is pretty good
it pretty much does the job
the good thing about this product is that it's only got nice natural ingredients
a little goes a long way
however it just doesn't control shine very well.
which i think work well
this mattifier wasn't very good
worked great as a primer
it feels nice once applied
it still stinks well after i've applied it.
this was not a good match to my skin type.
it made my face feel kind of stif also
this was definitely a miss for me
it doesn't feel so great on
a little goes a long way
am now going back to what works
this is not terrible, just not for me.
which is a good thing over all
it gives me a greasy look for the whole day
thought this would equally amazing
but this product feels like it is not absorbing.
they work great on my skin
a little goes a long way
it goes on nicely
so far so good.
a little goes a long way and it is lightweight.
the feel of this product was nice
this one feels like a waste
this one was not good for me
its a good thing it was just a small sample
this is working well for me.
this is probably a good cream
it was way too strong for me.
that is a really good idea
found nothing great in this product
it felt way too light
nothing else worked for my sensitive
the way it feels on my face is nothing like the way it used to feel
this felt great on my skin in the store.
i like the consistency
it is really heavy
very little product for the money.
the real problem was how tacky it felt on the skin
i got my typical reaction to something breakout
it was just not a good product for me
this was definitely not for me
it was great at first
frist, this is too much for this small product.
this product makes my face really tight after i use it
it is good to use with the clarisonic
okay so here is my thing with this cleanser!
it wasn't anything impressive
it was nothing exciting
unfortunately, it does waste a lot of product.
my skin is towards combo so this works perfectly fine for me
what i like best about this is the container.
i like the way it feels
it goes on very nicely
which is really disappointing
00 for this is way too much
this feels good on my skin
consistency are not a great fit with my oily
not a bad product, but far from my favorite.
it feels so good
i always got way too much
there is something in it that is greasy
the container is very neat.
this product is not for everyone.
it's a whole regime that provided me with great results
very disappointing waste of money.
is great for sensitive
it was impossible for me
likes it well enough
it works for my combination skin well for the winter time
also the way the product is dispensed was really interesting at first
t's good for what it is
is a lot of $$ for a very small amount of product
which works best for my skin
good thing about it is that you need very little product in order to cover the entire face
the original formula was magnificent
the product seems very different
even though this says that is is good for sensitive skin
overall i still like it.
the only thing i liked about this cleanser was that it removed my eye make-up pretty well
the packaging itself is neat.
it did feel refreshing for the first week.
i really liked the push down dispenser it was the perfect amount for me every time
i try all the new items to see what is really fabulous
unfortunately not incredibly effective
hopefully this will be a good preventitive.
----definitely better products on the market not quite as expensive that's ---natural
it does feel really nice around my eyes
a little goes a long way
a little goes a long way.
feels like putting on baby oil which seems to work better than this serum
it goes on looking like oil
since it is the same thing
it has made me breakout like crazy!
it smells amazing however it does an average job
nothing great about it.
this product is not for me despite al the great ingridients
the oil itself is alright
this one does a nice job
my face was nice
the product works great
it feels very cool
it does feel good
a little goes a long way
this gel was definitely not for me!
it does have a great consistency
it was quite overwhelming.
a little product goes a very very long way
my biggest issue with this is how it leaves my skin
this however was a totally different experience
i think the age spot gel works a little better from this line
i think it takes time.
good thing is the product lasts a very long time
this product seems to do a lot of wonderful things for a lot of people
this product was too powerful for my fair
this product wasn't a good for for me,
my skin feels good when i put it on
it felt nice when i put it on, though.
this stuff is great because you can feel it working
felt like it was a "fun" mask without great results
this product is amazing.
the product itself is actually pretty great
it also kind of makes me break out a little
take a little bit off that way
it seems to absorb well
it was awful on me
the cream feels nice, but it didn't work for me.
good - no miracles but good
the mask is good
this mask is all right.
this is an alright mask.
it feels great going on
this mask is, well, okay.
this line creates a real problem for me
a shame as the texture is really nice
this one was disappointing
not in a good way
this is pretty strong
i really like the way my skin looks
it seems like a good product overall
it felt wonderful going on
thus does the opposite of what i wanted: makes my skin rough
as everyone else has stated
the texture was so nice going on.
this was an okay product for me.
definitely a pass for me
this was truly unbearable
the product goes on well but stinks horribly.
initially goes on nicely
what i've been doing is keeping it in the fridge
this is absolutely terrible
sad thing is that you actually feel it working on your skin :
because it has gotten some wonderful reviews
'm trying this for now
yet my skin looks and feels amazing!
it does last pretty long
was very excited to start using his products
is a very nice formula
this might do wonderful things for the skin
it was truly amazing
it is a good product overall
'm trying something new now
no luck so far
thought this is going to be as good
it is a great product
and works well with make up.
was hoping for the same greatness
i like this as a night cream as it is really smooth
feels nice when you put it on
does not blend well with make up
a little goes a long way so this will last a very long time
such a shame cause it works
this one was just okay
maybe that means it is working?
it was really good the first time around
not harsh and gets the job done .
while the consistency is great
also because this had really good reviews
all that good stuff
the product goes extremely far
feels nice - very cooling and "awakening".
does absolutely nothing for dark circles
it does feel nice
feels good when applied
it feels pretty nice when going on
it just wasn't working for me
it feels nice in the morning
if feels weird as well
despite the fantastic reviews
'm giving it a bit more time
it feels nice going on
when it comes to products like this
obviously everyone has a different experience with certain products
if feels nice upon application
it was cooling and felt very good though.
there was only one good thing about it: the metal rolling ball felt nice
this product is not for me
it does have a nice consistency
it feels kind of heavy
it was kind of awful
the title says it all.
that it was an nice
this stuff goes a long way!
unfortunately, this was a definite miss for me.
it feels very nice on my face
when i put this on it feels nice
however it does make my face very smooth
it just hasn't worked for me
i really like the way this serum feels
which really stinks for me
feels smooth going on
after doing a lot of research
this product doesn't work very well for me
although my skin feels nice when i put it on
nothing bad, just not great.
this time it feels different
other then that its great stuff
this was far beyond a huge miss
this one is very good
was a bit odd to use the first time as well
while it feels nice on the skin
it goes on easy
paired with a primer versus a foundation also seems to work much better on my type of skin
a little bit goes a long way
this is an awful product.
it was nothing like it
be careful i got a bad reaction experience
a little goes a long way
this product is awful
because it certainly feels terrible for the hot summer months
but it is no "miracle".
i found it to be a decent
i've heard a lot of great things about philosophy
it does its job
perhaps this is a good choice
not good for my skin, at all.
i feel like this made things worst.
i've always had amazing skin
it has done absolutely nothing
not that anyone really cares about that stuff when it comes to achieving clear skin
is easy to work with
maybe it takes time.
love the way it makes my skin feel
am not sure that it is really firming
this is ok but nothing remarkable.
i don't think it absorbs that great.
it barely works now
it is a great deal for what your getting 2oz for 20 1star
i gave it 2 stars because everyone's skin is different
it is definitely lightweight
this was definitely not for me.
the packaging is a little frustrating
this one was only okay.
there was really nothing special about it.
the only good thing is that is easy to use that's it
it is really nice
this product feels really good upon application
continues to feel good after
feels nice to use throughout the day because it is cooling
it feels really nice when you apply it
what's odd is that the sample size of this is the most amazing thing
it also feels nice and cool when putting it on.
the serum itself does nothing for me.
it feels good going on
it feels so nice
is it doing any good?
it is very easy
i only have it 2 stars because it has a nice cooling feeling
it feels great going on.
because not much product comes out
it is a great foundation for the rest of my skin care
the bottle is pretty
it definitely feels good in the skin
i feel this formula made me breakout a lot
i gave this cream a chance based on the incredible good reviews it has
this was way too thick for me
this “pro-youth comfort crème” do essentially the same thing
it goes on smoothly
while my eye area looks like it has not gotten worse this product is not inspiring enough for me to keep buying it
the packaging is also absolutely terrible.
the only good thing i have to say about this product is that it has this nice cooling effect under your eyes
i feel that the product just sits on top of my skin
i find that a little of this cream goes a long way
does absolutely nothing for dark circles
it did feel nice
the line has usually had pretty good products
overall nothing great here at all
it was not excellent nor was it bad
it makes my skin feel pretty nice
it goes on smoothly
this product gets a lot of love in the reviews
it felt good going on
however, it is nothing special.
it feels nice on my eyes
although i like the way this eye cream feels
it seemed to work pretty well
so far so good
she assured me that it served as a great primer as well as an eye cream
the worst part is paying so much money for a product that smells terrible
and it goes on very well with no oily feeling.
this feels so nice
it goes on well
it is a good product
they have worked great for me
what happened to me was scary
my skin now behaves very well
so hopefully this new one works for me
it feels great right after i put it on
in just one 2 uses my skin looked better again
it definitely felt like it was working
this product at first was amazing
overall it did little for me
thought this moisturiser would be perfect for me
this product is close and gives me hope.
nothing has really seemed to help my skin
it seriously feels so amazing on your skin
definitely not made for me.
the company sounds fantastic
my breakout is not as bad
weird because it worked on everyone else
it is a nice feeling cream, is about it.
it has done nothing for my scaring
also, the new pump puts out way too much product.
it feels nice when applied
thought this product would be great for me
it probably works great with retin-a
it goes on very smooth and i only use one pump.
it feels nice on the skin
i wasn't successful trying it
it was extremely disappointing
and this mask does kind of work.
overall: this mask is horrible.
this one is terrible
this mask actually hurts a bit to get off.
it just seems like a waste of money.
it just isn't working for me
bought this thinking it was going to be great.
although it is fun to use
this was very cool to use
had a lot of good reviews
it was fun to use
the only good thing is that my skin feels clean.
why this product has good reviews
it goes on nicely
this is an okay product.
a little goes a long way
first off the formula is great.
it was fantastic in the way of performance
see how that works
this product is not great for my eye area
i think it has helped somewhat.
i do like that this is very lightweight
so sad this product is not working for me.
it does seem to last forever which is nice given the price
i imagine it would work quite well
it is very hard cream
so disappointing... my search continues
i can normally keep my skin pretty decent
seems like this would work very well nice thick formula
it felt good going on, but now it's awful.
it did go on nicely though
this is a nice product
what is all the big hype about this product
it feels nice going on
it is also quite refreshing
really nothing outstanding about it.
no good for my skin unfortunately
this just feels like a primer.
there was nothing really special about it
$50 is a lot for this product --
this product is nothing special
is does little things to fine lines
this cream was nothing special
this product was great in my 20s
now that i'm 30, it feels too basic.
so after hearing how amazing this product i finally gave it a try to see how amazing it works
it absorbs great but it just wasn't for my skin.
both remain true: it feels nice putting it on
the bottle looks nice
this is unusual for me
don't get me wrong this product is absolutely amazing
this was terrible on me
a little goes along way.
it felt amazing on the skin
a little goes a long way
this works for me as a great primer
a little goes a long way
it goes on so smooth
i like the way this feels on the skin
this is not a bad base.
jar is pretty huge
only downside is it breaks me out!
after seeing all of the great reviews
it was horrible for me as a primer
this product is okay
not in a good way
this "instant firm" product sounds too good to be true because it is
so far so good
i did look smoother, this product does its job.
it just feels weird.
obviously the product was gone
ladies, this stuff absolutely works!
almost too good to be true
because this product works way too well to give up that easy
this stuff is amazing.
there goes the product
this product is **almost** totally amazing.
it's like nothing was there in the first place
poor product for how much it is.
it is pricey and hard to work with!
there's a very fine line between putting too much of this product on your face
it goes on patchy and looks awful.
it would be perfect
he raved about it that it must be good
it absolutely tightens things up
on the pro side it does tight your skin an make it look amazing in that respect
it would be great
makes the face look awesome while the product is on
a little goes a long way.
this seemed like a good choice
this product is awful.
it technically works for me i just prefer something that absorbs better
it is very light.
it was really nice with the serum
this is just my experience because everyone has different skin types
one downside is how sticky the consistency is too
not a pleasant experience at all..
it seems to work just fine
definitely something for summer.
told me how amazing it was
it feels dry as well
it seemed to work alright
this is also not good for layering
actually its very disappointing
nothing seems to not make this go on nicely
there is not a whole lot in the small container
the concept sounds so great
it was a nice consistency
this product does feel great under the eyes
it feels good when applied
it definitely isn't doing much
this one was so disappointing that i'm going to
it was an okay product.
i feel that it does a good job
maybe that is the "bright" part
in what way is this "instant" ?
this product feels good on the skin
the only good thing is it felt cool under the eyes
every little bit helps
the rolling does not feel pleasant.
while this products feels great going on with the roller balls
it feels nice going on
it wasn't the best product out there
this definitely provides a refreshing
there is nothing bad about it
it just sits there
very dry, and nothing works.
the best thing i can say about this product is the packaging is beautiful
this is a good product.
it works much better.
this felt nice going on
the quality is great
a little goes a long way
that being said...the packaging is horrible!
i like the way this goes on very smoothly
the cream feels great
i hope this helps!
it was a pretty decent amount
good for winter but definitely not summer.
too much comes out
it goes on nicely.
my eye area does look better
the only thing is
but this is very frustrating!!!
even if this was the best stuff on earth
it is a good mosturizer for eyes
the first bit that comes out is hard
the first bit to come out is hard
it was great for everything else
the product is really wonderful
the oil of this product is wonderful .
felt that this would be a good fit for me
it feels very nice when you put it on
a little goes a long way
the consistency is nice
pros: a little of this lightweight cream goes a long way
it felt very luxurious going on
it was a big waste of money for me.
it is great product
meants that's it is not working for me
it was a good call!
and the box is really tricky to handle too.
feels great on the skin
it would be great
spending well over $100 on this is ridiculous
still happy with it
sometimes it gives me a headache
a little bit goes a long way.
it gives me a headache
i mean it is a amazing product
i think this product does wonders because it is water based
it feels nice on the skin
the best thing about this product is the way your face feels right after it sinks in -- smooth
it also goes on great under make up.
a big issue for me
for me this is a big
the product feels great on the face
so a product like this is exciting.
here's what is good about it: it might work a little bit
although it does feel nice
it does have a nice consistency
it does feel nice on my skin
it is always a good quality
she was very helpful
this has done nothing
perricone does make good products
this seems to work nicely
as it has done absolutely nothing for me
it was not a good experience for me
was very excited to try it since the full product is extremely expensive
it goes really quick too
like the way it goes on.
the product does feel good
feels good as you put is on your skin
it did a great job
not in a good way
it does spread very well
this product is nice and feels good.
algenist is probably great for most
it has a very different "feel" to it.
this seemed like a good fit
the consistency is totally different.
he really likes the firming
it never gives any added film
i love that it plays nice with my primer
this product is okay.
the only thing it does for me in smooth my under eye area
it goes on nicely
the pros: a little goes a long way
this felt nice on application
but still good products.
the consistency is nice
the product does go on nicely
this "instant firm" product sounds too good to be true because it is
so far so good
too bad, because this stuff works!
so this product really works
really my review is 1.5 stars.
this product is terrible
this one was very disappointing
it is absolutely perfect
it seems to make it worse
it definitely tightens, that's for sure.
definitely need to work to get this product right
it makes me look absolutely awful
not in a good way
this product is terrible.
this product does what is says however
sephora gets 10 stars for their easy returns
it is always the same
alone this product is great
this stuff works amazingly well.
it creates this awful texture that looks really bad
nice concept but in real life its a fail.
for the most part, this is okay.
what was once fantastic is now a horror
a little bit of the product goes a long way
to be honest i feel like it almost emphasizes the pores more
it worked for a bit
it seems to smooth things out
i really like how silky this product is.
feels like good quality
this product is nice
it gets the job done
it gets a no from me
this product is really thick
a good product but not great.
this was wonderful for me at first.
does an okay job cleansing
it was really difficult to get off of my skin
t's hard for me to find something that perfectly works
this was too much
a little bit goes a long way
it is very heavy
this caused me skin to dry out- it was horrible- at first it looks great
it is a little too strong for my liking
this one definitely isn't for me
my face is pretty small]
very lightweight to the point of not really moisturising
then this is probably a decent product
lingers long after application which is sad considering the product does have a nice consistancy
it does apply nicely
it definitely did a great job with my combination skin
how smooth it feels going on
there really is nothing special about it
it is overall very ineffective at doing what it is actually supposed to do--moisturize
i will give it one very good perk
definitely not for everyone
this has helped a little
and a little bit goes a long way.
am always searching for something that works
i've given this cream a very good chance
it is very long lasting
that tends to get pretty dry and this helps.
the good news is that a little goes a long way with this product
i feel like this has done absolutely nothing for my eye area at all
it is very comforting
it is very comforting
not in a scary way, like in a "it's working" way.
can feel it a little bit
overall i felt it was a waste of money.
every morning there is a hard piece that comes out with the product that will not absorb
not really sure how well this worked at all
is a nice consistency for application
is that it works best on mature skin
which is why it gets 2 stars
make up goes on smoothly
nothing special about the product
too bad since it was a good deal.
i feel like this is just a waste of time
this eye cream definitely felt great going on
this one seems perfectly fine
gross.so the experience wasn't great.
it seems to work better with it
at first it seemed really nice
it was also a weird consistency
which is a bad thing for me
it feels really nice to rub in
which seems to work as well
it didn't make me break out which is good because my face reacts poorly to some products
just makes it worse
it makes sense it broke me out.
although the concept for this product is good
said so many nice things about it
it is a good consistency
it is very nice
particularly the three little wonders
a little bit goes a long way.
this product feels nice when applying
i do not feel that this eye cream truly delivers results
which is a deal breaker for me
so, a little goes a long way.
which is working out great
the product itself is nice
although is still a great cream
i've used up the whole thing
which is not intolerable if something works really well
it works pretty well
the consistency is so sticky it feels gross
this feels amazing on my skin
"way too rough for me
this still very good and works on some people.
i think the product itself is good.
not great, just good.
it feels nice on the skin
this was the only thing that i added to my routine
if gives me better results
is still there a little
as it is for me
feels nice going on
need something a bit richer
pretty disappointed considering the other great reviews
it also stung like crazy pretty much every time i used it
not very much needed, which is good.
this product feels nice
it feels mouistuzing at first
this feels so great as you're putting it on
the new formula doesn't work for me
the film feeling was awful.
that describes it best
unfortunately not in a good way
this stuff is terrible
which is a first for me
it definitely took of a good bit of my makeup
nothing exciting enough to splurge on such a high end product though
the science behind the product sounds good
it's pretty much the same experience.
this is bad all around
i like the formula enough…feels good
it made my skin look nice in general.
it has amazing reviews from so many
it's supposed to be one of the best of the best!
it felt lovely going on
it felt great going on
that's about it for the positives.
i like that one very much
as it is very light
the worst part for me is that my skin actually looks courser
this is a huge disappointment
its a little lightweight for me personally
it goes on nicely
it feels good going on
just a little too much so
this stuff is nice
is definitely not a "mask
didn't see any amazing "vitalization" to make it worthwhile
feels good going on
not really.. my skin looks the same.
seems to work nice in my t zone
still i'm quite disappointed by this product
also, it makes me break out a little bit.
it makes my skill feel really greasy which is new because not a lot makes my skin feel that way
the hype of this product is a little much
didnt do amazing things for my skin
the packaging was wonderful
feels great on my skin
the product itself is good for a quick clean.
the water itself is okay
it worked quite well
this is certainly a nice enough
this one was quite strong for me
an ok product all in all, though not impressive.
consistency wise not really my favorite
i do feel it does a good job with dark circles
it is very refreshing when i put it on
has a better feel overall
really just added anothrr issue for me
it does a decent job hiding eyebags
in my opinion this eye cream feels wonderful.
this was not good for me
this is way too harsh.
i do like that it builds up a nice lather.
if that makes sense
a little goes a long way with this product.
it definitely got all the dirt
this is the first time that a product reacts so terribly on my skin
it does clean well
for me, it was just a nice in shower experience.
it does a good job of cleansing
as far as feeling goes
this was very disappointing.
this stuff is really strong.
the bottle seems really small
the bottle is pretty small
when you first put it on it stings a little which seems like a good sign
it does seem to work pretty well
it was nice to try it
this works pretty well
too much product comes out
my skin looked great in the beginning
feels like it sits on the skin as opposed to sinking in like the ginzing does
it was just too much for my skin type
felt nice on application
which is perfect for me since i'm only 24
it does go on very smooth
it goes on smoothly
my favorite youtuber said good things about this product
the cream fits me with barely any breakout.
it was extremely okay.
makes me so sad to have to give it up because otherwise it was a good product :
this cream is not amazing
it is nothing special
at first it feels fine
everything feels much greater now
while this does have a nice consistency
heard such great things about it
unfortunately, doesn't work well with my skin
well it is a good cream
another star because although it worked really well
this made me breakout
does a decent cleansing job
maybe a good fit for done, but not for me.
like it much better
this is an okay mask.
i didn't expect it to be so horrible due to the pretty good rating it has
it seems like a really nice product
this mask is alright
it does seem like it works as my skin always feels a little better after using it
it was very easy to apply
it's not as great as i'd hoped.
this mask has never worked well for me
the next face also felt a little weird
the cream does feel nice
i really wanted to like this eye cream because the price was nice
it felt great to put on
a little bit seems to go a long way for the price
it worked really well for a while
it seemed to be pretty good
i really wish sephora would bring back clear days ahead because that stuff is amazing
a little goes a long way.
it did well as far as cleaning goes
overall the product is just okay.
which is not good
the product description was too good to be true.
i'd say this is pretty good for fairly dry to combo skin
how it works on skin
it felt very good while it was on
the mask feels good when applied
it did work pretty well on my skin
it felt great on
i think it is good
it seems to do the opposite for me
this definitely absorbs quickly right when you put it on
it goes on easily
that worked better for me
it feels great on the skin
i do feel a bit tight after putting this on
oil-free part is great
however, it made me break out pretty terribly.
works well under make-up.
the consistency is quite sheer
not very creamy which is really nice for day time
fresh which is nice
although it feels nice
it has a nice cooling feel
it feels like it's doing something
seemed like it maybe helped to firm my skin a bit?
i got two generous uses out of the little 0
its feeling on skin is incredible
feels nice while you have it on
while this mask felt quite nice
there wasn't anything really great about this product
however, it is horrible for combination skin!
this is a very light
it was simply a decent
overall, this product just isn't for me.
it seems like there is hardly any product in the jar
was not great under make up
this product was a good one for me
this gel is very nice.
it also has a nice tingling when you apply it which feels great
just too strong for my face
but its sad that it doesnt last long .
have been very impressed with the way it works with my bare minerals foundation as a primer
found something much much better
it feels great going on
the only thing that seems to work for me during the winter
it feels good putting it on
this stuff does not look good underneath foundation at all
this was just too much for me
just totally not a comfortable situation
this is definitely not it.
it really is quite heavy
this feels extremely think and gross for hours.
it sits on top and you look really oily.
as always sephora is awesome about exchanging
it almost feels like there is a lot of product on my skin
sometimes nothing…i definitely don’t like this new bottle
the pump doesn't work very well as far as steadiness
it feels nice going on
it goes on easily
perhaps this is better for very young skin
spent a lot of money hoping for a good product.
this stuff worked great at first.
works great as a primer
this worked perfectly fine
i felt like it was doing a great job at restoring some moisture
the terrible part is
t will last quite a while good thing as it is pricey
though it felt nice going on
although it goes on nicely
all of his other products have done amazing things for my aging skin
thank you sephora for your fantastic return policy
assumed it was doing something good
nothing fantastic about this soap.
it seemed to work really well for my skin
this was the only new thing
this product feels really good when being applied
the warming effect it creates is also a really nice touch
is not the best
it really only feels bright
the oil felt amazing on
feels very nice going onto the skin
- i was amazed at the moment applying this cream- it was so smooth
this is a great product
feels wonderful on the skin soon after applying
that's all its really been good for
so far this cream is just so-so
it is not as fabulous as others have said
as it is very heavy
this is very upsetting after reading some great reviews
it has done nothing for me
it is definitely not a product for me.
there is just way too much fragrance in this.
sadly this is the second korres product that just doesn't work for me
otherwise seems to work fine
this product feels good going on
so far so good
a little goes a long way.
this hasn't really done what it claimed
this feels nice on the skin
it absorbs really good
not as great of a product
i know that sephora takes returns
this goes on fine
this product is awful in so many ways.
it was far too strong for me
it felt really nice on my face
this is very overpowering
it goes on nice
this one is a little too strong
there is something different about this formula which makes my skin unhappy
i wanted to like this because it goes on so smooth
this one is top notch in my book
the big tub makes so much more sense.
it really is the best.
it works fantastic with my foreo
seems great for other skin types
most importantly, it hurts your eyes.. .a lot.
so was really surprised how bad this is
it seems it is not for everyone
it just takes too long
it also feels tight
it felt nice at first
maybe it was a bad reaction to what flower is in it
sounded great seemed to look great when she put it on one h
this was a terrible product in my opinion
a little goes a long way so even though the bottle is so small
it is fun to use though.
it is a lot of hype- not worth it.
while it feels good going on
this is a wonderful product
i wish it worked well under makeup because it really gives my skin a smoother look
unwrinkle eye is great though {:>
this was really a waste of money.
feels good going on
the way it feels on your skin is strange
this product stinks worse than any of his products i've ever used
this is a wonderful product
the product itself is terrific
this one is just a little too rich for my skin
just to chance things up
sheer transformation worked beautifully for me
i like the sheer transformation much better!
althought it didn't work for my face the only good thing about this moisturizer is that it looked good under my makeup
that one seemed really nice
which is very unusual for me
a little goes a long way
it feels nice enough on the skin
the over all product worked quite well
it feels nice on the skin
i like this because it is very calming
it is awfully strong
the make up person helping me said it was amazing
for one thing, the packaging is terrible.
the pump is awful
this is definitely not it
the bottle really small for $$$ then it is really light
it definitely helps significantly
it does a decent job
are not so nice
it feels great when i apply it
not quite as good
it feels nice to use
it feels good right after i apply it
the consistency is hard to work with
it goes on nicely
this feels nice going on
'm always on the hunt for some good products to give me under eyes a little tlc
warning: does absolutely nothing for dark circles
the ingredient list looked pretty good
this is a fun product to put on
is that there is too little product
the salesperson said it'd work wonders on dark circles too
while this product feels nice
thought this was perfect
this product feels cool is easy to use
it is an absolute regret
it works like it says
definitely not for winter.
really disappointed since the cleanser is so nice
this feels nice going on
because the texture was a deal breaker for me
that this is a good mask
i agree; this mask is nothing special.
there's nothing remarkable about it
this is pretty ordinary
it is an okay product.
how much money i spent this is insanely frustrating
the product feels great on my skin
whatever it is, it is too strong for my nose.
this is better for combo
great things about this oil
i perfect something that absorbs better.
not in a bad way though it made my makeup look nice
not that amazing but seems potent enough.
i wanted something that makes my skin better overall
this product made me breakout.
my skin looks exactly the same
this product does work for a lot of people
went back to the tlc serum because it did/does great things for my skin
it seems to help a little
seemed to be about great things
as for it doing the job it's meant for
almost feels like you're just moving around some product
this was heartbreaking to find on an important day especially after finally establishing clear skin
'm almost done with this whole bottle which i use every night with my clarisonic
looks better than it ever has
am pretty sure it is effective
this no good for me
this product does feel quite wonderful when you use it
at least it feels good
i think the smile lines are a bit too deep for this to truly work
my foundation looked awful
it is nice under make-up
it does feel good going on
saw some good reviews here
the serum is good, but this does nothing.
this is such a gentle spot treatment it feels like nothing
it really just feels like an oil-free
my skin is finally looking good
in the winter it is not good
the product is definitely 5 star
it felt really smooth going on
overall it wasn't really worth the $40 for me
too much product comes out of this as well because the opening is too large
only good thing is that it made my face really soft
just didn't work very well for my skin type.
the product seems to be working
you need very little and it is very thin.
but it is indeed a 5 star product.
after having decent skin all my life
it kind of works as a primer too
i like the consistency of this product a lot
this is definitely not the product.
this new version is not great.
this is a pretty good solution to have
this one is okay
this stuff takes forever to work
i think it is pleasant
the product itself feels cooling as you put it on
it would be nice for a man.
hopefully it works better
this works pretty well for the price
you will think is product is not good
i like how cool it feels
this one actually stays in place
the feel of the mask is nice, just no results.
although it felt nice
seems to work fairly well
it is very refreshing
this mask was very disappointing.
it worked a little bit
super disappointing because it has such great reviews
nothing seems to work for me
i read reslly great reviews about how well thus product worked
the only thing that works is my skin a little bit brighter
the former product was fantastic
this once fantastic product is now a me to product
this product was nothing special
its nothing really special
it goes on nicely and mosturizes ok.
the foundation doesn't quite stick to it
basically where your face moves the most
i like the 3-step
it makes me breakout too
the whole tube thing makes no sense to me
i read so many positive reviews for this which makes it all the more disappointing that it was awful
it was definitely lightweight
a little goes a long way
this feels great going on
which is sad because i had high hopes for this product
it makes it so much worse
i still have a whole big 3
it works so good
a little goes a long way
possibly because it goes bad quite quickly?
it also adds some pretty intense shine
it is definitely not
this is not good on my skin.
it is so strong
this oil is good but i was not wowed by it.
the oil itself works great
it was a bit of a weird situation for a mask
this was way too harsh
is it as amazing as all the reviewers?
there wasn't a huge long term benefit
this one was extremely disappointing
this is a so-so product for me.
not sure that it would be enjoyable for everyone
this one is nice when i'm just feeling in the food for mask that feels nice at the end
my experience probably was not typical
the way it applies was very nice
i like that a bit better
works just as well
which is huge since i have very fair
yeah,well it makes your skin feel good.
it feels like it is very heavy
not good for combo skin
so far so good
very nice for summer
my forehead is generally pretty clear so that really upset me
i just feel like some of it is always sitting on my skin
kind of just sits on your face
i also felt like it gave me little bumps
this is exactly that.
it also sinks in very well.
product is expensive and has not worked for me.
it has done absolutely nothing for my dark circles
it feels nice going on
it does feel cool
my circles look exactly the same
i've used all about eyes which worked great
this one is just another disappointment
and worst thing i've bought so far.
it truly is a disappointing product
it goes on smoothly
was disappointed in nearly every aspect
the product says it takes 12 weeks to fully work
a little goes a long way
the bottle is huge so there is a lot of product for the money
beyond 5 stars for me forever
now i'm not quite sure
i think this is a nice product
i can deal with a tiny breakout while it soothes the most epic breakout i have ever experienced
if that makes sense
why this product got so many great reviews
but after one, nothing exciting.
my skin looked amazing next day
it is completely different
i gave this product a good try.
this is nothing special at all.
a little goes a long way
to me this cream is really average
nothing has ever worked
definitely not for mature
it is good but not great
the product seems good
the only good thing i can say about it is that it smells good
it is a nice product
it certainly feels good
it works much better
unfortunately it didnt work for me
it does absolutely nothing as far as fine lines
although the product seems to work.
worked just as well
this product did absolutely nothing for my dark circles
lesson learnt the hard way.
it didn't do a whole lot in the way of brightening
and a very little goes a long way.
maybe this takes longer
it says that it is good for combination
the only thing i really like about this is the price
everything else about is pretty decent.
it feels very refreshing once you put it on
this definitely wasn't the one
not an amazing product for sure:/
good, just very basic.
this product is okay.
is nothing too special
it was very lightweight which was great
i gave it a good 4 weeks to make sure it wasn't just a strange skin bought
feels great going on
the pump was nice to use
this made me breakout like crazy!
it feels nice on the skin
this is not great
this was just way too heavy
it really is to bad
i think it is a great product
thankful for sephora's great return policy!
this is completely ridiculous despite everything else
it actually doesn't work very well
it makes me break out a lot!
the pump is terrible
i will tell you that the jar it comes in is extremely wasteful
nothing exciting happened unfortunately.
my philosophy has always been that if it works
i feel that products need quite a bit of time to really work
just hasn't worked for me.
pretty surprising for me
this worked really well
the best part of this product is what it doesn't have it in
it goes on very patchy
it had kind of a healthy glow going on
as for the product itself it was okay.
the only good thing i like about this product is
a little goes a long way, literally.
is just awkward overall
a little seems to go a long way
a little goes a long way
puts on way too much
so far ok overall, nothing special.
it seems has worked for others
the fact that a little product goes a long way
it has left me with great looking skin
the product itself is really light
goes on really smooth
will definetly look forward to how it works when the weather is not so hot
i like the way this product feels
it bothers me that this product has such a good review
it is nothing special.
this really made my skin look bad
it was a chore to try
a little goes a long way
it does feel very good on your skin
feels great at first
it goes on lightly and smoothly.
a little bit goes a long way
it seems like there is still plenty left
the packaging is very nice
for quite awhile now
this is truly just for name.
it has done nothing
this one was awful
goes on very smoothly
nothing terrible … but not ideal, either.
so probably nothing is going to look very dramatic
it was really unpleasant for me
with sephora's awesome return policy
although it feels great
personally everyone's experience is different
this was beyond horrible
i really think this is a dangerous product in every way
was excited to try this as it has great reviews.
this stuff made me breakout.
this worked well for me
it feels super nice
was really hoping for the best
feel are a big thing to me
it also made my skin feel really really oil with this on
virtually everything makes it sting
i think this cream seems like it would be great
this stuff makes my face feel really smooth
a little goes a long way
this stuff would be great for you
works as a great primer
one positive was it was very easy
works all day long
a little goes a long way so it is cost effective.
a couple drops goes a long way
it makes my skin feel great
this is a pretty good face oil
one is very bad
this was just too heavy for me
bummer because the price point is pretty good for the size
probably works great for other people
this one is horrible
like it got the job done
so this is way too heavy for me.
t really disappoints me that this product caused a breakout
the only reason why i gave this product 2 stars is because it did moisturize my skin pretty good
it feels great on my face
it makes my skin look really bad
this is very light
some days this works really well with my combination skin
it was great before that
my skin looks great until it sinks in
maybe its just my body chemistry
i don't feel like this product absorbs very well
because something is better than nothing
and that is where this cream comes into play.
everything is different for everyone
guess my mission continues
overall, it was a disappointing experience.
the reason for two stars is that my skin felt so good to the touch
still the same thing
it feels nice going on
this was really disappointing.
this stuff seems to work.
clearly too strong for me.
this is a nice feeling
it was a lot of money.
a little goes a long way
it has done nothing for me
given the many amazing reviews
really wanted to see how well this product works
it feels like nothing comes out half the time
night like it says to
there is a lot of product
i will say it goes on nicely
this product seemed great at first
now my face looks very bad
this cream is absolutely awful
it feels quite tight
it goes on smoothly
the product feels good
i love how light weight this product goes on
this is still a lovely product i just save it for the days i plan on wearing nothing
pretty minor but definitely there fine lines.
it is just so-
it seemed to be doing something
but the reality is not impressive.
picked this stuff up again twice to make sure it was this stuff doing it
it seems that every time i start to use this amazing product
i'd say this is good product
i feel like i'm doing something wrong based on all of the positive reviews
it works well enough
which works well enough
nothing special at all
it hasn't done a single thing for my eyes
it feels lovely going on
sephora is amazing with returns
i just finished the whole thing
a little goes a long way
very average for me
this is a very good choice
for a product that does maybe a bit more for my personal beauty needs
it has done absolutely nothing
it is a bit expensive which is definitely a negative
it is a very big hassle to deal with
like always it worked wonders at the beginning
i like how it feels.
this is not a miracle product
a little goes a long way
it has done absolutely nothing to my under eye area
this product has a lot of great reviews on how it really works or changed one's eye area
it is true that a little goes a long way.
a little goes a long way
it works very well.
unfortunately this has not done a lot for my skin
2 stars only because it is 90% natural
it feels like a dream
it hasn't done a whole lot of justice there either
something is wrong with the new formula
this product doesn't work as well in every way.
this is a wonderful product.
for young skin it was great
goes a long way-- the sample last me forever
a little goes a long way
definitely not a product for me
this product was a real disappointment
it goes on rich
while this is nice
maybe i'm just sensitive to it... good luck :)
which is a shame since clinique has such a good reputation
was not vibrant or pretty
it was really intense for me
the product goes a long way
felt exactly the same.
i think that this is too much for my 18 year old skin
have so thing to look forward to
this stuff should be real amazing
so this was a real disappointment
this is just not a good product
my skin was doing so so great
it felt nice at first
it works so well
is extremely lightweight which is not a bad thing for those who like that
got some ole henricksen products which work much better for me
this product was not good
it took a very long time for my skin to improve.
terrible experience zero stars
it doesn't do that great deal of a magic
moisture-wise it was good but not great.
again, a solid so-so.
a little too lightweight for my needs
i felt this was important to share
i think this product got a lot of buzz after nikkietutorials recommended it
it seems nifty at first
feel like i'm getting my money's worth
it would be perfect
it absorbs pretty good for an oil.
it absorbed really well
that oil is really amazing
this one is okay
the only good thing about this cleanser is the tiny bit that is needed
also the gel is a little bit hard to push
it is an okay product.
this is definitely not my favorite
feels so nice on the skin
so the product seems to go pretty quickly
overall pretty pleased with product
which was nice to apply
although that's not a difficult task to achieve for me
so this does make my skin feel nice
also feels nice on the skin
it gets the job done
it works well though
which is amazing for your skin
this has done nothing for my under eyes.
this is just awful
this product goes on very nice
the worst thing was
the eyecream feels very nice
agree with the reviewer who said this just sits on top of the skin
this has a great push pump
this stuff is out of control
too bad because it could be nice.
it goes way to quickly
i like the way it feels on my skin
i really had high hopes for this primer after reading a ton of great reviews
initially everything would look great
primer goes on nicely
this seems to make me really oily
this one is alright
which wasn't the best feeling
this is no good
although it does feel great as a primer on your skin
it goes on smoothly
it goes on light
this was too much for me
the product itself seems to work fine
very frustrating to deal with
not impressed for how much the product is.
its not very bad
i think the whole promotion was a bit exaggerating
this product is very much okay.
this one really puts me off
it worked well with my skin
the product itself works great as well.
when i wear it my skin feels amazing the next day
not a very good one
it was not a good choice
it had great reviews
i heard a lot of good reviews on how it treats acne
was hoping to enjoy this
a little goes a long way
it is definitely not a relaxing experience.
all i got from it was a lot of bumps
i think the product is good
definitely a pass for me.
this is an excellent product, no question!
this is a horrible product
after reading great reviews for this product i had really high hopes
it comes off really thick
it hasn't really done much for my face
a little bit goes a long way.
i would expect great results combined with an awesome application experience
it really hasn't worked for me
nice but not amazing.
it feels good going on.
it serves as a pretty good primer for my foundation
seems to work very well for others
paula's choice is just as good
it has not done much
it does feel good on my skin though
really wanted to like this product as it makes my skin feel really soft
it is light which is nice
it is winter here
pros: the actual product is really good.
this product feels good
honestly it is a very small amount for what it is
the consistency was weird
the first time i used it my skin felt so nice
was somewhat excited to try a new mask
nothing really remarkable about it
it is a fairly nice mask ,but not for the money.
this mask is good
it has an interesting light
this works just fine to lightly resurface-nothing extraordinary
natural things take time
not the kind that gives me a headache thankfully
it does feel good on my skin
this is not a good product.
the spread of the product is not very good at all
it just sort of sits on my skin.
having said that, the product absolutely stinks.
my skin looks exactly the same
the pump is terrible
it was that disappointing
that isn't surprising since it has rough pieces in it
for what it is
this just didnt work for me
the product is okay
the only thing i like about it is the texture
like it says in my title nothing special
overall, this seems to be a fabulous product!
the pump is terrible
this serum was way too strong
the result is nice
it is very strong
it is so strong
it is a nice product
because it is so awful
this maybe a great product
not in the nice
this product sounded amazing
it seemed to have a nice cooling
feels nice going on
it seemed to work for me.
this is the only new thing i've added
does feel refreshing though.
this product feels nice
it feels nice when using it
actually very disappointing as the line seems such a great idea
as i like how it makes my skin feel
seems like it works for some, but not for me.
everyone is different so this is just my experience
so sad to return as i like the consistency of the product
this serum is really not for everyone.
so maybe this product is too much for me right now
not a good product for me
i do think it really varies
clearly it does good things for some people.
my big problem with the product is that it is dry
like the essence water that shiseido makes
i wanted to love it just because it does feel really nice on the skin plus it smells so nice too
third, in the winter, this does nothing for me.
it was really this product
it really wasn't a good feeling for me
which was perfectly fine
used the entire thing: it hasn't done anything for my dark circles
a little goes a long way
at first this product worked very well
i try different skin care this is a good product.
doesn't work very well
it is not good a mask
it is just bad.
it works great for my skin
this wasn't much better.
for my skin it has worked pretty good
this product really helps when i am having a breakout
it actually works really well on my body.
this oil is as it says
this was really bad
it definitely did not work out very well
it seems like too much work
which i feel like defeats the purpose of it
it works alright, better than my wipes.
was really keen to try it
it leaves behind this incredibly sticky film
title says it all.
this one is nothing really special
i will say it feels very nice on the face
it takes off foundation
gets off most of the stuff
it's the only product that has ever done this to me
i gave the product three stars because it actually works really nice as a toner
this is an okay product.
i got this in 'the great cleanse'
this product used to be amazing
it is not a bad product
the feel of the mask was great
it is really nice
not very moisturising especially brings out spots
it gets the job done
sephora was wonderful about my returning it
which is a lot for me
just not the greatest
its not totally horrendous
has done little for my fine lines
this goes on nice
this one absorbs pretty well
it has done nothing
also think it was definitely breaking me out.
does feel nice on the skin
it takes a lot for me not to like a skincare product
i guess the good thing about it is the product itself lasts a long time
is definietly just part of a routine
the consistency is nice
it did feel very nice
it has a scent that is far too strong for my liking however
my skin gets pretty oily during summer so this was perfect in terms of consistency
not in a bad way
it is so horrible for my skin.
i gave this a good
which is awesome sephora has a great return policy
this product seems to work
no, it really is that bad.
this was just awful
these worked pretty well at first
it's never a good sign when my skin gets all tight like this
i liked this cleanser in that it did a really good job of getting all my makeup off
the product right out of the jar feels like it has very
this felt all right
my skin feels great
it was very gritty
eve lom makes seriously great products
although this is a good cleanser it is not for everyone
this makes my skin feel absolutely perfect
at first i thought it worked great
it is not a miracle product for me
a little bit goes a long way.
also this was just too thick and for nothing.
what is in this product??
a little goes a long way
classy company that makes good products
which was extremely disappointing
so far it is looking good.
i think my skin looks a little better around my eyes
this is a really good product
it has been working great
not tight in a good way either
the only thing good about this is the spf.
how this has good reviews
was very happy with it
this stuff was just okay.
it goes on great
what the big hoopla is about this product
this is my first
almost unbelievable since i'm very familiar with skin care ingredients
now feels like it is burning
looks like this isn't the right product for me.
it takes a lot to break out my skin
what it does is make a really good base for your make-up
my make-up goes on flawless
2 stars for how little it does for the extremely high price
and a little goes a long way.
just another hype product that was a waste of my time
found it really helps a lot
i like this product very much
it better work really
this has been great for balancing my skin out
this might be great for adding a bit of help without overdoing it
it is a nice mask
putting this on was just really 'meh
it felt nice going on
it does make a difference in how my skin feels.
that being said, this mask is pretty ok.
the most terrible thing is this makes me can't open my eyes
it would be nice for someone who enjoys a simple
relaxing mask just for the fun of it
this is kind of a strange product.
one thing this is good for
i gave it 3 stars because it is a good product just not the right one for me
it feels very pleasant upon application
my skin looks great when i use it
it sounds like it works for a lot of other people
i think this product is really effective for some
it's worked well for me
some other really good ingredients
is that i really do enjoy the consistency
i wanted it so badly to work because of the good reviews
my skin got so much better
this is a wonderful product that truly brings the moisture without the heavy feeling
it just felt like...well...water?
this product is lightweight and feels nice.
what an awful disappointed this cream is.
i am sure that this product is really good for the skin
it has great reviews
its a great product, just not for me.
it seems to work just as well as a primer
this product feels fabulous on my skin
i will say a little goes a long way with this cleanser
this entire line makes me break out as well
not in the good way
this stuff is too oilly for me
it goes on so nicely
i finished the whole thing
it was not a pleasant experience.
it is a very nice day cream.
the reviews seemed amazing.
every morning when i look in the mirror i'm impressed with how well it works
great results so far
no but it does feel super nice on the skin.
she said this was perfect for the
does everything it boasts about
be careful as i got pretty bad reaction from this product
feels like it once it is applied
it almost feels like i just used a really thick primer
only redemption is it looks really nice under foundation
this made me breakout.
it was working very well
it was pretty good
not in the good way
it is very thick so seems like it would last a long time
it is a really cool concept
comes off quite easily
in no means was anything spectacular
overall not a huge fan.
it works well too
really wanted to like this one because price-wise it was great for my wallet
wasn't especially impressed with it one way or another
this seriously gets just about everything off.
this product is terrible.
my skin looks / feels no better than before i started using this product
a little goes a long way.
i'll start by saying this mask feels great on the skin
it is definitely possible i layered too much on
it does its job
it is nothing special.
tsubaki oil is great, this not so much.
great way to ruin your skin in the long run
am happy with how it performs in our very dry climate
definitely a no for me.
almost done with it
a little goes on long way
water which is very frustrating
very few products really "do" it for me
i really like the consistency of this cream
the good part is that it goes well under make-up
is there such thing as too much eye cream?
this product definitely wasn't for me.
i felt this did exactly the same thing with a thicker consistency
while the product is nice
here are my takes so far:
it does have a nice smooth finish
it works perfectly like that
it had a nice light
the guy at sephora said it was part gel part cream
the feel was nice
this thing is meant to help fine lines
would be a nice consistency as an evening cream.
the consistency was sort of surprising to me
works great on skin
good skin care basically comes from a good diet.
this product does absolutely nothing for my skin
another cream has done this to me as well.
this was definitely disappointing
thus it gives me breakout
it still gives me breakout
feels wonderful on my skin
it looks good so far
i give it 3 stars because it feels very nice on my skin
it felt good while applying
considering that my clinique works even better for me/ lasts longer
it is quite hard to do so
it creates more of a mess than it helps
is incredibly difficult to spread on
at a very tiring cost
it was really just fun to peel
is overall a good product.
the first two uses impressed me
this product is probably great
but for me, it was at best mediocre.
this mask is nothing special
overall not bad since it does feel very refreshing
it just wasn't a good experience first time
it is certainly fun to use
one thing i will applaud it for is that the mask is non-irritating
obviously it seems to work for some people's skin--just not mine
the fabulous associate who helped find the right product after this
it goes on pretty thin
this is a good mask
a little goes a long way
felt it wasn't strong enough
it deserves a few stars for that alone.
it can create some weird film in my eyes
it looks really pretty
it gets the job done, nothing more.
i wanted to like this because it seemed like it would be great for my skin when it gets really oily in the summer
the first maybe 5 days was very very bright
also breaks me out a little bit
it is a real testament to my love of this product that i didn't return it immediately
this product is fantastic
it is just very strong
i got a terrible breakout
because a little goes a long way
it definitely feels nice going on
it is very expensive for something not outst
a little bit goes a long way
it also stays where you put it.
this is especially nice for me
but this is just....yek.
it definitely kicks it immediately
so my point is everyone is different
obviously different skin type as well
it works for someone
it sounded pretty incredible
feels good in the skin too
it works just as good if not better
the product is great
product is average, nothing great.
this product is not for me
sad part it is though
i wanted to like it because it feels good on the skin
this product goes on like a mask
it was still just good on top of my skin
using it on my hands is nice though.
was nice to try out
it just wasn't a good experience
immediate feel of this product is amazing as usual
this is so weird to me
this cream went on very nicely
just not good at all...
the only good thing about it
gets everything off for the most part
the overall impression is just okay at best
it gets the job done
it feels really gross when putting it on your face because it doesn't feel like a normal oil it feels weird
removes make up pretty well with little product
it was not a pleasant experience
pros: breaks long wear foundation like a dream
this stuff makes me break out so bad
this product has done nothing for me
looks much better on its own
this product does an okay job for some lines
it doesnt quite do what it says when it comes to filling lines
it was an okay product to me.
this primer does absolutely nothing
especially since theres very little of the product in the stick
it seemed to be great
was super excited to give it a try given my porefessional was running low
this primer is definitely not for you
it goes on fairly smoothly
was told this one was great
it is most definitely not!!!
it feels nice applying this product.
a little goes a long way.
this to me is just not great
because this goes so fast.
(it was a bit too strong for my liking.)
this one was really very light
this product i found to really be nothing special
it is overall a good product
there is absolutely no wow factor
in my opinion there is nothing about this lotion that makes it exceptional
feel this one makes claims
amazing by the way
no good for my skin unfortunately
worked so much better
it is a very nice mask
nothing major really happened
it seemed that everybody lived this
the best things about this mask are:
thinking the brightening would be a nice bonus
it gets the job done
has done absolutely nothing for my skin
it has done nothing for me
this stuff actually does a decent job of correcting my dark circles
that means my makeup goes with me
basically what this is
the idea is good.
this is not good
obviously there's not a whole lot in the
so far this is pretty good
it feels great going on, but that's about it.
one is too fair
the idea is cool, execution is a miss
i really was hopeful for this product.
it feels very nice going on.
it sounded so great with all of its claims.
think i'm still in the process of a true
so far it has been a great addition to my makeup routine
i take really good care of my skin already
in my case turns out to be a bit of a disappointment
this product has some nice ingredients
there is nothing spectacular about this product.
brings me to the next point.... $51.
it helps my skin a lot better
the gel says nowhere what it definitely is for
i find the whole product to be a bit deceiving.
how it feels on
was so so so good
not in a good way
it feels really good the cool gel in your face the first minute
why it works so badly
this product was not good for my skin
thought this would be amazing
it is truly all hype
the only thing this product really does is leave your skin extremely soft
a very rare thing for me
so a little bit goes a long way
takes quite a while to get all of the product off
it felt really nice
it seems like great value
like it has good ingredients
a little drop goes a long way
the formula is amazing
though the look it gives is sort of natural
give a natural good look
the foundation feels heavy
the consistency was nice
it was hard to work
this is a good product, not the best.
obviously the name says it all
it feels great on the skin
the only good thing
my skin is pretty good with nothing really to cover up
thought this would be perfect for me
if someone has perfect skin
this is a very easy to apply
i think the "no foundation" foundation works in theory
this worked for me
if it says foundation it is foundation.
i noticed my skin was looking pretty fabulous too
the only reason i am giving it 3 stars is that it only comes in 1 color
i think this is a good light foundation: it blends nicely
is pretty long-lasting
it is as bad as everyone says it is.
this really is as bad as everyone says it is.
just used this product and it is terrible!
it is very light
it is very light
just needs a little bit of cream
how does my skin knows it is an eye cream?
unfortunately this cream is going back
it feels good on
it actually made me feel like the whole area was sticky
this is very comfortable when applied.
it feels nice at the start
too high for what happened to me
again just my experience
i am just so disappointed because fresh has such a great reputation
this stuff is good for wrinkles
the product works when it wants to
i work hard for my money.
the dark spot fix is a huge waste of a lot of money
then it feels better
the title says it all.
the product works very well
imagine it was just the second strip's product that was doing this
the strip works amazing
the second step feels nice
works so much better
the formula was actually good.
it is just terrible.
works exactly the same
this was super disappointing.
such an awful experience.
uncomfortable for a whole day
a little goes a long way
this is a good mask
definitely not a great one
this is a good mask
that was much better for me
the only reason i gave it two stars is because it smells nice
still look like in 20 is important which is why this left me feeling disappointed
this is a wonderful product.
it just feels cool
takes an extremely long time to even set in
the product feels nice
it just becomes a disaster because everything will just ball up
it is a waste of time you putting everything on
that is exactly what it feels like on my eyes.
i think it does not sink into skill well
it is very easy to use
i think it is the gel consistency that doesn't work for me
find that it works much better
at first thought it was great
this eye cream was not at all great
the only good thing is the instant cool feeling
it goes away pretty fast
like how it makes my face feel/look
made it look amazing
which was a little disappointing
this isn't just about the foaminess obviously
this product deserved two stars from me for twofold
it looks pretty much the same
i like this brand and is really great.
just too strong for my face
lingers for a very long time
while i must say that it feels really nice on the skin
this felt fantastic going on
the formula feels nice
it has a lip that makes it hard to get all of the product out
i like how this feels!
it just feels really nice
a little goes a very long way.
which would be fantastic except for one pretty big thing: this isn't a moisturizer
feels nice going on but that's about it.
my whole face just looks terrible
this started out great
one thing good about it is
it was not good not bad
back to philosophy for me.
every other product is great
i like the way it makes my skin feel
this product was not good for me
it takes the fun out of using the oil
not in a good way
got this as a 100 point perk not sure if the product is good
this generally works nicely.
it hurts pretty bad
though it is very pretty
a little goes a long way
this is a very nice cream.
it goes on nice
well this product does just that!
it just seems like a really fast
not in a good way
the product works okay
while it was fun to use once
the thought behind this product seems like a good idea
while the consistency felt very nice on my face
the concentrate does a good job
so this lasts quite a while
it goes on smooth, but then what?
this product does absolutely nothing for my skin.
the only good thing i can say about this serum is that it is a true serum
also, a little goes a very long way.
obviously it works some people
this product is also not very good as a st
a tiny bit goes a long way!
guess it just helped keep my skin the way it was
thus was extremely excited to try this product
like i said it was really nice
not great, not terrible.
this is why i felt my skin is a bit relief
i am giving it a 1 star because this product is not good for my skin at all
it didnt work for me
it feels nice on the skin
this cleaner is a huge miss for me.
so the whole directions seemed interesting.
this is definitely the worst
the reality is a much different story.
it is just okay
for me it wasn't the one that worked
while it felt great
this stuff is not good for sensitive skin at all.
it has a very weird consistency
my experience was this product worked better as a facecream
you really only need a very, very tiny amount.
i think this product is too rich for my skin type
the consistency of the product makes it hard to get out of the container
it does truly work miracles with getting make up
i just feel like the process is a bit involved
the formula feels nice
at first this feels great on the skin
even the tiniest breakout for me has always been incredibly rare
has an interesting consistency
the application of the product feels weird
is this ever a big "
it also made me breakout.
feels great at first
it goes on like oil
this is a pretty good product.
i like the consistency
it is great for make-up
it is a nice consistency
the product itself is not bad
so not a good idea
which is a big bummer for means pretty much a deal breaker
it felt nice putting on
it gives me also breakout
it has such amazing reviews
i feel a little goes a long way
this cream feels nice
it felt really refreshing
it definitely was not
it also doesn't last very long
i found it very disappointing
it is not true
it seems like it is running out very quickly
i think it would be very nice
it made me breakout
from what she said about the cream it sounded great
do feel like this helps "blur" some lines which is so awesome
nothing works for everyone.
once i got the big jar it is really not that great
i've used up the whole thing
the earlier reviews made this product seem so wonderful
sephora was awesome about it
the reason i gave this two stars is it has a really nice clean smell
not exceptional, just okay.
which is actually a good thing for me
it was not very impressive on any front
my skin looks terrible at the moment.
nice to see it actually works for a lot of other women
my skin looks awful right now
what most important is
which is really unbelievably good
this is a really weird product.
this one is really just bad
i've gotten it to a pretty amazing state with my current routine
it felt great at first
feels good to put on
it kind of lays on the top.
it just seems like it takes too many swipes to get the product out
does a fantastic job retaining moisture in your skin as well
is not working for me
it is simply wonderful!
i like that as it feels like real moisturizing is going on there
nothing like a big breakout
the not so fortunate part is that it doesn't sink into my skin
that was a nice surprise.2.
it felt nice going on
this one is awful
so this was definitely a heart break
brought this mask based on all the positive good reviews sadly this did not work for me
this is a good product
'm sure this was the product breaking me out
it was definitely the mask
no its definitely this stuff
while i like the way it feels
way too much for a skin product
it worked much better
certainly not like obvious "work"
i think this is a great product to use.
every "miracle" product does absolutely nothing on me
after going through a good bit of this produxt
enjoy it for the refreshing
this is nothing like it
at first was pleased with how it worked
it is a very great name for a product
that's been a huge lot-- this one made me the most mad
something that actually works
it feels really good when you have it on
the product itself is great
the product is good
was really excited to try out this product as i needed something to clean my pores
the masks are phenomenal!
this is a good actually great for acne when i had my period
plus the pump is terrible.
liked the idea that this is kind of a face
was really hoping this was going to work considering the br
the mask part is good
great that it works for other people
to me, it really is not that pleasant.
he product is lovely.
a lot of product goes a little ways
feels nice when applied
this product is good but not amazing for me.
a little goes a long way
it seems to go a long way,and dry quickly.
so the relief feels nice.
it's pretty disappointing that this has given me no relief with that considering i'm only 22
this is something different
at first it seemed great
it was finally a product that worked wonders for my eyes
a little goes a long way
the product was so nice to use
a little goes a long way
that being said...it's just nothing special.
this stuff is nice
it makes them feel really good
i love the way my skin feels after using the whole tatcha regimen
it worked well on my skin
i did use my whole bottle up so that shows it is a good purchase
the shape of the bottle is not pretty in my opinion
*this oil works differently for everyone
it just sits there.
this oil is just okay.
would never say that this is a bad product--it absorbs into skin really well
was excited to try this as it was designed for both
this was way too strong for my skin
it has done absolutely nothing for my skin.
so that says a lot
this truly was terrible for me
this product is great for anyone who has milia
i might've overlooked this if the product itself worked better for me
it has great reviews on sephora
it feels nice on my skin
it looks really pretty
it was the same thing
it gives a good back scratch, though.
the formula is nice
i really hoped for a miracle product
it is a good start
this of course is just my experience.
at first it felt amazing
really upset because my skin is pretty much ruined for this product
after reading all the great reviews i was hoping it would work great on my oily skin
it just means it doesn't work with my chemistry.
which is a shame because i really like the korres rose line
felt good using it
this product is good
nice package, nice idea but it doesn't work.
this product is terrible.
this was one of those rare leaps of faith
korres is still a great company with great products
wasn't impressed with product at all it is just a gimic
it was from it might work great
the one positive thing i can say is that it makes my skin incredibly soft
it worked great for that along with a really good moisturizer
this thing is a waste of money
i just really have no positives for this.
is very hard to clean out
good thing sephora has a great return policy.
this is all looks
works just as well
this was just terrible for me.
was pretty disappointed to find that this product doesn't make a difference for me at all
the formula is very nice
it felt nice going on
that puts out great skin care
she said that the 'cold' feeling was the product working its magic
it feels nice when you put it on
this is a nice feeling product
is overall a good product
this product is good depuffying the eyes!!!
i think the finish has a lot to do with it
it would not matter how great this product worked
shame on you benefit for putting that much fragrance in a product that goes by the eyes
it makes me look like a ghost
a little goes a long way which is great
this product certainly takes everything off.
but the problem is it takes everything off.
this product is alright.
first off, a little goes a long way!
it does clean quite well
nothing happened that made me consider this product to be irreplaceable
looks like it has a lot
now that is amazing stuff!
it does make my skin feel really nice
bought this product thinking i would see a change in the way my skin looks because its quite tired
then this product is pretty good
this was not good for me
looks like a the hard c
it doesn't spread very well.
it feels nice on the skin
i do feel makes a nice primer
to give you an idea of how smoothing this is
made me feel like i was doing something luxurious for my skin
this mask is perfect for going out to the club
my skin does look good
gives you the same result
the experience was very enjoyable
this mask looks pretty
was really hoping i would see great results
that might be fun
it didn’t make me breakout
the fact that it is gold makes it fun to put on
it lasts pretty long.
said how amazing of this cleansing bar
but it seems not work well for me.
despite me liking the way it works
a little goes a long way
the "all skin types" was amazing
my skin is really stubborn so to find one that really worked was wonderful
it does clean very well
it worked really well
lasts a very long time.
otherwise is product is awesome!
this product was nice
i like the way my face feels after using this product
it is only 3/4 gone
obviously i am going for the complete opposite
well it is very expensive
it feels great when you apply
felt it was a complete waste of money for me
it has great ingredients
this just has not done anything for my dark circles
it was also too strong
this stuff is horrible!
it felt great though putting it on...very soft.
feels nice going on very cooling
it does it well
nothing special, but it is cool.
is also not good
makes my face nice
it has left my whole face incredibly dry
i doubt how much it actually cleans
it takes off my make up well but that's it
big mistake, and big waste of money.
really thought this product was going to improve it at least a little bit
the ingredients in this thing is terrible.
this product seems to be pretty hit or miss
it has a lot of great points though
i think this is a good product
there was nothing super special about this product
it feels nice on.
it feels good going on.
not in an entirely pleasant way
it has a very nice cooling effect
this is not good at all
that is really disappointing
this is definitely great for the summer
the product is not bad but not that good as well.
it was much better
it also feels weird putting it on
it's fine it does the job well
my skin seems to really like it
it does a great job of taking off make up
so far no luck
although it gets off my make-up pretty good
although this oil feels great on the skin
the good in this is not worth the bad.
i think the product is less than impressive.
it is kind of expensive and run out really fast.
find the overall quality fantastic
the breakout was awful
mpressed that it felt really nice
1 star is too much
i got a really bad breakout!!!
this felt so nice
well, that is wrong.
does make skin look nice though
but doesn't last very long.
this stuff is a hard pass for me.
a little goes a long way
unfortunate since the ingredient list seems amazing
it was that bad.
yeah... no way i was keeping this.
if you use it as a cleanser it does a pretty decent job
for the rest of us
this gave me such an unpleasant
the bubbling part may give you the illusion that it’s doing something
feel nice when using it
this thing is like magic with these problems
this one just wasn't great
always get great results
3 starts is just appropriate in my opinion.
it seems like a good product
this is a great product.
$40 is too much for the amount of product you truly get
this product is not bad
of course, this just applies to me.
this stuff is just so amazing
since it seems like nice cream
this product is ok, but nothing amazing.
great product by the way
cream is thick so little goes a long way.
2 stars only because the cream is decent.
it wasn't that great
this product is just okay.
it takes too long to absorb
this is a sad new version for a product that was really good to begin with
this is definitely not an option for my dry
it was also constantly breaking me out so that's always a negative
i really wanted to like this because it comes with a great spf 30
a little goes along way.
gave it two stars because it is really good for dryness
saw it had fairly decent reviews
nothing special about this.
but this is not a winner.
it feels good going on and absorbs well.
the only positive thing it doesn't have any scent which is great
it hasn't really done much for my skin
it doesn't go on very nicely
my skin looks exactly the same
this product isn't that great
it totally made me breakout
this made me totally breakout.
now i'll pay good money for good makeup especially skin care for sure
it is quite nice
it hasn't done much for me
the bottle is basically done
finished a bottle hoping it gives me some what changes for my skin
it was just awful for my skin
so many people said this was amazing so of course i got it
this was a horrible experience
otherwise, this product is good.
this one wasn't the best
so far so good
unfortunately this was nothing
the quality is good
it only gets half the bottle which is i really disappointed about
which was supposed to be part of the fun
it absorbs really fast which was a plus
it is important to share my experience too
this really falls short for me
as a primer, this is just okay.
it feels very similar to the smashbox primer
so this seemed like the perfect formula for getting it in
this stuff is terrible
it goes on smoothly
when i first got it it worked great
the combo of this under foundation just doesn't work
that being said, the wear wasn't very good.
it felt so nice
other than that it actually feels really good
how it feels when i use just a little bit
hopefully it works for some people
felt great going on
it will be perfect
it goes on so smoothly
it goes on nicely
this seemed ideal for me
it goes on nicely
is this product a nice primer?
it just looks amazing my skin doesnt feel cakeky
it gets irritated by this product it seems
which was definitely not my experience
it most certainly is not mattifying
not so good for me
it does not do a very good job at keeping it matte
for me it was kind of
it makes my make goes on patchy
so i just put this on, felt amazing at first!
when first applied it has a wonderful feeling on the skin
one positive is that a very small amount of product goes a long way
it feels good going on
murad works a lot better than this!
the oily part still bothers me
unfortunately this product does the opposite for me
now this is a very nice
little goes a long way.
now it does feel nice
said how amazing it is for my specific issue
this is a good product.
this is a great night cream for me that isn't exactly breaking the bank
this is great for that
it is very light weight which is nice
which becomes awful in the winter
feels like a layer of something else is just on your face
unfortunately this product looks
still use it from time to time when my face feels like it needs a good hydration
i felt like the product was very heavy
it is very heavy and does not absorb well.
a little goes a long way
this is a huge deal breaker for me
i love the way this stuff goes on.
just lays there like some other reviews said
the formula is nice
felt nice going on
it did feel amazing
has been impossible to find a good cream for me
it felt great when i put it on
the firming part is pretty good.
it does not work as described
this product is so disappointing.
it goes on smoothly
finding a good brightening products that's right for my skin is the most difficult thing at all time
it is difficult to get off
this mask was definitely a new experience.
this mask was horrible.
feels really good going onto the skin
doesn't seem like it absorbs very well
it looked absolutely horrible
nothing bad about it just nothing spectacular
feel like it just sits on top of the skin
this product was awful
the face cream is great, but this isn't.
feel like i've given it a fair shot
seems like it just sinks in
this one is alright
it helps my foundation apply smoothly
basically, it gets the job done.
what i do like is it absorbs quite quickly
does feel light as it promises
it was nothing special
does make the skin feel good
it was just okay
now it was pretty much normal
this is the only glamglow product i'm not impressed with
it does a good job cleansing
my skin looks great when i use this
good stuff but a little more hype then result.
worked great with the mask
the pump doesn't work great
was hoping for another great product
i'll start with the good.
when mixed together i felt as though it just messed up the good qualities of the oil
my face is already looking amazing
made it feel really tight
the pump on this one is very awkward
kind of sits on top
hopefully you have better luck with it.
nice feel a little goes along way.
the product begins to ball up if you buff anything on top of it
this product is awful
unfortunately that is the very reason this only gets three stars from me
this is a great product
that my muf foundation doesn't cover very well
the worst part is that it really sits on top of your skin
the consistency is weird
it feels good on
very frustrated overall by this stuff.
the consistency is odd
this is hard to work with.
this stuff works alright.
this seemed to fit the bill perfectly.
otherwise is a great " primer" !
this is a sad exception
there was always some kind of streaky
how it goes on
my skin felt tight, but not in a good way.
the mask was okay, nothing amazing though.
but it ends there.
it was very pleasant
it has great ingredients
that drives me crazy
sadly, this one is going back.
everyone said that this was it
really goes to show you that not everything works for everyone
it not a good or comfortable experience
it obviously wasn't for me.
this product was neither good or bad for me.
this feels a little heavy
it makes a nice night cream since it takes a long time for the skin to absorb it
it feels nice going on
this feels amazing going on
it definitely felt tight
overall it was an alright mask.
this product used to be great.
i suppose this is good for a good deep cleaning
sadly this was a bit too strong for me.
it says it has lots of great stuff in it
this mask is nothing special.
this mask has really great application!
i think its a nice mask
this one sort of feels like it just sits on top of the skin
it made me breakout
my skin is overall pretty good
this is not for everyone
it works very well.
even sephora brand works better for me.
amazing the first time you use it
was so excited to get this as the reviews are great
this is just bad to me
the consistency felt really nice
after looking at the ingredients i was definitely not impressed by this
a little goes a long way
i think it worked well
this one seemed like a perfect fit
a positive is that a little goes a long way -- i've used this everyday for 2 months
maybe for some people it really works
a little goes a long way.
was in need of a good product
it feels very nice when i apply it.
a little goes a long way.
even though it feels really fresh when you put it on
there, i said it.this is fine.
the idea was great as i travel a lot
it worked very well for me
the stick format is a little tricky to work with
this product is pretty gentle
gets the job done though.
the stick idea is interesting
although it seems like a good idea for easy travel
it really is not
i got this cleansing stick because the whole line sounded very intriguing to me
the only nice thing is the stick that you just wind up to get more product
it works much better
'm giving this two stars: good concept
a little goes a long way
the essence is a win
this product is awesome
it is a nice product
it applied nicely, but the finish is so so.
not a good combo for me.
this one just isn't that great
not in a nice way
this looked really appealing
it is definitely this
pass on this whole brand as far as i'm concerned.
breakout like normal every now
it is okay product.
it has done nothing besides make my skin feel smooth after
it definitely is good
a little truly goes a long way
i work really hard at this
your product is great but my skin said no.
it never gives this you know glowing right-after-awesome-mask skin
this was not enjoyable at all
my face is definitely not glowing in any way
now nothing is coming out
the mask feels really good
it was really hard
since i take real good care of it
which is quite nice
it looks beautiful, but feels awful.
so not a great idea as a primer
this one is a bad one
this stuff started out disappointing in the application process
this product is decent.
too bad... it had a very nice consistency.
like the title says
my skin felt better so that's good
one just needs to find the kind that works particular skin
it didn't work very well.
for the price i got 4-5 uses out of the little pack which was great
while it's been working well to mattify
then this is a great product for you
product feels great on your skin.
as a product, this stuff works okay.
for the price it works pretty well
this is just to much for me to take
it's definitely not the greatest
not awful but not great.
immediate gratifying glow, at best.
that's how i got pulled in to trying this because of all of the amazing reviews
was definitely hoping to see some kind of improvement
even though a little goes a long way.
this eye cream does absolutely nothing!
definitely not good for under make up.
this stuff feels great on the skin
hopefully third times a charm.
which i guess means it is working
i just hope it lasts.
constantly just make it too overwhelming
it is a very nice oil
my skin reacts to so many things that i was very hopeful this would help my skin
already my skin feels better
while the consistency is nice
feels amazing on the skin
this product is very disappointing
this is definitely not it
the best thing about this is that it has sun screen in it which i love
which really is better
'm hoping my skin is just adjusting before it works
it made me breakout
especially because i am a huge fan of the philosophy eye retinoid- that stuff works like the prescripts my derm gives me
my skin got from good to very bad
but feels good and didnt break me out.
the product itself is interesting
feels great on the back of your h
it works well, but not great.
this is good, but not great.
this product is fun to put on
this is a very cool product!
it feels great in the skin.
not a good primer for make up!
however, i feel like its pretty intense.
this face cream is only just decent.
so this was a little disappointing
the product does work well
pretty hohum product in my opinion.
feels nice when on
it has a nice consistency
this was really surprising to me as it is supposedly a day cream
it felt nice going on
just that it felt nice on my under eyes
the way it feels
for the price there is much better stuff.
this was just not a good product for me.
it has not done anything for my dark circles
feels good when you put it on
it seemed really great in the store
this is a really lightweight cream that goes on easily
it goes on nicely
it has done nothing
no stars, terrible product!
the cream has a very nice consistency
not in a good way
it was really disappointing.
jart seems to always be good
this is a terrible product.
whoever came up with this formula probably has some sort of resentment toward humanity
works well with my clarisonic
it is a good product
this product is good overall
it really works so well!
the product is amazing.
the bottle that it comes in is terrible
this product deserves five stars.
your skin feels fantastic after a short time using
then too much comes out
i really hope algenist will change the dispenser because the serum itself is great
overall this is good if you're okay with the "film"
the jar itself looks more pretty in person
this is just okay
i actually thought this was a pretty good serum.
maybe this is a godsend for some truly troubled skin types
nothing was on my face-as well no film feeling
terrible in every way!
it feels great on
it is noooothing special at all
while this feels amazing
that is a big deal for me
what little there was
this product is definitely not for me.
which it absolutely has not done
it is very light and almost feels like water.
also a little goes a long way so it does last.
it felt really cool
it is probably a wonderful product for those with combination skin
i like the way it feels
it feels good on
moisturizing is something that can be accomplished for much less money
at first, it felt amazing on my skin.
just feels nice on a face
it's the opposite of "a little bit goes a long way"
not ideal when you need to head to work
no good for me.
it is really heavy
it drives me crazy!
this product is horrible
the consistency is very unusual
this one looked interesting
it first seemed great
almost feels like a light hard mask.
it does ball up really bad
that really says something
it feels a little heavy too on first application
that's not a big deal because it absorbs quickly
at first it felt really nice on my face
it felt very ordinary to me
the consistency was nice
is a good way to matifiying your skin
packaging is very well done
just got this product
hoping it works for me
for awhile this soap worked really well
this product is definitely not for everyone.
it actually made me breakout very badly
this one seemed nice at first
this product just wasn't magic for me
it is so strong
i found the consistency of this product to be a bit too thin to really stay on my face well
the hype is not real
the mask is honestly horrible
seeing so many great reviews
unfortunately it has not worked for me
a little definitely goes a long way
'll definitely finish the product
it isn't the miracle worker everyone seems to have an experience with
it felt really nice on the skin
was really liking how smooth my under eye area felt
saw awesome results as far is it really brightening the under eye area
it definitely moisterizures the area really nicely
a little goes a long way
the main thing which bothers me is when you apply it feels like lotion
specifically with this product the shape makes it challenging to get the last of the product out as it clings to the side
it feels nice when i apply it
i really wanted to like this stuff based on all the good reviews
it was terrible for me
although the gel was good this product wasn't the best :
i think it depends what skin tone you are.
the added glow was not working for me
it was just a very unpleasant experience all around
it has great results for a lot of people
but my bottle was pretty new.
the formula needs to be played with a bit for it to work
it has great ingredients
it gives me the worst breakouts ever
there was nothing really special about this cleanser
looks like it's going to be great!
it was really fun to use
that's about all that made it good for me
it is entirely too strong
i think this is a fantastic product for a younger generation that is just looking to have a good basic face wash
although it worked fine
it feels great on your skin
it is kind of neat
i could really only see this working for a teenager with great
this was fun to apply
this one is pretty good
get this for the fun
it is fun to use
this product is nice
it is over all a nice product
which was really disappointing because the texture is really nice
this product is nothing special unfortunately.
it was fun to put it on
how it makes my skin look
it feels good going on
a little goes a long way
it feels good going on
it is a very nice consistency
this is the only time sephora has disappointed me
my search for a product that fades them even a bit continues
the combo was awesome
it kind of worked so three stars
i hope this helps!
i feel like this product is good for people with very light spots
it has done absolutely nothing
this was a huge waste
just doesnt get the job done!
this stuff worked well, it's very strong.
wasn't great for me at all
know there are a lot of fabulous reviews on here
it's doing its job very well
the oil definitely works
a little bit goes a long way
this product was so bad.
just not good at all.
it was nothing special it was okay but not great.
this sounded like it could be a great addition to my routine
it made me breakout so badly that i have to layer on my foundation
this truly works wonders.
nothing worked for me
it has not done a thing
it feels really good, refreshing and cooling.
it worked so well
this product is not good for long term.
this product was nothing
my skin is looking amazing
this product is horrible
it really just made my skin look bad
unfortunately for me it didnt do a great job with that
it was not a pleasant experience
felt great on the skin however
this one is good but not great.
a little goes a long way.
this product is nothing special to me.
feels just as hard
i found this stuff to be disappointing
it just looks better
this was so disappointing.
this is not good.
the mask is amazingly fun to apply
it has to be good
a little bit goes a long way
unfortunately, it made me breakout.
the product is good however
it is doing nothing for my skin.
