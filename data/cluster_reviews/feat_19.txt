healthy looking which i never thought is really possible for me to achieve with my extremely sensitive
i am a junky and i am sensitive to most things!
doesn't burn my sensitive skin
for a fairly expensive face wash i'd expect easy pumping especially since even most drug store washes have that feature down
it rinses off fairly easily
like not intensely pink
which is semi sensitive
the negative reviews particularly re the scent as it's scent is so clean
the bottle is glass which feels very high end
gentle on my sensitive skincons: didn't effectively remove makeup
it is very light
no reaction or breakouts on my finicky
it's been a stressful time
be very careful when using with wet h
really helps sensitive skin for those with seborrheic dermatitis
tubes are always more hygienic!
it looks very smooth
so that damage is difficult to reverse
if you are sensitive to smells you better not use facial products
the price is a bit high
i wouldn't recommend this for sensitive skin
i would highly recommend this product to anyone with normal or slight combination skin
i am prone to breakouts with combination skin
i am very very picky about feeling any kind of residue at all on my skin
love how lightweight this is
i now have a very tight morning
this moisturizer is light and very effective.
it makes my skin so incredibly smooth instantly.
it wasn't harsh on my super sensitive skin
which is effective enough
ts' very heavy on the pocket
don't like super aggressive treatments or heavy creams
it is super lightweight
a very very small amount goes a long way!!!!!
i highly recommend this cream for anyone struggling with combination skin
very quickly i had a couple zits
it definitely helps with the hyper pigmentation
this cream works very well under my makeup.
i would rather a product that works versus an overly perfumed product that aggravates my sensitive skin
think ppl have sensitive skin should watch that
i should note that i have very sensitive
this product works amazingly.
it also has multiple ingredients that are super beneficial for your skin
'm usually very selective on what i put on my face
i highly recommend this for any skin type for your basic summer spf mositurizer
applies well and the texture is very smooth.
at first was hesitant to try this since my skin is also sensitive
most were irritating my sensitive skin or really drying it
i only use it in problematic areas
usually most of the moisturizers are heavy for my skin
the painful kind that turns very red
also still has breakouts
other serums were too rich
no odor whatsoever as well which is a bonus for scent-sensitive people like myself
it does not irritate my sensitive skin
it's gentle yet effective at clearing mild to moderate breakouts
which really helped my sensitive
i highly recommend trying this out
with very sensitive skin
i dry sensitive skin i tend to stay away from products such as this
i am so sensitive
a very small amount goes a very long way.
i highly recommend and will be buying again.
this product is super lightweight
my skin isn't too terribly dry
it's gentle on my sensitive skin
i highly recommend this to anyone with dry skin.
breakouts that weren't healing
works wonders with my sensitive skin
very lightweight, so prefect for day time!
the texture is hard to describe
kind of transparent yet thick
the price tag is brutal though
this works well as a primer too, very smooth.
firstly it feels very cooling
this product is a godsend for anyone who has extremely dry skin
very oily currently so don't need a lot
overall highly recommend this moisturizer!
my skin has behaved quite well
it isn't too intensely hydrating
would highly recommend this product
it absorbs very fast
i get extremely oily in my t-zone during the day
because of the rose extracts it is really good for sensitive skin
so far no breakouts on my very sensitive skin.
so far very very good.
$250 is a very stiff price tag
my skin is super sensitive.
especially for those with sensitive skin
very dark under eyes
this is by far the most effective!
the very easy to apply
with a very well-known cleansing oil
incredibly effective at relieving my dry skin
my sensitive skin is still struggling to find an spf it doesn't react to
it fits my skin very well
the oil is very light
it is very light
also the scent is very mild
the oil is very light
since it's such an expensive product
the scent is very light
the bottle is a bit costly
i'd been hesitant to try them because i have sensitive skin
it surprisingly did not
the smell is quite mild.
it never seemed very effective
in this regard, it does fairly well.
deeply penetrate it with moisture
recommend especially for those that crave intense moisture on their face
my skin is fairly well-behaved- no breakouts
while this product isn't inexpensive
my skin is very combination.
and super sensitive, i might add!
becoming overly sensitive/irritated
seriously the most light weight
which i normally use
the oil has a very
my combination sensitive skin tolerated this well
the bottle is glass and writing is very simple.
most oils are and make me break out.
it is very light
i find this oil very easy to use in its package
as it soaks in very well
i might also add that i have sensitive skin
i highly recommend this product.
highly recommend for anyone with dry skin or who just wants glowy skin
others described this product as greasy.
i would highly recommend this oil.
the price my seem high
i break out easily and my skin is sensitive.
like i said i'm always hesitant to try new things because my skin is sensitive
it does have a very light
i will stay loyal too
makes it seriously smooth
i highly recommend this product
being fearful of getting greasy i only used 2.
it is pricey especially for a 1
can fairly give this a thorough review
i highly recommend it
--i have normal/sensitive skin prone to breakout
my skin is also extremely sensitive
it was too expensive
it's very light weight
i highly recommend this to anyone and everyone.
i highly recommend it.
it absorbs right in with a very light
most other overnight masks feel so heavy
my skin hasn't been overly oily
why this is so expensive --
does not make the skin overly oily
the skin under my eyes is so sensitive
makes it easy to use
i highly recommend this product to anyone with the same problem
it worked very fast
this product is extremely soothing to the eye area
doesn't sting when applied to sensitive irritated skin like some of the other eye treatments that were recommended
it is also very easy to wear under makeup
i like that it absorbs very quickly
for those who are sensitive to that
i normally have very puffy eyes in the morning
this product works amazingly well.
i need to be quite careful when using it in the mornings
it is very soothing
especially in the summer
doesn't irritate my sensitive skin especially around my eye area
the stick is super convenient
i highly recommend it.
it is quite expensive
there are serums that are really expensive
iu's are generally reserved for substances taken internally
has also helped tremendously with blackheads
it removes even my most stubborn makeup
i would highly recommend you use this in combo with one of the herbivore oils
ing to my increasingly dryer skin
this soap has been the only soap i've ever used to be both sensitive enough for my skin
it controls my skin so well
extremely acne-prone skin
my acne has also given some pretty dark hyper-pigmentation
my hyper-pigmentation seems to be fading
i especially like this soap for travel
a bit on my back because i'm really sensitive to detergents
besides that it's incredibly messy
it is very soothing, not too strong.
those are very deep
nonetheless i highly recommend this br
especially around the nose
it isnt overly drying out my skin at all
no overly dry skin clients should use this
it is very thick
i am very congested in my nose
bright this is a definite keeper i highly recommend giving it a shot
-doesn't irritate my very sensitive skin
the only issue is it feels very oily
this is very lightweight
it's very long lasting
it works so well on my incredibly dry skin
at the end of the day i'm not overly greasy like i usually am
this isn't labeled as a primer
my skin is surprisingly not sensitive to this mask at all
the only reason i'm giving 4 stars is because the price is incredibly steep
highly recommend for acne-prone
it's also very thick
after use my skin looked extremely firm
if you are sensitive to fragrance i don't reccomend this though as it does have a strong perfume scent
i am very picky about ingredients.
not only it is incredibly hydrating
great for my uber sensitive slightly breakout prone easily irritated combo/oily often time dehydrated skin
my skin is uber sensitive
this is extremely light-weight
which is good because i'm acne-prone
i highly recommend this product
recommend this highly for warmer months when you need really light
since my skin has switched from extremely oily to combination
highly recommend the product
this product is a fairly concentrated alpha hydroxy acid so you have to be sort of careful with it
i find it extremely refreshing in the shower.
i would highly recommend using these two products in conjunction
this mask is very different.
unique, cute idea that isn't that user friendly.
the packaging is very interesting
loved i love that it's pre portioned this isn't the most expensive moisturizer i have ever bought
the smell is not the most favorable
it is very heavily scented
it works super well!
useful to make your skin more bouncy
this product didn't make my sensitive
was that this would be too sticky
nothing has ever worked because i have extremely dry skin
rare ingredients that are usually in much more expensive products
like 6 times as expensive
i am also very acne prone
mainly because i have very high-maintenance problem skin
has a very light firming effect as well.
i know it is kind of expensive
highly recommended for dry skins
the bottle isn't the most user friendly design
this also makes it more travel friendly.
you will find she does very thorough
could rate it fairly
tend to not use it as often as i should
if you are careful
you can tell by how strong the smell is at first that the product is very concentrated
although these have helped my skin tremendously
not too potent formula that is suppoused to work for most skin types as an in-shower treatment
i highly recommend you try it
it makes the skin very smooth
however it is so expensive!!
i like that it doesn't irritate my combination sensitive skin too
to say its pricey is an understatement
in a very thin layer
this is definitely not for sensitive dry skin!
this purifying mask is so light yet powerful on my combination-sensitive-acne prone skin
was super stingy on the price
i typically have pretty good skin
not tight or irritated
it's definitely super expensive
especially because they are organic.
especially when i expose my skin to new environments
it works very well at controlling shine
have sensitive dehydrated skin
got this as a sample for my combo skin that has recently become very dry
doesn't make my sensitive skin react
the very minimal scent is quite nice too!
it is very soothing
compared to the more expensive creams
this eye cream has been working excellently on my chronically sleep-deprived dark circles that i've had for years
more alert especially in the morning
perricone's products are extremely hit or miss for me
i highly recommend it
i highly recommend buying this gem!
it also has a very very light smell which i love!
the price point is extremely high
good on my sensitive skin.
this product is very thick
the scent is very light
tight skin that sometimes has flaky patches
it has a very light scent that isn't overcoming
i highly recommend this!
perfect for my sensitive rosacea skin.
this cream is not only very very nourishing
a big plus for sensitive skin
soothing for my sensitive skin
this is very similar in moisture level
as i'm pretty self-conscious about that
it is extremely nourishing.
my skin is very sensitive
my skin is super sensitive
since i have very picky skin
highly recommended for anyone with sensitive dry/combo skin
very similar to a face oil
the price is really steep for this moisturizer
ingredient lists lacking retinol became very important to me
i find that foundation sits extremely well on top of this
treats all problematic areas
the cream is very very very thick
i highly recommend this moisturizer
the formula is very light
highly highly recommend it to anyone with dry skin
have sensitive skin prone to breakouts
and i have sensitive skin with some acne.
i highly recommend it
i usually only use gel-like or very light-weight creams because of my sensitive skin
it is very gentle
i must say it is great for sensitive skin
my neck seems to be very sensitive to moisture creams
doesn't cause breakouts with my sensitive acne prone skin
not too strong or perfumed.
it was just very mild
if i were rich
this product works amazingly!
the directions are very clear on that.
with the most knowledgeable
it is so lightweight
four stars because it's quite heavily fragranced
i know smells are highly personal preferences
also a very natural-looking highlighter
t's quite difficult to find highlighting products that are sufficiently understated
sunblocks are always used
smells like dreamsicle and is very versatile.
kind of strong if you're sensitive to that
might cause breakouts if you have sensitive skin or are acne-prone
usually it's pretty manageable
it surprisingly just blended right into my skin
doesn't irritate my sensitive skin
have to be careful with products like this
my skin is very sensitive
great product, highly recommend!
i also love that it isn't super thick
despite it being so lightweight
'm very sensitive to ingredients
my combination skin is very unpredictable.
just keep the layer very light
it's not overly thick or overly thin.
inflamed my sensitive skin
especially those with combination
organic that will last an incredibly long time@
which is quite discouraging
highly recommend it for people who have oily skin
i am super oily with very sensitive skin.
especially if you have combination skin.
it's gentle on my sensitive skin
this is a good thorough yet gentle cleanser which does not irritate my sensitive skin
this is the first cleanser i've used that is gentle enough for my sensitive skin
sensitive or acne-prone skin
i love charcoal products because they are effective on the type of acne i usually get
is not overly drying like a lot of other charcoal products
it's very gentle while still being effective
forth between products that are gentle enough not to tear up my sensitive skin
which is great for my sensitive skin
didn't irritate my sensitive skin at all or overly dry it out
this is fast becoming goat for me!
felt great on my sensitive skin

it is suitable for sensitive skin
i am very fair with sensitive/dry skin
i tend to have very fickle skin.
it's not overly expensive

may be too much for sensitive noses
mildly sticky but not unpleasant.

flaky on certain areas
expensive ones at that
very nourishing, not greasy or too heavy.
so be careful when you pump it

i highly recommend this to anyone
several of which are more expensive
for my ladies with sensitive skin
my skin is very
and seriously, obsessed with the scent.
i find it very soothing
it's non-irritating on my sensitive skin
my skin type extremely dry to combination in areas also aging as i am sadly well past 30
i highly recommend this product.
eyes has been very pleasantly surprising
which i highly recommend
this was very gentle
it is not lightweight going on
did not irritate my sensitive skin
it is quite difficulty to explain
scent of products is very personal
i will mention that i'm not sensitive to most scents
it is fragranced so pass over this one if you're sensitive
this product feels very light on your skin
very important to me that the product not test on animals
most highlighting products either make me look older or they are super sticky
this one is very subltle
expensive for an eye cream
highly recommend it for all skin types

as a very fair white woman
it was pretty fast fora peel off mask
i wouldn't advise it on sensitive skin.
was fairly easy to peel off
the only downside is that i have really sensitive skin
the scent is very strong
that area is sensitive anyway
it is an overwhelmingly strong scent of alcohol
does it very well
continue putting the mask on if your nose is very sensitive like mine
my skin is so very smooth now.
with extremely problematic skin
does not bother my sensitive allergies
it feels rich but not heavy.
has a very light smell
it's very gentle for me though
is super nice on my very sensitive
my hormones in my 40's have my skin so sensitive
this stuff is more than welcomed by my sensitive skin
even those for sensitive skin
a lot of the products marketed to sensitive skin are not effective at removing makeup
frankly i've used more effective cleansing/micellar waters for that purpose
this is when your skin is most vulnerable to acne bacteria
it is surprisingly gentle
my skin is sensitive there naturally
this foam is incredibly gentle and non-stripping!
it's perfect for all skin types especially sensitive skin
that is designed for sensitive skin

i highly recommend this stuff.
it was very light
they told me two very useful things: first: when the booster
it works very well
i don't particularly love the price
is heavy which is unusual for this br
especially in the summer
even with mature skin i skin get breakouts
calms my sensitive skin
i highly recommend giving this lotion a try!

the scent isn't too strong like some of lancomes other moisturizers
it went on very refreshing and non oily.
this is not a heavy
this is very similar
super lightweight but effective on my dry skin.
especially for dry sensitive skin
it is difficult to squeeze from tube without getting too much because it such a thin liquid
this is very light and goes well under makeup.
sensitive skin that tends to look dull
the fact that it's such a lightweight formula
perfect for my very oily skin- only downside is the cost
so gentle on my super sensitive skin
it applies very nicely
my face is sensitive as well
especially in the summer
perhaps less sensitive or less acne prone then this is it for you

we are extremely hot
i am extremely oily and very fair.

it feels like it's cleansing deeply
this isn't sensitive enough for me
the fragrance is too strong
the only downside is the fragrance is too strong

this is super quick, effective, and gentle.
super gentle on my sensitive skin
this is extremely gentle
removes even the most stubborn waterproof makeup
my eyes are super sensitive
as someone who is not affected by scents very often
that being said the scent is very strong
i just happen to have a sensitive nose to it
if a new product made my sensitive skin breakout in new places that weren't previously irritated
it was only making my sensitive skin worse
it was just difficult dealing with it
plus o have incredibly oily skin
it was very oily
the sales assistant was ridiculously helpful
somewhat sensitive skin that doesn't break out often
i very strongly recommend this
my skin was also uneven and is fairly sensitive.
i highly recommend this product!
the scent is very unpleasant
it's very strong though
my skin is super fickle
this oil isn't drying or irritating for my sometimes sensitive skin
hyper-pigmentation for years
it isn't unpleasant or overwhelming
it's a very strong unpleasant smell
since i'm sensitive to added fragrances
my skin has been something i have been very self conscious about
used the recommended way for sensitive skin
i find this helps to clear my breakouts up very fast
it does its job so fabulously!
made it very greasy
it can be harsh or unpleasant for people who are sensitive to strong smells
this actually makes it very authentic
i do a pretty thin layer which works just as well
it is very thick
i highly recommend at least trying a sample of it
it is very easy to wash off
this is another difficult to do

worked very well with this product
my skin is quite sensitive
especially to justify the price

highly recommend this product.
trying to deal w my problematic skin

this product seems to be perfect for my sensitive
this one is super light
this is very light weight.
it is very light
very delicate yet affective.
they often have too high of a ph for my skin
i am a very fair redhead with slightly sensitive skin
which tends to behave itself except in high-stress situations when i get very noticeable acne
highly recommend this product
the stick looks so sophisticated
it's really great when i travel since it's fairly compact
the stick is so convenient!
very good for sensitive skin.
it's very sticky at first
it was very warming
especially given the price
i don't think this product is advertised as helpful for acne prone skin
am too scared to use this on my face as it has a very viscous consistency
it is very thick
this mask works very well
was hesitant to use it because i have very sensitive
it's also very pleasant on the skin
the best part: it doesn't break out my sensitive skin
skin care is super important to me
i generally have sensitive skin
i highly recommend this mask for anyone who wants a healthy glow
it's very expensive in my opinion but it works!
eye are is extra sensitive
if you are acne prone it's very calming
it can be irritating if you have sensitive skin
the smell is very pleasant as well.
one of the only things that work for acne with my sensitive skin
makes it less sensitive
surprised this isn't a more highly reviewed product
i think it is very effective too!
even with stubborn breakouts this product is a lifesaver
highly highly highly recommend this to anyone who's struggled with acne
i'd rather it smell the way it does than have fragrance added in because that can irritate sensitive skin

she has extremely sensitive skin
f you have sensitive skin or breakout easily
it would be suitable to provide hydration to all skin types as it's not heavy or greasy
my skin is sooo sensitive
easy to use, effective, moderately priced.
behave normal is very weak
i don't usually wear lotion on my face because my skin is very sensitive
most lotions feel heavy
especially for the price
have tried sooo many products to help with my uneven skin tone

i always have post acne hyper pigmentation
the hyper pigmentation has always stayed
i tend to shy away from most cleansers
as these products tend to dry out my sensitive
i breakout very easily

it is very gentle since it is in gel
s is extremely cheap
because i have sensitive skin
i highly recommend this product
apply a very thin amount on my face

my only comment is to be careful with the magnet.
i am also very picky
i highly recommend this masque for winter too!
it leaves your skin feeling extremely smooth
i highly recommend especially now during the winter
the mask itself is very smooth
it didn't upset my sensitive skin at all

otherwise the removal can be problematic
it is super moisturizering after as well !

my skin was incredibly smooth
it's important to knowif you lose the magnetdo not rinse off with water or any liquidit will fuse to the skin making it extremely difficult to remove
it is very gentle
i wouldn't describe it as a serum as it absorbs extremely quickly
the formulation could be irritating for extremely sensitive skin

gentle yet so effective.
perfect for sensitive skin.
they were super friendly
as the one own sensitive skin，it is a great product
worth the price and very gentle on the skin
this is just so gentle
fresh without irritating my sensitive skin whatsoever
the foam is very light
i highly recommend for your every day skin care
i don't usually use foaming products because i have intensely dry skin
which usually after cleansing they feel incredibly dry
feels expensive as it is glass
the only issue with this is that it is not the most travel friendly
oily yet the world's most sensitive skin
if i strip my skin too harshly of the oil it becomes an oil slick
this face wash is so gentle yet effective.
the cleanser is quite gentle yet effective.
has a difficult to describe 'vegetable' scent
you go through it fairly quickly
my skin is very sensitive
sensitive skin that is pretty dry right now
i struggle with my acne prone sensitive skin
the best part is it is so light as opposed to most cleansers that are thick or require exfoliants to get a clean
very sensitive to topical products
i highly recommend this cleanser!
the pump bottle is very easy to use
very gentle, amazing smell and effective results!
my skin is sensitive
so gentle, so effective!
it sits very well under my makeup
i highly recommend this product
it has very light scent
i am prone to breakouts
have very sensitive combo skin with a persistent forehead wrinkle that annoys me endlessly
i very highly recommend it!
my skin likes this but it is very thin.
it is very slippery
for someone with sensitive
didn't irritate my sensitive skin
that is very sensitive to moisturizers of any kind
i highly suggest at least giving it a try
this moisturizer is light but powerful.
which is obviously very unappealing
a great option for sensitive skin!
i break out incredibly easily
doesn't irritate my very sensitive skin
it also works well for my sensitive skin!
more mature skin types
how someone with insanely dry skin
sensitive skin as well
this was extremely lightweight
absorbed extremely well, left no texture.
my skin has become more vibrant
i hardly ever give 5 stars because i'm picky picky picky
have to be careful about active skin care products
it was not heavy
this stuff works shockingly well!!!
it may say that it matches most skin tones
i've always been insecure about it
it's incredibly difficult to cover without packing on the concealer
was awkward to blend since it dries pretty quickly
my skin in very fair
this product is so easy to wear
low for the perfect foundation for my very imperfect skin
i only apply this cream to the excessively red areas of my face
this lays surprisingly lightweight
the shade will probably be too dark if you have extremely fair skin
were either too heavy or too thin
or it is too thin to provide good coverage
especially on my nose
it does seem very pricey for such a small container
it does help immensely
most days i mix this
so you can practice using extremely small amounts
so be wary of that
i highly recommend for those who can't seem to get enough coverage on red areas
my super sensitive skin doesn't respond well to many anti-aging serums which is very frustrating because i need them
this is a great product especially if you have sensitive skin
most serums are way too expensive
especially for the price.
it is so easy to use, and so effective.
more effective i think
i would highly recommend this
this solves the very thing i hate about cleansers- no tight
my skin is extremely prone to break outs
it is very gentle
it is very gentle especially around the eyes.
am generally hesitant about balms
extremely effective, even on waterproof makeup.
i can highly recommend this product.
they are both equally great
i wanted to add that i have combination/ sensitive skin
my eyes got very sensitive to makeup remover over the last year
even in the sensitive eye area
my skin is fairly oily too.
i think i just have overly sensitive eyes.
my eyes are so sensitive
this also leaves it very smooth
works well for sensitive skin
while some were okay to use for my sensitive
not at all tight
just because its super fast
this is the most gentle
beyond sensitive eyes that water at the slightest sensitivity don't work for me
most of all it keeps the makeup on
it also blurs my pores incredibly well.
i highly recommend this product.
it cosmetics face products seem to be amazing for my sensitive skin
i've tried them all from low end to the ridiculously expensive
i don't particularly like eye creams.
i've used so many that are way too sticky
i've used eye creams before that in an instant made a harsh reaction on my skin especially in sensitive part such a under eye
it also has not irritated my extremely sensitive skin whatsoever
usually eye creams can become irritating
s that was too harsh for my eye area
however it still is a very good moisturizer
the packaging is pretty
does not irritate my sensitive eyes at all
i feel no sensitivity
my eyes are sensitive.
very nice cream soaks in quickly i have very sensitive skin
makes the under eye area very smooth and firm.
it's also very soothing .
which were really expensive
i highly recommend this product.
a combination that has succeeded in making me leery of most eye treatments
that sounds somewhat misleading
sensitive skin decided it would like to be dry in its most delicate regions
while of course remaining hyper-sensitive
i highly recommend it!
most surprising is how well it soothes my extremely sensitive eyes
even "sensitive skin" eye creams would irritate
i've used so many more expensive eye creams
more expensive eye creams just to cover my eye area
f you have super sensitive skin this might not be for you
the problem is that la mer price is very expensive
supple as the more expensive
i am very acne prone
it isn't overly expensive
i highly recommend this moisturizer to everyone it's the best
over all appearance almost over night highly recommend
my skin is sensitive
its not too heavy on the skin
it made me very hesitant as a lot of fragrances in makeup/skin care will cause me to have an allergic reaction
i recommend most definitely.
also they they won't irritate my sensitive rosacea/eczema burdened skin
yet was very intensive
works well i would highly recommend
sensitive-this makes me look like a totally normal person
t deeply hydrates the skin
insanely acne prone skin
and it's such a generous amount of product!
i highly recommend it!
it's not very lightweight
have super dry/sensitive skin
also wears very well under foundation.
even for sensitive skin
is super gentle on my senstive skin
i love that it's a sensitive cream
this was recommended as a heavy duty moisturizer that wouldn't break out my sensitive skin
i highly recommend this product to anyone with cystic acne
i highly recommend this if you have sensitive skin
my skin is very
also sensitive to some products
it was too heavy on my skin
it is super rich
it has helped my skin immensely.
my skin also became sensitive
my skin is very sensitive
this is the ideal cream for sensitive
i highly suggest trying this for redness
however, i get very shiny after application.
as this is veerrrry rich
the only drawbacks are that it's pretty expensive
it's been pretty helpful
it's very good for my dry sensitive skin.
the t-zone stayed extremely oily
very calming for my acne-prone
highly recommend if you have dry skin.
dont think sensitive skin will have much of a problem
it is really scary for me to try any new creams on face as i have severe reactions to most of the products
lifestyle needs has been very difficult
even though the cream is very thick i don't feel overly greasy or oily which is surprising
while i don't notice anything particularly calming about it
at the very least it keeps my skin clear
i highly recommend this product
i just bought this yesterday after a sales associate recommended it to me for my extremely dry yet extremely acne prone skin
nose have been very red
it was so painful.
this product is perfect for my sensitive skin.
so they are colorless
quick absorbing yet very soothing
highly recommend this product to people who want to sooth their skin
sensitive skin that is oddly combination
is actually beneficial to my skin
if you struggle with acne or have very sensitive skin just know that this might break you out
we both have super sensitive skin
i am extremely fair and have dry-ish skin.
especially in the summer time
over the last 30 years i have used so many different products from cheap to extremely expensive high-end products or combo products of primers
it's been difficult because i have redness
unless you only put a very small amount it makes the face extremely oily
my skin tone is best described as medium
my skin also tends to be very sensitive
great for sensitive skin too!
its not incredibly noticeable
i sometimes have breakouts
it is very thick
it wears very naturally
not trying to cover up acne or very extreme rosacea
especially around my nose
i would highly recommend this product
i swear by it because i am an incredibly fair
which hides most of my spots
highly recommend this product :)
for someone with very fair
it is very easy to use
it is extremely lightweight
the application is a little tricky
my only drawback with it is a personal issue in that i have sensitive eyes that water for quite a while after using
it works very well on my maturing skin
it smells quite unpleasant now.
this is easy to use
it's very gentle on my skin.
it works so wonderfully.
it was very gentle on my skin
didn't irritate my sensitive skin/eyes
only thing is i have extremely sensitive eyes
the skin is very smooth
i highly recommend for dry skin
it was easy to use
my skin is extra sensitive
one thing though: it is not great with sensitive eye
definitely skeptical at first because my skin is sensitive
my face was shockingly makeup free
i find that it's very gentle on my sensitive skin
i am always scared to use highly concentrated hydration products
gentle on my sensitive areas of my face
i do usually have extremely oily skin
even my most stubborn eye makeup
rosacea making my skin pretty sensitive
my sensitive skin loves this stuff.
wear fairly heavy face makeup
for those with problematic skin
the smell is very pleasing too!
it does remove all my makeup and is very gentle.
i've always found it difficult to remove my makeup
i just used one pump because i have sensitive skin
my skin is very sensitive.
cream is very light
i know that is very individual as everyone is sensitive to something else
this one is amazing i highly recommend it.
especially if i use a primer
take my money for this wildly expensive
not very budget friendly
surprisingly hydrating for such a light product.
the texture of this cream is also a win: it is more elegant then even the most high end br
it's very light yet extremely nourishing
i highly recommend it.
still making it makeup application friendly
my skin is extremely difficult
while also not being too heavy
it isn't too heavy
there are also no ingredients that are irritating to the skin or unstable
the product is so light
errs on the side of being more sensitive/eczema-prone
t's extremely clean compared to many other makeup
i highly highly recommend.
although this is rich it goes on light
my skin is also sensitive and breaks out easily.
highly reactive dry skin
i highly recommend this cream
i recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin or dry skin
i do not usually by such expensive creams
most all have failed for my sensitive skin
especially if it's natural
especially for combo skin.
am scrupulous with skin care
it really agrees with my cranky sensitive skin too
very light yet effective for both overnight
i highly recommend this product
i highly recommend this product!
i find that is very lightweight
this is a great product to use if you have extremely dry
when it does, my skin is outstandingly soft!
is very easy to apply
i would highly recommend this balm.
also makes me feel very low maintenance
have to be super careful about the products i use
my skin is more sensitized
usually i am very hesitant when it comes to face oil products
i feel like most heavy night creams are barely suitable for day time for me
if you are sensitive to smells
i generally have combination to slightly acneic skin
recently due to some medication changes my skin has gotten uber sensitive
it is super rich
i highly recommend this product
my skin has turned super sensitive due to medical treatments
since my skin is sensitive
goes an extremely long way
it's very intensive for your skin
light, doesn't irritate my sensitive skin.
there are other similarly-great eye creams at half the price
it moisterizes my eyes making them sooo incredibly smooth
soaks in very well
it was a difficult transition
made it super tight
i highly recommend it if you have dry sensitive skin like me
i've found in the last couple of years it's also extremely sensitive
found this highly recommended online
a second benefit of the treatment which was a very pleasant surprise
especially since they work
i am not sensitive to smells
i don't even have problematic skin
controlled my extremely oily skin
it absorbs fairly quick
uncomfortable in the summer
one star off for not being the most effective in removing waterproof makeup
the oils are super high quality
this is a very good alternative
this is extremely effective
have pretty sensitive skin
perfect for sensitive skin
i highly recommend this product
this is very thick, but not greasy at all.
highly recommend for sensitive skin.
as a lady with often finicky combination skin
i really highly recommend this product so far
the scent is very strong that may bother some of you
it's a good mask that is reasonably priced
my skin is very acne prone
it's again very gentle
my skin is a sensitive diva and it loves this!
both very gentle products yet the oil is wonderfully effective at removing makeup
it helps with my combination/sensitive skin
it cleans fairly well
which is pretty rare when i start using a new skin care product
breakout prone skin i was always hesitant to use an oil on my face
while it seems very thick at first
typically, i am very oily.
especially under my nose
must buy product for sensitive
it is also rich
definitely recommend especially for an emergency skin saver
even though this product is very rich
my skin is so sensitive
this turns very white on the face
my face is usually extremely oily in the t-zone areas
known for sensitive skin
i am probably the rare case that has such dry
is extremely comforting to my skin
so effective on my sensitive skin.
i've also found it pretty effective for treating my acne *surprise*
it makes it so helpful.
my face is normally combination
sometimes it is difficult to open a jar
this moisturizer is very dense.
i found this to be a very effective skin cream
cannot recommend more highly.
kind to my sensitive skin
i love the fact is natural too!
be careful not to use the product by itself because it will cause breakouts
my skin is a bit sensitive
i always used a harsh facial soap in the past because i'd always breakout
the oil works very well
in regards to the case it is very atractive as well extremely effective for storing the soap in a dry environment
my eyes are very sensitive
coming from a person with very sensitive skin
this cleanses very well
is not too harsh on the skin
the oil has used it and also seems very good.
this is very beneficial
give this duo set a 5 stars for making my skin extremely clean
because i suffer from really problematic skin
it comes in a super sturdy case
the most immediate thing i noticed after using this was how incredibly baby soft my skin was
it also comes in a very tidy
by face feels extremely clean
i highly highly recommend this to all my oily girls
it is difficult to find a cleanser that addresses that issue without being drying
it is so easy to use
surprisingly i did not notice any breakouts from it
can't say how extremely effective it was
i would love to try the one that is for sensitive skin
00 is slightly high for the product
my skin went through an extremely rough adjustment period
the package was extremely professional
this one is very affordable
this duo works great for removing even the most stubborn eye makeup very gently
my face gets super tight
it is a really travel friendly size
though it seemed a bit strong to me due to my recently sensitive nose
especially with the travel-friendly storage box
i am also acne prone
i love the packaging, very travel friendly.
is perfect for sensitive skin because it isn't super rough on your face
which i was wary of initially
i am normally cautious when it comes to trying out new face products because of how sensitive my skin is
how prone it is to acne breakouts
especially on my skin
this was very gentle in that effect
even though my skin isn't really sensitive to what i clean it with
i don't have sensitive skin
this product was very gentle on my face
i highly recommend this product!
it's very important to start out cleansing the skin without stripping out your essential oils
my skin is very sensitive
such an easy system.
the product's packaging is not too feminine
the oil burns my eyes so be very careful when using it
however i found it to be very refreshing
the soap was very strong
it left my skin so incredibly smooth!
i break out very often
the oil works very well at removing makeup
i highly recommend this product!
the packaging is very convenient for storage
highly recommend this set
my skin is extremely sensitive
super convenient for traveling
my skin is very sensitive
i highly recommend this product
aesthetically the package is pretty
i love most oils
very effective at cleansing the skin
the scent is not too strong.
the smell is very light
so to be honest i'm very picky with what i put on my face because i have very drying
because of that i had very high expectations
this set was very easy on my skin
this product is a very good product for those with sensitive skin
the bar is great for sensitive skin or those folks that hate strongly scented products
i highly recommend any erno laszlo product
i am always a little wary of oil products because i am 41 with acne prone skin
would highly recommend this to anyone with problem or sensitive skin
i would highly recommend this product!
this duo works wonders on my sensitive skin!
i would recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin
clean the face very well
they are highly effective
i got the sensitive skin one
my skin is very sensitive
it's great for my sensitive skin
it's a very quick process
just in time i got this sensitive cleansing set
i've always been very lax about washing my face
clean since i have a very sensitive utis
i love the new sensitive cleansing bar!
i would definitely recommend for dry or sensitive skin types
i would definitely highly recommend this to my family
it's not too harsh which is great for sensitive skin like mine
people who have sensitive skin know that testing new products can be risky
sensitive skin friendly product
my skin is fairly sensitive
does remove most oil
this product is very easy to use.
my skin is also very greasy
i received this erno laszlo sensitive set from influenster
can be extremely sensitive
the power 2 for sensitive skin.
also appreciate that it's available for sensitive skin like mine
is the line of the power 2 for sensitive skin
this product is meant for sensitive skin
acne-prone sensitive skin
i love this one so much because i have sensitive skin
you won't regret it especially if you have sensitive skin
was the sensitive version
it's gentle enough on my sensitive skin
especially when it comes to cleansers
this is an excellent cleansing set for sensitive skin like mine
all in all, i highly recommend this set!
my skin is obnoxiously sensitive
like it didn’t glide very well
this is great for sensitive skin
the older i get my skin has become more sensitive to certain products
i don't have nearly as much redness as i normally do which is a huge accomplishment since my skin is so sensitive it also gets very red most of the time
this travel size is perfect because it comes in a very durable case to keep the products in
i highly recommend you try this!
not been extremely red
let me start by saying i have extremely sensitive skin
it's very light weight
because my skin is sensitive
does have a few calming ingredients that are great for sensitive skin
the oil removes makeup fairly well
i tried this sensitive cleanser
also the sensitive cleansing oil smells so good
i would highly recommend this to young adults as well as middle aged women that struggle with acne
i am very sensitive to products
it leaves my sensitive skin so clean without irritating it
i highly approve it!
such an easy process
i would say i found a perfect product for my very sensitive skin
cleansing bar would be this gentle on my sensitive acne prone skin
i highly recommend it
this was catered to my sensitive skin needs
for my sensitive akin it is perfect
def helped my dry sensitive skin feel more hudrated
i don't have sensitive skin
which is rare for me to say
surprisingly i've felt that during all of my other applications
my skin is a little sensitive
recommend it to most people that need hydration
the price is a bit high
my dark circles fairly dark
i've tried a lot of creams including stuff from extremely expensive br
i am very picky about eye cream.
am very particular about products being greasy
the jar is surprisingly large
is it super effective?
dark under eye circles so finding reasonably priced
not greasy or overly cream like
sensitive skin that can get very angry with temperature changes
my skin is sensitive
highly reactive skin with rosacea added into the mix
ranging from drugstore to super duper expensive
i tend to have sensitive skin that breaks out with the wrong products
works well for my sensitive skin
it absorbs quite quick
it is very light weight
was hesitant on using it at first because of the sticky consistency
my skin was heavily congested and irritated.
was surprised at how gentle it was because i have very sensitive skin
even moisturizer for sensitive skin would burn horribly
highly recommend for dry skin!
sometimes if i'm not careful
legs are too much for my sensitive face
it was extremely soothing
sensitive skin often peels
this seemed safe enough
i've also experienced less breakouts while using this
it most definitely has a cheap honey scent
it is a very rich product
i would highly recommend it for those suffering from dry skin
it is also great for sensitive skin.
s get extremely dry
because i have super sensitive
i am extremely sensitive to smells which is why majority of perfumes
as for the criticism that it is greasy
the first 4 ingredients are incredibly moisturizing: castor oil
i highly recommend this to anyone that does a lot of work with their h
i love both products equally
also quite compulsive about washing my h
doesn't irritate my sensitive skin.
it's highly concentrated with the glitter
my skin is very fair
however having extremely dry
i would say it's the most "socially acceptable" form of "glitter" an older adult could get away with
it has has a very fine
the company perfectly described their product
it is very light weight
i've always had naturally dark under-eyes
i am also prone to millia
i feel over time with ever day use this will be a very beneficial eye cream
i get milia under my eyes very easily
have to be super picky
so their products are more expensive
i highly recommend this item!
it's even gentle enough to use on m y sensitive eyes
especially the sensitive skin under my eyes
i would highly recommend this!
especially under my eyes were i sometimes may get dark circles
i am fairly new to eye creams
it absorbs very fast
t’s very gentle to the touch of your under eye
and i'm rather picky with eyes creams too.
not extreme an uncomfortable
'm at the beach somewhat frequently as well
it makes my sensitive skin feel better immediately
sensitive skin every morning
it is very light
i'd think this would be safe for sensitive skin users like me
especially when paired with the seaberry booster.
i got this because i was going through a sensitive
it makes me look extremely oily
have fairly decent skin
it is very lightweight
my skin is ridiculously sensitive
proved to be very beneficial
so that aspect must be subjective
it initially felt overly-tightening
it's fast absorbing too which is really important
it is very important to use a small amount.
also this makes your skin more sensitive
so highly recommend using spf before putting on any sort of make up
prone to breakouts with most products i have used especially if they have any sort of oil or
combination/sensitive skin that's prone to breakouts when trying new products
this is the most potent vit.
i notice after i use it my skin is very plump
this is so lightweight
it was very small
sensitive skin so obviously i am a fan of first aid beauty
i highly recommend anything in this line!
unfortunately i have to return it because my sensitive skin is too sensitive for it
that's hard for me to find because i have super sensitive skin
they aren't too heavy
especially in the summer
this is also good for my sensitive skin.
highly recommend for dry skin!
it provides as a moisturizer for sensitive skins
it's great on my sensitive skin (no breakouts!)
highly recommend for sensitive skin!
i like to use it when i'm using a very matte foundation
was apprehensive to try it as i have very sensitive skin
would be an understatement
although if you are sensitive to smell this may not be for you
most days are pretty hot
i've tried so many given my incredibly oily skin
the smell is not too strong
this is definitely an inexpensive dupe for glamglow
i would highly recommend this been use it for my no foundation days along it works great as a moisturizer too
the good oil-based i've used have been extremely expensive compared to this
first off, i have extremely sensitive skin.
most of all felt incredibly soft
it worked very well on my sensitive skin
they are both very effective at removing makeup
highly recommend to anyone with dry/sensitive skin
this makes it so easy!
the denesity of this milk makes that a bit difficult
cottonballs wouldn't be very efficient
i often find with most removers that it makes my eye area extremely red
most miceller cleansers are very close to the consistency of water where this one was more like a water/gel
i've got combination/sensitive skin
removes makeup fairly well
its definitely very cleansing
the package is extremely tiny i was like whoa
i highly recommend trying ten out.
the scent however isn't particularly strong
my skin is also very sensitive
i highly recommend this product.
i highly recommend the green tea
still made my face very smooth
not messy or complicated mask
my skin is very very sensitive
i highly recommend to everyone
this is ridiculously priced
have been dealing with breakouts
this one is super expensive
i highly recommend this if you don't have time to throw on makeup
i highly recommend this to anyone who has angry
this mask has been very comforting to my sensitive skin that has occasional outbreaks of rosacea
the ren sensitive line home
which used to be very sensitive
it was very calming.
something has made my somewhat sensitive skin very reactive lately
this mask is a must have for sensitive or reactive skin
high recommend to anyone with sensitive
i highly recommend this mask if you have acneic skin with lots of redness
especially at a $38 price point
my extremely sensitive skin has been red
i can only use masks that are ultra moisturising
i found this mask very useful
especially exciting for anyone who suffers from irritation or skin sensitivities
my skin was sensitive of course
as someone who has ridiculously sensitive skin.
this was extremely soothing
they are both quite pricey
they are all too often sticky
first of all if you are sensitive to smells i would not recommend this
i would highly recommend this product!
however, for the size, it's very expensive.
my skin is really sensitive
highly recommended especially for the winter months
most primers irritate my skin- not this one.
it is so lightweight
not un-comfortable though
this product is extremely light weight
very good for sensitive skin
it is also surprisingly effective
i found this incredibly light
my skin does not so well with thin
just my friendly opinion.
my skin can be very temperamental at times when it comes to moisturizers
this moisturizer is extremely lightweight
i do highly recommend this for you to at least try
i highly recommend this product.
since it is lightweight yet still incredibly hydrating
it's an incredibly light
i am always leery of moisturizers because i don't want acne
the full size is fairly costly i noticed
it was fairly light
this product also kept my overly washed
too expensive to use on h
have to be careful with what i use
it's so lightweight while being extremely hydrating
so would my breakouts
my skin type is acne prone/sensitive.
have generally clear skin
the scent is fairly light
this is such a cool
one star off because this is super pricey.
highly recommend this stuff!
carefully pat very little product
my skin is sensitive
it made me look fairly matte
really like how compact
that is extremely oily
i highly highly recommended this product for anyone that has tried just about anything/everything for oily skin
very large pores in my t-zone
i highly recommend to the oily friends out there!
i highly recommend this product.
always need to moisturize heavily
it is very quick absorbing
it also preps makeup amazingly.
i definitely recommend if you have sensitive skin
my picky combination skin
it was easy to use
highly recommend for oily
my face is very smooth after using this.
very acne prone skin
i am extremely acne prone
i definitely recommend to anyone with sensitive skin
it's gentle on my sensitive skin
yet very deep cleansing
i found the product to be very messy
especially when i'm in a more polluted environment
which is great because that means there aren't many harmful fragrant chemicals that do more harm than good
it is still very expensive in my mind
love love love this cleanser, highly recommend!
the scent is very strong
having very sensitive skin i was nervous to use it
i do recommend this to people who have sensitive skin
just incredibly soft after
it's an intensive mask with a light feel
finding products that do not dry out my skin further or irritate my sensitive skin has been difficult
it rinses off very easily
especially those with strong ingredients
highly highly highly recommend this
that always makes my combo/sensitive skin clogged
only on rare occasions
i don't have super sensitive skin
overall i highly recommend.
expecting this mask to be an $80 taboo
this does sting pretty harshly
this peel is very effective.
not hypersensitive combo skin
if your skin is really sensitive just st
i would say i have sensitive skin
i highly recommend it and will keep buying it
it also looks so good that i am now hyper vigilant about sunscreen
i don't have particularly problematic skin
it wasn't painful or sensitive, just red.
i still highly recommend this product despite my user error
very good product when used correctly!
it is gentle enough for my sensitive skin
dryness are becoming more of an issue
it was easy to use
this product is the best possible dermatologist facial at a very affordable price
this mask particularly exceeded all of my expectations
my skin tone appeared very even
i know some people have said that they have sensitive skin
i still have to be careful
i personally have sensitive skin
my skin was insanely smooth and flawless.
i've dealt with very bad acne
it surprisingly did not
i highly recommend this for people with dry or sensitive skin that want a good cleanse with the skin feeling stripped
is a great option if you have sensitive skin
my skin is fairly sensitive
i personally don't find it that lightweight
it absorbes into the skin very quickly
it's not super thick and very lightweight.
feels just rich enough without being heavy.
this moisturizer is very lightweight
doesn't irritate my sensitive acne prone skin
when i first put it on it mildly burns my skin
t goes on extremely smooth
i highly recommend this product
my skin is so dry it usually gets extremely flaky
still prone to breakouts, at this age.
highly recommend for those with dry skin like me.
it's not very strong
if you are sensitive to fragrance though it will probably cause sensitivity because it smell heavily of an orange creamsicle
very expensive for the amount
am not necessarily sensitive
because the cream is so rich
i highly recommend for fellow dry skin folks
then again tidal does that as well in addition to being extremely hydrating
highly recommend this product.
causing more breakouts can be difficult
i am an extremely frugal person
i highly recommend this product!!
i am extremely picky about moisturizers
my skin is sensitive
i highly recommend this product
the acne prone areas are so smooth
my face is often patchy
it is supremely rich and not greasy.
i highly recommend it even to those with sensitive skin like me
unless you use it very sparingly
the idea of a "protective barrier" that also brightens was very appealing
it feels fairly rich at the beginning
the type they're using is super potent compared to any of the 'stronger' varieties
cons: price is a bit too high
it also absorbs well too.
first of i have fair super oily
this one is super concentrated
i am very fair with sensitive blemish prone skin
it is very rich
the fragrance has not proved irritating at all for me
i highly recommend this product.
because everything is so concentrated
overall, i highly recommend this product.
even though i have very oily skin
my fave is very sensitive

$52 cad for such a small amount of product is very upsetting
so my skin is super sensitive

it is truly lightweight
i highly recommend this product to people with dry skin i promise
most importantly the scent
it is highly fragranced
although the smell does seem to dissipate on my skin fairly quickly
although it's very rich
the thing i love the most is that it absorbs incredibly

not only is that the non hygienic way to go
as ahas can make skin more sensitive to sunlight

it is very light
as i have sensitive skin

the design of the bottle is very sophisticated

many of them being very expensive
those did not "cure" my redness caused by ultra sensitive skin

it is so sensitive that i have yet to find a face wash that keeps my skin from breaking out
to make it more difficult, i abhor thick creams.
lightweight moisturizer that is sensitive enough for your skin
i highly recommend this product for people with redness as well as dryness
not the most expensive cream or lotion i've tried by a long shot
my skin recently has gotten very sensitive
i used another all natural cream for sensitive skin from another br
it is extremely frustrating trying to find some way to control it
i feel like it moisturizes relatively well
it's very hard to find a firming product that works this quickly
my cheeks are very very very pigmented
i tried a ton of sensitive skin
i didn't pay attention to the fact that i have very very sensitive skin
dior products are costly
most anti-aging products i've tried have been heavy

i am very sensitive to breaking out
i highly recommend it!

t’s not for sensitive types
so easy to use and so effective as well.
highly recommend although it does say not suitable for sensitive skin i have seen a review with the lady saying she has sensitive skin
i initially was worried about using it because it states "don't use on sensitive skin"
often am mistaken for 40
the smell of this product is very refreshing too.
i am writing in the hope that this review might be helpful to those with sensitive skin who are afraid to use this product
i highly recommend that you at least get a sample
it also helps with my hyper pigmentation
sensitive skin which hasn't been able to tolerate other products
to protect the sensitive areas i just apply a very thin layer
because i find the aesthetics of ren's line to be very cheap-looking
let me start by saying this: i'm deeply into skin
this product is extremely effective
it's a bit difficult to h
i also suffer from hyper pigmentation
found it to be inefficient
it is a little awkward to use
especially considering that vitamin c is very unstable in solution
this product does not aggravate my sensitive skin
my skin feels more resilient
my skin is very thin
some people might be sensitive
i highly recommend this product.
my skin is sensitive to many products.
and this blends very well into it.
since this product is mostly a "protector" type
left the most stubborn
for those with sensitive skin
excellent results on my super sensitive
totally the most effective anti-aging product out there
most products are anti wrinkle
i highly recommend it
i naturally by genetics have very dark circles that can be pretty puffy
it is very difficult to find eye cream that caters to my skin tone
the results are surprisingly fast
very well even on my sunspots
it is so slippery and awkward .
i've tried quite a few eye expensive creams
not too heavy for my combination skin.
not sure how effective it is in treating severe dark circles like mine
it is not a very heavy cream
love the texture, very easy to absorb.

it's pretty effective in keeping my dark circles under control
this is very light weight
does not sting or burn sensitive eye area.

smoothed in very well
has never irritated my sensitive acne prone skin
i would definitely recommend the intense if u have extremely dry skin

it is extremely lightweight
was very cautious about trying this product due to the incredibly strong scent
i do not have sensitive skin
it is pretty steep in price
my whole face is incredibly soft
from very expensive to not so
very sensitive skin to boot.
it also moisturizes very well for me.
acne prone skin that is not sensitive
why this product is not suitable for very sensitive skin
it will not irritate sensitive skin or clog pores
my skin typically fluctuates wildly between flaky
very very nourishing and not that greasy.
it's been very good for my mature combination skin
it may be too heavy
i've got normal, slightly sensitive skin.
i am very sensitive to smell
my skin is very easily stressed
at least include a warning for those with sensitive skin?
i imagine if my skin was sensitive
if you don't have sensitive skin
though he really dislikes it for his own very sensitive
it could've been an allergic reaction because i have extremely sensitive skin
very sheer amount on the skin
very soothing as well.
my skin is extremely sensitive
though i use it sparingly on my chin where i tend to get most breakouts
those sensitive to scent may want to steer clear or sample first though
i admit the price is always steep
usually complains when i wear them because they are too strong for his sensitive nose
it is extremely expensive for an average product.
i am pretty picky when it comes to moisturizers.
the price is kind of high too
i really like how this moisturizes deeply without sitting very heavy on the skin
nature that has the effect
my skin is extremely sensitive
i highly recommend this product.
like most of perricones products do
am often complimented on my skin
non-irritating to my skin
it goes on very easy
i highly recomend it.
i am always a bit wary of any moisturizers

my face is sensitive
it's so powerful, yet gentle.

gentle yet very effective

yet extremely effective facial cleanser
it is very convienient
very gentle to my skin
the side effects were too risky

very expensive but worht it.
this bad boy is loaded with powerful antioxidants too
was extremely light weight
it' a very potent product
i highly recommend it!!
eyes are very sensitive
i've tried many very expensive eye creams
my skin is normally pretty sensitive
this eye cream is very light
it is gentle yet effective
my skin has always been insanely oily
that was too much for my sensitive/oily skin
does not irritate my sensitive eyes
think it is priced similarly to other products i have used such as murad
particularly since citrus-based products can make you more sensitive to sunlight
since i am very picky about cleansers
it is very concentrated too- half of a pump is more than enough for a lightly sudsing face cleansing
smell is very important to me
it is very effective in smoothing the lines under my eyes
i gave it only 4 stars because it is so very costly
extremely effective at fighting wrinkles
it takes very little pressure to apply to the delicate under eye area
if i were rich
this is a very rich
deeply hydrating cream that is too heavy for daytime use for me personally
the price is way too high
especially if you are 40+
it can often be quite difficult for a new product to show results quickly
this is a little awkward
although this product is expensive
i love this product and highly recommend it.
a delivery system for treatment products is very important
no breakouts very mild but it cleanses

this cleanser always finds more
for my 40-something slightly sensitive
i know for sensitive skin smells can be irritating
it works very well with my clarisonic as it is a non oil based cleanser
makeup goes on over it very easily.
this is fairly lightweight
though even that was quite steep
i recommend using this product in conjunction with a wrinkle treatment as wrinkle products can be particularly harsh
which seemed too costly
although was hesitant knowing the line is well perfumed
doesn't effect my overly sensitive skin once so ever
light, delicate, but powerful.
scent is very important to me when buying products
my skin was incredibly dry
light, but very effective .
this past year my face has become extremely dry
that was because it was a bit raw
it is super light
it is also very lightwieght
this moisturizer is perfect for my sensitive

my skin is so dry, but is soo sensitive.
it really is very gentle on my face.
because it is very rich
it is great for my sensitive skin
most of their products are truly outst
this day cream does not irritate my sensitive skin
perfect for normal-sensitive skin like mine!
i highly recommend to all

certainly recommended for those with not very oily skin
my skin is also sensitive
i am very picky-an i give this 5-stars
it has a light rose fragrance which disipates reasonably rapidly--i do not like scented products normally
she has sensitive skin
if it can change the most stubborn
it somewhat aggrevated it
very effective for older skin.
it does not cause any adverse reactions such as breakouts

hyper sensitivities at times
it doesn't irritate my sensitive skin
my skin is super sensitive
picky about what i use
this is a great moisturizer for people with sensitive skin
my skin is very sensitive
my skin is so sensitive
though i wouldn't describe it as a lightweight product
whenever my sensitive skin reacts to something this is my go-to product
my sephora store was so helpful
plus my face is super sensitive
it is animal friendly
definitely a must buy i highly recommend for any of you that have sensitive skin
not to mention reacting with my sensitive

i believe this is a great cleanser for anybody with sensitive skin

nothing has been quite as effective as this product
i live in an extremely dry climate with very dry sensitive
compared to some other very high end moisturizers
not for oily skin, as this really is quite rich.
it is very expensive
it is indeed greasy
very good cream for anti aging.
most people says that this is greasy

they are not inexpensive
i highly recommend this product to anyone who has normal to slightly dry skin who is experiencing time starting to march arcoss the face

it works well for my super picky skin
that has the consistency of a rich cream too
the one constant is that i have seriously sensitive skin

my skin hates change so finding effective masks is a tricky process
the mask in the skin is very gentle
it didn't aggravate my sensitive skin
i would've given this 5 stars if not for the very high price tag
be careful not to get too close to your eyes
this is great when you particularly want softening
it is not overly expensive ounce per ounce compared to glamglow
i recommend this mask highly.
particularly my massively fatigued feeling undereye area
you can use this mask in less sensitive areas
also, super easy to work with and wash off!

is very lightweight which i love
the texture is very light
i am very picky when it comes to moisturizers
the most important point is these formulated without all the nasty stuff like parabens
i would highly recommend this
by the fact that it is lightweight
still moisturizes much better than most lightweight products on the market for people with combo/oily skin types
it makes makeup application difficult
my skin tends to be very sensitive
it's very lightly fragranced
super picky combination skin
it feels super rich
didn't break out my sensitive

because it's so expensive
my skin is very sensitive
i hate how most are so greasy
have trouble finding anything with anti-aging properties that is not also overly active or harsh
the texture is quite smoothier
the smell is very addictive
are there equally good creams out there for less?
the exfolikate is very strong
i think it is repairing skin somewhat.
despite other reviewers claiming it to be too rich or heavy
it is very expensive
especially when i use exfolikate with it
very thick and very rich.
which is great since it is costly
also did not bother my very sensitive eyes.
i highly recommend this!
on the very high side
mpressed that as expensive as the product is

it works especially well when coupled with the exfolikate product
highly recommend both and will purchase again.
would highly recommend it
how sensitive my skin is
problematic skin for years now
i am very sensitive to a lot of foaming cleansers
the amore treatment cleansing foam has helped tremendously

it works very well
for someone who has sensitive skin
also like most people said
i stuck wtih it because i have really sensitive skin
i highly recommend both products.

was very averse to products with oil
my skin is not usually sensitive
the packaging was also very leaky
this is the most calming
acne prone skin so of course i was hesitant
only thing that saves me combo/ sensitive skin in the winter
my only concern is that you have to use very little or be very careful at the time you are applying it with the cotton pad
gives my very normal skin
does not cause breakouts even though is considered an oil

especially my eye makeup
i am very sensitive to them

the area was still very red after the fact
this is quite pricey
my skin tended to be very oily
stupidly excessively using tanning beds when i was in my teens
i highly recommend this product.
neither as gross nor unpleasant as other people described it to be
however, it is a bit arduous of a product.
this stuff is incredibly effective.
alas it is also the most ridiculously expensive cleanser ever
it's sensitive like crazy
it is slightly irritating to my rosacea--i think using a cloth in general is a bit irritating
it is super expensive.
this balm is very thorough
it deep cleanses the most difficult makeup with gentle ease
this did nothing to worsen it despite its somewhat oily nature
if you are very sensitive to smells this might not be for you
my skin is very sensitive and acne proned.
winter has also been causing my skin to feel incredibly stripped
my skin is hypersensitive to selective ingredients
removing my makeup can be very irritating
i would highly recomend this for women of my age
it removes makeup extremely well.
it had a very different texture than most cleansers
doesn't feel extremely feminine
it's prohibitively expensive for me
it is very expensive
it was an extremely luxurious feeling
it was great for my sensitive
very deeply dissolves every scrap of my makeup
imy skin is really sensitive to soap
which helps with my sensitive skin
also not overly drying as i have very dry skin
it has such high quality ingredients too!
i highly recommend this product.
it removes makeup very well
it's so gentle on my sensitive skin
this scent is just not particularly appealing to me

that works perfectly with my sensitive skin.
it is surprisingly good at removing makeup
i highly recommend this product.

it's very concentrated i found myself using less
very gentle but cleans deeply without drying.
it's extremely gentle on skin
this is just right for my sensitive
this cleanser is gentle, yet effective.
think it is ok for sensitive skins
it's also very gentle
because it's more "natural" it's a little harsher on skin for sensitive types
i occasionally supplement with a bha/aha cleanser if my skin is feeling particularly problematic
my skin is sensitive
i highly recommend it.
my skin is extremely sensitive
i highly recommend it
especially if you have sensitive skin
this is a great non-abbrasive cleanser perfect for even sensitive skin
if it weren't so expensive
i would describe this product as lightweight
i highly recommend this product.
my face is incredibly clear-- no antibiotics needed
this is a very good moisturizer for those with blemish prone
it's very light -- a lotion -- which i like because i have sensitive/acne prone skin
which is rare for me
it hasn't caused my sensitive
it has a scent i am not overly fond of
because i have sensitive combination skin with occasional breakouts
heavy night creams are too rich for me
especially for the spring
the overall healthy quality of my skin makes my face look equally young
... this lotion is working ... very well !!
this comes highly recommended with gold stars all over it
and it comes with a very generous amount to boot!
was worried because i have very sensitive skin
firstly because of my sensitive skin
because i am overly frugal
it is often difficult to find a lightweight lotion that is effective as well
it is very effective
i sometimes have problems with reactions to products as well

but alas........ it is very pricey.
i highly recommend it!
the cream itself is very thick
this is the most important step in my skin care system
absorbs fast so you use very little

just a very thin layer
because it was very chemically
i am sensitive with too much scent.
this product is so rich
i am normally incredibly fussy
get flakey very easily
is because its really expensive
it is great for sensitive skin since its not too harsh
i am sensitive, redness prone skin.
it can make your face overly saturated
it also doesn't irritate my sensitive skin whatsoever
the jar packaging however is not very hygienic.
which most products do
which made a difference to my overly sensitive
what i enjoy about this product is that it deeply moisturizes without feeling heavy or causing breakouts
your face is extremely smooth
my sensitive skin loves this
this cream seems to stay on very well
it's a very rich cream
this product is expensive
it takes very very little to cover the face
still have acne prone
i highly recommend this cream

the reason that i am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is the relatively heavy fragrance

since product work very well
this is very light weight
it is very rich
yet not overly thick
feminine- i don't think it is too strong at all
the scent is fairly strong

if you aren't sensitive to that
which is super helpful

its been fairly good
i've found that results can very for some pimples/breakouts

i cannot recommend them highly enough!
this was really effective.
the ingredients are of very high quality
non irritating on my sensitive
neither irritate my sensitive skin which is rare
i want to talk about the product's effectiveness: it absorbs freakishly fast
i believe it is gentle enough for people of all skin types to use
i highly recommend it!
it did not irritate my ovely sensitive skin
this product was extremely helpful
i highly recommend this to everyone!
t might irritate those sensitive to smells
this stuff is very lightweight
this may be a very effective cream
it goes away very fast
it's safe for my senstive skin too.
my skin was very tight
the scent is very appealing to me
it's not greasy, and absorbs fairly quickly.
it seems very lightweight
the price is very reasonable
i highly recommend you try this if you have dry skin
gentle enough for my very sensitive skin
so the price is very reasonable
my skin is was prone to breakouts
the size is very generous
have to have a very effective moisturizer
on the contrary i quite like the " young
especially if you have sensitive eyes
equally soothing on a hot day or after a stressful moment
traveling is always stressful in itself
it works unbelievably well.
it has never irritated my sensitive skin
i would highly recommended for anyone wanting to lessen the appearance of your post acne scars
particularly on my nose
i highly recommend it.
i highly recommend this product.
don't use it if i am going t be extremely active
it is very break out prone
but i highly recommend it!
the store manager was gracious enough to give me plentiful amounts of samples
i also like that it doesn't irritate my super sensitive skin
i love how this doesn't contain synthetic fragrance since my skin can be extremely sensitive
most were too heavy
it is incredibly light
doesn't upset sensitive skin
it does not have alchohol which is very rare
a tiny bit foams up unbelievably
this product work surprisingly well on my face
it also lathers extremely well
it s not that kind of moiturizer that is lightweight
i highly recommend it!
plush in the sense that it hydrates overly large pores
it's also unbelievably small
this product certainly feels good on the sensitive under-eye area
the stick can be difficult because its large to maneuver around eye areas
for those like me with sensitive skin
i can't believe there are negative reviews regarding this product because of how incredibly effective i have seen this to be
it is very cool
depuffs under eyes pretty fast
it is very often that i am on the searching for eye area products
very cooling and helps to depuff those bags.
very red skin for days
that left my face extremely oily
shes very picky when it comes to choosing her creams
most are either too rich
i am likely too young
it hasn't been too rich for my combo skin
usually i wouldn't like such a strong scent because they might sensitize my skin
it is on the expensive side
it does that very well
bonus, makeup applies amazingly on it.
this product works very well
even with a very high price tag on it
i highly recommend for anyone with sensitive skin that is normal to dry
all of their products are very gentle
my face actually feels balanced which is rare since most moisturizers seem to tip my skin one way or the other
it's not quite as lovely as omorovicza's intensive hydra-lifting cream
now i know eye cream doesn't have to be very rich to be effective
i do not have sensitive skin
are all expensive skin this good?
this is powerful in cleaning and super mild.
since my skin is super sensitive
which is extremely rare for me
this is very rich
my only gripe is that it is very expensive
hope it was helpful
my face always feels exceptionally clean
gentle yet effective cleansing experience
my skin is normal for the most part–
even very expensive ones generally have ingredients that are actually bad for your skin
i couldn't try a lot of products because i have super sensitive skin
i've always been pretty self conscious about my dryness
costly i like the results.

the scent is very light
i highly recommend it for those of us with dry skin issues
is keeping my face rich
the unfortunate truth is that the other 3 oils offered are quite damaging
yet still surprisingly light
it leaves it very balanced
since none of them are essential oils or particularly irritating for skin
i think this product is excellent for sensitive skin too just as it states
she said the juno oil is good for sensitive skin
that is very smart way to introduce the unknown products
i sometimes have issues with my skin getting a little sensitive
i reach for this oil especially as it does not have any essential oils that irritate me
most anti-aging oil blends feel too heavy
no breakouts either and i'm usually prone to it!
t's no longer overly oily in patches
the frequently mentioned smell fades very quickly so was no deal breaker for me as the oil itself is incredibly moisturising
this product may be a bit expensive
one thing that i found particularly annoying was the leaking bottle
sensitive skin that is also very acne prone
the product is too pricey
very non-problematic skin
otherwise it wouldn't be deemed as natural
it is quite expensive
especially if you use sparingly
it was way too harsh on my sensitive skin
was worried i'd be one of the unlucky very few to have breakout issues since i have sensitive skin
as a gal with extremely oily skin
this stuff is effective
love how lightweight this is
if your skin is super sensitive use it as a mask
start off slow as this stuff is very powerful
with sensitive skin touch you or it will burn them
if you're sensitive to smells
while my skin is pretty sensitive
nothing ultra drastic yet
the texture is very light
i highly recommend it if you have similar skin issues
the only thing is because this is acid it can be a little stingy for my sensitive skin
because of its very high price tag
my skin is very sensitive
especially with "natural" br

her products are expensive

the minimal foaming is actually preferable to the cleansers that are excessively foamy
most of my breakouts are gone
as i have very sensitive skin that can react terribly to certain products
especially in the summer time
have to be careful not to use harsh cleansers
struggling with combination acne-sensitive skin meant almost losing hope on most products i've tried
am extremely loyal when it comes to great products

so this oil surprisingly does the trick for both
sensitive skin prone to redness
made my skin very fragile
i know this product is expensive
are allergic too which is also a bonus
in my opinion the full size is still fairly reasonably priced for serums of this nature
the skin specialist atseophora was so helpful
my sensitive skin has made it difficult to find one that doesn't make me more dry or irritated
this one actually seems to be helpful
they are usually fast results
the lines around my mouth are fairly deep
especially around the mouth
which is supposed to be for sensitive skin when i first tried this
plus i have very sensitive skin.
i am very sensitive to products
however my skin becomes oily again pretty fast.

sometimes if my skin is excessively dry
i highly recommend this product to anyone.

the salicylic acid treatment works exceptionally well too
it is super expensive
it's definitely on the gentler side however super effective

this did not irritate my sensitive skin.

i highly recommend it.
i also like that the scent is not very strong at all
my son has very sensitive skin
i break out very easily

in korea we are very serious about our face creams
comforting yet it sinks into the skin very quickly
it's just as good as many of the high priced moisturizers

probably moreso for sensitive skin

this moisturizer is very effective
which was very challenging with prior lotions

if anything i'm even more selective about what i genuinely like
this one surprisingly has not
i highly recommend it.

most oil-free ones i've tried have been super sticky
i am very picky with products.
because it is 'pore correcting' it can make my sensitive

who has very large pores
my skin is very sensitive
follow the directions exactly for sensitive skin
sensitive skin with occasional breakouts
my sensitive rosacea skin did not like it beyond that

this is a very unique formula for a cleanser.
s to often be not a very nice quality

which can be quite sensitive
i just have to be careful with the bottle
my skin is generally really oily in some spots
my skin clogs very easily
i am very careful over my rosacea-prone cheeks
it isn't too harsh for my picky somewhat sensitive skin
so many other natural serums have ingredients i'm sensitive to
your skin is generally red
i am very sensitive to fragrances
for those sensitive to smell this may not be for you
these products are the very best on the market
i've found it to be very soothing
is not for people with scent sensitivities
it makes the skin very smooth
this is embarrassingly expensive
as they are highly sensitive
for highly sensitive skin
this product is highly hydrating
i find it somewhat amusing that most people hate this scent
to me it proves they are so used to artificially scented things
it's pricy, but most natural products are.
does not aggravate my sensitive rosacea skin
i tend to be sensitive to witch hazel because it is often combined with harsh alcohol to maintain freshness
its most effective keeping it cool in the fridge

last an unbelievably long time considering it is so concentrated
i do not have sensitive skin
i highly recomend this oil for dry
i worried about using the oil on what was now very painful skin
it does sink in very fast
most of them tend to leave a residue

it is on the expensive side
it soaks in very quickly too
it absorbed very fast

along with the night ampoules are very expensive
even though it's not the most affordable product
i highly recommend it
the price tag is difficult to swallow

i can give a first impression review: it goes on very 'wet' like most serums
i've tried everything for my extreme dry skin which is also super sensitive
it actually seems relatively hydrating
lately i've had extremely over oily annoying skin
i've used some really expensive serums out there
as with most products

t xxy are the two most effective cleansing waters i've tried
don't irritate my sensitive skin
if i were sensitive to scent i'd avoid this product
usually products are very heavy
the caudalie water is by far the most effective
yet still very gentle water out there
then deeply cleans the face of all makeup
my skin is so extremely dry
however, it is very overpriced.
the most expensive product i have fallen in love with
highly recommend this product if you can afford it
it is very pricey
is quite sticky as expected
it is good for sensitive skin
extremely expensive but totally worth it!
i would highly recommend it.
this is by far the most nourishing

similarly priced moisturizers before

incredibly lightweight and amazingly soft!
it is very refreshing!
it may be ideal
it has worked surprisingly very well for my skin
some are still stubborn
the pads are highly saturated
because the formula is very strong
i imagine that more frequent use would be more effective
helps with dark spots too
disclaimer: i have sensitive skin.
the pads are very saturated
these pads are tough
adult acne that i highly suspect is caused by the fact that my skin doesn't turn over fast enough
i can see someone with sensitive skin not enjoying these
these are super intense pads, but so good.
i recommend for anyone who suffers from acne no matter how moderate or heavy
after a particularly terrible hormonal breakout
they definitely seem effective.
i definitely would not categorize my skin as sensitive
i also don't have very sensitive skin
it is important to be vigilant about this.
my skin is prone to sensitivity
this worked fairly well on small blemishes i get on my cheeks
nothing topical does really
i don't have sensitive skin
a very unpleasant burning/stinging sensation that lasts much too long
i don't have sensitive skin
very tolerable amount for me
not for sensitive skin though
most of my breakouts have been prevented because of this
if you're sensitive to scents

this is coming from someone with mega high pain tolerance with sensitive skin
this one works very well on my acne.
the first couple of times it is very itchy.

this one is the most effective
my skin is exceptionally clear
i tend to have combination skin
the product is very rich
the it has a very light
cream albeit a bit pricey
but not too thin.
this mask is in my opinion quite expensive
hyaluronic acid is most effective when it is less than 4% of a solution
ideal for sensitive skin too
this product is expensive, but great for a treat.
removes makeup very well
my skin is also very sensitive.
this remover though is complicated to use
soothing the process is too
it’s usually very difficult to find a cleanser that removes everything without drying me out too much
the ingredients are incredibly high end with multiple benefits
the recommended process is somewhat time-consuming
(i don't very often.)
my sensitive skin reacts really well to it
it takes off my makeup exceptionally well
it is a bit expensive
if you are sensitive to smells it may be a bit much for you
this product is very pricey
super useful for leaning.
my pores get very congested
eve lom is very gentle
also gets dehydrated extremely easily
i've always considered cleaning my face a chore
most products that would treat my congested skin are very drying
i highly recommend it!
my skin is sensitive
my skin is very sensitive
since coming off acutane even though my skin is sensitive this has been amazing
on a less positive note this cleanser is absurdly expensive
even the most stubborn mascara
penetrates deeply in the skin
it is pricey-especially for a cleanser
the most stubborn eye make up too.
i am prone to breakouts
its either worsend my breakouts or irritated my sensitive
this was probably the most unusual cleanser i've used
among the most gentle deep cleansers i've ever used
even though the price is very high for the cleanser
my skin looks expensive
it will become transparent
admittedly, i use this mask too often.
despite of some dryness that still occurs with my sensitive skin
my pores were incredibly tight
i've tried several most popular cleansing masks in the market
the results are very distinct
i highly recommend this mask!

great for sensitive skin
my skin is very sensitive to everything -- except this product
but this one preformed amazingly!
i highly recc'd this product if you have a regiment
my fair skin can be sensitive at times which is why i've struggled with retinol in the past

especially with results like this :-
work your way to nightly if you are hyper-sensitive to retinoids

it is really expensive
i am even more fastidious
i feel very protected
all day eye cream should have it for that delicate skin area
it seems to work fairly well
i has a high spf that is very gentle for my sensitive eyes
my skin is just really sensitive.
that is not attractive
usually lancome's scents are too strong
highly recommend this product!
i've tried everything from the most expensive to the super cheap stuff
tone 2 is for most individuals because it is the most common skin tone to have
tone 3 is for very dark skin types unless i have found that tone 3 is better on acne

there are equally as good products out there for half the price
which makes putting on makeup difficult

it is very expensive
i find it to be too heavy for my skin
or super hyper pigmentation

i love most shiseido products!
that's important because not only are my eyes super sensitive
i highly recommend this eye cream

they weren't very large to begin with
too bad my sensitive combination skin is allergic to this because i'd buy it in bulk

using is product just once help immensely
good products are expensive

my dark circles are naturally quite dark
which it does very well

especially on my nose
the only problem is they're incredibly sticky/strong

because the mask is very intense

person that has sensitive skin
my skin is very sensitive especially to heavily scented products
this mask is just as described-- gentle
my skin is already very red naturally
not in an uncomfortable way
my only caution is that if you have dry or very sensitive skin
i feel like this particular glamglow product is underrated because people tend to flock to the other more intense masks
am enduring the increasingly drying skin of nearing 50 years old
was hesitant to purchase because of how expensive they can be
they don't annoy my overly sensitive
i must have sensitive skin or something
as i find it extremely effective
the concentration of hyuloronic acid seems to be quite potent
26 so i definitely have "mature" skin issues.
this is a eye gel/cream which is reasonably priced for the benefits
the droopies are very obvious
it is very soothing
really sensitive/ itchy eyes
particularly one i can use under makeup
yes it is very sticky.
some of these people make no sense or are just overly picky
it spreads very easily

be careful if you have really sensitive skin under your eyes
the women directed me to this very inexpensive product
it is a very sticky
it feels very cooling
the hyper-intense sensation which did not feel cooling
especially for the price!
most resurfacers are like 4x more expensive for the amount you get
this one is great for sensitive skin
probably wouldn't recommend to someone with super sensitive skin

so naturally i also have hyper-pigmentation

it may seem expensive
not in a gross or overly sweet way
non-sensitive skin with hyperpigmentation

my very stubborn blackheads are nonexistent
all with very different skin types including sensitive skin
i am on a pretty strict diet right now
it also makes my skin fantastically smooth
also: i have very sensitive skin
it burns rather intensely the very first time you use it
it may be too abrasive
this mask stings quite intensely while wearing it

my skin is on the sensitive side
especially the pump bottle
i do agree that it is very oil absorbing

this is just what my slightly sensitive
my skin is sensitive to many skin products
i am very particular about any products i use on my skin
therefore cannot/will not see as intensive results as someone with more mature skin

normally i have very oily skin
i don't use it during daytime since it is very rich

uncomfortable on that spot
my skin is left feeling incredibly smooth
it was easy to use
my skin isn't sensitive
can also get very dehydrated easily
;) skin was also super smooth.

which is so rare
this is a very gentle product

also it is very pricey.

it is very good for sensitive skin and dry skin.
the price really is steep for a cleanser so 4 it is
more environmentally friendly than my old makeup removal routine
this is a very gentle face wash.
this is very gentle on the skin.
is also extremely gentle
removes makeup very easily
so people who are sensitive to fragrance might fare too well
it works amazingly well

most of the complaints about this product are the fact that it is greasy
i feel the packaging isn't appealing
so cleansing without stripping is also very important
i highly recommend it for those 40 or over.
this product will remove even the most stubborn of makeup
it is very lightly scented which is good for the skin

was concerned about it being too rich for my skin
which i find very unpleasant
it is not lightweight
also not too heavy
it's hard to believe how effective it is given that the texture is so light
my skin gets super temperamental
my skin is so sensitive that it breaks out with any other moisturizer that i've tried
it is very tricky when choosing an item for oily skin because it often causes dehydration
hyalo is by far most hydrating
i know it is not inexpensive

i generally say my skin is normal
i know it is technically an "overnight mask"

super gentle and non-irritating.
this cleanser is very gentle

my skin is easily irritated by most products
most importantly no acne of any kind
it really deeply hidrates the skin
sometimes i had breakouts
the circles under my eyes were very dark.
even with my sensitive skin
as my skin is very sensitive
it's also very pricey
truly a holy grail product for my sensitive
it hasn't cause any breakouts which is rare for me
this mask is definitely more intensely moisturising than any other lotion or oil i've ever used
especially for sensitive skin clients
this was a splurge product, but very effective.
probably the most effective nighttime hydrating cream i have ever encountered
especially in the summer
plus this particular serum glides on very well
very light and easy to absorb.
however this serum do just right for me: gentle yet effective
especially with summer approaching
the bottle is extremely small
i highly recommend their pure revival peel
i struggle with hyper pigmentation
sensitive skin hence not many products work for me
i am usually very hesitant to start new products
i also love how it is non-sticky
pretty sure this product suits even very sensitive skin as i have eczema problem
although this product is very expensive considering the size of the bottle

not travel friendly cause it's a fairly weighty jar
very helpful for dry skin.
highly reccomend for very dry area
it is so versatile
it is non-irritating as well
i've used very expensive products over the years
must be careful as i break out easily
on even the most raw
since it is very similar in texture to coconut oil
t is great for sensitive skin
it is quite expensive
without the less desirable side effects
have to be careful with that
found this to be extremely helpful
whenever i get hyper pigmentation from a rare breakout
excellent for sensitive skin.
overall it does clean very well
the price is pretty high
dr jart products are so good on sensitive skin i highly recommend it

because i'm usually quite decisive
that was way too harsh for my sensitive skin
it's great stuff, and i highly recommend it!

even under makeup if it is applied very lightly

the excess product was very easy to rinse off too
it's very thick and rich.
it spreads very well
through the night it seems that my skin absorbs it very well
most importantly the skin is firmer
it is super heavy!

the name is somewhat misleading as i look at this product as a really intensive night cream
this is a very thick
highly recommended for those with dry
doesn't feel overly heavy
my skin is water sensitive so being able to put this mask on
great for those with environmentally sensitive skin types

this product is expensive
am very prone to dehydration
especially for the winter
since it is so expensive
because it's pretty expensive
the only reason why i didn't give it 5 stars is because its very heavily scented with essential oils which can be extremely cloying at times
sometimes is tricky to get the product out

that is too expensive just to remove makeup
i love that this isn't overly harsh or full of chemicals
very gentle with high hopes it will do what it says

yea the price is pretty steep
it has very quickly became one of my holy grail products

being in my early 20's i found most of the anti-aging products out too intensive for my needs
especially around my eyes
so finding a moisturizer is difficult enough.
my skin seems to be very balanced
without making sensitive skin red or raw
regimens than i can count is an understatement
oddly enough, this is also very hydrating.
great for my finicky skin
sensitive skin which can be a challenge to deal with
get tired of using super harsh products as my skin is starting to get sensitive
was very comfortable to use
i've become quite obsessed with face masks
it's really been effective
highly recommend this trick
especially at this price.
this mask is super effective
super gentle on my sensitive skin
it is however extremely difficult to wash off.
still have combination skin
highly recommend especially if you don't like the feeling of typical mud masks
most masks tend to make my face red
especially if my skin is feeling sensitive or breaking out
it makes my skin very refined
this mask is amazing for my super sensitive oily skin
coming from a person with sensitive
it moisturizes quite well too.
*my skin is super sensitive to so many products
caution using this if you have very sensitive skin
not recommend for extremely sensitive skin
it seems super pricey i know
it's very gentle for my sensitive skin
excellent for my sensitive skin.
it has a tacky consistency that is *sort of* difficult to remove
my skin is not sensitive at all
f you have sensitive skin i would suggest getting a sample since some have found it irritating
i can't speak more highly of this one
because i felt it was very similar to the charcoal masks that are so popular right now
easily the most amazing.
my boyfriend who has very large clogged pores benefitted the most from it
which was surprisingly easy
it is a bit difficult to remove
i definitely highly recommend this soap
i've had my cousin who has extreme sensitive skin to try it
great for combination skin that is also sensitive
this cleanses very well.
the only downside is that its very messy to use.
i highly recommend it for women and men.
have to be very careful as to which products i chose
my hyper-pigmentation is better
this soap is very effective in brightening my skin
it's quite expensive but it is a large soap.
its very light and comfortable to wear.
this black soap is incredibly even more amazing
also very good for sensitive skin
it's lightweight enough for my sensitive skin
unless you have sensitive skin
it's also suitable for all skin types
which look extremely young
its rare that i do breakout
especially when using the clarisonic

amazingly enough, i (and others!)
my circles are very dark
this product although expensive
the eye cream works very quickly
while i'm not prone to dark circles
i would highly recommend this product!
i couldn't speak more highly about this product.
i highly recommend this product to any one that says they have tried it all
sensitive skin this is for you
my skin is combination, sensitive and dehydrated.
i find it works very well with a slightly moist face
it also controls my very oily t-zone !
this makes my face very
my skin is very sensitive
be aware if you have sensitive skin not to use it every day
it can be harsh
it wasnt too drying like most reviews are saying
the method of mud to foam is also very fun
with my foreo for normal/sensitive skin
especially since most washes i feel sometimes turn too quickly
it was very mildly exfoliating
found it was a mistake because this glowglam product is so gentle
even if i am gentle
it was surprisingly smooth and didn't tug at all.
this cleanser seems very effective and gentle.
it is very mud-like
be careful if you have sensitive skin as i do not
it was not the most pleasant-
i highly recommend this product.
this cleanser is a bit too strong for me to use daily
though too strong to use daily
this one is so gentle
even after just one use i found my skin was incredibly soft

even ones geared toward sensitive rosacea skin
so trying anything new is always worrisome

s products overall are fairly pricey

it's also extremely dry
this tends to all of those very nicely
i highly recommend it
except for my excessively oily friends
i am always super hesitant to try new skin products
i'd wake up with extremely oily
highly recommend this for people like me who have sensitive
it works well with my sensitive skin.
it does clean it very well
my skin has been extremely dry!!

my eyes are also extremely sensitive to chemicals
so easy to use in the morning
this is the first product that i have found to be remarkably similar to the dior product
this is way too expensive
this exfoliator is gentle enough for my extremely sensitive skin
i can be as abrasive or as gentle as needed

i highly recommend this product
they are very effective for dryness together
know this product also works extremely well alone
i highly recommend this as a night time eye cream
have really sensitive skin
even more sensitive eye area
i highly recommend this to men and women!
that's because my undereye area was still sensitive from trying a different cream
wouldn't use it in the mornings as it is quite rich

even on my extremely dry sensitive skin

i surprisingly loved luna way more
everyone's skin is extremely different
although i am very sensitive to smells
at first i was really hesitant to use this as i have sensitive
which is disappointing because the product is expensive
love how lightweight this is

if you're sensitive towards scents
the smell is very strange though.

i also should mention it has a very strong
i can imagine it could be a put off or a cause of allergic reaction to a sensitive skin
i've found this product to be very helpful at solving my dry skin issues
sensitive to many products i tried
am very skeptical about spending $90 on such a small amount

even though i used my clarisonic smart profile

right off the bat i'd like to say i highly dislike their unscientific claims of being a "detoxifying" mask
kept looking at my skin for an unhealthy amount of time
however my extremely dry skin had left me with very few options that don't leave my face flaky
my blackheads are either extremely minimized or completely cleared out
it is too expensive considering the size

i love it for many reasons: first that it is ultra-hydrating
