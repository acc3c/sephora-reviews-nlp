not my favorite scent
just give the cologne to my bf
because it contains 3% oatmeal
i apply this indigo cream
the indigo cream feels a little tack-y or sticky sometimes
paired with the camellia oil
do i now have geisha perfect skin?
naturally strawberry blonde hair
the packaging is also lovely
this one is very soothing
hoping the colloidal oatmeal would be soothing
the face cream is a sort of strange texture
doesn't leave any blue or purple hue
so one day i tried a sample of this indigo cream
i like that it is fragrance free.
t has a slight brine scent
it has a light, pleasant scent.
i love the texture
this cream feels very luxurious
love the whole indigo line.
has a unique scent from the indigo
have never had a reaction from any soothing indigo product from tatcha
creamy consistency it would cause a break-out
the gold camellia beauty oil would be wonderful for dryer skin as i have about every line out there
the tiny gold flakes are nice mixed with the camellia
the gold camellia beauty oil is beautifully packaged
after using tatcha's gold camellia beauty oil for over a month
this beauty oil smells divine
if you compare the price tag of this beauty oil to de's marula oil
so were on the second bottle of the oil while using indigo cream
i love this camellia beauty oil.
the scent is very calming yet uplifting at the same time
highly recommend tatcha's camilla beauty oil
spray the luminous dewy skin mist on right after
this product is divine.
the tatcha gold camelia beauty oil is incredibly light
it smells divine and makes me feel like royalty.
i wake up with soft, smooth, scented skin.
i actually mix this with the tarte maracuja oil
i got this in a set with the camellia lip balm
just after one day using this beauty oil i swear my dewy
the brush is cute
first off, i love the scent of this.
love the the coconut scent
kinda like a piña colada
it's a coconut or piña colada type of smell?
it smells like coconuts without resembling sun screen smell
left a nice residue that smelled like pina colada on my skin
maybe it's the yummy fruity sweet scent
it has a bit of a strong scent
and its a beautiful sparkly silver colour!!
using the delightful massage technique
the packaging is lovely too!
it has no fragrance
coconut oil on my arms
i've also been using farmacy's honey mask
love that is doesn't have a scent also!
even ones that were "fragrance-free" were not so fragrance-free after all
she said it was mild, gentle, and fragrance free.
love that this product if free of fragrance
this bar of soap is a gem.
fab products all claim to be soothing
it has a very very light lemony smell to it

scent really isn't overpowering
this light cream has a notable fragrance
f you are scent sensitive
i love the scent
there is a golden/rose hue
i wish it was a perfume.
i also love the purple blue tube!
side note: i love the sudsy lather
it has a nice fresh grapefruit scent instead of the typical acne medicinal scent
smells amazing, like orange sherbert.
if i want a subtle highlight i use it on my high points then blend with a beauty blender
not in a sparkler in your face kind of way
the scent does linger
four stars because it's quite heavily fragranced
the smell is wonderfully tropical without being overpowering
not to mention the scent smells delicious
like sweet vanilla cake frosting
as he loves the scent also
it's a very pleasant orange sherbert smell.
love the delicate scent too.
it has a yummy orange creamsicle smell
most of all i loved the orange creamsicle scent
i also can't stand the scent.
in love with this .. beautiful natural glow
fast-absorbing cream that smells like sugary citrus
plus, the scent is delicious.
it has such a beautiful, subtle glow i just love.
layer my champagne pop over it while its damp for a gorgeous glow

it smells just like skittles mixed with a pink starburst
the subtle energizing scent are great added bonuses

reminds me of a cheap orange popsicle.
it has a light sweet smell like an orange cream a little bit goes along way instant highlight when applied
i don't mind the scent

however i gave it 4 stars because of the "fragrance"
i love the creamy but non greasy texture.
i much prefer a temporary smell to having synthetic or toxic fragrance in the ingredients
it has a slightly sweet scent
it smells like rose hip oil
my skin is dry as a dessert in the winter
rose hip oil that is infused with an amazing array of botanicals
this product has a earthy
vanilla scent that absorbs quickly
scents in products never bother me
the vanilla extract fragrance that is in the product is too strong for me
personally, i find it intoxicating!
it smells like a combo of vanilla and tobacco.
even though i was layering the argan oil
this is a beautiful face oil.
argan from "natural" lines
those aren't all pure oils
nice subtle citrus scent
i love the scent
just not a fan of the scent.
the texture is amazing and the bottle is big.
i love the really small scrubby beads
i read reviews about a citrusy scent
the scent is not strong which i like
this has become my holly grail of skin care
leave faces smooth and has a pleasant scent.
love the peony line!
the creamy texture is heavy and silicone based.
it doesn't have a scent or a tint
with a pink marshmallow texture

it has a pleasant vanilla-ish sent that lingers for a while after application
it does have a stronger scent
i wish they made a perfume out of it!!
i've ordered the other egg mellow products as well
it has a soft vanilla ice cream type of smell
i dont mind the scent
start using this egg mellow cream
i see others don't like the "fragrance"
i don't have an issue with the scent of this product--
i do notice a slight raw egg smell
was skeptical due to fragrance in cream
the scent is nice
first, the scent is wonderful --- light, sweet.
it's creamy but not heavy.
it also has a great scent.
the egg mellow cream is a 5 in 1 day cream
who doesn't want to try that?it's texture is both creamy
the fragrance is nice :
i love the scent
while there is a scent to it
i think it's a light fresh scent
scent of products is very personal
i will mention that i'm not sensitive to most scents
unlike other reviewers i loved the scent!
the scent is cross between vanilla
it's unusual to have a strong scent for a facial cream
1 minus star for a strong scent
i happen to enjoy the light scent
i am willing to sacrifice scent for beauty
there is no fragrance which i enjoy in my skin care products
the color is a champagne color
i am in love with the shimmer in it
the camellia cleansing oil
followed by a mist of the luminous dewy skin mist

the formula itself doesn’t seem to have a scent
it has a very strong citrus aroma that made my eyes water at first
this mask is refreshing
i agree that this mask has a strong scent
however to me it is a pleasant herbal smell
i absolutely adored the citrus scent
it does have an overwhelming smell similar to cheap citrus vodka
that's probably why it smelt like vodka

i don't get how it smells like vodka
the scent is very strong
also the scent is amazing
i love a good citrus scent
the scent will about knock you over--to me it smells like a shot of vodka--

it also has a nice, light, green tea fragrance.
this foam feels like velvet
suede all put together

first of all, who doesn't love green tea?!
sephora will start carrying the cranberry one

was instantly drawn to the tester because of its silky
the limited edition mango smells amazing

i find the smell pleasant and herbal.
the scent of the lancôme is lovely

i didn't mind the scent before
creamy for my skin
creamy for my skin
it has a really fresh but really light scent.
many of whom have olive skin or golden undertones
i love it because it's not a shimmery or oily glow
a scent that's very fresh
i like to mix my tinted beauty balm with it to thin it out
although the formula is watery
i don't have any sensitivity to fragrance
some are derived from plants like coconut or palm
i personally don't mind the scent
although the formula is watery
i really love the scent
this moisturizer smells like mango aloe which makes me know it's love at first sight
very light scent that doesn't linger
it will cause the powder to "cake"
only con is the fragrance
i also like that it doesn't really have a fragrance
has a nice light fragrance
t like fragrance as it is intense

i like the crisp refreshing scent.
the fragrance is too strong
the only downside is the fragrance is too strong
it has pinkish shimmer in it.

i love this luminescent cream
i love the beautiful iridescent finish
nose were kisses by rosey angelic realness
oily skin with pink undertones
no fragrance or residue.
as someone who is not affected by scents very often
started taking evening primrose pills
used apple cider vinegar
if you've ever used melaleuca oil
you'll recognize the scent
the scent is herbal/medicinal
the second ingredient is black cumin seed oil
cumin is not ordinarily a smell i like on my person
it smells sort of medicinal.
this does have a strong herbal scent
drunk elephant marula oil
drunk elephant lala retro whipped cream
if you've ever used essential oils it has a similar scent
not filled with artificial fragrances
i don't mind the scent at all
the oils in here are such a unique brilliant blend
it's not a "beauty oil"
it smells like a spa.
the scent of the black cumin seed was a little overwhelming at first
the scent fades away
i love the smell, the color, the name.
since i'm sensitive to added fragrances
i mix the korres wild rose oil
kind of a herbal-ly scent
pungent scent that is pine-ish
the scent doesn't stick around for long
it's very herbal medicinal smelling.
i actually enjoy the scent because it smells medicinal
without any artificial scents
lovely marmalade-like smell and consistency.
i love the orange scent.
the scent is an invigorating citrus.
the texture is similar to a jam
it has a fun, fruity texture.

it tastes just like orange
the crushed fruit smells amazing
a very natural orange smell
the chunks of fruit make this mask feel so luxurious
this is a gorgeous mask!
the texture is like jam... which i found odd.
this is such a lovely, fresh mask.
it seriously looks like marmalade
it has real pieces of citrus
being that my favorite perfume is miss dior
because the tiny bits of citrus fruit stuck to my skin
it smells like oranges!
this has great peices of fruit
feels like i'm spreading marmalade on my skin
aside from it smelling delectable
kind of reminds me of clementines or oranges.
it smells just like fresh fruit
it's scent was delicious fruity tangy smell.
t is like you have fruit chunks in a consistency like orange pulp
i didn't have any redness despite the high citrus fruit content
almost feels like putting orange marmalade on your face

this feels like putting orange marmalade on the skin
love the fruity smell n skin is so smooth n glowing after just one use
this is a 50% real fruit mask ladies
the fruit complex in this really helped with my texture
the scent is nice
the chunks of citrus fruit rind didn't bother me
has the texture of jam
looked like mango preserves to me
i know it's supposed to smell like orange citrus
the texture of the mask itself is a little off-putting as it reminds me of orange marmalade
it's because of the real crushed citrus fruits
perfume shouldn't be on the face
i also like the mild, tofu-like smell.
there's a natural fresh aroma that i quite enjoy
i love the scent
has a yummy floral scent that's refreshing
the product definitely has a distinct fragrance
i find it nicely floral --

normally scents don't really bother me
this particular one has an herbal scent that is a little overwhelming
the scent is natural
i must say that i was never a huge fan of tata harper's moisturizers/serums due to the strong floral scents
the floral scent is not too strong
love the silky-ness of the creme.

i think it smells like lemony
was using glam glows thirsty mud which didnt have a lasting difference
i used raw honey on my face
i loved the texture
i love how the sticky honey turns into a creamy
it feels very luxurious and spa-like.

if the seductive warmth of the mask isn't intoxicating enough
for those that have done straight manuka honey masks this is similar still sticky

the warming effect is very soothing!
s the soft gooey texture of the mask

smells more like an organic product
perhaps it is the propolis?
soft-touching skin which i expected since it the packaging it so beautiful like honey
i love the warming sensation of the mask.
the ingredients in this mask are not actual honey
i enjoyed the honey potion mask almost as much as the other farmacy products

your homegirl has naturally red skin
or a tall latte that is tons of foam #disappointing 2
blend it with a beauty blender that has been dampened
i put this magical cream on
not cakey or heavy
light- medium with neutral undertones
i can't stand products in pots and jars.

it has a similar consistency to coconut oil.
it comes in a "solid" coconut oil consistency
the fact that it doesn't have a strong fragrance
i am fussy with eye cream.
because it is so creamy
it's also very soothing .
this eye cream is like a cup of coffee for your eyes

may coop raw sauce
herbal scent that i personally really enjoyed
has a pleasant subtle scent
it's soothing to the skin

this scent is very subtle
as far as the scent
there were no harsh scents either
i found the scent fresh
it has a nice mild scent
i can't get enough of the scent-- subtle
i actually like that lxmi hasn't covered up the scents of the plants in the product with perfumes

i loved the ingredient mix
the cream is a touch rich.
this face cream is so silky
this cream is packed full of goodness
this cream is fabulous!
it doesn't have an overwhelming perfumed smell nor an overly earthy odor like some oils
looks very chic on my bathroom counter
a pleasantly-scented gel cleanser
at first i was nervous because of the high fragrance in the oil
is very fragrant like a unisex cologne
also has a soft scent to it
i like the scent of the oil better then the bar
comes in adorable packaging
it has a unisex marine scent that is pretty light
first, the packaging is very chic and modern.
if you care about scent
erno laszlo phelityl cleansing bar make out of rich botanical oils such as rosemary extract

the product was gentle

the only part i did not care for was that it was a floral scent
it has a very mild and soothing scent.
it would blend perfectly
no scent which i appreciate!
it does not have a super perfume-y smell.
the cleansing oil is chock full of skin loving ingredients like green tea

foamy or creamy cleansers
i personally love matcha
it's got a bit of the matcha scent
wish it'd smell a little bit more green leafy though
it rather has more of a creamy scent next to the matcha one for me
this matcha mask doesn't leave the skin feeling as soft
the scent is almost grassy.
i prefer good ingredients to harmful nice-smelling fragrances though
i used the origins mushroom lotion to mix with the powder
i really love the texture of this cream
this cream is so soothing
has a slight lemongrass smell to it
need to avoid all the scents
has a vv light scent and absorbs super quickly.
u will feel a tingling hot/cold sensation

we are so used to fragrance
chemicals in our products that we are off-put by the earthy scent of natural products
this salve has the consistency of very thick honey
i am extremely sensitive to smells which is why majority of perfumes
it is a honey based product
i love any honey
i love the faint scent of honey.
i am loving the natural ingredients
expect gently remind me of honey
the chai tea powder didn't impress me as much
the rooibos is probably my favorite mask discovery of 2016
another great product from tarte!
it yields a beautiful soft glow
it was super shimmery which i loved
i love being shimmery so this was perfect!
the shimmer that is has is very subtle in indoor lighting
looks great when paired with the tarte rainforest of the sea foundation
it's perfect under powder to give a hint of a dewy glow
so this has a pearl-like luminescence.
it is very shimmery
like a b+bw diamond shimmer mist
the glitter isn't chunky
it has a faint pleasant scent.
maybe different batches are more shimmery?
this has enough glow to pop through my makeup as a natural dew
silky formula with soothing effects.
this cream is soothing

loved the texture of it

was skeptical because of the fragrance
i've seen all the complaints about the fragrance
to me the fragrance is no big deal
if i had to describe the fragrance
i'd say old-fashioned floral
i wouldn't buy it as a perfume
it has an odd spice smell to it
it has a acidic smell
i'd much prefer having the smell than the flowery/citrusy fragrances that would do nothing
if you like having feminine smelling products
if you are expecting a citrus smell
has no harsh perfumes or anything to irritate
love the texture of this.. thick and creamy.
i love the whipped texture
it also smells wonderful and hydrates my skin.
it has a pink tint to it
it doesn't smell like coconuts
it's smells like delicious coconut
although if you're not into scented products or coconut then you'll hate it
it smells like coconut
also blend while still wet
i love the subtle shimmer
it's also incredibly shimmery.
it has a subtle coconut scent
it smells of coconuts of course
the only other ones i've used are the tarte rainforest spray
i love the glow
like real coconuts- not the fake smell
i couldn't really smell the coconut scent
it smells like some kind of artificial coconut or something
reading into it there is actually no artificial fragrance which is amazing
nothing magic, but light and lovely.
the scent is very mild almost no scent
pleasant scent, great for travel.
i live for the green tea formula.
the green tea mineral water
it is so soothing
the green tea one stinks.
it has a nice floral fragrance it's not strong it's very faint
i got the charcoal and the green tea.
smells great and tones skin.
i tried the charcoal and green tea waters.
particularly the green tea
the fragrance is lovely while applying
love this coconut line.
the scent is to die for
i don't mind the scent of the charcoal at all
i don't think the coconut one smells like coconuts
if something says coconut
the coconut smell is so yummy
i love the charcoal one so far
the coconut is heavenly right now
the charcoal formula doesn't smell great
especially the green tea
the scent however isn't particularly strong
the scent is not overpowering so it's perfect.
i wish the green tea didn't have exfoliants.
love the green tea cleansing
a pleasant rose scent that lingers for a very short time
love the scent though!
the only complaint i have is the strong fragrance
i absolutely love the fragrance
the fragrance isn't to strong
the scent is strong at first
it has a slight scent that i can't describe

it's so silky soft
kale cream with a slightly different texture
great on my medium light olive skin.
velvet texture not at all thick
it's too dark for my ginger skin
the scent is fairly light
this product works wonders to keep me mate while still using things like tarte rainforest of the sea foundation
this is pure magic!
it smells like just ripened peaches
it has a cool tingle that is refreshing
i find this face wash so creamy
the scent is soothing
reminiscent of great herbal tea
and the dewy feeling is intoxicating.
the scent is pleasant
it doesn't have any fake scents
the scent is very strong
it has a very refreshing chocolate smell which at first seems a little over powering
if "cocoa moisture mask" works for me
not like fake chocolate
love that it smells like chocolate
i can still smell a hint of chocolate leftover
it also left a mild chocolate scent which was pleasant
this stuff is magic in a bottle!!!
apply drunk elephant's virgin marula luxury facial oil
elixirs all promising to noticeably change texture
i follow up with a tiny bit of the virgin marula luxury facial oil as suggested on the packaging

creamier to me when i apply it
the reserve is decadent
as for the scent
i'd rather have that than have the natural planty smell covered up by gross synthetic perfumes
the oil has a very botanical/essential oil type scent which i didn't find bad at all
i don't mind scents as long as the product works.
argan milk this = magic :
tarte with marula oil which is close to argan oil
i love that there is no noticeable fragrance
it is a very lovely bottle
beautiful packaging and a beautiful product .
if you are sensitive to fragrance though it will probably cause sensitivity because it smell heavily of an orange creamsicle
i love the citrusy scent
as long as you like orange/citrus

thought the cream smelled a bit like dish soap
the subtle orange smell of the moisturizer isn't half bad either

not overbearing but so sweet - like candy!
please don't ever change this glow recipe!!!!

namely the bitter orange flower water
i love the light scent of this
this is by far the best essences i've ever use.
this blueberry cleanser is wonderful.
the smell was subtle, clean and fruity.
this product smells 100% like fresh blueberries
as blueberry is one of my favorite fruits of all time
minus its strong tea tree scent
there are pieces of real blueberry suspended in glow recipe’s cleanser
i love all the natural botanical extracts
the fragrance also starts off somewhat blueberry if you use your imagination
i think it needs to smell more tart to capture “blueberry” notes
philosophy will be drunk elephant’s beste cantaloupe cleanser
i love the real blueberries and the smell too
it smells of fresh blueberries like you're walking through a field of blueberry trees
kinda wish the watermelon mask didn't have fragrance
sweet potato is a good touch

not overwhelming or perfume-like
like a dead animal mixed with a fermented fruit haha

this lip mask is so buttery, glossy and silky!
it has a bubblegum scent that reminds me of being a kid :
the spells and tastes amazing.

my trusted bite agave lip mask every night at bedtime wasn't helping
the little silicon applicator was another delightful surprise
the scent is a nice
subtle whiff of cranberries/strawberries
it has a pink hue
i mainly loved it for the scent
the scent is pretty light
sort of smells like strawberry banana
so even if you're sensitive to scents
i also don't notice much of a flavor to it
it almost smells like a fruit
like a flower at the same time?

tea tree oil as a moisturizer

it almost smells like a cross between pumpkin pie
brown sugar cinnamon quaker instant oatmeal
it also has a subtle/delicious oatmeal scent
very pleasant scent as well
while i don't love the texture of this mask
the texture of this is like a lotion/cream with small chunks of gooey oatmeal in it

like a fake grapey scent mixed with dirt
this is some kind of miracle concoction.
this is a little medicinal smelling

it was just too creamy

however usually when a skincare vitamin c product smells like oranges
it's due to perfume or essential oils

luxurious oil like consistency
blends well with drunk elephants other products

it smells a little bit metallic
beautiful looking skin or beautiful smelling skin?
candles should smell great, not facial products.
because of another active ingredient that gives it that orange hue
has a very sour taste
no the scent doesn't smell like a creamsicle like some other c serums
that's because they don't add artificial fragrance
great formula, light scent.
